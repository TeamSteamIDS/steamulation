												Alone, with friends or with complete strangers, monaco is by far one of the best coop games i've ever played. If you don't mind  feeling the adrenaline pumping to your brains the first few missions you're given, you'll find that Monaco: what's yours is mine is much deeper than just heists  organized by french pixelized criminals and cheesy french lines randomly tossed by guards emailing their parents about how they finally got a good job (not) chasing you. It's about not dying; it's about cleaning a level, to see how far you can go for a bunch of lousy coins. When you finally avoided all the lasers, the guards, the dogs, the chopper; when you've asserted your domination over the rich and glorious city-state of Monaco, all you got to do now is to play the levels again and again to ultimately clean out Identity without alarming the guards once.Allez mon vieux, t'as rien a faire ici!Now with Zombies, boobytraps and Bazookas:                                                               CERVEAU!

												Monaco truly is a game for anyone and everyone. It is simple enough to pick up and immediately understand how things work, while at the same time offers the complexity to have multiple players spend a few minutes sitting still, devising a self-titled ""Best Plan Ever"" complete with tracing the plan on the screen with fingers, saying “Ready? GO!”, only to see it backfire in seconds.The easy learning curve, the variety of characters, the sprawling levels, and the lovely sound and art all combine to make an extremely appealing and replayable game. Monaco offers a new and unique kind of chaotic co-op stealth gameplay, resulting in a work of indie art worth stealing.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												You know those games where everything is perfect? The music is awesome, the play feels great, there's a bunch of variety and it never gets old because every time you play a level again you try doing something different that changes the whole thing?Yeah, me neither. Or at least I didn't until I tried this game.The game revolves around... Well, it differs between levels. Sometimes you're making a heist, sometimes you're rescuing someone, and sometimes you're simply getting the f--k out of there.The game is well balanced with multiple characters, each with different pros and cons. One of my personal favorites, the pickpocket, has a little pet monkey that follows him and gets coins for him. See that coin just out of reach because you'd trigger an alarm to get it? Let monkey Hector get it.Then there's, say, the cleaner. See a guard blocking your way? He can just sneak up on him and put him to sleep with good ol' clorophorm.Then there's a locksmith, that, you guessed it, picks locks, safes, ATMs, everything twice to three times as fast as everyone else.Then there's a looko-- you get the point.The music also plays a part, mostly because it's 1- Dynamic and 2-Wonderful.Seriously, you can just see some of the music in this game by going in this link: http://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/monaco-gentlemans-private-collection-bundleThis music was made by the same guy who made the music to Journey. And we all know how wonderful that turned out.The game also has a full fledged workshop with a level editor that, while awkward at first, has literally every single thing in the actual game. See something in game? You can do it in the editor too. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's the same editor they used to make the levels in the game.But don't be fooled by it's cartoonish graphics, because under that pixelated looking exterior, is a whole story full of drama, plot twists, foreshadowing... And you can play the piano. Yes, that's right, you can play on a f--king piano. With friends. There's even an achievement for doing so.My point is, what are you doing still reading this? Seriously, this is a huge wall of text. Unless you skipped straight to the end. Either way, stop reading this, and go buy the game. Now. I want more friends to play with me, because, you know. The more the merrier!			",136,21,3,13,27,4,34

												Imagine if old GTA games, Chip's Challenge, and Oceans 11 all stumbled into a blender owned by a Lego man.Boy what a mess that would be. Thankfully, Monaco is 'not' a mess, but rather, a stealth heist game in which you and up to three other thieves band together to plunder the money of a variety of facilities in and around Monte Carlo, everything ranging from Casinos to Hospitals to High Security Prisons, being represented.The game's two virtues are its deceptive level of gameplay depth, and its humorous design aesthetic. It's the personality hidden behind the neon pixels that at first attracts one to this game--the perplexingly simple yet expressive character designs go along with the frantic piano ragtime and silly french NPC voices, to be extremely memorable. You'll laugh as your little colorful lego thief pees in a toilet, wiggles their hands to hack a PC hollywood style, or hugs a wall and takes deep, ragged breaths after being shot--to the accompaniment of bloodied footprints left in their step. And as your little Mr. Pink dies from that one guard who peaks just inside your hiding place to bop you with a wrench, they explode into a neon pink colored skeleton, and the music thuds to an abrupt halt--only for the music to pick up again where it left off, once your fellow criminals put your guts back in (to the sound of hilarious squishing noises).As for the gameplay, it's definitely the part that keeps you playing Monaco, long after you're familiar with its pretty pixel face. On the one hand, you can be a sneaky, super subtle player who never gets caught, never trips a trap, never fires a shot. It can at first be a difficult process to do so, as you're forced to learn by trial and error (due to the game's sparse tutorial elements) how to remain undetected.On the flip side, however, Monaco, unlike some of its compatriots in the sneak-em-up genre, never trips over the hurdle of forced stealth. You can shoot people down in a bloody Scarface-esque machinegun massacre, lure guards and civilians into side areas off patrol and give them a wrench over the head, 40's femme fatale style, or be a clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, cut the circuit breaker in a particularly well-guarded facility, and just 'camp' the power room subduing guards who come with chloroform, while your (debatably) coordinated teammates do the legwork.In fact, if you're in a hurry, it can sometimes be better just to run aggressively past NPCs, dodging from cover to cover to avoid security agent machinegun fire, or to climb in a vent duct to escape angry attack dogs who are onto your scent, rather than trying to outstealth them. And as a result of this flexibility, at first, it seems like Monaco will be trivially easy to play and win. But Monaco is a stern teacher, and it knows how to steadily ramp up the difficulty to keep you challenged through around thirty-some different, replayable missions. As you go, new classes and items are introduced to the formula, along with new map features like security-trigger handscans, computer viruses, alarm-triggering ATMs that must be busted open for cash, and more. The game is incredibly flexible in its approach, and each class is nuanced enough to be distinct from its brethren. (The one class I am not personally fond of is the Pickpocket, which tends to encourage reckless, self-serving tactics over cooperation, at lower levels of play experience.) However, the classes are not so distinct that they cannot all perform basic functions like opening a safe, or hacking a PC--it's just that some classes do these things more efficiently than others. So there will rarely be a point where you play a mission 'exactly' the same as the last time you played it, as you tackle obstacles in a level best suited to whatever class you are playing at the time.Lastly, there 'is' a story to the game, consisting mostly of text dialogue, but which is filled with humor and an actually relatively intriguing plot, fleshing out the personalities and origins of the thieves you play as. The thieves themselves have some pretty charming tics--the Hacker is constantly making references to PC error codes and computer shorthand terminology, the Gentleman is your 'World's Most Interesting Man', complete with his own little intrigue and espionage plot, the Cleaner is a stoic psychopath who rarely speaks beyond deep heavy breaths, and the Mole has a terse Serbian accent and a Freedom Spoon which he employs with a mixture of bravado and thuggish loyalty.The game does suffer from a poor matchmaking system, which is a bit prone to lag and connectivity issues. Also, the menu options are a bit confusing, and there is one bug with using a controller that prevents mouse usage until your machine is restarted--so if you tend to use a controller for some games, like Gauntlet or Dark Souls, but prefer a mouse and keyboard for Monaco, you may run into complications where your mouse doesn't want to work to aim guns til you pull a soft reset on your OS.All in all, I give Monaco a thumbs up. There are a lot of visual tweaks that could probably make finding your way in the maps a bit easier, the story could use some accompanying visuals (even if just still scenes), and the tutorial aspects of the game are sorely lacking even after a custom tutorial map was added--but the game just has so much complexity and charm, that it's hard not to pick it up from time to time, if you can get past those hiccups long enough to get into the meat of the game.Grab it if you don't have it, and see if you can't wrangle some friends into the heist with you on headsets. At worst, it'll make for an amusing weekend of cartoon criminal hijinx.			",98,30,0,12,3,1,2

												Absolutely recommended. I originally got it with the Indie Mega Booth pack, since six games for $20 was a steal. I'd never heard of Monaco before that, and I fell in love almost right away. The soundtrack is great - all jazzy piano that changes intensity depending on if you're sneaking or being chased; the game itself is gorgeous, very colorful but not blinding; some levels can be difficult, but with persistence and planning you can get through it. 10/10 would recommend.

												A game of intrique, mystery and most importantly, teamwork. Monaco is a game that revolves around a gang of criminals who plan a series of heists to escape from jail, and to escape from the suspicion of the law. Throughout the course of the game, players will choose different and unique character classes (mole, locksmith, cleaner, hacker) who utilize special skills (digging through walls, opening safes, knocking people out, diasbling security systems) and a vast array of thieving tools ranging from shotguns to smokebombs in order to perform heists. The game features a unique top-down blueprint perspective that, when a good plan goes through, feels like a scene out of the Oceans 11 series. While the game on single player is enough, it's the multiplayer that truly makes this title worth a purchase. Local Co-op and Online Co-op (these are mutually exclusive in this case) let you have fun with friends and strangers, and friendly strangers around the world. That being said though, multiplayer is also one of the biggest caveats of the monaco experience. Servers can be unreliable at times and the leaderboards seldom update or never record scores, if it all. This can create some frustration since a really fun aspect of Monaco is planning routes and heists and seeing how these strategies stack up against other players. While this game is a personal favorite of mine, I recognize that this type of game isn't for everyone. Very often do I see others online who treat this game more like smash tv than splinter cell and the game punishes you heavily for just running in guns a blazin'. so if you're looking for a typical high speed shooter experience, this isn't going to be your thing.tl;dr This game is about stealing♥♥♥♥♥♥like nobody even knew they took a♥♥♥♥♥♥ You gotta get gud or go home.Pros:+Music is awesome and atmospheric+Gameplay is top notch+Online Multiplayer is enjoyable+Workshop Enabled+If you like games with a story that makes you think, this is greatCons:-Might not be for everybody, which will probably ruin your smooth heist experience-Online leaderboards don't update as often as they should-Servers can be kind of iffy at certain timesThis game is 9 vinegar husbands out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(This game was rated Overwhelmingly positive, I have no idea why it says mixed. Must be bug ;-;)This game is underrated. Very nice design and awesome game play. Never gets boring and is challenging no matter how good you are at the game, you will be learning new things about every time you play!WHY DIS GAME IS GOOD:HUGE REPLAY VALUE: There are 8 classes, many play styles, a workshop, 5 achievements for each level, multiplayer, and 2 game modes. Which makes a combination of 480 ways you can play each level. There are 50+ levels and workshop!!!CHALLENGING:No matter how many hours you have, you will always be learning new tricks and the game never gets boring.SIMPLE CONTROLS :If you want to, you can play this game with only your left hand, that is right! WASD and space bar! It’s so nicely designed and simple, easy to learn but hard to master.GREAT LEARNING CURVE: Perfect level designs, you will never feel like you are stuck on a level but each one is a challenge and a checkpoint to make sure you are ready for the next. None of the levels feel receptive and you learn something new after each level. Very nicely ordered.SOMEONE FOR EVERYONE: There are 8 classes and each has a very unique play style, so even on the same level you can have 8 different experiences when playing.CREATIVITY: You can make your own maps and there are tons of maps on the workshop for you to download. Getting bored of just heists? You can make race maps, death runs, PvP’s. It’s like it’s own g-mod.VERY NICE COMMUNITY: The community has some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. It’s kind of a small community so the older players are very nice and will try to help you in game if you have any questions.TAKE YOUR TIME: Rounds can be long or short depending on weather you go stealthy or do a speed run, so it fits everyone’s play style. If you need to leave soon and want to play something for 10 minutes, this is the game for you. If you want to play for an hour, or half a day, this is still the game for you ;)ADDICTING: You always feel you can play “one more round” and by the time you realize it’s already the next day….STEAM PLATFORM: Very nicely linked to STEAM.  Creating lobbies and inviting friends are super convenient as well as uploading your custom maps.DEVELOPMENT: Runs super smoothly, hardly any bugs. The devs are nice and they are working on a new game atm! Go check it out =w=HIT ON PEOPLE: Simple to add friends with a easy “view steam profile” button. GREAT SOUNDTRACK EDITING: Music is excellent! The rhythm even changes when you are being chased, giving you a clue weather its safe to run or not.EASY TO LEARN: Whole interface and character designs are very nicely done.NEVER GET ENOUGH OF MONACO:The map editor is very simple to pick up and after reading a guide or two you’ll be a pro map maker.GOOD FOR LAPTOPS: Small game file, barely takes up any space for laptop users like me. A game you can play in class or on the go ;)ZOMBIES OR NOT:There is a zombie mode if that’s your fetish ;)MULTIPLAYER: Everyone can only use one class, making you feel dedicated to your role. The maps are designed so you can wander off on your own but also be very useful as a group.WHY THE HECK ARE YOU READING THIS JUST BUY THE DARN GAME!!!IF THIS IS ON SALE AND YOU S T I L L  AREN’T BUYING THEN YOU’D BE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE!!!!! >:D just get it cause diamonds will make you feel better!!

												short, glib review: Benny Hill Skit Simulator 2013 (later patched to become the Superior Sociopath Simulator 2014)Let's be frank here, most of you have this from a Humble Bundle or 20 now. It's a good game, BUT, play it MP. Find a pal or three and co-op the campaign. Push through to the end of the first one* at least, it's around 18 stages. You'll get new thieves as time goes on, experiment, shake up who uses what if you're stuck. It's a great game in this context. Solo, though, it's kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥stealth title. I played half of the game alone and it involved more skulking than stealing.It's fun! It just requires pals to really bring out the true chaotic underbelly of the game as someone lingers a second too long and suddenly all the guards are rushing towards one corner of the manor and do you help that guy or do you jack everything you can in the meantime and maybe pick up his corpse later? No honor among thieves, you know.Enjoyed the hell out of it - stopped after campaign #1 because my group finally went ""Yeah, that's a good amount.""* There are 4. Do not let it be said this game didn't get post-release support, the final patch added an entirely new set of missions on top of two entirely redesigned game modes and a crazy amount of Workshop support.

												Greeetings all potential buyers of Monaco!Pull your chairs in, and listen to the sound of my voice:Monaco is a fantastic game. That's the first thing to keep in mind throughout this review. For an Indie game, I am suprised as to how polished and nice looking the game is, with no bugs that I have found or are aware of. The soundtrack is fantastic, and is one of the many things that keeps me coming back to this game. Another great thing about it, is that you can just jump into it and have some fun with it. There is not a lot of tutorial needed to know what you are doing in this game. It is more of a stealth game, than a shooter such as Hotline Miami. Another point that I want to go over, is the Co-Op mode. Although I do not have a lot of experience with this, from what I remember, it was great fun to see how you can help your friends out with completing a mission as fast as possible. You can look at the game as a casual indie game, but you can also get competitive and try for the leaderboards.This game has a lot of depth to it. It does very well at creating atmosphere for the player, and it is a lot of fun to just run around the area to not get spotted. Even though the storyline is a little bit thin, it is not the main selling point of this game. If you want a game that you can just jump in an play with for a good amount of time, and not get bored with it, I highly HIGHLY recommend this title!So go, run, get out your wallet and GET THIS GAME NOW! It has won a multitude of prizes from proffesionals, so don't take my word for it, try reading some other (more proffesional) reviews online, to get convinced of how amazing this game is!

												This is a well built stealth game, a game genre we are lacking in quality.You have your choice of several characters, each with unique abilities and unique styles to play through the maps.What this game offers is more variability of gameplay. If you're spotted or set off an alarm, you have options. You can try gunning down the enemies, running around corners, sneaking behind a nearby bush or running for a vent. It takes time to get through them though, time the enemy can pummel or shoot you. Unlike other stealth games, a well planned out escape won't necessarily lead to death if you're clever.The difficulty curve is really well done. You're consistently unlocking new content and styles of gameplay with every level, the challenge slowly increasing. If you die, it doesn't feel like such a failure compared to other games because you learn. I actually found it fun to die. While playing co-op, death adds an extra layer of difficulty of: How do I get my teammate back up?The in game dialogue is clever and cheeky. There is strong depth of gameplay here. I even like the basic 2d graphics, it feels uncluttered and consistent compared to other games. The smaller and quality nature of the maps make the game forgiving of failure.The bad would be finding enough people to play the later levels with, the few co-op games that lag, and dying on the later levels after an arduous journey through four levels.I highly recommend the game. I give it a solid 8.5.			",288,152,5,54,30,3,49

This should be on the steam MUST-HAVE pack. For such a fun indie game I wouldn't be surprised if we saw this title on ios sometime soon. I do not know about IPod but IPad will be in the APP store soon.- 9.63/10			",47,6,0,1,5,0,3

												I've a strange relation with Monaco. And a strange tale to tell.When the game came out, I didn't believe in it. I was very interested by the concept, but really put out by the graphisms. You see, I hate this game of ""faux retro"" graphic style a lot of people use nowdays to surf on the wave of nostalgia, especially when they could totally make games look better using their technology and talent. So the game at first was no more than a missed opportunity to me.Enter Kotton, a friend of mine, who told me I should really give the game a try. I wasn't convinced. So, as he often does to try to force my hand, he gifted it to me. Game was small, I decided to download it and give it a try.And oh boy, what a gem did I found. Let me get things straight: I WAS WRONG. So very very wrong.Monaco is an awesome game with a very strong ambiance, the graphic style has its own strange blocky charm. It takes a while to get used to it gameplay-wise, but when you do, it's all smooth sailing.The gameplay is extremly solid. Everything happens for a reason and by knowing how things work, you can make the better of them. There is only a limited amount of RNG.The scenario is interesting and to the casual player, Monaco has the big advantage of being extremly funny when things go wrong, turning into a Benny Hill comedy with guards chasing the characters around in a total chaos while the alarms are blaring and everyone tries to scramble for a good hiding spot. To the more result-focused player, the game is also interesting, with a scoring system dependant of both efficiency and speed, a strong speedrunning community, and some pretty challenging maps to boot.Every character has its own specificities, meaning multiplayer is always a treat(in good or bad), and allow a great amount of teamplay.I ended up loving this game so much I gifted it in turn to something else, hoping to share the love, and retablishing balance in the world, as an apology to not believing in it to begin with.Don't exactly expect a top view shooter though, this is not what Monaco is. Monaco is a pure stealth game, and a solid one at that. It does have some shooting, but to a limited extent, and to be used strategically. If you can get it during a sale, you will probably pay it something like 2 euros or so, and at that price, it's pretty much... A steal.			",184,8,0,25,12,1,30

												Pretty amazing game all things considered. It's been around for a year now, so the price is lower than release, and I'm sure you can get it for next to nothing from either a Humble Bundle, or waiting on a Steam sale.As you can see from previews, it's a top down sneaking/stealing game. You've got eight characters total, each with their own main ability, and a less noticeable side ability. Example, if going by the preview, the Lookout is the expert at Recon, which means when she's sneaking/stationary, everyone gets red icons on the map indicating where guards/civilians are, even when not in vision.Her secondary power is that she opens ladders/vents 3 times as fast as anyone else. The main power of each class is the draw, but often you'll find the secondary power is incredibly useful as well.There are a rich amount of stories, though given that this game is a year old now, online co-op can be somewhat hit or miss. There are still players, but you might not be able to get a game every time you look. Another frustration is that later missions become really very difficult for a solo player to beat. It's always completely possible, though sometimes it requires some extra work. This really is a game that benefits from co-op.As people have mentioned, getting seen or alerting guards will not be the end of you, and in fact is required sometimes to move guards out of position. That said, later missions in say the 2nd story or the epilogue will punish you quickly for not being stealthy. Finally, for a small little indie title about pixilated thieves, there is actually a pretty good story being told here. It presents itself as story's being told by one of the thieves in a police interview. As such, the 2nd story is the same heists, but completely changed around, and a step up in difficulty as it's another of the crooks recollection of the tale.It's up to you to puzzle out the whole truth of what really happened here. The reveal comes in the final mission of story two, but it's easy to miss what happened if you aren't expecting it.I continue to play this game and highly recommend it for the price it is now (15$, and certainly recommend it on sale)			",156,34,0,22,12,2,14

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of my favorite games. I just want to start with that. I got this game a couple months ago and I'm hooked. Yeah, it's a little frustrating at times, but only in that sort of ""Aargh I'm not quite good enough for this level!"" way.Monaco is kind of a fun time-waster singleplayer, but where it really shines is multiplayer. It is FANTASTIC, and not just for the sake of completion. It's so much fun to run through the levels, causing chaos, or try to not get spotted at all. Make sure you discuss your plans with other players, but don't be surprised when things fall apart because of an unlucky corner with five guards behind it.The way powers help your friends makes the teamwork element of this game happen so naturally you might not even realize you're doing it at first. The hacker runs through a hallway trailing viruses, and the laser grid in your way just dies. The Mole digs a tunnel, and you escape through it to a nearby shrub. And everyone loves a Lookout. If there's one character who doesn't play well with teams, it's the Pickpocket, whose power is purely self-focused and who tends to hoard all the coins. If everyone's okay with that, by all means, play him. But if you're just browsing for random games online, it's polite to not use the pickpocket.The difficulty wobbles a bit around the start of the second act, but it pretty much goes steadily up from there. And keeps going up. This works to the game's advantage. The difficulty curve gives you enough time to get used to the system, and then slowly works in new elements and characters, and by the time you're dealing with the really hard stuff, you've got at least an idea of what to do. You may not be able to do it on your first try, or even your first ten, but you should be able to understand at least the theory of how the pieces fit together.Replay value? The game has incredible replay value. Not only are there eight characters to play through with, but there's an entire community of fan-made maps to play, and once you've done all the main story, there's even a zombie mode for more violent fun! I've already beaten the main story, and I'm working my way through the stunningly difficult final campain, ""Fin"". I am curious how they might expand the story that I thought was over, but it seems to be a well-written wrap-up.The story is simple, but has a few twists to make it more satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I will say that I would have been satisfied with the game if it had concluded with ""Identity"". The two (much shorter) extra acts were icing on the cake. It's a pretty standard heist plot, with a little bit of ""how we got here"" thrown in, betrayals, and other standard tropes of the genre, but it managed to surprise me in places, which made me very happy. It's not often you get to play a mystery from the villain's perspective and still be surprised.If I'm ambivalent about only one aspect, it would be the artstyle. The sprites are charming, but it's really quite difficut to tell who's who at times, and for colorblind players, this would be completely incomprehensible. Everyone looks like squares, including the enemies. The top-down angle limits the perspective, but the backgrounds do not suffer from the same confusion as the characters. They are gorgeous, elaborate, and the way lighting is used is something I've never seen in another stealth game. In some of the levels, I can even look down through the floor to see bits of the lower areas. The music is amazing, but since the levels can be a bit long, it loops a lot. It's by no means grating, and it spreads the clips out with slow, quiet periods, so it doesn't get stuck in your head too often, but it could have used a little variety. I loved the musical cues for when someone got spotted or an objective was completed, though.All in all, a fantastic game, and one that I'd readily recommend to anyone who likes stealth games, co-op games, or mysteries.Singleplayer: 3/5. A little tedious, but fun and challenging.Multiplayer: 5/5. The game's strongest point. One of the best co-op experiences I've ever had.Art: 3/5. The sprites were limited, but the settings were gorgeous.Sound: 4/5. The music was excellent, and I wish there had been more variety to it. The voices of the characters were delightful, even if I couldn't understand a word of french.Difficulty: 4/5. Quite a challenge, but not so difficult you become disenchanted. You learn and get better noticably over time.Replay: 5/5. Many levels, community-made maps, and excellent multiplayer. The end is just the beginning.			",121,34,0,18,2,2,4

												Monaco was an interesting concept and was alright for awhile. The problem is, the game provides a co-op function which it then, through its very design, discourages you from using. There is no way to make any permanent progress on any given level. Any deterrent you use to reduce the number of potential threats (even shooting the guards or exploding them) can be reversed by other guards, and murdering everyone on every map is impractical, if not impossible. This means that ultimately, the best way to beat any map is to remain undetected, but remaining undetected is infinitely easier when playing alone, as cooperative matches often just turn into a smash-and-grab chaotic cluster♥♥♥♥.  At the same time, playing the game alone is almost pathetically easy, and feels hollow. In either case, the concept felt a bit unpolished and there was never a sense, at least not for me, that careful planning and slow, steady progress on a level would reward a player (or group of players) with a superior playing experience, so every level just devolved into ""Grab what you can, die in a bush, and hope someone survives to revive you.""Suffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game).Had some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though.			",107,33,0,51,8,1,26

												A simple 'yes' for a recommendation doesn't seem powerful enough for what is, truly, one of the finest experiences of gameplay I've ever seen.Take 1 part heist movie, 1 part crayloa 64-count crayon box, 1 part mad magazine, and 1 part jaw-droppingly gorgeous soundtrack, and you being to get an idea of what the game is. You're a thief - and your job is to Pokemon the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone elses valuables in the city of Monaco. Want to break into rooms quicker? Locksmith. Want to see everything at all times? Lookout. Want to....clean? The Cleaner. This game takes every single heist movie trope, turns it on it's ear, and then wraps it up in the most simple but polished beyond measure gameplay you're likely to find on any platform.Oh, and that's just single player.Multiplayer is even better. You REALLY learn about how your friends that you always planned that incredible heist with would react in that situation, because guess what? Neither one of you think alike, and you're going to be tripping alarms and getting shot by security guards left and right. The best part of this game, however, is Austin Wintory's score. It's simply gorgeous, and makes an already great game my 2014 game of the year.			",115,42,1,19,7,3,17

												This review prepares one mentally for Monaco's negative points. It is a great stealth game which I highly recommend but these are some things which you should know before purchasing. I can sing the praises for this game in the voice of a singing skald but that defeats the purpose of a review.-----------------------GraphicsIt is confusing distinguishing what the icons on the map symbolize and the lighting looks like a complete mess. It takes quite awhile (at least 5 hours) just getting fully accustomed to the visuals of the game.DifficultyThe game has a very gentle learning curve that only gets hard toward the end of the second campaign. This can be a problem for some players as there are a lot of hidden mechanics which isn't taught anywhere and you have to figure these things out on your own.For other players, the first half game is extremely easy just brute forcing your way through. Don't be too hasty in shrugging off the game as the difficulty ramps up towards the latter half. There are countless challenging workshop maps too.WorkshopThere are over a hundred good custom maps available in the workshop (if you know where to look), this is the reason the game has a tonne of content for hours of fun. While the editor is great and easy to pick up, the lack of players will mean anything you make is left for dead.Anti-social Hosts (Aka. Why you should not get Monaco)The 'community' is pretty dead and newer players have a tendency to kick strangers out of a lobby even if there are vacancies. Unfortunately, most hosts are unbothered to have these games in private. If you do get the game, it is best to at least have a friend or two to join you. Chaos in a party is what makes Monaco great. There will be more players during the summer sale so grab the game then.Colour-blindnessColour-blind mode doesn't help much and it's a game where colours are used to differentiate things easily. :P-----------------------TL:DRGrab the game if it's on sale, it's a steal stealing stealers stealing money like a monkey, with a monkey.

												Beware people with colorblindness such as myself, when you are playing co-op with others, it almost impossible to tell which character you are playing as, causing many frustrations when you think you are controlling your character but instead trying to control someone else's and the colorblindness mode does slim to nill to actually fix that problem.

												Monaco can be a nice game to casually solo but the real fun comes from running with accomplices. The more thieves racing through the map, getting beaten and shot, the crazier time you will have. Watch your friends die in horrible places, like the center of a heavily populated dance floor. Plan elaborate rescue missions to recover your friend's corpse from within a crowd of dancing NPCs. Get beat up by the guards as you struggle to recover your fallen comrade. Laugh at how miserably you failed.10/10			",161,38,1,22,14,1,18

												Monaco is an excrutiatingly difficult 4-player co-op fast-paced stealth game played from a top-down perspective with many unique characters to play as.While it starts simple, this game becomes progressively more complex and challenging, demanding your crew to have great spatial awareness, a lot of patience, wit, and most importantly, synchronization. Violence is only a countermeasure when there's no other way to solve a dangerous problem (like an alert) and supplies are very limited. Each crewmate can only hold one type of item and stocks of it are only generated by collecting many coins, forcing teams to prioritize coin collection to a certain individual depending on the item and the map being played.Overall, a very fun and addicting game, completely recommended.

												The level of sneakery in this game is fantastic. You can get through the entire game without being seen, but even if you do get spotted, it's still entertaining running around, ducking into AC vents and evading the security guards. The best part of the gameplay is its simplicity. You have one item, and the character you choose has one special ability. The difficulty curve is actually really well-made. You start in levels with just a handful of guards, and eventually reach sprawling levels with lots of automated security systems and attack dogs and stuff. Amazingly, it works as both a singleplayer and multiplayer experience. It's a lot better in multiplayer, because four people running around knocking people out, setting off alarms, and planting C4 is better than one. But it can stand on its single player experience. There's a level editor and the developers have released a few new content packs for free, so that's pretty cool. If you like heist games and general stealthy sneaky hiding-in-bushes and running around stealing stuff, this game is definitely for you.			",108,15,0,11,17,2,15

												Now, this game is VERY, VERY underrated for no reason. Monaco: What's your's is mine is a game for 1-4 players that put players into the roles of french heisters. Player can choose between 8 characters: Locksmith, Cleaner, Pickpocket, Lookout, Redhead, Mole, Gentleman and Hacker. Each character has it's own abilites, for example, Gentleman can disguise and he is practicly invisible to enemies for some time. Game has a lot levels, and even if you pass them all, you can still download some from workshop, or even make your own (like I did)! Making your own levels is a little hard in the beggining, but believe me, it becomes MUCH easierafter 4-5 minutes. It is a lot of fun to make some joke maps and try to pass impossible maps. Game is best played with your friends or online with other people. Now, we came to the problem of the game. It has dead community. Really, if you try to find a multiplayer match, you will most likely end up disappointed. This game has fallen to this level that people doesn't even know what game are you talking about just because of the dead community. As I said, this game HAS to be filled with players, because it deserves at least that much. Please, all of you, buy this game and help this game rise to the place where it belongs.Game is absolute 10/10, would recommend to anyone.			",109,11,3,4,11,0,7

												Probably one of the best co-op (local or online) games out there. The stealth mechanics manage to fit well with the generally arcadey feel, as the guards aren't super perceptive, so they can be avoided if you're careful (and sometimes if you aren't!). Stealth playthroughs, especially in singleplayer, are satisfying and tense. However, Monaco is just as fun when you don't try to be stealthy, as you can get into crazy and action-filled situations as you're forced to escape oncoming guards after you trip an alarm or get caught. The AI can be punishing, though, and some enemies, such as shotgun toting Gendarme, are not to be taken lightly. Multiplayer tends to lean towards the more wild approach unless you're working in a two-man crew or everyone is trying to stay on the down-low. You're given the pick of (once you unlock all of them) eight thieves, each with their own unique abilities, all of which are useful. This is another reason why the game shines in multiplayer, because each thief can tackle different situations that others would have trouble with. There's also a good number of equipments which provide the player with some tool that can get help them get the job done, like smoke bombs, shotguns, C4, and EMPs. Monaco has a ton of standard campaign levels with unique settings and good variety, and there's also hundreds of user-made levels, some of which are almost as good as the standard ones. The level editor itself is fairly easy to use once you understand the basics, and there are a couple of really extensive guides on the community page which can help get you started. It's also got a sweet noir style piano soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy who made the Journey soundtrack.Now, all of this comes with, as I see it, one major catch. Monaco is a really old game, as far as indie online co-op games go (it seems). There's a way smaller community base than there was a few years ago, so finding players can be a challenge. Because of this, I'd recommend that you find a friend willing to play with you, or try the local co-op. If neither of those work out for you, try and leave a message on the community board asking for players. From what I've seen, there are some people who would be willing to play.			",26,4,0,0,4,0,1

When Monaco is working — when two or more people are picking through its stages, evading traps, conking out guards, and breaking into dangerous territory, it clicks like an expensive safe. It nails the white-knuckled, Hollywood heist motif with style. But you're going to need like-minded friends — and a whole lot of patience — to get there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is unique. Strategy and cooperation at its best. Play alone to hone your ninja skills (without the need of flashy graphics or a third dimension) or play with friends where each one of you selects a different, often crucial, role in a heist. The gameplay is simple but adequate while the 8 playable characters offer completely different approaches to the same goal. You can run around take the objective and escape or you can take your time and clear out anything of value. The game's random factors allow replaying, which is always a pro in a game and in-game/steam achievements force you to try new things. The screenshots cannot convey the fact that while playing this game you have no need for more detailed graphics. Like chess what matters are the values of the players and their positions so don't judge it too fast.			",173,26,4,29,15,3,46

												A surprisingly complex game stems from a very simple goal: steal all the goods in the building and don't get caught. The presentation of the game is very well done, as every little detail in the visuals of the game makes sense in some terms of either the mechanics or the story of the game. The art style of the game is something new to almost anyone, and the co-op play in Monaco is some of the best there is in the Steam market. Community maps are also being made daily, so the replay value of this game is also top notch. Quite the hidden gem to be discovered by anyone who enjoys uniqueness and creativeness in both presentation and gameplay.			",130,14,1,10,13,1,12

												This is definitely one of the best indie games i've played in a long time.You play as one of several crooks -- all with their separate traits and abilities.You work together with other players to use each ability to your advantage and clean out a heist with style.The fog of war system is top notch and the game has minimal bugs.However, one bug in particular that is especially annoying to me is a bug where if you alt-tab when in full screen mode, you can't go back to the game. This is particularly annoying for me because I alt-tab a lot, but it can be fixed by playing in windowed mode.All in all, a great game. 10/10			",48,3,1,2,7,0,2

 Hours of multiplayer fun If you enjoy playing co-op games with friends, this is a must-have.Even the moments of frustration will bring you closer together.

												Hilarious game! great campaign mode - very deep - lots of opportunities to be creative with your heist - plan with friends.  Large levels with many features, laser alarms, sentry guns, guard dogs, pet cats, phone calls etc. Classes are varied and interesting, can be combined in many ways to form unique crews for different ideas on how to go about each heist. Even includes a fun PvP mode to compete with friends - where you steal trophies from the map and from the other players and attempt to flee the level. I expected this game to be fun - but i am so impressed by how much it exceeded my expectations. This is a very polished and well thought out game. If you have friends you game with regularly this is a fantastic game for you guys to enjoy. i highly recommend for those that want to have big laughs with friends over voice comms.

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a top down 2D heist game where you and 3 other optional players play as different characters with each having their own abilities over 2 main story acts and 2 supplement acts. The first two acts have a large amount of levels where the last two supplement acts only have a handful, however they are difficult. The game encourages team work as the later levels become incredibly difficult and requires lots of practice and runs. This is a perfect team game but also plays very differently solo and is still lots of fun hiding from enemies and trying to figure out the best paths to take or how best to utilize your character's ability in the level. The game is lots of fun and becomes hectic and fast paced when you trip an alarm and you're trying to run away from the enemies!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't finished playing it yet, but it's absolutely a fine single-player stealth game with lots of replayability that doesn't give any special advantages to one character like all those other co-op games do. Every character has their own two special advantages (except for the Redhead, whose second ability is crippled from a lack of other players), and you could complete the campaign from start to finish using any of them. So if the single-player is really good and stands up on its own from the co-op for once, why play co-op? Answer: Four players running around having their perfect plan ruined by a difficult or unexpected triviality, running from the guards and trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of there without screwing everything up further. This is hilarious, and when the players succeed, it's hilarious and a sight to behold. Also the sound and visual design are pitch perfect as well.			",452,99,7,53,31,2,53

												At first I thought this game was all smoke and mirrors when it came to the game play and graphics, but up until I took the time to actually play this game then I realized the potential it has playing yourself or playing online with others. The games premise is to rob places without being detected, which seems simple right? The unique portion is working together as each different player or unit has a specific function. There are 8 different classes to unlock while progressing through the game : the locksmith, the pickpocket, the cleaner, the lookout, the mole, the gentleman, the hacker, the redhead. In order, the locksmith can pick locks a lot faster than anyone, the pickpocket is able to acquire coins from a greater distance and doesn't alert guards or trigger alarms, the cleaner can knock out guards and heal faster, the lookout can see a vast majority of whats going on from great distances, the mole can rip through almost any wall (my favorite characteristic!), the gentleman is able to disguise himself, the hacker can disable alarms and spread viruses into computer systems and finally, the redhead who is able to attract enemies and have them open doors for her while not harming other immediate players. Some of these players come when you first start the game while others have to be unlocked as you progress (nothing wrong with that)! Map designs are also very fluid and challenging. Some parts will seem impossible to get by without a helping hand. There is usually always a way though if you're stuck playing solo.The unique view setting this game provides is the excitement through it's graphics. Although simple in premise, it's very effective in providing a good game play experience (unless you don't like this sort of thing and are bound to stylish 3D graphics). Sounds are absolutely fantastic and as a French speaking individual, it's greatly appreciated. I'm sure those who do not speak French will start picking up a few things as well. The dialogue is okay (I wish they added a bit more) but for the most part it does a good job keeping you on your toes.I would recommend buying it on sale.Indie Rating : 8/10RATING : 7.2/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots : My friend is hacking while I'm breaking down walls There are graphic indicators in game to show where your friends are (notice bottom left) Don't alert the guard don't alert the guard don't alert the guard If you're making holes in the wall, the guards can hear it ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Extremely satisfying heist game. It's not exactly a fully stealth game, getting found is not the end of the world, you just need to escape and hide. The gameplay alternates between  trying to be stealthy and purposefuly or mistakenly getting discovered while accomplishing some objective. The coop experience is vastly different than the solo experience. The ideal is to have a group of 4 friends and play together.			",71,21,1,6,6,0,14

												tl;dr: It's a top-down heist game about collecting shiny things. Maybe get it if you have friends to play with, and both of you are willing to spend a couple hours figuring out mechanics. What is Monaco? Monaco is a game where you control four (supposedly) elite thieves across a complex level in a quest to collect all shiny things. To make things fun, its levels also contains a lot of traps and guards. Some of them will shoot at you with bullets, while another will have explosives in order to try to kill you. In order to deal with that, you can use various items such as bullets and explosives to try to not die. Though you can just sneak past all of them if you just hold shift (but it's slow so only do it when you need to). At the end of the level, the game will look at your timer and add penalty for any shiny things you might've missed before putting you into a leaderboard. Uhm, supposedly? Monaco have this weird inclination to not teach you things you need to know. For example : In the upcoming steam sale, there will be many lobbies. However, most of them will kick you if you try to join because they actually want to play with their friends but they don't know how to make private lobby. There's also the fact that you won't know what's the key to toggle shared view unless you go to the option menu (it's E). Heck, even the stealth is not really explained. Your thief can move right in front of a guard's nose without alerting them or use an atm that is being camped by a guard, but you won't know how to unless you're willing to experiment for a while. Is the multiplayer alive? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I only play pub games roughly once a week, mostly because I rarely find a lobby during weekdays. Maybe you can randomly add people during steam sale? Is the singleplayer fun? Sure, most of my pub games is basically just me playing solo while occassionaly reviving others. The game doesn't have much replay value on solo play unless you're into speedrunning, but there's 40 levels that should keep you entertained for a while.			",104,19,0,17,8,1,16

												This game was quite a steal.What? No one on drums? Do I REALLY have to do this? Ugh, screw it. To the review!Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is an indie game released last year. It is stealth and puzzle based, with some action elements in it and a whole lot of teamwork. For the most part, I really enjoy the game. Seeing there's so much to say, I'll say it as best as I can, like I say in pretty much all of my reviews.We'll start off with, hmm... How about visuals. Y'know what they say, ""First is the worst, second is the best, third is the one with the (Treasure, hairy, etc) chest."" So, like that said, ""First is the worst."" Allthough, the graphics aren't all that bad. They just don't compare to the greatness of the rest of the game. It has the retro feel to it. Kinda stale, as lots of indie games do that, but I've seen worse.So, second is the best. I give the gameplay the ""2nd is the best"" award. The gameplay is so, open. You can choose your playstyles and take advantage of that with one of the eight classes to choose from. If you want to run around and knock people out so your teammates can get to the next floor or car, pick the Cleaner. If the place is heavily guarded with lasers and such, pick the Hacker. If you're too lazy to strategize and want to get to the next floor, choose the Mole. There are many secrets to discover, and some of them can actually be quite humorous. So yeah, you can explore the rooms to get all the loot, since there is no time limit. No, I'm not done yet. Did I mention that there was a LEVEL EDITOR? For you creative minds out there (like myself, no, seriously!) you will enjoy the level editor. It is very simple to use. After looking at a guide made by Andy Nguyen, the man that designed most of the levels in Monaco, I was able to learn how to add lasers and such. I discovered that unlike other difficult level editors *cough* Super Meat Boy *cough* I was able to create a level. The only other game that I can think of with a level editor that simple is LittleBigPlanet. If anything, Monaco's level editor is easier to use, and you're talking to an LBP fanboy. Okay, let's continue before I begin to talk about LBP...I'll go to the story next. Although there isn't much of a story, there are pre-dialogues before every mission, so you can get info on what's going on. I thought it was acceptable and a little surprising to see how well done it is. I have low expectations on story, unless it's a huge story based game. I think Monaco's story is interesting. Especially for the Lockpicker's story. But hey, there isn't much else to say.Now, for the audio. Not much to it. Okay, not much to it when talking about the AI. Okay. I take that back. There are lots of awesome sounds in this game. That's it. Fooled you! I didn't talk about the magnificent soundtrack. Monaco's songs are mostly piano songs, but when played in a game like this, it was done in an amazing way. It's not an ""Oh. My. God. Drooling! Drooling! Drooling! Drooling!"" soundtrack, not like Bastion's or FTL's anyway, but I enjoy it. Replayability time. Since I only have a couple hours into the game, I don't know much about replayability. However, I do know it does last you quite some time. You can try and get #1 on the All-Time list for the record times, or you could design more levels. It's up to you. What's funny is that these paragraphs are all small except for gameplay. Well, I'm doing my best to keep this not biased.Now, for the flaws. Don't worry, almost done! Despite Monaco's many, many pros, there are some pretty major flaws that need to be pointed out. Okay, to be honest, it's one major flaw. Ready? The AI in this game is HORRIBLE. And I do mean HORRIBLE. So, I climb up a ladder to hide from guards, but one climbs up, walks right through me, and climbs down without noticing me right IN FRONT OF HIM. Also, I ran away from another group of guards, not far away and still visible, I stay there and wait for the pursuing guards to catch me. What's the problem? Those lazy fatasses decided to go back to their post. There are countless more stories about how big of morons these guards are. Want me to tell you some more? No? That's what I thought. Let's finish this thing.In conclusion, Monaco is an amazing game. Fun, simple gameplay mechanics, neat soundtrack, a surprising story, and pretty impressive replayability, you'll definitely enjoy the game. One of the few gems from last year the I, personally, think should have gotten more praise, despite it already having a couple positive reviews. However, the moron AI makes the game a lot less difficult and lame. If you don't mind bad AI and stale graphics, then you're in for one enfer d'un tour, which means ""hell of a ride"" in French.

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, is another game that falls under the category of ""Not sure what to play? Well why not this?"". I will recommend this game to anyone, and say that it is a game that I should have picked up a lot earlier than I did. It is a fun and neat little indie game that can offer hours of gameplay once you get into it. It is very intuitive and can offer a challenge to almost anyone. I have only played it for about 4 hours, and in that time I only beat the first story-line (it was a very relaxed 4 hours, mind you). The game is very addictive once you start, and you will find more and more difficulty in the various levels as you go on.The biggest downside to this game is that it can be very hard to find a multiplayer game without at least one dumbass who can and will ruin it for others, but once you do find that one team, you can swoop through the entire game no problem in a short time.As for the crew, I found it fun to play more or less each of them, but I did find a few that I favorited over others, due to their playstyle, and I imagine most people will as well.

												The gameplay and story is essentially about 8 characters who are all criminals, looking to steal some stuff. The story is told in conversation snippets before each mission between characters. Visuals are pretty much demonstrated by the screenshots. Design and mechanics are simple, which I like though it may not be to everyone's taste. The characters only have one specific different skill and a hidden secondary skill that makes them all feel different, but not overly so. A nice surprise about the game for me was that I found out a year after owning Monaco that they had updated the maps, providing more/newer content for free with older maps remain playable. Though single player is good, the multiplayer is what makes it great. Maps get notoriously difficult at later stages and very difficult to beat without help. It can get frustrating, but clearing them also feels incredibly rewarding. Keep in mind however it's rare to see open/public lobbies (from what I've seen), so make sure you have friends to play with. Replay value is high when not going solo.I would recommend this game for most people, unless you are completely sure it is not your cup of tea. If it's on sale, it's definitely worth a purchase.

-Quick Review-Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine is a 2d stealth game that is played from the top view the whole time. The game is very random in puzzle nature so it’s difficult to plan for whatever you face in the game. You can play between several different campaigns and also play player-based maps.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The first campaign you are the Locksmith, tell the story of escaping from prison and trying to make it to a new country and leave his past of crime behind him. Unfortunately the temptation of getting additional wealth starts to pull him away from his initial intentions.Additional campaigns tell of a more elaborate story, the second campagn is about the Pickpocket, whom is narrating and telling a different story from the Locksmith. There are two more campagns but I haven’t played those yet, because of the increasing difficulty in the puzzles.(Where are my Ninja stars and places to sneak and hide?  //Goes back to Ninja games)Game Play: In Monaco you can choose between eight different characters, each with their own ability’s to help them get through the various puzzles. There are useful guides to help you understand more about what the characters do.To list the basic starting four characters: the locksmith can picklocks really fast, the Pickpocket has a pet monkey that collects loot, the cleaner knocks people out (when they don’t see him), the lookout can detect enemies that are farther away and out of your line of site.Achievements: The achievements in this game are rather straight forward, but also rather tough. As usual you get several achievements just from beating a few levels, but in the end most of the achievements will require a lot of work to earn. Most can be earned with guides on offline single player. But the rest will requirePrice: Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine costs $14.99, for me that is overpriced, but you could easily get many hours of gaming out of it. If you do get over 20 hours out of the game (and know you love stealth based games and a lot of challenge) it’s probably a fair price.I feel like it’s not fair for me to say that I don’t recommend the game because of the price, I just really didn’t enjoy the game, but it was a good game and I think it’s worth a try… try the free weekend or a demo or something before you purchase it to know for certain if you like this style of game. Conclusion: I really thought this game was interesting, different, unique, and added a great amount of challenge compared to most classical stealth games. But this game would be way more fun to play with friends. Even when I played a few games with strangers I enjoyed the fast paced gameplay.But I really can’t say this game makes it on my top list. I would recommend this game just because I think it deserves a chance, but once again; try it on a free weekend or a demo of some type before you purchase, so you know ahead of time what you’re getting yourself into.

												A splendid game to play with friends, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is a top-down game puzzle-ish co-op game with a simplistic but very pleasing art style. Now, when I say this game is a ""puzzle-ish co-op game"", I say that because it's not quite a puzzle game, as it has elements of action to it, but completing each mission can be seen as a ""puzzle"" of sorts. I'd say it's a stealth game, but it's not entirely that, either: while stealth can make things easier, blitzing through a room and drawing all eyes to you can work occasionally also. The goal of each level is to steal all trophies before exiting via the escape route, with an added side objective of collecting as many coins as you can to get a higher score. The main obstacles in the game are the guards, who, upon seeing you, chase you down and beat you senseless until you either escape their pursuit or die. When the latter happens, you can get revived by your buds, but doing so leaves you vulnerable for a decent amount of time, so caution is necessary. By default, you have no means of combat, leaving avoidance of threats as the best option. However, there are items that allow you to better deal with threats, like smoke bombs, sleeping darts, guns, and explosives (possibly others I may have missed), of which you can have one equipped at a time, and all of which are replenished by collecting the previously mentioned coins throughout the level. In addition to guards, there are other obstacles, though most of them just draw the attention of the guards so they can go about their merciless beatings of your team. To offer a wider array of methods to deal with the various things between you and your loot, the game has a character system in which each character has a special ability unique to them; there is a very nice diversity of character choice, with each character possibly opening up alternative routes to the objectives. For instance, the Hacker can hack into terminals and disable nearby electronics, such as cameras and laser sensors, the Cleaner can knock guards unconscious when behind them, and the Mole can break through (some) walls. The game is certainly a lot less interesting and enjoyable when playing alone, as it's meant to be a co-op game first and foremost. It has a story mode, and I have no strong feelings regarding the story either way, but the levels are very well-done, generally. The game has a built-in level editor and thus aptly is tied to the Steam Workshop, so when you're finished with the campaign, there are plenty of community levels to peruse as well, a fair amount of which are bound to be substantial and enjoyable.In short, fantastic little co-op game that's fun, interesting, and worthwhile. I had a blast playing it, and it's probably one of my favorite little indie games (and by ""indie"", I mean the real definition of indie—that is, self-published and independent of any larger company; sorry, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of that term is killing me) of all time, simply based on how much of a good time I had with it.

												In 2014 an awkward group of Skullgirls players decided to play something else for a change. These nerds promptly went to their games tab and downloaded Monaco. Today, still being terrible at this game, they survive as scrubs of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can voip them, maybe you can hire: The S-Team.

												Kind of like a stealth-oriented Hotline Miami, the name of the game in Monaco is to get in, steal an objective, get out, while taking all the dosh along the way. Unlike most stealth games though, Monaco expects you to be caught, and gives you tools to deal with a situation. That's not to say finesse isn't important, since you have to earn additional gear usage.The characters have different abilities and each one has a different way of handling the same level, giving great replayability.Single-player and multi-player also have very different methods of approach.Like all good games, it starts off simple but becomes quite challenging in the end. Getting all of the gold in a level unlocks mirrored, more difficult versions of the levels.The music is a smooth ragtime piano that changes to fit the action. Haven't heard anything like it in other games.Comes with a level editor, and the hours of additional play that entails.I had a ton of fun with this game and I think you will too.

												★★★★★Director Andy Schatz realizes his vision of creating a Slapstick comedy disguised as a David Mamet thriller. Follow the mishaps of a bumbling crew trying to hit it big on the French Riviera. An all star cast includes George Clooney (The Gentleman), Christina Hendricks (The Redhead), John Leguizamo (The Hacker) and Randy Savage (The Cleaner) with many more surprise guests! A multi-layered narrative cleverly unravels the intrigue behind the group as it builds and performs daring heists. Monaco: What's Yours is Mine gives thrill seekers the intense highs and lows they've come to love from their favorite heist movies while appealing to those outside the genre with its lightheartedness. Grab three friends and enjoy seeing the world through the eyes of the four stooges trying to reinact the Zoolander Computer scene. Team Chuckle♥♥♥♥ approved.

Serves up challenging, highly-emergent stealth puzzles that remain fresh and fun even when you've just failed for the umpteenth time. Solo play is downright drab compared to the amazing co-op, but I guess that's the price to pay for this truly one-of-a-kind multiplayer experience.			",272,143,16,34,23,3,38

												Fantastic way to practice your high school French. Qui va là? It's a decent single player game*, but the co-op play is great! Best played with people in the same room or at least with free-flowing voice chat. Works fine as a two-player game, but some levels would have been much easier with 3-4 people.Level design is brilliant and almost perfectly calibrated to increase the difficulty as you go. Except for Pearls Before Swine, that level was a ♥♥♥♥♥ and much harder then it needed to be. Not that I'm bitter about spending a week of evenings on a single level or anything. :) I didn't realize how awesome the levels were until I tried some of the featured / highly rated workshop levels. Most of those aren't worth the time yet. Maybe in time as people get better at designing...The storyline was actually interesting. I'm usually a ""mash the button to skip past all these stupid words"" type, but not this time. Very well done.It does have a few annoying aspects:- If your connection to Steam drops, you'll get booted from the game. You can't reconnect to a game. - The menu interface is stupid. Good luck trying to exit the game and managing to hit the right combination of Space and Esc without reading the options every time. If you prefer to play on LAN instead of over Steam, you'll have to set that every.single.time even though it seems to remember all the other settings just fine. - The outlet/coin spawns are randomly generated, so sometimes you may want to restart a level if your team has a hacker and the outlet placement sucks.* My spouse has been speedrunning levels for weeks now, so it's also a great single player game if leaderboards and completionism are your thing. I think he's nuts. :) ",48,15,0,7,28,0,14

 Monaco is a steal at this priceNot going to go into much detail right now but this game is brilliant. Lovely and fairly unique art style with gameplay and story that manages to both fit in perfectly with the visuals and give it a lot of charm. There's a wide range of characters you an play as with each one having their own unique traits and/or abilities that compliment the level design perfectly. Each gives you an entirely different approach to how you move throughout the levels.In co-op play, only one player can play each character so you have to work out what's best (or the most fun) for the situation and who's playing what. The different characters have great synergy with one another and allow you pull off much more complicated and efficient strategies. This can also lead to the most hectic games you'll see with one mistake causing sheer chaos. Though the single player is great and doesn't suffer from solo play, the co-op is the life of this game and it's where the most replay value will be had.Classic mode allows you to play as originally intended if you don't want to play with the changes in updates and zombie mode makes everything much more dangerous with much more persistent enemies. If you run out of levels to play then there's a level editor and Steam Workshop support to keep the game lasting as long as you want.I've only got 2.5 hours of this game on Steam but I purchased this game for the Xbox 360 on release and I've very much enjoyed what I've played. There's a lot more content in the Steam version, it is 100% the better version of the game and it's worth the full price without a doubt.Grab this game while it's 87% off if you don't own it already. The discount is for both a single copy and the 4 pack. It's a steal at this price and you'll be missing out big time if you don't pick it up.			",559,150,13,61,32,6,71

												Fantastic way to practice your high school French. Qui va là? It's a decent single player game*, but the co-op play is great! Best played with people in the same room or at least with free-flowing voice chat. Works fine as a two-player game, but some levels would have been much easier with 3-4 people.Level design is brilliant and almost perfectly calibrated to increase the difficulty as you go. Except for Pearls Before Swine, that level was a ♥♥♥♥♥ and much harder then it needed to be. Not that I'm bitter about spending a week of evenings on a single level or anything. :) I didn't realize how awesome the levels were until I tried some of the featured / highly rated workshop levels. Most of those aren't worth the time yet. Maybe in time as people get better at designing...The storyline was actually interesting. I'm usually a ""mash the button to skip past all these stupid words"" type, but not this time. Very well done.It does have a few annoying aspects:- If your connection to Steam drops, you'll get booted from the game. You can't reconnect to a game. - The menu interface is stupid. Good luck trying to exit the game and managing to hit the right combination of Space and Esc without reading the options every time. If you prefer to play on LAN instead of over Steam, you'll have to set that every.single.time even though it seems to remember all the other settings just fine. - The outlet/coin spawns are randomly generated, so sometimes you may want to restart a level if your team has a hacker and the outlet placement sucks.* My spouse has been speedrunning levels for weeks now, so it's also a great single player game if leaderboards and completionism are your thing. I think he's nuts. :) ",48,15,0,7,28,0,14

												Bottom line, this is Ocean's Eleven: The Game. And that is a hefty recommendation all by itself.Up to four players choose one of 8 crooks, each with a unique specialty. The Locksmith opens doors and safes quickly, the Cleaner neutralizes people when they're not looking. Then the team must work together to pull off heist objectives, or, more challenging, get every available coin.The action takes place in a top-down view. Layered systems of security, from dogs and motion sensitive cameras to civilians that alert nearby guards, must be bypassed or defeated to get in, get rich, and get out.The control scheme is marvelously compact. There is a sneak button and a use-special-item button. There is a button to bring up the HUD and see how much life you have and how many coins remain to be stolen in a level. There is a button for push-to-talk. And there is a control stick. If you want to do something, like unlock a door or hack into a computer, just walk into it.Online co-op feels magical. Even with strangers, you start to move as a team and think together. And if you don't, hilarity ensues as your careful plans go to pot. Can't omit the thoughtful graphics and sound design, but the core gameplay is the meat. It is new, and it is fabulous.A promised map editor will provide endless community content, to be released soon.In short, a must buy that may define 2013.			",142,73,1,29,33,2,31

												Wow wow wow!  Another very strong Indie game this year that is a must-buy!  At its core, it KIND of feels like a really complex Pac-man.  Takes a little while to figure out all of the mechanics and interpret the icons.  There really is a lot of information thrown at you right away.  Once you get used to the flow of gameplay, it is highly rewarding and makes you feel skilled at the profession you start developing an inclination towards. The variety of characters, the catchy ragtime-like piano music, and fast paced stealth action will get you really into this game!  Grab some friends and steal some stuff in Monaco!

												Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is, quite simply put, one of the most intelligent games released this year. The tightly structured gameplay is fast and fluid, and the colorful cast (quite literally) of playable characters are great. Everything about the game, from its mechanics to its presentation, to its music and its sound, feels original and fresh. Monaco is a game with a strong sense of self, a game that is acutely aware of its own eccentric identity and not afraid to show it, which is precisely what makes it such a strong title.In much the same fashion as Hotline Miami and Fez, the incredible art design shows just how much detail there can be in blocky, pixellated graphics. The music is nothing short of masterful, wearing its ragtime, silent-movie inspiration on its sleeve and being all the better for it. The sound design is phenomenal as well, with the typing of keys on a computer, to the whine and sharp snap of a breaker box, to the strange rumbling murmurs of a revive all contributing to the game's singular and unique personality.The game proves how millions of dollars aren't necessary in creating something fun and original; on the contrary, Monaco is important because it shows how so much can be done with so little. It shows the world that what a game really needs in order to stand out is an identity, something that many mainstream contemporary titles sorely lack. Thanks to the uniqueness and originality that pervades through every aspect of its construction, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is one of the best, and one of the most important, games released in recent memory. Buy it now if you haven't already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It takes a while to get used to, but Monaco is a fun and entertaining game. I'm not much on stealth ganes, but this one tells a good story, the mechanics are simple enough to learn, the characters are nicely done, and the music (piano) is fantastic.So I kept at it, began to understand what to do (not much explanation or tutorial in the game), and got myself hooked on the variety and style of gameplay. Time went by very quickly once the basics were learned. And the options available give you a lot of decisions to make.This one draws you in with initial simplicity, then steps up the challenge at just the right pace. It's fun, it's different, and I would recommend at least giving it a try. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is basically crazy fun. You and up to 3 other friends plan a heist to rob banks, buildings, passports all to escape the country. Despite what you might think, the story is fairly well thought out. The gameplay is top notch, with one catch. In the top down view, the mechanics still work on line of sight. So you might be walking round a corner into the room of heavily armored goons. This catch makes for many historical and hilarious Friday night playthroughs of this game as you will be playing this game for hours on end. I recommend this to anyone who love a good thrill and want to try something different.			",95,4,0,2,4,0,6

												One of the few Indie games that I can say I enjoyed. Monaco is the perfect mix of Hotline Miami, and Payday. With a simple design, usual heist game plot, this game is easy to grasp, suitable for gamers and non-gamers alike.However, this game has it's fair share of problems. The new October update, is dissapointing. The Origin campaign, whilst giving more info on the characters, feels like the same mission every time. I feel... more cheated out of a good promise, rather than dissapointed. The ""Zonaco"" zombie mode, is, well the same campaign. Only with zombies. So no round based, team oriented survival mode, like I hoped for. Saves us the screamers online, I suppose. + Story is well written, despite it's repetative missions+ Co-Op is tackled well, but the campaign can be played regardless without a partner+ Replayability. I have barely taken a chunk out of this game.+ Story is split into 2 Acts.- The October update. - It's easy to find the quick way around a mission, however the game tackles punishment well.7/10. A fun, well made Indie game.  ",113,22,4,15,5,1,5

I bought the game a while back since a friend of mine had it, we played the first couple of levels and all was well. Then, we stopped for a while, after which I cam back multiple diffrent times to try again. Only recently have I mangaged to progress past the ""Quarter Diamant"" heist.

												A lot of people seem to be of the opinion that Monaco is only fun when played in Co-Op, and while it's true that the game is at its best in those kinds of frantic multiplayer games, I honestly think the single player version shines just as much-- it just feels like a totally different game. Whereas co-op in Monaco is all about laying out plans and watching them go horribly wrong --and the frantic, off-the-cuff attempts to coordinate efforts to salvage the heist-- in single player, its a slower, more calculated and tactical game, where your lone-wolf status makes heists incredibly tense. The heightened difficulty of launching these heists solo is undercut by the fact that you have multiple lives-- you can play as every member of the team in solo, which allows for players to die in an often advantageous way by allowing one's self to switch characters--  but it still brings a unique challenge to each of the masterfully designed levels. Throw in a killer piano soundtrack that lands somewhere between ragtime and vaudeville, an enjoyably executed (if slight) story that uses unreliable narration for clever effect, and a robust map-maker tool with countless community maps (to say nothing of the recently added 'zombie' mode, a word that normally makes me cringe due to the cultural oversaturation of zombies, but nonetheless makes for an enjoyable variation on the standard gameplay), and you have the most fun multiplayer game of the year.At the time I'm writing this, Monaco is $2.99 on a flash sale. I got it for 7.50, and I would've paid full price for it if I realized it would be this fun.			",220,52,4,15,19,3,27

												Monaco is a rare must-have masterpiece that is beautifully crafted by Pocketwatch Games. The game follows the story of 8 crooks utilizing their unique assets and their assortment of weapons as they take back what is theirs. Monaco takes the player on a top down adventure and the path taken, a decision best left to your crooked ways. The art style and soundtrack lend to the game's exceptional theme and sense of class. Choose between single player or cross-platform multiplayer and play on a variety of campaign maps or challenge yourself with user created custom maps from the Steam Workshop. Worthy of note are the several major content updates that were free of charge. In an era where developers nickle and dime their fans, Pocketwatch Games is doing something right. I only wish that they would consider a sequel. Your Steam library may never be complete without this game.			",484,91,22,28,26,6,29

												Monaco. As I sit here in my palatial library, peering through my grimoire and other works, I note that I have not extended the pleasure of a review to the unwashed masses. Substantial evidence points to varying activities which have kept me from this world of opinion and unsubstantiated claim and counter-claim but now I return from the dead. Does it matter that Monaco, written by Neil Patrick Harris & Sylvester Stallone, has come out? Is this what has brought about my sudden return from pseudo-retirement? In all likelyhood, it is not. Monaco follows the journey of a band of thieves and crooks through the eponymous city of Monaco, Kentucky. Eugene Onion (Dwayne Johnson) is joined by Ribroast Jones (Ben Kingsley), Shia McBoof (Michael Sheen) and Michael ""Canned"" Meet (Daniel Day Lewis). The band makes their way from heist to heist never stopping to ponder the ""why"" or ""how"" of the entire situation. The Mise-en-scène denotes a chaotic and bizarre existance, punctuated extravagantly through the performance of Whoopi Goldberg as Goldberg.Who's to say whether or not this follow up to the 1923 movie, ""The Man with a Hat on his Head"" will take off, all I can say is that this is a whole new direction for Marvel to take the Batman franchise in.

												Alone, with your friends or even with random people, this is a game you must play! Monaco was by far one of the best experencias i had this year related to videogames - counitng only to what was relesed this year -. Almost everthing is perfect on this game, from the visuals, OST and the COOP. COOP on this game is the cherry on top of the cake. Monaco has some diversity missions such as, heist, saving someone or get alive from some place. Also contains 3 game modes; Enhanced, Classic and Zombies. Enhanced is shorter, more streamlined maps and will make a better and easy experience. Classic mode that is purist, hard to say. Now to class, some to choose and they are all great. Going to give some examples, The Cleaner, he can put enemies to sleep, is really hand when you find a room full of them. The Mole, funny character to use, he can breaks for almost any room really good to dig shortcut's. I think you got the point that character in Monaco are fun and useful to use. If you ever get bored of doing COOP and SP you have two options; PVP and creation mode. PVP is here you against another player ""fight"" to see who stole the intel first and can escape alive. Very fun game type. The creation mode is here you can make your own levels, case you have a nice imagination you may get feature in Monaco weekly/month workshop levels. Another thing i love in games and i especially love this on in Monaco is the OST, is brilliant, this gentleman Austin Wintory[austinwintory.bandcamp.com] made an awesome job here. The OST is so calm and fits very well in this game. - I advise you hear the full ost on that site - Now that you read my shout review, go buy this game and enjoy it! Totally worth your money! ~ 8/10			",493,181,16,44,79,10,49

												The game looks simple at first glance due to its artwork and design. But honestly, it very challenging once you  play it. This game shows that indie games aren't sucks, as a matter of fact most of the time they are the ones that make compelling games even if it looks cheap graphically, financially. Anyhow, I will definitely recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun and addictive game.What you do in here, is, 'robbing'.I love the part where I am a hacker and I can shut down computers and power sources. Cause that is super realistic.Time by time, when you play the game, you unlock characters. Every one of them, has a special abillity.For example:-Lockpicker= He can unlock things very quickly.-The cleaner= He can hit enemies-The Mole= He can crush through wallsAnd many more...So far I played like.. 1-2 hours or less, and I liked the game from the start.Here are the things WHY is this game awesome:-Good Graphics-Awesome Gameplay-Good Physics [movement, actions]-Sounds [Example: When you use a computer, it makes a sound of: ''Writing or typing, on a keyboard''-Addictive Storyline/Gameplay-You can hide in bushes and trees! Lmfao-Great characters-Extermely FunBad things about this game:-None.-Just If you don't like pixely and robbing games.. this isn't for you xDDIt's worth buying, doe I didn't buy, I got it as a gift, But BUY UNTIL THE DAILY DEAL LASTS!!!!!!!! ITS WORTH IT!			",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												Monaco... a game I got and played with friends ages ago but didn't enjoy as much as I wish I could. As much as I thought I'd enjoy it on the outset I found the content of the game itself rather... disappointing. Let me tell you a tale:You watch the trailers, you see the tags (Like ""Stealth"", and ""Heist""), and screenshots and you think to yourself, rightly so - ""ah, this is a stealth game"". You then buy the game, and as you start making your way through the game, solo or with friends, you find that that there are various mechanics that help you sneak past guards and such, and overall the ideas presented from those scenarios and abilities allow for unique ways of approaching your stealth. Then you and your friends notice the leader boards for levels... and see that the top scores... somehow managed to do it in seconds?Here is the problem: You are given all these tools, all these characters with unique designs and abilities, which altogether help to make an interesting apporach to a stealth heist. However, you then realise the following - it is much easy, efficient, and high scoring to simply run through the entire level, alerting everything as you do so, completing the objective and collecting coins and just escaping. Put simply - you are given lots of tools, but none of them are more efficient than just blitzing your way through the level.Hence, the reason why I didn't enjoy it was because it was misleading, not to say that blitzing your way through isn't fun, I kind of enjoyed it, for a while anyway. However I came to and bought this game with the intention of a stealth game. Maybe if the game atleast sort of told you that this was another way to approach then maybe it would've been fine, but with such misleading trailers and unfortunately, good and unique mechanics that are overshadowed by simply running all over the place, makes me glad I was able to refund this game.

												It's impossible to figure out how to play this game with local co-op, which was the main way they advertised this game to be played.  Super disappointed.  The developers really need to interact with other people at some point to realize the shortcomings of their own interfaces.  Go out and meet people.  Your menu system is the worst one I've seen in... well... ever.			",143,21,6,15,13,1,16

												A cracking game.A top-down heist 'em up with old-skool graphics. It might not look the part (though I find the graphics charming) but it more than makes up for it with fiendish level design and fun.The plot might be difficult to follow at times but the payoff is well worth it.Absolutely recommended as a co-op experience where it varies between good teamwork with flawless execution of plans and full on panic mode if one of the guards stumbles across your operation...Special mention to the characters and some of their abilities to basically rewrite some subtle game rules.

												It takes less than 1 map to realize Monaco is a unique indie/strat/action/stealth game lol seriously, monaco may not look flashy or may even make you look away due to its graphics and artwork, but dont be fooled! Monaco is creative, its entertaining, will make you think about your move, will let you pick what class better suits your playstyle and immeadiatly you will understand why it looks the way it does...Like Home, frozen synapse and FTL, Monaco, shows unique features while keeping the indie characteristics we love.It is the simpler yet still awesome version of payday. Different classes, cleaning up banks etc. You can play it online or in lan or alone. Definetly recommend it, not only to indie fans, but to stealth top view fans or strat game fans. Its a simple challenging and rewarding game,  where fun can be extracted within seconds of opening it.			",146,22,2,25,13,1,34

Another can ""charm"" her way into tricking one enemy to help with opening doors, etc. Another can break through walls (great for bypassing doors that are locked, especially double locked doors). Another can hack security systems and outlets to open doors and stuff.At first it looks like a crappy little 2d top view game, but once you get into it, it's much more than that.			",73,3,1,1,5,1,2

												This game is great- it's not too simple, not too complicated- the stories are pretty hilarious, and there's just enough humor to balance what could be potentially frustrating challenges..There's also a built in editor so you can make your own levels! Tons of fun to play with friends- especially in zombie mode!!I can't say enough about it- I hope they keep making new stories! Try it- chances are good that you'll love it :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary: Heist simulator 2013Multiplayer: 4Completion: 5 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesWhen you were a kid, were you ever dragged to a social gathering and had nothing fun to do there? Monaco is the game I wish I had when I was growing up and taken to play party games with other people.In Monaco you assemble a team of specialized thieves intent on stealing goods and getting away with it. You have very limited tools to handle opposition, so you must stealth your way to the goods, grab it, and run like hell. It's pretty much as it sounds.The graphics have a rather simplistic look. They're serviceable, though the saturated palette can make it hard to see things, and is sometimes hard on the eyes. Music is also serviceable. It goes for a sort of ragtime feel, like watching a black and white film.Gameplay involves a top-down view of the area, much like looking at a blueprint, with security guards whose attention span could give MGS Genome Soldiers a run for their money. Electronic traps and security cameras also seek to alert your presence, but you can disable these should you find their terminal.If there's one thing Monaco does well, its promote teamwork. The character roles are so different and specialized that the more people you have the better your chances are of pulling this off... provided you work together.If there's one thing I would like to add to the game, it's having AI party members. I can't always get a party of four, and so I would like to have some meatshiel- I mean scapegoa- I mean accomplices to assist me in my solo capers.While Monaco isn't the kind of game I would replay for days on end, it does make a fantastic occasional party game. Sure beats playing most board games. I give Monaco a 7.5/10 Thanks spleeno!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It takes less than 1 map to realize Monaco is a unique indie/strat/action/stealth game lol seriously, monaco may not look flashy or may even make you look away due to its graphics and artwork, but dont be fooled! Monaco is creative, its entertaining, will make you think about your move, will let you pick what class better suits your playstyle and immeadiatly you will understand why it looks the way it does...Like Home, frozen synapse and FTL, Monaco, shows unique features while keeping the indie characteristics we love.It is the simpler yet still awesome version of payday. Different classes, cleaning up banks etc. You can play it online or in lan or alone. Definetly recommend it, not only to indie fans, but to stealth top view fans or strat game fans. Its a simple challenging and rewarding game,  where fun can be extracted within seconds of opening it.			",146,22,2,25,13,1,34

												This is a great multiplayer game up to 4 players, each character has a specific skill, and they need to work together to beat each level.Levels are like heists, you get in, get the valuables and get out.The graphics are retro style, in good taste and with gameplay functions in mind.The music is very good, and it draws inspiration from old piano music composed for black and white mute movies.The gameplay is where it's at, it is a lot of fun to play multiplayer with friends, public games are also fun if you are lucky and meet cool people.Playing solo is also fun but a lot harder, the game then becomes more stealthy.You can also pick up and use items like guns, bombs and tranquilizers that you may use if you're not feeling particularly stealthy, thus playing the game more like an action game.In fact you even have a bonus (unlocked from the start) Zombie mode where you are encouraged to kill the enemies.The story, while not the main attraction, will keep you entertained (should you choose to read it, since you can skip it), it contains humour and a few unexpected twists and turns.There's a lot of content, and it'll take you a while to beat it all (some of the later levels are quite hard).I recommend.

												Fun top-down heist adventures. It's great as a stealth game when you're playing it single player, but the game is at its apex in multiplayer, when the various classes are able to combine their efforts to maximize progress. The art style is very stylized, so be vigilant of your character to prevent losing yourself in the map. All I could ask for is a sequel sometime soon..and maybe a more violent class than Cleaner. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There aren't many servers out there but it shouldn't be a problem if you play with friends. It requires coordination with your team mates since punishment can be dealt out of spite because of one player. Overall, I think it's a game that pushes you to be versatile in many situation since a veteran has the same risk of dying as a new player. It's a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an amazing game that you can play together with friends, and I've had lots of crazy antics playing in this game with my friends. You can just go absolutely nuts playing this together with friends, with a load of maniacal things happening, even if you're just screwing around or playing the normal story mode! The variety of characters you can play as are incredibly fun to play with The Gentleman if you want to be stealthy, The Pickpocket if you just want to hoard money, The Hacker for taking out security systems, The Mole for taking those irritating walls(who needs walls anyway? :D), The Lockpick for quick break-ins, The Lookout for a better view of what you're up against, The Redhead for getting those random cops to fall for you, and The Cleaner for silent knockouts... It's a great game, and you just have to play it! -WesTheDerp			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this frickin' game. It's important to note that there are a number of ways to play each level. Whether you want to go stealthy or barrel through for the intent of beating a time score, you will never be bored. It is a lot more fun to actually play than it may be to watch, however (as my friends may attest). As I was learning the game I found that every round I was in I discovered a new subtlety to the mechanics. It may get easier but it never gets boring. Easily enjoyed with people from all around the world.Crime is its own language. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably one of the most original, unique, and fun games I've played all year. If you like games like Payday, or if you're that one guy with pickpocketing level 100 in Skyrim, get this game! It is filled with stealth missions in which you infiltrate different areas and steal things, and ultimately makes you feel like a ninja. It is a frantic, class based, strategy game that never get's old. But this game really shines when you're playing with up to 4 friends. The crazy combat and funny dialogue will make you and your friends want to keep playing for hours. And given the low price, you have no reason not to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a stealth heist caper played from a topdown perspective, with a heavy emphasis on line-of-sight and moment-to-moment tactical planning in action. The colours and iconography are bold and lend themselves perfectly to the instant recognition needed as your eyes scan around your character constantly looking for your next move. Levels are fantastically designed and it's currently a joy to play in both single player and multiplayer (where the game really shines).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How  do I explain Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine? Amazing, heisting fun, a heister about going in, screwing up, and making it look like you meant to do that, especially in multiplayer which enhances the experience by many ways when playing with friends. Mulitiple charaters awith their own abilities all of them useful. Monaco is worth your money if you like stealth and fun multiplayers.Now to talk about an idea that they can makew as a new game. Same top down perspective, same or diffrent charaters, but a whole new way of approaching. Make it where you can go in day[s] before and scope out the place and prep the place for heisting. Figuring out what is where while posing as other civilians. Also add new devices such as flashdrives that make your hacker drone stay around longer and other such things.That is a review of Monaco: Whats Yours Is Mine and an idea of how to do a sequel or and entirely diffrent game.

												Monaco is an excellent 4-player co-op game that offers a unique blend of action and puzzle solving. If you're confused by what you're seeing in the store, don't be alarmed. The screenshots and videos don't do this game justice; you have to actually play the game for a bit to get a feeling for what's going on. All that color and chaos comes together nicely when you're playing.Monaco is decent entertainment as a single-player game, but the single-player game is best used to get familiar with each character at your own speed. Where Monaco really shines is when you get 2-4 people together in co-op mode. Different characters' abilities complement each other in surprising ways, and strategies emerge that simply aren't possible in solo play. Figuring out how to combine different characters' abilities to meet the unique challenges that each level presents is half the fun. If you don't have Steam friends to play with, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the Monaco community. This is a group that really likes to cooperate, and is patient with new players. The patient, cooperative play style of Monaco appeals to more mature gamers, and the public community really reflects that.I enthusiastically recommend Monaco. It’s a blast. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4/5More fun than a boat full of criminals.Monaco is a hide and stealth type heist game.  There are 8 characters to choose from, all with their own skills.  You spend your time sneaking around guards, hacking computers, opening vaults and stealing assets.Fun story, Lots of levels!  you can even make your own and upload them for others to play.Single player is challanging and fun.  Multi-player can range from ""Epic"" to ""All hell has broken loose"".  If you buy the game, you have to try multi-player at least once. It is so much fun, and has a great voice chat system.There is a Zombie mode as well...Monaco is one of those games I would buy for all of my friends to enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary: Heist simulator 2013Multiplayer: 4Completion: 5 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesWhen you were a kid, were you ever dragged to a social gathering and had nothing fun to do there? Monaco is the game I wish I had when I was growing up and taken to play party games with other people.In Monaco you assemble a team of specialized thieves intent on stealing goods and getting away with it. You have very limited tools to handle opposition, so you must stealth your way to the goods, grab it, and run like hell. It's pretty much as it sounds.The graphics have a rather simplistic look. They're serviceable, though the saturated palette can make it hard to see things, and is sometimes hard on the eyes. Music is also serviceable. It goes for a sort of ragtime feel, like watching a black and white film.Gameplay involves a top-down view of the area, much like looking at a blueprint, with security guards whose attention span could give MGS Genome Soldiers a run for their money. Electronic traps and security cameras also seek to alert your presence, but you can disable these should you find their terminal.If there's one thing Monaco does well, its promote teamwork. The character roles are so different and specialized that the more people you have the better your chances are of pulling this off... provided you work together.If there's one thing I would like to add to the game, it's having AI party members. I can't always get a party of four, and so I would like to have some meatshiel- I mean scapegoa- I mean accomplices to assist me in my solo capers.While Monaco isn't the kind of game I would replay for days on end, it does make a fantastic occasional party game. Sure beats playing most board games. I give Monaco a 7.5/10 Thanks spleeno!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this frickin' game. It's important to note that there are a number of ways to play each level. Whether you want to go stealthy or barrel through for the intent of beating a time score, you will never be bored. It is a lot more fun to actually play than it may be to watch, however (as my friends may attest). As I was learning the game I found that every round I was in I discovered a new subtlety to the mechanics. It may get easier but it never gets boring. Easily enjoyed with people from all around the world.Crime is its own language. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a stealth heist caper played from a topdown perspective, with a heavy emphasis on line-of-sight and moment-to-moment tactical planning in action. The colours and iconography are bold and lend themselves perfectly to the instant recognition needed as your eyes scan around your character constantly looking for your next move. Levels are fantastically designed and it's currently a joy to play in both single player and multiplayer (where the game really shines).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably one of the most original, unique, and fun games I've played all year. If you like games like Payday, or if you're that one guy with pickpocketing level 100 in Skyrim, get this game! It is filled with stealth missions in which you infiltrate different areas and steal things, and ultimately makes you feel like a ninja. It is a frantic, class based, strategy game that never get's old. But this game really shines when you're playing with up to 4 friends. The crazy combat and funny dialogue will make you and your friends want to keep playing for hours. And given the low price, you have no reason not to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I like to play games that offer you to accomplish tasks in stealth. This game offers variety of options to achieve that. And doing that in a good way. Thanks to the optimized difficulty and map design, you are not going to get frustrated. I highly reccommend this game to anyone willing to play online or solo. Overall it is a great game.

												Monaco ~A Short Review with no spoliers~I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment I began.The bright colors contrasted against the dark background, the fun music, and the multiplayer environment made for a terrifically fun experience.I played this game with another person,and by doing so, I feel that I got the most of the game, and thus I would recommend playing this with two or more people.Multiple playable characters, each with their own special abilities, are unlocked through a driving story line of criminal behavior -which was executed with the perfect balance of elements. This game was not as serious of a heist game as Payday 2, but it was not what I'd consider a “kiddy game”.When you assemble a team of the right characters for the mission at hand there's no way you can fail - that is unless you are me and my friends.Though you can fail multiple times, the fun never ends, at least it didn't for me. Each play through is different in itsownunique way, even though the layout of the levels is the same.Changing your characters may help if you fail a few times in a row.But when you just beat a level, it's not over. You can go back and try to “complete” the level, picking up every coin and every trophy. There's so much to do in this game, and that's why I love it.I didn't have a single complaint about the game with the catchy music and bright colors. I rate it 5/5, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys multiplayer heists.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my first review, and I've been a member of Steam for 4 years, so hopefully that tells you something.I bought this during the 2014 Summer sale, and have found it to be a great puzzle/heist game.Graphics:To start, if you have no desire for pixel and the retro look, then I would stop now. If you are not someone who NEEDS the incredible realism graphic engine, then you should be fine. The game gives you a couple of options for colors, but I found that the enhanced version was beautiful. The colors and shading/lighting make an awesome combination and really brings the game to life quickly. And it's not so much that it burns into your eyes either, so there's that.Audio:The music alone was awesome. I felt it was a rag-timey, pink panthery, mash up. Some of the songs had a great variation to some classic heist/jazz music that I thoroughly enjoyed. If you don't like, you can always turn off the music, but I felt it really added to the overall theme. When you almost get caught be a guard, the music changes to a faster tempo, trying to add to the suspense. It really felt more like a silent movie, where music was all you could really go off of for the tonality of the play.The sound effects were decent, there's not too much needed here.Gameplay:When I first started playing, I was lucky enough to have a few randoms in the lobby that were also new, but good spirited, so that definitely helped with the initial play through. But I will say it was a little difficult to start up and play at first, but that's my own impatience. The tutorial is actually part of the story, and if you have the patience to go and read all of it, it's actually pretty good. (I went back and read it, cause I'm typically very impatient and just want to play). Each character has their own special ability and it really does make a difference for each level. The strategy and puzzle of it comes from trying to figure out how to get by without getting caught; and if caught, trying to get away and hide. Sure, you could just run through, and try and out race the police, but the challenge is absolutely offered.  I've played with a group and solo, and found that it's WAY easier and ABSOLUTELY more fun with a group, if you can find one.All in all, I'd give the game somewhere between an 9/10. I only marked it down for two reasons: The pixel art is retro, and I get that, but a few more pixels, or less, on the police would make it more clear who they are. Could just be me, but I get a little confused about who I can and can't talk to. And (this isn't the game's fault) it's been a little difficult for me to find people to play with online.Hope this helps, happy gaming!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting play style that makes you think a lot (That is, if you want to get all of the coins). Fun 4 player game with a multitude of ways to complete levels. Lonely? Play in open lobbies as well, communication may be difficult, but whatever. Introvert? Play offline! Genius! What? Zombies? Of course, if you haven't noticed....every game is incorporating some zombie mode you can also play! For you creative ones, there is also an in-game level creator. Jump in and get crackin'!

												Very fun game, played a few hours so far.  Reminds me a lot of Hotline Miami, but with a slower pace that makes it easier to play.  I love the idea of having four specialized characters that each have a different skill.  It is fun to sneak around, knock out guards, hack computers and security systems while stealing money.

												Monaco is a surprise for me. I didn't have any thoughts about the game before buying it. And when I play the game, I see that the execution of the ideas is wonderful. I like to play games that offer you to accomplish tasks in stealth. This game offers variety of options to achieve that. And doing that in a good way. Thanks to the optimized difficulty and map design, you are not going to get frustrated. I highly reccommend this game to anyone willing to play online or solo. Overall it is a great game.

												Although confusing at first, Monaco is probably one of the most interesting games I've played... top down singleplayer/multiplayer heist game with different classes and many ways to play it. At first it's pretty easy, but then it gets pretty complicated. Now it's part of Humble Bundle XI package and there's no better time to get it. I think we're gonna spend some nice time together, me and this game...			",369,92,14,42,49,6,45

												Superb music, vibrant colors, and superb gameplay makes Monaco one of the best indie games i've played in 2013. Multiple classes, and the ability to play as any of them to clear a level,  adds replayability as you try to beat the clock or clear all the loot on each level. Monaco's multiplayer makes it even greater. The game is hectic as everyone tries to combine their individual skills to complete the game. While it's online multiplayer isn't the liveliest, the local co-op allows your for your friends and families to easily join in the fun. In short, this game is a real gem. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Break into the building, steal the things, and get out without raising the alarm. Sounds mediocre, right? WRONG. Monaco is a fantastic game, and that fact become clear immediately upon starting up. The gameplay is much like what I just described, but with a style all its own that I cannot say I have ever seen in anything else. It's totally unique, and that style pervades every element of Monaco. The music and artwork truly shine (This is one of the few indie soundtracks that I went out and bought, to bring credence to that fact.)Alone, it's great fun, but the developers had the foresight to add in a multiplayer co-op mode- this instantly pushed a good game to great. The online chaos that may ensue, or the local co-op  madness (If you have spare controllers or keyboards) are nearly reminiscent of the great Nintendo multiplayer experiences of yore. So, if you have the money to spend, get this. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally a game designed to encourage teamplay amongst friends. Get it for a group of buddies and you'll be having a grand old time in no time. The screw-ups are great for laughs all around and it gets challenging enough towards the end to give four brains working in unison a run for their money. The story is intriguing and the music is quite nice. If you have a single friend in the world, then you will enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game! Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is one which has had me spending hours at a time beating the crap out of gendarme, smoking the heck out of innocent(but nonetheless annoying) civilians, and pushing about the mangled corpses of security guards. Monaco really allows one to explore different gameplay methods and tactics when it comes to taking on the challenges each level sets for you. Wonderful music from wonderful singers, and the art style never gets boring. Multiplayer is also excellent when playing with friends, the system is very easy to understand and use. Sadly, there are hardly any players to play with via multiplayer. Monaco has also taught me quite some bit of french. J'aime le français!8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The variety in charcaters and their ablities means any type of person can find a character they like. Replay value is high, with leaderboards pushing you to get a top time. A definite buy so go get a 4-pack and play it with some friends. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was part of the core group of beta testers for this game and even have my name appearing in its credits. I invested dozens of hours into the work-in-progress version of the game and thoroughly enjoyed it. The premise is theft - and you can choose from a handful of different character classes that all possess unique abilities to to pull off a successful theft (the ability to smash through walls, hack into security systems, assassinate guards, pose as guards and more). The game affords for hilarious, whimsical encounters as one progresses through a map collecting treasures that all play into a single narrative or over-arching storyline. If you are a fan of robbery/theft films and games, you'll enjoy Monaco.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My new favorite stealth game. This game has atmosphere out the wazoo and the rock-solid gameplay to keep you coming back even after that wears off. In that sense, it's a lot like Hotline Miami. The classes all feel different, but you could use any combination and still pull off a mission.The music is PERFECT. Stealth music instantly and seamlessly transitions to chase music the second you're discovered, which is simply a joy from a visceral and gameplay perspective.I could go on about this game forever.

												Was cool for a while. I put 15 hours into it because over the years I kept reinstalling it and having to redo all the missions. It is fun and not very hard playing alone until you get to a massive difficulty spike in the next to last thief mission where it is strikingly apparant that this game was meant to mainly be a co-op/multiplayer game. In which you won't find anyone to connect to online because it's so old, so either search the forums for someone to play with or have a friend that also has the game. Also, if you do play co-op or mp, voice chat is basically a must. Without voice communication to closely work together, it will be a mess. I mean missions are certainly doable just fine without it but the game is a much, much more fun experience if you can communicate with voice.6/10 okay for a while			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a great looking artsy game with a great concept and, to a certain extent, this concept works out very well. More in singleplayer than multiplayer. Think of Monaco as a 1-4 player(s) Pacman-like heist game; collect as many coins as you can, grab some loot and then make a run for it. Sounds great, doesn't it ? Yes, as a concept. In reality it could've been so much better. Let me try to explain.First of all, I've been waiting for this game to be released for a long time, and now that it has finally been released I can't help but feel disappointed. Why ? Because in co-op the game is just so damn hectic and it's hard to see your location or any location for that matter. There are no instructions on how to use your character and their abilities properly. You can see why that's distracting when you're playing with other people. Your partners have certain expectations and instead of actually helping you're running around making it look like you know what you're doing. But you actually don't know. People (including yourself) will ragequit because of this. They're unforgiving. Sure, not everyone, but a lot of my games have ended that way. Also, the AI is a bit random from time to time, so there's no right way to finish a level. You need a bit of strategy and also a whole lot of luck. One thing that could instantly make this game better is by simply increasing your field of vision, giving you a better sight while walking around, and giving you more of an idea on what to do next.The single-player mode is thankfully less hectic, but still doesn't really teach you how to use your abilities properly. In single-player you can't get resurrected (obviously) so, instead, you have a certain amount of lives. Die and you can't use that character anymore and this continues until you run out of characters (i.e. lives).Now, on the other hand, Monaco has more than enough content and some missions should take you over 30 minutes to finish. They can certainly be fun while playing with  a group of friends.This little review does make it look like I hate it, but I really don't. I truly like this game, I just wish it was better on certain fronts, or maybe a bit more open to get rid of the chaos entirely. Make sure you give it a spin if you have a group of friends who you can communicate with, that should certainly help.[Rating: 80/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The vibrant colours and upbeat retro music makes the game not only appealing to the eyes, but the ears. The characters are original and unique. Gameplay gets abit repetitive yet still enjoyable throughout. Gameplay mechanics are decent, however the controls are abit clunky at times. Overall, I'd give it a strong 7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you do, then go ahead and buy it.A cooperative stealth/collection game, Monaco offers a variety of ways to play with its ecclectic cast of characters. With skills unique to each character, such as Disguise, Spot and Breaking Down Walls, playing with a different set of team members will create a whole new approach to each carefully designed level.

												Monaco: What's Yours is mine is a 1-4 player co-op heist game, a lovely 8-bit game where you sneak through locations while trying to steal valuable goods, and is a game I cannot recommend more heartily.  This is one of the indie sensations like Fez and Bastion that were being talked about and were winning awards before the game was even released, so it would be CRIMINAL (pardon the pun) to ignore a game with as much accolades as Monaco.The gameplay revolves around each level being a bit like a puzzle.  There are guards, security cameras, alarms, motion detectors, and other things that you have to bypass in order to get the gold, documents, or money and escape.  Each player gets to choose a different thief that specializes in different things; every thief can do everything necessary to beat a mission, but the Lockpick can pick locks and safes much faster, the Pickpocket can gather gold much more safely than others, the Mole can break through walls, and so on.  Choosing your specialist comes down to playstyle more than necessity, which is very nice since that means your team can be built around what everyone likes most instead of needing to play this or that character.  This really lets people get into the game by picking the burglar that they think is coolest or most fun.Important note: By no means is this a game that depends on flawless execution.  The most fun is when the alarm inevitably goes off and you and your friends scramble trying to grab the money and still escape, with an army of guards chasing you the entire way.  These are the most enjoyable moments of the game, where everything has gone wrong and you're still desperately trying to get the money and escape while everyone is laughing and trying to hide and being shot at.  This is definitely a fun little party game, and though the later levels require a little planning, it truly is a great game to play with friends or family of any age.I cannot recommend this game higher as a co-op game for you and a few friends.  Buy it, bring a friend or two over if you have some controllers, and enjoy Monaco, where What's There is Yours.			",385,103,6,51,41,5,79

The next moment, someone accidentally blunders into a motion sensor, and you're in a Benny Hill chase scene. Monaco can move from slow and stealthy to antic and frantic at the drop of a hat, and it's loads of fun either way. Get a full team for local multiplayer for the best experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great investment. I expected kind of an action puzzle game but the game is far more than this. The whole setting is very atmospheric, prison break, bank heist, rescueing a fellow criminal from a mansion. There are so many things to interact with like light barriers, vents, computers to hack in, the breaker box in the wine cellar and of course the guards that are animated sooo funny. If this wasn't enough, you get kind of a gangster movie soundtrack of the silent film age. It fits perfectly! Everything in this games fits. The multiplayer matches with friends are awesome. The best experience is sitting in a room and hear everybody screaming when the alarm at the museum you're robbing goes off. You have to buy this game and play it hard. Hopefully it's cheaper on christmas holidays (steam plz :D) so we get more good players online.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't know why, but there's something about a good heist. When I first heard about this game it instantly spoke to me. It has charm, humor, uniquw classes, and an interesting soundtrack. While it can be played alone, the game really shines when played with people. It's really fun how one moment everyone is performing their role (picking locks, scouting enemy locations, silently taking guards out, etc), then all of a sudden someone fumbles...the music changes...and then it's utter chaos with everyone running in around scrambling to escape and survive.

												This is a really good game.  It's a top down sneak game with a wide array of characters to choose from.  You play a few levels and it's really easy, and you think ""oh, this'll be an easy 100%.""Wrong.  There are over 30 levels to complete, and about halfway it starts to ramp up the difficulty.  Guards are everywhere, lasers are everywhere, trip lasers are everywhere, and then later all the lasers have shotguns on them (not kidding.)  Towards the end the difficulty is ramped up so high it's just brutal.But it's a good kind of difficulty.  You can't just barrel your way through the game and then get mad when it punishes you.  If you take things slow, plan out your course of action, then even the hardest levels are posssible.8/10There are some sneak elements that're missing but overall a very satisfying game.

												Excerpt from the handbook of The Security Professionals Association of Monaco:""Dear future security officer, congratulations on choosing one of today's most exciting career opportunities in the Principality of Monaco. You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:- If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing.- If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it.- If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1.- Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at.- Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY.- Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER.- Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO.- Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting♥♥♥♥♥is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.With these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees.""[[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Each of the characters brings unique abilities to the table, and all the variables in it make every replay of a map feel different. Plus they're adding a level editor as free DLC. Bombing, tunnelling, hacking, lockpicking, safecracking, chloroforming, disguising, stealing, flirting, dog-dodging fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game that truly shines in the co-op multiplayer, especially while playing locally or on a LAN. Each level in this game starts out as Ocean's Eleven, but can quickly turn into Boondock Saints.  Success depends upon a combination of coordination and improvisation, as well as clever use of the distinct characters and their unique abilities. Single-player can also provide its own challenges, as you have fewer ""tools"" with your team of one.After three years of development, this is an indie game that exhibits a lot of polish. From the intuitive implemenation of stealth to the clever level design to the fast-paced music, it's easy to see why Monaco won multiple awards at the Independent Games Festival in 2010. It plays well with a keyboard or controller and with Steam Workshop, there is an endless amount of content, from tutorials to PvP arenas.Also: trading cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a game that’s as much about thinking on your feet as it is about stealth and forward planning, and regardless of whether you’re after a fun co-op game for four people, or something to speedrun to impress people on YouTube, I daresay there’s something here for everyone thanks to its focus on sheer entertainment. It’s exquisitely pieced together in almost every way, it lets you play in a variety of different ways and challenges you to think outside the box, and I can’t imagine anyone that could fail to be taken in by its charms.Monaco is a fantastic and unique take on the stealth genre and a showcase of excellent design, and you should make it yours. Not getting your hands on this would be a crime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I didn't really 'get' this game or why it was so good. I didn't care about the co-op either, as I figured playing with random people wouldn't be great. Then I found myself playing it all weekend and absolutely loving it, and hugely enjoying co-op with random people as well.It seems really simple at first, but the game has a lot of depth. You start to realise how many options you have for dealing with the levels, and the levels go from the trivial opening ones to incredibly difficult end ones. The middle levels are wonderful and the later levels are a huge challenge. A good co-op team can help but isn't required.The people playing the game are properly into it and everyone seems to intuitively understand what each other is doing, and it's a lot of fun.Highly recommended!

												Monaco is a great co-op dungeon run. Or maybe you could compare it favorably to Left 4 Dead. It's a great game.There's no accumulation of loot like you find in MMOs or ARPGs, but this is a feature, not a flaw. Since everyone starts equally, it's easier to pull people into a game at any given time. You don't have to worry about whether your character is too high a level or too low a level, or whether you have the ""proper"" gear. You just get get up to 4 people together and just do it.It has a forgiving ""death"" mode, much like Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, or Guild Wars 2. When playing with friends, if you are downed, you can be recovered by another player. As long as one person is still alive, the game continues!It also has several different modes of success. You can just try to complete the level. You can try to clean it out entirely. Or you can try to do both of the above against the clock. For the hardcore, speedruns may be their thing. For the more casual player, survival might be the challenge. And there are different versions/difficulties of each of the levels, so unlocking those is another potential goal. And of course there are ""cheevos"" through Steam for doing other silly things. So there's a lot to aim for with this game.The graphics are stylish, the music is perfect, and the dialogue witty. My only criticism is that it's a little hard to figure out the ""ring"" of indicators surrounding your character. Parsing that data is hard with all of the other visual distractions on the screen at any given time. But by the time you learn 'em, it's mostly moot. At that point you will probably have enough experience with the game not to need 'em too much.And the price? Cheap! I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer.  Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play.  Playing with friends is where this excels.  Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun.  If you dont have this and see it on offer for under  £2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine a game developed by Pocketwatch Games is an absolute masterpiece, I have been following this game since the day it was announced a couple of years back, and from the time I played it when it first came out to now, I must say that the game has really changed, adding more and more features into the game. Kinda reminds me of Thief but top-down and more comical than the dark Thief. An absolute masterpiece and at a very cheap price (Free Weekend) and best of all, it is best played with your friends!What's mine is yours, and Monaco is mine! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is it trying to be a stealth 'em up or an action-me-do? I couldn't really tell. I had some decent fun with the game despite it being a bit muddled and directionless, until later on when the missions became ridiculous. The multiplayer is a laugh. Overall I'd recommend it but don't expect anything groundbreaking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally like Monaco, and I know this sounds stupid, but I personaly think that Monaco is a ""birdseye"" PayDay, but more Stealth than Gun. (Unless you play Gun)  Every character has different abilities, so its important you get a charater your good at, and will get the job done. Over all, this is pretty fun, the campain is short, but doing it again with friends brings the meaning back. Personaly, I think the level editor is hard. But It's just not my thing. Worth the $15.00, and gives you a hindsight experiance of tense moments of the ultimate hiest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is easily one of my favourite games in my big games library. A quirky stealth action, you take the role of 4 characters, at the start, The Locksmith, The Pickpocket, The Lookout and The Cleaner. Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard.So in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.

												Very fun game, alone or with friends. It's simple, yet complex at the same time- And each mission is unique, so you won't feel like you are repeating the same thing over and over again, and with each different class means a different way of finishing the mission! No matter your skill, It gets harder as you go along, so you're guaranteed to face a challenge at some point. As for faults, personally, if any, is going to have to be with Multiplayer. Anybody can join, beginners or advanced, so each time is different. But, it lacks challenge. A team-member can be reckless and set off all the guards and what not, or everyone can go off and do their own thing, and the mission can still be completed, I wish it could be more along the lines of, one wrong move and your entire mission will fail, hence forcing teamwork. Other than that, I'd give the game 4/5 stars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolutely fantastic game to play locally with 3 of your friends, though I can't quite get my head around why one of us was forced to use a keyboard and mouse rather than a 4th controller. The game's biggest strength is its simplicity; you get your choice of 4 characters (8 by the end) and each has one distinct function, with perhaps one other side function. You take your little team through numerous 3 or 4 level stages and try to steal as much stuff as you can, as fast as you can, while trying not to be seen. We were incredibly bad at it but still managed to finish the main campaign and have 12 hours of fun on a lazy Sunday doing it.Also, you revive your teammates by pressing against their dead bodies while your character makes a bunch of slurping noises. Just saying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a must buy for such a low price! Easy to understand when you start off playing. A great combination of stealth play, tower heist and a 16 bit colourful retro theme. Plus the light piano music & french accents is like the cherry on top. Also a bird eye view setting.If you feel like stealing a bunch of valuable objects from buildings with plenty of security guards that you can either kill or make confused as hell, then you'll love this game.There's a choice of 4+ characters with distinct unique abilities to help disarm alarms, hack computers, unlock doors, break down walls, you name it! You can pick up weapons too (AK-47s, spanners, C9s) but I find that breaks the stealth mode you want to enjoy and should really be used if you have no other option.There are plenty of levels to play with character stories behind them. Co-op of up to 4 players is a great feature with so much more room for activities!Super fun, highly recommended 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excerpt from the handbook of The Security Professionals Association of Monaco:""Dear future security officer, congratulations on choosing one of today's most exciting career opportunities in the Principality of Monaco. You are about to embark on an adventure unlike any other: guarding the wealth of some of the most powerful and famous people on the planet. Here are some useful guidelines to performing your job at the level of excellence and thoroughness that our customers have come to expect of us:- If you should face the possibility of dealing with an intruder, take a few seconds to make extra sure that it wasn't nothing. It was probably nothing.- If you are absolutely certain that you have spotted an intruder, but then lose track, don't feel too bad, somebody else has probably taken care of it.- If you should suddenly remember being in a firefight and losing sight of intruders mere moments ago - calm down. Go back to your post, and if you should see something again: remember rule #1.- Now for the most important rule: potted plants are sacred and must never be disturbed or looked at.- Do you think you saw somebody walk behind a potted plant? Maybe even four people? Do you think that you could find out for sure if you just, you know, looked at the plant? WELL TOUGH LUCK, DUMBASS, YOU HAD BETTER MADE ABSOLUTELY SURE FIRST SO GO BACK AND DO YOUR DUTY.- Somebody tried to hide behind a potted plant while you were in a firefight and you're absolutely 100% completely sure he is still there? FINE. SHOOT AT THE PLANT. See how you feel about it when we cut your paycheck, vacation and transfer you to guarding the basement toilets for the next 30 years, PLANTKILLER.- Also sacred? VENTS. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT MESS WITH THE VENTS. If an intruder is going inside a vent, DO NOT PURSUE. DO NOT SHOOT AT THE VENT. Do you know how to fix a vent? Cause I sure don't. SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING CAUSE ALL OF US TO SUFFOCATE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO.- Finally, if you happen to shoot an intruder, do. not. touch. the. body. You probably didn't attend any biology classes so allow me to break it down for you: dead bodies carry HORRIBLE TERRIBLE DISEASES. Leave them exactly where they drop and return to your station immediately. Somebody better equipped to handle the situation than your plant-killing vent-shooting♥♥♥♥♥is surely going to come and take care of it. We have found that bodies have a tendency to disappear more quickly when left unattended.With these simple guidelines you should have a blast in your new job! In light of recent unexpected mortality spikes we hope that you understand that we had to revoke all life insurance policies for new employees.""[[On a more serious note, if you have a bunch of friends to play then Monaco is a funny, challenging and surprisingly complex co-op heist game, featuring a nice soundtrack and multiple free expansions.]]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a game that’s as much about thinking on your feet as it is about stealth and forward planning, and regardless of whether you’re after a fun co-op game for four people, or something to speedrun to impress people on YouTube, I daresay there’s something here for everyone thanks to its focus on sheer entertainment. It’s exquisitely pieced together in almost every way, it lets you play in a variety of different ways and challenges you to think outside the box, and I can’t imagine anyone that could fail to be taken in by its charms.Monaco is a fantastic and unique take on the stealth genre and a showcase of excellent design, and you should make it yours. Not getting your hands on this would be a crime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I didn't really 'get' this game or why it was so good. I didn't care about the co-op either, as I figured playing with random people wouldn't be great. Then I found myself playing it all weekend and absolutely loving it, and hugely enjoying co-op with random people as well.It seems really simple at first, but the game has a lot of depth. You start to realise how many options you have for dealing with the levels, and the levels go from the trivial opening ones to incredibly difficult end ones. The middle levels are wonderful and the later levels are a huge challenge. A good co-op team can help but isn't required.The people playing the game are properly into it and everyone seems to intuitively understand what each other is doing, and it's a lot of fun.Highly recommended!

												This game is almost 'Realistic' from a birds perspective. You can play as different escaped prisoners or people they free in the game. The Hacker is my favourite cause it can deactivate all the electronics for a short while where you walk close too. I Highly recommend to play this game with friends or people who know what they do with they Character and/or the level. You also see the spots like with a coloured perspective like in real life. I mean, when you have a closed door you can't see what's behind it even with the perspective. You can only see, what we also can see if we stand there. Also everyone can make hiding spots in the bushes on some maps to prevent that cops find them easily as they walk by. The weapon system and Equipment system is also a new sort of way to play, you get an extra item of the item you got by collecting money. In overall it's a game who wants to be sneaky, stealth, rich, demolishfull, a charmer or a codebreaker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basically everyone is working together to steal something, and then make a get away. Each class brings something unique to the table. The story is great. What this game excels at though is the casual fun that is to be had with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a top-down heist game where you choose one of four characters (with an additional four unlocked as the story progresses), break out of prison, and then with the help of the mysterious Gentleman, attempt to flee Monaco. The story is in two parts, first told from the perspective of the Locksmith over 17 levels, then retold by the Pickpocket in another 16. There's also a level builder, and you can download new levels to play in the Steam community workshop.I'd call this a Stealth game, but the stealth often decays into a mad dash to run out of sight of enemies or to make a mad dash away from the C4 you just placed to blow open a safe or wall or security guard. The background music is reminiscent of ragtime piano, and changes to suit the situation if you're spotted or set off alarms.It's good in single-player, but where Monaco truly shines is 4-player co-op.I've very much enjoyed this game, and it's on sale (50% off) at the moment. Go buy this game, because it's great. :3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great investment. I expected kind of an action puzzle game but the game is far more than this. The whole setting is very atmospheric, prison break, bank heist, rescueing a fellow criminal from a mansion. There are so many things to interact with like light barriers, vents, computers to hack in, the breaker box in the wine cellar and of course the guards that are animated sooo funny. If this wasn't enough, you get kind of a gangster movie soundtrack of the silent film age. It fits perfectly! Everything in this games fits. The multiplayer matches with friends are awesome. The best experience is sitting in a room and hear everybody screaming when the alarm at the museum you're robbing goes off. You have to buy this game and play it hard. Hopefully it's cheaper on christmas holidays (steam plz :D) so we get more good players online.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally like Monaco, and I know this sounds stupid, but I personaly think that Monaco is a ""birdseye"" PayDay, but more Stealth than Gun. (Unless you play Gun)  Every character has different abilities, so its important you get a charater your good at, and will get the job done. Over all, this is pretty fun, the campain is short, but doing it again with friends brings the meaning back. Personaly, I think the level editor is hard. But It's just not my thing. Worth the $15.00, and gives you a hindsight experiance of tense moments of the ultimate hiest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After viewing the trailer for this game I wasn't exactly sure what I thought, it looked like it would be fun or it could be a horrible clunky mess of a game. After taking a gamble on this game I was not disappointed. I have not played many top down stealth games which have run this smoothly or been this much fun. The story, as minimalist as it is, is surprisingly engaging as well. If you're a fan of local coop and like playing games in the same room as your friends this game should probably be on your shortlist of must haves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is easily one of my favourite games in my big games library. A quirky stealth action, you take the role of 4 characters, at the start, The Locksmith, The Pickpocket, The Lookout and The Cleaner. Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard.So in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.

												Indie games like this can be easily described as having basic and inviting graphics, mixed with well tuned and well thought out gameplay. Monaco showcases this in all of its glory, and makes being a spy feel so great. A multiplayer must. DON'T STEP ON CATS/BIRDS/TRIPWIRES/GUARDS.  Come, let us be bad spies together!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't know why, but there's something about a good heist. When I first heard about this game it instantly spoke to me. It has charm, humor, uniquw classes, and an interesting soundtrack. While it can be played alone, the game really shines when played with people. It's really fun how one moment everyone is performing their role (picking locks, scouting enemy locations, silently taking guards out, etc), then all of a sudden someone fumbles...the music changes...and then it's utter chaos with everyone running in around scrambling to escape and survive.

The vibrant colours and upbeat retro music makes the game not only appealing to the eyes, but the ears. The characters are original and unique. Gameplay gets abit repetitive yet still enjoyable throughout. Gameplay mechanics are decent, however the controls are abit clunky at times. Overall, I'd give it a strong 7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kinda reminds me of Thief but top-down and more comical than the dark Thief. An absolute masterpiece and at a very cheap price (Free Weekend) and best of all, it is best played with your friends!What's mine is yours, and Monaco is mine!

												It's just pure fun with a group of friends. The controls are tight and it's one of my best looking indie games I've ever seen, whoever designed the menus and maps knows his graphic design. Voice acting does a great job of conveying the right atmosphere and it just makes me want to discuss tactics with a bad french accent. The developer is making a great job of updating this game for free and it also has Steam Workshop support for even more extra content. It's my personal indie game of 2013.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is really chaotic, but by the time it's understandable, how to play it.Sometimes, I was getting lags (maybe also generally because of host) and at some action (it could be because of something of my computer, not by the game).Often it was hard to connect on some server and sometimes I was disconnected from the server, because the game was ended by the host during the playing/game...I wouldn't pay for that game.Somebody likes these types of games, but someone doesn't enjoy these types of games.I just tried this game. Also, it's not such a bad game.You can choose there of some other specific characters (with/for whom You'll play current game)  and modes.There are a lot of sorts of maps and functions.There is also single-player mode and also multiplayer mode, so You can play alone or also with other players and your friends......etc.·˙_____________________________________________˙·.*Edit [7. april 2014 - 3:15 PM]     Over time I have changed my opinion at this game. Who loves these types of the games, then it's great game with lots of functions.Also, You can try 'tutorial' in the game, through which are explained specific functions of characters.*Edit [24. november 2016 - 4:05 PM]Corrected a few grammar mistakes.

Single player too hard? Try multiplayer and suck with your friends.Pros: Fun game that takes little set up to play with friends, lots of levels to unlock and play. Looks great, and provides as much challange as you put into it.Cons: setting up a private game takes a little finagling. lots of rubberbanding when there's many AI on screen			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game because it was on sale and looked fairly unique, but I wasn't expecting very much. I was wrong. This game is one of the best buys I've made during my time on steam. The trailer's don't necessarily do the graphics justice, which have really clear visuals, and a minimalistic, but aesthetically pleasing neon art style. The soundtrack is also killer, capturing the perfect tone. The gameplay is fantastic, akin to pacman with stealth, guns, and laser-rigged security systems. There is little in the way of tutorial, so you are left to experiment for yourself,but that works well for this for this game, which has you balance careful planning, against quick thinking and resourcefulness for when things go wrong. The plot was also pretty fresh, while nodding to tropes within the heist genre. The game offers a lot of replayability too, as though the single player is fun and carries the game by itself, the multiplayer enables you to play with others to try and try to grab everything and get out as fast as possible. In addition to this, the community is pretty good, and new levels are often being made. Of course, no game is perfect, and if I had to say something, it would be that though the plot was great, it was advanced sparingly from mission to mission. If story is what you look for in a game, this may not be the game for you. Also, although you don't have to collect every coin to ""win"" a mission, if the coins are ignored some missions lose a lot of challenge, especially as on some earlier missions the number of lives you have is fairly generous. However, there are a lot of levels (3 parallel campaigns, with a 4th coming out soon, as well as zombie mode), so this would only bother those exceptionally impatient people who can't wait to unlock the later levels, which are extraordinarily challenging, even if you don't collect the coins!I would definitely give this game a 10/10 as it stands, and am very excited to play the new content which is coming out this year			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short, this game is about Heist. Get in, Rob, Get Out.It's long after I played Monaco with my friends (4 players Co-Op of course, that was a blast!)I decided to give a review, so apologize for any things I may forgot to mention below :By far, Monaco as an Indie game has great, solid, satisfying Coop experience. Team up with four players and break through buildings to sweep all shiny things you see. And four players can wreak havoc entire building, alerting every guards to chase you down. It's all the hilarous things popping out at every moment. One small misstep and the place will turn into chaos.Gameplay, Characters : You are a robber who steal stuffs in the city of Monaco. Like other heist games, this game requires avoiding guards patrolling here and there, stealing things, open doors, and hide in bushes. When played single player, this game have several lives which when the one you chose die, other characters show up to be picked again. So in total there are 8 characters, meaning you have 8 lives to do the single player campaign (Which I will say quite easy to do just a run, but not when doing a perfect one). Multiplayer, this is where the fun comes from. Up to four players, at the same time sneaking into a building filled with psychopath guards (there're psycho doctors too, hope this game doesn't change your perception), lasers, and... if I remember correctly, there are cats and dogs too, meowing and barking to alert the psychos. Four players, I have to admit, is less strategic than single player, if not pre-planned first. One player can cause havoc in one section, while others, panicking by the alerts, cause much more chaos and the whole place is about hit & run till you cut off from the guard's sight or die. And that's where the fun lies, saving your dead friend while being chased and shot by guards.Characters, there are 8 total characters to play with, 4 starting characters each with unique abilities. One can open locks fast, one can seek out guards on the map, one can loot coins automatically, and else. They're fun in their own ways.Controls, Mechanics, AIs : Pretty solid, and simple controls to handle. Only WASD to move and a mouse to aim & shoot the baddies along the way. Weapons are also fun to play with, shotgun can kill multiple enemies, a bomb can blow up a place in certain radius, health kit can restore half of your life upon use, and tranquilizer to make enemies sleep. Mechanics are pretty good and well-thought. You can plan a whole stealthy, sneaky robbery, or do an all-out rampage, taking everything in the path while escaping as soon as possible. AIs are also creative, chasing you down all the way until you die, or you can sneak behind them, leaving question marks along the way.Levels, Difficulties, Maps : Very creative, and the levels are designed in a way that you might be involved in a heist film. Hide into a bush, getting sneaky, turn off the lasers and lights. There are so many things to play with before the robbery happens and the grand escape begins. Difficulty-wise, the pacing is perfect for a heist game. While I did have to retry a few times at the first act, after knowing the mechanics of the AI, the rest of the act is about executing and improving your heist skills.Story : I didn't read the story though, I skipped all the dialogues, so yeah I'll skip this one. But it's quite interesting and easy to pick-up.Music : Loved the theme song, and the Discotheque Rouge (If I'm not wrong) level. Musics are catchy like actual heist movies, and they are French-themed, so they're unique in French ways. Cons : So far haven't found any cons, only that the difficulty curve at the start is probably a bit high (I haven't played any heist games, so that should be counted as a factor too)Tl;dr, get this game with your other 3 friends. Break into buildings, one by one and make chaos all over Monaco! 100% Fun and laughter guaranteed!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												whether or not you will enjoy this game really depends (its kind of like napaleon dynamite) people seem to have widly differnt views of this game. I personally enjoyed it immensly however other people I know that have the didn't really have fun with it. However you dont have to like the game to appreciate the art and music in this game. The sound track is a perfect fit for this game.+great co-op+amazing soundtrack +level editor+great art design-kind of ""meh"" story-unless you have a very skilled team the last few levels are exceptionally hard.The game as of 4/3/2014 is on sale for $3.74 so you have really no reason not to pick it up.

												Monaco is an intelligent and fun stealth game. Though it can be rather boring when playing alone, if you have a couple other friends who have the game it's a blast. It has and extremely unique and colourful art design as well as one of my favourite sound tracks in any game. If you have friends who can play it with you I see no reason not to get it.

												If you enjoy 2D, retro-style games, you will love Monaco. It truly shines as a cooperative experience.You can go through most of the story completely solo (and at times it may be easier for some levels), and the game offers an offline/online feature that is very well integrated. Levels you have unlocked will have a marker indicating open lobby sessions, making it easier to join up for cooperative play. The steam workshop also has fantastic mods, including two CRITICAL tutorials that everyone should go through to get a good feel for the game. The jewel store from PAYDAY 2 is a particularly exciting one. Replayability just for these mods is endless.The aesthetics are great, and the fog of war mechanic is beautifully-executed: there will be a blueprint for each level (including floors), and you will only be able to see the details of your character's field of vision, the rest will remain gray. You can see nearby footsteps of your enemies, but require the Lookout character for constant enemy awareness. This makes for intense gameplay when you are in one area of the map and die, while your other teammates are on the other side, all running away from guards.The layout is still very friendly as your objectives will be indicated by large trophies on the map, and there usually be many signs on the ground to give you directions. The ""action"" timer is given by a small circle that fills up for everything you may have to do, from opening a window to unlocking a door so you can go into the urinal and pee (yes, there is an animation for peeing).The game incorporates an ""ammo"" system for whatever active item you have equipped (ex: C4, shotgun, smoke grenade, etc) that gives you +1 whenever you collect 10 of the yellow collectibles. While you share the total team score with your party at the end, your specific ammo count is individual, so you may have to decide who collects the resources if they are running low.Each character class comes with different skills and responsiblities, making for very diverse gameplay (and high replayability).Very charming cooperative (initally) game. (There are PvP modes lol)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The real gem in my game library. Monaco is a co-op heist game with 4 players just like PAYDAY (btw there're some PAYDAY maps available to play in the workshop). Like I said, my favorite part in the game is Community made levels (my favorite is PAYDAY maps). Sure the original campaign is good, but the community made maps have a lot of detailed hand crafted game mechanism. So why aren't you buying this?! go ahead buy the game without hestitate!

												Whats yours is mine, and whats on offer here is a simple concept, done really well, provides a lot of entertainment, and is all about the multiplayer.  Monaco flys under the radar for a lot of people as it isn't a big name title, and doesnt pretend to be, but the number of different ways you can play the game using different characters with different skills mean there is no right or wrong way to get through the game, although inevitably people will find their own style of play.  Playing with friends is where this excels.  Those moments when someone gets caught and dies in a really stupid place full of laser beams and guards and then trying to come in with a plan to create enough of a distraction for someone to get in and revive them is so much fun.  If you dont have this and see it on offer for under  £2, buy a few copies for your mates, and it will easily repay it with the entertainment time it gives you back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The vibrant colours and upbeat retro music makes the game not only appealing to the eyes, but the ears. The characters are original and unique. Gameplay gets abit repetitive yet still enjoyable throughout. Gameplay mechanics are decent, however the controls are abit clunky at times. Overall, I'd give it a strong 7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco: What's Yours is mine is a 1-4 player co-op heist game, a lovely 8-bit game where you sneak through locations while trying to steal valuable goods, and is a game I cannot recommend more heartily.  This is one of the indie sensations like Fez and Bastion that were being talked about and were winning awards before the game was even released, so it would be CRIMINAL (pardon the pun) to ignore a game with as much accolades as Monaco.The gameplay revolves around each level being a bit like a puzzle.  There are guards, security cameras, alarms, motion detectors, and other things that you have to bypass in order to get the gold, documents, or money and escape.  Each player gets to choose a different thief that specializes in different things; every thief can do everything necessary to beat a mission, but the Lockpick can pick locks and safes much faster, the Pickpocket can gather gold much more safely than others, the Mole can break through walls, and so on.  Choosing your specialist comes down to playstyle more than necessity, which is very nice since that means your team can be built around what everyone likes most instead of needing to play this or that character.  This really lets people get into the game by picking the burglar that they think is coolest or most fun.Important note: By no means is this a game that depends on flawless execution.  The most fun is when the alarm inevitably goes off and you and your friends scramble trying to grab the money and still escape, with an army of guards chasing you the entire way.  These are the most enjoyable moments of the game, where everything has gone wrong and you're still desperately trying to get the money and escape while everyone is laughing and trying to hide and being shot at.  This is definitely a fun little party game, and though the later levels require a little planning, it truly is a great game to play with friends or family of any age.I cannot recommend this game higher as a co-op game for you and a few friends.  Buy it, bring a friend or two over if you have some controllers, and enjoy Monaco, where What's There is Yours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have now dumped more hours in Monaco than any other game, except for my top 2 favorite games. You know what that means? It's my 3rd favorite. I liked it that much. I beat the game multiplayer with my friends and it was a blast. I beat it by myself and still had hectic fun. Through and through the clever gameplay, awesome action, and even the story were fantastic. Completely worthy of all the praise it gets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is easily one of my favourite games in my big games library. A quirky stealth action, you take the role of 4 characters, at the start, The Locksmith, The Pickpocket, The Lookout and The Cleaner. Each with their own abilities, and hidden abilities, to aid themselves, or their team. You play through and unlock more characters each with their own unique abilites and ways to aid. Honestly this game is best played MP where it can get out of hand and chaotic, which to be honest is where the most fun is. Running from guards desperatly trying to revive your teammates while being careful that dog doesn't get to you, it's really enjoyable. If you are a completionist then best avoid this as to 100% you have to get 4 trophies, they are as followed: completed in SP, completed in MP, completed without dying (or if doing on MP none of you can die) and finally cleaning out the level, which you must do for EVERY level. Some of the later levels get ridiculously hard.So in summary I would definitly reccommend this game and you should buy it, especially because the Dev who made it is a really nice guy.

												Usually I don't like co-op or multiplayer modes, but for this game it works really well. The missions start off pretty easy at first, but the later missions get tougher and it makes you want to find other people to complete the missions. I haven't checked out all the missions yet, but there are some additional features that gives the game a lot of replay value. Worth picking up and playing with some friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is the first game I’ve played that truly nails the feeling of the heist, with enough traps, items, and different characters that co-op play with friends should be a staple of your online activity for the months to come. However, the over-long campaign is a chore when played solo, especially when the story suffers as a result. If you and your friends are looking for a new game to play together, Monaco is a no-brainer. But playing through Monaco by yourself, or leaving your enjoyment up to groups of strangers, can yield uneven results.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a pleasure to play. Four player co-op itself is a strong selling point for a game; adding a terrific art style and a dynamic soundtrack makes this game all the more appealing. What makes this game a must-have, though? The fight-or-flight gameplay style. You can sneak your way through, looting every coin and dodging every guard, or you can dive in all Tally-HO! into the action, sprinting down corridors and peppering security with bullets in a frantic escape. The choice is yours.Thumbs up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wasn't sure what to expect from Monaco, whether it would be more arcade or more realistic. And I've come to the conclusion it's a little bit of both.When you open the game, the menu itself moves very nicely, with graphics flowing in the background. Right off the bat, there are multiple gamemode options. I dove right into “Campaign” mode, and, like many other games, it showed me the first mission I could complete in color, and all the others were grayed out. However, what I really liked about playing Monaco's campaign, is that I could join/start a lobby, have up to three other people with me, and could stay in that lobby and keep selecting episodes instead of having to join a new lobby for each episode. The gameplay itself is very nice. You start on the first episode by choosing one of four characters, each with their own perk. As you progress through levels, you gain more characters. The game loads very quickly, after you depart from the neat lobby menu of changing options (which is always fun). It is a top-down game, but there are obviously good reasons for that. On the top, directions will be given as to what you have to do, so that it's never confusing, and the goal is to sneak past the police/guards to get to the object the heist was started for and all the spare money along the way. There are weapons to pick up from time to time, but I found that running away from guards and hiding in a room for a few seconds keeps them off your scent.Pros:Menus move very smoothly.The graphics, being a top-down game, are pretty decent.The objectives are always clear.You can stay in the same lobby for as many levels as you choose.All campaign levels can be completed in either singleplayer or multiplayer.The controller support is amazing, and I actually prefer to use the controller.There's Steam Workshop to download new levels to play.It's local co-op too, so it's good for a party with friends if you have more than one controller.Cons:Gun reloading is very obnoxious. It shouldn't take 10 seconds for one bullet to reload.The co-op community is not as large as I had hoped.Guards are almost too easy to get past.So, basically, I had a lot of fun playing this game, though I would recommend getting it on sale.

What´s this game about?This game is a incredible top-down stealth game with big, open levels, interesting characters with various abilities and weaknesses, each proposing a different playstyle. You break into art galleries, embassys, police headquarters, ships, prisons (...), each level featuring an interesting combination of surveillance cameras, lasers, handprint scanners, locked doors, ventilation shafts, bushes or plants to hide in, PCs and power outlets to inject viruses, and inattentive guards carrying special keys. (...) How much content/replayability?There is a vast amount of dev-made levels, including little text-based briefings. You can replay a level again and again, a different character selection most certainly leading to a entirely different game expierence. It is great fun to collect all coins scattered through the levels (""clean out""), which acts +/- as a optional sidequest.Additional:And then there is the Steam workshop....And then there is Multiplayer, which is almost a game on its own, including 4-player support.And then there are gadgets, like shotguns, crossbows with tranquillizer darts, medikits, smoke bombs, C4 (...) which you obtain by collecting coins.SO: Buy this game if you like stealth, Co-Op action/voicechat chaos, good timing, tactical thinking and top-down games.I give it a 9/10. Excellent indie game with balanced and distinct characters, very good replayability, 4-Player Co-Op Support and the Steam Workshop offering even more old rich men to loot. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is a very fun game: you can play in singleplayer mode as well with up to 3 friends using one among 8 characters with different special skills (yes, it's much more fun playing with friends). Every level is pretty much unique and you can approach at it in many different ways, according to the members of your party. Obviously the stealthier the better. At the end of every level your score is based upon the time you spent finishing the level (that is catching the main objectives) to which will be added a penalty that will be as big as he coins you missed during the level.Artistically speaking, we're dealing with a jewel: your screen will be invaded by any sort of color and the retro style is something simply beatiful.Base gameplay is already various, but it's additionally enhanced by the presence of the zombie mode which is very difficult, even though I haven't played very much.In addition to what I've already written, there are many interesting community levels which can help you learn the basics of the classes and many tricks.In the end: I absolutely recommend this game because it's simply one of the best and deep coop experiences you can find.10/10			",107,23,0,18,14,0,15

												So, single player, this game is alright.  It's nothing I'd really write home about.  The multiplayer, though, is some of the most fun I've had in a long time.  The mix of strategy and chaos is glorious, and it's really easy to crack up every mission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An indie coop heist game.Amazingly fun to play in coop with friends online or on a single screen, though it requires X360 gamepads for other players (max 4 players either on- or offline). Great challenge when going solo, especially with the additional task of collecting all the loot. The game may look simple at first, but give it some time and you should find it interestingly challenging. Definitely for people who like to max out the levels. There are eight characters to choose from (4 during the first missions); each has its advantages and drawbacks, thus each of them requires a different approach and strategies, but in coop they complement each other. Time spent on each level can be compared with other players via the built-in leaderboards. Not to mention the great, full of twists story, the built-in map editor (steam workshop), good humour (guards' voices), good replay value, additional zombie mode and the free expansion which closes the story. There are a couple of flaws, but they are outnumbered by the sheer fun when playing this. It seems like the developers really loved creating this gem. At least that's what I felt while playing it.

												Great game with amazing art and concept.This game will surely bring all your friends together as you will work toegther as one cohesive unit. This game relies on the skills of each and every character. You can beat this game on your own, but it will be hard. Playing single player often gets me thinking ""Having a breacher here would be great."" or ""Man, a lookout stationed here would be really helpful"" which is why playing online is the only way to go.The music, is another plus point in this game. The music has a lot of pace, picking up extremely fast as you get spotted by a guard, or managed to take the prized loot. During sneaking mode, the music provides a spy-ish sort of music.Overall this game is guaranteed to give you a whole lot of fun and a unique experience, be it bad or good totally depends on your teamwork, when working in a team.My rating: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was ""The Perfect Game"" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I checked the game while it was on a Free Weekend offer. Must say it is a big fun, but you really need a team for that. I played it with three strangers but it was still a great fun. At first it seems really ease, even boring. But the further game goes, the harder it gets. At some moment you need a well-crafted tactics to beat the level. try it, it's fun.P.S. Game has a really unusual visual design (the 'fog of war' is designed as a building plan picture), but one gets used to it quickly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The quintessential co-op experience. Every moment of this game spent playing with friends is an absolute joy whether you succeed or fail. The visual style may take some getting used to but it serves its purpose, but what puts this game over the top is the music. The soundtrack is a brilliant compilation of piano tracks reminiscent to those of the silent movie era, and the tone and pace of the song changes depending on the situation, making it feel like your playing a wonderfully interactive heist film. If you're gonna play this game, play it with friends or you're doing yourself a great disservice. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Monaco is all about the grand heists. Robbing casinos, banks, palaces, hotels and escaping with everything that's shiny. A series of levels in which you steal all the goodies then make a quick run for the nearest exit. Monaco is truly a unique take on the ""heist"" genre. If you give it half a chance and more than just a couple of challenging hours then you just might find a hidden gem that is more enjoyable and challenging than many other AAA games that are out there right now.Monaco may initially be written off as just a bare-bones 2D top-down view game, boring when played alone. But I did. And it was great. To me this title is very underrated. If you go deeper into the gameplay and the storyline that stretches across multiple levels, you'll find a game that's both intriguing and amusing. Monaco follows a crew of misfits, with each individual bringing a set of shady abilities to the table. They're all in it for the long con. The player gets to control any one of them on each level, and as they are each and all very different, so is the manner, tempo, and style by which you can play. Monaco has all the characteristics of a good PC heist game:Planning and strategy is crucial every step of the way; if you just jump into a room full of guards you are sure to die in the ensuing chaos. There are many tools of the trade provided however, and it's important to use them carefully. Monaco grows on you the more you come to terms with how simple yet challenging the game mechanics work.Level design is logical, meaningful, and often intimidating. But the game does a good job of balancing skill, strategy and luck for the player. There are often several methods of reaching the objective within a given level. This goes hand in hand with the various different characters within the game, and I do mean everyone. Monaco takes every one of them into account and still (perhaps) manages to balance the challenge for each different style of play. I myself preferred to play as the Gentleman. PC (KB+M) controls are simple, sharp and manageable. Keyboard remapping is also available, but for some reason does not work in the menus. The character you control is always in your focal point as this is a top-down view game; there should be no blaming the camera for any mistakes you make here. The in-game HUD is also minimal and clear on objectives and whatever else needs to be known.  AI is a little difficult to explain here, but like most games the more you play Monaco the easier it is to understand and adapt. The key is in avoiding detection; the longer you are out in plain view of guards and civilians the more suspicion you draw. This suspicion is based on line of sight; but unlike how it is often very difficult to know where guards are and how they will see you in FPS or third-person games, the top-down strategic view here makes things much easier for you to act and react. This level of control really makes you understand that if something does go wrong, then only you are to blame.  ",54,12,1,8,2,0,4

												With a colorful artstyle and a chaotic nature, this is a game where you seem not to know what is going on at any moment in time. Yes, I am here reviewing yet another four-person co-opertative. This is a very strange type of game through concept, but achieves enjoyment through being very chaotic, escpcially when all four players are present for the experience. There are multiple characters to play as, with each one having a special ability that assist the team in one way or another. You can play through the game either through the stealth means or running through it, getting spotted by the security will peforming said action. This video game was specifcally taliored for co-opertative, as having multiple individuals in the game at once is benefital to the success of the operation. If you are trying to play this without being spotted, it is very difficult, with their being a mass amount of security officer and civilans present on each level. There are ways to avoid said obstacles, such as vents and other means of traveling around. The gameplay is enjoyable, with teamwork infused into multiple actions, such as if a teammate was killed you will need to go to revive them and can not proceed without doing so.

												My friend bought me this game and I have never sat down and tried to play it seriously, so I am only writing this at his request. I don't really get it.I say that with a lot of games. And usually it's because I don't have the patience and like to blame other things for my own faults. I've only played it multiplayer, and it felt like there was no real strategy. My friends and I would all pick whatever characters ( I was the Mole because he was by far the coolest ) and would pretty much just run about the stage doing whatever. We were probably only on the default difficulty, and obviously weren't going for any high scores, yet nothing was really stopping us. We would waltz right into the building or whatever, grab the money, knock a few people out, die, get revived, and then eventually progress through the level and win. I never felt like I was supposedly to play differently. It almost felt like I didn't even need to, because if I could play sloppy like this, why waste my time trying to be smart and stealthy?I'm a bit biased against the game, because I feel like I never really gave it a chance. I think if you have the patience to try and play it strategically then it could be interesting. I do think it's a relatively original concept, so it has that going for it. Plus, everyone speaks French so that's kinda cool.Pretty colours / 10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game with well thought out stealth mechanics, interesting characters with helpful abilities (And the pickpocket), and overall amazing sneaky gameplay that challanges your mind, reflexes, and strategic skills.Or you could just yolo it and run through all the levels real fast and hope nobody catches you like I did.

												This game has you and hopefully some other people working together to enact heists. The game focuses on stealth over going in guns blazing, though it does have a variety of tools and weapons that can be used offensively or defensively. The cast is straight out of a heist movie, featuring a lookout, a locksmith, a gentleman that can disguise, a hacker, and so on. If you like stealth games with a less serious side, this is for you!Pros: rewards careful playersrequires planningall characters are enjoyable and mostly viable in any situationmissions are varied and challenginggraphics are simple and self explanatorycons: not many people play anymoresome levels are brutally difficult and frustratingThe survival mode is clearly unrefined and is pretty much dead on arrival			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lead a gang of misanthropic professional thieves through a string of heists in Monaco: What’s yours is mine, an exciting stealth-based action game with retro graphics. Each professional in your gang has their own specialty and it’s up to you to use the right man (or woman) for the job.While Monaco is definitely playable solo (for some of the missions) its real strength lies in multiplayer where you are able to combine up to 4 various professionals’ talents to subdue guards, thwart security systems, and steal everything in sight. The game is also more forgiving in multiplayer, allowing you to resuscitate your comrades if they fall in the line of duty. If you’re feeling unchallenged, there’s also a level editor that allows for a wide variety of custom-made mission that you can make and share with others.As of February 2017, this game’s online community has died off quite a bit, so if you’re planning on picking up this title I would recommend getting 2-3 friends to tag along. Monaco is loads of fun with the right group. ",217,101,1,22,12,4,23

												I've played a ton of this on Xbox, and picked it up on Steam summer sale.  Well worth it.  Monaco is linear.  It is repetitive but it is also damn fun and outstandingly exciting when you pull a win out of your a$$.  This IS a co-op game.  Single player is less mayhem and challenge.  Half the fun is your friends tripping alarms or gunmen and you having to figure out wtf do we do now?  Haven't made it to community maps or level editor yet, but that plus more content is what brought me from Xbox to Steam.  Bottom Line:  get some friends, get some copies and enjoy this great co-op indie title			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Monaco is all about the grand heists. Robbing casinos, banks, palaces, hotels and escaping with everything that's shiny. A series of levels in which you steal all the goodies then make a quick run for the nearest exit. Monaco is truly a unique take on the ""heist"" genre. If you give it half a chance and more than just a couple of challenging hours then you just might find a hidden gem that is more enjoyable and challenging than many other AAA games that are out there right now.Monaco may initially be written off as just a bare-bones 2D top-down view game, boring when played alone. But I did. And it was great. To me this title is very underrated. If you go deeper into the gameplay and the storyline that stretches across multiple levels, you'll find a game that's both intriguing and amusing. Monaco follows a crew of misfits, with each individual bringing a set of shady abilities to the table. They're all in it for the long con. The player gets to control any one of them on each level, and as they are each and all very different, so is the manner, tempo, and style by which you can play. Monaco has all the characteristics of a good PC heist game:Planning and strategy is crucial every step of the way; if you just jump into a room full of guards you are sure to die in the ensuing chaos. There are many tools of the trade provided however, and it's important to use them carefully. Monaco grows on you the more you come to terms with how simple yet challenging the game mechanics work.Level design is logical, meaningful, and often intimidating. But the game does a good job of balancing skill, strategy and luck for the player. There are often several methods of reaching the objective within a given level. This goes hand in hand with the various different characters within the game, and I do mean everyone. Monaco takes every one of them into account and still (perhaps) manages to balance the challenge for each different style of play. I myself preferred to play as the Gentleman. PC (KB+M) controls are simple, sharp and manageable. Keyboard remapping is also available, but for some reason does not work in the menus. The character you control is always in your focal point as this is a top-down view game; there should be no blaming the camera for any mistakes you make here. The in-game HUD is also minimal and clear on objectives and whatever else needs to be known.  AI is a little difficult to explain here, but like most games the more you play Monaco the easier it is to understand and adapt. The key is in avoiding detection; the longer you are out in plain view of guards and civilians the more suspicion you draw. This suspicion is based on line of sight; but unlike how it is often very difficult to know where guards are and how they will see you in FPS or third-person games, the top-down strategic view here makes things much easier for you to act and react. This level of control really makes you understand that if something does go wrong, then only you are to blame.  ",54,12,1,8,2,0,4

												Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.The goal of each level is to go through a series of ""floors"" of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.The game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong.  You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.The game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!All in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!

												6 hours in and I can already tell that this game was a good use of my money.Right from the get-go, I liked it. I have a soft spot for good stealth games, and this game set off on the right foot by following my 3 basic rules for making a decent stealth game:1. The player must always be aware hgow close they are to being spotted by each guard2. There must be many ways to approach one goal in an open-ended level3. The controls must be tight and responsive enough for the player to have agency in the gameplayMonaco does all three things very well: each guard has a sight meter over them which fills up over time, the levels are open-ended and full of extra ways to navigate them, and the player is simple and fun to control.A good buy, even when not on sale. When it does go on sale, but four copies and have fun remaking the heist movie of your choice! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid multiplayer game. This game has both local co-op and online, though not both at the same time.   It's a fun game that can both be played as a strategic heist game, or a fun run through a guard infested building.   It works well as a multiplayer, or single player, and can be enjoyed equally in either mode. Personally I find it best in couch co-op though it can be frustrating.  Some of the mechanics are a little annoying. (sight doesn't work as you expect at times), and a few rooms feel like you need certain abilities to ""cleanly"" get away. But where else are you going to get a mole to dig a tunnel through a wall, to allow a hacker to hack a light switch to disable a security laser, then let the lock smith unlock a safe, while the lookout is watching for guards.

												yea so i went to buy call of duty 2 and some how this came up in my checkout order, but w/e there have been worser incidents (9/11) so i wait 3 hours for this ""Mushito"" to install and at this point my jimbos are pretty keen for a rustling. After sitting in a dark corner for more then 7 hours, i realise this game was infact not a hide and go seek emulator and i was not the king of the jews. Overall if Obama was really black he would approve of this so since im jewish im going to do that in his name. 8/10, would play in spare time - Adolf			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imagine a stealth game where the fun of the game is trying to frantically run away from pursuing enemies after you got caught.  They keep attacking but then you finally escape their search.You plan a heist perfectly, but then it innevitably all goes into the gutter and you half the police force on your tail. The thrill of escape as you steal diamonds right under a guard's nose. The feeling of craftiness as you bypass lasers and kill guards.Now put in 4 player co-op with each person bringing different skills to the heist along with a ton of loot to steal and you get Monaco.

Posted: May 29, 2015
												My only complaint about the game is that the classes are boring. Currently the classes you can play as are: a “locksmith,” a “pickpocket,” a “cleaner,” a “lookout,” a “mole,” a “gentleman,” a “hacker,” a “redhead,” and a “blonde.” Really? No WONDER so few finished the game. The people we played with are just boring. Cliches. Veritable “mehs.”But it doesn’t have to stay this way. Pocketwatch Games can fix this by replacing these classes with cooler ones. Specifically these:We can replace the “locksmith” with “Sasha Grey.” The Sasha Grey class makes money by taking many hard tasks simultaneously (often four at a time!). She takes them harder and faster than the other classes and, though they would cause other classes such vertigo that others would vomit, she, at her limits, would just gag and roll her eyes back and ask for more, and with profanities! This class is like a “tank,” and can take great punishment.As for the “pickpocket,” how about “Jenna Haze”? Jenna Haze has an easy-going, perky personality. She’s the charmer of the group. She’s enthusiastic and energetic, bending over to do almost any task. She also has tan skin. This is useful.As for “the cleaner,” that can be replaced by “Tori Black.” Not particularly good at anything but above average at everything, you can count on her to do basically anything. And I mean anything. Some of the others may resent her non-specialization—but the absolute value of her skills makes her a force to be watched.The “lookout”? Let’s replace ‘im with “Lexi Belle.” Don’t let her quiet, high school girl demeanor make you think she’s not willing to do dirty deeds. She’s the innocent-looking one among this group, and you’re going to need her, because, well, everyone else in the group looks a little…suspicious? I think that’s the word. You’re going to need Lexi Belle to balance that look out.And the “mole.” How about “Jesse Jane”? Having grown up on military bases, this girl has the discipline and experience necessary to get almost any job done (wink wink). She’s a down-to-earth girl; not as sunshine and unicorns as Jenna, but not as hard as Sasha. And she has a mischievous facial expression none of the others have. You really want this girl on the team.What of the “gentleman”? Well, obviously: James Deen. With his boyish face, athletic physique, and blue eyes, he’s obviously a gentleman. Female guards will look at him and immediately become disarmed (of COURSE there are female guards in this game! Don’t be a sexist!). He has an incredible amount of experience for his age, and unlike many of the other male candidates for the job, well, he can play the “gentleman.” He’s also a good team player; he can work with the rest of the group all night long, and in many positions.Speaking of which, let’s replace the “hacker” with “Stoya.” Graduating high school at age 16, and being versed in computers and games (plus being a writer), how could we NOT want her on the team? She’s the nerd, and the most rebellious of the group; the proper answer to “the hacker.” Being of Scottish and Serbian ethnicity, she also brings something exotic to the team. How many Scottish, Serbian Americans have you played with?Now, the “redhead.” Coming out of retirement, we have “Faye Reagan.” Retiring from “the industry” early due to drug problems, Faye in this game gets a second chance at life. She realizes that she just has to focus on being good at what she believes in, which is sharing the wealth that her mind and body are capable of with this team of stars.And as for the “blonde,” “Kayden Kross.” No longer a performer but rather a director, she will be the leader of our group. This Swedish American writes well (though not as well as Stoya) and, with her French husband and partner in crime Manuel Ferrara, we can expect her to sweep Monaco’s rich men. Or perhaps rich women? (Mr. Ferrera demands that she work only with women for some reason if she DOES have to perform) (we’ll have to keep her away from the James Deen I guess). Kayden also happens to be the most beautiful of the group. Beautiful in that she has an aura of leadership.And there you have it! Just imagine all these characters in some Monaco mansion, working together all at once! Oh what fun that would be! Pocketwatch games! Give us what we desire!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine Review - Raymond KTSuffers from the same problem Dungeon Defenders did, in that it provides cooperative play without an incentive to utilize it (indeed in both cases it was almost a hindrance to bring others into the game). Had some fun with it though, probably worth checking out if you're not expecting much and you're just looking for a casual experience to share with a few people. I'd recommend waiting for a sale though. I wished there were more people playing this game. Multiplayer is pretty dead, need some AI bots to revive it.			",106,29,6,13,24,1,11

												This game is really fun especially with friends (even with randoms that you meet online, they are just as good too), since this is a co-op game that is all about pulling off heists as a team, everyone is there to help each other out through the thick and thin of it all. It is one of the best made indie games by far with smooth online co-op (up to 4 at a time) gameplay and very few to no glitches! This game is definitely worth its money!			",346,56,10,30,44,4,31

												Having put 60 hours into this game solo and co-op with an additional 25 hours in creating my own custom mission, I felt it's finally time to leave a quick review. This is a great game for casual gamers like myself. With my short attention span for games nowadays, it's awesome to come across one that is so simple in concept that it is easy to pick up. Missions range from a few minutes to maybe 45 minutes, and it's just perfect.Even when you're done with the campaigns, there is a plethora of custom missions created by dedicated players. Of course, not all are winners, but there are definitely some very fun ones to play with friends.And of course, that brings me to the best aspect of this game: Co-op play. It's hard to find great co-op action these days, and Monaco delivers. I just love that you really have to work together to finish, period. If just one player is dead, you simply cannot progress. It's also fun to have to constantly be saving each other's asses...especially when you have a friend who likes to throw himself into the throes of danger just so he can shout ""WHOOOOOOOOOOO!"" And then he gets blasted in the face by shotguns.As someone who doesn't even play games that much anymore, Monaco was a delightful surprise that will keep me playing as long as the custom missions keep coming out.

												I love the fact that I can go all Jihad and suicide bomb the guards in this game. That's probably my favorite part.This game is one of if not my favorite game I've played. It is hilarious.There is much entertainment value in it, you can play with friends, you can build your own maps, and the replay value is phenomenal.They have two separate campaigns (I guess it's sort of like the same campaign only the level gets bigger and more difficult). The different characters you can play are very diverse (not the bad, politically correct way) and have different skills. The NPCs are friggin' HILARIOUS in their interactions with you and the bush in which you are hiding (but they, of course KNOW you could not possibly be hiding there) and it's just an all around well balanced and fun as hell game.I give this game an 11/10 (because that's possible).

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn			",62,5,0,4,5,0,8

												The game is a fun mix of arcade style grphics with a bright and easily comprehensable control scheme.The gameplay is smooth and ranges greatly in difficulty.The story is fantasticaly crafted and the chracters are wonderfully decetful.The multiplayer and co-op capabilities add a entire new system of depth to the game (and the PvP is a nice touch too)Overall the game is a wonderful single player casual or challenging multiplayer heist simulator.

												Monaco is a quirky action game with a special emphasis on coop. The top-down, stylized presentation offers a lot of opportunities for gameplay and the game makes the most of it. You unlock a roster of characters, each with their own special abilities, and progress through an campaign of daring heists, mishaps and capers.What you need to do is watch the official trailer for the game, then imagine that the sweet, colorful chaos you saw in the trailer actually makes sense after 30 minutes of play and is satisfying to pull off, both solo and with friends. If you then see a game you like, go ahead and buy Monaco, you won't regret it.			",546,285,26,69,45,4,63

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn			",62,5,0,4,5,0,8

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.

												This is a very unique and awesome stealth game. It has a strong emphasis on co-operative multiplayer gameplay, which more and more games are tapping into, and for the better.As a single-player title, it is not particularly impressive. It has its moments, but for a long while, the game is just too easy. Luckily, it has a lot of challenging and fun levels later on in which you'll actually have to play it stealthy.As a multiplayer game, it is one of the best gaming experiences one can have. I think having 2 players instead of 3 or 4 is still best, but all options are very fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to play with friends, and also any fans of the stealth genre (like me!).			",247,77,0,13,19,2,25

												Monaco has one of the most unique gameplay combinations I have played, its filled with indie pixely goodness, but also has a detailed ""stealth"" system along with 4 player co-op and a level editor makes for near endless fun. Monaco doesn't let its art style hold it back from telling a story either, throughout the campaign you will learn about the characters and what motivates them. The protagonists are each there own character with there own ""personality"", something I would think hard to do given the graphical style of the game. I think you should give Monaco a try. Its not an expensive game but it is definitely worth a few bucks!			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												Not really very good.Too fast paced/arcadey for good cooperation and the artstyle inteferes with gameplay. Certain classes are massively overpowered and others next to useless (a major problem in any coop game).Almost everything you can do in the level (knocking out or even killing guards, hacking computers) resets either after a short timer or when someone finds the body and even the players may be revived infinitely. In addition the vast majority of classes are only really given a small bonus to an ability anyone can do. If anyone can pick a lock being able to pick it slightly faster isn't THAT useful.All of this combined makes it much more likely/effective to simply have each player rush around alone than work together to come up with a proper plan. There is no real punishment for losing players since someone else can do the same thing (though a little more slowly) until you revive them again. Sure you COULD play the game as 'intended' but why? Yes, maybe it does magically get better towards the end but I can't see it being worth the♥♥♥♥♥♥before it. Fixing bad underlying design with 'good' level design is not acceptable.The trailer (video on this store page) is completely unrepresentative of how the actual game plays in coop. As mentioned by others (and indeed at the start of this review) the art style makes it difficult to tell what is actually going on and isn't particularly pretty in its own right.Maybe if you put significant hours into it you'll get used to the art style, only play the 'good' levels/play for score and speed etc but that is not an argument in favour of the game. It is advertised as a cooperative heist game (similar to, say, Swat 4 or Chaos Theory coop in design). Instead it is a fast paced arcade-style game with multiple flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay....I'll admit it.   For a long time I didn't like Monaco because it just felt strange to me.   It's an acquired taste (As one of my friends said in his reviews).But after many heists with friends, I must make a confession....I LOVE THIS BLOODY GAME!!!!!It's not too good in single player, but when you're playing with friends, the chaos becomes your new best friend!You can relate this game to a top-down Metal Gear game, but with a charm of it's own.BRILLIANT story-telling.BEAUTIFUL music.WONDERFUL chaos.FUN gameplay.GREAT mechanics.If this game is not in your library, then why are you even on Steam?!If you meet me in a server, be ready for a good time.

												Greatest lips ever. It was as if they had coldsore blisters all over them. Plus, having multiple lips in the same area is not only enthralling but also endearing. It made everything that much more fun. Never sure if one lip would do what you needed it to at the right time, or noticing as a random lip would quiver and the blisters would pop and spray all over the other lips. Coop at it's best. A shining achievement in blister history. I'd give it five full lip blisters and a quarter pus filled sack -- have fun!			",31,8,0,2,1,0,3

												Where do I start with this game? Hmmm... Lets start with how foolish I was when I first bought this game. I bought it downloaded it and neglected it. I was too brash and thought this game was a complete bust when I first played it. After 2 years while I was cleaning out my dresser/closet/cupboard I found a completely black game case... it was Darkness 2. Ok then I found another completely black case it was Monaco. The game I bought 2 years back and neglected. I realised just looking at my gametime that I didn't really experience this game and didn't give it much of a chance compared to my other games. I quickly re-downloaded Monaco and started it up. First thing I noticed, the beautiful soundtrack, I sat there listening for a while just appreciating this captivating melody. Then I actually started playing the game. The mechanics were a little bit strange to me at first compared to games such as Hotline Miami, Hero Seige, etc. but I slowly got used to it. Instead of breaking down doors and killing everyone at once. I had to take my time planning out my way of entry and exit, which character to play as, what to do once I get in and how to get out again once the objective is complete similar to a game called Gunpoint. I felt pretty good when I was able to complete an entire level without raising any suspicion and setting off any alarms. I felt like a true sneaky and sly thief. The games mechanics were pretty much flawless. Each character had very useful abilities. No one was useless. Singleplayer is somewhat completable through some paitence and perseverance (Best classes are The Cleaner and The Gentleman.). There is always a way to complete a level even if things seem a little bit shaky. So it's pretty fair to new players. In multiplayer, it is much more easier and much more crazier when someone messes up and you need to save him/her from a crazy situation (You can't ditch people and just complete the mission without them.). Ok this game isn't perfect but it is still one of the better and balanced games out there. The AI is somewhat lacking. In zombie mode if you play The Cleaner you can just literally go around assassinate everyone as the zombies don't get knocked out but just die. The Pickpockets Monkey range is a bit weak it only steals the money in a very minute range (it is still very useful for laser rooms and well guarded areas nonetheless.). The Lookouts highlighting ability could be improved maybe revealing the guards posts and paths would be useful (She reveals guard type and the infrastructure of the map. Still very useful.). The Hacker should also have extended time for the virus' and that go around shutdown lasers and electronics. (He hacks and fast and can create virus' from the outlets. Still very useful.). The Gentlemans disguise is too limited and is broken way too easily. (He is still my favourite stealth class. He just requires a bit of skill and patience to play as.). The Redhead can charm one enemy at a time but they should add some sort of mechanic that depending on who she charms she gets some sort of ability (So adding to the fact she can use guards to open locked doors. Maybe civilians can add some sort of disguise mechanic.).Alright I'll stop rambling and end this review. Whether people read this or not (I hope they do.). All I am getting at this review is that. You shouldn't judge something before you truly know your judgement is thorough and proven.			",184,16,0,15,10,0,7

What I liked:  Missions start out easy, but get more difficult later on  Every character has a good use, some are better on certian missions ( I liked the Cleaner)  Has mod support  It's a great stealth game, how many of those exist?What You Need to Know:  You would be lucky to find anyone playing this game  I tried singleplayer, wasn't bad, just not the true way to play   You need a good team, because you everyone has to escape, so one person can ruin the gameMy Score:BPaid: Included in a bundleCompleted in: Couldn't find people to play ",224,25,1,13,29,1,28

												At this point in time, Monaco takes the prize as my favorite game on steam. I purchased this game prior to the release, and to this day, I don't regret it. The game is beautiful from start to end. With the kwirky eggs in the game, the stunning OST (as done by Austin Wintory) and the outstanding visuals make the atmosphere really POP. With the addition of a level creator, Local Co-op and online co-op up to 4 people, there's plenty of room for chaos and madness in your playthroughs. While it may not necessarily be the longest game, a second storyline, and online content is more than enough to fill your needs for this game. Although there might be a learning curve for some, Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is truly that anyone that's even slightly interested in the stealth genre would love. 10/10 Would recommend.

 DISCLAIMER:  This is the first time I write a review, so it's not  that  deep and may have some errors. Have fun!Ah, Monaco. The best place to relax, party, and get robbed by a monkey. This Top-Down 2D game is good, I like it, and like any other game, it has it's  pros  and  cons  . PROS: -Steam Workshop.-Steam Trading cards.-Cheap.-Original.-Nice History.-Nice Graphics. CONS: -Gets boring after you complete the game.-Zombies are sometimes too Overpowered.-Limited tiles and tile placement. (If you do know what I mean..)-There's a part in the history that is too Overpowered.So yeah! That's it. What's yours is mine, and this review, is  mine  . RATING: 9.9/10 - Me.*****/***** - Me.A+ - Me.I recommend the game. It's a good buy.			",52,11,1,8,27,1,4

Its a good game to have in your library and when you play... just remember....

												Monaco is a well-made game with nice plot. It is best played in multiplayer, however, there is a problem with it - it becomes too hard to play very soon and levels are very tough. Therefore an average player quickly loses his interest in the game.			",6,1,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game is great the enemy AI is unpredictable the levels have a lot of replay value and most importantly the game is hard the first couple levels are fairly simple but in the later levels you really need to experiment with all the diffrent classes and that's some genuinely nice design because at that point the game changes into a stealth puzzle game instead of just a stealh game this genre was never really something I played a lot mainly because I couldn't find any games to play that were based purely on stealth and decision making in most stealth games you can perform takedowns or other things of that type but this game only has one character that can do that which is really great it means you have to rely heavily on your enviroment instead of the normal hey you've got 50 diffrent gadgets that you can use to not get spotted and take this guy down without anybody noticing so yeah long story short this game has it all the sound design ( that actually uses real life sounds ) the character variety, the stealth, etc. so basically to conclude Monaco is a great game and I would recommend it a lot heck I probably forgot like half of the features of this game because there is just so much to talk about and there is a lot of quality to be found in every single one			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco is great! Litterally when I was just on the few couple levels I was just confused and screaming since I didn't know what I was doing xDMonaco is addicting, really fun and just wow... xD It really got me into the game where you get in the game and it was just going madman! Straight into to game, heaps of drama while stealing + escaping just got really catchy! Doing different gamemodes and such got pretty fun too I mean who wouldn't like this game? (Except for some people) But Still!Single Player is very challenging but being able to connect with 2-4 players on levels make it easier and also fustrating in a good way. I rate 9/10 because I mean yes it's awesome but there isn't much of variety of levels except for the workshop, but who knows how good the workshop ones are. If you are reading this and are about to buy the game or anything. I REALLY SUGGEST YOU DO!!! *Amazing :D*			",19,4,1,0,2,0,0

												oh my, quite a sale....this game was alot of fun, not wiht the random players during its free weekend, but once i invited a friend this game became challenging at later levels and yet a bunch of fun throughout.  failure didnt matter because we were haivng too much fun, especially with the zombie mode.  while you have people on here giving reviews from their barely touched game (monaco), sayign you can run through past secuirty and get away no problem? yeah, that only works for the first few (maybe 4 or 5 levels where you can still get away with a full alarm going off). after that, better equipped gaurds, security systems, and well, jsut about anyhtign you can think up comes into play.  sinlge player becoming increasingly harder while cooperative play leads to perfect theft (gettgin by unnoticed), even jsut getting every peice of loot is a challenge, not reuqired but it is funa dn ive never left a level without making sure ive gotten everything.  perfect for you and frineds online, games worth  its regular $15 price, it really is.  if youre going to miss out on this deal, i jsut cant feel sorry for you.  look up some gameplay online to see if you want it or not but its a great game at a good pricegame has multiple modes and levels, all with great level design, contorls are responsive and teamwork is emphasized through play, it makes everythign alot quicker, less stressful, more fun and well jsut efficient.

												This game excels at being a frantic multipllayer game where if stealth didn't work, run. Alll the levels have a twist and a new perk to them, which makes the game never boring. The characters are great for that extra help you need in the game (I like thee pickpocket, as he can just be in a room and Hector, his mokey, can take everything).You cant anticipate the next move of anyone in the levels, which adds to the excitement and suspense. The music is great, the graphics suit the design of the game, and the gameplay is fantastic.			",81,7,2,6,12,0,12

												I've never really played a game quite like Monaco. It is more about stealth than it is fighting. It makes you think about where to go next because you might get caught. The soundtrack is amazing. My metaphorical hat goes off to Austin Wintory, the composer. This game is a blast to play with friends. There will be the woe of almost beating a level and then dying because of some stupid reason (example: your friend was AFK.). There will also be the joys of beating a level when you've been working so hard and you know that you have only gotten that far because of the help of your comrades. Single player is also fun because of the thought that you're challenging all these people by yourself. While the graphics seem all pixelated, but they have a certain charm.

												I've never really played a game quite like Monaco. It is more about stealth than it is fighting. It makes you think about where to go next because you might get caught. The soundtrack is amazing. My metaphorical hat goes off to Austin Wintory, the composer. This game is a blast to play with friends. There will be the woe of almost beating a level and then dying because of some stupid reason (example: your friend was AFK.). There will also be the joys of beating a level when you've been working so hard and you know that you have only gotten that far because of the help of your comrades. Single player is also fun because of the thought that you're challenging all these people by yourself. While the graphics seem all pixelated, but they have a certain charm. Oh, and the French voices are a nice touch.9.5/10Complete it. ",40,7,0,3,3,0,0

Not sure what all the hubbub is about.I gave this game two shots to impress me but I just don't see the appeal. First I played it with the keyboard online with a stranger and then the next day I tried it solo with a controller, both sessions were about 45 minutes. I came away from both bored.At its core Monaco is a pretty basic stealth game with a silly tone to it. There's a little bit of story before each level but it doesn't take itself seriously nor should you. I didn't see anything worth caring about. The majority of players probably skip it altogether. The guards you'll spend your time avoiding also have a bumbling way of acting that adds to the droll atmosphere.I did like how each character you choose to play as has a unique special ability that enhances their gameplay in some way. I even enjoyed a few chases at times when I did get caught. However, with most chases I never felt like I was in much danger. I have read that many multiplayer rounds devolve into free-for-all sprints through the level with no regard to stealth and I can see why. There's really only two things to do in each level: collect coins and reach the exit. As far as I can tell coins only add to your score on an online leaderboard which I'm probably not alone in not caring about.Without an interesting story, likable characters, deep gameplay or enjoyable goals to strive for I couldn't find enough to keep me playing Monaco.

YouTube™ Video: Monaco STTP Review by Kenuty 

			Views: 63		

			Here is my review of Monaco, My first indie thrown up and will throw up more! enjoy guys, STTP as usual stands STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, my new review done quick, and straight ot the point lol, if you...		

This is a great game for those who enjoy top bottom heist, You have to actually try it to see if you like it or not because the video cannot do this game the justice it deserves. Also coop is a blast with friends, but wild with pugs, YOLO+catchy tunes+Very fun gameplay+awsome multiplayer if you set it up+Great concept, hope to see a better sequel, hours of fun and replayability, change up your path and class- Pugs can ruin game without communication- Multiplayer can be hard to find players, no real replayability except ranking and the path you take- Trolls will mess your game up			",810,183,33,104,81,7,110

												This game is absolutely phenomenal. It's great if you have friends that can play with you, and even better if you can talk to eachother whilst playing it. This game is my game of the year 2013 and game of the year 2014 so far! I love this game so much, but my only knack is the dodgy level editor system. It's controls are somewhat flawed, but if I could navigate it with my mouse then I feel that it would be greatly improved. Buy this game and share it with your friends!P.S. I have taken the liberty of creating a group for our Monaco friends by the name of Voleurs De La Nuit. Please join us and invite your friends to have even more fun in Monaco!			",192,45,5,18,23,5,39

												Probably the worst overhyped game ever made. If you read the other reviews you'll see it's recommended by people with as low as 0.6hrs playtime. So what is Monaco? Monaco is a coin collecting simulator. Imagine pacman, but you've got a gun, and also the ghosts pose 0 threat and don't come back to life. That's Monaco in a nutshell. Stealth? Oh sure, you can stealth through the game. But it's very easy to screw up and set the alarms off, at which point stealth is over and it switches to being one of the easiest shooters ever made. It's just such a laid back game, there's very little consequences for doing anything wrong. The game practically plays itself. Your objective is mainly just to tilt the control stick in the direction of coins then sit back and relax. Want proof Monaco is a poor game? Take a look at the global achievements. Less than 0.9% of people have finished the second act of the campaign; and I'll tell you it's definitely not because it's too hard.It boggles the mind how this game managed to get such amazing reviews as it did; really says a lot about the quality of mainstream reviews nowadays.

												Looks like it could have been a great game. We were looking for a new couch-play title and Monaco is certainly praised for that. It also claims 'full controller support'... Except that it doesn't have full support. It only appears to support 360 controllers on windows :(			",100,14,0,10,2,0,9

												Monaco ... I decided to try this game out due to it being on a ""Free Weekend"" deal. After downloading in anticipation and excitment, I finally had a chance to start playing. (BEWARE! This is were it all goes down hill) OK! After waiting for around 10 -15 minutes for the game to put me in a lobby, which it never did, I thought ... You know what, I'll try Offline Mode, but NO! You have to have IRL people around your house to play. So finally, I don't really have much to say about gameplay and soundtrack, but i bet they are amazing, but i nver had a chance :( pitty			",198,20,3,28,10,0,13

												Hey guys, I know many of you like this game, and don't get me wrong, it's good. It just that... well... it's boring. Don't kill me yet. It's just that it gets old way to quickly. After playing for a short total amount of time, I get bored. Sorry... I don't recommend this. D:			",87,10,0,7,9,1,15

												Probably the worst overhyped game ever made. If you read the other reviews you'll see it's recommended by people with as low as 0.6hrs playtime. So what is Monaco? Monaco is a coin collecting simulator. Imagine pacman, but you've got a gun, and also the ghosts pose 0 threat and don't come back to life. That's Monaco in a nutshell. Stealth? Oh sure, you can stealth through the game. But it's very easy to screw up and set the alarms off, at which point stealth is over and it switches to being one of the easiest shooters ever made. It's just such a laid back game, there's very little consequences for doing anything wrong. The game practically plays itself. Your objective is mainly just to tilt the control stick in the direction of coins then sit back and relax. Want proof Monaco is a poor game? Take a look at the global achievements. Less than 0.9% of people have finished the second act of the campaign; and I'll tell you it's definitely not because it's too hard.It boggles the mind how this game managed to get such amazing reviews as it did; really says a lot about the quality of mainstream reviews nowadays.

												Unbelievebly good! Pick it up if you can, makes a great controller enabled game + has brilliant multiplayer. Get some friends round if you can and play single screen.My friend bought this at full price while we were at his house and we were bored, and it was the best £12 we ever spent. He loved it so much he 100%ed it within a week (normal for him). And then we went back a month later and discovered there were 2 new campaigns!Just seriously, get it!			",206,38,13,34,24,2,36

												This is a single player now. I read that there was a competition for this game but so few people entered it that it was canceled. I could be wrong but I know multiplayer doesn't last long on games like this. That's normally the best part in these types of games, and now it's dwindled down to nothing. I use the word dead to describe this. It's sad but it's true. Unless you want to play the solo missions they're fun but muliplayer was better and its gone now. I wouldn't buy this game anymore not to spite anyone but because you won't get anything out of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played the first levels of the first storyline with a couple of friends. I haven't enjoyed it as I thought I was going to.The game, if you play it as a proper thief, is good for its sale price ($ 2.54), but it can get pretty annoying (sometimes funny, though) if you play it reckless. I would not pay its full price ever.I think I was expecting something more from the hour and a half that I have played. If you think of buying it just consider of telling your friends to get some copies so you can have a better time.2.9/5 for 1.5 hours played.			",17,4,0,2,2,0,1

												This game has potential but unless you somehow get a full group of people willing to play the game it's meant to be played, every game will be people running through causing too much attention to do the game porperly and have fun.On another note, the game is way to complicated. You play on a top down POV but there is SO MUCH going on at any time that it's neraly impossible to see what's happening. You will lose yourself constantly, also basic parts of the game like laser alarms and hacking are just frustrating and random which makes most people just run through them.Try it if it's on sale and ONLY if you have goof friends willing to play with you the way it's made to be played.Alright/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Singleplayer or Co-op heist game"", key word being singleplayer. No. It's not singeplayer orientated. Singleplayer and co-op have the same maps, same amount of enemies, except you're by yourself. I'm sure this game would be fun with friends to play it, but in my curcumstance this game is not fun, AT ALL. It's massively unbalanced. So much so that it's ridiculous, especially when guards can resurrect each other, despite taking a direct hit to the chest with the full slug from a shotgun. If you like a hard-as-Dark-Souls challenge then by all means buy it, if not don't get it, unless you have friends to play with. At least I got it for $2.54			",67,5,0,19,4,0,6

												I can appreciate the difficulty in bringing a quality indie concept to fruition, but that doesn't excuse a game from being compelling. At first blush it's a fun little romp which friends can join in on, but it quickly dissolves into an almost meaninglessly easy sprint. It's a stealth game in which stealth is not required, enemies are not particularly lethal, and your characters move blindingly fast. You can easily sprint through all the alarms and trail every guard behind you on the way in and out of each heist, ignore almost all of the loot, and be none the worse for wear. Loot is needed only for high score, and who really cares? All this without mentioning the abilities that make it even easier, especially the Miner character who literally can tunnel around all the obstacles in a level and walk out unscathed. No reason to go stealthy, no reason to really play, actually.			",252,68,0,43,14,2,29

This is gonna be thumbsed down to hell because my opinion is different than yours and im not allowed to not like it even though I personally cant recommend it and you won't even give me a chance and read the reviewStraight up can't play it. The concept is amazing, I'm really liking the concept but whats lacking is the execution, the art style is just so terrible to look at, I can't tell whats going on, I don't know who is who, when I'm running around in panic I can't for the life of me figure out what the hell is going on. The objective is confusing too and theres a random story or something for some reason. Thats my only gripe with the game, if the game was re-released with a much more simpler, less blocky and colorful art style and make it not so busy to look at like i'm about to have a seizure, then I'll play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, but for my own sanity, i'm not going to recommend it because its horrible to look at in its current state.

												As of now, I can't really recommend Monaco.It's definitely a fast paced, incredibly fun game. It's definitely fun to sneak around, figure out how to take out guards, and recruit new characters.however, there is a lot of emphasis on multiplayer, and, well, unless you have friends, online is pretty much dead. characters that you play are very single strength, so there are certain missions that are extremeley difficult to pull off unless you know which character is good and how to play them well.overall, grab it while it's cheap, or if you really enjoy a challenge + stealth, I can't recommend this game enough.

												Seems like it would be a fun coop game but I just couldn't get over the art style.  It is the worst use of the retro pixel style I have ever seen in a critically acclaimed game. The ugly doesn't bother me so much as it being not functional.  It's a struggle to tell the tile sprites apart while racing through the level: is that a shelf, a wall, a door, or something else?  I don't know, it all looks like placeholder programmer art.   Even after playing for hours I wasn't able to tell what certain things were without stopping and thinking about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Monaco as a whole is a very interesting and fresh concept. However its executed poorly.I never played the singleplayer as it was me and 2 friends (plus a random player) playing together, the multiplayer is insanely unstable, we would barely beat a level before one of us disconnecting, we all tried making the lobby to see if that helps but someone would always end up disconnecting. The game would occasionally just crash anyway.What little time we could play in it, it was fun other than the fact its really hard to distinguish who's who besides a slight difference in colour.The game could be good if it weren't for the instability.

												When I looked at the game in the store, I tought it'll be some kind of a robbery simulator like Payday but with pixel-graphics, also the ""field of view"" (of the robber) looks gives us a modern-oldschool game, wich I'm a fan of. So I bought this game and started downloading it with a big smile on my face. When the downloading is completed, I opened the game and started a match. I was waiting and people were just joinning and leaving and I couldnt start to play. After I figured out that there's an option to play offline, I started the game. The character had a delay in movement and crosshair (I mean mouse) and the gameplay was all about moving from a place to place, collecting some golden things and avoiding guards (Wich is impossible in some levels). When guards are chasing after you, they will start saying things in French and that's very annoying.  Now let me tell you the pro's and con's:Pro's:1. The game itself looks high-quality and makes a feeling of an old&new game at the same time. 2. Field of view looks very cool and makes the game more ""realistic"", wich means you cant just notice all the guards, you'll need to look at them somehow.Con's: 1. Gameplay is same, you'll just need to listen to some convention in the start, and then do the mission. The mission are really boring because the lack of content, you'll find yourself interacting with doors / other things. 2. Sounds are really annoying, especially the one that the guards does.3. A really big amout of levels as a story line, wich makes no sense at all. This game may be cool if it was free, I'd better donate to charity the money I wasted on this game.			",203,29,11,15,12,3,10

												I recieved this game as a gift a while ago, and from around 90m of co-op gameplay, I cannot stand this game, not one bit. I liked the layout of the menus and their bright intense color on black, contrasting the giant pixels to the max.However, the gameplay in my opinion is extremely repetitive, and the game kind of ""forces"" you to stealth the joint.In this I mean how you may have a shotgun, you can go in and blow someone to their pixely skeleton, however note that you can only use it once, before having to collect 10 stupid coins to load another use into your weapon/tool. And by the time I collected 10 coins, I had about 20 stupid Watchmen following me, tripping lasers as I ran, and doctors shooting me with tranquilizer crossbows, which led to me being beaten to death with the deadly forks the Watchmen hold. Sure, you can try to hide in a bush/vent/tree, but by the time I went in one, they followed me to the bush and happened to poke the bush with their forks, leading me to my instant death.The music, in my opinion, is awful, just sounding like an extremely sped up piano ballad, or better yet a 2-year-old banging their hands and arms on every key possible. The graphics are squares. I think everything is a square. Your body is a big square, with a smaller square (the head, which stupidly bobbles left and right any time you move your mouse), and two little squares (the arms) on the side of the big square. Despite this I do like the lighting effects and post-processing. The animations are like pixel ragdolls.. It's strange.There are different characters to choose from, all with different abilities. I thought that it was cool, being able to have a specialty and all. You start off with 4 at the beginning, and get more as you progress through the campaign.Also, I just want to throw out there that if you want to go up a staircase, ladder, etc., you have to ""prepare"" it first, and once it's ""prepared"", you need to wait for ALL players to go there in order to go up. Hated waiting.Overall? 4/10.. Others may like this game, but I sure as hell don't. I'll give them points for originality, but that's it. It's not my kind of game.  ",50,4,1,1,1,0,1

												I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is with the page saying the game has a single player mode, since I couldn't find it. The game was constantly trying to force me to play multiplayer, only options seem to be to play in lan, or via steam friends list, and then to either create a lobby or join a game.

												The video for this game made it look a whole lot more fun then it is. For most of the game there is no point in sneaking as blasting through levels running from guards is less frustrating and way faster. It feels like there is really no point in trying to sneak and make the game work the way it's meant to be played when it's frustrating, dull and the game encourages you to complete levels as fast as possible. You won't be playing as all the characters mainly because it feels like a lot were added as filler and their perks are out classed by other characters.

												A sneak-em-up, top down game which is fun with both friends and even alone.For a while. The game involves employing teamwork and tactics to disable security cameras, steal items and subdue guards. At least, that's what it promises. Unfortunately, it's only too easy to just run through levels, shooting everything in your path, and to forget that the main aim of the game is to remain stealthy. The game is only fun alone for a short while, before levels become repetetive and monotonous. Playing the game with others was a great way to suppress this, until the playerbase became so small that you would have to wait in lobbies 1h+ before another player appeared.A good enough game when it was released, Monaco is now lying untouched in my library as it has done for some time.

												I really wanted to like this game. The setup is perfect, arcadey-style thief game with different classes and interesting level design. The one downfall is the visual language. I feel like everything is giving this gradient glowy style that blurs into each other. Instead of having things be clearly defined they are really hard to spot. I know this game wants you to panic and be stressed out with each situation, yet I can barely make out what's going on. I stopped playing once I came to this realization.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Essentially, there's no hard proof of this game, its creators, or the judges were involved in a massive coverup at the Independant Games Festival at GDC 2010, but there's too many coincidences to just shrug off that this game won anything or got the press it did on merit alone.  There's definitely a nepotistic attitude going on within the ""Indie"" scene since there's a lot of coincidences and very friendly dealings with the major developers of that scene.  I don't want to support a game that's involved in that.			",719,240,13,112,73,10,130

												Monaco is a great concept gone horribly wrong. I got it as part of Humble Bundle 11, even paying extra for it alongside Antichamber. Antichamber is an epic journey into the mind that can't get enough reccomendation from me. Monaco is a failed attempt at a retro looking stealth game about heists. As you start it, it draws a mysterious air around itself, with, I'll admit, a pleasing retro aesthetic. And then you watch the cinematics. They're certainly not what the advertivements show. They're just the characters at hand sitting someplace taking turns spewing out TEXT-BASED dialouge while doing their stupid, 8-bit, repeating animations. The gameplay is clunky, and the retro aesthetic collapses in on itself when you can't tell what's a wall, what's a door, what's a plaza for you to walk into and yell out at the top of your lungs, ""HEY GUISE LOOG AND ME IM ROBB N. YOUR BANK!"" You can't tell what's going to break line of sight, what's going to get you noticed, what's going to - oh, wait, it doesn't matter, because you can just run past every guard, kill everyone, set off every alarm, ♥♥♥♥ up every lock-pick attempt (oops, that doesn't matter either cos it's just hold down a key and boom, lock picked) The outcome won't change, you won't get more reinforcements thrown at you, you won't lose money, or fail the mission unless every single one of you dies. It just gets more♥♥♥♥♥♥easy if you have a whole gang of friends at your side, because then, with each classes game-breaking ability, you hardly have to do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ It sadly fails, with all its' promise, at being a good action game, at being a good stealth game, at being a thriller, at being a good co-op game, all failed. The worst part is it's not actively bad, just plain boring, like a McDonalds hamburger: Far overpriced for the bland thing you get. 3/10			",91,9,8,5,3,3,18

												The game is okay at first. Run around collect gold end level. Most of the people you play with are raging idiots. They either don't try to be careful or they run through the level urging you to hurry up over and over again instead of letting you get a feel for the game. There's also no real progression other than unlocking a few new characters. So your basically just playing for score and i've never really been into arcade style games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My friends and I were looking for a co-op stealth game, and we came across Monaco. Quite generously one of them bought a copy for all three of us. We started playing through the main missions, having a lot of fun sneaking through the maps, silently taking out guards and what not. But then we started to realize that you didn't really need to sneak at all. You could simply run the through the level with abosolutely no consequences. In games like Mark of the Ninja or Hitman: Absolution, you're penalized for being seen, and in the latter even penalized for killing non-targets. With no points system in Monaco, there's no incentive to play it stealthily. Outside of a score, the levels themselves don't feel particularly rewarding. Very repetetive and easy to complete. I would recommend this game to a group of friends who just want something to play together and laugh about. However with no need to communicate or strategize I would not recommend this to anyone looking for an in-depth cooperative stealth game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I did not enjoy this game a large amount at all, got fairly boring quick, gameplay wise very little going for it, and the art style is painful to say the least. I could have spent £1 on more enjoyable things that would have lasted a  longer time, such as a biscuit collection from poundland. On a positive note it had a fun idea and concept, but that is really it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is interesting in it's design.  You select one of a few unique characters with different abilities and attempt to achieve a goal, usually one pertaining to an overarching plot that you uncover as you progress.  Some stories unlock new characters with new abilities that may (or may not) help you during your next mission.  I loved the references and easter eggs in the game.  The developers certain put a lot of thought and creativity into the game.  That, unfortunately, is where the good ends.  The mechanics aren't consistent.  There are times when you can be standing almost right next to a guard who is staring at you and they will not react, even when in LOS.  Other times you can be standing in another room behind a wall walking softly and they suddenly become alert to something nearby (you).  Mixed with the fact that the characters don't have precise controlling (the gun aiming is atrocious), which makes things ridiculous when there are lasers that will trip alarms and the choice between hacking a computer or smashing through a wall is the same motion.  There were plenty of times I was trying to hack a computer right next to a laser and had to frustratingly inch my way up to the console so as not to slide right into the laser (when you let go of your movement key, your character keeps moving a small distance).  With some refinement, I'd say this game would be a most excellent and exciting co-op game.  As it is, me and my friends simply ended up frustrated and just dashing through the level to make it to the escapes or safe zone with no regard to who we alerted.  Needs more work.

												I'd heard a lot of great things about Monaco so I decided to pick this game up.From what I can tell, it's a 2D heist game with a lot of stealth elements thrown in for good measure. Sadly, it seems like I may have decided to jump on the bandwagon a bit too late - looks like everyone's already gotten off. The online community for this game seems to be zero with a serious lack of diehards. Playing this game by yourself can only be fun for so long.I'd recommend getting this game only if you know for certain that you will have other people to play with.			",108,16,1,31,27,0,38

												This game is better than Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I. You can play as the guy with the monkey and pretend that it's Tails and it'll be a better Sonic game than it because it has Tails in it. You can even play with your friends, and with Shrek, but it will be terrible because you won't be able to see jack because the graphics be uglier than Dr. Eggman's armpit. In other words, this is solid for a Sonic game these days but I would advise that you pay no more than one dollar for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first few hours, I was having a positive experience playing this game.  However, as time goes on, after completing missions here and there,   I have realized that  most of enjoyment I get out of this game are depending on how well-made the missions are.  How fun and challenging they are.   Some missions, I can run around attracting all the guards and still complete the missions,  I realize that isn't fun at all.    So I really suggest to restrict yourself to being a harmless ninja and try to loot everything and escape.  Everything else really fall just short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Monaco: What's Yours is Mine"" is a top-down, 4-player CO-OP stealth/heist game inspired by the Oceans Eleven movies. Some have described the game a mix between stealth and PacMan, it being top-down and having to collect coins. PlotSeveral talented people felt they were wronged in their past lives and turned to crime claiming that the world ""owed them a debt"". Inevitably, all are arrested, and happen to be placed in the same prison where they consolidate their efforts. They meet a crimelord known only as ""The Gentleman""; a master of disguise, and are forced to help him rebuild his life after he too lost everything in exchange for a way out of Monaco, France, away from the police, and - finally - freedom. The dialogue is interesting and each character is given enough of a personality to be enjoyable without flooding the player with text. The story isn't too complicated, but it's few twists are enough to make you lean back in your chair and exclaim ""No, way!"" It's very well written and was a delight to hear.GraphicsThe fastest and easiest way to describe the graphics would be Minecraft's blocky, pixlated look. The visuals and art are wonderfully inspired and fun to watch. Same for the game's goofy animations (My favorite being the Red-Head girl's wave. A long, black stick represents her arm with a small block shifting left to right at the top. Another is the ""head box"" of the toons' body sliding left to right across the ""body box"" to look around.) Levels are colorful eye candy without being cluttered and hindering vision. The layout is still believable i.e. desks are in the right places, the insane asylum's layout makes sense and so on. Even the menus are well polished, organized, and easy to navigate. Unfortunately, you can't ""click"" on anything. Sorry, PC fans; it's the age of console ports. Arrow keys and Enter keys it is. SoundPerhaps Monaco's most proud feature is the sound design. From opening shafts/doors, to gathering/using items, the sound design is spot-on. Even when you die, you leave behind a skeleton that can be revived by allies. While being revived, it literally sounds like they are pouring flesh and blood back into you! It's so great!....if not, sometimes a little gross. The voice acting is equally commendable. Although our theiving protagonists don't make a peep beyond heavily breathing when their health is low, the guards are well-voiced and their dialogue is in pure french. Hearing a guard go ""What was that?"" can get old when it's in your native language, but hearing it in a foreign tongue makes the same line suprisingly facinating! However, beyond all this is the TRUE pride of Monaco's sound: the music. While undetected, the music is mostly piano that rouses a combination of silliness, and stealth. The tunes are dulcet with a personality of it's own. When you're caught, the music morphs to a reminiscent sound of Chaplin-esque, ragtime music. Imagine this: you and 3 friends lay out a detailed and complex plan of how to tackle the next puzzle, but EVERYTHING goes wrong! The alarm sounding, the guards sprinting to the scene, you and your team are panicking as you scramble to get away, slowly opening vent shafts and scurrying into bushes while this music plays. It's a feeling I can't describe beyond ""masterpiece"". So rarely does music and gameplay weave together to make such immersion like this. GameplayAll of the above would be wasted on a game if it's gameplay wasn't good, right? Monaco's gameplay is simple, yet brilliant. It plays very ""simply"" but is far from casual. The goal is to take an objective always symbolized as a giant trophy, but you can only unlock the next mission by gathering all the coins on said mission. You have a main ability, a secondary ability, the weapon/tool you take, and sneaking. That's it. Sounds shallow? In fact, it's not. The simple mechanics of the game leave it to be very controllable and follow a tight meta of teamwork. Therein is the brilliance of the simplicity. Some examples are: The Lockpick. He picks locks the fastest (omg nowai??) and his secondary is he opens safes and cash registers the fastest. The Look Out (My personal favorite) can spot enemies with radar-like precision across the entire map. She also unveils ""shroud"" to reveal the level to the otherwise blind team. Her secondary ability is to open vent shafts the fastest, providing an escape route for the whole team. Lastly mentioned is the Cleaner who can knock out guards if they aren't too suspicious of him. His secondary is using health kits the fastest. There's several more, but you get the idea. They are all powerful, yet not omnipotent, forcing a reliance on others without making anyone feel useless. Teamwork in games is rarely captured this perfectly. The online functionality is also smooth as butter. Connecting to games is a breeze and I rarely experience lag that breaks the game.The VerdictMonoco: What's Yours is Mine is a superb display of game design, sound design, and gameplay mechanics. Charming visuals, hilarious and honeyed music, perfect sound, low price, and well polished gameplay make for a game that can't be refused. Monaco earns the coveted 10 out of 10 from me! It's that elusive indie gem we've all been searching for!			",93,5,0,12,3,0,7

												It’s multiplayer-only and there are no explanations.EDIT: Someone in some forum explained to me how to switch to single player mode, and I’ve been able to actually play this game. The developers somehow thought that hiding the option and making multiplayer the default was a good idea. You need to have a gamepad and press START to switch to single player.Anyway, I haven’t enjoyed the game much. Sorry for the lack of details, it’s been a while since I played it. The game didn’t have big flaws that I can remember, except that it wasn’t fun for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The maps the game has to offer requires the utmost coordination and teamwork, but offers classes that don't particularly work well together, and also don't really work well on their own. I didn't enjoy my experience with this game, and I feel as if the game has unrealized potential, but that's how the potential is going to remain: unrealized.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's crap graphics which is to be expected of any indie game.  That's easy to look past though if the game has fun, interesting gameplay.  Hell, even a great story might make it worthy of playing if the latter both fail.This game has zero of any of these elements.  It's not visually impressive.  It's not fun or even catchy gameplay.  There is zero story.  What the ♥♥♥♥ were these critics smoking??Jesus lord this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥  Rarely have I ever played game with friends where all of us, in sync, gave up on a game.  We reached this moment at about the 10 minute mark of playing this attrocity.  You know the PC gaming sector is sad when critics are acclaiming awful games like this as ""amazing"".  ♥♥♥♥ me I wish Steam had a return policy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like Ocean's Eleven on 8 bits. It's a cool concept and the history is OK. But the playability is horrible. Only the viewed field of view is colored and confuses a lot in the beginning. There could be other options of this kind of view. The game is good, but this thing killed the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been looking forward to playing this game since I grabbed a copy during the Steam sale at Christmas.  To say that I feel like I've been ripped off, even though this game only cost me £1.55 is an understatement.The art style is nice, but it's not easy to see what's going on, and very confusing.  I hate the idea of co-op play on any game, but this game is built around it.  Also, there is never little in the way of telling you what to do, and what is going on.  When you start a game for the first time you except a mini tutorial just to get you started and introduced to some of the basic game mechanics.  No such luck here.This game will live in my game library, and I doubt I'll ever fire it up again.			",44,5,0,1,3,0,2

												This game is, without out a shadow of a doubt, one of the most boring games I have ever played. It should have a base price of $3.00, not $15.00. The gameplay is not as fast-paced as one would think a heist game would be. The story is mediocre and very stale. Even with friends, the game is still boring and tedious to play. If I could refund the six dollars I put into it, I would.2/10 would not recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was really excited to play this game after watching a let's play of it, but when I tried it out for myself it was pretty disappointing :( There weren't really any clear rules to the game? You had an objective but the gameplay itself was pretty messy and it was difficult to work with other players. Even joining a game was rather confusing? The lack of instructions kinda surprised me and it really dampened the whole game. In addition to that, everything seemed really repetitive and was pretty boring >__< ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Had rather high expectations about this game and unfortunately, they never reached that level. I think the biggest problem is the messy graphics thats becomes a big bowl of psychedelic effects when you are up to four players. But in the other hand, we probably play the game the wrong way as the game wanted us to play it. Instead of taking it easy so stressed we around in sheer panic. I will give it one more chance, but for now I can not recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												A top-down heist with multiplayer! Was interesting to play with friends, but ultimately didn't hold very much interest. Some of the visual cues (like guard sight range) were a little unclear and when combined with a sparse tutorial I overall felt like I was thrown into the deep end too soon. I could see it being fun if everyone in the group put the work into becoming proficient though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since, I'm fan of heist movies and games. Monaco fullfilled us with chaos and engaging experience of co-op heist gameplay, but it still remain simple pattern and goal. As you proceed so far in Monaco, the more strategies and usage of proper characters are required due to more complexity of maps. The maps are beautiful with classic musics.Only problem is visuals sometimes can get cluttered and confused you when everything is in chaos.If you love co-op games which focus on more strategies and less *bang* *bang*. Monaco is in your mine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun top down bank heist game. Much better if played with someone you know(the lobbys can be pretty empty). Get ready trip alarms and run for the bushes as fast as possible. There are a good number of characters to choose from with fun skills and the game now features a zombie mode so it is twice as long as before. Plus usermade maps for ""endless"" gameplay. Good dialog mixed with some difficult levels but overall a good experience.			",325,80,7,32,18,1,33

												I only buy games when their on sale and yes, this was a great buy. Some of my friends had it and I could connect to them and play. We had a blast. The ai is pretty good - the guards will hunt you until you can slip into bush or something. Then they forget they hunting someone - k - I was spotted by a guard then found a spot to hide and they act like I wasn't even there - not realistic, but without that, I think the game would become too difficult.

												This game is everything I want in co-op. I've been introducing it as Pac-man but stealing money. Its fast-paced and frantic, yet very forgiving in its stealth elements. The controls are simple but have a lot of room for subtlety. On top of this it has a polish you don't expect from indie games. The music is absolutely fantastic and it has Steam Workshop support now so custom maps galore.A warning though, the game loses all its charm to me when played solo. Play with friends or not at all. (It works very well both local and netplay though.)			",328,52,7,27,14,2,30

												Monaco is a difficult game to describe because it doesn't fall into a well-tread genre, but it's part puzzle game, part top-down action game, and overall a lot of fun. Up to four players form a team of criminals attempting a heist, and the game is a race to collect all of the money and treasure without getting caught by the gaurds. It's heavily designed around online multiplayer, and the open lobby system makes it easy to get matched up with random partners in crime.One of the best things about the game is how it handles difficulty and varying player skill. Aside from levels that get progressively harder as the storyline unfolds, success in each mission is less about getting through the mission at all and more about doing it as quickly and effeciently as possible. So if you end up with a mix of veteran players and n00bs, everyone can still do their own thing and feel like they are contributing even if some players are doing more of the work. The time/speedrun system works well for replayability, because once you become better at the game it's a lot of fun to use your new skills to plow through some of the earlier levels.There are eight different characters in the game all with different abilities, and the balance between characters is pretty good so that there are not obvious best and worst characters. Also each level has different aspects that can make certain characters more advantageous, although it's always possible to complete the levels with any set characters. There's also an entertaining and somewhat convoluted storyline for the game that gives each character a unique personality.The core gameplay and level design are both top notch and that's why the game makes you want to keep playing levels to try for better times. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action-y games, especially if you are looking for an online co-op game. Even for people who don't generally like online multiplayer games it can be a good intro into that kind of game because you can start out as a novice and not feel like you're in way over your head. Great game and I look forward to more games from Pocketwatch.			",43,15,0,21,13,2,5

												For me Monaco is the Game of the Year 2013 and it's also one of the best games I've ever played. Whether you like to play games casually or competitively, Monaco delivers them big time. Just when you have 100% completed the game with your sneaky and stealthy strategies you will find out that there is also a lively speedrunning community which tries to push quickness to it's limits all the time and all over again. You cannot even think of how competitive this game is after you have grinded one level for hours just to get that world record. Moreover, if you have friends to play with the fun is suddenly doubled. Planning crazy heists or speedruns with friends absurdly pleasant and after you get fed up with your constantly dying team mates you can turn them into foes in multiple PvP maps!All in all, Monaco is tons of fun and laugh no matter how you play it. It's definitely worth couple of bucks (and it's on sale ALL THE FREAKING TIME) and for me one of the best video games I've ever witnessed.			",169,26,1,12,16,2,21

												Let me give it to you straight, Monaco is a fantastic and lovingly crafted game.  At its most basic, it's pac-man meets Hitman.  That said, it's not for everyone.  It throws out the old way of viewing stealth in favor of a more tense, skin of your teeth heist feel.  Getting caught is no longer time to restart the checkpoint, but merely a situation that you must, and can, deal with.  Getting caught is fun, and the emergent situations you find yourself in are a joy to work your way through.  Perfectionists may get a little angry, as ""perfecting"" a level may require use of getting caught to make quick navigation easier.Where the game shines though, is the glorious Co-Op.  You approach the structure previously chosen to raid.  You plan meticulously.  Everything is going smoothly, but one person screws one thing up.  Insanity and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of fun ensues.If anyone picks this up I'm always game for some Co-Op.  In fact that's the main reason I bothered to write this.------------------------------------------------------TLDR-----------------------------------------------------Stealth game with a dose of uncontrolled insanitySuper fun Co-Op			",352,58,3,28,23,4,37

												Monaco is one of my favorite games, and probably will remain so. From my perspective, its meant to be played co-op and not too seriously. Because it doesn't take itself too seriously. You and three of your friends (or three strangers on the internet) get to run, hide, steal, and generally cavort your way through tons of zany levels. And due to the amazing level editor, the content does not stop when you finish the story mode. Its tons of fun, so go buy it! You won't be disappointed. This game knows that even without the most advanced graphics, perks, or features, its all about gameplay, and Monaco's gameplay cannot be beat.			",78,8,1,9,17,1,10

												To call Monaco a stealth game would be like calling a dandelion food. While technically it is, if you are eating a flower you are probably doing it wrong. In the same way, Monaco is more of a cooperitive game then a stealth game. That isn't to say that it's a bad stealth game, in fact it's one of the best that I've ever played. It just that it's so much better with friends. The best parts of the game are when one player saves the rest of the party and completely turn the hiest around. Even playing online is better than playing solo. So if you are looking to spend a weekend with friends, this is the game to play.			",134,37,0,12,17,2,26

												This game is absolutely fantastic. The ambiance is wonderful, with the music, the guards and NPCs actually speaking french, the vibrant colors contrasting with gray and black, it's really amazing.And the game is SUPER fun, especially when you can get a couple of friends to play with. Nothing is more satisfying than cleaning a place out with a bunch of friends, or pulling off the impossible when saving them in a terrible situation with a combination of stealth, smoke bombs or your character's skills. Walking around the map just avoiding, deactivating the security, dodging guards and running off with the loot, it's all fantastic. Sometimes we start a game thinking, yeah we'll just play a bit, but a few hours later we're still at it. This game can get intense and you just really get into it.If you're wondering if you should buy it, yes you should. I got it on sale, but imo it's 100% worth the full price.			",96,13,5,7,11,0,5

												Alone, Monaco is a solid top-down stealthy crime game, but it's probably at its most fun to  fail  play with friends. I had equal fun running coordinated team break-ins as much as I did arguing with everyone when everything eventually goes wrong.It had a lot of free content like PvP, map builders, and extra storyline campaigns pumped in since its release and it's all pretty good. If you see the 4-pack on sale, I'd try to get some people in on it.			",136,23,0,24,3,0,6

												This should be the type of game I liked. I really enjoyed (and completed) Mark of the Ninja, so I should like Monaco. But I don't, I couldn't force myself to play it for long.The terrible graphics weren't a problem. The missions were a bore. Possibly in multi-player it is enjoyable but in single player I can't recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is just something genuinely fun about Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine.  Maybe it's being sneaky, maybe it's stealing loot,  maybe it's killing all the guards, maybe it's beating the highscore.  Maybe it's failing to do all of them at once.			",50,11,0,7,2,1,1

												This game rocks. You have a couple of guys, they all got their specialty and you need to break in to houses/banks/exhibitions and all kinds of other places. Get in. Get the objective loot, and the coins if you want to get rich, or die trying. Get out. Multiplayer is as much fun, if not more than the singleplayer. I bought this game on the sale with 90% discount, but it has been so much fun it would have been worth my money without discount.			",50,10,0,2,1,0,5

The multiplayer is even better, it can be amazingly chaotic, or among veterans of the game, amazingly coordinated and tight. Evokes the wonderful feel of old movies centering around the romance of The Heist...			",73,7,0,3,16,1,9

												Monaco is a charming game where you and three friends take all the priceless artifacts out of various buildings while avoiding detection of guards and cameras. There are different classes you can choose from, find the one that suits your style. This game is pretty cool with an interesting story and vary people who talk to you in game. Complete with the workshop to continue the game even after the story is over. Also go back to previous levels and beat the record speed. Fun game, great multiplayer.			",71,11,0,6,7,0,6

												This game is well-designed, in terms of balancing between single- and multiplayer play. The former, while difficult, leaves a great sense of satisfaction to the player upon completing a level. It's hard enough to make you ask your friends to play alongside you in intense teamwork-focused action. Aside from that, the graphics and sounds are great, and the replay value is superb! Overall, it's a game with a huge bang for its buck.			",71,6,0,2,4,1,7

												This game is undoubtably a co-op game. It requires teamwork, and if you get the job/mission done nicely, you feel like a total badass.Pros : Cool, colorful graphics. Co-op fun. Easy to connect. Several different playable characters. Zonaco, a zombie version of the game which is interesting. A PvP aspect which is fun if played with friends. Very easy to fun. Never crashes.Cons : Not fun alone. Can be aggravating, but that's just a player preference kind of thing.			",139,16,1,15,8,0,11

												Chaotic fun! Monaco is a top-down co-op heist game where you and your friends use different characters abilities to complete missions. It's a great game with a fantastic art direction that adds to the experience.  Don't get caught up with trying to stealth every mission. While it can be done, half the fun in the game is to set off alarms and distract the guards while someone gets the coins. The game includes voice chat which is good when you're playing an online game with strangers. If not, I stick to skype. Lots of yelling, laughing, and chaos. Definitely recommended to people with a good group of steam friends to play with.			",32,6,0,0,8,1,4

												This game is a game that you sort of have to play with 3 friends to really get the most out of it. you COULD play online with strangers and you COULD play alone but it's simply way less fun.Anyways, tight feel to the game and unforgiving gameplay with definitely a lot of replay value if you and your friends really like to speedrun things. However this game isn't for everyone. It's NOT casual and it's VERY co-op heavy.Oh and the music is great.			",145,51,1,9,1,0,12

												Dumb fun. A heist game where the consequences don't really matter. Set of an alarm? Did someone die? Hide in a vent, hide in a doorway, wait, revive, continue. Different characters/classes allow you to approach things differently but you'll probably find yourself using the same classes over and over again and some are definitely more useful than others. Story is rather convoluted and I lost track early on but that didn't seem to really matter, as the story has little importance once the level loads. I guess a way to approach the game might be to try and do each heist 'perfect'. Or it can just be dumb fun. The art design and perspective used in the game can also make things more confusing than necessary as well. Either way, I'd only recommend on discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its really special how each character has his/her different skills - such as the Mole, the Hacker, the Lookout, etc. (The Lookout is my fav btw, because she can detect enemies in the darkness and from far. :)) How it also has different modes is really interesting - like you could change it from classic to zombie to enhanced and so on. The weapons that you can obtain throughtout the game are also really awesome - like the shotgun, bomb, crossbow, etc~ :D In any case, the background and the characters that are made from large pixels make the game even more intriguing. :D I give it a 4.5/5.

												Monaco on a free weekend, Sure I will try it. and I was not dissappointed.The retro and simplified graphics on this stealth game add a quirky charm. you control a merry band of thieves, con artists, hackers, etc. Each with their own power ups and abilities. Your overall goal, to make off with as much loot at possible in as short of time as possible while avoiding death by angry guards with nightsticks.The story line is engaging, and the game teaches you by playing. No annoying pop ups, no pausing the game. Controls are easy to learn, and you don't find yourself sprawled all over the keyboard.Multiplayer Mode is a blast, you can go through the stories and work together, or go free for all in a race to come out on top.My only problem with the game... Not owning a copy... yet.			",38,23,0,16,17,1,18

Game has many features like a change of gamemode! When you change the game mode, it's changes the music at start menu to match it. 10/10			",27,2,0,0,1,0,0

												I have no idea how this game ended up in my library, but I'm glad I played it! The gameplay is intense but fun, especially when you have a ton of guards chansing you down. The game has a great graphical style, with a fitting soundtrack that you just can't get enough of. And Steam Workshop support pretty much gives this game endless fun. But the best thing about this game is the Co-Op. It's great fun, and I'm sure you'll end up playing for hours. Overall, this game made me want to murder my friend in cold blood, would recommend.
