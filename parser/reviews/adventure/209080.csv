												Before I begin, let me clear a few misconceptions that are common in the negative reviews:""♥♥♥♥ the micro-transactions in a $15 game.""The in-game store only sells cosmetic items such as costumes and ship decorations. You cannot gain an in-game advantage by paying $$$. Half of the catalog can be earned without paying real money by levelling up your classes and doing achievements.""Long waiting times in lobby, takes forever to find/start a match""This problem has been solved in the latest patch with the addition of an actual matchmaking system. The lobby now has a time limit (Forced start after 4 min).""This game requires voice chat.""There is a voice and signal command system accessed by pressing the V key that allows you to give a variety of commands spoken by voice actors. Voice chat is no longer required, especially if you are an Engineer or Gunner as you most of the time you receive commands instead of giving them. ""New players are stomped by experienced players.""True. However there are new player-only matches that cannot be entered by experienced players. New players are automatically put into these matches, although they may opt out of them. Also, the new matchmaking system is effective in avoiding stomp matches as long as there are enough players online.""Balanced matches are hard to find.""This problem has been solved in the latest patch with the addition of an actual matchmaking system, except when there are less than 50 players online.""Poor graphics.""It's actually quite good for Unity graphics. There is 12x AA, water reflections, real-time shadows, dynamic lighting and a post-processing filter available.""Laggy FPS.""This is usually caused by unexpected bugs in new patches that are quickly fixed. ""Laggy Ping.""Low ping is not required to play this game since it is not a twitch shooter. I live in Hong Kong and regularly play with no issues on US servers (150ms ping) and EU servers (350ms+ ping).""Huge rebalancing between patches.""UPDATE 1.4.1: Flamer/Carronade nerf (Most frustrating/Most OP gun) :) No huge rebalancing (only slight) for other stuff. Meta shift because of Stamina and not because of nerf/buff.""Shallow game, no strategy or skill required.""This is like saying Counter-Strike is shallow and requires no strategy or skill because it is a game about shooting back at enemies on de_dust2. In fact Guns of Icarus not only has a lot of high-level strategic depth, it also gives many opportunities for players to show off and excel with their mechanical skills. Examples of high-level play include ship positioning, flanking, ship loadouts, and min/maxing of engineering efficiency and gun damage. Examples of mechanical skills include engineering parkour tricks, reactionary piloting, and using hard-to-aim or long-range guns.

			9 minutes of every engineering parkour stunt and optimization trick you (enterprising young engineer) need to know! The sequel to the sequel that I promised, procrastinated on, and now no one cares...		

The game's long-time competitive community (going all the way back to beta) is a testament to the depth that this game actually has.""Lack of new gameplay content.""UPDATE 1.4.1: New gun, STAMINA SYSTEM!, Steam Workshop hooked up. CO-OP MODE IN PLAYTESTING, IT'S LEGIT BOYZ!""Game gets boring.""If you like the game, appreciate its strategic depth, play with the mindset of improving yourself or simply find and play with friends, you'll discover this game's longevity in the same way people have played Counter-Strike or DotA for a decade. ""The community is horrible.""This question needs to be answered in two parts: trolls and the actual community:1) Trolls are introduced every time this game is on sale. Since they only buy the game to troll around, they leave after a week or two to troll the next multiplayer game on sale.2) I won't deny that a sizeable portion of this community is made up of largely veterans, or that a precious few veterans can get extremely elitist, abusive and salty towards new players. However these people are quite rare and are drowned out by a mass of helpful and friendly players that are happy to help cooperative newbies. ""The game is dead (no one playing).""http://steamcharts.com/app/209080Concurrent players (off sale) peak at around 300. Most players play in American and European timezones. UPDATE 1.4.1: Still hitting 300-400 on weekends, 250+ on weekdays.""No Australian servers.""UPDATE JUNE 2015: Oceania Servers are REAL now!""No co-op/VS bots mode.""This is in the works for 2015. The co-op mode has already been demoed at PAX 2014 as recently as September. 


YouTube™ Video: [PAX 2014] Guns of Icarus Online - Exclusive Look At Base Defence 

			Views: 1,056		

			Chris sits down with Joseph Lieberman at Musegames to get a exclusive look at base defending.		

 UPDATE 1.4.1: IT'S IN PLAYTESTING, HYPENow for the review: What should I know before playing: This game requires a lot of teamwork. Individual skill is rarely enough to win a match. Not listening to the captain's order or recommendations, running around the ship instead of cooperating with your fellow crew and leaving your allies to die while you try and fly past the edge of the map is not fun for anyone. It will only cause your ship to die over and over again while your team loses in five minutes. This game has a steep learning curve. While most of the game's basic knowledge can be grasped within a few matches, the intricacies of piloting, the efficiencies of engineering and the specifics of gunning will take you many deaths and many losses to get good at. Very few people have truly mastered everything the game has to offer even with thousands of matches in game (UPDATE 1.4.1 myself included, hit 2466 matches, I'm a god Engi but can improve pilot/gun). What's really good in this game: The requirement for teamwork combined with the setting and competitiveness of airships haphazardly wrecking each other makes for some truly magical highlight moments, as well as providing an environment that fosters communication and encourages friendships. The game's high skill ceiling allows for continuous self improvement. It feels great to discover something new about the game, learn ways of maximising the efficiency of your ship, or find out how to beat a specific strategy and apply this knowledge in the next matches you play. As you cleverly circle into a Pyramidion's blind spot while you maintain your gun arcs, you smile as your recall how, once upon a time, you didn't know how to accel/decel (R/F btw). JK it isn't that romantic. In reality you'll just suffocate yourself laughing while you crush an enemy ship into a building as your teammate is burning them into a crisp. The huge amount of possible combinations of ships and weapons makes sure that, most of the time, no two consecutive matches will have the exact same ships in play. Also, you can experiment with new load outs or strategies and feel awesome when they work.What's meh: Dealing with unresponsive teammates. In game that relies so heavily on teamwork, having crew members that refuse to change classes, take stupid loadouts and then steal the gunner's gun can get extremely frustrating.Crazy King. Crazy King games... UPDATE 1.4.1: Mode reworked, not a stallfest anymore, kills count for points, if u have more ships u can cap the point instead of having to kill all enemies.Flamethrowers. Playing with flamethrowers... UPDATE 1.4.1: Flamer nerf+Extinguisher buff+Carronade nerf, not frustrating anymore.Analogy using another game: FTL, but your crew are real people.Would I recommend: 11/10 would fly again, especially once you make some in-game friends. There is simply no where else to get Guns of Icarus Online's unique blend of teamwork, strategy, airship flying and crazy highlight moments.			",94,25,1,18,13,0,15

												This game taught me one thing: Metacritic score is bullcr@p! It's an absolute gem with more than 95% of the reviews being positive, and what score do the critics give? 62/100? Are you serious?Yes, it's still not as polished as TF2, let's say. Yes, it's somehow harder to wrap around it, to understand the mechanics (rather unique). Yes, there are bugs and there is an in-game store (purchases are purely cosmetic - like other games like TF2, CS:GO, DOTA2, etc.). But the GAMEPLAY is amazing. You'll definetly need a microphone. You'll need good communication skills and hope to get an experienced captain (or become one). And then, you're set to go. It's loads of fun and it's worth it, both your time and money.Play as one of these three classes : navigator (captain) - one per ship; engineer or gunner. Four guys on the same ship (captain's choice) form a crew. You'll repair and rebuild components, you'll shoot down other ships or just speed past them, you'll flank, you'll use flamethrowers and mines, you'll develop strategies with your allies and have the time of your life doing so. Even if you lose, cause defeat IS imminent. But when you taste the success, oh it will be SWEET!I see people giving negative reviews, but they've played for 1 or 2 hours. It took me 1 hour to finish the tutorial and 2-3 more hours to understand the game playing novice games. Yes, if there's no communication between crew, it's just a game where you run on the deck, hit things with your wrench and put out fires. The whole thing comes alive when you're communicating, when you're making strategies. It's that thrill when you're an engineer and your haul is down, but instead of repairing it you take the cannon and shoot the enemy, knowing you'll be able to bring him down first. It's that split-second decision that makes it thrilling. It's that pre-buffing that you put on your weapon that makes the difference. It's that able stearing that lets you evade or flank, hide just enough to repair or get on your enemy's blind spot with a flamethrower. And yes, you won't understand all these things after 3-4 hours of playing. There's a learning curve, but in the end it's worth it!Also, people complaining about the ""latest"" Matchmaking system - it has been changed. Developers are trying to listen to the players and the community is fun and friendly (for the most part).Some later edits:1. Don't buy this game for your 4yo son / daughter. It actually requires some maturity and sense of responsability to be played. Please, just don't. Rather play it yourself.2. NO SPEAK ENGLISH - NO GOOD! Find someone that speaks your language to play with, don't jump into a random ship with people who can't understand you and who you can't understand and start wondering why you're losing all the matches.3. Respect more experienced players. If you're level 1-7, and all the enemy ships are high-level, you might lose the game for your team. It's frustrating for you and is frustrating for your teammates. Try to hop into balanced games for the best experience.4. Just wanted to say last Satuday I had the best time I've ever had on my computer, and it was playing this game. If you manage to make some friends in-game, chances are you'll bump into cool and funny guys. It's both the in-game jokes and the funny, weird ship-loadouts and strategies that shouldn't work yet they do that will make you not to want to go to bed (even if it's 5AM and you're working the next day).

												This game. Just, this game. I saw one of my favorite YouTubers do a let's play/review of this game, and I figured my friends and I would get a 4 pack. It was on sale, so we all pitched in 2 measly dollars (with me throwing in the extra 2), and we entered the world of Guns of Icarus as James T. Kirk, M. Scotty, Chekov, and Mr. Spock for a weekend of fun (and cheaper than going to see a movie, at that). As you can tell by my hours in-game, I've spent a bit more than a weekend playing ""GoIO."" I'm not going to lie to you guys, it's a little difficult to get a grasp on how EXACTLY to play when you first hop in at the moment, but I know for a fact that better tutorials are in the works. But you have an even better resource available to you: the players. Pretty much anyone who's played for more than a few hours can tell you that the playerbase is incredible. I'm here to tell you that this is 100% true. If you ever have any questions on what to do, you can ask in 'Global chat.' Chances are they will be quickly seen and answered by any random player. You'll also notice that there are a fair number of players in-game with yellow names. These people VOLUNTEERED to help out new people, so if you ever see one and have a question, give him or her a shout.This is also the only game I know of where you can actually play with the developers regularly. I'm just a random player, and I've gotten to know a few of them on a first name basis. Once you get good at the game, it should be mentioned that the competitive scene is easy to get into. Most clans are openly recruiting, and a few even have 100% acceptance rates. Just be aware, while some clans are on a play-to-win basis, other clans are a little wackier, one even has few other goals than to burn everything. And we still see them come back week after week. If you can collect 7 people to fly with you, you're more than welcome to join the big-dogs in almost any competitive event. The game's also a hell of a lot of fun. Thanks for sticking with me through this long winded, scatter-brained review; there's just so much to say, and so little space to say it. I hope you seriously consider buying this game. -James T. Kirk			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus Online, is by far one of the most promising games I've seen in several months.The game takes place in a charming Steam Punk-ish, apparently post-nuclear world, where the few fractured remnants of the human race are battling for territory, and resources. The primary means of transportation over a barren, unforgiving world, littered with wrecks and ruins from an age long past, is by a type of Zepplin battleships, which are built out of spare parts and scraps from various wrecks found on the surface. The ones you experience in Guns of Icarus Online, are the military types, armed to the teeth with innovative, obviously home made weaponry, featuring lots of Gear wheels, and some greasy, messy technology.Gameplay:The Gameplay, as far as I've experience, are primarily a type of Death Match. In a 2v2 match, where two ships are paired against another pair, and a 3v3, same thing, but much more expansive and difficult combat.There are multiple ships to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses...Small and light? Large and Heavy? Armed to the teeth? Favoring defense? Somewhere in between? It all depends on the specific captains style, which is where the really exciting part of this game comes in.This game is entirely unwinable without team work, and here's why:Each ship has a crew of 4 total players.The standard layout of a ship's crew is as follows:1 Sailor(Commander)This person is the Captain of the ship. He controls where the ship goes, at what speed, when, and how they attack, if they attack at all, and when its time to get the heck out. They also coordinate with other team captains to launch flank assaults. They order the rest of the crew, such as what parts of the ship needs repairs the most, and what guns should be manned in preparation for a broadside. The Commander is the backbone of the ship, and sports several utility/maneuvering abilities that can do everything from speed up the ship, to increase evasion and defenses(However, this wears on ship parts, and threatens to cripple the ship if used recklessly, demanding a Commander to be clever in his ability usage, to avoid stressing his crew)2 EngineersThe Engineer is the heart of the ship. Without engineers, the ship would rapidly become a floating heap of scrap metal, and fall apart within a few volleys of enemy fire. An engineer is the only means to which a ship can take a gigantic beating, and still remain functional. They also sport the ability to put out fires, and buffing the equipment temporarily to give defense boosts, minor speed boosts, and damage increase, depending on the parts they buff. An engineer needs to keep an incredibly cool head in a firefight, and always heed the call of his commander, lest he misses a vital repair on a ship part. Due to each part having a cooldown timer after being worked on, an engineer needs to be a professional 'schedule' keeper, and be able to keep a steady, constant rhythm to go from part to part to part, fixing them as required, and knowing when to break the schedule in favor of higher priority pieces(1 engine going out with 2 working, is not more important than a leaking balloon...Cause you drop to your death....)1 GunnerGunners are the tooth, claw, and nail of a ship. These battlehardened warriors of the clouds are the only means to laugh in the face of an enemy's fire and shoot back with a mighty old ""IS THAT ALL YE GOT!?"". They're hardened, vicious, merciless killers, who favor sitting down at a weapon station, and using their expert aim, and large arsenal of ammunition types, to unleash hell on their ship's enemies. A gunner's primary job is being entirely offensive, though they are equipped with a spanner in case their weapon should be destroyed, allowing them to atleast make it operational until an engineer comes around to bring it to full potential. A Gunner's best moment is when they know what ammo type to use in what situation, to out-damage their opponents with clever, innovative use of their chosen weaponry.These together, make a ship, and the most cordinated, best tactically skilled ship comes out on top. It is 4 players, being forced to corporate as 1, collective player, fighting against another behemoth of a collective of players. Imagine the Commander being the brain, and the engineers/gunners being arms, legs, etc.The game permits clans, even preset crews that you can join a match with, to create not just a single crew, but an entire navy, that you can take into battle.You are of course fully capable of customizing your character(Or your ship, should you wish to be captain!), choosing which gender, what hairstyle, what ethnicity, and what fashion statement you wish them to display; Are you a noble sailor of the high clouds? Favoring honor and good sportsmanship, who dresses in proper naval uniform and behaves like a true man/woman of the royal navy? Or are you a pirate, the scoundrel of the skies? Do you dress in rough leather, cover your face in masks, and sport threatening hairstyles, spiked helmets, and a Jolly Rodger? or something completely your own concept!? It is up to your own personality, and more items are added regularly, to both customize ship AND character as you wish! (Dyes(for characters) and paints(For ships) are available as well!)GraphicsThe graphics 'could' be better, but they are still very poweful, and are very demanding, even on the higher end rigs. My best advice, if you're having lag issues, is to turn off Post Processing, it increases your framerate dramatically, without losing too much fancy looks.Also, you'll lag when there's fire. Get used to it!CommunityThis game's community demands to be of a different caliber than your average MMO. Due to the high level of maturity, and ability to take orders, as well as the demand for being able to have an ability to take the game seriously when fighting starts, the players who are trolling/refuse to accept orders, or simply do poorly and decide to screw around rather than play the game, thereby ruining the fun for the others? These people don't last long, as griefing/trolling is considered extremely tabboo in this game. Due to this, the game's community sports a far higher number of reasonable, mature, adult individuals, who are courteous, and friendly.Developers:Muse has gained a new level of respect from me. They are engaging, and listen to the playerbase, without mindlessly giving into them. They have fun-loving, but still mature and talented employees, who consistently log ONTO the game, and permit people to not only hang out with them, but to even play the game with them! They are even offering events where you can test yourself against them for a chance to win free stuff, should you beat them!Progression:Progression in this game is quite strange. First of all...Levels? After level 4, levels no longer matter! Between level 1 and 3, you are a 'novice' player, which means some harder aspects of the game are turned off, to avoid you making progression impossible for you(Such as customizing weapon setups, and some harder to use ships). Upon reaching level 4 with ANY type of crew, be it sailor, gunner, OR engineer? These limits are lifted, and the game opens up its highest difficulty in all its splendor.However, after you exit Novice mode? Levels are no longer anything but a bragging rights number. There are no skill trees, which set you apart from others by building the 'best build' for whatever patch you play in. THere's no 'gear' that makes your ship better or worse than the other, depending on what they have equipped. The only means of 'progression' you have? Is your own skill, your own experience, your own capabilities. You rely ENTIRELY on -yourself-, not a 'talent tree' or 'hot bar' with 'specced skills'.This is all why, this game is worth it. Come play it with me, come serve me aboard my ship, and I'll see if you're worthy of serving under me ;3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR at bottom.-Do you enjoy intricate team based gameplay, where you need to trust in the skill of your allies?  -Do you enjoy relatively easy mechanics that are tough to master? -Do you fancy yourself a leader, that likes to communicate and see his orders carried out by real people?-Do you love a game with a close tight community, where people follow the rules and everyone is willing to teach you?If you said yes to any of these Guns of Icarus has a place for you.-Do you not like having non transparent game mechanics? ( engines below 50% im looking at you )-Do you not enjoy getting absolutely assblasted by people at the top tier of gameplay when you yourself are new?-Do you not enjoy a shallow tutorial? Leaving your woefully unprepared at your class job ( Pilots )-Do you not like NOT having an option to remove disruptive persons from your ship without having to remake a lobby?If you said yes to any of THESE things.  Your early adventures into Guns of Icarus are going to be a nightmare. Beware this is not a game that you will enjoy, on your own, with no friends, to help guide you into things. Although to be fair, the community is always willing to answer questions and help you learn.I have played this game at the highest tier of play, as Pilot, Gunner, and Engineer.  Theres almost nothing else like this game out there. Its intoxicating. Knowing that your ship is a well oiled death machine of personal indiviual skill AND complete trust in your companions. When I play with my clanmates,  and we get matched up against other clans of equal footing, its indescribable.  Sticking through the learning curve and getting to that lvl of play takes honest time effort and repition. When I play for fun ( which is all I do nowadays ) I find that matchmaking is underperforming, claiming that a hidden MMR rating is used to match me up against people that have had this game for a couple days, whereas I've put over 1000 hours into this game. DISREGARD ALL PRETENSE OF MMR in public lobbies. There is none or near enough as to make no difference.  If you buy the game, find a clan of people that seem friendly and play often. and just learn the game from them.  There are weekly and bi weekly tournaments that are streamed on Twitch, Community fights VS the Developers where the winners get FREE item choice from the store ( pretty awesome tbh )Almost forgot the steam workshop, where player created items are hand picked by the community to appear in game, if your creative. You could put your hand to work designing cosmetic items that could charge for or let go up for free. Its your choice.  In my opinion the process of created work waiting review VS getting it into the game takes way too long. Some of these created icons look simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and need to be in the game right meow.Gonna wrap this up before I start rambling. TLDR: -New players are going to suck for a DAMN LONG time unless you get knowledge from higher lvl players.-Hard to enjoy on your own, que with friends. -This games community is the best I have ever encountered in 14 years of video gaming. ( besides new players spamming dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥in global, I promise you they are the minority )-Easy to learn, difficult to master mechanics, ( when charged ammo is better in a mortar then greased ) -Community events out the♥♥♥♥♥ Get free stuff.-The top tier of gameplay is deeply rewarding on a personal lvl, and the memories of your triumphs will go with you to the grave. This is just my TWO SILVER CENTS. that I decided to leave because I hate seeing stupid reviews saying Oh dis gaem is best buy it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How could I possibly summarise over 2000 hours of gameplay into a review?  I think it's the teamwork aspect that creates the social aspect of this game that doesn't exist anywhere else along with the depth in strategy created by the ship designs that keep this game fresh.  Also, the mine launcher.I'll try to remember to update this review when I hit 3000 hours.			",54,37,0,3,9,2,8

												Captain's Log: Day 63My gunner still won't fire at my intended target. No matter how obvious I make my intentions, he insists on firing at random objects, be it a neutral bridge, a mountain, or our ally. I feel he's doing this in a petty attempt at attention.My senior engineer will not repair a damn thing, and is passing off bad habits to the rookie. He insists on repairing guns we never use, refuses to put out fires, and never rebuilds the engines that he's let fall into disarray. I'm beggining to wonder if the man suffers from some undiagnosed mental illness.The rookie, for his part, knows absolutely nothing.Gunner's Log: Day 63My captain is a horrible pilot, and never brings me in range of my targets, then insists that it is a result of my horrible aim and lack of attention. I'm half tempted to attempt a mutiny, to overthrow her tyrranical rule, but I know the engineers are too weak willed for such a task.Our senior engineer seems content to stare at our engines while they are on fire, rather than attempt to extinguish them, and it is horribly annoying. I'm getting the feeling that he doesn't wish to fly on this vessel, and is attempting to bring us all down with it.As for the rookie, I'm getting extremely tired of having to reload my ammunition because he's replaced it with some obscure new bullet type.Senior Engineer's Log: Day 63My captain is driving me insane. She has no empathy, and refuses to give me a commendation for my hard work. She expects me to be at every position at once, and will not hear it when I suggest we attempt to retreat for a few moments to repair our ship.The gunner is being a jerk, as usual. He still doesn't believe that my fire extinguisher is broken, and won't stay at his gun while he has a perfectly good shot at the enemy. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ needs to stay at his own station, before he breaks something while attempting to fix it.The rookie is useless. He never listens, and insists on trying to use guns that could not possibly be aimed at our opponents. Why am I always stuck with the incompetent crews?Novice Engineer's Log: Day 63After careful observation, I've concluded that nobody on this crew knows a damn thing about their job.

												A truly great concept for a game, lots of content, gameplay heavily based on co-operation between each player, regular updates with even more content, devs interacting with their player base on the global chat, suggestions and feedback really matter, friendly community with lots of lil' helpers. Despite it being a quite niche project thing for now, it's a great alternative to the current video-games market *cough*callofduty*cough* 11.24.2016 EDIT A lot has changed since I posted my review - the game got even more content, a lot of gameplay aspects received polishing and now a whole new Mode is about to be released. I don't play as much anymore, but can definitely recommend it if you like steampunk and communication.			",53,4,0,4,4,0,0

												Lobby Simulator Online.The only way to win, is not to Ready.------------------------------------------(Slightly more) serious review:The game is awesome, the concept is pretty unique. Yes, graphics are nothing to write home about, but the gameplay makes up for that and more.Do you want to bludgeon ships out of the sky with brute explosive power? Check. Do you want to harass them, pop their balloons, and then sit on top of them and grind them into the rocks? Check. Or maybe you just want to go full flamethrowers and toast them like a flying marshmallow. Check that too.Do not buy this if:You hate teamwork.You don't speak English.You don't have a microphone.Seriously, don't. Because not only will you get very little out of it, and hate the game, everyone you fly with will hate you too.DO buy this game if:It sounds awesome (because it is.)You want to boost the community count (seriously only 359 people playing on a Saturday? We <3 new players.)You don't give a crap about Metacritic ratings (64? Was the reviewer drunk?)It is worth noting that your ingame name is not tied to your Steam name. You will need to coordinate with your friends if their ingame names differ from their Steam names.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Especially as female gamer in a voice chat centered game, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I usually played games where I could avoid being identified as a woman, obviously, because video games are still a very hostile environment for a female identified creature.Guns of Icarus surprised me.Maybe because it's a team effort game.Maybe because valuable exchange of information and getting along is the only way to make any progress at in GoIO all.Maybe because the developers are actively engaging with us constantly.Or maybe because it's hard to single people out, since everything stays a group effort or a collective failure.This game has been proven over and over again, to be about teamwork and helping each other out.Never have I seen a community welcome beginners so warmly, teaching newcomers is almost exciting to us. I have seen experienced players leave a full lobby, just to show a new player the ropes in the Practice Match (called Sandbox), and I am very proud to admit to be one of them.If you are gonna start this game you are gonna make a lot of friends.That's not a warning. That's a treat!If you are a fellow female gamer, new to this game, feel free to add me and I'll introduce you to the other Girls of Icarus :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus Online is a different type of FPS. It is warfare in the sky between ships that resemble pirate ships (somewhat). Ships battling other ships, all being held up by hot air balloons. Steampunk at its' rawest.Let's summerize the classes:  -------First: The Gunner, the one who operates the main offensive guns on the ship.  -------Second: The Engineer, the one who goes around the whole ship repairing each part of the ship (Hull, Engines, Guns, Balloon, etc...).  -------Third: The Pilot, the one who maneuvers the ship forwards/backwards up/down, and who usually captains the crew. (Though the pilot doesnt neccesarily need to be the captain; a gunner could be the captain telling the other players what to do, including the pilot).With all this being said, there are a few options for different types of gameplay. I prefer to be a gunner. But if you're the type who doesn't think they're very good at shooting accurately, there's the option of being an engineer or a pilot. Being an engineer is probably the most demanding job on the whole ship, which is why there's usually one Pilot, two Engineers, and one Gunner. Most of the friends I regularly play with prefer to be engineers, they are never idle, always doing something (unless the ship isn't engaged in battle and is fully repaired).If you do not like the stress of having to run around in first-person/third-person keeping everything in good condition, or if you don't like having to have the burden of being the one who HAS to take down that other ship before it takes your ship down, then you're probably going to choose the pilot.The Pilot is in control of a lot during battle, he has to keep the ship in the right position for The Gunner to be able to turn the guns enough that the other ship is within range, but he also has to move around in a way that makes it hard for the other ship to shoot at you. Personally, if I didn't mainly play a gunner I would probably play the pilot. Being in control of the ship is really cool, and fun, very fun (and hard as hell).The gamplay is pretty amazing to say the least. The three-dimensional battlegrounds make for very interesting use of the Unity Engine. The crews are made up of four. Games can be score based or time based, with different modes (King of the Hill, Crazy King, Deathmatch). Battles consist of Team Red and Team Blue, and go from 1 ship vs 1 ship to 4 ships vs 4. That's 32 players.So if you enjoy a variation from the mainstream/generic FPS, one that involves a warm online community that is friendly and active and willing to teach, and if you enjoy interacting with real people across the world through your mic, this is definitely a game for you.Just go buy it. Right now, you will not be dissapointed, there's something in here for everyone.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. ",625,160,19,61,32,3,48

												Ignore the Metacritic scores - most of those reviews were based on the beta, not the finished product.The game has a bit of a learning curve and random pub-games might not be much fun, but most of this comes down to communication - communication is vital in this!  The pilot needs to know when the gunner doesn't have a clear shot, engineers need to be alerted to critically-damaged sections of your ship and everyone needs to let everyone else know where the enemy is.Once you get past that; the game is a sheer blast to play!  Hammering an enemy vessel with rockets and seeing his engines and balloon fail, knowing that he'll be dead in the air until his engineers fix everything and giving you a chance to reload and come around for another pass.  The whole team frantically trying to keep the engines and balloon running as the pilot tries to get you the hell out of dodge.  An excuse to shout things like ""Enemy off the port bow!"" in accents and with overacting that would make BRIAN BLESSED seem sedate!  What's not to love?			",126,30,1,18,12,4,22

												The most teamwork oriented game ever created, fly, fix, or fight, your way to victory aboard several varied airships as a Pilot, Engineer, or Gunner class. Each with their own uses but all needed working in synergy to win. Not to mention the outstanding community and the fact that the Devs take an active part in things also.Pretty much Mic required, since good communication is a must.			",181,10,2,17,11,2,22

 A GoI-Veterans ImpressionAs you can tell by looking at the 4 digit number above this post, this game has entertained for quite some time already and I will likely stick to it a while longer. The learning curve for Guns of Icarus is quite steep, but once you get the hang on it you will be able to enjoy the tactical depth and the rich variety this game has got to offer to its full extend. I for one can state that Guns of Icarus is the best game I've ever played since I've picked up videogaming about two decades ago.I think what I like most about this title is the strong Teamplay focus. Guns of Icarus encourages you to run the ship like a well oiled machine by coordinating yourself with your fellow crewmates. As communication is the key to success in this game, a large fraction of the player base talks via microphone or is at least active in text-chat. As everyone on your ship is forced to play WITH you for the better or the worse, tips and gameplay-relevant info is commonly shared through these channels. Perhaps as a result of this GoIO has got the friendliest and most communicative game-community I've ever encountered.Another aspect I really like about this game is the rich variety of loadout option you've got for your ships. Right from the start everyone has got access to a large arsenal of ships and weapons which can be combined by the captains as they see fit. Depending on your own fleets loadouts and the  enemy fleet you encounter, you have have to adjust your playstyle, which ensures the game stays interesting in the long run. Sometimes the best way to engage an enemy is a straight rush to their position to force them into close and personal brawl engagements. In other Situations such tactics are doomed to fail and you might want to to stay back isntead as you've got the upperhand on mid or long range engagements. Sometimes it's a good choice to pick weapons which allow to kill your opponents as quick as possible. In other situations you might want to mix in a ship which is really good at taking out key components like weapons or balloons instead, even if this implies it isn't as good at delivering the killing blow.To enjoy Guns of Icarus you will need to be able to understand spoken english. As mentioned previously, communication is a key-element of this game and english is the lingua franca. There are a few sub communities which speak different languages, but if you want to hop into the game without previously setting something up, it's very unlikely you will find a ship which is filled with french/german/russian speaking people.

												I love this game. Guns of Icarus is an incredibly unique game that is best played with friends.   You won't find another game quite like this one.Now why am I not recommending this game?Guns of Icarus Online launched three and a half years ago.  With that time, Muse has introduced one new ship, a couple of maps, and as of patch 1.46, another PvP mode.  Oh and cosmetics for ships.  They have been very focused on the tutorial system, which is great to bring in new players, but offers no longetevity of play.I understand that Muse is not a triple A developer and Guns of Icarus is an indie game, but development time has been at an absolutely agonizingly slow pace.  They spent a good amount of money hiring youtubers to play their game which brought in a surge of players for all of a month before the active player count crashed again.  Muse also incorporates cosmetics on a regular basis, which is a great way to nickle and dime the player base, but doesn't add any new content to play.This game still has huge potential and I hope that Muse can turn it around with the release of the Alliance DLC, but as of now, I would not recommend picking up this game.EDIT 6/1/2016In response to some of the comments and hate mail that I've received:The game being three and a half years old does not constitute my opinion on this game.I'll say it again: I love this game.  I've shared many fun hours with friends playing it.I am disappointed with the game because it has vast amounts of potential that I don't think have been realized yet.  The Alliance DLC gives me a lot of hope for the game and when it releases, I may change my recommendation.I'll even break it down into a list form:PROS Unique, team based play Active developer involvement Balanced and varied ship and gun types Steam workshop items included in the gameCONS Lack of new ships, maps, and game modes since launch Very small player base Unbalanced matchmaking (often due to small player base)In response to Keyvias:I have definitely gotten my money's worth from the game.  Almost 200 hours of game time for a $10 investment is a fantastic return for entertainment.  I feel like the game has not lived up to it's potential, yet. Integrating new ships and maps at a steady pace (even through paid DLC) would keep the current player base active and help attract new consumers.  The clan that I was a part of had a solid 50 active members at its peak, but people stopped playing because the game never changed.  The joke we had was: ""Hey who wants to play deathmatch on Dunes for a couple hours?"" because that option came up almost everytime we voted.   When the Mobius and later Hades cannon were released, we were very enthusiastic and people started playing again.  There was more variety to play and the game didn't feel so static and stale.The only way to affect change is to state honest opinions.  At this time, I would not recommend this game due to the aforementioned reasons.  In a reviews page full of thumbs up, I think it is fair to state a negative opinion in order to help gamers decide on whether to buy or not.  You have to take the good with the bad.

Pros:+ Almost everyone in the player community is completely mad in a delightful way.+ There's a steep learning curve but once you get the hang of something (a ship, gun, ammo type, role etc) it feels great.+ The soundtrack is subtle and atmospheric.+ Lots and lots of customisation for ship and crew loadouts.+ Teamwork really is the core of this game.Meh:= While there are a variety of maps, they quickly become repetitive.= The game modes also become repetitive, although this is mitigated greatly by the variety of loadouts. I've seen users band together to improve this by creating their own rules such as escort missions (agreeing beforehand that the loser will surrender). Hopefully the new Adventure mode will remedy some of this.= The lobbies can take awhile to fill. This is getting better, though.Cons:- Lag spikes are a problem, especially when your ship is an inferno. OTOH, you can use this to your advantage by setting other ships on fire (Captain: ""Quick! Reduce their framerate!"")- Very very rarely you run into the type of player who thinks they literally are an airship admiral and cuss out their crew accordingly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Your armor drops, health soon to go fast. Engineers desperately clamor to rebuild what they can to buy every second of life they can squeeze out of their wrenches. Gunner twitches anxiously for the enemy's armor to drop to unload that blessed lochnagar heavy flak. Looks like he'll be waiting a while longer. Pilot's dodging what he can, ducking and diving between buildings hoping for an escape, but the foe's just too persistent. Things are dire now. Seconds left to say your prayers at best.Then the hwacha hits. A steady stream of brilliant explosive rockets slams your pursuer's guns and engines with the only kind of divine retribution 24 explosive rounds understand: The good kind. You don't know where your ally came from, and right now you couldn't care less. You've found your opening. Engineers to the spare gatling guns, topping off the hull can wait. Ally turns his side to lend a gatling gun of his own. Doesn't take more than a second for the once-ruthless pursuer's armor to drop. Gunner's patience finally pays off as he fires his lochnagar-loaded heavy flak. The second it takes that round to fly to its target might as well have been an eternity. Boom. One shot square in the unprotected hull and the ship crumbles. Job's not over yet, though.One enemy left, lamenting his ally's over-extended pursuit. Your prayers were answered. Let's see about his.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's such a shame that so few people come around to try and learn to appreciate Guns of Icarus.I find it really hard to enjoy non-coop multiplayer games these days. It seems like competition and rankings is all they're about now. Getting in a matchmaker, being thrown out there against a couple of faceless opponents you're never gonna see again, have a minute or two to pick your champ/hero/loadout/whatever, go. No wonder communities go to♥♥♥♥♥♥if you don't even have a moment to think about the fact that those other players are actual human beings.But GoI? It's just different. And I couldn't even exactly tell people why, at least not without wasting a couple of paragraphs overanalyzing every single aspect of the game and my own personality. Somehow it manages to take away all the angst, salt and frustration that usually comes with multiplayer (well... most of the time). Instead of always competing in some sort of league where everyone is his own overzealous soccer mom, it feels more like a nice evening at a board game bar, playing with some friendly strangers, not so much against them.Guns of Icarus is something that very few multiplayer games can call themselves in my opinion. A thing I can only describe as ""comfy"". Something I haven't experienced like that since way back when I would spend my whole time playing WCIII fun maps with random people and I'm so glad to have found a game that could give me that again.If recent multiplayer experiences just don't really seem to do it for you anymore absolutely give this game a try! Maybe It's just what you need!			",64,7,0,9,8,1,6

												Where to begin?! Well lets start with, this game is PvP orientated, but, levels mean nothing, just how much experience you have, the kit everyone has access to is all the same, it's just how well you use it that counts!The biggest part of using your kit, is team work!Each ship can have a crew of 4 people, Pilot who is often the captain and three crew members (2 engineers and a gunner) and its the crews job to keep that ship up, Voice comms is pretty much a must, unless you're an awesome typist or learn the ingame key bindings! Then there is the added bonus, team captains can communicate in battle, allowing for battle tactics to be planned out!This means more ofen than not, clans will dominate the game due to using the same tactics, discussed before the battle. There is no OP weapon or OP ship, just Team work and good communications! If someone is dieing too quick, someone was doing something wrong, or people were not communicating well! Remember, too much communication can be a bad thing too sometimes! :)The best part of it all, the community is mostly awesome guys and girls with very few bad eggs. Often the bad eggs are solo players who don't like to play their part, or want all the credit and as you can imagine, they'll not get far in this game! :o My personal experience in this game, I started as an engineer as it's often needed and reletively easy to pick up, but during one battle our ship captain went afk so I took the helm while our main engineer gave me an emergency flight school, in the middle of a fire fight! The fight was tough, tensions were high on all our team as I learnt my way around the helm of someone elses ship, but in the end, we succeeded! We played two more rounds together that night and now, thanks to that one guy, I have about 8 people who request me to pilot ships for them and their friends to be the final componant of a good crew! Last night by request to be a pilot of the crew and we had a 7 match win streak out of 8 matches! A captain is nothing without his crew, so don't treat 'em mean! The gameplay mechanics take a bit of learning! Read through the tutorials carefully and don't be scared to let your crew know you're new and may needs tips when you come to join fights! You'll be surprised how many people will go out of their way to teach new players how to do well!Would I recommend this game?Why are you not playing it already?!Stop twiddling those thumbs lad! There's a war to be won! Pack your goggles and bow-tie, Pick up that spanner, hammer and spyglass! It's time for some adventures! Tales of daring do! Tally Ho!Additional Note: Still playing after nearly 900 hours and still thoroughly enjoying it! ",59,7,0,10,11,0,4

But, given the state of affairs with the game, i cannot recomend this game to anyone new.

												This is a multiplayer game, the experience will therefore always be dependent on other players. It is a very teamwork-focused multiplayer game at that, so your teammates will probably have a huge impact on your enjoyment of the game, the optimal way of playing is therefor with a couple of friends.That said, this game is unique and very entertaining combat game. The various functions take a while to learn, so play the tutorials and stay in noob matches when you start out, but this makes it all the more satisfying when all the factors click and you down that galleon. With entertaining gameplay, frequent updates and a developer that listens to the users, I cannot recommend this game enough. Go play it with your friends.			",496,217,15,116,80,4,119

												OK. im not even going to try and explain why this is good. just look at it. LOOK AT IT. multiplier team death match in four player controlled air ships. ♥♥♥♥ing air ships. this game is one of the most enjoyable multiplier games i have ever played. if you think you can just pick it up and go with out having to really talk to any one, good luck with that. this game takes a lot of communication but the community is so good that it doesn't even matter. so pick this game up, grab some friends, and rule the sky's. also the single player is coming and when its here, this may be one of my favorite games on steam.

												Floating warships duking it out in the skies of an apocolyptic wasteland. All in awesome steampunk fashion!4 man crews, 7 different ships, 17(ever expanding) weapons to outfit them. Flamethrowers and mortars and mines, oh my! Ships that range from hulky Galleon tanks, to fast and nimble Squids. Come in loud and proud, or pester the enemy to death. There's a good variety to have fun with.A simple concept, it's easy to learn but hard to master. It's class based: pilot/engineer/gunner.Ships have predefined weapon placements, but you're free to select what weapons to fit(depending on if its a heavy or light weapons spot).-Pilots do nothing but fly and bark orders! :D -An Engineers job consists of repairing/rebuilding/extinguishing fires/upgrading components, and sometimes spotting hostiles. -The Gunners class is self-explanatory, but will often overlap with Engineers duty. But, it's unique because youre allowed to choose 3 different ammo types, which can be invaluable if you learn how to use them.+Now all classes have stamina that give them unique abiities!There are several components aboard evey ship; balloons, engines, weapons, and the hull. They can all be damaged and destroyed by an enemy. You learn what parts are priorities, or when you need to shoot instead of repair. It's very important to know what weapon and ammo type to use at any given time. This is the skill of the game, this will all ultimately decide the fate of a battle. When it all works out, it's an experience that leaves you feeling satisfied.The weapons are all fantastic and totally diverse. Some will trade off raw power to be better equipped at taking out certain components, so you have to feel them out and equip your ship accordingly.There is almost nothing more gratifying than hosing down an enemy ship with flamethrowers and just watching them BUUUURRRNNN! Although, seeing an enemies futilile attempt at burning yours after youve chem-sprayed, is even more rewarding... The Hwacha in particuliar is pretty frikken awesome too ; ) The weapons are just flat-out fun to use. Which is great, because that's what the whole game revolves around - shooting down your enemy. Cooperation is crucial, however, not always necessary if you have a competent crew. Coordination is also key.If you can get together some friends, it can make for some incredibly fun battles, some of the best you can have online imo. I mean, who doesnt like being the crew of a well-oiled killing machine!? The game is very balanced, and the only thing that is OP is communication.Graphics arent too great, sometimes they're kinda lackluster. The audio is pretty well done, with just some minor gripes here and there. All-in-all, for $3 it's a fkn steal. I never pay full price, but this game is worth a lot more than a few dollars.If you havent tried it, DO IT! everyone at least likes it for a little while. If you havent played in a while, come back and see the new changes. Theyve added a lot! Now with steam workshop!!			",162,19,7,24,22,2,22

												This game is one like none other. It features dynamic aerial combat, stunning graphics, a tight nit, friendly community and entertaining gameplay all in one package. It is a game that draws players from every corner of the gaming community, and gives them the experience they have been looking for. Guns of Icarus Online is backed by a driven developer team who strive to see this game grow for the sake of entertaining the common gamer. It is easy to fall in love with this game, and hard to leave. To all those who brave the battle-laden skies of Guns Of Icarus, I wish to you fair winds, and clear skies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most fun team based games I've played.  With only 4 players per team communication is key.  It may seem, at first glance, to be strictly a shoot-em-up in a gunship, but there is a lot of in-depth strategy under the hood, especially in higher level matches.  One of my favorite things about this game (other than pulverizing enemies and scrambling around a dying ship trying to sqeeuze out another breath of life from her) is the community.  It's one of the best I've seen!			",44,8,0,7,9,0,18

												Guns of Icarus Online is set 300 hundred years after a long conflict for resources. During this conflict, humanity has squandered any resources that would have taken them forward and have fallen back on the steel from the past. Using this steel they craft airships to travel the land for resources and trade.Before joining the battles, you first need to choose your role. You can choose among being an engineer, gunner and pilot. Each role is able to equip 3 role specific items and 1 item for the other two roles. This allows you to be both proficient at your role and help out with the other roles, if need be.Each crew is made of 4 players and any of them can chose be the captain and bring their ship to the table. The ships can be customized with various weapons including mortars, flak cannons, gatling guns and even a flamethrower. Not only does it matter where you damage enemy ship but also what type of weapon you use to deal the damage.This is where the strategic elements come from. As the captain/pilot you need select the best weapons and ship to suite your play style. The gunner needs to know what type of ammo to use for each gun for maximum effect. The engineer needs to prioritize what parts of the ship to repair or build first to keep it running.It has a distinct steam-punk theme to it. The ships are made of steel girders with steel plating as armor and are kept afloat by giant balloons. As ships parts begin to take damage they start smoking and eventually stop working. When a ship is destroyed, it violently explodes and showers the ground with its various parts. The soundtrack has a good mix of simple melodies for the menus and thumping drum beats for the battles. The guns all sound very hard hitting, yet they all have very distinct sounds to them.Overall I was impressed by Guns of Icarus. Not only does it break the mold by not being a high octane shooter but it manages to blend action and simulation. It manages to be light enough to jump in for a couple rounds and deep enough to keep you playing for hours.			",90,4,0,12,10,0,24

												Guns of Icarus is a game I'd label as ""crewed vehicular combat"" with a steampunk theme. A crew of players on an airship with many other crews on other airships of both friend and foe. You fight with various manned guns placed on the ship; damaging the enemys' guns, engines, balloon, hull and armor while keeping your own repaired when you can.There's strategy, there's teamwork, there's action. Most of all it's a fresh idea! Don't get me wrong I have nothing against other shooters, but this game does something new;something new is incredibly more worthwhile then another game of something that's already been made when it's good.Sadly this game is on a list of games that's amazing and deserves a lot of attention from many but just doesn't get it. It manages about 300 players at peak times on a weekend right now. While the game is loaded with clans eager to include you to their fleet the game doesn't offer much for the casual player.The lobby in this game is more than a bit sluggish if I'm honest. Everyone can see everyone else's ship and weapon loadouts. So both sides constantly change their loadouts to be the counter to the opponent's loadout. So it's like watching people play ""Paper Rock Scissors"" but they're allowed to change their decisions and see what the opponent is using. ...for literally ten minutes I usually wait on the captains over this - usually only stopping because the room ran out of time. This is really the only thing I find glaring about this game; the lobby.There's been word for a while about this game getting a Coop and adventure mode. While it isn't out yet that does sound like something that'll get a heavy activity boost. I can't say much about that though other than I'm eager to see it.			",527,112,15,50,38,2,73

												I would love to recommend this game, because for what it is its a wonderful experience - however I have to address the single reason its not currently a good investment:The game is dying. As it stands right now (before Alliance is officially released) PvP is the only gamemode. And there are hardly any players left outside of peak gametimes. Even at peak gametimes, its not really that great - mainly 4 semifull lobbies.Its bad. And Muse does little to help address fundemental matchmaking problems. Guns of Icarus is a PvP game (right now), but in matchmaking lobbies all players can see the weapon layout of enemy ships. Which makes literally no sense, because it turns lobbies into drawn out countering matches and forces a handful of meta-ships to counter specific meta-ships. Lobbies are ""balanced"", but ship crews are often composed of full-clan ships with crews that have hundreds of games under their belts. The other ships are often newer players trying to dip their toes in the game. And wouldn't you guess who gets gunned out of the sky?Look I understand its how the game works. Its not really anyones fault, thats just how it is. But the simple facts are as follows:1. Many new players stick it out for a few games and then quit and play other things.2. The pool of existing players is shrinking, as vets leave for other games.3. The game is requires a substantial playerbase to continue to be enjoyable.I'll let you figure it out from there. I sincerely hope to see some of you in the skies.... but I'm not misleading anyone into wasting their money. I enjoyed the game, but when 90% of my so called gametime is me alt-tabbed out and waiting for matches to start I can't recommend this in good conscience.--- Edited below for those who are still interested ( As of November 11th, 2016 )  ---Its now only a short time before Alliance is released, and I've been asked by several people if I would be willing to give the game a follow up try.I did. And I would recommend the game even less now. The userbase that plays this game has decayed to a somewhat horrifying point - people play, but there are serious issues with the game that have become painfully highlighted due to lack of players. For one, all the same issues persist in PvP, which is still the games primary gamemode. All players can still currently see the layouts of enemy ships, which forces a horrible counter meta into the game and saps the ability for captains to comfortably diversify loadouts. Clan ships still dominate the lobbies, although this has been lessened by the fact that so many people have simply quit the game - logically leading to less clan players. Still, the norm is to see one or more highly veteran ship crews sitting in a lobby and chewing through all comers. Etc.The real issue is with the upcoming DLC, and the worry that once the DLC comes out, Co-op vs. AI matches will sap even more players from the already struggling PvP modes. Theres also the underlying issue that aside from the addition of a few maps and decals, not much has been added to the game in quite some time - and PvP is planned to remain the same.Don't get me wrong, flying an airship is fun... but not everyone gets to fly, do they? Those of us who typically crew the ship (gunners and engineers) are usually stationed on meta ships (because of the bloody see-all lobbies), in relatively familiar combat scenarios, for the majority of our games. Tedium (tedious) is the word I feel best describes PvP as it stands now.Guns of Icarus is more than worth the asking price for the game. No question, its a great value buy. Personally I've gotten more than enough hours out of the game to merit the money I put down for it.I just wouldn't recommend it. There are other games that I feel would have been better uses of my time.			",187,32,2,39,28,2,64

												'why is the enemy ship still alive''because everyone is repairing the hull'I love this game6th marchNow onto the serious bit of the review.Guns of icarus online is a team based fps/strategy game in which you will fill out a role out of a gunner which has the ability to carry more ammo types for guns and one repair and pilot item, an engineer who can bring three repair items and an ammo type and a pilot item, and then the pilot who can bring three pilot items and one repair and a ammo type (like a pilot will ever use a gun though) and then do battle with your loadout.Gameplay.Gameplay in guns of icarus is really dependant on your role, if your an engineer you will spend most of your time repairing damaged parts of the ship like the hull, guns and engines and fill out time between that manning the smaller guns of the ship, if your the gunner you will be most of the time using heavy weaponry to bring down a ship with special ammo types like lesmok for increased range or charged for heavy damage, where as the pilot of the ship will be responsable for the majority since he/she will be flying the ship and have to give the gunner good shots and minimise damage to help the engineer(s) manage repairs. on each ship there will be four crew members, more often then not the layout will be two engineers and a gunner with pilot but sometimes there will be differances. While there are three base classes the community has made subclasses like the gunineer which is a engineer that uses guns more then repairs or the metamidion which is a pyramidon that is designed to kill ships increadibly quickly with a chaingun and mortor combo. Character and ship customisationOnce you start the game up you wont have much in terms of customisation of your appeal but you can unlock most of it by playing classes and ranking them up to unlock pieces for free, while you can buy most of these with real life money from what i'v seen most items can be unlocked in time, in terms of ship though you have the same issue only from what i'v seen so far no ship customisation item can be unlocked for free. i want to also make this point clear, everything ingame that you unlock are purely cosmetic.the communityThe guns of icarus community is by far one of my favorites, will many great clans for both the competitive and casual gamer, I have fond memorys of a certain clan where i met so many awesome people, the GOIO community is by far one of the best communities i have ever seen in gaming.Game mode varityAs it stands theres only the standard team death match where your team has to get a certain amount of kills before, a king of the hill mode where you have to capture a point and hold it to get points killing ships also gets points for your team and a crazy king mode where the capture point is constantly moving. though i mainly play deathmatch i have never had a game that left me bored and wanting more. i always stopped playing this game satisfied.ConclusionGuns of icarus is a really great game, the community will always welcome new players and not berate you for making mistakes and finding a clan that suits your style of play even if your a competitive player or looking for a little bit of fun in your spare time. for now i'll leave with this closing remark, Munkers are so much fun			",151,11,0,18,8,2,20

												My first experience, in One session:I went through all the tutorial stuff first, And I found the concepts to be very simple.I decorated my character to how I pleased with what I had.After that, it was gametime. I had a friend introduce me into the ship types and gun types, as well as what each class would do at all times. We joined an online game, and was put with 2 other people- A gunner and a Pilot.The ship was a Squid. We had a flamer and gattling, and Frankly, that was all we needed.The pilot Blew at his job... So I jacked the wheel. The control was so easy to finesse, to turn and raise was elegant, timely, and gave me plenty of time and ability to work with my gunners' needs. my friend managed the engines, hull, and balloon like a beast, and the pilot was upset I upstaged him (By far.)After that, I found another pilot, my friend left after another game, and I was on my own with this Pilot, a badass gunner, and a random second engineer.We lost 2, won 5.And it was, without a doubt, the most fun and enjoyment I have ever had from an online, player to player combat experience.I would recommend, No, I would Require, everyone I know, to at least learn of this game at one point in their lifetime.

												I have to admitt I'm always very skeptic about multiplayer games that rely on cooperation that much. This game has proven that teamwork is not about shouting at other people while doing all the work together. Teamwork is a pure pleasure of seeing how communication, trust and loyality work together, giving visble results in a form of spectacular explosions on the enemy's airship. The key factor and the biggest plus of that game is it's community. Even if I was doing something completely wrong, or when I accidentally rammmed the ship of our allies, I was surprised by the way people react. Usually I meet with friendly advices from better players, or laugh from my fellow newbies. Basically, the only situation when I saw (or rather heard) someone flaming someone was when the crewmate did whatever he wanted, didn't response to any communications or direct orders. If you want to play as one-man-army, this game is really not for you. Does the game have any minuses? Of course it does. Small number of players is the biggest one. Small number means inequality, and sometimes you might find yourelf facing a ship of well played elite, from which you can't do much. Actually, that's not really true, becouse you can always train more, become better, and knock them off with your superiority, but you get the point. Some people also listed out small number of airships and weapons. I'm not playing that game for long, so I can't tell, but what I saw so far, is enough to provide a lot of diversity and every play is sortof different. Plus, Devs are working on the new update with planes and more ammo, so I think we're gonna have to put that point away soon.Overall, the game is really fun, and with good team you can work miracles. With friendly community that provides good teammates even if noone of your steam-friends play this game, I highly recommend Guns of Icarus Online. Feel free to invite Clockeye to your crew.Fly High friends!			",22,7,0,4,0,0,0

												This is the best co-op experience I have ever had.  In this game, you are on a steampunk airship with three other people and you have to work together to stay alive as well as take down other airships that want to permanently ground you.  This game rewards coordination and cooperation not just with the crew of the ship you are on but also, if you are the captain of the ship, with the other ships on your team.Outside of the game or while you’re waiting for a lobby to fill up, you will have plenty of things to do while you wait like check your achievement progress, build and customize the ship you will bring if you are in the position of ship captain, and customize your character with a steadily growing list of things that you unlock.On the ship you can be one of three classes that each have a job on the ship.  You can have at least one piece of equipment from each class and technically you can do any of the other jobs if the situation calls for it but everyone brings three pieces of equipment from their own class that makes them better at that job.The engineer makes sure your ship stays in one piece an in the air.  You primarily repair damaged or destroyed parts and put out fires using a variety of tools at your disposal.  You also have the ability to sprint for a short time to quickly get to that pesky hull that just went down again.The gunner brings the pain to enemy ships.  They can bring three types of ammunition that each have their own ups and downs that benefit different types of guns.  You also can quickly reload a weapon you’re on. The pilot, which is normally the captain, navigates the ship through the map, lines up the gunner’s shots, and moves to try to give your engineers enough time to repair the damage you have inevitably taken.  They can bring special charms and tools to perform special maneuvers such as quick turns or smoke clouds even though most of them tend to damage the ship in some way they can really give your ship the extra edge.There are a few things you should know about this game though.First off it has a very steep learning curve.  The tutorial gives you the basic controls but there are so many tools, guns, and ships that figuring everything out is a real challenge for new players so asking for help and directions early on is a good thing to do.Second you are probably going to want a microphone.  While you can play without it, not having it severely handicaps you and your ability to coordinate with other captains and crew.Finally, as of this review, the number of people playing this game is really small.  It’s such a problem that I would suggest using this site ( http://steamcharts.com/app/209080 ) so you can play it when there are a fair number of people playing. (about 150 finds me a game and it’s easier if you play with friends).Overall, if you are looking for a real original and great co-op experience to play with friends or with others in a small community then this is definitely something to pick up.

												I'd love to love this game. And I've really tried -- for over 1000 hours. But I just can't anymore. An *extremely* under-experienced (yet incredibly friendly!) development team leads to a very unpolished game, with an ongoing and haphazardly drastic development process. Due to constant 'rebalancing' patches, it's very different than when I purchased it, and not in a good way.The game itself revolves around three asymmetric roles. They are generally played fairly straight forward, and are each arguably shallow. Pilots (should) stand at the wheel ~99% of the time, just flying the ship and mostly disconnected from the on-deck action. Engineers and gunners will spend most of their time firing a single weapon (possibly two) or repeatedly clicking on ship components using a limited variety of tools.Teamwork and communication are the real name of the game, so if you don't plan on being an active participant of in-game voice chat, I'd entirely skip this game. Dealing with uncooperative or non-responsive teammates can be very frustrating, and is a serious problem in battle. Obviously, this lends a large advantage to pre-made teams, as coordination between members is more important than any one role.This leads to a few 'interesting' problems. New players will stand nearly no chance against experienced teams. This can be quite unpleasant for new players, and is unfortunately very common. However, the experienced teams themselves have an equally hard time finding a balanced match. There is no matchmaking system for teams [nor do I believe there will ever be a way to properly quantify teamwork/communication over role performance]. This leads to LONG WAIT TIMES between matches (~1/2 of my logged hours were spent in lobby), very unbalanced matches, and general frustration from both new players and experienced crews.On a technical level, it plays no better than a solid beta; Graphics are fairly poor, yet somehow not fully optimized, and net code leaves a lot to be desired. Poor graphical performance and frequent lag spikes are par for the course. I have an average PC with good broadband, and still sporadically get crap for both FPS and ping, with potentially serious impact on game play. Syncing errors leaving you unable to interact with the ship, and bugs with ""Steam's"" voice servers that make you unable to verbally communicate are far too common. This game has been out for over a year and dealing very basic things like these are still on the 'To-Do' list.Development cycle is also more like a beta than a final product.  Constant and irregularly released  patches address the endless sea of old and newly created bugs. They often include ***extreme*** ""re-balancing"" of ANY aspect of the game (from lobby structure to a complete overhaul of physics, and every stat inbetween), or sometimes add new content. The game is not and has not ever been stable, either in code or in game balance in the first place. Any changes or additions to the game often make these preexisting problems worse. Unfortunately, more often than not, the added content is entirely useless or strategically ignorable.There are those who will sing the chorus ""The community is great! The development team is so involved!"" I will concede that this is the friendliest development team I've ever seen. That does not mean that they are the most professional. As a result, the game has some wonderful qualities and ideas that are put into execution rather poorly. A large part of the reason why the community is 'great' is entirely artificial, due to strict behavioral guidelines. Trolling, profanity, harassment will all get you heavily censored or kicked/banned from the game. This is not at all an idle threat, and moderators are often extremely biased towards veteran players.But... If you've read all this, you've probably already made up your mind. And thats fine! If you THINK you'll like it, you'll probably enjoy it for a good while despite its very obvious and glaring flaws, even though I no longer can. If you do enjoy it, remember the game can change entirely at any moment with a new 'balance' patch. Have fun while it lasts, and tell the ducks dragonmere says quack off! ;-)			",491,128,20,58,41,5,64

												While I do recommend the game, it is not as active as it once was two years ago. Server population hovers below the 100 mark, and you will be lucky to get a full lobby. New players get decimated due to the fact the only people they meet are veterans who have been playing for years. Highly enjoyable when playing with friends. Guns of Icarus has friendly devs and a great community of about 8 people.9/10 wish people actually played this game.			",39,6,0,8,6,0,5

Steampunk battles, fleet against fleet,Every single airship armed to the teeth.You will hear them behind the clouds, coming from afar,If you fear those sounds, better wish upon a falling star.Their cannons shall burst, and make a loud roar,But you haven't seen the worst, you'd be wise to hit the floor.In this case the floor is the deck,But soon it will also be part of the shipwreck.If you are a captain, you'll hope your crew is ready,If you are a gunner, you'll hope your aim is steady.For from a warship, flying so high,You cannot escape, you can only fight or die.The time of running and cowering is no more,In these skies it is a time of war.And that falling star will not help you, if you wished upon it before,Because it wasn't a star, it was the enemy's double-barreled mortar.

												This is a truly amazing game that lacks the attention it deserves!A game where real synergy - through communication, cooperation, delagation and leadership - are the only means for victory, on the ship and on the overall battlefield.The game brings brilliant graphics in the successful designs of each ship and map. An assortment of ships and guns that suit any crew's style. And a quick and smooth fluidity that will make one forgot that it's all just a computer game.It is definately a title that must jump into VR!I recommend everybody to try this game at least once. That will be enough to show the reality of joining a crew.There is no 'I' in the word 'team'. And this game will demonstrate just that.So choose your role in the crew and help your shipmates rule the skies!			",19,2,0,2,1,0,0

												Can I just say, this game is fantastic.  The players have a great sense of humor and, for the most part, are great to be around.  And, when they aren't trying to convince rookies that all crew members should switch over to gunners, they are very helpful.  One of my favorite things about this game is the fact everyone is on a level playing field.  My crew and I have butchered higher level players and yes, we've all been creamed by lower level rookies, but that is what makes this game fun.  The art is lovely, the community is a blast, and the game play is a ton of fun.  Conclusion:  Everyone ought to check this game out.			",14,1,0,0,1,0,1

												Guns of Icarus. It could have been a great game, it was once upon a time. Don't get me wrong, Guns of Icarus is an absolute treat for anyone who loves steampunk and airships, and it portrays those themes well. So, there's that.The majority of the development team behind Guns of Icarus are some of the nicest people I have talked to. Despite the flaws in and around Guns of Icarus, they remain top notch humans.Guns of Icarus is a prime example of a game with a ton of potentional, and a unique, thriving community that was squandered by the development team- MUSE. Unfortunately MUSE was not able to understand the magic that made this game so great for a long time. Therefore, Guns of Icarus was never cultivated, or given room to grow, into something greater than its origin. A PvP game needs a few things to grow, or simply to survive. The most important factor in a PvP game is a healthy community. Without players, there is no PvP, and thus no game. It needs exciting, new content on a regular basis to keep that community interested and coming back for more. It needs a healthy, and popular competitive scene. And it needs constant, observant and thoughtful balance maintenance. These factors are like the sides of a pyramid, and a PvP game needs all three working to survive. Guns of Icarus has paid attention to one, sometimes two of these sides, but never at the same time and never consistently enough to matter.It is a curiosity to me that the same team company could make a game as brilliant as Guns of Icarus was (at its release), and then contribute so much greatly to its fall, so far from it's lofty perch. Unfortunately this amateur team of developers never learned from their mistakes, never listened to feedback, and we have all paid the price for it. Guns of Icarus is laying in the shadow of its former glory and potentional.			",130,26,0,22,15,2,27

 GOOD POINTS   Awesome theme if you're into Steampunk  Awesome gameplay if you're into games that requires teamwork to win  Awesome gameplay if you're that type of guy who is not good in playing games but can follow instructions very well  Graphics are good. For an indie game, it has stunning graphics.  Cosmetic Skins  Despite my high ping and slow internet connection, it doesn't affect my gameplay. My shots don't miss, my repair time isn't slowed down, the control of the ship doesn't get messed up  Has different gamemodes aside from blowing ships up    BAD POINTS   Small community. Whenever I play, there are only 200-300 people online. Please buy this game ffs, it's a great game everything you could ask for can be found within this game.

												Teamwork oriented game. Recommend to start with friends to get used to the basic game mechanics with players with the same skill level (also playing with experienced captains helps to learn some smart tricks). Having mic helps a lot to get started. Friendly community is always open to help new communicative players.At least four captains needed to get a 2vs2 game started (AI only replaces crew members). Matchmaking (MM) tries to balance the lobbies but due to small player base it doesn't work every time. The new MM support makes sure games are started in a reasonable time manner compared to the old lobby system.Teamwork can outweight lack of skill and all ships/weapons/tools are available to everyone. In game store only relevant for cosmetic items like goggles, costumes etc. There are two days in the week where you can play with the developers and unlock any item from the store if you win (just find a good captain).Regular game updates to balance ships and weapons.EDIT 14/12/05: Matchmaking support.

												This game is absolutely fantastic, the game is filled with great fights between two teams of engineers captains and gunners and normally has a non-standard community that is accepting of new players and helps them learn the ropes fast, not to mention the sportsmanship for both the losing and winning teams.Its very competitive and there are the higher ranking teams that are groups of friends rather than random matches, although with that, as long as everyone knows their part they can help the team win.Also has a pretty nifty customization of characters to show off anything that you've earned, from birthday hats, to holiday hats, to misc apparel you get for unlocking achievements, these are able to be dyed.Story: X/10Gameplay: 10/10Presentation: 10/10Soundtrack: 8/10 (Loud does not mean epic. but it does sound good. not great)Replayability: 9/10 (You may rage quit.)

												TL;DR is at the bottom.        This game is fun...If you play it right. There's no casual gamemode you can play to just goof around and be stupid, as fun as that may be. It's difficult, requires good communication and skilled players; theres nothing more frustrating than having an idiot on the ship. Now, even though all the roles are important, you absolutely need a dedicated pilot. I tried playing this game as a gunner (because who doesn't want to shoot rocket launchers and gattling guns at airships) but I had to stop because  of all the times I was paired with a random pilot who had no idea what they were doing and no mic. It honestly just ruins the game when your pilot is incompetent. So I decided to play as a pilot. I got my brother and two friends to be engineers and gunners and I have never had as much fun playing a game.       We we're new to the game but we're able to take on level 30+ players because we had a good crew. We still would lose to the veteran players often, but it usually was a long intense battle that was extremely fun whether or not we won. Another bonus to having a pre-formed crew is that the wait time is decreased astronomically. When we join a game we immediately fill up one ship which cuts the wait time by a lot. Even when I dont have people I know get on with me I still enjoy solo-queing (I dont recommend doing this unless you're a pilot) because competent gunners and engineers are easier to come across and ai can do alright if you're missing a player.      Another thing that I often hear people complain about is the steep learning curve and ""seal-clubbing"" veteran players. Both of these are true. Now, after saying that I still highly recommend you get past the difficult learning curve, a crew and choosing one ship and then sticking with it will really help you get through the early game heartbreak. As for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players, theres nothing that can really be done about them. Mute them early on in the game, do everything you can to outplay them, and dont get demoralized if you lose 10 or more games in a row. At the time of writing this review I only have 15 hours on this game, and I believe that me and my crew are past the learning curve; we dont get trash talked by other players, we are nice and inviting to new players, and we always enjoy the game even if we lose. So buy this game! I think it's worth the price but it does go on sale (I got it for $3).     TL;DRGet this game on saleGet friends to play withHave a dedicated pilotHave a dedicated shipHave a frickin micDeal with the long que timespush through the difficultiesBe nice to new playersI personally love this game and hope that it can develop a larger community. If you get the game you can friend me (Sir. Bretzel) and I'll try to play some matches with you to get you past the learning curve. Also, if you play CS;GO then this community will seem very nice in comparison.			",50,7,0,5,3,0,1

												Where to start? Well this game is stunning!! Probably one of the most unique ideas I have ever played in a video game Guns of Icarus Online throws you into another world unlike our own. You are stuck on an airship with a group of strangers and your sole duty is to keep the flying fortress flying as you soar through crimson skys. On board all 4 players have a role they must repair the ship, man the arsonal of guns, and steer the ship from objects and your enemies. All of these roles need to be performed in unison or the entire ship will go down. An almost fairy tale universe that is best brought to life by you and your friends.			",80,3,1,4,3,0,4

												Before buying this game, I suggest you find a word ""cooperative"" in your dictionary.This is;the best game for truly cooperative players,a cramped game for players who misunderstand coop as just multi and play for getting achievements,a game to be tried to see your latent power (or to feel stress sometimes) for players who want to play seriously but have such achievement junk on the same ship.Understanding basics generates innovative, advanced tactics.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Coopが何たるか理解している人にとっては最高のゲーム、CoopをただのMultiと勘違いして実績獲得に走る人にとっては窮屈なゲーム、Coopしたいのに意に沿わない実績厨と組んでしまった人にとっては底力を試される（あるいはストレスを感じるだけの）ゲーム。			",70,18,1,5,14,1,6

												It's hard to describe how much of a good game this is, so let me give it a shot here...Guns of Icarus is unique - there's simply nothing like it. It's a genuine idea that's been executed very well thus far. I'll continue:The absolute best gaming community I have ever seen, the most amazing implementation of teamwork, and the stunning originality of games is all right here, Guns of Icarus online. The gaming world nowadays lacks ingenuity, and really needs well thought out games that are very different than the others, I find that Guns of Icarus did this spot on. I admit, at first I had my  scepticisms. I didn’t see how a steampunk game where you fly blimps and fight each other in the skies would work, it seemed bizarre to me. Then I actually played the game, it’s finally a great idea that was executed well. Caring developers, kind community members, perhaps the most welcoming game in the world to beginners and new players, and the level of teamwork that they planned to implement into this astounds me. I can’t really explain how much of an enjoyable experience this is, all I can say is, this is a must buy and you have to play it yourself to understand what I am talking about.I haven't played this game as long as most, but I assure you my hours will only be going up. With the coming addition of Alliance, I trust this game will be as good as ever.See you in the skies, fellow aviator!			",95,50,0,21,11,2,28

												This has to be one of the most original games I've played in a while. Communication is really important on this and this game excels even Left 4 Dead in it's teamwork. There are tons of ships to command with tons of guns that each steer and fire completely differently depending on what you choose. Do NOT get this game if you don't have a mic, since (especially if you're steering) you need to be talking to the crew constantly.If you enjoy something new and completely original, get this game. And send me an invite.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My whole life as a gamer I have not met a more friendly community than the one that follows Guns of Icarus Online. The players are mostly very mature and the ability to talk with them with microphone during the game brings the game to a new level. Admins and developers are also very friendly and regulary play with the players, talking to them and responding to every question they have.The game itself has a very nice steampunky feel and despite it having ""only"" 3 classes, there is no shortage of fun. There is a role for everyone, and the 3 available classes will keep you occupied for a long time.Each ship can be customized, every class can choose from a variety of tools to take into the game and once there, there is really no shortage of tactics involved. Will you be able to outsmart your opponents and be a superior crew because of your internal organisation?As far as the visuals go, game is made to be really pretty. Despite it having good and somewhat demanding graphics it is mostly totaly lag free and runs incredibly smooth. if your computer is a bit on the slow side, you can always try lowering the quality and removing some of the filters. The game very quickly made it into my favorite list and it is currently my most played game.Recommendation!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9.8/10!A very awesome game and experience for those who like REAL cooperative gameplay!Tactics and Strategy are very welcome, but a fun game to play even alone by joining with random people. It has been pretty easy for me to join matches with great people with nice coordination and communication skills. The community is friendly and, sometimes, a bit insane (make a weird noise on your mic and eventually something much more weird will happen). Fortunately  I never had nor witnessed any problems or even stress between players (which are frequent on games that use voice as primary communication, and random teams).You can make clans and/or parties to be able to join up matches with your friends. For more information, watch the videos. But this game is EXTREMELY fun and is a must-have for anyone who likes co-op and explosions.The 4-pack is a great choice since each ship takes a crew of 4 people - bring your friends on!The only issues I ran into was the ocassional lag spike and some UI bugs on new features, but it doesn't break anything and don't even get in the way of the fun. I also believe more features can and should be implemented to build up on the awesomeness of the current experience. The devs probably have plans for that.Note 1: This is NOT a generic FPS. There's no land/boarding combat between ship crews. IMO, this makes the game even better. [EDIT: There's no boarding in the dev plans, the devs believe this would hurt teamwork - and so do I].Note 2: This game requires cooperation and communication. If you don't have a mic or don't like talking much, use the in-game signals [press V] to alert enemy positions, to ask your pilot to raise/lower altitude or change direction, or even to ask for repairs. There's a HUGE difference between a well balanced and communicative crew, to a silence-while-everyone-do-their-own-thing crew. You'll be surprised with the amount of cool, nice people who are all interested in having a fun match - even on novice servers. Last but not least, if you see a member from the Vagabonds [VGB] clan, make sure to say hi and join us for awesome matches! :)EDIT: Beware of the review dates about this game. It seems that the initial bugfixing after the release of this game was pretty chaotic, while the devs where trying to balance features and fix issues.Currently, however, this is very much a completely different game from the one described by 2013 (and older) reviews. The current issues are all being fixed by the developers - including external issues that are being caused by the server hosting company.			",149,23,1,25,35,1,25

Really unique/deep combat system which rewards the players for working together as a team. Need friends to group up and play to truly enjoy the game but when you it's an incredible time. Guns of Icarus is certainly worth picking up and giving a serious shot.			",531,126,12,64,51,5,69

												Strangely addicting game that takes alot of teamwork to have your ship run smoothly. I was a bit confused by all of the different voice and text chats when I first started playing but they are very helpful once you figure them out. There is a text chat for your ship crew, your team, and then the full lobby. You also have voice chat for the entire lobby or your crew. The community is generally nice. Id suggest adding people you enjoyed playing with as a friend pretty quickly so you can join games with people you know are reliable. Pretty easy to pick up the mechanics, and most people will try to help explain the game to you.People have joked that Guns should be called ""Game of Lobbies"". Yes the matchmaking can take a while, but the amount of active players seems to hover around 250 to 350.			",64,4,1,6,5,0,4

												This game is one of the single most enjoyable gaming experiences out there for me right now. It fills a niche that I didn't even know existed, and provides a wonderfully unique gameplay experience that has cost me 300 hours of my life so far (which I don't want back!). Communication is paramount in this game, and if you just get the basics of it down, you'll find that you open up to a varied meta of playstyles that are born of different teams mixing their unique strengths and weaknesses together. In other words, no two matches are the same.Additionally, this game has some of the most organic ""wow"" moments I have seen in gaming so far. Rather than the fast, montage-bait killstreaks you'll find on many competitive online games, here you'll find the ""wow"" moments coming from last minute decisions which keep you alive while rockets, bullets and fire engulf your ship from all angles and those other times where a drawn out battle leads you to finally down that enemy ship that has harassed your team the entire match. There's so much satisfaction to be had, knowing that your kill was earned through being the finer oiled machine than the people who bit the dust due to you.All in all, a wonderful experience that I wholeheartedly recommend.That doesn't mean all gems come out of the earth without a litle bit of sediment still attached. That is to say, there are some issues with the game that you should take into account pre-purchase:Firstly, and in my opinion the biggest problem with the game, is the player population is very low at present. While we have spikes during sales and youtuber promotions, it usually settles back down again. This can lead to very unfair matchmaking that can wind you and your fresh-off-the-back-of-a-purchase friends taking on some of the longest standing players in the game. This difference in experience and game knowledge can lead to some absolutely crushing defeats. To combat this, I'd recommend being polite and perusing/posting on the community forums in order to find more experienced players to party up with. Not only are many in the community happy to teach newer players with a patient demeanour, but you'll find much more fun when ever second match isn't furiously stacked in the enemy teams favour.Secondly, absolutely, positively, definitely, DO NOT SKIP THE TUTORIALS. This game isn't as simple as ""shoot thing, thing die"" nor is it as simple as ""hit thing, thing fixed"". The tutorials will provide you with the very basics to be competent in your first few matches without going too far into the higher-level play (most of which you'll pick up through experimentation and advice from veterans). I'd also recommend, again, hitting the forums and reading up player guides. Just a little bit of background reading will make the game mechanics make so much more sense. Finally, you may not have a microphone or the confidence to communicate verbally, which is fine, but at least be able to listen if not speak. This game requires more communication than anything else I have played so far, and updates on enemy positions and current priorities make the difference up between life and death.TL;DR+Game good.+Strategy is complex and satisfying.+Unique, nothign else like it.-Low player population.-Tutorials mainly text based, game won't spoonfeed you (get your reading glasses on).9/10, would airship again.

												How to Have Fun In This GameIt's not about winning. It's about your team. If you want to be a captain, but you're afraid you won't be any good, talk to your team. Let them know you're anxious or new. The community in this game never ceases to amaze me; just be serious about it, and others will respond. I'm not the greatest captain ever, yet somehow I managed to retain three Russian speaking teammates despite the inability to speak to each other, except for them to be able to say ""You are terrible captain"", to which we all laughed hysterically. The only English they knew and it was enough to tell me I sucked.Have fun. That's what it is. There will be matches you just always win; there will be matches you lose historically. You may level up, you may not; some people grind for levels, some people- like me- forget achievements exist and stay level 7 for two years. Also, this is a FANTASTIC game to livestream. Almost ALL of my best livestreams are because of this game. When you can announce to a match that you're livestreaming and the worst thing that happens is one guy squealing ""I'M FAMOUS"" and everyone else screaming in high pitched voices, you know it's a good community. And community is EVERYTHING with games like these.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DISCLAIMER: When I wrote this review, I was a player and a player only. Over six months after I wrote this, I started working for Muse as an intern. I leave this up here as it's still a reflection of my opinion of the game. I am NOT being paid to say that - like I'd be so lucky :P.This game is such a fantastic breath of fresh air. It is fast-paced, quirky and a joy to play. The community is full of exemplary individuals who are out to have a good time and wring out all that this game has to offer. The teamwork-based gameplay is a great system and makes that tricky win against worthy foes all the more rewarding when you know you pulled it off because the whole team worked hard and as a well-oiled unit.Undoubtedly a dear game to my heart - this game will not sit idle in your Library.

												First of all I would like to say this game is definitely worth it for its current sale price (£2.75) and is honestly some of the most multiplayer fun I've had with my friends. Overall the game is really original and there's nothing quite like it, all the airships control differently, the levelling system is really fair and interesting in how you level up on each class (engineer, pilot and gunner), the guns just feel awesome and the sweet feeling you get when you destroy an enemy ship is like none other.However, there is one major issue. The customization system look's like it came straight out of a F2P game, the fact that this game's original price is £11 and that they charge up to £2 for different clothes and stuff for your ship is just wrong. Luckily none of the 'extra' stuff actually affects how decent your ship or crew are, it's just very irritating as there is no in-game credit system.That's really the main problem, even though the overall feeling of the game when actually playing it is great, you can't help but feel like you've been cheated if you've paid the full price of the game. But, for £2.75 you really can't go wrong, the differnt ships and weapons are just endless fun with friends, and the community are really awesome! if they sort out the whole economy system of the game then it would be a definite recommendation for its current sale price.

												I purchased this game a megaton of time ago. Mostly two or so years back. However, back then my computer broke, had to reinstall everything, and I forgot about it. A few days ago I decided to reinstall it and get back to it, see how it stands out today. As usual, I will start with the negative parts of the game; thankfully, there's just two big complains:First and foremost, the community. Back then you could get matches instantly. That ain't happening anymore, as while you could find over 3000 players online, right now it barely reaches 300 at some peek hours, while usually sticking to 50 players online at others. That translates into long search times, and when you do find a game, it will most likely be from a far away country, giving you quite the amount of lag. An easy fix to this would be, for example, a free weekend with a big sale going along, although that might happen when the ""coop"" mode is actually made. However, that was being announced way before my computer broke and there's still no sign of that, so I wouldn't get my hopes up.The second problem there is, is the tutorials. They need some work. There's 4 little tutorials to help you understand basic controls and using the three different classes, however these tutorials are just singleplayer stages with a TON of white text appearing on your screen and fading away.   The worst part about it is when the text banishes before you could even finish reading it, and another block of information appears ahead of you. There's also the fact that new players don't need to unlock anything to play properly, which is nice, however levels rise up way too slow because they use achievements to track down your experience. It's a neat idea, but as with the tutorials it needs some work to improve, as a lot of the achievements are things like ""Play/Win X amount of games"", and with the current community THAT'S A REAL F#CKING GRINDFEST.However, leaving those problems aside, what's left is a really fun experience.What community is left, you can bet is nice. I haven't yet found A SINGLE #sshole, a SINGLE rude player who would blame it all on someone else. It's all about teamwork, it's a heavy team-based game and everyone has to do their part to stay alive. That translates into people treating eachother nice, and trying to keep the morale up.The gameplay itself is also a ton of fun: your captain picks up a ship and a loadout, and while his main job is to drive it properly and not crash into a mountain, the other 3 players (usually a gunner and two engineers) have to use the turret guns and keep all vital areas of the ship healthy enough. It's simple but with a ton of depth, and will get you hooked for more.The graphics and settings are also okay, going for a steam-punk style with tons of gears here and there, while the ships look amazing and the landscapes are quite big. I've only gotten frame-drops while inside sand-clouds, so that's a plus.The sound gets the job done. There's different voices you can pick for your character, you can speak to the microphone freely (gunners and engineers can speak to the rest of the crew of that ship, while Captains can also communicate with other captains of the team to coordinate), and there's also music... Although the music might get repetitive. It does seem to change arround how the battle goes, but you'll hear everything quite quick.Is the game worth it? I'd say, wait for a sale. Not because the price is high, but because there will be way more players when that happens.TL;DR Edition: Fun team-based game about being sky-pirates. However, barely has players left. Wait for a sale, as new players will go in.			",167,20,8,24,14,4,23

												An amazing game that nobody plays, which hurts it because it's a team multiplayer game.  Guns of Icarus allows players to live out their steampunk fantasies as the crew of a combat dirigible, patrolling the skies in search of enemy airships like them.  The captain flies the ship, the gunners operate the turrets, and the engineers repair damage caused by enemy gunners.  However, there are not enough crew members to manage all parts of the ship, so players must constantly run here and there focusing only on what's essential at the moment.  This role-based crew-of-a-ship aspect really creates and emphasizes a great feeling of teamwork rarely found in multiplayer games, and each player's role makes them feel unique and essential to the team, rather than just another identical soldier in the army.The game offers many different  airships to choose from, each one with a different physical layout that changes how it must be repaired and how its guns can be aimed.  The visuals of the game are beautiful and appropriately full of rust and brass, and the music is a blend of classical orchestra melodies and wartime drum cadences fitting of the setting.  Online matchmaking is a complete loss, though:  due to low playerbase queue times are sporadic and balancing skill levels on the team is nigh impossible.The sum of the parts adds up to an amazing positive in Guns of Icarus all the same, so if you can bear struggling through long wait times to find a game, games half-full of AI crewmembers, or have enough friends to play together, the satisfaction of playing a a TRUE team game more than makes up for it.

												This game is so good it inspired me to recreate the premise of it in real life. I was quite surprised when I woke up from a  month-long coma to find that I was still alive, having only suffered two broken arms, several broken ribs, a dislocated hip joint and a broken leg as well as third degrees burns that will stay with me for life despite the skin graft. Whilst setting fire to each other's hot-air balloons with aerosol-based flame throwers seemed like a good idea at the time...I think I'll just stick to Guns of Icarus...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really fun game. I love being a pilot and crashing onto other ships.I love being an engineer and fixing ships.I love being a gunman and shooting other ships down. ONE PROBLEM!THE GAME IS DEAD.They just really just advertise this game more. Maybe take the route TF2 took and make it F2P but if you bought it, you get some bonuses. It's really, really fun but it just needs something new! More classes? I don't know. JUST ADD SOMETHING THAT WON'T♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF THE COMMUNITY.			",45,4,2,6,7,0,1

												Of all the games I played, this one I come back to over and over. It become a game that I've made many friends and enjoyment. The interactions with Muse Games, the game developer, is just top spot and they allow players to futher help the community.All this have inspired some of the best communties I've ever had in a game. Allowing players to care for their fellow players and crewmates. I look forward to enjoying the future DLC that's coming out and having played some early game access, it's shaping up to be a very fun DLC, similar and yet so different from the orginal that it does not feel like a re-hash of the same theme.There are some downsides, balances can take a long time to be adjusted allowing meta to become stale, UI does not always flow smoothly from one to the next and seeing new updates is far apart. I this mostly a fault of having a small crew but that crew do care so much what is happening in the game. As a side effect of this, the player counts can change widely from a low 200 player to as many 3000 players, depending on it's cycle.At the end of the day, I recommend this game to all my friends, And will contiune to do so and always coming back to see more.

												I've never played a game quite like this one; as much as I'd like to write ""World War I-era co-op airship combat"" and let it sell itself, that wouldn't do it justice. It's a blast getting onto a zeppelin- with you and your friends collectively manning the guns, engines, and helm- and blowing enemy craft out of the sky. The visuals are outright gorgeous (and there's nothing quite like seeing an enemy zeppelin burst apart and have its frame crumble away in midair), and in spite of being confined to a single ship for any given round the gameplay is incredibly immersive- not to mention intense, and with a wide variety of weapons and strategies available to the player. Furthermore, the developers have taken an active role in communicating with their playerbase and have done well in keeping the game moving. There's to be an expansion of the game into co-op and conquest/economy territory, but the game is more than worth your time and money as-is. In fact, it's been enough to have me volunteer my time and sanity to help moderate it's (fantastic) community.Get this game.			",71,9,0,5,6,0,7

												I made a review almost a year ago when I first got it, and it was positive then, but I wanted to more accurately reflect upon the game in its current state. It's come a long way since then; levelling isn't as painful, they switched over to a matchmaking system (which isn't perfect, but it's not horrible), and Muse introduced a few other fixes that improved the game as a whole. Performance even feels a bit better, too.The game itself is wholly fun to play and is a unique experience. The game has a variety of different ships that can be customized with different weapons; this allows for players to experiment with different strategies for different maps and gameplay styles. There are currently three different gameplay modes, each with its own maps, which changes how gameplay is approached by the player. There are a few bugs here and there that need to be ironed out (ex. getting stuck on the corner of one of the staircases on the Squid), but there are not any bugs that make gameplay difficult or near impossible. Overall, matches feel fun and not only require technical ability but the ability to strategize effectively as well. There's a steep learning curve at first, but there always seem to be players who are willing to assist in this. (This is made easier thanks to the Community Ambassadors appointed by Muse.)I took a break from the game for a while to focus on college and whatnot, but when I came back to it about a month ago, I decided to look into joining a clan since I didn't have friends who played the game frequently. (Luckily, the game has sales frequently, so more of my friends have been joining in on the fun.) Honestly, it's one of the best things I did since getting this game, and it's something I wish I had done back when I first got the game. There are lots of different communities for people to join, so you're bound to meet people and clans interested in your gamestyle or interests. It really helped me connect with the community more as well as meet so many interesting people who I'm glad to call my friends. Joining a clan is not required to fully enjoy the experience of playing Guns of Icarus, but it certainly adds something special to it.There's a lot more I can say about this game, but long story short, GOIO isn't perfect, but it's definitely an enjoyable experience with much replayability. I'd definitely recommend buying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus. First you need a mic. It's not mandatory but it'll help tremendously.Second you need some friends to buy it. That's harder to accomplish. And also, it's better if they speak the same language.Third you get into the game and play the tutorial.Fourth you decide if you are the pilot, the gunner or an engineer.The pilot is, obviously, the helm. Sometimes, depending on the ship, you'll have to repair or man a gun nearby but most of the times, you'll just be piloting.The gunner is in charge of shooting stuff. That's not as easy as it may sound because you need to carefully select the types of ammunition you bring with you, depending on the gun layout of the ship. Discuss it with the captain. Remember that the best defense is to attack. You might be tempted to go repair stuff when things are going south but try to continue firing and disabling the enemy guns instead, it'll be more helpful if you can do it. Finally the engineer. You're always running everywhere to repair, buff, put out fires or man a turret when things are going nicely. It's quite a hard job because you need to keep in mind the cooldowns of your tools and prioritize the right things to repair first. And when you're on the guns, you need to time your shoots with the gunner to have a full clip ready to finish the enemy in one go as soon as its armor goes down. The atmosphere is steampunky and the ships are all very differet with their own strengths and weaknesses. Contrary to what the game tells you, the goldfish isn't actually the easiest to play because its gun coverage is actually quite bad. The Pyramidion is the one I recommed for beginners for his great frontal resilience and his double frontal light guns. Put a gatling and a mortar (it's quite a nice gun if you can aim it) and you're good to make your first steps.Cooperation is the key. Though sometimes the AI does a better job...

												Guns of Icarus is an really fun game!(Pros)You get to pilot your own airship and experience what its like to be a captian, or you could fire the huge guns as a gunner or be a star engineer and keep your ship afloat.The game itself is really fun and the community is super friendly and will give you hands with things you dont know like turning or shooting, or in what order you use the toolsIve hardly never got mad at losing in this game as its such a fun experience up to the point where you can win or lose, You can also name your ships and fully customse there looks just like your character outfit(Cons)The only problem i have with this game is the time it takes to start a match as its 3-4mins to start a new match which gets a tad annoying but not to the point where i dont enjoy the game.(Verdict)Im giving this game a 9/10 just cause its got alot going for it but its not perfect yet and its slowly getting there			",115,13,4,11,8,2,9

												This game is fast-paced first-person Steampunk game, tha I presonally find as one of the best Steampunk games on Steam. This game is extremely fun with your own friends as your crew members, but it can even be fun by playing by yourself. I will now list some Pros/Cons of this game.Pros- Helps with Team-building and making stronger bonds- Loads of Customization- New DLC coming soon- Very intense and competitive multiplayer battles- Kind and understanding community- VERY FEW TOXIC PLAYERS- Clan system- Different Roles (Engineer, Pilot, Gunner)Cons- Sometimes has very long waiting times to find a server, especially if you are solo queuing- Can become very repetitive- Small community (only ~300 active players!)End NoteThis game is a hidden gem amongst all of these larger titled games, and it deserves some recognition. This is a game that is especially fun if you play with a group of friends, and it's coming out with a huge DLC soon, so buy the game and get the community big again!			",34,3,0,4,1,0,1

Guns of Icarus: ""Balloon Warfare""Reviewed by Baylze, Member of Thought BubbleOverviewGuns of Icarus puts you as a crew member on one of many blimp/balloon designs. You'll fight it out in the skies as a mechanic, gunner or captain, and quite frankly, you'll love it if you're a fan of alternate team deathmatch games. There isn't much that is more satisfying than watching a blimp simply get shredded by your ships firepower, I'll tell you that much.GameplayYou're in first person, waltzing around your ship, smashing things with wrenches and hammers, streaming gunfire into enemy ships or piloting your ship at the captain's seat! All three of the things you can do on your ship are truly enjoyable to do. You'll feel like you're truly part of a crew, and helping to run the machine, especially when you win the game. This title does a really great job of capturing epic gameplay and true aesthetic.Graphics & SoundThe graphics aren't absolutely out of this world, I'll tell you that. As for the sound, it's VERY pleasing. The ambience is really generated by the old-time graphics and the genuine sounds to really create the atmosphere of Guns of Icarus. That's what the Graphics & Sound does.ReplayabilityPlay to your hearts content! Because this game is multiplayer driven, the only person who can hold back the replayability is you or the player base!MultiplayerIt's based around multiplayer. It works, and it works well.  Game Feature Rating (/10)   Gameplay 8/10   Graphics & Sound 8/10   Replayability 10/10   Optimisation (Options Menu) 9/10   Value for Money ($9.99) 8/10   Overall 9/10 Thanks for reading!Baylze, Thought Bubble			",81,4,0,1,14,0,21

												I got this game in a Humble Bundle.This is an online, team-based steampunk game where 4-prople crews battle it out on flying boats for number of kills or capture points.As a player, you have 3 characters, each with a different role, and can switch them between matches. Customization includes clothing, hairdos, and a series of items/ammo/boosts classified by roles.The heart of every ship is the captain, who needs to steer the ship, draw strategy and communicate effectively with the rest of the crew and allied captains. A skilled captain is crucial to success. Their items deal with driving the ship and finding enemies.Meanwhile, Engineers are the lifeblood that keep the makeshift boats flying. While it's usually the dullest role, it's crucial to avoid early termination. Their objects all deal with repairing the ship, with a bit of buffing.Finally, Gunners are the easiest path to learning the game. While it's very easy to set on a gun and shoot at enemies, the skill ceiling, range finding and ammo selection make it a more nuanced task.Incomplete crews get manned by AI, who are slightly competent at their jobs but lack the adaptability of actual players.While the game has everything it needs, there's a slight lack of map variety and game styles.It would be awesome to have a scavenger hunt match type (digging into the theme of salvaged relics from wastelands), and a boss-style battle against giant ships manned by foreign potencies.Weapon and ship balance has been an ongoing stuggle, as minmaxers find overpowered matches, and a few ships with proven effective loadouts are the norm. Still, the game gets frequent updates and rebalances.The worst part is the small playerbase. Would be awesome if this could get more players to populate the server.			",126,17,1,29,13,2,33

												Before I start, I would like to say, I love this game so much. The Game is AWESOME, the experience is GREAT. It's all about teamwork, not like the other so called ""co-op"" games where one player can make a difference. In this game, the whole team has to pull their weight.Although the game is so great and special, not many players seem to take notice... That's a pitty because the player community of this game is just wonderful. I haven't played it so much at the time of this review but in every game there was someone really helpful and fun to play with. The community isnt that big, so then I would like to encourage anyone who reads this.. buy the game, you WON'T regret it the game is a blast. Tell your friends about it and everything just play the game and see you in the skies :) And now for the Devs. :guys you do really great work I have to admit, not many devs keep their games perfect entire time and this game trully is. But please try to lure more players in, maybe lower a price, maybe a sale, expand the community everything will help. Either this or the commuity will die... and that wouldn't be fair for anyone who loves this game. Neverethless I am going to buy the Alliance and hope to see many improvements from you guys. Keep this special masterpiece of a game Perfect. Thank you :)			",85,9,1,14,23,1,32

Game is not without it's short comings, it has a tight-nit community, small but dedicated. Pros: trolls, griefers, and all around abusive people don't last long and get frosty welcomes... Cons: it does at certain times of the day take a few minutes to get a match going. Also you might find yourself on a team of low experienced players as the other team gets a little stacked, but hey, the real fun is in the challenge. Get salty, get back in the game, and get revenge!  ...Lastly, just want to shout out to Muse games for sticking with it and staying dedicated to their vision; Alliance is looking beautiful, can't wait .

												9/10Setting out from Firnfeld a young captain seeks his fortune trading among the clouds, over time building up his trusted crew of misfits to seek out new lands and test their mettle against those who would challenge their might and fearlessness.Yeah basically you fly around and blow up other people cuz why not, solid gameplay, the basics are easy to learn, the community is friendly and the ramming, the ramming is oh so good. The game supports many playstyles witht he exception of lone-wolfery, it is a team game.The game is much better with friends but if you dont already have some you'll make plenty in game, my best advice is not to rush to get out of novice matches (it's currently very easy to not be counted as a novice) adn take advice from others.Example gameplay aboard Hats off to the BullLord Anubus ""shouts incoherently"" while shooting the enemy with the boomskiesNateleigh ""my enginnnnnnnesssss, HUUUUUULLL"" while running in a circle fixing everythingCommanderStealth ""smush smush, SMUSH smush, SMUSH SMUSH"" while incinerating othersmichael.hauda (me) ""just a little faster.. (whispers the chorus to Hats off to the Bull to myself)"" while flying directly into my foes :3Also, the game isnt pay to win, which is amaaaaaaaaazing; new players are only at an experience handicap (you only gain cosmetics by leveling)			",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Captain's Log Day One: After many years as an officer in the Royal Air navy, mostly commanding the guns, I have finally been promoted to the rank of Post-Captain and I have been given my first command. My first command is to be ""The Maelstrom"" a beautiful, new, Goldfish. The guns are in good order, the engines are working like a dream, and it comes with an excellent crew of loyal, hardy, and well disciplined Sailors and Officers. I look forward to making a name for myself with this ship.Captain's Log Day Two: We were given commerce raiding duties in the Fjords along with a small Flotilla of two Pyramidions, one Spire, and one Junker. We managed to take several merchant ships without a fight but then came upon several enemy vessels. The Pyramidions rushed forward and acted as the vanguard while myself and the Junker stayed farther back. The Pyramidions received heavy damage as the enemies had, unknown to us until now, a Galleon. Using my ship's heavy weapons, we disabled its engines and guns, and it was finally taken down by our Junker. With their flagship lost, the rest of the enemy attempted to flee. We were able to capture one Junker and one Squid. We sailed back to port with out prizes in tow, and gave our report to the Admiralty. We were given many commendations, and I myself was gifted with an engraved sword. We will remain at port for a week.Captain's Log Day Nine: My Men drank, sang, and ♥♥♥♥♥d the week away, spending most of their pay. I, meanwhile, spent most of the week in my Cabin, quietly reading and going over charts and ledgers. The prize money, when split amongst the three Captains was still a substantial sum. When I awoke this morning I was given my orders. We are to intercept a raiding fleet in the Fjords.Captain's Log Day Ten: What had happened? When my men were to supposed to report today, there were only three! My two gunners, and my engineer. My entire crew has disappeared except for the four of us! Who could fly a ship with only four men?Captain's Log Day Eleven: The Admiralty has ignored my pleas and told me that the rest of the fleet has already left port and that I should join them. Well, I guess three men is better than none.Captain's Log Day Eighteen: After several long days of flying, we have finally found our target. We started chasing them at eight bells this morning, and, knowing they were outnumbered, they fled. We were able to seperate three ships though, a Squid, a Pyramidion, and a Spire. Using our main gun, our heavy Hwatcha, we destroyed the Spire in a matter of minutes. The Pyramidion and Squid quickly followed suit. We attempted to find the rest of the fleet, but it seems as though these ships that now lie at the bottom of the fjord were sent to delay us while the rest of the fleet gave us the slip.Captain's Log Day Twenty Two: I have begun to suspect that my crew has gone mad. Today we encountered an enemy Goldfish, and rather than follow my orders and do their duty, my Engineer kept trying to use the flamethrower, a weapon that he is not trained to use, when he was not manning the flamethrower, he kept trying to buff the guns while our engines were on fire. He did not, even once, repair anything. My gunner kept using the Gatling gun rather than our ship's main gun, and my other gunner just stood in one place, not moving or speaking. In fact, he didn't do anything. I firmly believe that the sun has gotten to him. We only won because of my expert piloting skills, destroying their balloon with our ship's spike.Captain's Log Day Twenty Five: I am at my wit's end. My engineer has started talking nonsense, constantly ranting about some fellow named, ""Trump"" and how he's going to ruin some strange land called ""Merica"" and screaming at the top of his lungs at any other who disagrees with him. My secondary Gunner has remained in the same area. He occasionally complains about ""lag"" whatever this ""lag"" he speaks of is, I do not know. My first gunner always fires the Heavy Hwatcha too early, and never follows my orders, constantly calling me a ""♥♥♥♥♥♥y♥♥♥♥♥noob."" I swear that none of these men are the original crewmen that this ship originally had.Captain's Log Day Forty Three: I have lost all hope. It is not worth even working any more. My engineer never fixes anything anymore, my Secondary gunner has disappeared. My first gunner constantly runs around trying to fix things, while completely ignoring the guns. It is so much that I have taken to the drink in order to drown my sorrows. To make matters worse, the fleet that we missed last month has moved into our capital city and I have been called to defend the city against  the onslaught. The best I can hope for now is an honorable death and to rid the world of the most incompetent sailors the sky has ever seen.Captain's Log Day Fifty: We arrived in the city and found that an entire fleet had besieged the city. I moved into the center, hoping for an honourable death and, to my surprise, my crew performed exceptionally. They followed ever order, kept the ship running, and destroyed all of the enemy ships. My ship, the Maelstrom, has singlehandedly saved the city.Captain's Log Day Fifty One: We have all been made heroes. Every admiral wishes to meet us, we have been given every medal for valor, we have all been given a fortune in prize money, and the Queen herself has personally knighted all of us in thanks. There have been many parades and balls in our honour. My men have all been made officers, and I have been promoted to the Rank of Rear Admiral. I know not by what power, but somehow, my crew, consisting of three people, did horribly, but finally did well when they were most needed.			",47,3,0,8,4,0,5

												I like Bubbles (Howard Toser), I've had conversations with him and he turned out to be a genuine guy and I really wish him the best of luckI understand it may be hard to find proper moderators/staff for your game because they are so pressured to join clans to enjoy the game.Like I said before, there are a couple of clans that completly ruin the GOIO community and even worse they have ambassdors and moderators in them while they are being led by dim-witted players.I've played the game, i've several hundred hours in it and I just think that right now this is how your average experience in the game will be:Male Player? - Get gud (after countless abuse and losses against stacked lobbies) and somehow join one of the clans that tryhard if you wish to win, also those clans that stack will most likely flame you for losing even when they are in the other side.It's not fun playing against obnoxiouse players, and neither is with them.Female player? - You will be hit on by the clan leaders or clan recruiters and in the GOIO Community they'll try to get you into their clan as soon as possible while filling you with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about other clan(s) (possibly) and trying to keep you all ""for themself"".Human's shouldn't be treated as cattle and being a female player you'll feel pressured from all sides, people who you thought are your friends are likely people who are trying to get you into their clan to attract more players or just feel like a womanizer.Also, regardless of you being any good or bad you'll still be hit on more than any other game - its unlikely you'll be flamed or called names until you reject their offer, that is. Right now, there have been several attempts to bring life back to the game, several bribes to famouse youtubers and events which are not bribes mind you, however the new player influx just dosen't stick because those said clans are so toxic that in a couple of games you'll feel that everyone hates you and since its a small community and 1/4 of the community is in a clan or been in a clan, they probably do.That's my opinion of GOIO (Guns of Icarus Online), G'Day.

												This is a one of a kind game, with great potential. You play the part of a crew member of a flying ship, teaming up with one or two allied ships against the enemy fleet. The graphics and gameplay are very good, there is always a lot of people to play in the lobbies and the community is great. It only lacks a single player campaign mode for now, but this may change in the future. Highly recommended!			",989,161,18,62,39,11,105

												Short version:+GREAT community +noob-friendly mechanics+very complex mechanics for advanced players +alot of fun +Innovative tip box+Innovative in-game guide ( books )+AWESOME ships to play ( i would recommend Junker it`s a great piece of ( scrap- ) metal! )+beautifully designed maps ( and i am someone who doesnt really look at maps too much )+lots of ways to communicate and work together+great customization options on ship and player ( you can even set your language for voice commands )+great to play with friends!+Artemis light rocket launcher ( pointed at your enemy )+the devs are quite nice+get free stuff by fighting the devs at a designated Event-you may wait some time to join because it cant find any other players ( but hey, atleast the tip box gives you cool jokes to laught about )-if you dont cooperate you have a 89% chance to lose the match -you need some time to figure out how to command the AI -recoil jitter applies to your camera-you cannot paint your guns ( only your airships )-Artemis light rocket launcher ( pointed at you )-The Manticore Heavy Hwacha may startle your gunner the first time they fire it ( if your a good    teammate just give them a heads up! ) if you need someone to play with my ingame name is dpf.Longer version:Are you good at playing in Teams? Do you like driving huge Vehicles in Video games, together with your friends?Do you frequently use voicechat?Then this is the game for you!Don´t be fooled by the small playerbase. There are just as much  nice players in this game as in other games. But if there are the same Amount of nice players in GOIO as in other games, but less players than those other games, then that results in a higher percentage of nicer players in GOIO as in other games ( i won´t go into details what those other games are.. *cough* everyfpsgameever *cough* ) <at this point of the review i noticed, that i haven´t said anything about the actual gameplay yet>Well, what can I say about the gameplay........from the individual players perspective it is very immersive! If you play well, as your class, then you can get a lot of ......For example, if you are good at playing as the engineer ( :engi: ) then you will......If your good at captaining ( :Pilot: ) then you can........If you are great at playing gunner ( :gunner: ) then you surely will get a ton of........Why do I have no clue about this?! I recently even won a tournament held by the steam group I am in! ( german steam group: Bootsmänner ) Oh, i know!If your act out your specific role on your ship and like repairing the right parts of the ship as the :engi: or taking out the right components on the enemy ship as the :gunner: or flying very well as the :pilot: then you are able to.....well.... win against AI bots. But you said this game was easy and cool and you won a tournament?  The answer is simple: There is no 'you' in the Title of this game! There is  an 'I' in the Title of this game which stands for 'I am a idividual member of my captains crew, so I have to do my job the way my team needs me to'  To sum it up, there is just one thing I can say about the gameplay: TEAMWORK WINS WARS!!!And thats a fact!Seriously though, I won a match against high level opponents by HAVING SMALLTALK with my gunner the entire match!! ( and since im not a native english speaker and have to 'learn' that in School, this made my grades go up!) So would i recommend this game? DO YOU EVEN READ BRO? If its too long, there is a shot version above this.I would definitely recommend giving this game a try, even if you have already played it. The developers are very nice and update the game quite often. They even join matches sometimes and play some matches with you.And yes, yes, this game has a shop where you can buy stuff with real money and yes its not that cheap, as you would imagine. And I even admit to buying one or two things from the shop! I want to support the devs, so I bought a cosmetic item. Let me rephrase that: I CHOSE to BUY the item, instead of logging in at a 'fight the devs' event and EARNING A FREE ITEM FROM THE SHOP by winning against the devs. See? There may be an in-game shop for cosmetic items, but all Tools are available from level 0. And the stuff that is locked is because those are very confusing for new players. ( honestly, if you have seen a lvl 1 player walking around on a Galleon, having no clue that the ship has 3 decks, then you would understand what im saying)Also: LEVEL DOESN`T MATTER! You can (theoretically and practically ) win a game against a full lvl 45 captain and crew with a crew of lvl 2-5 players if you coordinate them well. Why am I so sure about this? Because I have already done that a couple of times!This basically concludes my review of Guns of Icarus Online and I encourage you to play the game if you get a chance to!  And to all the ppl who got this far: Achievement get!: 'That´s a lot of text'			",20,2,0,1,2,1,2

So dont blame me for making some mistakes here and there ;)One of the best if not the best multiplayer game i have played so far. When you first enter the game lobby (yes as the title suggests its an online only game) you will probably be surprised by the low player count (50-400 people) and think the game is dying. But when you look it up on the internet (steam stats) you will find that its always been that way for years now (apart from some peeks here and there) without a big relevant overall decline in player counts. In this game you play as an engineer, captain or a gunner keeping an airship (chosen by the captain) up and running and shoot other airships or capture strategic positions. Matches are rather fast paced : 15-20minutes on average. And now i get to the pros and cons. Just one more note: you definitely shouldnt be shy to talk to strangers via voice chat because every crewmember depends on each other to keep your airship running.Pros:-great multiplayer game where communication between crewmembers and allied captains is key-enough ships and weapons for several tactical variations and counters-possibilities to either voice chat with crew, team captains (only as a captain) or all players in a lobby (not ingame)- a very helpful community that teaches novices/new players-small but overall friendly and helpful community (the most friendly community i have come across so far in a game)-Community ambassadors trying to answer question (for example in global chat)-active developers that are keen on keeping the game balanced and even add more stuff (not only tweeks, skins and clothes, there should even be more gamemodes coming up soon)-an ideal game to find more steam friendscons:-the community can be pretty small at times (varies from around 50-400 people online)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The community is awesome, they want to teach and contribute so that the game has a bright future. Guns of Icarus has active developers that test, balance and implement things constantly. Guns of Icarus has community run events every weekend and also tournaments that are run by the developers, the game as a whole is very underrated and I really hope to see you in the skies.

												There are over 9000 (ha) reviews already, so I'll try put something else in.I was reading about Nintendo's business philosophy recently, called ""Blue Ocean"". Basically instead of creating a competitive product, you create a product where you already have the complete share because no one has created anything like it yet.This is what Guns of Icarus is. Its created such an engaging and different game that as a result, its already got a controlling stake in anything airship related because not only is it the only working product (there have been a few other airship games, all pretty mixed to bad), but its had so much dedicated consistent attention to it that you can't help but fall in love with it a little. The mechanics are fluid and responsive, and each class has a genuinely different play style, the community is dedicated, diverse and filled with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, as most communities are. But more importantly they're actually there and you're not left to ghost servers. Finally the devs just give so much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game that its hard not to root for them.Good for them, and good for you if you buy this. Even if its not your cup of tea, its one hell of an impressive game work.			",243,93,4,29,25,4,54

												Yes, this game is a gem. A raw gem. A flying, buning, shooting raw gem with great engineers on deck.But why do i consider it raw and since when do gems shoot?Well, raw because there are many features promised that aren't in the game yet. Like the Co-op mode i'm awaiting for about 2 years. But don't get me wrong. That shouldn't be criticism. In my opionion the developers should take all the time they need to give the players a well polished experience and for now Guns of Icarus Online is great in what it is. I also hope you forgot about the gem question already.So what is it now?Guns of Icarus Online is a really great, tactial, team based Multiplayer. There are 2-4 ships on each team. Each ship has a crew that usually made of 1 captain, 1 gunner and 2 engineers. Sometimes 2 gunners and 1 engineer but that's an exception. Anyway the captain flies, the gunner shoots and the engineers panic... um... repair everything.There are muliple ships, multiple guns you can put on the ships and a huge variety of tools and ammo for different situations.You can not shoot people on enemie ships and you are bound to your ship. That means your only goal is to destroy the enmy ship. Well you can jump off the ship but that only results in a long fall and respawning.The game is easy to learn but hard to master.You can level each class mainly by making achievements but that doesn't give you any gameplay benefits. It just unlocks cosmetic stuff you can also buy from the store (real money) or win from matches against the developers. Yes, the developers are playing their own game. That's a huge plus!The graphics are beautiful. The character animation not so much but who cares? I'm an engineer! All i see during a game are broken shipparts and fire! Well i don't like the rain animation on the ships but meh. Fog still looks awsome.So what are the bad things?There are only three things i have to mention.1. Low population. Don't get me wrong. You will always find a game but very rarely on the european server. That's not too bad because the game still runs great with a ping of ~150.2. If your crew is bad it can get annoying. But that's the way of team based games isn't it? I highly recommend to get some friends to play with you so you have at least 1 full ship of people you can shout at in your native tongue. Or... just don't take the game too serious...3. It can get repetitive. Go to lobby. Wait for the game to start. Blow up ships/get blown up. Repeat. I recommend to play it from time to time with friends and not 24/7 with strangers to prevent this issue.7,8/10 because the hull is on fire...again!			",255,51,1,51,28,3,31

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.That's what this game's metascore is. To put this masterwork in the same figurative room as Defiance is beyond horrendous and the gaming review community, professional critics and vocal gamers alike, should be ashamed of themselves for that 64% average. This is easily a game most people would put well into the 80%'s for what it is.What is it you say? GoIo is a cooperative airship combat game where 4 players take on the role of crewing modest dirigibles, armed to the teeth of course, across a beautiful and majestic original world...and blow each other apart. You know all you should need to at this point. $15, under $10 during sales, buy 3 get 1 with the 4 pack. Give this game a go, you shall not be disappointed.			",96,12,0,11,7,0,27

Product received for free
												I've played this game for 7 months now and I love it to the bottom of my steampunk heart. I can't ask for a more involving airship game that truly makes you feel a part of the team. The sense of self-awareness you get after just playing for an hour makes you feel important and needed. And you are, especially when there's the broadside of a Galleon facing you! Pilot your airship, shoot your guns, and repair your beauty of an airship, because you're gonna be wanting back up soon! Up to four people per ship and 4 ships per team! Several different ships to choose from and many varieties of weapons and strategies to help you win!I wrote this back in July, and it is now September. I admit I don't play as much (because school) but I'm still going online because, despite the updates going slowly, this game is improving in both community and gameplay. I still love it and it is still my favourite game.A year has come and gone since I first got the game and I've now signed up to be a community ambassador. I still can't play the game as much as I used to, but I'm in love with it still.			",8,3,0,1,2,0,1

												Received as a gift from one of my fellow clan members in another game (Block N Load), tried it, immediately became addicted, half the clan is now playing.Though I haven't nearly as much as many other reviewers I can see the game is overflowing with potential, be it disastrous fails (like slamming our gold fish into the side of a galleon in a desperate attempt at pushing them off an objective), or harrowing victories (""Oh God what's on fire?"" ""EVERYTHINGGGGG..... wait, we won?""). The laughs and losses in this game are something I'd reccommend to anyone who: A) Loves the steam punk style or B) Has ever had the desire to slam a giant metal hunk precariously hanging from a balloon into other precarious death traps at full speed.

Good game - but quickly gets boring.You wonder why? Because gameplay is slow - which is not bad thing, but when you're engineer you only run on ship's deck and whoop things...It's boring after couple hours - and if you don't have friends, you might get whooped by people who play premade and refuse to go split among different teams... I will still recommend the game, despite low player-base, because it was fun for some hours...If you want to play it - grab on sale ",449,152,17,46,42,7,48

												If you love everything steampunk and feel like there's something missing in your life - it's probably Guns of Icarus Online.The most outstanding and unique positive aspects of GOI are:-Wonderful community for both casual and hardcore gamers alike-Heavy emphasis on teamplay and communication-Gameplay based purely on skill and a bit of experienceThe main downside of the game is that this wonderful community is relatively small. Although there is always someone playing, there are times of the day when (or time zones in which) games are hard to find. This may either improve or get worse with time though considering the devs strategy I'll assume it'll get better.			",153,27,5,8,15,0,25

-Quick Review-Guns of Icarus Online is an online multiplayer only game. You can choose between 3 jobs: Engineer, Pilot/Captain, and Gunner. There are a variety of ships you can fly, some that fly fast, and others that have great armor but are slower. -Detailed breakdown review-Story: At this time (April 05, 2014) there has been talk of an adventure mode where there is actually a story, but at this time there is no story (If there is, it’s in those manuals that I glanced at and didn’t notice anything, the loading screen sometimes gives an interesting explanation about a map, so I wouldn’t be surprised if there is some type of story background.Game Play:  There are some excellent guides that explain more details about how to do the various jobs in Guns of Icarus Online, but basically the Pilot/Captain flies the ship, the gunner shoots the guns, and the engineer hits stuff with a hammer (fixes parts of the ship). There is an overlap so often times you see an engineer shooting guns, and a gunner repairing stuff. The Pilot rarely leaves the wheel though.The game is completely multiplayer, so at times it’s a long wait in a lobby or trying to quickly join existing games. It’s a pain but if you’ve ever wanted to be on an airship with your friends, this is the perfect game for you.Achievements: Something that I personally like about Guns of Icarus Online is their sense of progression and rewards. Guns of Icarus Online has a lot of achievements, do not expect to get these very fast, the game is meant to take up a lot of time, you can only repair something 150 so fast. Often times you need to play over various sessions and rounds to finally earn achievements.The value of earning achievements is that you also “level up”. For example, you need to get 5 achievements to get from engineer level 7 to level 8. As you level up the achievements get more difficult, however the challenge is very obtainable if you’re into getting achievements.Not only do you level up by getting achievements, you also unlock new equipment and dyes that you can use on your avatar so that you don’t look exactly like everyone else playing Guns of Icarus Online. If you’re really into aesthetics you can also pay real-money to purchase exclusive items… but anyone who knows me knows I’d personally never do that.Price: Guns of Icarus Online currently going for  $14.99, as I commonly say on my reviews, I prefer to wait for a sale before I purchase a game. However I will make an exception for this game. If you are looking for a game that will eat up your free time, this is the game.  (As of today – April 09, 2014 – I have played only 60 hours of the game, but I know that will probably increase to several hundred hours over the next year or so) So to rephrase my opinion: It’s a good game, $14.99 is too high for myself, but if you’re looking for a time eater this game will do that and its value is fair compared to the amount of time you can spend on it. Conclusion: Pro’s: The game will eat up free time, if you ever wanted to fly a ship or be part of a crew on a ship this game is excellent, there are many friendly people in the Guns of Icarus Online community, the game is dynamic and very unique compared to many other video games out there.Con’s: There is no hanging out by yourself, you cannot fly your own ship online and get grindy achievements – you must be with a crew of other people in a game, sometimes you have NPC’s instead but fundamentally you’re always online and unless you have a lot of friends playing with you, chances are you’ll have a rough time. Naturally whenever you’re playing a game with other people, you meet some good, some bad, and some worse. I’ve had to block elitists, little kids thinking their funny, and people who tend to yell over their microphones – you will have that happen to you, the best thing to do is block them and not crew up with them again.There is a lot to be said about the negative aspects of the game, but there is a lot to be said about the positive too. It’s just important to know what type of gamer you are, and how well you handle sociality… I personally don’t know if I should have gotten this game because I don’t handle being yelled at well. But I’ve made several good friends so I guess I think that’s worth it. :)			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

There's a growing set of competitive teams who are consistently doing their best to take this game to the next level.  Even if that's not your scene, it's a great game with a friendly atmosphere.  Unquestionably worth the money.  Customizable classes and ships you can adjust to fit your playing style. Buy a 4-pack and drag some friends in, or meet new people in the game. Whatever you prefer, this game has something for you.			",47,3,0,5,8,0,9

Now I spend the majority of my days begging my friends to drop everything and come play with me.15/10 We need more games like this.			",51,7,3,24,45,0,15

												Do you have a group of friends and you are tired of killing zombies and robbing banks? Do you want Co-op and PvP action? Is Steamboy your favorite anime movie? Then you should play this game. When I first played this game, I was amazed in how it captured the feeling of being on an open air-ship: the aesthetics, the clouds, the ship movement, the gunfire -all feel great.If you have friends then bring them with you or make friends in-game. The game has a large focus on community. The developers are talkative and there is a focus on clans. The community isn't TOO big so you may see a few captains again from time to time in which friendships and/or rivalries can form.			",274,91,2,33,12,3,42

												I've been playing Guns  of Icarus both alone and with friends, and I find it an amazing game. All three classes (Captain, Engineer, and Gunner) are fun to play, there is great weapons' and ships' variety, and as a result each match is normally a completely unique experience. 95% of the times: good fun!The community for the most part is really well-behaved, which helps, and I lost count of the times in which more experienced players gave me suggestions and tips. Apart from that, when my friends and I manage to fill a whole ship, it's always amazing: we coordinate easily and we become a deadly war machine! :--PIn any case, the built-in voice chat works well, and it helps the captain giving orders (although there are other ways: standard chat, and keyboards commands).I wish there were more players, so to reduce the time spent in the match lobby, but that's basically the only complain that I have. Super-recommended!!! Still good fun!			",97,60,0,9,5,1,8

												Co-op game that has a diffrent flair to it then the left 4 dead or payday games.  If you like those games then you will have fun with this one.  You and your freinds man the helm of a war blimp.  Engineers repair and gun gunners gun and pilots try not to crash and get blamed for failure.  When your team works together efficiently you can dominate, if you don't work so well together then your blimp with be skidding a long the ground getting pelted by what seems to be an armys worth of munitions.The game seems well balanced and I have not found any bugs, no performance issues.The only problem is It needs more people to play it, i don't think it has found the spot light yet...

												I don't normally write reviews . . . But when a not so popular game is this great, I just have to.First off, if you are thinkning about getting this game, DO IT! This is probably the most unique team based multiplayer game I've ever played. From the art and models to the gameplay, this game delivers in a special way. The game in a nutshell: Crews of four man one of the many different types of airships and battle the enemy airships in a variety of beautiful and detailed maps. Battles can range from 2v2 to 4v4. (4v4 dogfights are epic . . . Trust me. There are also different game modes.) There are three roles as a crewmember to choose from - the pilot, who flies the ship, the gunner, who mans the ship's main weapon, and the engineer who repiars the ship and mans other guns. (Most crews are made up of a pilot, gunner, and two engineers.)I love absolutely everything about this game. Its loads of fun working with your crew and fellow allies to blow the enemy out of the sky. The different classes, ship types, and weapons keep the game fresh. You can also customize your own character with various outfits (some you unlock, others you can buy.) Ships are also customizable to an extent. Just a tip: This game is all about the people you play with. If you have a vulgar or terrible crew, then you'll have a bad experience. My adivce would be to join a friendly, talkative clan as soon as possible. Having a nice clan and friends to play with is what really makes this game fun! :)			",25,4,0,5,2,0,6

												This game is one of the most phenominal ones I've ever played. Very complex yet simple at the same time, Guns of Icarus is a teamwork based game in which crew members crew a ship to kill other ships in 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 deathmatches as well as respective KotH and rotating CP modes, thus teamwork spans from the small intership scale to a teamwide scale, making the game both chalenging and enjoyable.Guns of Icarus has a steep learning curve in order to understand the game mechanics a curve similar to that of CS:GO or any other team based games. Basics are easily covered and managed through the tutorial but more advanced piloting and engineering tactics as well as gunner acuracy takes some time to learn, but take it from a seasoned player when I say the hard work does pay off.Additionally, Guns of Icarus has one of the greatest comunities on the internet, which is one of the reasons I've stayed here a while. I've met some of my greatest friends through this game as they taught me how to play and become just as good as them.Finally! I recomend reading the ""What Do?"" guide, that guide goes over some of the most important stuff to know in order to lower the learning curve, it tells you everything you need to know to A) Not♥♥♥♥♥♥off other people B) Not be a scrub and C) be way super MLG when just starting off.Good luck, and I hope to see you in the skies.That's all the important stuff, but if you want some more PRO MLG SWEG tips... just keep readingBefore you start playing against the big wigs, attempt to matchmake into only Novice Matches first to get a feel for a game, it'll be boring, but just playing 3-4 games will help you understand the game.If you really want to pilot, start out by just flying Pyramidions, they're the easiest ship to learn on as they're the most balanced and most used in the game, take your time, get good at one thing, and when you feel really ready (after 20-30 games) move on.Don't be an♥♥♥♥♥ If you're captain tells you to do something, do it, even if you disagree. It's better to follow orders and keep communicating rather than starting an argument and then dying because you weren't paying attention.If you need help! Message Me (IGN: -Blue-) ingame, and I'll help you out! I don't get on as much as I used to, mostly only for competative tournaments and practices so contact any SPQR clan memeber, we like to teach new players the ropes. :D (I learned to pilot with a stacked crew, makes life a lot easier when you can focus on one thing)HAVE FUN! <-- it's good to remember that this is just a game, and if you have a bad ally don't let it get you down, come back strong and do your best.

												A fantastic game for teamwork, there's nothing quite like it. The community is wonderful and there are always ways to deal with the parts of it that aren't. The developers are always quick to respond to emails and listen to feedback (provided it has nothing to do with boarding). If you don't have a group to play it with then find a crew that you like and work well with and stick around with them.While the game population (except during sales) may be low there are always matches running although the matchmaking can take a while.(I am a Community Ambassador for this game and am absolutely writing this of my own will, all hail Keyvias!)

												Normaly I don't throw my hat into these kinds of things but I do think some things need to be addressed.This game is by far an amazing game and if not for the slow development I would completly and wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a skill based team pvp . The game is very well balanced and brings something new to the table of multiplayer games but as stated by another avid fan of the game, it has been out for three in half years with little added in the ways of bringing the game new content. With this said the new DLC may bring more to offer and spice things up, maybe even bring the player bases back up but until then I will have to no recommend this. We need more honest reviews of this great game to push it in the direction of new content if we want it to change.Side note: I havn't seen the active players playing over three hundred in a long time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After about 3 games as pilot losing in total silence, I found a team of three that would actually cooperate with me. I added them as friends and we won six straight games in four hours, including one where our ally was replaced by AI (essentially 2v1).If you can communicate and cooperate, this game is heaven. Not very fast-paced, but extremely intense, strategic, and thoroughly bad♥♥♥♥♥ 11/10			",77,15,0,6,8,0,10

												A brilliant example of a game based on pure teamwork, Guns of Icarus scratches the itch of co-operation so lacking in popular games such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, or... almost any mainstream game. If you like strategy, and flying a diesel-punk airship between two broadsiding floating behemoths blasting a blistering blitzkrieg of bullets, surviving by sheer force of will to summon the winds of change and become the battered, slightly-on-fire victor held together by DUCT-TAPE AND GLORY, this game is for you!

												A really great steampunk universe airship combat game.The UI isn't always user friendly, levelling is unclear (based on acheivements) and the lag issues can be infuriating at times but this is a solid game with great mechanics. Make sure to have a group of friends handy to play this. You can get some good matches with randoms, but having a crew you know you can rely on in the heat of battle is the key to victory in this.Think of it as a bit like a Steampunk version of Artemis: Starship Bridge Simulator.

												Despite my relatively short time playing the game, I can definitely say that I recommend it, especially if you have friends willing to play it with you. Even if you don't have friends who want to play it, I'd still recommend it. It's a team based game where communication actually matters, unlike many of your modern ""team"" based games. (In which a single good player can carry an entire team.)The objective of a match varies from a mode where you must capture a point and defend it, to a simple deathmatch in which you must take down a set number of enemy airships, to something called a VIP Hunt, in which you must take down a specific enemy airship. To accomplish these goals, you're given a variety of ships (Seven, I think. If I'm wrong, I'll come back and edit this.) that range from the nimble Squid to the devestating but slow Galleon, and a variety of weapons ranging from a missile launcher that can fire twenty shots in a single barrage, to the classic flamethrower, to a ship-mounted sniper rifle, to numerous sorts of artillery.A crew consists of four people, each with an important role to fill on their ship. Crews are broken down into three classes.The Pilot is the captain of the ship, and brings various tools to improve different aspects of the ship. These tools, however, are not without a cost to the ship and will often damage whichever part is improved. (Much to the dismay of his engineers.) Using his stamina, he can also give the ship a temporary speed boost. I would only recommend this role to the more advanced or competent players. The Engineer is exactly what you think he is. They come equipped with the tools needed to repair, rebuild, buff, extinguish, prevent, and otherwise stave off your imminent destruction. By using their stamina, they can sprint across the ship to get where they're needed faster.The Gunner is also self explanatory. They bring three different types of ammo, each with bonuses and debuffs, that can be loaded into the ship's guns. Their stamina boost allows them to turn the ship's guns farther than any other class, and lets them reload faster.I'd break down the guns and ships, but that's a job best left to the wiki or guides. So, if you just scrolled down to the bottom of this, the game is one I highly recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a beautiful gem, especially when it comes to coop-PvP battles. I have no idea why this game doesn't get more attention.+ Great community+ Beautiful & detailed airships+ Really motivating combat mechanics, and a huge feeling of achievement after a battle has been won+ Teamplay: It's working REALLY well in 90% of the games. A crew of 4 players is easy to manage, and you can have a lot of fun with your team mates.Especially because of the voicechat feature. + Amazing sound and music. It's probably the most catching / enchanting music that I ever listened too in a game, and it's dynamic during a match as well.+ Easy to learn, hard to master (only with team play!)- The grahics of the enviroment could look better - but as soon as you are in battle you will only focus on the ships anyway, which are looking great. - Sometimes the matchmaking can take a while. But normally you will have a good chat (and laugh) with the other players that are waiting. (Just recently someone was reading a book, I think it was Henry Miller, and the others comment on the book and/or his reading skills. :P)Hints when starting:Get a headset / Use your headset. And DON'T start as a captain. PS: Since I was a kid I loved the idea of flying ships. Standing on the bow of your ship and scanning the horizon for enemies with your spyglass, while floating through clouds and listening to the wonderful music, knowing that soon the quietness will turn into a mess of flames, detonations and smoke, is definetely something among the best moments that I had in games so far. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting niche-game where hardcore shooting is traded in for teamwork. Half the time you will be running around your airship screaming to your mates that the engine / balloon / whatever is on fire, or worse.Good teamwork is rewarded and once you get through the learning curve of this game (which you shouldn't underestimate), this game proves to be rather enjoyable.On top of that, the community, albeit a bit on the smaller side, is very friendly, warmhearted and social.Feeling like trying out something else for a change?

												By far my very favourite game!The key to this game is communication. between the crewmembers, crew and their captain and between the captains, not only during the match, but already in the lobby!Add some tactics, coordination and use the map (hide in clouds, sneak around mountains and place tactical mines) and victory is yours :D+ Nice Steampunk style+ Different game modes that each require different tactics+ Friendly and helpful community, always ready to answer your questions, give advices, coach you or just have some nice chit-chatting. There are many different clans who will welcome you and help and teach you to get into the game.+ Devs keep adding content, balancing ships and weapons and helped me with every problem I had+ regular fun events (community and fight-the-devs) where you can win items or titles+ no pay2win nor play2win: everybody has the same chances, there is no upgrading or unlocking items that give you an unfair bonus, only stylish cosmetics are available. The outcome of the match is entirely based on skill, tactics, communication and teamworkI bought in on a sale for 2,50€ (actually a 4copy pack for 9,99€), but 11/10 would buy it again for the full price. I never spend money on cosmetics and skins, but here I plan on making an exception to support the Game ^^ ",18,13,0,0,1,0,0

												Guns of Icarus Online is a fully immersive, cooperative, and enjoyable steampunk-themed multiplayer game. I've never played a game where not only the community was genuinely so unique and great; but also has an endless amount of replayability. I am definitely looking forward look to furthing my involvement in the GuIO community, and the game itself. I would highly recommend this game at full price, but if you have the chance to catch this hidden indie-gem on sale; do yourself a favor and don't miss out on the GuIO experience.			",28,0,0,3,4,0,8

												I started playing solo and casually. I was a captain of a goldfish that I named ""Nachez Riverchaser""Playing alone, I gained a small reputation among the other loner captains. We would see each other in lobbies, wave hello, fly for a few matches, and then part ways.At this point, I was coming up to a skill level where I would be solo flying against clan fleets. It was hard. They had the organization, communication, and fostered skills that my little goldfish and her ragtag crew couldn't handle. After some asking around, I found a mid-sized clan who took me under their wing.I rose quickly through the ranks, learning oceans more about flying than I ever would have on my own. We were a well-respected clan (and still are, as far as I know). As my experience skyrocketed, so did the difficulty of the captains I flew against. This is the point where the matches, the load outs, the strategies -- all became ludicrous. I felt less like a Han Solo and more like a Chess Master. Our ship skirmishes became shorter, faster, and more aggressive. Eventually, raw skill (something I relied heavily on in my career) became less important. It was a thinking game, and I was pretty good at it. Not the best – not by a longshot, but pretty good.I loved every minute of it. I still do.I highly recommend this game to anyone. There's no statistical progression, levels mean nothing. It’s very forgiving for casual players. There are always waves of new players coming in. The experienced players are all very polite and eager to teach new players. The devs are also extremely invested in the community. It's loads of fun at every single skill level. I remember when I first started out, the spectacular skirmishes and explosions of Pyramidions as they clashed together in the clouds. And I love the ludicrous strategy that is needed for high ranking play. ",66,6,0,12,5,0,9

												Very cool game that incorporates coop and versus into one gamemode successfully. You join aboard an airship as one of four crew members trying to keep yours ship afloat in the midst of battle whilst gunning away on the enemies. It also has many tactical and strategical components to it as different weapons not only have different ranges and damage values but also excel at destroying the one or the other component.I'm just going ahead and say it: Guns of Icarus online is basically Faster Than Light multiplayer in a steampunk setting. Okay, there is no boarding or killing the enemy crew but everything else is in: destroying the armor (the shields) to do damage to the hull, destroying components to disable certain abilities of the enemy, i.e. the engines to remove their ability to maneuver.

Guns of Icarus Online, an amazingly well-put together game. I highly recommend this......however, having friends to play with would greatly help. Why?Guns of Icarus Online is a multiplayer FPS/Strategy game of sorts. Teams of 4 work together and manage an airship, one that is fitted with various weapons, perks, and/or stats that vary from airship to airship. The objective is simple: down enough enemy airships to reach the goal. However simple the objective may be, the game itself is a myriad of strategms. Teamwork is essential in this game; without it, a crew will not be able to perform at maximum capacity. However, with teamwork, skill, and a bit of luck on your side, your crew can turn a harmless looking airship into a powerful, dominating dirigible in the skies. The mounted weapons on each ship, coupled with the tools that each class is allotted, are quite balanced and fair. No slot should be left empty, everything must be carefully selected and used. The game itself is not difficult, nor is it frustrating. Rather, it is user friendly and has quite the low learning curve. The community in this game is quite friendly and very mature. No problems with it.			",107,9,4,8,8,3,5

												A game that doesn't look or feel like any other game. Cooperation and communication is the key to succeeding - in other words not a game for lone wolves and people just looking for action.Is this game for you?The learning curve is a bit steep for new players, which can make gameplay a bit frustrating if you end up with people not knowing what they're doing. My best advice is to use a mic and try to find higher level players to join. Also, make sure you do the tutorial before entering any matches, as you won't be able to work together with your crew mates if you don't understand what needs to be done. A cooperative level 2 player is most times preferable over a level 15 player who doesn't communicate, due to the importance of teamwork. If you do end up on ships with inexperienced players, try to stick it out... I think there are many out there who give up on this game too fast, simply because they don't really get a taste of what it really is. I've heard several people say ""Oh, so this is what this game is really about"" once they get to play with more experienced players.The gameplayWhen you're crewing a ship you'll hopefully get one or several main tasks from your captain. If you want to do a good job you'll want to stick to them, since the ship will most likely blow up if you don't. I can't stress this enough; It really is crucial that everyone on the ship do what they need to do in order for things to work. Joining (or forming) a clan is also good if you want to meet other cooperative players. Given that you're on a ship with a decent crew, this game is just brilliant. Cruising along a mountain side with a steampunk airship looking for enemy ships is a great pastime activity, and the game has so much to offer once you get hold of the basics.The bottom lineIf you like the concept, don't give up on the game too fast. You may just have had bad luck with the crew mates or captains.			",105,12,9,8,10,0,4

												A great game for those who love teamwork, strategy, communication, original physics and most of all, shooting a massive (and diverse) arsenal of steampunk weaponry at slow moving airships.Don't bother playing if you don't have a mic (and speak/write conversational-English) and a willingness to get your♥♥♥♥♥railed in the first month or two before learning how to properly prioritize, communicate, choose the right ammunition for the right gun/situation, and learn from your mistakes. If you aren't willing to learn from experienced players you will ruin everybody's day by being a burden on your ship so shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and listen to your elders. There is some room for creative approaches to gunships, ammunition and loadout once you gain some experience.The community is great but only really has a substantial number of players on weekends and weekday afternoons in my experience.

												Never played a game quite like it. There's a real sense of your personal responsibility as a member of the airship's crew to do as much as you can to keep it afloat and win the match, and it's exhilirating all the while no matter your role, yet a serenely beautiful experience.Strategy, tactics, and teamwork are the name of the game here, with personal skill meaning little if you have to pull the weight of the entire crew. Lots of ships and guns to choose from, the placement of guns on every ship customizable, making every team's airship approach the battlefield differently.Elegantly executed, extremely fun, and completely unique. Makes my boy parts tingle every time I play it.			",143,31,1,16,12,0,11

												At first glance at this game I will admit that I was skeptical, with a steampunk feel to the game that I wasn't sure I would quiet enjoy as well as a large margin for toxic encounters that could ruin the entire multiplayer value of the game (ex. LoL or Dota) but despite my preconceptions of what the game could be like I went ahead and played it. After a couple of hours the game blew me away. The community is amazing! This is the first multiplayer game I have enjoyed where teams cooperate happily to accomplish a goal. The game is absolutely satisfying getting a kill on another ship is no easy task and when your crew comes together and finally sends another ship plummeting from the heavens and to a fiery demise there is an overwhelming feeling of joy and comradery. While the game has a different graphics appeal than I am used to the developers managed to capture a sense of beauty in the sky as you fly to victory or death that can't be overlooked. Overall I would score this game to be 8/10 and well worth a buy because even if you don't have multiple friends to play it with the game still remains fun because of the in-game chat system that makes it easy to communicate with your crew.To conclude Guns of Icarus Online is a great game that is well worth the small fifteen dollars to join this amazing community that really enjoys playing a well designed game.

												The game is way, way better than the metascore might suggest. I'm going to assume the low score is there partly because when you start the game aren't too many maps you can choose from, giving an impression of a limited game. As I've understood it, this is only so that you get practice on the easier levels before you go and navigate in the really dangerous ones. Once you reach lvl 4 in any crew role you'll get plenty more and the selection is about as numerous and varied as most FPS games, Killing Floor for example. These include a desert with component damaging dust clouds, a water temple zone, a foggy fjord and an ambush oriented canyon. When I got the game, there were only two play modes, but the devs have been adding new ones like Crazy King. There is also a good variety of ships, guns, and tools to use in different roles as a part of the crew so you'll have a different kind of match to play everytime you get to it.The graphics are good, the art style beautiful and the gameplay very polished. Starting players will be aware of only a few basic approaches to battle but the more you play the more you start to understand the potential for different tactics, using all of your guns to their full advantage, coordinating with other ships on your team etc. The community is one of the friendliest online gaming communities I've personally interacted with, most everyone is there to enjoy the game. As always, some players will give others a piece of their mind though. Still, as a new player I got good advice from those with more experience and no one was bashing me for making noob mistakes. Newbies are also restricted to play with other relatively new players (you can opt out from this if you wish), so you propably wont be completely decimated even when you're learning the ropes.The current game is just skirmish mode (different online battle modes) but the developers are looking to release an adventure mode in 2015; imagine an MMO world with airships, factions, trade and quests and you propably have the right general idea. With what they've managed to do so far I do have confidence that the adventure mode will be a good product as well. They already have the ship-to-ship combat nailed down, all they need is to expand the world they have already visioned and you can find info about on their site.If you've ever thought gliding through the skies on an airship would be awesome, if you enjoy tactical cooperative play, or if you enjoy steampunk aesthetics I can highly recommend this game - I've had some of my most engaging and fun gaming experiences on it. If the themes don't make you feel excited but you like online team based multiplayer games, Guns of Icarus is still a solid choice but you may want to hope for another sale to get it.

												This is a really fun teamplay-based game. It's not your usual kind of mmo where the amount you pay will determine how far you can get in the gameworld. Here you purchase the title once, and after that everything depends on your skills and your team's level of cooperation. Item shop items are purely cosmetic stuff, and some of them are given away for free during character progression anyway.  Working together is essential in this game, and one of the aspects that new players don't always understand first, which is why early gameplay can get difficult and full of lost battles. On the other hand, you can be extremely skillful from the start, depending on how fast you are willing to learn the game mechanics. There are many useful guides around, and most high level players will be more than happy to tell you everything you need to know.  It's most fun with microphone, especially if you wanna be a captain, but I know many great players who do very well and enjoy the game without mics. Some people say that you can't succeed in this without real life friends playing with you, but that's not true, most people here play and become friends without ever having met in real life.Yet, I'd recommend building an in-game friend list as soon as you start, adding people you had fun with, as the game gets more and more enjoyable and personal if you fight with familiar folks, and not always with completely new crew members.Gameplay and fighting system has a great variety and allows for numerous combinations. You can select ships, weapons, tools, maps, and all of these will determine the outcome. Because of that, preparation in lobbies can get long and tiresome sometimes, even boring, if you wanna play fast, but great victories always require great planning and preparation anyway, so consider it a part of gameplay to discuss strategies while you wait for teams to fill up. Don't forget that this is partly a strategy game, even though it offers action as well, and you gotta discuss tactics with your team at one point, and lobbies are the perfect places for that. Many people complain about the community and its rules being too restrictive, but most rules that the community guidelines include are perfectly normal and basic considerations asking for perfectly normal and basic human behaviour, such as ""please don't spam and troll the global chat with profanity and/or racist comments because nobody is interested in them"". The difference compared to other games is that here the community takes an active part in making sure that these guidelines are not just empty words on the game's website, but are actually kept in-game. Altogether this game is truly exciting, gives a new experience each time you fly, since nothing will be the same twice. Crews, captains, ships, maps, everything changes with each match, and that makes every battle feel unique. Also, for steampunk lovers, it's a must! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of icarus is a competetive game with 2 layers of teamwork.Layer 1.You and 3 others are in an airship and keeping it up to destroy two others. Basicaly, you are either an engineer, gunner or the pilot. Work togheter to be a good ship.Layer 2.Mainly, the game is 2v2 (2 ships vs 2 ships) so not only do you work on your own ship, your ship should be helping the other ship.Put that on the other team also and you got hell of a competetive game.It is actually a very very good competetive game in a completely different fashion than the usual strategy or fps. Its both in a way.It can be quite confusing when starting the game out, not doing anything is worse than bots so Do the tutorials and read or watch guides/gameplay. And you will get the jist.It is an amazing game to start seriouse on as it complements working togheter very very well.			",231,42,0,25,5,1,10

												I got this game because my son wanted to play it. I bought the 4 pack and played it with them. When there's a group playing together, it can be lots of fun. Playing by yourself is a challenge though because sometimes you have to wait a long time for enough people to gather to play a game. Also, because the community is so small, it tends to be serious about the game, which can make it less fun for casual players and those who aren't as familiar with different aspects of ship-to-ship fighting in game. Mostly people don't do the jobs they're supposed to do, which can make it impossible for you to win or even do the job you're supposed to do. For instance, sometimes the pilots don't pilot or the mechanics get on guns that the gunner should be able to access but can't because somebody who should be repairing the ship actively isn't doing that. Having said that, if you have a group of people who might like to play this together, it can be fun. It can also be fun on those rare occassions when you get serious players who aren't jerks to newcomers. Take it for what it's worth.			",135,27,5,27,19,0,17

												Had this collecting dust on my Steam list for months, actually cannot remember where I got it..Kind of regret it as I have had a blast playing it for the last few days.Guns of Icarus is a Steam punk themed Airship vs Airship combat game.You play a member of a 4 man or women crew of an Airship.Classes:Captain/Pilot - Commands the vessel and steers the ship.Gunner - Makes things go Boom, captains ♥♥♥♥♥.Engineer - Makes Boomed things Unboomed, captains other ♥♥♥♥♥.Each class has a selection of specific Perks and Ammo types they can use to be effective.With three load-outs configurable per class you should be able to have what you need going into battle.Communication is key here.Progression:There is progression in this game, but you basically only unlock cosmetic items.In-Game Store:Cosmetics ONLY, Dye, Clothing Slot Items, Decals for Ships.Air Ships:There is a few different Airships to choose from.Each are balanced differently in Speed, Agility, Firepower and Armour.Each with a different number of mounting points for guns and different ratings for heavier weapons.Pilot Gameplay:You sit at the helm, steer the wheel, control speed and the altitude of your ship as well as coordinate your team with your plan of attack.. i.e ""Preparing to engage TheEnemy1 Starboard Bow, Man the forward guns, focus TheEnemy1"", ""Rep the engines, going burning full power!""For the most part the Captain should never leave the wheel.Gunner Gameplay:Listen to Captain, observe and spot enemies with scope, engage where possible with mounted guns.Gunners should have priority over weapons as engineers should be more interested in repairs and the captain should be on the wheel.Engineer Gameplay:Listen to Captain, observe and spot enemies when not repairing or buffing, if no damage and guns available to use engage enemy to assist with DPS but prioritize repairs unless otherwise told.There is a good amount of stuff to repair / buff so unlike the gunner you should be running around like an ant whacking the: Armour/Hull, Balloon/Pump, Middle Drive Engine, Port & Starboard Maneuvering Engines and the 4-5 odd guns that are on each ship.In closing:Great fun game, worth its current $15 entry fee.Communication is key to getting the most out of this game.Great fun with four friends to man a ship.Not a huge player base with 800-1400 online at different times.Average wait time for a game queue is generally not bad.Not a huge Oceanic player base so you will find yourself on US server but game does ok with rubber banding only seemingly kicking in around 350-400ms latency.

												I have played this game for over a year now, and it's amazed me how I keep coming back to it. So here's my over-due review.This game is heavily based around teamwork; your task each game is to communicate with your crew - that consists of 3 other real people - and other ships on your team to effictively destroy your enemies. There are a range of maps that include beautiful landscapes and post-apocalyptic scenery, where you must navigate and fight. Currently there are 3 game modes: Deathmatch, King of the Hill, and Crazy King. (The last two basically being capture the point). Teams can go as high as 4v4, and as low as 2v2 and each ship holds 4 crew members with a total of 7 different and interesting ships to fly. There are also 3 classes; Pilot, Engineer and Gunner. Each person takes on their role and performs their duties aboard their ship, whether they are the Pilot who has control over the ship and co-ordinates with their allies, or the Engineer who must keep the ship alive and shipshape. Or even a gunner who's speciality is manning the many guns and many ammo types. Either way, teamwork is key in this game.New players are recommended to play the tutorials which give a basic understanding of how the game mechanics work. But don't fret, you wont be thrown into the deep end as soon as you start playing. There are a host of servers that only Novice players can enter so that new poeple can learn together with other new people and better learn the game. But the help doesn't stop there. This game's community is simply fantastic. Those who are willing to learn are easily taught by the veteran players and even the game's own version of teachers called Community Ambassadors - picked by the Muse team - who love to teach. So if you like to troll and be really rude and obnoxious, this game is not for you. But if you're looking for a fun game with great people, look no further ;)			",48,8,2,6,12,1,1

												Guns of Icarus Online.Game-Wow. This game is truly one of my favorite games. This whole bioshock inf. themed game (as so it seems) really goes good with the whole steam ships fighting. Love the terrian on the maps, great use of the enovirment such as a map were your in the desert and if you go into the dust it messes up your engine and all your other parts because of the dirt and dust getting into all the little parts.Other players/CrewThis is a VERY heavy depended game which if your crew is not all on the same page then it will show in your proformence.-Gunner This class is the firepower of your ship. Must be a good shot with cannon's/Galiting guns/Shotguns. He has the powers to change the ammo type, whether is be fire rounds or rounds that will fly fast and hit hard, but have a lot more bullet drop. Use them wisely and you will have a huge lead over your emeny.-Engi. Besides the pilot this is the most important job on the ship. When your ship on fire or needs a lot of repairs quick and fast the engi will take care of them if they know what they are doing. Your ship can go from good to bad in seconds and your engi needs to be on their feet and aware on whats going on.-Pilot This is normally the captain of the ship. It doesn't matter if you have the best crew if your pilot is not a good one or at least he knows what their are doing then you are completely screwed.8.5/108.5 because if you get in a game with a bad crew then it just takes out of the game. But there is really no fixing that.Ways that I would love this if this was a free roam game and you go to a area and PVP and just be able to sail around a huge open world game and buy and sell with other players and do quest. Yes it sounds like I'm talking about a totally different game but that's what I say about making a new one			",82,5,0,8,8,1,1

												Guns of Icarus is an outstanding example of how a kickstarter project can be the new revolution of PC gaming. Truly immersive graphics and audio grabs the player and thrusts them into the middle of a explosive steam-punk universe that many gamers have been craving for. This game shines when it is played with friends as crew.I absolutely love this game despite what most critics think.This game provides hours upon hours of competitive, complex entertainment that only few could get tired of. Customize your player, airship, and take to the high skies as either a mechanic, gunner, or pilot. Your loadouts and skill will lead you to victory or certain defeat. Numerous maps, achievements, and tons more to enjoy, one can easily spend hundreds of hours competing for victory in this action-packed game.However despite its visual beauty and impressive execution, limited gameplay and general bugginess makes the ride a bit bumpy. This beast still has room to grow.			",2267,868,87,236,310,22,349

												A very engaging game that has 3 core themes:Teamwork, Risk, and Strategy all tied together with the concept of Steampunk combat in mind.The game has a great atmosphere, a very active and egaged dev team (who often host player vs dev events), a very active community ambassador group, and an overall friendly community. Sales are often, which provide an ample opprotunity to acquire this game.I would reconmend buying a 4 pack so you and your friends can play, and I would reconmend having a mic. That way, you will be able to communicate with other players on your team during a match and devise complicated stratagies and plans. Or decide to just rush the enemy. Whatever works :DGreat game, would reconmend for those who like guns n boats.			",38,1,0,5,5,1,8

												30 minutes of gameplay, so this is a ''first impression'' review.I love it.If you're a big fan of pvp type games ranging from strategy to fps's etc, this is definatly worth a shot.In my experience this is the first game of its type(?)You board airships and man turrets, pilot the ship or run around repairing♥♥♥♥♥♥You can design your own ship, character and advance in the various ''classes.''As a first impression I give it a 9/10.;;EDITNow I have a few more hours below my belt, my recommendation hasn't changed.Honestly, this game has grown on me.This game redefines teamwork in this genre. If your ship has a weak team mate you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed.It's a lot about communication, talking to your captain/ engineers/ gunners.So prior to this game I would recommend getting a microphone if you don't already have one.Also, there is talk of a single player campaign/ missions, which is planned to be released some time in 2015.Although this is a fairly new game, I haven't come across any serious bugs or glitches.The UI in the main menu is a tad confusing at first but once you learn to navigate the game there are a lot of cool features to take part it.Bounties, hunters, clans, costumes, ships, etc.This game will continue to be a favorite of mine for a long time to come.10/10			",92,5,0,7,4,0,2

 Overview This can be one of the best co-op online games you've ever played. The mechanics are fairly simple and easy to learn (but often hard to master, as i will explain). The game is at it's best when you are on a ship with a competent crew which  communicates  (preferably with microphones). This is key to success because it allows proper teamwork. No single pro player can hope to carry a match without a good team. While this can make the game more engaging and thrilling, it also creates it's greatest weakness: being stuck with incompetant/silent/uncooperative player(s) that jeporadise the ship. There is really little you can do about this. If you can get past this seemingly unavoidable weakness, then the game can be a hell of alot of fun. There really is something awesome about blasting ships out of the sky or weaving in and out of combat or feeling like your manic wrench wacking is the only thing holding your ship together! With friends it's even better. you feel like your part of a well oiled killing machine!			",20,1,0,9,8,0,6

												An indie steampunk-themed strategy game with all the fun of guns, airships and teamwork. It cannot be stressed enough that this is a game where you work together as a team to keep the ship afloat and take down the enemy ship or capture the point.  There is a total of 3 roles which is the gunner, engineer and pilot with a total of 4 spots on each ship. Each class specialized in their role and every one of them has a stamina bar that is useful for the specific class which on default is on the Shift key. However, anyone can grab the helm to fly the ship, shoot the guns and fix the ship. So on any emergency like the captain disconnecting or engineer busy with fixing the balloon, the gunner can help steer the ship to safety and give the hull a tap.  It's extremely hard to care for a ship all alone however, especially when starting out so it's best to have 4 people on the ship to divide the work! Don't have any friends or any playing yet? No worries, the game will set you up with random players to work together and even if there is a chance a few of those spots weren't taken the AIs will help substitute those roles with the F1, F2 and F3 button to control them until the end of the match or till someone else decides to join the ship mid game.  The community is always friendly to new players as long as you're willing to listen and communicate. If you're confused don't be afraid to ask, there are community ambassadors who are specifically there to help along and many other players who will also give you advices and tips for the game.  It is highly recommended to finish the tutorial before you begin because even though it is a fairly easy game to pick up, you might not understand the tools which may frustrate not only you but other players in the middle of the match as well. There are multiple ships and guns to choose from so experiment around and accept recommendation unless you can explain why you declined it with the captain. Gunners are not the only class that can shoot guns so don't worry if the captain wants a crew with 3 engineers.  PS. There is voice chat and you may encounter a few drunk and/or high players for some oddly funny reason so have fun and be respectful of others no matter what.			",106,18,0,8,11,3,5

												Have you been looking around for a game to satisfy that certain craving? That craving for a really good, and well made co-op game? Where there is real strategy without it being a board game? Even with the customizability of an RPG? Well look around no more! For here lies the game that so many are searching for but have not found. Guns of Icarus is one of the most amazing online games I have ever played, and is definately worth the money to buy! But if you are like me, you want to know the pros and cons so here is a quick breakdown for ya! First off, the bad news...since it is the shortest part.=cons=-Pretty steep learning curve at first. But after a day of playing and reading a guide or 2 you kinda get the hang of it.-Semi-difficult interface. Some of the features are a bit confusing at first and may stump the average joe who is picking up the game. But again, this can be overcome by a day of playing and reading a guide.-""First game"" jeebies. Because this game is so dependant on a functioning team, when you first start off, it seems quite daunting and it feels as though every mishap is your fault. But don't worry. The game selection is fitted with a newbie section for ranks 1-3, so you aren't jumping into an expert match. And everyone generally remembers the fact that they had to deal with that as well and are quite understanding. In fact, for the most part, the community is very willing to help you find your ""sea legs""And wouldn't ya know it! That's the end of the cons! Now for the good stuff :)+pros+-One of the best multiplayer setups I have ever played!-Very simple, yet in depth strategy that makes the game so much more than just runnin and gunnin-Great community! Even though this community isn't as large as TF2 or whatnot, it is still large enough that you can always find a game, and is very helpful and kind to newbies-Amazing soundtrack! which for some people is no big deal, but my life is surprisingly centered around music, so it is a big plus in my book :)-Amazing graphics! For an online multiplayer game, that is under $20, it has very good graphics and is very visually appealing.-Personalization of both your character's loadout, and your ship's build-so good that I'm having a hard time remembering every single good thing about it because there are so many! :)Basically there are so many good things to this game for such small, and easily overcomeable cons, that it is not a gamble at all for whether or not you should buy it. I was quite hesitant at first, but now that I have bought it, I don't regret it! So if you like co-op, strategy, steampunk games that are rated 15 on an epic scale of 1-10, it is definately worth the money! :) Hope this has been helpful!			",50,8,0,21,3,0,3

												Do you like steampunk stuff? Have you ever dreamt of being in an airship and having epic sky battles? Have you ever wanted your very own airship? Then this game is for you!The community is great and helpful. The higher levels will teach you everything you need to know as long as you ask politely for it. Almost no lag unless you have like 300+ ping. 1 game lasts for around 20 minutes. If you want some action packed airship battles but you gotta go in 30 minutes, no problem.I highly recommend this game.			",18,6,0,2,0,0,2

												If you are looking for a competitive, passionate and polite team PvP game and you love all things steam-punk this might be the game for you. Team based airship battles with teams of two up to teams of four trying to apture control points or just blow the ever loving snot out of each other.Easy to pick up and learn, hard to master this game is worth it just or the social aspect alone. The developers keep[ in constant contact with the playerbase to improve the game whilst all the while working on the next two phases of the experience (Adventure mode and co-operative PvE.)A bargain by itself, certainly not to be missed during steam sales.*****			",94,4,3,15,33,7,25

												Guns of Icarus Online is the little game that could. Please ignore the Metacritic score; this game has been updated and tweaked and polished and fixed and balanced beyond belief. If you played the original Guns of Icarus (not online), it was, well, pretty terrible. But it was a good proof of concept; even if it was torturous to play, you KNEW it could be epic with just a bit more effort and funding! Enter Guns of Icarus Online: the best team-centered game I've played in years. Sure, Team Fortress 2 might have the word ""team"" in its name, but in TF2, a skilled player can just run rampant on the enemy and perhaps swing the balance of the game. In other words, teamwork is beneficial but not required. In Super Monday Night Combat, team work is so essential that having one n00b on your team tolls the death knell every single game. SMNC is unforgiving and frustrating in that respect, which is why I abandoned it. But then there's Guns of Icarus Online. GOI works differently. It strikes the perfect balance between individual skill and teamwork. Teamwork is ESSENTIAL for victory, but having a new player on your ship won't guarantee defeat. The key is communication between the crew and the captain and between the captain and his fellow captains. This is not a twitch shooter. This is a thinking man's game. You choose your ship, you choose your tools, you choose your ammo, and you make the best of a hectic situation when the bullets start flying. The GOI community is one of (if not) the most mature I've played with; new players are welcomed aboard if they're willing to be patient and learn the mechanics of the game. The game features a variety of flyable ships and different classes and ""class mods"" to keep those ships sailing and shooting. The variety is fairly expansive, but there's still room for additional content, which developers Muse frequently add, free of charge. In a word, GOI deserves your time, your respect, your kind words, and your money. I got the game on sale on Steam in the spring of 2012 and, after realizing what a gem I'd purchased, I kick-started their Adventure Mode campaign for twice the retail price of the game and purchased in-game items from the devs to customize my character. Give Guns of Icarus Online a chance and you will not regret it. Make a cocktail, swab the poop deck, avast ye mateys, load your ammunition of choice, give 'em a FULL BROADSIDE, and then once you achieve RAMMING SPEED make another cocktail.  There's bad dudes out there that need their steampunk-powered clocks cleaned, and your time has come. See you in the skies!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game requires coordination and teamwork. It fosters comradeship and requires leadership.Pilots also have to have a sense of direction and the common sense not to fly straight into the sodding sandstorm. Or crash into mountains/wrecked cities/obstacles.I love this game. It's fun, thrilling and does wonders for teambuilding with my community. The other players are friendly, helpful and fun to talk to, although you do sometimes get that bad egg who is quickly put in their place by others.I have happily pre-ordered Alliance, and I'm keen on seeing what comes next for Guns of Icarus and the Royal Alexandrian Fleet Air Service (AFAS).

												I recommend this game. Its a great game to play with friends. I do think you can enjoy this game alone though. Its a very team oriented game though, so be prepared to be cooperative. It consists of three main roles, The Captain, The Gunner, And The Engineer.The Captain is self explanatory, this is the person that is most likly going to be screaming commands at you through the build-in voice chat.The Gunner is your main offensive, they are the one's that man the guns most of the time. They mainly control the damage that is put out on the enemy.The Engineer is probably one of the most important roles, this is the person that makes sure the ship doesnt blow up. They are in charge of repairing anything and everything at once.I have a lot of fun with this game, and I think you could too.I give this game a 10/10<3			",56,16,0,9,4,1,4

												Great game to play with or without friends, teamwork and communication is a must, but the community is one if not the best ones i have ever seen.Its not repetitive because every ship, loadout and crew make for a completely new experience.All the people complaining about Alliance: It's a Standalone expansion for the game, think of it like World of Warcraft's legion or many other expansions, but this one is standalone.Without it theres already a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of content, and for a game taht costs 5$ it's more than enough.One of my best purchases			",83,5,3,8,6,1,4

												Devs started begging players to write positive reviews to attract new players (90% discounts don't do the trick, huh?) 3 years after the release. Here it is.+ Game concept sounds perfect in theory. Four man crew has to cooperate to control a large airship and shoot down other airships? Who wouldn't like+ Devs however swiftly get you back on the ground, when you realise a concept has to be followed by an actual good bunch of programmers and designers to make a good game+ Devs ensure you get to see quite a lot of memorable funny moments, when you see how far from reality they are. They are completely unable to see the state of the game and its community.+ The community is constantly so hyped about every fart that comes out of the devs you'll get on the hype train easily too+ You get to find a new bug almost every week+ Every bug you report will be promised to be fixed+ For every bug that actually gets fixed you get one bug for free+ Devs are ignoring the game to work on a DLC! YAY!+ Competitive playerbase is so small you get to know everybody personally within a week or two+ Noobs go away immediately after getting stomped by better players, so the player base keeps a healthy number of a couple hundred players+ During the time I've been active in the game and its community (more than a year) we got tons of new content. One map, one gun and quite a load of promises of better tomorrows+ You never knew what is achievement farming until you tried it in Guns of Icarus+ You might find new friends here (no joke here, sry)- It takes quite a while to realise you can take the friends you got here and go play better games together- The joke ""Blame Muse (devs)"" gets old quite fast, when you realise you can actually blame them for everythingSo... if you got here and still wonder if you should buy it, I say: Go ahead! It's probably on sale right now and the price of one rollercoaster ride won't kill you. It might as well entertain you for longer but that's a stretch probably :)			",186,40,5,14,20,1,34

												So I got this game. I played it once. I took a break and had food, good food mind you. Then I played it twice. Yet again I took a break. This time I slept. I slept for 9 hours. The alarm clock went off at 9AM but I turned it off. When I finally woke up at 9:04AM I had breakfast. It was a waffle. Some syrup was on it. I forgot to toast it though. The syrup was warm so it made up for it. By this time I was full. I stood up and pushed my chair in. Only enough so I could get up mind you. I washed the plate and my hands, with soap, mind you. It was lemon strawberry coconut soap, what will they think up next? luckily it was only 9:18Am now so I could still get to school before I was hungry again. I drove to school. Then I parked my car. I parked on the 3rd space from the left. Then I realized I forgot my pants. But it was ok because it was a dream. Then I woke up it was actually 9:05AM. Figuring I woudln't be able to make it too school before I was hungry I played the game a thrid time. Then I realized it was lunch. I had a taco. From Taco Bell. I had runs the next day. It ruined my toilet. I went to the doctor for my illness and I got a medicine for it. It tasted worse than baby vomit. baby vomit doesn't tast good. I then played the game a fourth time. This time I stopped and watched the TV. Nothing good was on it. Thats because I dusted though. Normally I have a really cool action figure of the pope on the top right corner. Channel 45 had a marathon of info-mercials which I quite enjoyed.			",61,8,0,2,3,0,5

												Not for the ""OH MA GAWD ITS MOVING SHEWT IT"" kind of people.And that’s a good thing! Because this beautiful game actually requires you to:-THINK-COMMUNITCATE-BE A TEAMSet in a jaw dropping steam-punk style world with plenty of ships, maps, and tools to make it not only authentic, but highly impressive for an air-ship combat environment.Pros:-RIDICULOUSLY easy to pick up and learn the roles/tools/ships/maps. This makes the learning curves simple when synergized with the achievement progress. Any class can do anything on the ship, but may access certain tools when doing their respective job. You have a: Pilot, gunner, and Engineer. All which are essential to every ship -Interesting idea. -Though very few customization, each thing proves it purpose accordnig to how you fly (assuming you’re a captain of the crew)This game needs time to invest. Games are decently long and offer a whole new experience to FPS. Aside from Steampunk themed-skybox sexiness, the core gameplay is without a doubt fun; No matter what class you play. The slow game play requires you to think, as mentioned before. This maybe a turn off to A LOT OF PEOPLE, considering many game industries are now aiming for ways to make gameplay faster. Cons:-The Achievement system is in a style that asks for repetition of certain things, yet get progressively more obscure later on as our progress. While it aids in learning the game, it maybe be difficult to pull off certain things along. Leaving people like me who’ve flown thousands of matches, seem a little behind.-Slow game play. That will be a major turn off. Though I look down upon it being a problem to begin with, it is what is, and I know most people will complain about it.-May be uninteresting and boring after a few days on it. The game doesn’t offer that much in terms of gameplay or items (though they will have content every once in a while like most games). Combining this with the speed of the game may make some people fall asleep.This game has a possibility to be extremely boring to many. There are also minor bug/glitches (which all games have), and this ultimately turns the game into a waste of your money; especially when combined with its slowness. That seems to be the only problem (aside from no one wanting to be pilot). Again, if you’re looking for in-action heart pounding games, this isn’t for you. Otherwise, I say get it  ",80,2,1,4,4,0,8

												A really charming and fantastic game for the cost. The concepts can take people some getting used to, but the game really does offer an experience that most games do not. It has all the downfalls that come with being a competitive game, but the benefits seem ten fold over MOBAs and FPSs in the sense that when you win there is a truly gratifying team experience almost every match. You feel like the captain of a ship, you feel the pressure of being an engineer as the ship begins to burn, and you feel satisfaction in well-timed and placed volleys made at the gunner position. It is one of the few games I've ever played where I didn't think the game was balanced to how people deal damage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What do you do with a drunken sailer, doin't bring him into an airship. Guns of Icarus is a game that is diffeent from the normal online games with guns. How it is different is because you are a guy in a ship, eather reparing, pioliting, or shooting the pot side guns. This game is havely set of team mates working together to win. I you doin't work as a team you will get shot down fast. The game has a nice steampunk feel to it,  It gives you the feel of ship Vs ship combat, without feeling tacky. It reminds me of a 1st/3rd person Online FTL game. And I love FLT. SO that is a good pluse, but my main gripe is that the online servers are just laggy for me. But that might just be my internet. Is the game good, yes, should you wait for a price drop, yes, is this game better with freinds, absolutly. It is not a must have, but it is a great game.P.S. Right is starborn, Left is port.

Some bad thing with game are that map versitlty is not great but and you can't spot freindly ships like emeny ship which have an on screen graphic, But this can all be sorted by updates by a very active Muse games! 8/10 would recommend this to anybody!!

												Great steampunk themed game that heavily focuses on teamplay. The basics are rather simple and easy to get into if you get someone to quickly explain to you all the important stuff, which is easy thanks to the friendly community GoIO has. (Second option is doing the tutorials which are frankly boring, but somewhat neccessary if option one fails.)Mastering the game is whole other story, that takes thousands and thousands of games. The simple things you learn at the start get more and more complicated. You'll need to improve your aim as a gunner, get the timing spot on as an engineer and finally tactically outwit enemies as a pilot.In the first few battles you probably won't have any idea what's going on - that's ok, get through it, it's worth it.The major flaw of this game is its small playerbase that continues to shrink every week. The lack of players means the game can often be unbalanced and therefore unfair to the newcomers who of course don't stick as a result of one sided matches.OUTDATED: Developers don't really help, they somewhat continue to ruin the game more and more with every patch. As they mostly ignore player feedback and base their nonsense balance decisions on statistics without actually playing the game. Their efforts to try to make the game more simple to lure in and retain new folk only lead to old ""veteran"" players to leave the game instead.EDIT: Developers finally started listening to player feedback bringing long needed community patches. The game seems to be heading into the right direction once again.It would be a great game with more players, now it's mostly just a painful experience.			",63,6,2,6,4,0,8

GOIO also offers some of the best community experiences of any game as well, with highly involved players, clans, and admins. Whether win or lose GOIO offers a fun and interesting experience that will only continue to grow as you play. I hope to see you in the skies.			",66,10,0,12,3,1,6

												Outstanding first-person game where you are either a pilot, gunner or engineer on a 4-person steampunk airship with various weapons (gatling guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and more).  You play in matches where a team of 2 ships fights another 2-ship team, or in larger 3v3 or 4v4 matches, set in beautiful 3D maps in various settings (arctic, desert, ruined urban landscape, canyons).There is a bit of a learning curve at first, becoming familiar with the various ship types, rangng from the speedy Squid (which I like to think of as a ""sports car with machine guns""), to the ponderous but powerful Galleon.  You also have to become familiar with the different repair tools, pilot tools, ammunition types and weapons.This is very much a game where teamwork and communication are key - the pilot has to position the ship to work with teammates to attack enemies, the gunners mainly shoot weapons, and the engineers keep the ship alive, while also firing weapons as needed.  If the crew (and team) does not work together smoothly, disaster is likely to be the result.I've played this game for over two years, at least several days per week, so you can tell I really like it, and recommend it to anyone interested in this genre.  Don't be discouraged at first when you go down in flames and your ship parts decorate the landscape, we all start somewhere :)The people in the community are generally very helpful to new players, especially if they have good attitudes about learning new things and listen to good advice (which is true of almost anything in life, really.)So come aboard and see what's going on!

												This is such a great game. It requires some thought, TONS of teamwork and communication. AND, it's really fun! I love the entire concept of air battleships. There are so many ways to outwit your enemies by hiding behind clouds, structures, at different altitudes, and using an ally as a bait.

												What do you do with a drunken sailer, doin't bring him into an airship. Guns of Icarus is a game that is diffeent from the normal online games with guns. How it is different is because you are a guy in a ship, eather reparing, pioliting, or shooting the pot side guns. This game is havely set of team mates working together to win. I you doin't work as a team you will get shot down fast. The game has a nice steampunk feel to it,  It gives you the feel of ship Vs ship combat, without feeling tacky. It reminds me of a 1st/3rd person Online FTL game. And I love FLT. SO that is a good pluse, but my main gripe is that the online servers are just laggy for me. But that might just be my internet. Is the game good, yes, should you wait for a price drop, yes, is this game better with freinds, absolutly. It is not a must have, but it is a great game.P.S. Right is starborn, Left is port.

												A really charming and fantastic game for the cost. The concepts can take people some getting used to, but the game really does offer an experience that most games do not. It has all the downfalls that come with being a competitive game, but the benefits seem ten fold over MOBAs and FPSs in the sense that when you win there is a truly gratifying team experience almost every match. You feel like the captain of a ship, you feel the pressure of being an engineer as the ship begins to burn, and you feel satisfaction in well-timed and placed volleys made at the gunner position. It is one of the few games I've ever played where I didn't think the game was balanced to how people deal damage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you play this by yourself it can get bad because of a bad team that you are in. so really you need you and your friends to play it togeather on one ship as a team, along with the other ships in your team, to succed at this game. Some bad thing with game are that map versitlty is not great but and you can't spot freindly ships like emeny ship which have an on screen graphic, But this can all be sorted by updates by a very active Muse games! 8/10 would recommend this to anybody!!

												I definitely recommend this game, though it definitely has a learning curve to it, and there are many ins and outs that are to be learned throughout playing, the community is pretty nice, I can't say everyone is perfectly nice, but there is a large portion which are ready and willing to help, and most are plenty willing to offer advice in lobbies and mid-game.Being a game with plenty of updates that happen every month or so, there are some changes to adjust to and re-balancing, but even when starting out if some things seem impossible to combat, there is usually a way to combat it, which is why it's always nice to ask around for advice and so on.Other than that, it is a really fun and enjoyable game, especially if you make some friends in the community or get some friends to join in with you, the graphics are amazing(so long you have a PC to power it), and great game mechanics. So try not to be to quickly defeated, and do know that plenty of players do take a bit of time to plan out ship and crew loadouts. Also a great part is that every ship, and class as well as tools are available without requiring DLC or microtransactions. Really the only microtransactions are costmetics(ship and character), which just adds to your ability to make yourself stand out if you wish. Certain cosmetics can be unlocked by leveling each class.I'll end to say, that with nearing 500 hours and 1200 matches, it's been great so far and going to continue to play.			",160,37,5,12,21,3,26

Flying is a bit strange to get used to at first, but it's really great fun, as are gunner and engineer. It's less than $4 now and definitely worth your time to check it out!			",110,6,0,7,8,0,6

												One of the most teamwork demanding games I have played, with a very active and involved developer team. Airship combat, from 2v2 to 4v4, 4 players per ship consisting of a mixture of pilots, gunners and engineers, attempting to work together within the ship itself and further teamwork with their allies ships as well. A Multitude of ship designs, guns, ammunitions and crew tools make it possible to play in a vast variety of manners and no two games are ever truly the same.The graphics aren't best in the buisness but they are still very nice to look at, views across the horizon are especially beautiful. With a steampunk setting there is a familiar aesthetic to it all, with plenty of cosmetic unlocks / purchases providing a variety of character options as well as some ship customization.As for the bad points, it's one biggest flaw sadly is that the playerbase is so small, as almost all of it's gameplay issues could be solved by simply having a larger pool of players to draw from. The two main complaints players seem to have is that games can take a while to begin (players join a lobby to assemble crews) and that the teams can often be rather uneven, both would be solveable if it had more players for the matchmaker to draw from. It's not it's only issue, but it's the only one that causes problems.The community at present is very small frequently meeting the same players, and as a result is very friendly, most of the veterans are more than willing to help teach newer players the ropes. For anyone wishing to start I would recommend doing so during a steam sale and/or weekend, as there will be more activity allowing for a novice-only match to fill up and less of a steep curve.Edit: A year later I've come back to play again, game is still fun as ever with a friendly community (mostly, you'll never get everyone), few more novices around. The only negative to say after this time is that the developers haven't really changed much in Skirmish due to their focus on upcoming PvE mode ""Alliance"".			",104,12,2,16,6,2,32

												I was once asked by a friend of mine to describe this game and what it was all about. I opened my mouth as my tongue started firing blanks. I had no idea how to describe this game. I thought for all of about a minute and then my mouth painstakingly howled, ""Pirates of the Sky!"" and then I fell over from my brain overworking itself. I can only imagine how this is going to turn out...Guns of Icarus: Online (henceforth to be called GoI:O for the rest of this review) is Multiplayer only, Team based, Matchmaking, Ship flying...*inhale*...damn thats a lot, created by a development team called MUSE and damn do they have something with this game. I found this game way back in the olden days of I believe March of 2013 when a youtuber by the name of Markiplier participated in a Polaris  organized match with several other youtubers and members of the development team. I remember wondering to myself, ""Why would a character of Greek Mythology need a firearm?"" Several reasons actually, but the point is that my jaw disconnected and hit the floor.The game takes place in a post-apocalyp-stick type world that for once didn't end in either the usual Nuclear blast, zombie attack or act of God. This world tore itself and new fecal defecator in a giant, global war that has divided the world into several large, powerful and very 1910s nations and has created new weapons of war; this including your valient war horses. In this game you fly ships. No, that isn't an oxymoron, you actually FLY. SHIPS! These ships are essentially the Black Pearl meets Hindenburg, but with more firepower and personality then Chuck Norris' beard. And each ship is drastically different in playstyle, armnament and design.On this subject of gamplay, the gameplay of GoI:O is like nothing I have ever played before, but for the sake of you I will divide my thoughts into the the three classes: Pilot, Engineer, and Gunner. Lets start with the easiest one, the Gunner. His or Her main job is to the fire the guns on the ship (No ♥♥♥♥♥e, Herr Sherlock!) and not much else. However, this roll is a highly specialized one in that the gunner needs to know how to fire EVERY guns there is, which is a Herculian task considering that each gun is different and travels differently in the world. Some weapons are really good and range while others just have too much of an arch to fire accurately or just explode in mid air.Speaking of explosions, lets talk about Engineers. If you like stressful work environments where your sole job is to run around like a Banshee repairing things like mad, this is for you! Okay, I'm being dramatic here, but the Engineer has what I believe to be the most important and difficult job. They are the all-arounders, constantly moving about the ship checking the various components of the ship and filling jobs as they come up with their wide assortment of tools. They will frequently be called upon to go on full repairs, fire weapons, spot enemy ships, and even take the helm depending on who you fly with. It is one of the most fun, difficult, and rewarding positions you can have in this game.Finally we come to my favorite position: Piloting. Flying these babys around in normal conditions is challenging enough depending on what map you play, but flying under fire takes some serious cajones, as the Latin peoples call it. As I said before, each ship has its own different playstyle so it is easy for up and coming Captains to find their fit or even prefer multiple ships over others (Pyramidion Master Race), so the creativity from all the different tactics for flying each ship and  tools to gain the advantage over your enemies through smoke screens, impact bumpers or even magical ""Take me up now"" fuel, really astounds me and manages to always make me wonder, ""How the hell did he do that?!""Not only does this game offer a straight up Team Deathmatch in 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 gamemodes in ship vs. ship combat, but it also has a very difficult game mode of capturing differnt territories on the map and collecting resources until you reach the max cap of points and win. Sadly, this is the only other gamemode, which really sucks because I'm sure Muse has some really awesome ideas in the pipe. However, the awesome beauty and detail of the maps that makes you feel like your on an epic journey kinda makes up for this. Plus there is going to be an MMO release of this game later in 2014, so hey, who am I to complain. A real♥♥♥♥♥ thats what I'd be.Probably the most commendable thing that Muse has done is the community they have created in this game. Without a doubt it is the best on Steam. There, I said. Go ahead and argue with me, but I haven't seen a single rude or idiotic person on this game until Pewdiepie attrached his fans to the game. Most of the community is very helpful and understanding to new players and even the developers remain active in the game, not just on forums, but actually playing the game with people and constantly asking what they could add or make better. They've even set up 'Community Ambassadors' that serve to keep the chat clean and game experience the best it can be. There are even several active clans that hold scheduled matches against eachother like you would see on a Starcraft twitch stream. *Ahem* go clan lol!All in all, this game is so fun and creative that I don't think I could ever write a proper review for it. My best suggestion would be to play the game for yourself and just let the excellence rain all over you. Or is that Moonshine?Anyways, Guns of Icarus: Online gets 8 mallets to the hull out of 10.

Guns of Icarus Online is a steampunk airship combat game. As a pilot, I choose and customise an airship (you get all the airships when you buy the game, no airship DLC nonsense) and either wait for a crew or invite some friends. There can be up to three crew members, and if nobody shows up then AIs do the job (badly, of course, since they're hard to communicate with).Crew members will be one of two chosen classes: gunner or engineer. Gunners man the guns, engineers repair - in theory. Anyone can man a gun, and engineers often will do so when nothing needs repairing.And now to what I actually think. It's a fun game, with great aesthetics - when I go to ram an airship (and I always end up ramming), I can see the crew of the other ship. They're so tiny. They look like little ants. I like ants. Have you ever seen a close-up picture of an ant? Yeah, ants are cool. Ant-Man had some pet ants, I think. He could shrink, too.*Ahem* Anyway. Your character is customiseable, though most stuff requires you to buy (or design!) items from the store. So either your crew or ships that are really really close will see it.There's a few issues, though - many people seem to be unable to refrain from naming their ship something ridiculous, like ""Yoda's Virginity"". I had to give orders to my crew like ""Quick, after The Yoda's Virginity!"" or ""Destroy Yoda's Virginity!"". I felt quite silly.Also, my ship is haunted. An AI keeps appearing and just charging right off the side and vanishing. It's a funny glitch.In conclusion, it's a steampunk game about airships and the airships explode with fireworks when they die. You should buy it if you like airships, but everyone likes airships, so you should probably buy it.			",16,4,0,11,6,0,6

												Recommendation for Guns of Icarus Online.PROS:-Game is easy to understand in the beginning.-Multiplayer is easy and mostly accessible to all players.-Character Progression is endorsed.-Easy to navigate UI for the player.CONS:-Clans have no reason to be used overall.-Character Progression is tideous sometimes to upgrade.-Sense of playing the same thing every game with no changes.Notes:-Playing Online with randoms is not as fun as playing with friends.-You may choose to level up 1 job, but then in-game not be able to be that job as it is already taken.-Clans are contradictory to the fact there is no easy way to do clanvsclan.Rating:8.2/10Overall:I would recommend Guns Of Icarus Online to players who have a lot of time to level up their character, has a lot of friends on frequently who own the game, and if you straight up like character progression and teamwork.

												Very fun game!The game has a first person perspective, and you play as either a pilot, engineer, or gunner. Pilots control the ship's three dimensional movement through a myriad of systems. They use lift to direct their movement up and down (w+s) and engines to turn left or right and to move forward, or backward. The speed of forward and backward movement can be controlled with the throttle (r+f). They have a choice of items that alters the ship's capabilities for a short period of time, usually at the damage of a relevant system. There are a lot of choices - moonshine in the engines for a quick boost; a chute vent to help you lose altitude quickly; tar barrels that make smog which damages ships that pass through it - and a good few more. It's the pilot's job to ensure the crew stays on task, in position, and alive.Engineers keep the ships running. The major systems of a ship - engines, balloon, weapons, and hull armor - can all be damaged during conflict. These systems will individually shut down to the detriment of the ship's crew. No engines means no movement, and  no balloon means you crash into the ground. No weapons means you can't defend yourself, and no hull armor means your ship's health will begin to take direct damage until either the armor is repaired or you disintegrate. Engineers can bring three repair items with them which repair the ship's components in different ways, but they can also bring ammo, so in those rare times when you're not getting shot you can adequately man a nearby gun. It's good to know which gun(s) on a ship you are likely to be using as an engineer and bring the complimentary ammo.Gunners are simplier, and some people would argue unnecessary. Gunners have the unique ability to bring three types of ammo, rather than the single slot restricted to the engineer. This means that there are certain situations where a gunner is helpful, but those times are honestly quite rare. However, I find it is common on the small to medium sized ships that three engineers are neither necessary nor overly helpful; conveniently, all but the largest of ships have most of their vital systems within a relatively small running distance. So with only two engineers necessary to keep the ship moving that means you'll likely have one crew member always on a gun anyway. Even when that person needs to jump off their gun to do emergency repairs, the only engineering item they would usually need is a spanner or a mallet. So while a gunner doesn't necessarily bring huge advantages to a group (I hope to see this change), I disagree with the notion that they bring any direct disadvantage to a crew.The game has seven ships currently, all with vastly different layouts, stats, and playstyles. From my time playing it all seems relatively ""balanced""; it's important to know what your ship is good at and play to those strengths. A Squid with its measly mass and three medium gun slots won't be able to stand toe-to-toe with a Galleon - a hulking double decker monstrosity with two large gun slots on either broadside - for very long. Solution? Use the Squid's astronomically higher speed and mobility to do strafe runs on the Galleon or stay behind it so that you only have its rear gun slot to worry about. All seven ships have such varied roles, and while some are surely favorited and some fallen into a more niche category, all command their own respect and strategy to compete with.There are microtransactions in the game, I believe I spent somewhere around $10 on this game during my time playing it. With that in-game currency I purchased an outfit for my character with paint and accessories for my ships. Since then I have not needed to purchase anything as there is nothing but cosmetic options in the store. I think the prices were relatively fair and I had no complications using steam wallet to purchase the currency.Overall I would rate this game a solid 8/10. If you can grab it on a 75% off sale, and you like the style of game, it would be silly not to get it. That being said, the game is much better if you can play it with friends. The game's interface is very accomidating to this; it has its own friends list, crew system, and matchmaking. Communication is vital in this game, and unfortunately I have heard whisperings that the public group community in this game is as bad as it is in every public grouped competitive game. But what makes friends better than a little gunship warfare? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTLDR; 8/10, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up on a gunship with your buddies			",102,8,0,15,15,1,18

												Fun game to play mith your m8's, but I would only reccomend picking this game up when it's on sale. Fun game but gets repetitve and boring after around 5 hours of gameplay, requires communication. Othrewise very unique, not 8/8 could be better.			",70,12,1,6,13,2,7

Guns of Icarus Online is a steampunk airship combat game. As a pilot, I choose and customise an airship (you get all the airships when you buy the game, no airship DLC nonsense) and either wait for a crew or invite some friends. There can be up to three crew members, and if nobody shows up then AIs do the job (badly, of course, since they're hard to communicate with).Crew members will be one of two chosen classes: gunner or engineer. Gunners man the guns, engineers repair - in theory. Anyone can man a gun, and engineers often will do so when nothing needs repairing.And now to what I actually think. It's a fun game, with great aesthetics - when I go to ram an airship (and I always end up ramming), I can see the crew of the other ship. They're so tiny. They look like little ants. I like ants. Have you ever seen a close-up picture of an ant? Yeah, ants are cool. Ant-Man had some pet ants, I think. He could shrink, too.*Ahem* Anyway. Your character is customiseable, though most stuff requires you to buy (or design!) items from the store. So either your crew or ships that are really really close will see it.There's a few issues, though - many people seem to be unable to refrain from naming their ship something ridiculous, like ""Yoda's Virginity"". I had to give orders to my crew like ""Quick, after The Yoda's Virginity!"" or ""Destroy Yoda's Virginity!"". I felt quite silly.Also, my ship is haunted. An AI keeps appearing and just charging right off the side and vanishing. It's a funny glitch.In conclusion, it's a steampunk game about airships and the airships explode with fireworks when they die. You should buy it if you like airships, but everyone likes airships, so you should probably buy it.			",16,4,0,11,6,0,6

												One of the most teamwork demanding games I have played, with a very active and involved developer team. Airship combat, from 2v2 to 4v4, 4 players per ship consisting of a mixture of pilots, gunners and engineers, attempting to work together within the ship itself and further teamwork with their allies ships as well. A Multitude of ship designs, guns, ammunitions and crew tools make it possible to play in a vast variety of manners and no two games are ever truly the same.The graphics aren't best in the buisness but they are still very nice to look at, views across the horizon are especially beautiful. With a steampunk setting there is a familiar aesthetic to it all, with plenty of cosmetic unlocks / purchases providing a variety of character options as well as some ship customization.As for the bad points, it's one biggest flaw sadly is that the playerbase is so small, as almost all of it's gameplay issues could be solved by simply having a larger pool of players to draw from. The two main complaints players seem to have is that games can take a while to begin (players join a lobby to assemble crews) and that the teams can often be rather uneven, both would be solveable if it had more players for the matchmaker to draw from. It's not it's only issue, but it's the only one that causes problems.The community at present is very small frequently meeting the same players, and as a result is very friendly, most of the veterans are more than willing to help teach newer players the ropes. For anyone wishing to start I would recommend doing so during a steam sale and/or weekend, as there will be more activity allowing for a novice-only match to fill up and less of a steep curve.Edit: A year later I've come back to play again, game is still fun as ever with a friendly community (mostly, you'll never get everyone), few more novices around. The only negative to say after this time is that the developers haven't really changed much in Skirmish due to their focus on upcoming PvE mode ""Alliance"".			",104,12,2,16,6,2,32

												I was once asked by a friend of mine to describe this game and what it was all about. I opened my mouth as my tongue started firing blanks. I had no idea how to describe this game. I thought for all of about a minute and then my mouth painstakingly howled, ""Pirates of the Sky!"" and then I fell over from my brain overworking itself. I can only imagine how this is going to turn out...Guns of Icarus: Online (henceforth to be called GoI:O for the rest of this review) is Multiplayer only, Team based, Matchmaking, Ship flying...*inhale*...damn thats a lot, created by a development team called MUSE and damn do they have something with this game. I found this game way back in the olden days of I believe March of 2013 when a youtuber by the name of Markiplier participated in a Polaris  organized match with several other youtubers and members of the development team. I remember wondering to myself, ""Why would a character of Greek Mythology need a firearm?"" Several reasons actually, but the point is that my jaw disconnected and hit the floor.The game takes place in a post-apocalyp-stick type world that for once didn't end in either the usual Nuclear blast, zombie attack or act of God. This world tore itself and new fecal defecator in a giant, global war that has divided the world into several large, powerful and very 1910s nations and has created new weapons of war; this including your valient war horses. In this game you fly ships. No, that isn't an oxymoron, you actually FLY. SHIPS! These ships are essentially the Black Pearl meets Hindenburg, but with more firepower and personality then Chuck Norris' beard. And each ship is drastically different in playstyle, armnament and design.On this subject of gamplay, the gameplay of GoI:O is like nothing I have ever played before, but for the sake of you I will divide my thoughts into the the three classes: Pilot, Engineer, and Gunner. Lets start with the easiest one, the Gunner. His or Her main job is to the fire the guns on the ship (No ♥♥♥♥♥e, Herr Sherlock!) and not much else. However, this roll is a highly specialized one in that the gunner needs to know how to fire EVERY guns there is, which is a Herculian task considering that each gun is different and travels differently in the world. Some weapons are really good and range while others just have too much of an arch to fire accurately or just explode in mid air.Speaking of explosions, lets talk about Engineers. If you like stressful work environments where your sole job is to run around like a Banshee repairing things like mad, this is for you! Okay, I'm being dramatic here, but the Engineer has what I believe to be the most important and difficult job. They are the all-arounders, constantly moving about the ship checking the various components of the ship and filling jobs as they come up with their wide assortment of tools. They will frequently be called upon to go on full repairs, fire weapons, spot enemy ships, and even take the helm depending on who you fly with. It is one of the most fun, difficult, and rewarding positions you can have in this game.Finally we come to my favorite position: Piloting. Flying these babys around in normal conditions is challenging enough depending on what map you play, but flying under fire takes some serious cajones, as the Latin peoples call it. As I said before, each ship has its own different playstyle so it is easy for up and coming Captains to find their fit or even prefer multiple ships over others (Pyramidion Master Race), so the creativity from all the different tactics for flying each ship and  tools to gain the advantage over your enemies through smoke screens, impact bumpers or even magical ""Take me up now"" fuel, really astounds me and manages to always make me wonder, ""How the hell did he do that?!""Not only does this game offer a straight up Team Deathmatch in 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 gamemodes in ship vs. ship combat, but it also has a very difficult game mode of capturing differnt territories on the map and collecting resources until you reach the max cap of points and win. Sadly, this is the only other gamemode, which really sucks because I'm sure Muse has some really awesome ideas in the pipe. However, the awesome beauty and detail of the maps that makes you feel like your on an epic journey kinda makes up for this. Plus there is going to be an MMO release of this game later in 2014, so hey, who am I to complain. A real♥♥♥♥♥ thats what I'd be.Probably the most commendable thing that Muse has done is the community they have created in this game. Without a doubt it is the best on Steam. There, I said. Go ahead and argue with me, but I haven't seen a single rude or idiotic person on this game until Pewdiepie attrached his fans to the game. Most of the community is very helpful and understanding to new players and even the developers remain active in the game, not just on forums, but actually playing the game with people and constantly asking what they could add or make better. They've even set up 'Community Ambassadors' that serve to keep the chat clean and game experience the best it can be. There are even several active clans that hold scheduled matches against eachother like you would see on a Starcraft twitch stream. *Ahem* go clan lol!All in all, this game is so fun and creative that I don't think I could ever write a proper review for it. My best suggestion would be to play the game for yourself and just let the excellence rain all over you. Or is that Moonshine?Anyways, Guns of Icarus: Online gets 8 mallets to the hull out of 10.

												While it is a little sparse nowadays, player-wise, Guns of Icarus is an excellent game where your motley crew of misfits (which may be in the form of your friends) go up into the skies in your sky boat, and shoot down other sky boats.There IS a lot more nuance to that simple statement. While attempting to kaboom other ships, your crew must repair your ship before it gets kaboomed. Engineers are the best at repair, while Gunners do the kabooming. Pilots, the third class, are the... well, the pilots of your sky boat, and also are normally the captain of the sky boat. Pilots get fancy things which can change how the ship flies, in exchange, when you use it, your engineer yells at you and your skyboat's engine or balloon takes some damage.This game is a great pickup, if you have friends to play with. Due to the sparce playerbase, I wouldn't advise buying this game for the solo play.Grab a few friends, take to the skies, and shoot down some sky boats, and laugh once everything goes horribly wrong.

												After already spending more than 100 hours with this indie treasure, I feel kinda guilty that I haven't yet took the time to write a review. I will do my best to not oversell this which is kinda hard as it's actually one of the most unique and fun games I've played yet.Guns of Icarus is a game with a pretty unique approach towards teamplay and a deep, tactical gameplay. As a member of a crew of 4 you will be trying your best to keep your airship in the air. You'll have to work together, coordinate and anticipate each other's next move to work efficiently and win a match. That's still just one aspect of what's required on the teamplay aspect. Communication is the key to form a good crew and it's rly fun to be part of that while calling out targets, celebrating shot down enemies and trying not to panic while being hunted by other crews. Each match features 2 teams consisting of 2 to 4 ships that fight for victory. So teamwork again is a big factor as the captains will have to coordinate their maneuvers and tactics.Once you learned the basic mechanics, you might realize that the winning teams are the one's with the better communication and teamwork. Lone wolfs don't get get anywhere in this game and often find themselves overwhelmed by efficient crews.  The game provides all the necessary tools and settings to help you play with the people you like and organize in crews, fleets and clans. And don't worry if none of your friends is currently playing the game. There are plenty of crews out there just waiting for new people to join them. If you are willing to communicate you'll easily find new friends.So get your microphone up and look for more experienced players to help you with the first steps :)  There are community embassadors that do just that: helping new people to start off and learn the ropes. But in general, large parts of the community are rly helpfull and polite.Regarding the future of the game: the developers are about to realease a new super sized expansion with a coop mode against ai controlled ships that will also offer a more progression orientated gameplay and lots of new content. If you are afraid they will do EA or SEGA-style rip-offs with mass produced dlc's, don't be. This is the first expansion of a game that has been around and developed for 3 years. The ingame store only sells cosmetic items, like ship decals or costumes, but even those can be unlocked by simply playing the game or joining one of the weekly events like ""fight the devs"" (they let the wining team pick something from the store afterwards). There is no Pay2Win here. In fact you get the full range of airships, weapons and tools just after proving yourself in novice matches with the other new players. If you are super impatient, you may just as well skip that part and start of right away with the full variety of options. There will be no veterans stomping you with stupid high level gear or premium guns like in Battlefield or CoD. Everyone has equal options in any given match. The only things that matter are teamwork, communication skills and experience.If you are not sure about purchasing, Just watch a let's play or two. You wil know pretty quickly if this is the kind of game you like. As someone who played this A LOT recently I'm just gonna end this review with...    See you up there in the skies!

												Guns of Icarus combines steampunk themes with airships and firepower. If you are a fan of shooting, flying or machines then you will likely enjoy this game. It's a lobby-based system where you can get into random crews for ships or make your own. Additionally, you can outfit your ships with different weapons which are then used by players are your ship. Everything takes place in first person, actually ON the ship (even driving, it takes skill).I highly reccomend getting this game especially if it's on sale. It's something that's best played in doses but even more than a year later I'm still coming back to it.			",189,41,4,62,24,0,85

												PROS- Focus on tactics over twitch reactions- High customisablity- Good community- FUN- High replayability- Graphics and Sound are well polishedCONS- Very addictive- Menu system needs better explanation for newbies, but not too difficult to get the hang ofTruth be told, this is easily one of the better Multiplayer offerings available on Steam !For a brief overview, this game is all about team planning and strategy. But where other games focus on twitch reactions and the like, Guns of Icarus is more of a deliberate slow burner. Every move you make is critical, but a quick trigger finger is less important than setting up where you are going next. Once you get in close and all hell breaks loose, it is rare to feel cheated in the event of destruction - it just means you have to regroup and try a new approach. Half the fun is in the endlessly replayable variance of trying to overcome different captains and their new tricks while maneuvering between the canyons, wrecks and sandstorms of the map.Even before you get into an actual match, there is a huge amount of customisation and planning you can undertake to provide subtle advantages (and disadvantages). Not only do the three classes (Pilot, Engineer, Gunner) each have special 'stamina' abilities dedicated to the left shift key which range from enhanced ship mobility, quicker reloading and faster in person sprinting, but they also have access to extra slots for their respective class items that dictate what they can do. Engineers can choose from various repair tools, Gunners from a variety of ammo types and Pilots can pick from a number of ship-based 'buff' abilities that can help maneuver in times of trouble. This, coupled with the large number of cool airships each with their own unique configurations of customisable weapon placements, gives the entire game an impressive level of tactical feel few others match. Do you go for the long range barrages of a Hwacha-armed Galleon, or hope to outmaneuver it with a zippy flamer-equipped Squid? The community itself is welcoming and pleasantly receptive to banter - I have had no trouble with anyone, and though not everyone has mics there is a comprehensive set of commands issuable via the 'V' key to cover almost all situations. If you DO get a team full of mics, though, then it turns into a joyful mad cacophany of communication as gunners call out targets out of arc and engineers shout out for help putting out engine fires while the Pilot converses with the other captains calling out battle plans.All in all, it is definitely worth the money whether you are just looking for a fresh multiplayer experience or you are after something deeper and far more unique than available elsewhere. The 4-pack is a steal, and even more so when it is on sale.Grab some friends and rule the high skies !			",131,31,1,10,13,0,40

A Powerful and Immersive Cooperative ExperienceImagine flying your very own Airship the way you want it. Imagine you and your friends cooperating together as a fully-functioning crew doing various tasks (controlling the helm, manning the guns, repairing engines, etc) working together as one to thwart the opposing crew, just like organs in a body working together to achieve an objective. Imagine your adrenaline rush when you are busy fixing the hull of your ship as the enemy closes in starboard side and no one is manning the gun and you enthusiastically called for help while the captain directs someone to repair the balloon due to losing altitude. Imagine working together with 2 other crew teams against 3 opposing teams (12v12) in the midst of a Sandstorm, imagine a game full of adrenaline, tactics and chaos.That game is Guns of Icarus Online.If there is any game that tests your cooperation, look no further. The graphics are deeply immersive with various maps and airships, coupled with amazing music that warrants you into the Steampunk Universe. You can choose among 3 roles (Captain, Engineer and Gunner), which gives you added advantage performing specific tasks. As the ship requires someone to steer, gunners to man the gun, engineers to fix ship components in the midst of a battle, everyone will have things to do at all times and you will have to do it in tandem with the other players.There are currently a total of 7 ships available to choose from (3 for Novice matches), and the fact that each ships has a different layout as well as stats really gives each one a very different feel and a very large-scale of depth for any team albeit anyone to master.My own experience was a blast as I played this game along with three other RL friends, we have switched various ships and realized how extensive this game was as each of these ships give a very different feel. We found one that works though, and performance really showed when we decided to use this ship. Overall we are playing non-novice matches regularly and each session are always packed with high amounts of adrenaline and gameplay depth.Negative pointsTo be fair, there are some quirks and negative points if you really want to pick and prod, here are some minor negative points that we pick up if you are really concerned:- Open information prior to match is open to abuse where dirty abusive players (or those who want to win no matter what) will customize their loadout to counter yours.- Player customization is very minimal, but perhaps this is due to their business model.- In-game description does not really match and is often misleading, to really understand each of the weapons/bullets/ships, it is critical to have a hands-on experience in each of them. Despite that, overall this game has totally blew our mind as it totally went above and beyond our expectationsTL/DRThis piece of gem has flown under my radar for so long and judging by the fact that none of my friends from various gaming communities has ever mentioned this game is simply ludicrous. This game is an absolute blast! If you have friends (4 as a team), please buy it already.			",588,322,17,77,71,4,87

												Guns of Icarus, a game-simulator of REPAIRTHEHULLYOUIDIOTS.Rather unique game with various game modes. As you start with the Novice level (levels before lvl 8 of any class) you are given simple ships to control (""Goldfish"", ""Pyramideon"" and ""Junker""). Every ship has their own unique pros or cons so it depends on what kind or ship you choose for your team. Each ship has around 3 engines, 1 hull and a balloon, as well as the guns. The hull is the most important part as it works like your armor which can be repaired. If this armor is down your ship takes damage, the ship damage can not be repaired.A team can be max up to 3 ships with their own crew. And the only way to contact the other crew in-game is either by having captains speak in their private voice chat or in the team text chat that entire team can see.It doesn't have next-gen graphics but all the locations and views are beautiful so I give it 8/10.There are 3 classes to play: Captain, Gunner and Engineer. All of the classes can do eachother's roles, but without being able to use ""Boost"" ability on things they are not meant to be doing (such as boost for the ship [captain], boost for reload speed [gunner] or boost for run speed [engineer]). Each class also has 1 item/perk that is used for either guns or the ship or for the repairing (depending on which class they do NOT belong to).There is only 1 captain in the crew. His main priority is to control the ship and use his perks to give it buffs for the cost of damage per second to engines or balloons, some for the cost of movement priorities.The gunner's task is to... well, wield guns. He has 3 perks that he can use, each of them has specific affection on the gun's priorities, such as attack speed, clip size, damage and projectile speed. He can also repair stuff but less efficiently (given he has only 1 tool that he can use for repairing)Engineer is the hero of your crew and possibly the second gunner if has good affiliations with the guns and his single perk that he has. If there were to be a comparison between a moba and Guns of Icarus, engineer is your support. Engineer wields 3 different tools. Each tool has their own priority for fixing and extinguishing fire. Engineer's tools are rather different from perks of Gunner and Captain. His tools either repair a big amount of health but have a big cooldown on repairing; have a good fire extinguishing power but low fire immunity time, and so forth. Playing engineer is rather hard, unless the Captain gives you good builds and orders for keeping your ship alive.Even though a crew can hold on well enough without an engineer by being able to fix their ship, they won't last long enough since it will distract the entire crew to fixing the ship.There is also a variety of different maps. There are big maps and medium maps. Big ones are only open to non-novice difficulty. The environment is also quite dangerous in these maps. There are sand storms and snow storms that will do bad things like damaging your ship when in it.Finally, there is customization. In order to not have your ships and characters look all the same you can modify their colors, skins, hats, clothes, ship's logo, ships colors, etc, etc. You unlock some while you can also buy the rest from the in-game store. Note, these do NOT give any perks or advantages for your team, only the cool looks.All in all, this game highly relies on crew communication and strategy of your captains.I don't think we would of ever seen a game like this, it makes communication the first priority in any crew.

												I was skeptical about this game after playing the old Unreal engine mod, but we've come a long way since then. It's easy to get your feet wet and enjoy yourself in a low-stress role with a mostly friendly community. But underneath lies a complex engine with an unexpectedly high skill ceiling involving trajectories, guns & ammo combinations, maneuvering, repair strategies, and coordination with your teammates over voice chat. It's easy to let your imagination run wild with all the other fun possibilities you'd like to see plugged into this framework. I'd love to see boarding parties, or massive juggernauts with huge crews, or a campaign mode. Typically when a player is analyzing a game and saying to themselves ""I wish it had ..."", it's a bad sign. But in this case it really isn't, because the foundation they've laid is already a boat load of fun.			",663,191,16,85,62,7,117

												This is generally fun game, but mediocre if you are playing on your own.It truly comes into it's own when you are playing with people you know and communicate with. If you have two groups of four, coordinated attacks with both ships are easier to do. They feel tactical, and challenging, but still fun. You feel as though you are an army flying through the sky attacking any enemies that cross your path.			",122,20,2,13,5,1,5

Product received for free
												Overall positive but I'll look at both sides.What does GoI Online do right?Great team mechanics - if you're looking for a LAN party game, something to play with a small group of friends online or if you just want to enjoy a team game where you have to work and communicate with other players, it's a perfect game for you. You seriously cannot win in this game without co-ordination between crew members, so it's perfect for that sort of dynamic.Relatively good graphics - the textures are nothing special in GoI, but a lot of the video effects used can give a great atmosphere. Not only that, but the entire design of the game is fantastic. Every ship and map has its own unique look and feel.Awesome sound design - There isn't a lot of music in the game, but where it does feature, it's great. Sound effects are also awesome. When battles get intense, you feel it, especially when you have good headphones.Great concept - the actual idea of GoI is awesome and unique, and something I'm surprised more companies and developers haven't tried to capitalise on. More games like it are springing up, but GoI is still a very unique and exclusive experience. There isn't a game quite like this anywhere elseNow, the downsides.Low population - probably GoI's most prominent flaw is its low player count. There simply aren't a lot of people playing this game compared to when it was first released, and that's especially bad when you've got a multiplayer game where players are far more valuable than AI. I've experienced instances where one lobby has left and disbanded, only for all of the same players to form up in a different lobby since nobody else is online. You'll see this happen a lot and it can be monotonous.Long grind - you do get levels, achievements and collectibles in this game, and gaining all of them can be brutal and long. Your levels are divided between three different classes, so you have to level all three to stay competitive, meaning you can't just focus one class and hope for the best. You will spend a lot of time in this game putting effort in and still getting little as a result other than the actual gameplay experience.Lack of depth - GoI has a solid framework, but behind that, there isn't that much. Little to no lore, no expansion on regions or ships, and also a very basic meta. Some guns counter some stuff, others counter other stuff. It's as simple as that 90% of the time. No combinations or workarounds like in other games like this. Get ready to pick a style and keep it, chances are everyone else is playing the same way. This is also an issue when you consider the price of this game. I was fortunate enough to receive this game as a gift, but I have friends who refuse to buy the game simply because some things (lore, story, gameplay depth) aren't there, and don't justify the price tag for them.Overall, GoI is a fantastic game, but it is lacking in features which I wish the developers would work on. And honestly, considering the lack of a large playerbase and the lack of effort being put towards the game by the devs, I wouldn't be surprised if this game goes F2P in the near future. Personally, I think it should, this game needs an influx of new players badly. Still, a fun game, and it definitely has features you may be looking for.7/10			",25,2,0,7,4,0,3

												It's absolutely amazing, the game feels like an RTS and it has every right too. It's 4 players per ship and it's ship v ship. Though the only downside that many players face. Is that you cannot board other ships. And it's hard to find a comptent crew sometimes. Though most the community is really helpful, and they are not afraid to show others how to work a certain part of the ship. And there is a lot of competetive play to it using the WANTED system. Where players can choose to become a WANTED person, and have to win matches to build a score. Doing so at the end of each period yields rewards. With that, I definately recommend this game to anyone that likes SteamPunk style games. And highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good game to play with friends.

												This is exclusively online and is definitely different than most games. You go on a flying ship with a crew of four. One drives the vessel and the other three shoots at other ships and repair yours. You’re two ships on each team (two teams). There is different objectives but the gameplay differ very slightly. It’s team deathmatch, king of the hill and hunter hunted. All of them is you and your crew-members keeping your fly-ship afloat and the enemies not so much.  The most fun is when you feel a good sync between crew members. That is why I recommend that you find three other friends to play with. I only played with one friend and two strangers and that does bring down the gameplay a lot for me. It’s vital that you have a oral way to bring information. Time and timing is of, as all 90:s commercials would say, EXTREME importance in this game (you should read out extreme in a cool voice). I do recommend the game but will warn you that it’s not so much wild action. The ships are slightly clumsy and a lot of gameplay is repairing rather than blasting. With friends this game is almost a must buy. Without friends you might want to double check your alternatives. PS: Works on LINUX!			",40,7,0,8,1,0,4

												Community is near non existant. Lack of content.  Gameplay is stiff.   Rather than being smart... they are adding paid DLC to seperate the few hundred who even play.    Rather than trying to revive the community with new content they are actually killing it by charging.     Let this game die and let another team of idiots know that the PAID DLC ERA NEEDS TO DIE.OH LOOK! THE FREE PERIOD IS OVER AND NOONE IS PLAYING THIS AGAIN! MAN GOOD THING THEY ADDED THAT WHOLE COMMUNITY SLICING DLC IN TO RAISE THE NUMBERS!I'm giving up hope on game devs/publishers.We understand you need money to keep the ships afloat... no pun intended... but nobody seems to wanna do it in a non-give us your money now for an update disguised as DLC way.

												sI enjoyed playing this game. Its fun to play with friends, have nice cartoon graphics and in manage for your team to win you need to fullfill your hole in your class and know about strategy and how the ammunition works. A skilled pilot is always necessary, but communication between the crew is the key.Worth getting this game even more if your can pay less in one of the Steam promotions.Disvantage: The only thing bugged me off is that sometimes there are major lag spikes, duo ping, and may happens in a vital momment when you are reparing the hull or the balloon. As I'm from Brazil this seems to happens a lot with me, but maybe for who is closer to the server and then have lower ping than me will not suffer from the same issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game!! :) I'll tell you why!         [8/10] > In my opinion chatting could be easier than it is at the moment![ABOUT THE GAME - Ships, jobs, controls]There are different kinds of ships with guns on them. You can choose one of these ships before every gamestart. Also there are 3 jobs you can choose from before every gamestart (Pilot, Engineer and Gunner). A gunner is specialised in arming the guns on your ship and has unique equips and special bullets to load the guns with. Find enemies and shoot them down! An engineer is specialised in keeping your ship healthy and he will be mostly jumping around the ship to fix broken guns and parts of the ship. Also he can buff guns (if he has that tool selected). I haven't played alot of engineer myself yet. Then there is the pilot and he is the one flying the ship into - or out of - battles. You can speed - or slow down - your ship (R/F), increase - or decrease - height (W/S) and turn left/right (A/D). Also he has boosts and other stuff. Every ship has a crew, existing out of 4 players. You can form your own crew. Are you looking for 1 pilot, 2 engineers and 1 gunner on your team? or do you want 2 gunners and only 1 engineer? [INGAME]Ingame you are walking over the ship you selected, which makes the game more realistic. You have to walk to the engines or balloon to fix them or walk to the gun on the left or right side if you want to mount it. You have to look around for enemies. They can come from below or from above. They can suddenly show up from a dusty cloud. You have to be careful that you don't enter sandstorms that will damage your ship. Also there are mountains or shipwrecks on the map you have to move around. You can also choose to fly into other ships, but that might hurt.. There are multiple chatrooms ingame (Chat to Crew [your own ship], Team [your ship + Allied ship], Match [Allies + Enemies] ) and voicechat is also possible. [MULTIPLAYER AND FRIENDS]It's a really nice game to play with your friends. We just turn on skype, form a crew and there we go! Name your ship as you want. You can make your own clan too in this game. Every crewmember has their own roles and together you will bring your ship to victory! If you like games that require teamwork -> Definitely give it a try![CONNECTION]I'm playing this game on my 4-year old laptop that is getting slower every day. In the beginning it was really laggy when i got ingame. Too little FPS to play the game in a decent way. I turned down the video-quality a bit and now i can play the game really well without laggs and i still have good video-quality (Nothing is blurry or colorless). It's a colorfull map and things are sharp. I can see clouds and sandstorms that are nearing me. It might be that you have a low FPS the first few seconds when you enter a game, but once i move to the deck it's gone. I guess the connection is different for every computer, but i just want to point out here that you don't need a really expensive or fast computer to play this game.Hope this recommendation helped you out! :Dxoxo -Vero			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus Review (Level 18, 68h) :+ Pros- Unique game in its genre. Play as a crew in a steampunk ship ! Be either the captain, the gunner, or one of the two engineers. - Graphics are very good, although a bit dated. The art direction is magnificient, it's a pleasure to fly through the different environment.- Combat is really well done, although you need to get some knowledge on how it works to fully understands it. Spend time to experiment etc.- Usually good community.- Good price for what it is- A freaking lot of achievements for those who want to grab them all !- The cash shop is purely cosmetical, and it allows to customise your character (a lot) and your ship (very little).- Negatives-You need friends and a voice communication to get a good experience. Playing alone or without voice com will make you bored, frustrated and angry.- Not much content. 5 ships, a good variety of weapons, but you're quickly going to get through everything. However mastering them takes skill and time, and of course a good crew.- PVP only so far, so brace yourself. Alliance DLC is coming soon though with PVE and more content.- Small but dedicated playerbase. You have to learn quickly or you'll get stomped by veterans.Overall : 9/10 with a full 4 player crew,  5/10 without. The game offers an unique and incredibly fun experience if you can get 3 of your friends on it. If not, then you'll quickly lose interest in it, as you can not put advanced strategies and likely get stomped in loop. The Alliance DLC might be a life changer though, as a PVE experience could bring a lot of new players and be quite enjoyable even withotu a full crew on vocals. We'll see !Final verdict : Excellent game, for casuals or pros alike, provided you have 3 or more friends with you. ",244,84,2,78,39,4,84

												One of the best of competitive multiplayer genre and at the same time most underrated game I know. If you're one of those types who always wanted to feel like, let's say, Admiral Horatio Nelson and sail their own ship (or fly, in this case), or command a fleet, THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR YOU. The gameplay promotes teamwork among the crewmates and the other pilots of your team. The team tactics are interesting aspect of the game. There are numerous ships, tools, weapons and ammunition, each useful in different kind of situations. The combat itself: Long-range, close-range, ramming, stomping etc. - all in three-dimensions and that's awesome. The most you can get out of this game is if you play with friends and form a crew or a fleet, but if your peers prefer different genres like mine, it's still a great game to play as pilot solo.Absolutely recommend!

												The concept of this game is great. You fly around and have airship dogfights, and you can use all your sailing terminology like you know what it all means!The tutorial went thru pretty quick, so I'd recommend taking the time to play them twice and review the controls.Matchmaking never takes more than a few minutes to find a match, and empty crew slots are filled with AI. From what I've seen, AI can be lacking and you'll wish you want a real player. Until you get matched with someone who doesn't know what's going on... then you'll want your AI back. If someone leaves, AI take their place which is a huge plus in these kind of games as you aren't left shorthanded.There is a bit of a learning curve, but leveling is slow which gives you the time to get on page with everything. Once you reach level 8 you are no longer restricted to novice matches.I have not yet reached level 8, so I have limited customization of ships and characters. But it seems you can modify anything from your ship guns down to your character's voice.Playing solo is not a hinderance, you can ingame text and voice chat to your crew, team, or captains. But if you have a group of friends who are looking for a game to play.. Look No Further!9.5/10			",108,15,2,38,16,3,20

												Probably one the best games that I have ever played. And I'm not putting that lightly.Pros:+ Decent graphics+ Cool idea+ Good class balance+ No pay to win (only cosmetics)+ Loads of teamwork involved+ Lots of awesome artwork/designs for ships and clothing+ Matchmaking is good+ Not too bad of a price+ Gets really intense and can leave you feeling like you actually were there, fighting alongside your friends+ Tutorial is easy and explanatory+ Tons and tons and tons of customization. Literally anything you could think ofCons:- Not well optimised. With my mid-high end custom-built desktop, I run at a solid 60fps until I get into a fight with explosions of any kind, which can sometimes drop my frames to a mere 20-30fps- Not all the ships are perfectly balanced. There aren't any ships that are overpowered, though some of the ships are never used simply because they aren't as balanced as the others- Leveling up doesn't have that many rewards- Not a lot of maps, though you rarely notice your surroundings unless you're a pilot or there's no fighting going onOther Ideas:~ If you are playing with a group of 4 friends, this game is, well, simply awesome. However, if you find yourself with any less than 4 of your friends, you can sometimes end up with a newbie crewmate~ The game doesn't REQUIRE a microphone, though it seems nearly pointless without one. Without the ability to communicate with your crew/party with live voice chat, trying to say things like ""THE BALLOON IS ON FIRE"" can only be said with the (somewhat hard to navigate) built-in voice chat (think TF2 voice commands)			",81,1,3,5,3,0,3

												Had this game for a while but never bothered actually playing an online game until just recently. That said, I'm not sure how this game used to fare back then but it seems to have come a long way. I would go as far as saying it's one of the better games that requires some actual team effort. With your crew depending on an able Captain and or Pilot to steer them in the right direction and vice versa to keep the ship flying and fight back whilst under enemy fire.Some may say the different roles by themselves lack a bit of depth but I think their straightforward playstyle makes it more approachable to newcomers, and I'm doubtful if making it any more complicated would better the game. Furthermore difficulty comes with the ship you'll be flying on which depends on your crew Captain's choice and is open to customization at his/her will as they can be armed with different weapons to specialize in long and/or short range, and each ship has different stats and difficulty in management.As with many games based on teamwork, voice communication is a plus but like I said; because of how direct the roles are, a crew with a bit of commons sense would fare just fine without or by using the in-game commands / text messaging. On contrary to popular belief, the AI isn't as bad as one would think.. people write them off so easily because they are unaware of the existence of orders which if given properly and timely, make the AI a formidable crew not to take lightly. This is however my experience and may be subject to change on higher levels / advanced ships though I highly doubt it unless there's some kind of pathfinding issues.The game has been on sale many times before and packs quite some value at that because in it's current state I do think it's worth the normal pricetag. If you like being part of a crew on an air ship and conquer the skies alongside others in a setting a la steampunk this game is as close as you can get. The feeling of seeing your ship and or crew unleashing hell on your foes and landing those hits is exhilarating to say the least.			",903,328,29,152,105,13,149

												The concept of this game is great. You fly around and have airship dogfights, and you can use all your sailing terminology like you know what it all means!The tutorial went thru pretty quick, so I'd recommend taking the time to play them twice and review the controls.Matchmaking never takes more than a few minutes to find a match, and empty crew slots are filled with AI. From what I've seen, AI can be lacking and you'll wish you want a real player. Until you get matched with someone who doesn't know what's going on... then you'll want your AI back. If someone leaves, AI take their place which is a huge plus in these kind of games as you aren't left shorthanded.There is a bit of a learning curve, but leveling is slow which gives you the time to get on page with everything. Once you reach level 8 you are no longer restricted to novice matches.I have not yet reached level 8, so I have limited customization of ships and characters. But it seems you can modify anything from your ship guns down to your character's voice.Playing solo is not a hinderance, you can ingame text and voice chat to your crew, team, or captains. But if you have a group of friends who are looking for a game to play.. Look No Further!9.5/10			",108,15,2,38,16,3,20

												Guns of Icarus Review (Level 18, 68h) :+ Pros- Unique game in its genre. Play as a crew in a steampunk ship ! Be either the captain, the gunner, or one of the two engineers. - Graphics are very good, although a bit dated. The art direction is magnificient, it's a pleasure to fly through the different environment.- Combat is really well done, although you need to get some knowledge on how it works to fully understands it. Spend time to experiment etc.- Usually good community.- Good price for what it is- A freaking lot of achievements for those who want to grab them all !- The cash shop is purely cosmetical, and it allows to customise your character (a lot) and your ship (very little).- Negatives-You need friends and a voice communication to get a good experience. Playing alone or without voice com will make you bored, frustrated and angry.- Not much content. 5 ships, a good variety of weapons, but you're quickly going to get through everything. However mastering them takes skill and time, and of course a good crew.- PVP only so far, so brace yourself. Alliance DLC is coming soon though with PVE and more content.- Small but dedicated playerbase. You have to learn quickly or you'll get stomped by veterans.Overall : 9/10 with a full 4 player crew,  5/10 without. The game offers an unique and incredibly fun experience if you can get 3 of your friends on it. If not, then you'll quickly lose interest in it, as you can not put advanced strategies and likely get stomped in loop. The Alliance DLC might be a life changer though, as a PVE experience could bring a lot of new players and be quite enjoyable even withotu a full crew on vocals. We'll see !Final verdict : Excellent game, for casuals or pros alike, provided you have 3 or more friends with you. ",244,84,2,78,39,4,84

Now imagine that there are guns on it, big guns. Now imagine that there is another balloon coming at you of equal proportions, shooting at you. This game is pretty damn awesome. I've never seen anything like it before and have a blast playing it. There are multiple classes: engineer, gunner, and pilot. Yes, I said pilot, you get to fly the behemoth, and trust me, it IS as cool as it sounds. Just get the game already, man!			",129,5,5,11,10,2,8

												An excellent twist on the classic team-on-team action, demanding skill and cooperation with both your shipmates and ships controlled by other players in several game modes. Unfortunately, there just isn't much here for solo players. This is very much a game where your enjoyment will be determined by who you play it with. The developers are very good, with frequent updates and tons of planned new content in the near future to keep the game continuously refreshing. It may not be perfect but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better ""gaming night"" game for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wouldn't consider this game an action oriented game by any means, it's a strategy game. Everyone starts off with the same equipment, but you can customize your ship or your character to match your crew(always work in a 4 man group). There is no such thing as going lone wolf in this game. Each ship has 4 people on it, one controls it/gives orders,  and the rest maintain the ship and shoot other ships, which can be good or bad thing depending on your teammates/captain. There are three roles you get on this game: Engineer- Your main focus is repair, you are what keeps the ship going. Most of this play style is based on time management and focus; the difficulty of this class is based on the ship you're on. Sometimes you'll have an easy time maintaining the ship  and shooting guns when you have the chance, othertimes your focus will fully be on repairs. Since engineers are the ones who get around the ship the most, it's also handy to keep an eye out for enemy ships coming from the captain's blindspotsGunner- uses the guns, but mostly manages the rounds in that gun.The rounds you pick before the match begins are important, they decide the effect the gun has on your gun/enemy ship. Sometimes with this class you might need to make an emergency repair, but most of the time you're maintaining your gun and firing on the enemy ship. Each gun also affects different parts of the enemy ship in different ways, so play around until you understand what gun works best on what you're aiming at.Captain- As a captain, you organize your ship and your crew before the match begins, and then pilot the ship in game. You're the person in charge on your ship, and you work together with the other captain to decide how to attack or defend against the enemy ship. Communication as a captain is very important, along with strategy and picking your fights. A good knowledge of how the guns work and how your ship gets repaired can help in deciding what you can do with that ship.I would recommend this game if you like strategy and teamwork over brute force. The community is a close knit one where everyone knows everyone else practically, and is very open to helping new players along, so feel free to ask questions to higher level players or hop on ships and ask what they want you to bring/do. Just be patient, and have fun with it.  ",103,7,4,4,3,0,4

												This is a game about teamwork, communication, and tactical thinking. Between the interactions between crew members to keep a ship moving smoothly, the interactions between captains to coordinate attacks, and the spatial considerations in maneuvering in a 3D air environment to avoid taking hits while positioning yourself to dish out damage, this games offers some of the best gameplay available to take a group of people and forge them into a friendly fighting unit.Whether you have a group of friends looking to play together, or you are joining alone, if you are willing to open to fellow players, Guns of Icarus offers a unique opportunity to bond with local and distant gamers over the common goal of keeping an airship in the air.I highly recommend trying this game. If you find you enjoy the gameplay, I encourage you to look towards the forums and the clans. The depth of the strategy of the game is staggering even with the limited number of ship styles and guns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game heavily emphasizes teamwork.  In the beginning levels of the game, with the straighforward deathmatch game mode, you can easily learn the ropes of the game.  The leveling system doesn't give anyone an advantage. Levels show that you know what you are doing and give people an idea of your overall skill level.  The game also isn't pay to win.  What you can pay for is cosmetic enhancements. Overall, GoIO has given me several hours of fun gameplay with my friends.  If you like co-op games based on team skill, then definitely buy this game. The devs put alot of effort into this game.  They even play and give free rewards if you can beat them.  They are still improving this game.  Even now, there groundworks for an adventure mode, based on the wreckages you can see in the battle maps that suggest a cataclysmic war of some kind.Edit:Adventure Mode!!!			",104,3,0,6,3,1,2

Only downsides are slightly imbalanced Pyramidions, above average system reqs and a small playerbase.Go get it people, it's well worth the money.			",24,3,0,1,0,0,1

												I have played Guns of Icarus for 16 hours at the time of writing, but I know all that I need to to write this review, and hopefully help any new players thinking of getting the game themselves. First and last, there is an almost necessary yet unspoken social contract in guns of Icarus which you are almost required to follow.First: you must make an effort to learn the game. If you think that Guns can be played like any lone-wolf solo game, you will be ostracized until you get serious. Observe what others do, and follow suit until you get it, so that you drag others down as little as possible. There's a lot you won't get at first.Second: the captain can be contested, but follow his orders anyways. Captains can be (and often are) wrong, but they usually know the most about game flow. Respect their decisions, but don't be afraid to say that they are incorrect if you have a good reason.Third: know the crew before you try and captain. If you haven't played gunner or engineer for at least three rounds each, don't bother being a captain. You probably don't know enough to be good at it yet, that's just a fact.Fourth: your class roles are important, but not set in stone. Gunners have an extra repair tool, and engineers have an extra ammo type for a reason. Just beacuse you are one class doesn't mean you can't play as another (just that you probably shouldn't).Fifth and final: be a sportsman. Respect your enemies, and respect your allies. If you aren't willing to do your best, don't bother. It really shows when someone doesn't care, and everyone can see it.If you can do all those things, Guns will gladly let you into the ranks of its own. The pros will be able to help you and answer your questions, and in a few short hours of these you'll be pretty good too. Guns is daunting at first, but it's simple once you get it. Keep trying your best, and you'll be great at it in almost no time.			",140,21,1,14,30,0,26

												I used to play alot of singleplayer games and things like co-op with some friends, later on i started multiplayer, with COD and stuff like that. now i found a game thats uniqe and very good at its way to turn things around. the goal of the game is to shoot other airships from your own airship. you cant get off the boat, there is an pilot engineer and a gunner. as a team you must take down the enemy's and win the game!Guns Of Icarus, a uniqe multiplayer experience with up to 6 ships in one battle and 24 players in one match.soon there will come more gamemodes, but the gamemodes that are in the game already are awesome.8/10.-overall a good multiplayer experience-friendly people online-variety of guns you can place on ships-just lovely :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ths game was such a good surprise! I started playing this game with friends not really knowing what to expect, and it turned out to be something like the best co-op game we've played!Basically, 4 players on a flying ship: 1 pilot, the 3 others are gunners or mechanics. You must destroy enemy ships, whilst taking the least damage possible, or you'll explode yourself (this is why mechanics are important).There's a general steampunk look to the game that is quite well done.As I said, cooperation is really important, and when I was playing with friends, we really did have the feeling that we were winning - or loosing - as a team. This can be problematic if you play with randomly selected people on the internet, because communication on online game doesn't always work perfectly!			",14,2,0,3,2,0,6

												This game heavily emphasizes teamwork.  In the beginning levels of the game, with the straighforward deathmatch game mode, you can easily learn the ropes of the game.  The leveling system doesn't give anyone an advantage. Levels show that you know what you are doing and give people an idea of your overall skill level.  The game also isn't pay to win.  What you can pay for is cosmetic enhancements. Overall, GoIO has given me several hours of fun gameplay with my friends.  If you like co-op games based on team skill, then definitely buy this game. The devs put alot of effort into this game.  They even play and give free rewards if you can beat them.  They are still improving this game.  Even now, there groundworks for an adventure mode, based on the wreckages you can see in the battle maps that suggest a cataclysmic war of some kind.Edit:Adventure Mode!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GoIO is a multiplayer game like no other. As you should know by the time you are reading this review, that the point of the game is to act as crew member in a airship and destroy the enemy ship(s). While the game is simple in concept, there are as many tactics and strategies for this game as there are players. However, winning in this game always boils down to two simple things: teamwork and communications. Teamwork wins - every time.Positive:+ Easy to learn, hard to master.+ No cheaters & great community.+ Even losing can be fun.+ Teamwork is important. This is surprisingly and refreshingly different from other MP gamesNegative:- Look at the points on the positive side. This is not the game for impatient result driven loners.			",38,15,1,12,16,1,18

												This is a game about teamwork, communication, and tactical thinking. Between the interactions between crew members to keep a ship moving smoothly, the interactions between captains to coordinate attacks, and the spatial considerations in maneuvering in a 3D air environment to avoid taking hits while positioning yourself to dish out damage, this games offers some of the best gameplay available to take a group of people and forge them into a friendly fighting unit.Whether you have a group of friends looking to play together, or you are joining alone, if you are willing to open to fellow players, Guns of Icarus offers a unique opportunity to bond with local and distant gamers over the common goal of keeping an airship in the air.I highly recommend trying this game. If you find you enjoy the gameplay, I encourage you to look towards the forums and the clans. The depth of the strategy of the game is staggering even with the limited number of ship styles and guns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game!! :) I'll tell you why!         [8/10] > In my opinion chatting could be easier than it is at the moment![ABOUT THE GAME - Ships, jobs, controls]There are different kinds of ships with guns on them. You can choose one of these ships before every gamestart. Also there are 3 jobs you can choose from before every gamestart (Pilot, Engineer and Gunner). A gunner is specialised in arming the guns on your ship and has unique equips and special bullets to load the guns with. Find enemies and shoot them down! An engineer is specialised in keeping your ship healthy and he will be mostly jumping around the ship to fix broken guns and parts of the ship. Also he can buff guns (if he has that tool selected). I haven't played alot of engineer myself yet. Then there is the pilot and he is the one flying the ship into - or out of - battles. You can speed - or slow down - your ship (R/F), increase - or decrease - height (W/S) and turn left/right (A/D). Also he has boosts and other stuff. Every ship has a crew, existing out of 4 players. You can form your own crew. Are you looking for 1 pilot, 2 engineers and 1 gunner on your team? or do you want 2 gunners and only 1 engineer? [INGAME]Ingame you are walking over the ship you selected, which makes the game more realistic. You have to walk to the engines or balloon to fix them or walk to the gun on the left or right side if you want to mount it. You have to look around for enemies. They can come from below or from above. They can suddenly show up from a dusty cloud. You have to be careful that you don't enter sandstorms that will damage your ship. Also there are mountains or shipwrecks on the map you have to move around. You can also choose to fly into other ships, but that might hurt.. There are multiple chatrooms ingame (Chat to Crew [your own ship], Team [your ship + Allied ship], Match [Allies + Enemies] ) and voicechat is also possible. [MULTIPLAYER AND FRIENDS]It's a really nice game to play with your friends. We just turn on skype, form a crew and there we go! Name your ship as you want. You can make your own clan too in this game. Every crewmember has their own roles and together you will bring your ship to victory! If you like games that require teamwork -> Definitely give it a try![CONNECTION]I'm playing this game on my 4-year old laptop that is getting slower every day. In the beginning it was really laggy when i got ingame. Too little FPS to play the game in a decent way. I turned down the video-quality a bit and now i can play the game really well without laggs and i still have good video-quality (Nothing is blurry or colorless). It's a colorfull map and things are sharp. I can see clouds and sandstorms that are nearing me. It might be that you have a low FPS the first few seconds when you enter a game, but once i move to the deck it's gone. I guess the connection is different for every computer, but i just want to point out here that you don't need a really expensive or fast computer to play this game.Hope this recommendation helped you out! :Dxoxo -Vero			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game in my honest opinion. Great variety unlock-able customizations for your character and ship. It is a little grindy if your not an achievement go getter but it is a great experience. The A.I. system is also one of the best I have seen as well. They follow commands on key and do only what is necessary. I notice a lot of thinking is required for this, after all it is a strategy game. All 3 categories has to have some sort of plan whether your engineer or gunner and especially the captain. All in all, great game. Loved it and totally recommend it.			",55,4,0,3,7,0,6

												Guns of Icarus, a game my friend had assured me wasn't hard an was fun; he was definitely half right, as it was fun, yet my first match saw my ship go down with barely a single kill. Luckily i adapted, albeit slowly...One key thing i realised is team work is necessary, when playing with a friend, not only is it more fun but is it easier to manage a tag team esque battle. Things i like about the game:     +Beautiful Music and landscapes (they really are!)     +Great ship weapon and decoration customisation     +Interesting levels of comunication beneficially, but not completely necessary if without a mic.     +Lovely character skins/customisation     +Amazing array of ship weapons to rend the foes ship into dust.     +Not being a pay to win game.Things i didn't like:-Having to pay for minor things like decorations.10/10 aitships destroyed.

												Guns of Icarus is a perfect combination of teamwork and strategy as you try to outmanuvre your opponents and blow them out of the sky. Graphics are amazing. It is just a pretty game in general. Teamcomps are a bit stale as the Gunner class brings less to the crew than running 3 engineers and the pilot together. But then it is currently in beta at the time of posting so we will see what they implement here.However there is a large variety of perks for the classes, such as the lucky foot which increases the turn angle of your ship, as well as different weapon loadouts for the many ships available to use. These include things like mines and flamthrowers amongst the cannon and rocket like guns you would expect. This game is fun to play and even more fun if you can get a team of four friends to communicate with. alothough you have a voice chat option in game it is alot more difficult communicating to random players than to your friends over a service like mumble or skype. Overall the game deserves a much higher rating than the one it has been given and i hope to sink many hours into it as they bring out things like the adventure mode building up to the full release.

												THE SHORT REVIEW:A fun co-operative game to enjoy with friends, highly recomend the four pack if you do decide to pick this game up.THE LONG REVIEW:This game is quite literally co-operative, you will need to have someone doing their jobs or you and your teammates are screwed. Why did I recomend the four pack? It's best to play GoI with people you know or at least people who will put the co-op in co-operation cause if you don't then it will be difficult to coordinate different strategies. Not working together will and can get you killed, and not actually following through with the role of your class will warrant the same result.Guns of Icarus is a neat little game that caught me by suprise because I wasn't expecting it to, well, be fun at all. However the odd matches where friends weren't available to play the game got kind of boring, and it is definetly one of those games where you should atleast have people you know working with you (even though there is a chatbox and such).MADE FOR: Fans of Steampunk and Flying Ships. It's also made for those who actually have a group to play and communicate with.NOT MADE FOR: People that dislike games that run on Unity, and of course the whole setting of Steampunk. It's also worth noting that the game really isn't good if you have no one you know to play it with.GUNS OF ICARUS 7.5/10			",355,40,1,35,23,1,24

												I really like this game!! :) I'll tell you why!         [8/10] > In my opinion chatting could be easier than it is at the moment![ABOUT THE GAME - Ships, jobs, controls]There are different kinds of ships with guns on them. You can choose one of these ships before every gamestart. Also there are 3 jobs you can choose from before every gamestart (Pilot, Engineer and Gunner). A gunner is specialised in arming the guns on your ship and has unique equips and special bullets to load the guns with. Find enemies and shoot them down! An engineer is specialised in keeping your ship healthy and he will be mostly jumping around the ship to fix broken guns and parts of the ship. Also he can buff guns (if he has that tool selected). I haven't played alot of engineer myself yet. Then there is the pilot and he is the one flying the ship into - or out of - battles. You can speed - or slow down - your ship (R/F), increase - or decrease - height (W/S) and turn left/right (A/D). Also he has boosts and other stuff. Every ship has a crew, existing out of 4 players. You can form your own crew. Are you looking for 1 pilot, 2 engineers and 1 gunner on your team? or do you want 2 gunners and only 1 engineer? [INGAME]Ingame you are walking over the ship you selected, which makes the game more realistic. You have to walk to the engines or balloon to fix them or walk to the gun on the left or right side if you want to mount it. You have to look around for enemies. They can come from below or from above. They can suddenly show up from a dusty cloud. You have to be careful that you don't enter sandstorms that will damage your ship. Also there are mountains or shipwrecks on the map you have to move around. You can also choose to fly into other ships, but that might hurt.. There are multiple chatrooms ingame (Chat to Crew [your own ship], Team [your ship + Allied ship], Match [Allies + Enemies] ) and voicechat is also possible. [MULTIPLAYER AND FRIENDS]It's a really nice game to play with your friends. We just turn on skype, form a crew and there we go! Name your ship as you want. You can make your own clan too in this game. Every crewmember has their own roles and together you will bring your ship to victory! If you like games that require teamwork -> Definitely give it a try![CONNECTION]I'm playing this game on my 4-year old laptop that is getting slower every day. In the beginning it was really laggy when i got ingame. Too little FPS to play the game in a decent way. I turned down the video-quality a bit and now i can play the game really well without laggs and i still have good video-quality (Nothing is blurry or colorless). It's a colorfull map and things are sharp. I can see clouds and sandstorms that are nearing me. It might be that you have a low FPS the first few seconds when you enter a game, but once i move to the deck it's gone. I guess the connection is different for every computer, but i just want to point out here that you don't need a really expensive or fast computer to play this game.Hope this recommendation helped you out! :Dxoxo -Vero			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't quite get why everyone is hating on this game recently.  I'm aware that I haven't played as long as the veterans (obviously), but its not a bad game.First of all: The lobbies are not bad. They do take a bit longer than some games, but not as long as it takes to connect to GTA V Online...Second of all: The player count is lower, but you can still get a full team.  Third of all: Why do people care if the devs pay attention to the community or not? If there is a bug in the game, surely they will notice it and fix it.  And they are at least trying to revitalize the game with the DLC. Why would they release a DLC to a couple hundred players just for money?  They wouldn't, it's there to get more new players into the game.And to be fair, the game is quite fun. As the crew, you have to communicate with the Captian to be able to do what you must, and as Captain you must listen to your crew as well as pilot the ship independently.  And for $11.99, it is a very good game.			",26,5,2,2,13,0,6

												Amazing game in my honest opinion. Great variety unlock-able customizations for your character and ship. It is a little grindy if your not an achievement go getter but it is a great experience. The A.I. system is also one of the best I have seen as well. They follow commands on key and do only what is necessary. I notice a lot of thinking is required for this, after all it is a strategy game. All 3 categories has to have some sort of plan whether your engineer or gunner and especially the captain. All in all, great game. Loved it and totally recommend it.			",55,4,0,3,7,0,6

												Great Action Multiplayer game that will be addicted since the first try.Unique, interesting and well balanced multiplayer gameplay bring the best out of this game.In particular, most of the player is supportive and friendly with other player.That makes every players feel participated and enjoy this game together.Even a new foreigner player like me, which English is not native language, be able to participate and get full support from another senior player. This makes me very impressed because not all game have good players like this, especially local online game in my coutry which a lot of player does not care about the others and just play for win, even that mean cheating or using unfair method.

												Ths game was such a good surprise! I started playing this game with friends not really knowing what to expect, and it turned out to be something like the best co-op game we've played!Basically, 4 players on a flying ship: 1 pilot, the 3 others are gunners or mechanics. You must destroy enemy ships, whilst taking the least damage possible, or you'll explode yourself (this is why mechanics are important).There's a general steampunk look to the game that is quite well done.As I said, cooperation is really important, and when I was playing with friends, we really did have the feeling that we were winning - or loosing - as a team. This can be problematic if you play with randomly selected people on the internet, because communication on online game doesn't always work perfectly!			",14,2,0,3,2,0,6

Looking for co-op?Guns of Icarus is a unique game with an interesting concept. Our group purchased a 4-pack on sale and got a good night of gaming out of it. There is no ""campaign"" or story versus the AI. You'll be playing as a team - competitively against other teams. The game queue times aren't always short, but the individual matches last long enough to make the wait worthwhile. Even the least competitive players in our group of 4 were able to have fun with it. I would still wait for a sale before purchasing it though.			",58,18,0,11,4,0,12

												I wouldn't consider this game an action oriented game by any means, it's a strategy game. Everyone starts off with the same equipment, but you can customize your ship or your character to match your crew(always work in a 4 man group). There is no such thing as going lone wolf in this game. Each ship has 4 people on it, one controls it/gives orders,  and the rest maintain the ship and shoot other ships, which can be good or bad thing depending on your teammates/captain. There are three roles you get on this game: Engineer- Your main focus is repair, you are what keeps the ship going. Most of this play style is based on time management and focus; the difficulty of this class is based on the ship you're on. Sometimes you'll have an easy time maintaining the ship  and shooting guns when you have the chance, othertimes your focus will fully be on repairs. Since engineers are the ones who get around the ship the most, it's also handy to keep an eye out for enemy ships coming from the captain's blindspotsGunner- uses the guns, but mostly manages the rounds in that gun.The rounds you pick before the match begins are important, they decide the effect the gun has on your gun/enemy ship. Sometimes with this class you might need to make an emergency repair, but most of the time you're maintaining your gun and firing on the enemy ship. Each gun also affects different parts of the enemy ship in different ways, so play around until you understand what gun works best on what you're aiming at.Captain- As a captain, you organize your ship and your crew before the match begins, and then pilot the ship in game. You're the person in charge on your ship, and you work together with the other captain to decide how to attack or defend against the enemy ship. Communication as a captain is very important, along with strategy and picking your fights. A good knowledge of how the guns work and how your ship gets repaired can help in deciding what you can do with that ship.I would recommend this game if you like strategy and teamwork over brute force. The community is a close knit one where everyone knows everyone else practically, and is very open to helping new players along, so feel free to ask questions to higher level players or hop on ships and ask what they want you to bring/do. Just be patient, and have fun with it.  ",103,7,4,4,3,0,4

												Guns Of Icarus has so much potential but all you do is whack a piece of metal with a wrench while the only fun thing i guess is being a pilot but if it was more immersive i would 100% recommend this game if it was thrilling but still a good try, it's good to play with friends and have a laugh and extinguish friendships when somebody did not repair the hull or not go left with the ship while that one AI is d**king around repairing things that are already repaired at a slow pace to ruin your match, get good or you will never win or if you have a very experienced team to do the work for you i would give this game an overall rating of 6/10 have fun playing.

												Had this game for a while but never bothered actually playing an online game until just recently. That said, I'm not sure how this game used to fare back then but it seems to have come a long way. I would go as far as saying it's one of the better games that requires some actual team effort. With your crew depending on an able Captain and or Pilot to steer them in the right direction and vice versa to keep the ship flying and fight back whilst under enemy fire.Some may say the different roles by themselves lack a bit of depth but I think their straightforward playstyle makes it more approachable to newcomers, and I'm doubtful if making it any more complicated would better the game. Furthermore difficulty comes with the ship you'll be flying on which depends on your crew Captain's choice and is open to customization at his/her will as they can be armed with different weapons to specialize in long and/or short range, and each ship has different stats and difficulty in management.As with many games based on teamwork, voice communication is a plus but like I said; because of how direct the roles are, a crew with a bit of commons sense would fare just fine without or by using the in-game commands / text messaging. On contrary to popular belief, the AI isn't as bad as one would think.. people write them off so easily because they are unaware of the existence of orders which if given properly and timely, make the AI a formidable crew not to take lightly. This is however my experience and may be subject to change on higher levels / advanced ships though I highly doubt it unless there's some kind of pathfinding issues.The game has been on sale many times before and packs quite some value at that because in it's current state I do think it's worth the normal pricetag. If you like being part of a crew on an air ship and conquer the skies alongside others in a setting a la steampunk this game is as close as you can get. The feeling of seeing your ship and or crew unleashing hell on your foes and landing those hits is exhilarating to say the least.			",903,328,29,152,105,13,149

Not that many people play this game but you will be able to play many matches but sometimes you have to wait a few minutes.If you like:-Steampunk theme-Airships-Teamwork-""Capture the point"" and ""Deathmatch"" gamemods-Dont need to buy DLC or anything like that to be able to play the gameYou should buy this game.If you dont wanna play alone buy the 4-Pack on sale and give the game to your friends and form a great crew together.

												One of the best of competitive multiplayer genre and at the same time most underrated game I know. If you're one of those types who always wanted to feel like, let's say, Admiral Horatio Nelson and sail their own ship (or fly, in this case), or command a fleet, THIS GAME WAS MADE FOR YOU. The gameplay promotes teamwork among the crewmates and the other pilots of your team. The team tactics are interesting aspect of the game. There are numerous ships, tools, weapons and ammunition, each useful in different kind of situations. The combat itself: Long-range, close-range, ramming, stomping etc. - all in three-dimensions and that's awesome. The most you can get out of this game is if you play with friends and form a crew or a fleet, but if your peers prefer different genres like mine, it's still a great game to play as pilot solo.Absolutely recommend!

												It's a great game to play and at the perfect price. If you enjoy steampunk ships battling it out in a beautiful open world then you will enjoy this. You work together in a team of up to 4 ships with a crew of 4 per ship. The classes are Gunners, Engineers, and the captain which is of course Navigator. Teamwork is a must in this game as you work together to give the ship life and flight. The devs of the game are nice, helpful, and can also been seen often in the chat when not busy working to improve the game or listenning to feeback. The community has also been very good and you will rarely ever find a troll in my experience. I can also safely say the game is not pay 2 win due to the fact the cashsop is only cosmetics. All you need to do is pick a role or even swap roles, pick a ship and the parts you like, or pick your ammo and head out to earn your fame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seriously defines the meaning of ""Co-operative Gameplay""! Loads of fun, best played with mates but even the solo queue is heaps of fun. Community is pretty positive too.Popular enough to get games going, but will get more popular once the new DLC comes out (Which looks amazing, if you've played Guns of Icarus before).

												sI enjoyed playing this game. Its fun to play with friends, have nice cartoon graphics and in manage for your team to win you need to fullfill your hole in your class and know about strategy and how the ammunition works. A skilled pilot is always necessary, but communication between the crew is the key.Worth getting this game even more if your can pay less in one of the Steam promotions.Disvantage: The only thing bugged me off is that sometimes there are major lag spikes, duo ping, and may happens in a vital momment when you are reparing the hull or the balloon. As I'm from Brazil this seems to happens a lot with me, but maybe for who is closer to the server and then have lower ping than me will not suffer from the same issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THE SHORT REVIEW:A fun co-operative game to enjoy with friends, highly recomend the four pack if you do decide to pick this game up.THE LONG REVIEW:This game is quite literally co-operative, you will need to have someone doing their jobs or you and your teammates are screwed. Why did I recomend the four pack? It's best to play GoI with people you know or at least people who will put the co-op in co-operation cause if you don't then it will be difficult to coordinate different strategies. Not working together will and can get you killed, and not actually following through with the role of your class will warrant the same result.Guns of Icarus is a neat little game that caught me by suprise because I wasn't expecting it to, well, be fun at all. However the odd matches where friends weren't available to play the game got kind of boring, and it is definetly one of those games where you should atleast have people you know working with you (even though there is a chatbox and such).MADE FOR: Fans of Steampunk and Flying Ships. It's also made for those who actually have a group to play and communicate with.NOT MADE FOR: People that dislike games that run on Unity, and of course the whole setting of Steampunk. It's also worth noting that the game really isn't good if you have no one you know to play it with.GUNS OF ICARUS 7.5/10			",355,40,1,35,23,1,24

												Guns of Icarus, a game my friend had assured me wasn't hard an was fun; he was definitely half right, as it was fun, yet my first match saw my ship go down with barely a single kill. Luckily i adapted, albeit slowly...One key thing i realised is team work is necessary, when playing with a friend, not only is it more fun but is it easier to manage a tag team esque battle. Things i like about the game:     +Beautiful Music and landscapes (they really are!)     +Great ship weapon and decoration customisation     +Interesting levels of comunication beneficially, but not completely necessary if without a mic.     +Lovely character skins/customisation     +Amazing array of ship weapons to rend the foes ship into dust.     +Not being a pay to win game.Things i didn't like:-Having to pay for minor things like decorations.10/10 aitships destroyed.

												Guns of Icarus is a perfect combination of teamwork and strategy as you try to outmanuvre your opponents and blow them out of the sky. Graphics are amazing. It is just a pretty game in general. Teamcomps are a bit stale as the Gunner class brings less to the crew than running 3 engineers and the pilot together. But then it is currently in beta at the time of posting so we will see what they implement here.However there is a large variety of perks for the classes, such as the lucky foot which increases the turn angle of your ship, as well as different weapon loadouts for the many ships available to use. These include things like mines and flamthrowers amongst the cannon and rocket like guns you would expect. This game is fun to play and even more fun if you can get a team of four friends to communicate with. alothough you have a voice chat option in game it is alot more difficult communicating to random players than to your friends over a service like mumble or skype. Overall the game deserves a much higher rating than the one it has been given and i hope to sink many hours into it as they bring out things like the adventure mode building up to the full release.

												Very, very fun. GREAT community, haven't heard anyone rip on eachother, and everyone is very friendly. The teamwork in this game is really what makes it so great. Very smooth, interesing steampunk airship battling will ensue upon purchase. Easy to learn, fun to master. Immersive maps, dynamic clouds & weather, and overall feeling of gameplay is very good. You will probably encounter lag occasionally, but most games (at least for me) have been very smooth with no issues. Not graphically demanding so pretty much anyone can play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun and engrossing action/strategy.  Airship battles set in a steampunk atmosphere.  Everything relies on your team working together which is made up of specialized members, ie unique classes/equipment loadouts which can be customized.  There is absolutely no ""rambo'ing"" in the game.  There are no individual stats displayed at the end of each round, although they are tracked so you can review them yourself, and do contribute to your character leveling up.  Leveling your character confers no in-game bonus, but does serve as an indicator of how much experience you have playing the game.  However, a team of veterans who do not pull together with their ship can easily be out-maneuvered and overpowered by a team of noobs who are actually working together, albeit even without a great understanding of how the game works.  This is accomplished by built in voice support which automatically moves you to channels for the game lobby and your ship, once the action starts.  The captains of the ships can also use a separate channel to plan strategy amongst themselves before handing out orders to their crew.  That's what makes it such an interesting dynamic.  The ships are competing, not the individuals.  The crews are completing, not the individuals that make them up.  It is also nice to play a game where the devs and mods play often and are available for questions.  They've even added a couple new maps since I started playing a few weeks ago.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10Where to start. To get my ""opinion"" out of the way, this is the greatest game I have ever played. Now that that is settled, to the game itself.I'm sure that you've read various other reviews telling you that the game is very team oriented. I cannot stress this enough, and let me tell you why. Since this is an FPS game, there is NO 3rd PERSON MODE. Not even as the pilot. This forces the crew members to cooperate with eachother in a way that I have never experienced before, and it is something to behold. Communication and cooperation are key, whether the balloon and engines need repair, the gunner is slightly out of range, a sandstorm is approaching from behind, or an enemy ship is right above you, everyone has to be ready to communicate.""But thats impossible! No gaming community is cooperative, or friendly, enough to offer that kind of experience."" Let me tell you that again and again the community that composes this game is not only the most friendly, but the most helpful that I have ever encountered. As a newcomer I knew this game like the back of my hand in no time, thanks to the help of some random players I met in game lobbies. The lobbies are full of fun times and cool people from all over, and everyone wants everyone to have a good game experience.Last, but cetainly not least, the gameplay. Flying these ginormous clunky ships is something you won't find anywhere else. It is a unique experience that requires a bit of skill and teamwork, but theres something so incredibly addicting and charming about it that just makes you want more. Your ship is stacked with customizable guns for different purposes, long range, medium range, short range, armor piercing, balloon damage, explosive damage, and tons more. There is always something to ready for, parts to repair and buff, guns to extiguish and load with the appropriate ammo, and enemies and hazards to be spotted. There are also environmental hazards, such as terrain to doge, weave, and hide around and sandstorms that sneak out out of nowhere.To put the gameplay in perspective, think of this: Your ship is charging out of a cloud at the unprotected side of an enemy ship. Gunners man the front guns and open fire while the captain rushes in for a ram. Your ship hits theirs and glances off to the right, while their ship spins around and is facing your right side. The situation is now a scramble, gunners running to the right side guns of the ship and trying not to fall off in the process, mechanic repairing damage to the hull from the ram, and the captain trying to get the ship out of the enemy's range of fire. The enemy ship is now facing guns forward at yours and starts pounding away with a mortars and a flamethrower, disabling your side guns and deflating your balloon. Your ship is slowly falling, the captain has decided to retreat and the whole crew is focused of keeping the hull in repair and the balloon inflated. Despite the crew's efforts, the hull's armor is down and the ship is now taking direct damage. Lucky for you, your ally ship bursts from the cloud in front of you and totally saves the day, finishig off the enemy and giving you time to repair. This is just a little taste of the exitement and thrill of this game.When I found this game, it was because I was looking for a cool steampunk game to play. This game has all the steampunk charm you could hope for, in the ships, in the setting, and in the customizable characters. As a steampunk fan, I can honestly say that this game completey satisfies my need for steampunk stuff. I love this game, I love this community, and I highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants to experience something new.			",91,11,2,12,6,1,2

												if you like steampunk zepplines and fierce battles in the open skys using guns missles and everything in between then this game should be bought now. if you need more convincing this game is UNIQUE I mean it does things differntly and it does them well. you do everything from a first person perspective including fly the ship which makes the strategy of the game more apperent each ship ahs blind spots for both the pilot and the guns so you can sneak up on people or just slug it out you have to work with people in your crew. their is a lot of customization from your loadout to your ships guns. generaly the game is great the community is nice the batles are intense each person from the newest player to the oldest veteran have a job and the downtime fixing your ship just intensifys the action. finaly te ships are all well designed to add to the fun of play and they arent invincible by any means but they dont die easily you can survive most opening barrages and if you hide fix yourself up to fight again.  now of course this game isnt perfect the ships guns have really odd places they cant hit and the spotting is a bit finicky but this isnt gamebraking by any means i am realy just nitpicking and these problems get less and less each update.  if your still not convinced jsut find a freind who has it and play a few rounds with each class you will love it.

												You play as a space pirate named steve in a far off galaxy, who wouldn't want that!? Also it's best played by yourself becasue your teamates are useless. You are the heart and and soul of your vessel! It's you against the world! P.S. Junker is the best ship and the javelin rope cannon works really well. P.P.S if you do end up with teammates that can actually play make sure you're all gunners, cause every other class is useless. 9/11 would bang! ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10Where to start. To get my ""opinion"" out of the way, this is the greatest game I have ever played. Now that that is settled, to the game itself.I'm sure that you've read various other reviews telling you that the game is very team oriented. I cannot stress this enough, and let me tell you why. Since this is an FPS game, there is NO 3rd PERSON MODE. Not even as the pilot. This forces the crew members to cooperate with eachother in a way that I have never experienced before, and it is something to behold. Communication and cooperation are key, whether the balloon and engines need repair, the gunner is slightly out of range, a sandstorm is approaching from behind, or an enemy ship is right above you, everyone has to be ready to communicate.""But thats impossible! No gaming community is cooperative, or friendly, enough to offer that kind of experience."" Let me tell you that again and again the community that composes this game is not only the most friendly, but the most helpful that I have ever encountered. As a newcomer I knew this game like the back of my hand in no time, thanks to the help of some random players I met in game lobbies. The lobbies are full of fun times and cool people from all over, and everyone wants everyone to have a good game experience.Last, but cetainly not least, the gameplay. Flying these ginormous clunky ships is something you won't find anywhere else. It is a unique experience that requires a bit of skill and teamwork, but theres something so incredibly addicting and charming about it that just makes you want more. Your ship is stacked with customizable guns for different purposes, long range, medium range, short range, armor piercing, balloon damage, explosive damage, and tons more. There is always something to ready for, parts to repair and buff, guns to extiguish and load with the appropriate ammo, and enemies and hazards to be spotted. There are also environmental hazards, such as terrain to doge, weave, and hide around and sandstorms that sneak out out of nowhere.To put the gameplay in perspective, think of this: Your ship is charging out of a cloud at the unprotected side of an enemy ship. Gunners man the front guns and open fire while the captain rushes in for a ram. Your ship hits theirs and glances off to the right, while their ship spins around and is facing your right side. The situation is now a scramble, gunners running to the right side guns of the ship and trying not to fall off in the process, mechanic repairing damage to the hull from the ram, and the captain trying to get the ship out of the enemy's range of fire. The enemy ship is now facing guns forward at yours and starts pounding away with a mortars and a flamethrower, disabling your side guns and deflating your balloon. Your ship is slowly falling, the captain has decided to retreat and the whole crew is focused of keeping the hull in repair and the balloon inflated. Despite the crew's efforts, the hull's armor is down and the ship is now taking direct damage. Lucky for you, your ally ship bursts from the cloud in front of you and totally saves the day, finishig off the enemy and giving you time to repair. This is just a little taste of the exitement and thrill of this game.When I found this game, it was because I was looking for a cool steampunk game to play. This game has all the steampunk charm you could hope for, in the ships, in the setting, and in the customizable characters. As a steampunk fan, I can honestly say that this game completey satisfies my need for steampunk stuff. I love this game, I love this community, and I highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants to experience something new.			",91,11,2,12,6,1,2

												Guns of Icarus Online lets you slip into an intense battle on airships with explosions, chaos and drama. In a team of four, your goal is to wreck the enemie's ships while trying to stay above ground. The right ship with the fitting set of guns with a working crew is essential for victory.You can choose between three roles:♦Pilots are steering the ship and use a set of items to help them navigate. A very stressful role, because it's up to the pilot if the ship should engage the enemy, stay aside to the team or flee from battle. Therefor the pilot is mostly the captain who leads the crew and keeps them working as a unit. If you like to be a leader, this is your position!♦Engineers can rarely sit down and calmly drink a beer, as their job is to keep the ship together. With their set of tools they can rebuild, repair and even buff compoments of the ship. Whenever there's fire to extinguish, the engineer's here to save your head. Be the one who everyone should be thankful to that they are still alive!♦Gunners take their set of different ammunitions to the guns and choose the right kind to deal the most possible damage. Gunning is not to be underestimated because it does take skill to let a bullet hit the target when the pilot's driving like a drunken sailor. You are the one to burn enemies down with the flamethrower or rip their balloon into pieces with the canon!Communication is crucial in Guns of Icarus Online. For instance: The captain tells the gunner to man certain guns because he is about to position the ship in a certain way and engineers should focus on the engines because the captain burns them down with kerosine to gain speed. A microphone and the willing to talk are never wrong, but if you don't have one of the two things, you can use macros to share information, which is on my experiences enough. Text is also possible, but should be used carefully because it is likely that suddenly an enemy's firing at you while you are slamming keys on your keyboard.Because this game is filled with stressful situations and wrong decisions it's possible that crewmembers get frustrated and start to talk in a sharp way, but mostly the community keeps a cool head and tell you in a calm way what should be done and what should be avoided. If you are new in this game, there are novice gamelobbies where you play with people with about the same experience and most people are friendly enough to explain certain elements and rules. Ragequitters are marked with a low 'Match Completition Rate"" and when a crewmember does leave the game, another player replaces the position pretty soon. In my whole playtime I 'only' had one griefer who surrendered immediately on the first death and blocked the gameplay instead of leaving the game, and in such cases you can report player for their behaviour fast and easy after the match.Different types of ships, a good selection of weapons and interesting maps are what makes this game enjoyable, but what's truly great is that every match is different. Every captain has their own strategy, situations change from a promised defeat to a glorious victory and there are hardly any boring pauses after the start of a match. It is incredible fun when you play this game with three other friends together and work out plans and maneuvers.Guns of Icarus Online is simply great!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you ever wanted to be on a ship and repair it AND steer it AND shoot from it AND jump off of it AND kill other ships? Well, lil ♥♥♥♥♥, look no further. This game is on a whole new level of wavy. You should buy this for you, your friends and your family members for the experience of a ghetto block party. Don't buy it for no thots tho. Now, if you don't like this game then your role model growing up was most likely a mixture of Gold Dust the wrestler and Solange Knowles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PLAY THIS WITH FRIENDS. I REPEAT- PLAY THIS WITH FRIENDS!Seriously, it would make your play experience much, MUCH better! Trust. Why? Well I'll tell you why. I'm just going to say that there are so many dang players that don't know what they are doing, engineers in gunner roles and vice-versa, captains going out of control for no apparant reason, etc. You know you are pretty much screwed when one of your guys can't distinguish between a shifting spanner and a rubber mallet.On the other hand, when you have a group of friends or out of pure luck- get people that knows how to play this game properly, this is where the game really shines out of all other indie games. The teamwork-based actions in trying to successfully take down your opponent's flagships is probably one of the best I've seen in any type of game that requires team effort. Sticking together with your other team mates is vital in winning your match.Only con I can think of is- why can't you die when you fall out of your airship? Pfft, yea I mean team effort, but it would be awesome with a bit of comical relief and realism added in on the side of the batch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An incredibly fun game when you've got decent teammates. It's even fun when you lose, that's how good this game makes you feel. The mechanics feel solid (except for when you've got a really high ping, but my internet sucks here, so what can I say?), and there are multiple chances for customization as you level up in the game. My only problems are when that 1 guy out of 100 decides to be a total d-bag to everybody, and the fact that the upcoming DLC isn't free. In fact, it's more expensive than the game itself. It would be alright, I guess, if they treated it like a second game so you didn't have to purchase this one to get it, but alas, it would seem not to be so. At any rate, the game right now is incredible to behold, and the team play and epic sky battles are something else you'll most likely never see anywhere else.			",49,5,0,6,2,0,0

												Really fun good game when you play with the right people. What you do is fly airships and maintain your airship on your airship you have mounted turrets which you can change from flame throwers to mortars you havve to blow up ships theres different game modes too! But things you need in this game is 1. communication is very important I joined a game with people who don't speak english they were russian and our ship got blowned up a whole lot because lack of communication. 2. Its best to play with friends. 3. when worst comes to worst at least listen to your team mates if you don't have a mic and try being an engineer or gunner deaf captain is a dead captain. Have patience when you get more experience because this game is on sale and new people join and are really bad,one guy who was captain jumped of the ship when it was on fire and didn't steer out of smoke(smoke is bad never go in it) Overall this game is extremly cheap and really fun and its like $8 for limited edition 4 pack play with your friends! guns of icarus 8.8/10( some bugs and some bad times but you will learn to love this game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game heavily emphasizes teamwork.  In the beginning levels of the game, with the straighforward deathmatch game mode, you can easily learn the ropes of the game.  The leveling system doesn't give anyone an advantage. Levels show that you know what you are doing and give people an idea of your overall skill level.  The game also isn't pay to win.  What you can pay for is cosmetic enhancements. Overall, GoIO has given me several hours of fun gameplay with my friends.  If you like co-op games based on team skill, then definitely buy this game. The devs put alot of effort into this game.  They even play and give free rewards if you can beat them.  They are still improving this game.  Even now, there groundworks for an adventure mode, based on the wreckages you can see in the battle maps that suggest a cataclysmic war of some kind.Edit:Adventure Mode!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only game in which you and three other players are literally stuck in the same boat.You can't jump in a match and do ... whatever. That doesn't fly here. This game at a base level requires some degree of coordination. But bring a modicum of sense and attention (and the ability to communicate either through text chat or microphone), and the community will more than happily bring you up to speed.Some say Guns of Icarus is best played by buying a 4-pack and grabbing three buddies to play with you. That may be, but I wouldn't know, as I almost exclusively joined random matches for my first 800 matches, and had a complete blast doing so.The game hasn't had any major updates lately, but what's there right now keeps me coming back again and again. Also, keep an eye out for the Alliance PvE DLC.Another issue would be a relatively low (but stable) population. It seems to settle around 200 players during a weekday evening a couple months after the most recent sale. Check SteamCharts for more info. However, as the player population is mostly concentrated in the Americas and Europe, there might only be some 40 players or so when you decide to give GoI a spin 4AM in the morning. But you'll still be able to find a match, thanks to the existence of AI crewman! That is, as long as you're fine with flying the ship while everyone else on your ship is an AI.Point is, don't worry about never getting into matches.On sale or not, Guns of Icarus is quite the steal if it turns out to be your cup of tea. I highly advise those on the fence to watch some Youtube Lets Plays of the game. They'll give you a pretty good idea of what you'll be flying into.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus Online is a splendid cooperative game which provides an experience you cannot get elsewhere. It rewards thought and coordination in a ship to ship steampunk package, challenging you to rule the skies!At the most basic level, you have two teams comprised of two to four ships, facing off against one another in a variety of modes. There are several unique ships to select, and each ship can be customized with different weapons based on their mounts/slots. Each crew consists of four people, who individually can select one of three classes, and then select class gear which they will use on the ship. This provides for a surprising amount of variability before you factor in player action in the game itself. You have to communicate and plan ahead, then adapt to the circumstances which emerge. As an individual, you are both essential to and dependent upon your crew. If you Pilot, you need someone else at Gunner to take your shots, and an Engineer to keep you flying. They in turn depend on you to approach, evade, and keep their weapons in arc or range. Even as a Captain of one ship, you need to coordinate with the other ship(s) to achieve your aims. You do not need a microphone - there are voice clips and text chat - but you need to speak and to listen, you all fly together, or you will be dashed apart.There is a very high skill ceiling which rewards both experimentation and analysis. Players start out with basic notions about roles, then uncover the details of a task (learning about main vs. secondary engineering, and the merits of different fire control tools), then find some tactical awareness (tacking to the side against this ship using this tool will allow us to hit their blind spot), and finally emerge into the strategic plane. Players keep learning and each learning leads to more exciting gambits and outcomes, which is why people can play this for thousands of hours.The community is close-knit and peculiar, with a strong core of pleasantly eccentric and capable veterans. If you have friends, you can take a ship with them, and if you don't, you'll probably make some in Guns of Icarus over the first weeks of play. You can also find rivalries, form or join clans, and generally have a splendid social time.In summary, if you are seeking risk and adventure in a high flying cooperative game which rewards both communication and cogitation, come aboard Guns of Icarus Online. We're always looking for fresh recruits, whether you know the difference betweent the bow and the stern, or aught that stems from either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played about 1500 games of this game.  This game is quite spectacular.  3 Major points for you lads:I have noticed it has a bit of a learning curve but almost everyone is totally commited to helping the new players pickup the game and learn it is such an inviting and warm community(with very few♥♥♥♥♥♥s.)  Which is very abnormal for a game.  This game will almost asuradly require 50 games to get proficent enough to play a real game.  Please hold judgements until then when you get so leet haxor pro aint no EG Huk gonna outmine you!This game is 90% of the time is spent in lobby but again almost everyone has microphones and is talkiing and great fun is being had.  Once in the game it has amazing.  THIS GAME ALMOST REQUIRES A MICROPHONE!(or 60wpm)The gameplay is repetitive but solid!  There is lots of fixing things and shoosting of the shooster at the shifty sheisters!  The gameplay again is solid!  The graphics are amazing!  Even repairing is a very rewarding expierence when you end up winning(but again repetitive)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game provides a very unique experience that you won't find in other games. You can't quite describe the feeling - when you know the ship is going down, the captain isn't even at the steering wheel anymore but huddled in a corner wondering when it all went wrong, being razed by fire on both sides, all engines failing and balloon popped, you try and jump ship only to find yourself back on board... you'll have to try it yourself to understand. Gameplay is very balanced, nice variety of ships and guns and regularly updated for new content. The only criticisms I have are some lag/disconnection issues especially on foreign servers, and graphics aren't the greatest. The community is very friendly, and very competitive. Invest in a microphone, if you want to really get into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus Online is a very fun online co-op/role-based game. It sets you in a dystopian, steampunk environment, as you and your crew man an Airship armed to the teeth. Hop in, find a good crew, and destroy your enemy!Need-to-knows:- Do all three role tutorials before starting. They are easy to figure out, but if you go into a game with no knowledge, your crew will most likely become annoyed with you.- I find this game a lot of fun by yourself, but some may not. It is definitely more fun with friends, and this game has crews of four. If you can find 3 friends, its an absolute blast!- This game has a built in push-to-talk system. If you can participate, it makes communication a lot easier. Know that a lot of users will use explicit language, but there is an audio setting just for it, you can turn it all the way down. There is even a way to completely disable it, so you won't accidentally active your audio.- It has pretty advanced graphics. I have a good computer, but an old computer. Often some things such as the flamethrower will cause my frames to drop quite low.- Each role can participate in other roles. Be prepared to adapt to many different scenarios.- AIs aren't all that bad if you have one on your crew, as captain, f1 will put them at ease. F2 will set them to attack. F3 will set them to repair! Utilize them to the furthest extent.- Faction can be changed, and it is not too important to the game. It is a lot of fun however!Roles:Engineer - Whack anything and everything, buff the engines, and keep the ship in the sky. A simple role, but a busy one.Gunner - Use the various guns to shoot down enemies. It is easy to aim, but various ammos and guns are required to take down ships. Be sure to learn whats what, after a time you can find some combos that shred through ships.Captain - Pilot the ship through thick and thin. Tell your crew what to do, play it safe and line up shots, or go in for a ram!I'd reccomend doing some 1v0 practice rounds before playing this role, and generally becoming comfortable with the controls.Ships:There are various ships in the game for various reasons. Pyramidion is best for ramming. Squid is best for speed. Galleon is a tank. Goldfish is extremely powerful, but only with a good team.I highly reccommend this game. All roles are fun, and even though its a seemingly basic game, it keeps me coming back for more!My Experience:- 26 hours in game.- I'm mostly an engineer, who usually mans the gatling part-time. I have experience as captain though, and have recieved compliments as a pilot from veterans.- I have 4 friends who own the game, as a group it can be an absolute blast, and be quite hilarious, too.

												Very enjoyable!  If you don't have friends you will definatly make some with the wonderful community that found here.  I really emphise how great it is to play a truly co-op game.  Unlike other games where you can point at the person who is messing it up, the sucess of winning is based on everyone and yet can't be narrowed down to one person.  Except maybe a lousy captain.

You get genuine teamwork and cooperation from strangers (is this still the internet?) and an immense sense of satisfaction from winning a 4v4!Mechanics and bullet drops etc are solid and the steampunk aesthetic is really cool with a large range of ships and weapons.Also there are useful tutorials so you aren't totally overwhelmed - everything makes logical sense.

Is your wish to be a captain and tell people what to do while being the hero of your ship or shoot other players ships off the sky in glorious fire and explosions or is it to repair and help your teamates survive hard hits from enemy cannons you can do it. An absoloutly amazing game. If you have a full crew ready you can expect to dominate the battlefield and feel like you achieved something. The glory of taking down another ship that has 4 people on it with your team is amazing. The community is so great you can play with randoms. Must buy.

												Guns of Icarus Online is a Steampunk Squad Based Fighter similar to Verdun. You pick from three classes: Pilot, Gunner, or Engineer and you and three of your mates fight in a Team Deathmatch or King of the Hill.For new players I recommend Engineer. Piloting has a steep learning curve, and everyone and their mother goes Gunner. If you master engineering, you will be invited to join many crews and have a better shot at applying for clans.The game requires you to work as a team, not only with your crew but the other ships on your team as well. Failure to work together -WILL- end in your defeat. So having a Microphone is a must if you are to play this game.There are Microtransactions, but only for cosmetics and they can be unlocked through gameplay anyways, so it doesn't feel like they are really there. I highly recommend this game.Graphics are good quality, this doesn't mean realistic, but it means that you do not see pixelation. Cons are: -There is no Singleplayer mode, so you will need a stable internet connection to play. -As always, it is best to play with friends as random players act like this is Rambo and will not work as a team.I rate this game a must play.

												Long story short, this game is an excellent game, and it's worth every penny.Details:STUFF I LIKE:- Gameplay in general. I like the idea of flying these airships, I like the matching system, using the weapons is good, flying the ship has great controls, engineering is pretty intuitive, it just all works really well- The teamwork specifically needs special mention. It's really great. It forces you to work with not only your crew, but your entire team. They made giving commands and orders really intuitive. Working together with your team and crew is awesome, and it makes you feel like an essential part of a team, which is something not a lot of games have. - The aesthetics are great. I just like the way it looks. I'm not a huge steampunk fan, but this game really does it well. - Character customization. This seems small, but being able to customize my character is a big deal to me, so I had to mention it. It's really good. STUFF I DON'T LIKE:- This is an issue that I guess can't really be avoided, but some of the players are hostile, and it makes them hard to work with. I know it shouldn't be a big deal, but it's really frustrating when someone won't cooperate on a game that relies heavily on cooperation. - Leveling up. This is a personal issue, but it seems like you level up WAY too slowly. It just seems like it takes an awfully long time to make any real progress. Although, that may be a by product of my next point- It takes a long time to play the game. A match usually won't start until it's mostly full, which is frustrating because filling a match can take a really long time when people are as impatient as they are. I don't know how the developers might fix this, but on the other hand, that's not really my job.- It can be a little confusing. I know this isn't a big deal, but it took me a really long time to figure out how to use all the engineering tools and how all the different types of ammo worked. I feel like these could have been explained by the game a little better, but maybe that's just me. Overall, in spite of its flaws, I think this game is worth it. It can be a little tough to get started, but once you get going, it really is a blast. If you've got some time to set aside for it, it's really a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game is Bomb! I HIGHLY recommend People who have friends and willing to work as a team! the gamme looks Sexy as my left Nipple and it really feels like you are taking control of what happens to your ship/Captains ship! Team work is Key if you wanna get out alive! the only this that upsets me about this game is that there is not enough players but there are still a few handful of people playing hopefully the DLC will make/want players to comeback! Me and my Friend havent played long but we both love the feel of this game I'm giving this Game a Rating of 9.5/10 Hope this Review has been helpful and I hope to see anyone that plays/gets the game in battle Good Luck and Have Fun!!!

Posted: December 5, 2015
Pros: This game definitely fullfills your Steampunk fetish better than any other multiplayer game out there, including the MMOs.  Despite falling squarely into a heaping pile of Steampunk tropes, the game itself is refreshing & mostly original.  Teamwork is essential on multiple levels - both with your own crewmates and the other ships on your side.  Adding built-in voice chat was a wise choice indeed (It boggles the mind just how many games out there today still expect you to be running TeamSpeak, or whatever, in another channel.)  To my pleasant surprise, the game is remarkably absent the usual armies of drooling blockheads that populate most multiplayer combat sims, and the community is refreshingly non-toxic overall.  Truly a breath of fresh air hiding amongst the fart miasma that is multiplayer competitive gaming in general.  Trolls are a rare signt indeed, and that's a great thing.The graphics are simply stunning, especially for something still running in only 32bits.  There's enough eye-candy here to impress even old vet Skyrim players.  That's not just the skybox, either.  The ships themselves, the crews, the creaking of the hulls, the puttering of the engines.  It's not just pretty pictures - it's a compelte environmental experience that works on every level and at every distance.The game mechanics are mostly well done, and while the constant juggling of weapon & ship values by the developers may seem frustrating, to me that only shows that they still care about their game and are putting forth effort to maintain balance.  The matchmaking system isn't completely broken, which is something that I honestly don't think that I've ever experienced before.Also worth noting is that here is a game that has been out for literally years and to this day all of the microtransactions are still for cosmetic items only.  Think about that.  How many games out there have made it more than six months before they started trying to sell you golden bullets?  I can think of only one, and that's this one.  So major kudos for that.Cons: Map selection is iffy, and no matter what game style you pick it always deteriorates into deathmatch in short order.  While every map creates it's own problems and opportunities, it always boils down to ""kill the other guy first"" no matter what the actual rules of the match are.  But I suppose that's true everywhere.While people are usually brilliant at coordinating with their own crews, cooperation between ships seems to be lacking outside of ""clan"" players.  Not sure why.  But that's a people problem; it has nothing to do with the developers, so they're excused on this one.Security against hackers is... questionable.  I've seen some rather improbably things happen far too many times to believe that it was always a coincidence.  I can see someone scoring a critical hit on someone from BVR into a fog cloud with a full speed defelection shot once in a blue moon.  When it happens fifteen times in a row I just log out.  Not dealing with it.The biggest problem is the emphasis on ""min/maxing"" - a problem that has plagued them since day one and persists to this day.  Simply put, some equipment when places on certain ships in certain positions is simply best and nothing else can compare.  These are not tiny differences, they are major differences.  Because of this, despite all of the tweaking by the devs and the multitude of creative options available, the reality is that every single ship hull in the game has been refined into a single, proven configuration that everybody uses.  Likewise, because of this every single ship uses exactly the same tactics to maximize that one configuration and everyone knows it.  The problem with all of that is that it reduces the vast potential for strategic possibilities into a simple game of ""rock, paper, scissors"" and the outcome of a match is often determined before it even starts.  I've watched, laughing, as people have tried to ""snipe"" ship hull/template changes in during the very last second before a match starts.  I know the devs are trying to fix this, but so far... yeah, it's not working.Conclusion: Still a very fun game.  It's beautiful, fairly original, the community is realitively polite, and it has stayed true to it's ""buy once, play forever"" goal & doesn't try to shove it's microtransactions down your throat.  For that reason it's worth the money even if you don't play that often.  Right now it's only $10 and at that price you're definitely getting more than your money's worth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING! ALL HANDS ON DECK FELLOW SHIP CREW!Do you enjoy aviation & bombarding in the skies? Do you enjoy making your crew walk the plank over 5 thousand feet in the air? And one last question before I throw you into the engine room, can you fix those darn turbines quickly? WE'RE GETTING LOW ON ALTITUDE 'COZ WE'RE BEING BLASTED TO HELL HERE!Ahh yes, the frantic & stressful situation in managing an airship while admiring the beautiful sunset as your crew members run around fixing and manning the guns. This is one of the best co-op games I've got my hands on. You can choose your own style of playing and there's plenty good airships out there; Pyramidion my darling <3 . Not to mention the chaos that errupts as you're just nonchalantly cruising in the sky when suddenly you see fire coming out of your engine from the shots of a gattling gun 200 feet across the horizon. It trains your quick wits in handling emergencies as well as keeping a mentally balanced ship crew. Just make sure your crew or captain don't throw you overboard for lazing around. You can dress up your character too! Interested in Steampunk flight? They got you covered. Don't forget to have your decorations for the ship! Keep in style while bringing down your foes to a humiliating descent to death! The levelling up system requires task related to each crew class. Your item layout should vary with your strategies too. Wanna buff up your guns and engines? Don't forget the hammer! Wanna fly like a super sonic jet? Just kidding, you can't but there's a nitro boost which you can equip as a Captain. Love setting ships on fire? Then grab the incendiary ammo as the gunner. Discuss with your crew before a game! Don't forget to discuss the whole game strategy if you're playing with 3 other ally ships. Don't worry if you're just an underdog, just reach to the skies! OH WE'RE ALREADY HERE. REMEMBER CREW MEMBERS! THE SKY IS NOT THE LIMIT! KEEP FLYING!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best game ever. A game that goes where no game has ever gone before..... which happens to be a post-apocalyptic world where relatively small airships shoot at eachother. Teamwork is needed. Very much so. If you don't have a team that will actually follow your orders, you might as well pop your own balloon.GET THIS GAME NOW IT IS FREAKING AMAZINGA Tactical Steampunk Fps that needs more attention than it currently has.27/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun 7/10^Very team dependant. One person slacking can ruin it. I have the most fun with real friends. Dont touch it much otherwise. Also, please have a mic.Graphics 6/10^Average. Not bad. Not amazing. They get the job done and will probably age nicely.Controls 10/10^ With keybindings it is hard to mess up on this. The game does what you tell it to.Replay Value6/10You can play this game forever. That would warrant a 10/10. HOWEVER, the game is not rewarding or rather, you play the same game over and over. Yes, different people make each match special.But imagine your favorite moba game. Everone has every character unlocked and there are only half as many characters. It is great fun for a while. But eventually, things get repetitive and dare I say boring.In Game Store10/10Not in your face.Purely cosmetic.Perfect.Balance5/10While the ships and weapons are balanced players are not. With a smaller community it can be difficult to fly with people of your level.That goes for within your own ship, and even against other players.If your engineer does not know what to repair, your gunner has bad aim, or your pilot turns your ship into a sitting target, it does not matter how good you are as an individual.Normally, this is where matchmaking, and some sort of player skill balance comes into play.But with a smaller community, this is not exactly the best choice to segregate players.Matchmaking5/10It can be difficult to get into a game.You can always find games.But, it can take a while.Game modes 4/10Plenty of game modes exist, and are played. I think this almost hurts the game though, because it puts players in a position of wanting to play a certain gamemode, and potentially nobody wants to play that mode. if 300 people are spread out over say 6 game modes(deathmatch,king of hill, crazy king, 2v2-3v3-4v4 etc) Not including different maps.Thats about 50 people maybe wanting to play with you. Take into consideration about 7 matches in each game mode and you are down to about 7 people trying to do what you are doing. That assumes no1 is afk or goes afk when you are making a match. To be fair, finding a match isnt always all that difficult. It more often than not requires a higher level of patience.Overall 5/10That isnt bad! It is decent, and fun will be had. It is worth a look. It is not your typical game. has its issues, but is solid fun.With actual friends 8.5/10Yes, there is a huge advantage to be had when playing with people you know and generally play games with. This is where the game shines. Plan to play with others, either make friends or get your friends to play with you. but fun will be had.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Needless to say I immediatly bought it from the store. I really appreciate the team at Guns Of Icarus. May they have the best luck in the future!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus is a game that focuses heavily on cooperation and teamwork. You and 3 friends (or complete strangers) fly on an airship trying to destroy the enemy ships before they destroy you. In order to do that, you have to work together and communicate with your team, you can't do it on your own. This has resulted in best online community I've experienced so far. The game does have a learning curve, but it is not as steep as other competitive games, and the community loves to help those who show interest in learning the ways of the game.So if you are looking for a game where you can have a nice chat with other players and work together to achieve a goal, or just like competitive games, but want to avoid the toxicity you find in many other games, give Guns of Icarus a try!

												Because of this game, i got my first clan. Its called 'BUMS', and its really cool clan. We fly the ship together, we shoot enemy's ship together, and we win the match together. This game will connect you to each other and train your teamwork skills. You always get a good moment on Gun of Icarus Online.What I Love- This game require teamwork to make the ship keep flying.- Uniqe concept. Flying ship war.- Good community.What I Don't Like- Just a few players left.I hope this game will get more players (Especially Asia region). I miss that moment when i shoot my cannonball to the hull armor's enemy ship xD8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game thinking there would be some cool engineering to do on these ships, but no such luck. All you do is run around clicking systems as they break, over and over, no steam-management type gameplay, no skill involved. Gets real boring and repetitive real fast. This is probably why the game is dead, 1 out of 3 classes is mind-numbingly boring, despite being essential to gameplay. Average of 160 players in the last 30 days and dropping steadily according to steamcharts.Only gunner and pilot are fun and take skill but you'll probably never get to play those because everyone will be trying to play gunner and pilot, avoiding boring engineer like the plague. Which is really a shame, because you can't win without an engineer, so you'll probably just end up having to choose between winning and having no fun whatsoever, or losing but at least you got to play gunner/pilot.

												This is my new favorite game. The graphics as far as maps are minimal, yet the details of the ship are quite good. What makes this game is the online gameplay, hence Icarus ""online"". You play against and with other players from all over thr world in these massive balloon ships equiped with guns and cannons. Your objective is to take out other ships of the opposing tem by working together. This game is your worst nightmare if you can't get a crew to communicate. There are 3 classes: engineer, gunner, and captain. The 3 classes can do everything each class can do, but are more suited towards their trait.  The gunner: easiest class to play... fire and shoot at the enemy team. The engineer: fix broken weapons and engines, while also putting out fires... Most crucial player.  Captain: As you can guess, mans and manuevers the ship into danger and out. Has a few perks that can help escape enemy ships. Player base quality: Harcore players, griefers, and noobs. As in everygame.  One of my favorite things about this game though is character customization. There is a store you can use (costs real money) where you can pimp out your character in hats and all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Best part is it only costs around 30 cents or less for an item.  So just buy it.... I need people to play with me and yell at russians dudes with me.  ",222,62,5,29,32,3,18

												Guns of Icarus provides a unique experience that is just as much co-op as it is competitive. Whether you're exercising the strategic daring of a captain, the skill and ferocity of a gunner, or the, uh... steadfast desperation of an engineer, you will have to work WITH the other members of your crew if you're going to pull out ahead.You won't find the frustrating -cheapness- of other competitive games here; victories are EARNED in Guns of Icarus, and every moment is a thrill.

												Highly enjoyable game with immersive battles and diverse ships and weapons.Unfortunatly, despite this being true, the game, much like a dark souls NPC (hue reference hue), is also hollow and dieing.As I write this, it physically pains me to sh*t on this game. Appart from some repetitive parts, this game is more than worth your money, IF you want to play with 2 people out of the 12 players remaining. I am literally depressing myself for writing this, but now you will rarely enjoy this game, IF EVER. The only thing that could even be close to a reviving quality to this game would be the alliance DLC coming out, but EVEN THEN the vets of this game, myself included, wont even care about the DLC, considering that most of us bought the captain's edition and more stuff, and throwing even more money at this game is simply a losing bet.To sumarize, this game is a ghost town of wonderful, but unrealized dreams and creations that, pardon the pun, sank to the bottom of the sea before it could be saved.So please, let this game die in peace...

												This game comes with a huge catch 22 for me. The game itself is a blast playing with friends is awsome and SOME random matches are fun. However I can over state this enough THE COMUNITY IS THAT OF THE STEREOTYPOICAL XBOX CALL OF DUTY LOBBY: IF YOU ARE A WOMAN TURN OFF YOUR VOICE CHAT. going into a lobby for a match and speaking has lead to more then one sexual harrasment. It complatly runined the basic game for me and now I only play with my friends. I may come back for a try again when the Allience dlc drops but that is a maybe.  However that is my only probelm with this game, it has lead to many enjoyable moments it mostly just need people to not say ""Hey i'm going to c*m in your pretty hair captian, you s**t""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's really fun when you can coordinate with 3+ people, but very rage-inducing when you can't. Enjoy watching idiots ruin your repair cooldowns by randomly smacking severely damaged things with the wrench.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is as fun as it looks. You can play as a gunner, engineer, or a pilot. Pilots usually just pilot the ship, which is quite a job in itself sometimes and gunners often have to engineer and vice versa. When 8 ships all collide in 1 spot and there is chaos going on around you, you will understand how people could get wrapped up in this game. The company that makes this game is planning a large update within the year as well which will let people do PVE with ships and not just PVP for those of you who dont only want to play against other players.

With the ability to take on the responsibilites of Captain as well as Crew and decided for yourself on being a Pilot, Engineer or Gunner, you can fly with all your favourite chaps and experience a riveting Steampunk world with some spiffing fighting gameplay. The graphics are glorious and perfect if you are sitting down to a glorious Earl Grey and biscuits! I award this fine game 5 Cups of Tea out of 5! By golly!

												Guns of Icarus is a game based on teamwork. You fly in a airship with 4 other guys. There is 3 different classes: 1 Gunner - Special in weapons. 2 - Engineer: Special in repairing the guns and engines on the ship (very important class) 3: Pilot - Nothing much to say.. Hes flying the ship and need to tell the other guys on the ship what to do. You can level up with all the 3 classes whrn you play games. Its a very good teamwork game and come up with many  different ships and different guns on the ship. I'll for sure recommend this game to everyone who loves teamwork games and playing with your friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short version: Its awesome, beware bugs and lag.I've been playing for 93 hours, and there are flaws, but I've loved all 93 hours I've sunk into this thing. The thing that keeps this game going for me is just the idea and exicution. The gameplay itself is wonderful, really reliant on teamwork and frankly, airships fighting each other without boarding is just friggen fun. But the bugs and the balance are desperate problems. Lag is sometimes like a mortal wound, bugs are lurking like traps to make you fall right through your ship, and the balance is being constantly ajusted. Such things have gotten much better since a year ago, when I joined, but I believe the developers are really working on their main project, which is adventure mode. Having only a small team working on both doesn't help either. Also it's worth mentioning that the devs talk to the community in game almost constantly.The devs are telling us that they're working to fix the game's problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is actually one of the few multiplayer games that I can actually stomach. Now, granted, even now this an unfinished game, in my opinion. But, nevertheless, I found immense joy in it.At first glance it's a simple cooperative multiplayer. And some of that simplicity stays. However the designers knew what to do to make this game enjoyable from the get-go.The whole crew is put under constant strain of keeping your ship in the air, and at the same time work on taking the opposing players' down. I would say that a certain bond is formed between the crew and the ship as every shell that hits feels like a slap across your face.From a technical standpoint the game could use some polishing, but being somewhat minimalist I find no problem with that. On no occasion have I encountered a serious, game stopping bug, although some graphical glitches still persist.All in all, a fun airship battle experience whether or not you bring friends along or join up on the spot			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of icarus online is a super unique and super fun experience. the game is an airship combat game, where you and 3 other people crew an airship and co-ordonate to take down the enemy. For those unwilling or reserved about communicating (specifically verbally but also in text) with your fellow crew members it may be a little hard for you, as this game requires a large amount communication and co-ordonataion to function as each member needs to communcate to take down the enemy, whilst also keeping your own ship airborn.guns of icarus has 3 classes. gunner, engineer and pilot. each pretty much self explanatory as to what they specialize in. each class has different loadouts and skills they can customize to the players liking, along with how they look depending if you're willing to spend more money on cosmetics. Whilst admitably lacking in differing gamemodes besides how many ships can be fighting at a time (i.e 1v1 2v2 etc) the game makes up for it with a good variety of ship and weapon choices and the fact that each battle will mostly likely not play out the same twice. one team may have an upper hand one game but be absolutely stomped the next.If the idea of airship based combat where communication with your crew is key sound good to you, you'll most likely love Guns of icarus. its an excellent game and pretty cheap to boot. 8/10			",52,3,0,12,4,1,1

Play consists of two teams of two to four airships, each with 4 crew, including the captain, facing off against each other in class PvP formats such as team deathmatch, king of the hill, and resource capture.An adventure mode/co-op mode is in the works, but currently it's just team PvP skirmishes.

												This is a wonderful game. -It delivers what it offers, a great co-op game with intense gameplay. Community is really good, everyone usually follows orders, there are no rude people/trolls etc. to ruin your game. Devs regularly play the game and really clean up foul players. But as always, there are some stubborn people that ""MUST BE A GUNNER!111!"" or sometimes an engineer not doing their job and gunning instead, but these are rare occurances. As long as someone gives the orders, such things are avoided.-Game is well balanced and benefits highly from the use of tactics. It's not a rock-paper-scissors thing either, everything works as long as you know how to use them.-Servers are working just fine, even though I'm a bit far to Europe for instance(Turkey), I get 70-100 ms ping. Which is really good.-Crashes very rarely occur, I played for about 20 hours and experienced only one crash. There are minor bugs, but no gamebreaking bugs.-It has a online shop, but it's not a pay-2-win, the items are entirely cosmetic, and quite well priced. (If you're so inclined to decorate your ship and suit up your characters, it would only cost 10 dolars.)So in the end, do buy this game if you like teamwork and wreaking havoc with a flamethrower, because that's what you'll get.

												Delicious steampunk. This game is wonderful.  Airship to airship battle with strategy and teamwork. The crew on an airship needs to work together to be the most effective and communication is key.  You can be a gunner using a variety of guns and ammo to take down enemy ships. You can be an engineer fixing damage, putting out fires, and upgrading airship components. Or you can be the pilot strategically bringing the airship in and out of combat to minimize damage taken, catch the element of surprise when possible, and to always keep the best guns for the job in range of the target. The game looks pretty good and the background music is nice. Ignore the metacritic score because it is deceiving.  This game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus Online has a wonderful teamwork aspect to it in which most other games don't really provide. Most games have a certain objective and then everyone can go off and do their own thing. With this game, you all have to work together and provide key communication in order to own the skies and take the victory.The game's graphics may not be as high as big brand games, but they sure are detailed enough to get the point across. The engine performs amazingly and I have had no trouble whatsoever in figuring out how to play. The controls are put up on screen (providing you kept the tips on) so that even the most novice of players can get a grip for the controls.Customization is also very big in this game. Not only can you customize your character's appearance, but you can customize your ship down to the last weapon. Want a flamethrower on your vessel? Go right ahead! The game already has a large selection of weapons for you to use so go ahead and use them!All in all this game is great and it really does show in the dynamic of its performance, quality, and playability. The easy controls, stunning design, and almost limitless customization makes this game perfect for those who seek action, and great team playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has what a steam punk junkie needs. Well, at least for air-ship to air-ship combat. Play a pilot and fly your ship through the maps and out wit you enemies, or shoot them down as a gunner with any of the veriety of weapons mounted on the ship or, keep your crew alive with one of the most important rolls by bashing parts back together with a wrench as an engineer. This team based game is also just as beautiful as it is spectacularly entertaining. The graphics shine brightly and have a bit of an old timely grain to them as if being watched through an old film projector and on some maps the rain splashes in your eyes obscuring your vision slightly. The best thing about this game is the community though. Developers are constantly online taking notes and playing in matches with the players and the players themselves have been nothing but friendly sore the occasional troll or angry Russian pilot. The game does fall flat on a few things though such as game type veriety and the ungodly A.I. engineers as well as some unbalanced ship builds and the fact that pilots, gunners and engineers have no significant advantage over one another accept for having more equipment for their assigned rolls. In the end the game is under constant change and I hear that more game modes are on the way, as well as maps, ships, guns and most importantly hats.Sk00mathief			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Matchmaking is still a little slow, but this seems more from people all wanting to be captain.

I'd previously been searching for a game that let you run about on a ship while working with a crew to achieve victory, and this is the only game that does it well. Repair the ship, pilot it, or man the guns; all are essential to a succesfull crew. Do note that they are making co-op and singeplayer content in the future as a free update, but for now it is just match-based multiplayer.			",85,12,1,15,16,0,32

												This is actually one of the few multiplayer games that I can actually stomach. Now, granted, even now this an unfinished game, in my opinion. But, nevertheless, I found immense joy in it.At first glance it's a simple cooperative multiplayer. And some of that simplicity stays. However the designers knew what to do to make this game enjoyable from the get-go.The whole crew is put under constant strain of keeping your ship in the air, and at the same time work on taking the opposing players' down. I would say that a certain bond is formed between the crew and the ship as every shell that hits feels like a slap across your face.From a technical standpoint the game could use some polishing, but being somewhat minimalist I find no problem with that. On no occasion have I encountered a serious, game stopping bug, although some graphical glitches still persist.All in all, a fun airship battle experience whether or not you bring friends along or join up on the spot			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns of Icarus is a steampunk airship battle simulator where you run around on the deck of an airship repair stuff, mount guns and pilot it and fight enemy airships together with 4 teammates. Crewing up with random poeple works reasonably well, but the game begins to shine when you find a crew where you work together via voicechat.The Game is not packed with features, but Gameplay is super solid and it just delivers the experience so well.So in short, i like it a lot!

												This game is beautiful in the sense that you have to communicate heavily with your allies. Sure most games understand the same principle, but there is way more to this game. Whether  you are flying your airship, or repairing it, the amount of communication needed is impeccable. I love this game as it is constantly changing, where the same strategy doesn't always work. Not to mention that the artwork in the game is pure bliss. Would Recommend anyday.10/10 would torch a blimp again.			",147,16,3,11,31,1,16

												Guns of Icarus flys way under the radar and is heavily underappreciated. It is a steam punk masterpiece tackling a style of game play that few have ever tried and most have failed. The game is imersive and beautiful with very in depth, yet simple enough mechanics you can grasp within you first hours of gameplay. Definitely a game to be played with friends for some all out fun, competitive or casual.			",521,151,26,75,80,8,100

												Very solid gameplay mixed with strong focus on teamwork makes for a amazing areal-dogfighting, steampunk, MOBA-Styled game. Each class feels strong without becoming overpowered. There is plenty of variation with different ships, load outs, items, ect. I would highly recommend you buy the four pack and play with a full crew. The only downside a small community. Middle of the day has 3000 people on, which make some queue times long. But, don't let that deter you from picking up this awesome game. Defiantly a good addition to my steam library.

												I recommend this game for all who loves steampunk and FPS games. But these are not exactly what describes this game. I love it because it leads me into a world, where I have to be strategical and communicate with teammates to earn the victory. My most used role is steerer, and I love how I can lead my crew into the battle, and how much we can achive with simple instructions. In this game you have! to communicate, or else you lose. If there is a good pilot, he/she is nothing without a crew that can repair the engines, baloon and others, and vice versa. There is a good engineer or gunner, but a bad pilot, you can repair as much as you want, if he/she doesn't go away of the gunfire when needs. So godd luck for everyone, and be communicative, and don't be mad on others, help them!			",223,37,10,35,10,3,31

												The feel and thrill you get when engaging in ship to ship combat and having to rely not only on your personal skills but on your own crew mates' as well is something you don't usually find in gaming.This is a game about cooperation and communication in a way that ""realistic"" war games fall short miles from.It is the most rewarding online experience I've had in years. Unique gameplay experience. Keeping me at the edge of my seat in a way I haven't seen in ages.Picture a stylish steampunk balloon under enemy fire: the Engineers are running around putting out fires and frantically fixing components, barely keeping up with the mounting damage; the Gunners are trying to return the damage they are taking with interest and maybe neutralize the enemies' guns and vital components to give themselves better odds before their own guns are taken out; the Captain is flying a ship with half the engines blown, the best gun out of commission and the balloon about to burst has to decide whether he can attempt to make a run for it or if it is better to bring all guns to bear and go down in a blaze of glory.

Seriously, i've just started to play the game and the feel of ""steampunk"" is soo unique, you'll have 3 classes to work with and with each class have their advantages.if you're just starting out, it's highly recommended to  go through the basics so you'll know how to work with what and who.Voice communication makes this game even MORE enjoyable, coz when you're flying into the battlefield, all of the team members will shout like, "" this is spartaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"" and the captain will say, "" Arrrrrrrr, me booty is shakin like a storm ya see"".ya see what i mean?i'll give this game an easy 8/10			",162,7,4,5,9,2,6

												Guns of Icarus as a steampunk based zeppelin battle game consisting of the gamemodes Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill and Conquest; all the while with enviromental hazards and beautiful ethreal landscapes. This game is great for those that communicate via mic. Allthough mic communication is a strong suit, it is also a down fall. This game requires people to do certain specific jobs, so If the pilot and crew (Gunners/Engineers) dont inform eachother of their situation, the ship will breakdown in fire and eventually blow up. Everyone seems pretty up to speed though. The mic is particularly most important for the captain, If there is no mic available the player can proceed to use key voice commands. It is pretty much pirate ships powerd by Balloons and Engine Propellers.  The guns themself are a much different calibur then a typic pirate ship. Which forces decisive planning. The community itself is a bunch of characters. This is a very multicultural game where i've run into people from Europe and the U.k. (I live in the U.S.)  In the end, victory feels really like an acomplishment, which is always a plus in games. If anyone is interested in buying this, know your tools and abilities (4 slots to swap out in the lobby), it really helps due to the games being open match. Real people real trash talk consequences, and as for people on the internet go, they can be harsh, but as for the main tip, stay informed!  10/10 for maintained interest.			",46,7,0,4,3,0,0

												Pros + Cons-+Community+Gameplay+Ship customization+Class customization+Music+Atmosphere-Microtransaction cosmetics-Terrible AI-Player animationsFinal Score: 7/10If you love games with teamwork, games with great communities, or games with huge clunky armed airships, then I suggest this game.When you first go into the game, you are treated with an excellent theme song.  The string instruments mixed with cannon shots mixed with propellers really set the tone for the game.  I find myself humming the theme song whenever I start the game.Jumping into the tutorial, I felt a bit overwhelmed.  It's telling you to do all of this stuff and at the time I didn't know what the hell they were talking about.  But if you just just take is slowly then you will be able to understand.  If you have any question, just type it into the global chat and people would be happy to answer!The character customization is great and all, but for most of it you have to pay.  If this game was free to play than I would be fine with it, but the game is $15 full price, so it's not ideal.  It's not just character cosmetics, but ship cosmetics as well. However, there is some items you can get by leveling up, I was informed you could battle the devs every Tuesday and Thursday to get some snazzy cosmetics.Thankfully, you can customize both your ship and character layout.  You are given an ample amount of ship types to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, they are all very different from each other.  Not to mention that the game also has a bunch of weapon choices, all have unique uses.  Experimenting with different ships, guns, and even ammo is a hell of a ride.When you're customizing your character loadout, you have a choice of three classes: Pilot, Engineer, and Gunner.  You also have three catagories of items, each one corresponds to a class.  You can pick one item from two catagories, and three from another catagory, it all depends on your class.  If you're a gunner, you can pick one pilot item, one engineer item, and three gunner items.  It's a good system.The game requires coordination, so make sure you talk with your crew about a plan before the game starts, it will help out a lot trust me.  You'll have time to do this, due to the fact that it takes a while for a game to start most of the time.  This is because not many people play the game, so it takes a bit for the lobbies to fill.I'm not going to say much about going into your first battle, because I don't want to spoil the feeling.  All I have to say is, hold on to your♥♥♥♥♥because you're going on a wild ride.I recommend you go in with a full crew, not AI.  The AI is horrid in this game, it is impossible to win with a crew full of them.This next complaint is small, but it just bugs me a bit that the player animations are lazy.  I don't know how to explain it, but they aren't great.In conclusion, this game has a great atmosphere and great gameplay.  Just a few small gripes keep it from being pefect, so my final score is 7/10.  Go check it out.			",67,13,0,8,7,0,7

												Guns of Icarus Online - Now there's a unique, little game. Set in a steampunky universe, you and three friends/randoms/AIs man a heavily armed airship through treacherous cliffsides or dusty dunes and engage the enemies 1-4 ships at range or in tight dogfights. The arsenal of weapons is decent, with new ones added through patches. A few different ships allow you to play the game like you want it - as a fast, harassing mosquito or as a well-armed and armoured battleship. As with weapons, new ships have been announced and will probably be added eventually. As far as customisation goes, currently you can only modify the character you play as, give him/her a nice outfit, a hat and accessories. According to the devs there will even be a sort-of open world aspect in the near future, allowing you to play as a merchant, pirate or mercenary. Even now, though, the game is definitely worth checking out if you want something that stands out. Heaps of fun with some buddies!			",218,34,4,40,54,1,46

												You get into a lot of games with players that don't listen and incendiary players and players that have no intention to learn. Sometimes the matchmaker is slow, and if you're a captain type like me it takes a while to get into the swing of things, with a pretty steep curve. But then you get into a match where everyone is working in sync, everything clicks, and it all becomes worth it. And in these instances you will get the best multiplayer team experience I believe to currently be in existance. You become a well oiled kill-machine intent on making every opponent you meet into a scaled to life model of the hindenberg. Also the devs are really cool and really active with the community, which is a refreshing change of pace.			",79,13,1,18,11,0,8

												This is the ultimate teamwork-centered game.You play as one man on an airship. An airship that requires a pilot, gunners for each weapon, and mechanics to repair everything on the fly. You have three other players with you, one allied airship with its crew, and two enemies with their crews.Alone you will die. Together you will devastate.Dramatics aside, this is a game where you MUST work as a team. Gunners must talk to their captains to line up shots and coordinate damage types for best effect, engineers must time their wack-a-mole repair circuits to keep the armor solid and balloon floating, and the Captain must bring it all together as they try and manouver a eight-ton ship through clouds and desolate landscapes to evade and return fire. Let me be clear: you NEED A MIC to to play and enjoy this game.There are no gameplay-affecting microtransactions, only cosmetic, and all gear and ship options are unlocked from the start, so you will not get demolished by a Rank 14 ship because he had a better gun that you. The Achivement-based ranking system is a little weird, but gives a pretty good indication of how experienced a player actually is.The community is wonderful, as those that play actually want to play as a team, because that is the only way to win. A few screaming nine-year-olds that insist they are amazng captains show up every once in a while, and a few obnoxious jokers, but all-in-all the biggest annoyance is a captain without a mic (which is a completly valid excuse to bail from a lobby). Wonderful game, super-competitive, super tactical, and you have an excuse to talk like a Brit. I mean, come on! Steampunk Airship Battles! You have to put on a accent!			",61,13,0,17,6,0,4

												This game is so much fun to play. There are several classes you can play as; engi, gunner and pilot or captain class. Gunners are obviously responsible for shooting the enemies, destorying parts on their ships, and ultimately their goal is to kill them. There are many different guns and ammo types. Of course, for different gun different ammo is needed because it works in the gun better and is more effective at destorying the enemy. Typically your captain will suggest ammo but you may want to ask them what they want. OH, and always check the captains ship load out so you can see what guns are on there and if you already know what ammo works best equip it and double check with captain. Engis are like the glue of the whole airship, they are responsible for rebuilding parts on ship that have been destroyed, restoring health to damaged ship parts, and putting out fires, buffing equipment etc. The captain is the ships ""brains"", they steer the ship, use their captain tools to make the ship go faster, higher etc. Its loads of fun to play with your friends because it is an online mutliplayer you are always playing with people, making new friends. It also has clans that you can join and become part of their extended family and things. Its quite fun and i'd recommended any one buy it when it is onsale, seeing as its a good use of money and can be played for hours on end. I'd also recommend doing the tutorial b/c ppl get mad at new players often for just jumping on into games especially when they don't listen to load out recommendations or seem to know what they are doing on the ship. Plus doing the tutorial gives you a better understand of the classes and their specific roles on the ship.			",163,47,3,25,14,3,12

												Pretty good game, the controls are fairly well done and flying a ship is pretty easy. To make your life easier please play this with friends as it makes it much easier for coordinating attacks on other players vessels. I'd rate it atleast 7.5/10 as it still needs a bit of work.

												This game. I love it. I've loved ever since i first played it, I enjoy every aspect of battle, the aeronautical genius of the devs when they planned this game, is strikingly beautiful. This game is well worth the money it costs, but there is just one problem. The population has dwindled quite a bit from when i first began playing some year or so ago. I would log in every day and see about 1,000-2,000 people on, and finding a match was easy. But now theres usually only about 200 people on, for a good day that is. The population has a big spike when the game goes on sale, but Guns of Icarus is so amazing I wish it would have a steady population.I recommend this game, you can still find matches, the community is generally very nice. there are times where people are a little stressful, but overall the game is worth it.

But when I saw the big Youtubers playing it i thought I would give it a second chance. I played for another five hours, and the next day I couldn't even find a match.

												If you are expecting a full-blown MMO that takes place in the skies, this game isn't for you. If however, you would like some 16 player 4 ship multiplayer battles in the sky, in the style of a MOBA, then you will have a blast. The game is very well balanced, and stresses teamwork more than being a good shot/pilot/engineer, which is aided by the team and lobby voice chat built in. This game is a blast, and having gotten the collectors edition with 3 extra copies of the game, I am able to have a full crew of me and 3 friends for just 7.50, thanks to the recent sale. For someone who does not like MOBAs, or FPS's, this game is a blast, and I can already see myself sinking massive numbers of hours into it. 4 stars.2 year edit:Game is still going strong, has regular surges of people everytime it goes on sale, to about 1000-2000 players on at a time, and then drops down to about 250 during the off-sale times. Few recent updates revamped some of the strategies, and balanced out a lot of weapons and loadouts, so no more gatling-moartar pyrimidions blotting out the skies with their sheer numbers. Still would recomend picking up the 4 pack of the game, it's dropped down to 7.25 on at least 6 occasions I can recall. This is a blast to play with friends, and I will keep playing this until star citizen comes out and I can play this with spaceships. 5 stars.			",94,10,2,10,6,0,5

												This is an awesome game: great combat, details design and a pleasantly gritty yet grand aesthetic. The amazing airshi[ battles of this game are not won by any single person alone, but by multiple players working together in the different roles on individual ships. As a result, it is best to play with a group of friends. Seriously, this game needs more teamwork than a MOBA, so much more. The only real downside to this game is that not enough people play, making it take quite a long time to find a match, usually. however, there are forums in which players schedule games, which helps to mitigate this problem. YOU can fix this problem, by giving this game a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time of writing I have enjoyed my first 12 hours of the game. To give a bit of background, I prefer to play with friends rather than on my own or with random strangers in any game.Get one or two friends together and your sure to have a good time. You don't have to be able to shoot straight (unless you're a gunner) and you don't have to be an able pilot (unless you're playing pilot) thanks to the engineer class who is in charge of keeping the ship together, putting out and preventing fires, and buffing the weapons and engines to give an edge to the battle.AI crewmen are second rate compared to human players and I recommend that you get as many people together as possible before starting the match; this is where the game shows its negative side, it can take ages to get a match going as the smallest matches require 4 ships with at least 1 human captain each.The community has been nice thus far, aside from the odd♥♥♥♥♥♥measuring flame war, most players you meet are either dead silent or pleasant to talk with. The game comes with a wide variety of airships for different play styles, all of which are unlocked from the beginning (unless you are playing in ""novice matches""). Each ship can be equiped your own custom load out of guns, it is highly recommended that you (as designer) listen to your gunners request for which guns they want on it, otherwise you may alienate them.

												This game is fantastic, and I love what the developers are doing with it. Its constantly being updated, and is probably one of my favourite multiplayer games; it has got something for everyone. Love leading  a team into combat and supporting them by getting them in just the right position like myself? Play pilot. Rather shoot down enemies witha variety of guns and bullet buffs, darting from position to position and yelling at your captian for not getting into the right postion at the right time? Play gunner. And if you would prefer to get yelled by everyone while keeping the ship in the air and running around like a mad man, you would make the perfect engineer. While I know that my review involves a lot of yelling, the community is amazing and on that I'm proud to be a part of. Ignore the Metascore. This game is amazing. Allons-y!			",66,4,0,9,5,0,1

												Guns of Icarus is in a nutshell, an FPS version of FTL but in its own way, its very unique. In a almost sprawling lore into a steampunk universe, a crew of 4 including you consiting of engineers, gunners and pilots, you and you crew work together in PvP matches to not only keep your ship afloat, but to make sure others dont do the same. With a range of weapons, from massive long-range mortors to short range flmaethrowers, you will find your place in a massive range of ships from the gun-heavy Galleon to the light and versatile Squid. You as a player will be immensly unique to others, with costumes consisting of hats, suits, glasses and so forth to your very characters skills in engineering, shooting, piloting and, (stressing this!), Leadership.Its now up to you. Will you conquer the skies through immense brute force and willingness to prevail? Or will you be cunning and corageous amongst your crew members and carry your reputation across the plains of sand and steel?			",75,11,0,12,17,3,22

												This game is amazing.It's the next level of cooperation. You are not just a team pursuing a single goal.4 players here are part of an organism. Everybody is doing the best He can to keep the ship afloat. Pilot and 3 engineers / gunners are moving in one motion alike. Community is amazing, i haven't once seen anyone rage over losing. It always ends with a GG. ""What if i am bad, if i make mistakes?"" We are people. We make mistakes. We learn.And this community knows that. You'll be taught by better players, not looked down on.Obviously for Your own good it's best to keep to novice matches at begining. :) Now, how about those devs? They are great people. How do i know? You can test the game with them. Every saturday You can join a CO-OP match on newest dev patch, testing features and hunting bugs. They are polite and nice.Want to know Their history? Look up ""Guns of icarus development Lore"" on Youtube. You'll see how hard They worked to accomplish what They have now. This rises another question. What DO They have now?A nearly bugless amazing experience bonding players together in the blast of FLAK explosions. As a in-real sailor and steampunk enthusiast, this is a must have.

												This is an awesome game: great combat, details design and a pleasantly gritty yet grand aesthetic. The amazing airshi[ battles of this game are not won by any single person alone, but by multiple players working together in the different roles on individual ships. As a result, it is best to play with a group of friends. Seriously, this game needs more teamwork than a MOBA, so much more. The only real downside to this game is that not enough people play, making it take quite a long time to find a match, usually. however, there are forums in which players schedule games, which helps to mitigate this problem. YOU can fix this problem, by giving this game a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fun game with 3 other friends or more. Reason I recommend 3+ friends is because it takes 4 players to control the ships, and to have 4 players using mics helps a lot with communication for navigating and killing the enemy. You have to have someone fly the ship, at least one person shooting the guns at the enemy ships, and usually two players repairing the ships parts (ship haul, balloon, engines, guns, etc). It's a fun game all around that will give hours of enjoyment.P.S. Watch out for the players that just ram ships. It takes the fun out of the game, and it's pretty annoying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												for 3.75 its worth it. Servers are some what full. The population is there.A bit hard to grasp but the tutorial modes really help on you to learn about and the difference between rebuilding and fixing.Piloting and gunning.You start off as a novice rank thus only allowing you to two ships with preset weapons. But you can easily just turn of the option and starting fighting people and piloting and using your own gun enplacements.Bewared its best to fight against some novice matches to understand and learn.Pros: + no serious grinding. You get all the guns and ships off the bat if you turn the novice options off.+ fun team game like TF2.+ easy controls. Cons: - griniding if you want to level up for your epenis.  leveling up gives you cosmetic clothing for your character and dye like the paints of TF2.- Leveling up system. its not by xp or winning. Its done by doing achievements. Some achievements wants you to rebuild an engine. I will thus instead of fixing the engine I let it get destroyed to farm my achievements. Leads to players wanting to be self serving but this not an issue from most people I noticed.- personal opinon. Game play design. A terrible  crew/pilot will lead one player being the full time engineer to fix, buff, rebuild like a slave. While everyone else gets to shoot or pilot. Unless you enjoy clicking at stuff all the time. You will playing support role all the time running from bow to stern fixing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Atleast your a team player I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really innovative, fun and challenging game. My suggestion? Play with 3 other friends to get the most out of this game. When you do that, I promise you that it will be worth it. The only bad I have to say about this game is that the main menu layout gives too much info to the newbie and you can easily get lost on the menus. Also I would like the game to run a bit smoother sometimes. I have a pretty decent pc rig and at certain points the game lags for a second or so, but it doesn't ruin the whole experience so it's something minor. Overall great work devs, thank you for that game and keep updating the title.			",40,5,2,4,3,0,7

												For an indie game, this game is DEFINITELY WORTH the asking price! The game takes a bold direction by putting players in flying airships in a fancy steampunk- themed world. Teamwork is essential here, as you and three other players, each playing one of 3 different roles: Gunner, Engineer, and Pilot...must work together in order to ensure a decisive victory over your opponents in the skies! Gameplay is fun, addictive, and well- balanced (for the most part). A fresh change of pace from your typical team- based pvp game. It's just such a shame this game isn't more well- known....Highly recommend playing this game with a group of friends.			",98,9,0,21,8,0,13

												This game has what a steam punk junkie needs. Well, at least for air-ship to air-ship combat. Play a pilot and fly your ship through the maps and out wit you enemies, or shoot them down as a gunner with any of the veriety of weapons mounted on the ship or, keep your crew alive with one of the most important rolls by bashing parts back together with a wrench as an engineer. This team based game is also just as beautiful as it is spectacularly entertaining. The graphics shine brightly and have a bit of an old timely grain to them as if being watched through an old film projector and on some maps the rain splashes in your eyes obscuring your vision slightly. The best thing about this game is the community though. Developers are constantly online taking notes and playing in matches with the players and the players themselves have been nothing but friendly sore the occasional troll or angry Russian pilot. The game does fall flat on a few things though such as game type veriety and the ungodly A.I. engineers as well as some unbalanced ship builds and the fact that pilots, gunners and engineers have no significant advantage over one another accept for having more equipment for their assigned rolls. In the end the game is under constant change and I hear that more game modes are on the way, as well as maps, ships, guns and most importantly hats.Sk00mathief			",42,5,0,17,11,0,6

												Definetly my favourite ""indie"" title. With the new adventure mode update coming out, this game has the potential to make me forget about all other games. You coordinate with your crew as you battle flying airships above deserts, water and even between buildings of a destroyed city. A bit of a steep learning curve, but as long as you have a headset and the will to cooperate, you'll have a blast.			",137,20,2,9,9,2,21

												Wicked fun, and very different from other online games! Great community that is very helpful with newcomers, plenty of patient people that make getting into the game a very pleasant experience. Best played with a mic (especially if you're piloting) as efficient communication is key in this game. Sealed lips sink ships... they're not kidding! Guns of Icarus should be a mandatory team-building exercise for any office. ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Generally a great game, ESPECIALLY if you have friends to play it with, never seen a game with such great teamplay connection and various mechanics where you need different kinds of people like driving, shooting and repairing, this game is really good when you are with 3 more friends and RPing the crap out of it.Although I feel like this game needs a bit of work on the starting menu because the interface feels a bit clunky and confusing to me aaaaand i don't know... more features? it feels a bit ""empty"", but maybe it's just me that didn't explore the game enough.7/10			",106,10,4,18,10,1,20

												This team based game with battle zeppelins, it's post-apocaliptic steapunk/dieselpunk based setting. Guns of Icarus are a teamwork nor merely team based game, and I havent seen any game better at it thus far. You are 1 of 4 ship's crew members and your goal is to destroy enemy airships. You can't target other players, you can target only ships and various components on the ships. Teamwork is a requirement if you want to win or have fun (there is a lof of fun to be had with proper people). The community is generally very friendly.Bringing a team of friends is helpfull, but it's not necesarry as you can easily find good teammemebers in matches.			",131,17,1,30,7,1,34

												Guns of Icarus is a great game but is absolutely FANTASTIC with a full crew of friends. There are a lot of microtransactions, but the affects they have are purely cosmetic, so it's not a pay-to-win game. This game requires strategy on every front, from dealing with the enemy ships all the way down to what to repair on your ship first, so whoever has the biggest gun doesn't necessarily win every time (though that does help). The importance of each station (Pilot, gunner, and engineer) in every situation is great so nobody feels left out of the chaos. Overall I love this game and give it a 9.2/10.			",54,3,0,7,3,0,2

												I'll have to split my review into two parts, one for the game itself and another for the community of players I've encountered:1.) The Game: Guns of Icarus is a steampunk-themed airship combat game with 4 players to a ship. Between them the roles of gunner (primary gun user), engineer (repairs/rebuilds/puts out fires/enhance equipment) and pilot (pilots, obviously) are assigned. It's a beautiful game, and the variety of ships and gun types allows a crew to tailor to their fighting style very well. Piloting controls are a little awkward, but that's likely by design. It relies heavily on communication, so playing with friends is best, but that leads me to the second part...2.) The Community: This game has one of the best community of players I have ever seen. Although there are a few bad apples, the majority of players I've randomly queued with have been good-natured, communicate well, and don't talk other team members down. This, in my opinion, makes the game go from good to great. If you have to queue yourself, it's not something to dread, you can still find very fun groups to play with. Just have your headset ready, or type quickly, because you MUST communicate.			",111,7,0,23,17,0,26

												Don't be discouraged by metacritic - read user reviews if you must.I don't remember when I have played some multiplayer game that is so unique. It's not simply team-based game that you are just scoring by killing enemy but the key to victory is teamwork. Destroying enemy is also important but in order to do so teamwork is necessary. You are one of 4 crew ship member and you playing as pilot, gunner or engineer. It's not like these are locked classes, but you are choose what you want to do and what you are good at. What's even more amazing is how great community in Guns of Icarus Online is. Even with low level players, everybody tries to do their best in order to win. I'm not big fan of steampunk and to be honest I had hard time trying to play this game, at first it looked ""meh"" but I don't regret it, once I tried and I really like this game. It's nothing like any FPS games, MOBA or other genre that are avaible. Guns of Icarus Online is truly unique as multiplayer game.			",1737,716,60,244,224,20,321

Regardless the price.1000000 /10!P.S You somewhat have to use a mic in this game(Even though they added voice commands by clicking on V, because it isn't easy to ask for help while you are hammering the hull to prevent your ship from exploding), I am not the type to do that but because of this game I started.

												A competitive ship based game that relies on group cooperation and crew communication, Guns of Icarus is a unique team multiplayer experience. You play as one of three roles on a steampunk style airship as part of a crew of four. You then work together with your fellow players to keep the ship in prime condition as you engage other vessels. Pilots take the helm, engineers make sure everything is at prime condition, and gunners fire upon threats. No one is more important than the other and there is no emphasis on becoming the star player. The best players are cogs in a well oiled machine along with their crew, as it's their ship that's the star.While I think this game is definitely worth full price, as a strategy I suggest grabbing this game during any kind of sale and if you enjoy it, then make up the difference by purchasing some of the cosmetic microtransactions available. This is not play to win. All ships and weapons are unlocked from the start, but if you wish, you can purchase little bits and bobs to make your character look good and make a special outfit for each class. Additionally, an adventure mode DLC is coming soon which will contain a cooperative campaign, so even more reason to fly with some friends!Aesthetically, the game looks stellar with fantastic environments to fly along and beautiful skies. The music is atmospheric and tense all at once, not taking away from the experience. Subjectively, character models look good for the most part, but male faces leave something to be desired and there are some blurry textures on pieces of the environment yet the ships themselves are lovingly put together and textured.The gunplay with the weapons feels good, and depending on the weapon you have, you can tell there's a lot of power behind it. Some weapons feel a bit lackluster, like the gatling gun. While it does a great job in damaging an enemies hull, it just doesn't sound like a powerful gatling gun as you'd expect. That's really the only weapon I've found that doesn't feel great handling. Additionally, it's absolutely amazing (Or terrifying if it's the enemy) seeing a vessel firing their payloads on another.Controls wise, this game handled great. Flying a ship feels realistic, momentum plays a factor, and you do feel like you are actually piloting something. Running around on foot is just like any FPS and is perfectly responsive (Just don't forget to turn off mouse smoothing). Keep in mind, that while you can control the character like an FPS, it's not an FPS. Boarding is not a factor and for good reason. It's not about killing players, it's about killing ships (Which have players on them), and players must work together to do such.In conclusion, the developers seem very excited to continue improving their game and just looking on the forums show they are quite dedicated to it. If you're at all interested in an awesome multiplayer experience that focuses on ship crews and working together, then take to the skies!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game about having teams of four each in one flying zeppelin-like ship trying to blow up the enemy's vessels at the same time they try to hold their own together in one piece. Whether the objective is just destroying the opposite team, capture a point or any other thing, team work is essential to keep the ship flying. There are three classes you can pick: Pilot (usually the crew captain as well, since he is the one chosing the ship; has perks for piloting), Gunner (packs different kinds of ammunition to supply the ship's weapons) and Engineer (has multiple repairing tools and sometimes buffers to face any damage the ship could suffer). While any class can do any job, each one has something in which he is better at than any other. You can use the ship's guns to shoot the enemy's and depending where you hit, the rival vessel will recieve damage in different coponents and then suffer negative effects until repaired. Team work will be needed both between ships in the same team and within the ship's crew itself. Better bring some friends.+ Good graphics and entretaining gameplay.+ Multiple ships to try out, each of them with customizable layout. All have strengths and weaknesses.+ Three customizable classes to play.+ The battle system is great and intense. Will require a lot of strategy.+ All ships, weapons, tools and perks are available from the start, but you'll have to choose which ones you want.- If the crew doesn't work together, or at the very least follow the captains commands, the ship is doomed. Period. You can still loose by playing alongside the team, but not doing that almost grants that you won't win. Building up a crew just with friends is most of the times the best thing you can do.- Is almost mandatory to have a microphone when playing this game, or otherwise being a fast typer, since you'll have to communicate with the rest of the crew if you want to have any chance of winning.- The ""Novice Player"" status is given to you automatically until you reach level four in any of the classes, which doesn't allow you to use some ships and forces certains layouts in the one you can use, and that kindda sucks. However, it can be disabled in the configuration menu.This game gets a 8 out of 10.			",71,12,0,11,10,0,8

												It's the existence of this game that makes me question my own metacritic, elitist, mentality. The game is constantly updated, I'm starting to wonder if they will ever stop, especially as this is not an early release title, so all the extra content gradually builds up to show off a very dedicated team and a game that is always trying to evolve, little by little. The comunity is such a nice size a match with the developers is never far out of reach.			",381,106,4,59,39,1,74

												Really fun game especially with friends.The game requires teamwork between the crew members and other ships to fight the enemies successfully.There are many things to learn to do well in game with the three classes pilot engineer and gunner. I do recommend this game whoever likes action game (blasting some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ airships) that requires mechanical skill and teamwork.Graphics are good.Almost and no bugs or any lags, and if someone disconnects or leaves AI will switch the player to keep it fair.Sounds and music are cool.Game contains voice chats.Doesn't get boring that easily, can be played for a long time and still have fun.Get your crew or join one and I will see you in the skies!

However the failing was always a lack of players, making matchmaking near on impossible.The devs are still updating this game, so I gave it another go. Matchmaking is still a little slow, but this seems more from people all wanting to be captain. I love this game, and I'd reccomend getting back in the saddle of it if you havn't already.COMMUNICATION IS KEY!And don't jump off the side of the ship... you do die...			",97,9,13,10,41,0,13

There is a small learning curve to be had, however you can pick the game up very quickly if you listen to the vets.  I've only myself played gunner, and Eng (two of three roles).  I've enjoyed both of them.  To anyone looking for a good online game, this is worth the money.  First time I saw it was on the PS4 display at work, and now that there is a PC verison, I will def be playing it :D			",58,3,0,8,5,0,4

												Short version: Its awesome, beware bugs and lag.I've been playing for 93 hours, and there are flaws, but I've loved all 93 hours I've sunk into this thing. The thing that keeps this game going for me is just the idea and exicution. The gameplay itself is wonderful, really reliant on teamwork and frankly, airships fighting each other without boarding is just friggen fun. But the bugs and the balance are desperate problems. Lag is sometimes like a mortal wound, bugs are lurking like traps to make you fall right through your ship, and the balance is being constantly ajusted. Such things have gotten much better since a year ago, when I joined, but I believe the developers are really working on their main project, which is adventure mode. Having only a small team working on both doesn't help either. Also it's worth mentioning that the devs talk to the community in game almost constantly.The devs are telling us that they're working to fix the game's problems.			",53,8,0,11,4,0,2

												If you ever wanted to be a mighty sky pirate piloting your own ship and crew, an engineer who franticly runs between the upper and lower decks of the ship repairing stuff of your flying metal coffin, or a gunner who is just a tad bit to enthusiastic to be disabling the enemies ship systems 1 by 1 like their that creepy kid on the playground that tears the limbs off of insects, Guns Of Icarus may just be the 4 player multiplayer co-op for you!Since you will be stuck on a small ship with 3 other players, teamwork is a must if you wanna keep that hunk of junk in the sky making you only as strong as your weakest link. The online community is rather great when it comes to this concept, and most of them have mics so you can still have quite a bit of fun, even if your friends don't seem to be all that interested in joining you for some co-op aerial combat goodness.The ships all handle relatively smoothly, and offer a difference that makes each one feel just a slight bit varried. Wether you're using the Squid for hit and run tactics, the Pyramidion for those that like to get in close, stay close, then ram the opponent as a final insult to injury, or the Galleon. A massive warship built to tank, and give as good as it can get to any of those more fragile ships. The guns your ship comes equipped for the most part feel right, the majority of which are projectile based and not hit-scan. Projectiles meaning of course they have to travel through the air and are effected by your ship as it sways and turns, and hit-scan meaning it deals damage instantly as soon as you click on an enemy ship. The only gun I've noticed some hickups with is the flare which never seems to want to go anywhere near the target at mid range no matter how you aim it.The game has a few weird hangups. Namely the push to talk lag for anyone using a laptop to play, some latency issues which aren't a major problem since the game isn't an fps, and an occasional weird glitch or bug where you might just suddenly fall off the ship, or not be piloting it. Thankfully the bugs aren't frequent enough to be a real bother.If you're looking for a multiplayer experience that thrives on communication, have a hankering for some aerial combat, and can look past a few of the rough edges you'll be in for a good time.

												An excellent game with an even better community, which is mainly what makes it so great. The gameplay itself is often manic, and extremely good fun - but you'll need to collaborate with your 3 other crewmates in order to take down enemy ships (I cannot stress enough how important it is to have good communication with your crew, as well as good tactics). The voice chat feature makes this very easy, but if you don't fancy speaking to strangers over the internet, there's a text chat option as well - most people are very friendly! Communication and familiarity with your crewmembers is greatly aided by the clan system, which forms the basis of the online community: you can get to know people in your clan and develop rivalries with other clans, against whom your clan may be pitted in the frequent tournaments that take place. Tactics play as important a part as execution in this game, with captains of the ship able to change ship loadouts to suit their crew and opponents; ship customisation is also available. All three roles of gunner, engineer and pilot are very fun to play, and you'll soon find which one you like best - most people start with engineer as it is often the most straightforward, at least when you're new to the game. There is a fairly comprehensive tutorial system inbuilt, as well as the game forums for more information and excellent community guides. My only complaint would be that it takes a very long time to level up all of your classes, as this is done by earning achievements and not directly controlled by the amount of time spent playing the game: but this is clearly a deliberate choice made by the developers (who, incidentally, are very active in the community) and you still have a great time playing the game.In short, an excellent little game that will keep you absorbed for a long time as you grow familiar with its nuances and finer tactics.

												Guns of Icarus has turned out to be one of my favorite games. The game has a great setting (steampunk and flying). Gameplay is really focused on teamwork, skill, and strategy. Everyone is on a level playing field. Your 'level' doesn't affect gameplay, a lvl 1 and a lvl 45 character are eually effective (aside from all the practice that the lvl 45 has...). Games are generally quick (~10-15 mins).The in-game store sells ONLY vanity items.Finally, the game is FUN!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is over the standard of fun. It has a very high replay value due to every ship being different that the other and the amazing ammount of customization you can have.

												Un gran juego y si te gusta la simulacion es super recomendado nadie que tenga alma de pirata puede perderse este juego mi barco se llama popeye el marino (popeye the sailor) me cuesta todavia ser un buen capitan pero lo estoy intentando de a poco, el juego es una aventura sub realista que merece muchisima mas atencion que la que la gente le ha dado.en la comunidad hay buena gente que se engancha y se lo toman muy en serio y quizas no tienen mucha paciencia con los nuevos y lo mandan a cubierta a a fregar el piso XD, pero sin dudas es un juego para apreciar en su totalidad por su originalidad unica, jugabilidad en equipo y su tematica steampunk hacen que te sumerjas en un mundo para dominar los cielos coloridos de guns of icarus !!!!A great game and if you like the simulation is 100% recommended anyone with pirate soul cant be lost this gameMy boat is called (Popeye the Sailor) still costs me to be a good captain, but I'm trying little by little, the game is a realistic sub realistic deserves far greater attention than it has given people.in the community are good people who are hooked and they take it very seriously and might not have much patience with new players and send it to scrub the floor XD aa, but certainly is a game to fully appreciate its originality , gameplay , teamwork and steampunk theme, make you dive into a world, where you can dominate colorful skies of Guns of Icarus!!!lo recomiendo como ganador en los premios steam			",129,14,7,7,24,2,9

												At the time of writing I have enjoyed my first 12 hours of the game. To give a bit of background, I prefer to play with friends rather than on my own or with random strangers in any game.Get one or two friends together and your sure to have a good time. You don't have to be able to shoot straight (unless you're a gunner) and you don't have to be an able pilot (unless you're playing pilot) thanks to the engineer class who is in charge of keeping the ship together, putting out and preventing fires, and buffing the weapons and engines to give an edge to the battle.AI crewmen are second rate compared to human players and I recommend that you get as many people together as possible before starting the match; this is where the game shows its negative side, it can take ages to get a match going as the smallest matches require 4 ships with at least 1 human captain each.The community has been nice thus far, aside from the odd♥♥♥♥♥♥measuring flame war, most players you meet are either dead silent or pleasant to talk with. The game comes with a wide variety of airships for different play styles, all of which are unlocked from the beginning (unless you are playing in ""novice matches""). Each ship can be equiped your own custom load out of guns, it is highly recommended that you (as designer) listen to your gunners request for which guns they want on it, otherwise you may alienate them.

												This game is fantastic, and I love what the developers are doing with it. Its constantly being updated, and is probably one of my favourite multiplayer games; it has got something for everyone. Love leading  a team into combat and supporting them by getting them in just the right position like myself? Play pilot. Rather shoot down enemies witha variety of guns and bullet buffs, darting from position to position and yelling at your captian for not getting into the right postion at the right time? Play gunner. And if you would prefer to get yelled by everyone while keeping the ship in the air and running around like a mad man, you would make the perfect engineer. While I know that my review involves a lot of yelling, the community is amazing and on that I'm proud to be a part of. Ignore the Metascore. This game is amazing. Allons-y!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game of Icarus this is one of the best game of 2017 i bought the same time with DLC, i also buy those 2 to my big brother... only i can say is Multipler/ COOP, 4 Players on a Ship 1 pilot 1 gunner and 2 engineer... damn even you got ping 200 ping - 400 ping the game still rock, those players using laptop like me am using low resulotion 1020x720, all disable, to remove those lag... !! this game required Team work and using your headphone with microphone to communicate to the crew... if you have abilities to lead a group try the CAPTAIN Aka Pilot! which we take the helm and command or sometimes he ask advise to his fellow crew... No good on pilot? Right Gunner is for you will focus on shooting the Airship, No good on piloting or gunner? SO engineer is your job focus on repairing everything, and keep them working at all times, removing fire on those engine, balloon and Hull.. >:D  there lots of skill there.. i still playing the Skimish mode aka PvP, if you dont feel playing those pro players why not PvE In Alliance Faction aka 5 faction to gain points for your faction to gain a land while fighting to those AI Ships,... battle for each other ...for point to conquer a land... this is the DLC the 5 faction... Chalado! for the Order!!Once again this game need team work, communication and strategy... for those starter play the tutorial hehehe >:D i give this game 9/10, some ship got glitch, for example in alliance war, boss ship just pass through us, also on those ship engine i fell while standing on a floor... this GAME is GOOD play it with your friends!!!

												-=Add Ageotas to your friendslist, and I am always happy to teach new people.=-Guns of Icarus may well be the most exciting and engaging game I have played. No other game places more focus on teamwork and cooperation, while maintaining a great atmosphere and hours of fun. The community is active, vocal, and happy to teach new players, and the Post Apocalyptic Airship theme is immensely refreshing and exciting.The attention to detail on the ships, the maps, and the player models is exquisite, and the soundtrack is subtle but engaging. The developers take a particularly active role, with constant updates, community feedback sessions, and they even regularly jump into the game and play along side you!Seriously, I cannot recommend this game enough, and I look forward to seeing more and more people take to the skies.

												Really innovative, fun and challenging game. My suggestion? Play with 3 other friends to get the most out of this game. When you do that, I promise you that it will be worth it. The only bad I have to say about this game is that the main menu layout gives too much info to the newbie and you can easily get lost on the menus. Also I would like the game to run a bit smoother sometimes. I have a pretty decent pc rig and at certain points the game lags for a second or so, but it doesn't ruin the whole experience so it's something minor. Overall great work devs, thank you for that game and keep updating the title.			",40,5,2,4,3,0,7

												This is very much a teamwork-based game.You are on a ship with 3 other people and all of you must work together to keep the ship running and in firing at enemies.  You also have 1-3 allied ships (each with their own crews) on your team.What this means is that you want to be playing this game with friends.  Ideally get a 4-pack and give 3 copies to your friends and then play with all four of you as the crew of a ship.  If you don’t have any friends to play with, then make some in game.  Joining a clan will help you develop a group of people that you can play with and that you know you can rely on.  I’m not going to go into too many details about the gameplay, but the rough overview is that you have one pilot who moves the ship and communicates with allied pilots.  You also have three other crewmembers that fire guns and repair components on the ship.  There are different ships, gun loadouts, ammo types, tool loadouts, etc. to choose from.Cosmetics can be purchased, but provide no gameplay advantages.The playerbase is usually small (a couple hundred people online at most), although in the aftermath of sales it can be much greater.  You have a generally friendly community and active devs, who you will often find in matches as well.Yeah, that about sums it up.  Also, prepare to spend lots of time in lobbies.			",78,5,0,3,11,0,8

												Guns of Icarus is an excellent Steampunk Airship tactical.Your crew must work as a team to achieve match objectives.Matches are always unpredictable, the strategy is evershifiting on the fly, and the feeling you get from taking an enemy ship down is exhillirating and addicting.This is definately a a game played well with friends.If you don't have many friends that play Guns of Icarus, there is a huge welcoming community; so go solo and have a great time!

												Guns of Icarus is good! (for a more in depth review see below)Guns of Icarus is a game heavily focused on teamwork. If you are not a team player, this game is not for you. However if you are looking for a great team orientated game with lots of features (including three similar yet somewhat different classes, ship and character customization, detailed maps and more) then this game is definitely for you!The graphics, although not the best, are still fairly good and the art style is something I haven't seen done right in a while. The gameplay itself is amazing, with a crew consisting of a pilot and three other players which can be either engineers or gunners. The objective of the game is to destroy your opponents ships whilst keeping yours in the air (good luck in doing that if you have a pilot who drives like a toddler behind a toy wheel). This simple objective makes for some amazing moments where sometimes you find yourself ganging up on some of your closest friends (you may find yourself screaming at them because they failed to fix the balloon in time or steer away from the big pointy rock...).Overall I believe that Guns of Icarus is a great game with massive potential. The only downside is the lack of interest in the game nowadays. Sometimes you find that it's really difficult to find an open game in your region which can obviously be a negative since this game is strictly an online multiplayer only game.I rate 8/10 for Guns of Icarus			",124,13,0,18,14,0,9

												Alright, so for my review.I am going to start with the visuals.So I am going to say that the ships themselves look really good. The textures for the walls, balloons, and guns and everything are really pretty nice. It has a very fun look to it. Sadly, look past the ship and be ready to see what apear to be giant mounds of fecal matter surrounded by gasios fog. The rocks, walls, buildings, and everything past your ship and other peoples ships look really lack luster, and it is really distracting from the otherwise nice apeal in of the ship.So now onto the actual gameplay.I am going to say this game is super fun to play. Like great fun. People over the voice chat are friendly and helpfull, the shooting mechanics are good, the controlls are snappy, it has a great mix of shooting, defense, and repairs and it is actually quite fun to jump around the airship fixing things and firing back at the enemy. While the in game transactions are a little anoying for a game that I payed for, they are mostly cosmetic and have little to no effect on the actual gameplay. The best in my opinion is the team death match, where you have two airships on your team and the equal amount on the other team, and you stratagise and team up to kill each other. It is great, and it can get really intense at some points. The best part of this game is when you get a group of friends on the same boat, and you can voice chat and stuff to comunicate enemy positions and directions. I have one gripe about the gameplay though.... And that is, a few of my friends on lower end rigs had some issues with clipping and some bad lag. This should not be the case with a meh looking game written in the unity engine.Difficulty: A lot of people in their reviews have pointed out that there can be a small learning curve when you first enter the game. I would agree with this, but I would also say that it is still fun when you are learning and it does not take long to get working like a well oilded machine.Overall, I would say this game is a load of fun if you can look past some poor textures and some poorly optimised gameplay. thesupergeek rates this a 12/10 for fun and a 8/10 for graphics. I will most likely play much more of this game over the summer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10 would Guns of Icarus again.This game is excellent on one hand because true co-operative gameplay, that captivates a community is rare to come across and this game has done this seemlessly. On the other hand the game provides dynamics that develop the strategy of the game, keeping players on thier toes  and  continues to draw them further into the game.If you are not a fan of pure pvp content, the new DLC Guns of Icarus: Alliance is coming out in the fall which from what ive heard is pure pve content.Games like this are like endangered animals, without support they could fall flat which would be a shame because of all the amazing potential the dev team has.

												How do you know a PvP game is good? You have fun losing. I have never had a bad time playing this game. It can be intense. The strategy is remarkably deep. Like any game where you play with strangers, you run into the occasional jerk but they are in the vast minority. The different roles and ships combine to make for a highly varied experience The matchmaking system seems to be about right on, producing close matches and nail-biting conclusions. Best team PvP game since Quake Wars.And important stuff about actual gameplay aside, it's pretty too. The whole steampunk Zeppelin fighting thing is absurd but it's just far enough out to let you gloss over things like how hull-armor is a machine you repair but not so far out that if feels silly or arbitrary like if it was some kind of magic spell you were maintaining.I cannot more strongly reccomend playing.

												This is a really good game. All three of the different classes are equally fun to play, and are all extremely important to the team. There are only two ways I can think of to improve the game. 1. A few new types of guns to put on your ship. 2. Improved AI (seriously, the AI gunners have terrible aim, and the pilots can barely fly the ship.). Other than that,this is an amazing game and is definitley worth the $15.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so much fun to play. There are several classes you can play as; engi, gunner and pilot or captain class. Gunners are obviously responsible for shooting the enemies, destorying parts on their ships, and ultimately their goal is to kill them. There are many different guns and ammo types. Of course, for different gun different ammo is needed because it works in the gun better and is more effective at destorying the enemy. Typically your captain will suggest ammo but you may want to ask them what they want. OH, and always check the captains ship load out so you can see what guns are on there and if you already know what ammo works best equip it and double check with captain. Engis are like the glue of the whole airship, they are responsible for rebuilding parts on ship that have been destroyed, restoring health to damaged ship parts, and putting out fires, buffing equipment etc. The captain is the ships ""brains"", they steer the ship, use their captain tools to make the ship go faster, higher etc. Its loads of fun to play with your friends because it is an online mutliplayer you are always playing with people, making new friends. It also has clans that you can join and become part of their extended family and things. Its quite fun and i'd recommended any one buy it when it is onsale, seeing as its a good use of money and can be played for hours on end. I'd also recommend doing the tutorial b/c ppl get mad at new players often for just jumping on into games especially when they don't listen to load out recommendations or seem to know what they are doing on the ship. Plus doing the tutorial gives you a better understand of the classes and their specific roles on the ship.			",163,47,3,25,14,3,12

												Not necessarily a game for everyone but I am personally a sucker for these sorts of teamwork games and have been wanting a game where you play as a single crewman on a ship as a multiplayer concept for a while. I was thinking tallship more then airship but no complaints here. The gameplay is simple but I find there is a good deal of strategic depth here with positioning, gun/ship matchups, and time management to keep things engaging. With a weak captain the game can feel pretty bland, but when you have a good talkative crew with plans and a leader suddenly you're playing a completely different game and it has a great feel to it. So far the community has had a really nice air to it and I've been having a ton of fun.On the downside bugs still crop up here and there. Nothing I haven't been able to fix by restarting the client but needing to do so mid match because I couldn't access my tools or use guns was frustrating. Hopefully that sort of thing will get patched up as the game moves forward.The game could end up feeling slow and for some classes you can find yourself behaving fairly mindlessly in your task which could result in finding things boring which is why I mentioned it may not be for everyone. I find that my investment in what is happening on the larger scope keeps me engaged even when I'm just staring out into a dustcloud waiting for the pilot to bring us around but that investment is largely created by the community and having a nice bunch in your crew. I've had some silent rides where I started to feel managing certain guns or covering certain areas as an engineer becoming monotonous. Though with a lively crew this never even occured to me.All in all, I've been having an absolute blast with it. If you like teamwork orientated games and feel you can be invested in a team outcome as much as personal activity you should have a great time here, though a mic is basically a must so do make sure you have one. If your unsure I would lean towards advising you give it a shot as it is a fairly unique sort of game. Even if you grow tired of it eventually I think you'll still find yourself with a good set of fond memories. Sometimes hunting for a good crew can take a bit but hop around and try to chat with people and see what you can find. If your having no luck try and find a Community Ambassador. They've all been great in my experience for getting fun matches rolling.			",113,14,0,36,12,3,38

												For an indie game, this game is DEFINITELY WORTH the asking price! The game takes a bold direction by putting players in flying airships in a fancy steampunk- themed world. Teamwork is essential here, as you and three other players, each playing one of 3 different roles: Gunner, Engineer, and Pilot...must work together in order to ensure a decisive victory over your opponents in the skies! Gameplay is fun, addictive, and well- balanced (for the most part). A fresh change of pace from your typical team- based pvp game. It's just such a shame this game isn't more well- known....Highly recommend playing this game with a group of friends.			",98,9,0,21,8,0,13

												This game is rather fun when you have a team that actually takes it seriously to a point where it doesn't involve death threats and calling names.  It has a very interesting style to it, which I enjoy.  The main key in this game, however, is how you use teamwork to crush the enemy team.  Only problem is, sometimes you would find the team that uses no communication or teamwork what so ever, and this eventually causes you terrible death and losing streak.   There aren't really a lot of people out in this game to provide such cooperation, but I've managed to find a few diamonds in the rough.  But as always, all games aren't perfect.Overall, it is a very nice and engaging game once you get the mechanics of it, which isn't too hard.  It's nice to steer away from all of the other first person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield, since this adds a new twist to it.  I would recommend trying to team up with your buddies and online friends if you really want to do any good.  Pros:-Addicting-Uses Cooperation and teamwork for key point-Isn't very hard (Once you get used to it, of course)-Great fun with friends-Very intense at timesCons:-Sometimes buggy-Hard to find many players that use the teamwork			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On one hand this game is adictive, tactical and is great fun with a group of friends. And on the other; it's a glitchy mess with a below average menu interface. At full price I would say to stay clear of this game, it has way to many faults to justify it. On sale... if you can tolerate falling though floors, glitching randomly out of the map, lag and the occasional game crash then this game is certainly worth playing.			",342,78,10,47,21,3,35

												The feel and thrill you get when engaging in ship to ship combat and having to rely not only on your personal skills but on your own crew mates' as well is something you don't usually find in gaming.This is a game about cooperation and communication in a way that ""realistic"" war games fall short miles from.It is the most rewarding online experience I've had in years. Unique gameplay experience. Keeping me at the edge of my seat in a way I haven't seen in ages.Picture a stylish steampunk balloon under enemy fire: the Engineers are running around putting out fires and frantically fixing components, barely keeping up with the mounting damage; the Gunners are trying to return the damage they are taking with interest and maybe neutralize the enemies' guns and vital components to give themselves better odds before their own guns are taken out; the Captain is flying a ship with half the engines blown, the best gun out of commission and the balloon about to burst has to decide whether he can attempt to make a run for it or if it is better to bring all guns to bear and go down in a blaze of glory.

												This game is insanely fun! (besides waiting for a match) And being the pilot from my opinion is the best part of the game because who dosent want to ram a giant steampunk airship into another steampunk airship?! Being the pilot is fun espeacially not even being in battle. The gunner is basically the guy who repairs the guns and the guy who uses them most of the time. The guy who works on the ship and i didnt forget the name of it, yeah i did, but i kind of find this part kinda hard because one second your firing a gun the next second your having to repair the whole entire ship within 3 sec. without getting fully shot down. This game is amazing i wish i found this game a lot sooner			",40,8,0,3,10,2,3

												This game is great! The gameplay is smooth, and the mechanics are fun! This game deserves a much larger player base. This is the game to get to play with friends, or if you just want duke it out, steampunk airship style!Adding: I have put a alot more time into this game, and have learned a lot more. This game is heavily team based, whether it be your crew or elsewise. If you love that kind of game, 10/10 reccomend.Adding more: The newest update which added VIP makes the game feel like its 2014 again, with all the fresh faces and strats around. I'm not a fan of VIP, but the game has come so far since when i picked it up long ago.			",33,5,0,2,5,0,0

Whether you need to have the ship turn to fire a gun, spotting the enemy while repairing the hull and engines, or plain steering through chaos, communication is essential to your survival.No team, no victory.

												YARRRR ME HEARTIESThis game is amazing and addictive... but what'd you expect from a steampunk-like airship combat simulator, tactically blowing your enemies to smithereens? The game's all about teamwork, enhancing and requiring a lot of contact between a ship's crew, which makes the game an amazing thing to play, and usually ends up being very socially cosy and enjoyable, and often gives you your daily healthy dose of rage. The community so far is great, too!An important point to bring forward to this game is that in order to play correctly and efficiently, you WILL need a microphone. The developers have alternatives such as voice commands, which helps, but for the most fluent and efficient communications, one should use microphone communications. The microphone recording/playback quality in-game are very fast and good enough to understand each other clearly.The game is well-populated and features an unique experience system through earning achievements. This encourages variety in your playstyle in order to discover what suits you and your crew most. Did I mention hats yet? Everybody likes hats. Especially if most of the cool hats and paint dyes are unlockable through gaining achievements anyway! Apart from the unavoidable bugs every now and then, the game's graphics are neatly done and the UI is very accessible and easy to get the hang of. The music is repetitive but cool, and the gameplay is astonishing. The 3 different classes give the player an opportunity to play as they like. Extremely roughly said: for constant focus on dodging and tactically positioning the ship, as well as laying traps and ramming into others without being able to maintain the ship itself, choose Pilot. For routine maintaining the ship under heavy pressure, repairing and rebuilding, as well as shooting every now and then, go Engineer. For pure shooting with special ammo and helping out with repairs every now and then, take Gunner. There's usually room on a ship for 1 Pilot, 2 Engineers and 1 Gunner. At least, that is most likely the most beneficial option.Once you go Guns of Icarus, ya can't stop, so get it now, I recommend it to everyone with a sense for action-packed fun, cooperation and enjoyment.

												Guns of Icarus Online is an absolutely spectacular game, certainly worth the price (especially if you and three friends all pool your money and get the 4-pack). Given that ship crews are four people strong (captain, engineer and two gunners in my group) this works out well.For an online-only game, and in absolute terms, the community is fantastic - never once have I encountered a rude player and novices actually get a chance to learn the game rather than be bullied out by the more-experienced players (looking at you, LoL).Feature-wise, the game is very dependant on teamwork, no single ship is overpowered and there are many different weapon loadouts for each given ship, making spotting and target identification a must-have skill. Each player can take five items of equipment (one sailing tool, one engineering tool, one gunnery tool; plus two extras for their chosen class), which allows for even more customisation in fighting style. The levelling system is strange but it works - achievements count towards levels, with so many achievements being needed to level up. Crucially for an online-only game, there is absolutely no pay-to-win.The game looks amazing, there's no doubt about that. Everything is beautifully rendered and designed. The soundtrack and in-game SFX are also incredible.The only downside I can think of is that if the game lags, it can have a severe impact on the entire crew's effectiveness, especially if the Captain is the one with the lag issues.

												This game is good.The community I believe, is the best part of it; almost all the players are friendly and welcoming. Out of the hundreds of matches I've been in I've only experienced one rather unpleasant individual. The gameplay is incredibly fun, there is a depth to the countless strategies and ways to play the game that are really great. Ship customization allows you to make really interesting builds, you can have a fast sniping ship or a tanky ship with heavy guns. This is one of the few games I always come back to play, it's totally worth it!Pros:+ Fun, intense gameplay+ Incredibly friendly community+ Countless ways to play and strategize+ Great visuals+ Constant new updates + Lots of fun with friendsCons:+ At times can get repetitive+ The matchmaking lobbies drag on forever. A recent update sped it up a bit, but it still takes a good 10-15 minutes to start a match!			",111,21,6,14,13,0,13

The learning curve is there, there is customisation on character looks, loadout, and ships, also several roles to play as.

												This game requires a lot of cooperation between not only other ships, but also each individual crew member. Each player has a vital role to the operation of the ship and the survival of the ship relies on the performance of it's crew. This is a fantastic game to play with friends, and also has a brilliant community that is (usually) very easy to get along with. Though it can be frustrating at times, especially when playing with people you don't know, this game is very addicting and overall entertaining. Not to mention that despite the usual lower player count, it is very easy to find a server, and relatively easy to make friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No good on pilot? Right Gunner is for you will focus on shooting the Airship, No good on piloting or gunner? SO engineer is your job focus on repairing everything, and keep them working at all times, removing fire on those engine, balloon and Hull.. >:D  there lots of skill there.. i still playing the Skimish mode aka PvP, if you dont feel playing those pro players why not PvE In Alliance Faction aka 5 faction to gain points for your faction to gain a land while fighting to those AI Ships,... battle for each other ...for point to conquer a land... this is the DLC the 5 faction... Chalado! for the Order!!Once again this game need team work, communication and strategy... for those starter play the tutorial hehehe >:D i give this game 9/10, some ship got glitch, for example in alliance war, boss ship just pass through us, also on those ship engine i fell while standing on a floor... this GAME is GOOD play it with your friends!!!

												This game is rather fun when you have a team that actually takes it seriously to a point where it doesn't involve death threats and calling names.  It has a very interesting style to it, which I enjoy.  The main key in this game, however, is how you use teamwork to crush the enemy team.  Only problem is, sometimes you would find the team that uses no communication or teamwork what so ever, and this eventually causes you terrible death and losing streak.   There aren't really a lot of people out in this game to provide such cooperation, but I've managed to find a few diamonds in the rough.  But as always, all games aren't perfect.Overall, it is a very nice and engaging game once you get the mechanics of it, which isn't too hard.  It's nice to steer away from all of the other first person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield, since this adds a new twist to it.  I would recommend trying to team up with your buddies and online friends if you really want to do any good.  Pros:-Addicting-Uses Cooperation and teamwork for key point-Isn't very hard (Once you get used to it, of course)-Great fun with friends-Very intense at timesCons:-Sometimes buggy-Hard to find many players that use the teamwork			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lots of high flying steam punk fun.Pilot a battle blimp, fire the main cannons, or keep the tub in the air with your trusty rubber mallet, every role is important and each air ship requires a different strategy.There is no P2W that you might expect in a lobby based game, the only thing money will buy you is a bit of bling for your character or ship.Not to mention the Unity engine provides a wonderful environment with great visual effects and it is all topped off with a very fitting sound track.I do indeed recommend this game, just beware the Goldfish.

												I absolutely love this game. The PvP is amazing, requires teamwork, and communication. There's no instant win, there's no uncounterable things, and unlike a lot of PvP games, the community is actually really nice and helpful. With Alliance (PvE mode) coming out in a few months, there's no reason not to buy this game. Who doesn't enjoy steampunk airship combat? Nobody, that's who :3			",248,28,2,24,19,1,25

												Awsome game to play with friends.It is a buggy game but they fix and update weekly (if not daily) so dont worry much about that.You will surely enjoy playing with 3 friends on the same air ship, but I must say that if you dont have friends who play Guns of Icarus, it might be boring after a few hours.

We were immediately drawn to the game because of its gorgeous Steampunk art style, mostly because of the Steampunk themed Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I was taking part in with my friends.

Being able to fly your own airship across an area and fight other ships is satisfying, relaxing, and adventurous.The main reason why I wanted to write this review was not because of the 15k review milestone, but also to express how great the staff is. When I purchased the game, I immediately decided to purchase outfits for my characters. I soon discovered I made an accidental purchase and requested a refund. Never have I met such fast support before in a game. I was emailed very shortly after I sent my refund request and the staff kindly understood and gave me a quick refund with no real hassle at all.The game is great and the community itself in not only the players, but the staff as well.If you have any friends, get everyone you know to buy this game and command your own airship together.

												GoIO is quite the unique game, with a mostly fantastic community, and an always active and open Dev team. the game is deceptivly simple at first, but as you play you realise how deep and teamwork oriented everything is. i also love that the game caters to pretty much every possible play style in a ship to ship combat game, want to rush in and ram things to splinters? you can do it, want to run in, pop a ballon or set some fires and run away to safety? check, want to play it safe and snipe from across the map, you can do that too. you can even just launch a bunch of mines and try to trick the enemy into flying into them. anything and everything can be effective as long as you have good teamwork, and with a surprisingly civil community thats not a problem.

Great community that is very helpful with newcomers, plenty of patient people that make getting into the game a very pleasant experience. Best played with a mic (especially if you're piloting) as efficient communication is key in this game. Sealed lips sink ships... they're not kidding!

												Guns of Icarus is a great airship combat game with a focus on teamwork. A very sharp focus as well, without teamwork the game is nearly unplayable. If you can grab this game with a few friends, it will work very well. If your friends don't want to play it, Guns of Icarus is still good because the community is good and willing to teach anyone who wants to learn.Overall, as well as you are ok with teamwork, it is worth a shot.

It's super fun and the community of players is one of the nicest around.   Bonus:  Super dedicated development team who continue to raise the bar for all other indie teams out there.

												Guns of Icarus Online has a wonderful teamwork aspect to it in which most other games don't really provide. Most games have a certain objective and then everyone can go off and do their own thing. With this game, you all have to work together and provide key communication in order to own the skies and take the victory.The game's graphics may not be as high as big brand games, but they sure are detailed enough to get the point across. The engine performs amazingly and I have had no trouble whatsoever in figuring out how to play. The controls are put up on screen (providing you kept the tips on) so that even the most novice of players can get a grip for the controls.Customization is also very big in this game. Not only can you customize your character's appearance, but you can customize your ship down to the last weapon. Want a flamethrower on your vessel? Go right ahead! The game already has a large selection of weapons for you to use so go ahead and use them!All in all this game is great and it really does show in the dynamic of its performance, quality, and playability. The easy controls, stunning design, and almost limitless customization makes this game perfect for those who seek action, and great team playing.			",90,33,6,5,35,2,6

Posted: June 25, 2014
												This is one of the most lovingly well-crafted games I have ever seen. There is something about the way that the developers balance all of the components, from time-management, to customization, to sheer fighting force, that it creates an environment which fosters amazing teamwork and sportsmanship. In addition, it also makes for the nicest community of any game I've played.Graphics 9/10While the graphics aren't quite as photo-realistic as some of the big name games out there (CoD, Halo, etc…) they are beautifully crafted, and present a rough and rugged steampunk setting. The ships themselves are detailed and full of moving parts, which serve as a reminder that you aren't on just some video-game ship, but a real piece of machinery. The landscapes, too, are stunning, and though up close, the textures are slightly lacking, when you are mid air, it makes for some amazing vistas. The combination of sublime natural beauty and post-apocalyptic destruction is successful. In particular, I am fond of the WWII era battleship half-sunk in the sand of Battle on the Dunes, and the wreckage of an airship skeleton on Duel at Dawn.Story 8/10 (tentative)Well, since there isn't a real storyline as of yet, this rating is a little based on potential I see, but from the meta-game material I've seen, the introductions shown on each map, and the imminent advent of adventure mode, I am very excited for how the story will develop. From the hints, though, things are looking pretty cool.Music 8/10The music in this game is well-crafted, if not quite as creative or actual-music-y as the soundtrack of Bastion, per se, but what they do have, is a soundtrack that modulates based on play. When you spawn, there is no music, but as you near other ships, ominous drums begin to play, followed by flutes playing war cries, then more and more of the orchestra come in as the battle intensifies. This lends a great tension to the game, and makes for a very satisfying battle experience.Gameplay 10/10There is nothing that I can really fault the gameplay for at large. Sometimes glitches creep in, but the devs are very good about fixing them. In terms of genre, it's hard to say where to place this. It really depends on your class. There are three classes: The Pilot, The Engineer, and The Gunner. When you are playing with the pilot, the game plays like a dogfighter, only a little slower, since you're flying a ship rather than a plane (Though planes are in the works, apparently). This is not to say that it is boring. On the contrary, the 3D movement is very fluid, and competent captains can pull off some pretty amazing moves. Also, there are a variety of piloting tools to allow your ship to perform better. As engineer, you are playing a time management game, combined with a bit of fps, and a bit of parkour. You have to keep all the components repaired, but also might need to do daring jumps around the ship to get to them fast enough. Instead of boring time-management, though, there is always a great deal of excitement as the engineer, since the tension of the battle spices things up, and you need to negotiate with your crew. As Gunner, you're playing a turret-based fps, with some time management. The guns are very satisfying, and aiming is a good challenge, especially with arcing mortars or sniper rifles. However, where this game really shines is the crew and team cooperation. The captain commands his crew, but the crew also has to negotiate themselves and make sure that the ship is in tip-top shape (and the enemies aren't). Quite often, there is a quick friendship formed between the crew and captain, and a banter on the ship is not uncommon. Furthermore, there is another layer of teamwork as the captain must team up with the other ships on his team. The voice chat is very smooth, and it is highly recommended, since communication is critical.Community 10/10The learning curve on this game is a little steep, but luckily (unless you fail to communicate at all), you will be helped out by higher level players. Most level 15's are happy to play with level 1's and will give them commands to help them learn. It's very rare that you meet a troll, and the community usually snuffs them out with the power of friendship and love. The lobbies are usually lively, and conversations between games are usually off-topic and fun. However, people who want to play seriously will do so, but still with a sense of fun. Furthermore, there are frequent tournaments and player hosted events like ship racing. One of the best parts, however, is the dev involvement. There are devs on almost every day, and most players have a chance to play with them. When you send an email, they respond within hours, usually, and will not hesitate to post in every steam discussion. Balance 10/10This game is not pay-to-win, which is awesome. You can buy things, but they are only cosmetic, and very cheap, so nobody is ever ahead by money. Better still, when you level, you don't unlock new weapons, which would give high level players an even higher advantage. You do unlock cool costumes, and badges, though, which is more than fair compensation. All of the ships are equal, and nothing is really OP in the game, so really, the team with the best strategy and teamwork wins, not the higher level players with more money.Overall 10/10The reviews gave this game a bad rep, because of its glitchiness in the beta. DO NOT BELIEVE METACRITIC. Those are early reviews of and early version. If the reviews reflected the current version, they would be far higher. Honestly, I think this is a game for everybody. Get it while it's on sale if you can, but it's well worth the $15. It's definitely better with friends, though, so if you can, get a 4-pack and play with your friends as crew. There is no reason for this not to be the top team-based game in the world. Buy it now, and make the awesome community even awesomer.			",112,66,0,5,10,4,18

												This game is cray cray good. Steampunk mixed with ships mixed with dogfights mixed with epic beards mixed with fire and destruction. -While engineer may be seen as the ♥♥♥♥♥ job, the ship's health is basically relying on the engineer's skill (which is why team usually have two).-Captain takes some time to get used to, but is fairly simple after some coaching.-Gunner can be seen as a noob position but it is probably the most fun. At times it is almost a spray-and-pray position, but there is some strategy involved depending on if you have a good captain.Overall, a very entertaining game.			",578,124,14,66,60,7,91

I was emailed very shortly after I sent my refund request and the staff kindly understood and gave me a quick refund with no real hassle at all.The game is great and the community itself in not only the players, but the staff as well.If you have any friends, get everyone you know to buy this game and command your own airship together.

												GoIO is quite the unique game, with a mostly fantastic community, and an always active and open Dev team. the game is deceptivly simple at first, but as you play you realise how deep and teamwork oriented everything is. i also love that the game caters to pretty much every possible play style in a ship to ship combat game, want to rush in and ram things to splinters? you can do it, want to run in, pop a ballon or set some fires and run away to safety? check, want to play it safe and snipe from across the map, you can do that too. you can even just launch a bunch of mines and try to trick the enemy into flying into them. anything and everything can be effective as long as you have good teamwork, and with a surprisingly civil community thats not a problem.

												Edited 04.02.2017Steampunk-Airship-Dogfighting. Teams of four players per ship, customizeable zeppelins and characters, there´s nothing alike and it is, at least in my opinion, worth the full price, which isn´t that high to begin with anyway. Now with PvE, clan wars, more ships, guns, customisation options friendly devs and a while small, very friendly and good community, this game deserves more attention. The only thing it suffers from is the quite small playerbase and the rather high skill-ceiling which can lead to very hard matches due to the small but experienced playerbase. Bring friends and be prepared to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you every now and then. 9/10 it´s fun, get it now or on sale with the DLC´s, best get the 4-pack and bring your friends for enjoyable, tactical airship battles.

												Love it. Love the style, good community, clan warfare and active developers that you can easily get a hold of, graphics isn't great but that's not a problem to me.Love the animations that take place on the airship (reloading guns, repairing etc.) but I don't think the game is too well known and more people should try it out.It's a good team based PvP game, although it's a little unstable so some connection and graphics issues are possible. Communication with your team is key, but it's a really fun game to play with friends.I'd rate it an 8-9/10, got this game three days ago and I've played over 24 hours already, it's just too good to put down in my opinion.

												At the time of writing I have enjoyed my first 12 hours of the game. To give a bit of background, I prefer to play with friends rather than on my own or with random strangers in any game.Get one or two friends together and your sure to have a good time. You don't have to be able to shoot straight (unless you're a gunner) and you don't have to be an able pilot (unless you're playing pilot) thanks to the engineer class who is in charge of keeping the ship together, putting out and preventing fires, and buffing the weapons and engines to give an edge to the battle.AI crewmen are second rate compared to human players and I recommend that you get as many people together as possible before starting the match; this is where the game shows its negative side, it can take ages to get a match going as the smallest matches require 4 ships with at least 1 human captain each.The community has been nice thus far, aside from the odd♥♥♥♥♥♥measuring flame war, most players you meet are either dead silent or pleasant to talk with. The game comes with a wide variety of airships for different play styles, all of which are unlocked from the beginning (unless you are playing in ""novice matches""). Each ship can be equiped your own custom load out of guns, it is highly recommended that you (as designer) listen to your gunners request for which guns they want on it, otherwise you may alienate them.

												Un gran juego y si te gusta la simulacion es super recomendado nadie que tenga alma de pirata puede perderse este juego mi barco se llama popeye el marino (popeye the sailor) me cuesta todavia ser un buen capitan pero lo estoy intentando de a poco, el juego es una aventura sub realista que merece muchisima mas atencion que la que la gente le ha dado.en la comunidad hay buena gente que se engancha y se lo toman muy en serio y quizas no tienen mucha paciencia con los nuevos y lo mandan a cubierta a a fregar el piso XD, pero sin dudas es un juego para apreciar en su totalidad por su originalidad unica, jugabilidad en equipo y su tematica steampunk hacen que te sumerjas en un mundo para dominar los cielos coloridos de guns of icarus !!!!A great game and if you like the simulation is 100% recommended anyone with pirate soul cant be lost this gameMy boat is called (Popeye the Sailor) still costs me to be a good captain, but I'm trying little by little, the game is a realistic sub realistic deserves far greater attention than it has given people.in the community are good people who are hooked and they take it very seriously and might not have much patience with new players and send it to scrub the floor XD aa, but certainly is a game to fully appreciate its originality , gameplay , teamwork and steampunk theme, make you dive into a world, where you can dominate colorful skies of Guns of Icarus!!!lo recomiendo como ganador en los premios steam			",129,14,7,7,24,2,9

												Some of the most fun I've had in a multiplayer in a while. It's a very unique game. There are three roles. Gunner, engineer, and pilot. Pilot flies the ship, engineer repairs the ship, gunner attacks the enemies. There's a heavy emphasis on playing as a team. If one person is bad then it can bring the team down. Each class has unique tools and abilities they can use to help win. The goal is to destroy the enemy ships. Ships are customized by the pilot and there are different types with many different weapon to choose from. Overall, it's a ton of fun. Get it.			",165,22,0,24,12,0,30

												An incredible example of independent development gone right. Guns of Icarus Online is a team based dieselpunk WAR ZEPPELIN combat game, in which players can assume one of three basic roles in order to support their team. The competitive scene is community driven and detail  oriented, providing one of the most rewarding competitive scenes out there. Developers are directly and constantly involved with the community, and often draw upon community ideas to improve the game.Muse rocks, GoIO rocks.			",210,12,1,12,9,1,7

												I've wanted this game for a while now and I was finally able to purchase it with my friends when we found out the game was on sale last week.We instantly all fell in love with the game the moment we played it. We were immediately drawn to the game because of its gorgeous Steampunk art style, mostly because of the Steampunk themed Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I was taking part in with my friends. The game is gorgeous and creative when it comes to its design, and it fits the Steampunk style perfectly.The gameplay especially is very fun. Being able to fly your own airship across an area and fight other ships is satisfying, relaxing, and adventurous.The main reason why I wanted to write this review was not because of the 15k review milestone, but also to express how great the staff is. When I purchased the game, I immediately decided to purchase outfits for my characters. I soon discovered I made an accidental purchase and requested a refund. Never have I met such fast support before in a game. I was emailed very shortly after I sent my refund request and the staff kindly understood and gave me a quick refund with no real hassle at all.The game is great and the community itself in not only the players, but the staff as well.If you have any friends, get everyone you know to buy this game and command your own airship together.

												YARRRR ME HEARTIESThis game is amazing and addictive... but what'd you expect from a steampunk-like airship combat simulator, tactically blowing your enemies to smithereens? The game's all about teamwork, enhancing and requiring a lot of contact between a ship's crew, which makes the game an amazing thing to play, and usually ends up being very socially cosy and enjoyable, and often gives you your daily healthy dose of rage. The community so far is great, too!An important point to bring forward to this game is that in order to play correctly and efficiently, you WILL need a microphone. The developers have alternatives such as voice commands, which helps, but for the most fluent and efficient communications, one should use microphone communications. The microphone recording/playback quality in-game are very fast and good enough to understand each other clearly.The game is well-populated and features an unique experience system through earning achievements. This encourages variety in your playstyle in order to discover what suits you and your crew most. Did I mention hats yet? Everybody likes hats. Especially if most of the cool hats and paint dyes are unlockable through gaining achievements anyway! Apart from the unavoidable bugs every now and then, the game's graphics are neatly done and the UI is very accessible and easy to get the hang of. The music is repetitive but cool, and the gameplay is astonishing. The 3 different classes give the player an opportunity to play as they like. Extremely roughly said: for constant focus on dodging and tactically positioning the ship, as well as laying traps and ramming into others without being able to maintain the ship itself, choose Pilot. For routine maintaining the ship under heavy pressure, repairing and rebuilding, as well as shooting every now and then, go Engineer. For pure shooting with special ammo and helping out with repairs every now and then, take Gunner. There's usually room on a ship for 1 Pilot, 2 Engineers and 1 Gunner. At least, that is most likely the most beneficial option.Once you go Guns of Icarus, ya can't stop, so get it now, I recommend it to everyone with a sense for action-packed fun, cooperation and enjoyment.

												Guns of Icarus Online - Now there's a unique, little game. Set in a steampunky universe, you and three friends/randoms/AIs man a heavily armed airship through treacherous cliffsides or dusty dunes and engage the enemies 1-4 ships at range or in tight dogfights. The arsenal of weapons is decent, with new ones added through patches. A few different ships allow you to play the game like you want it - as a fast, harassing mosquito or as a well-armed and armoured battleship. As with weapons, new ships have been announced and will probably be added eventually. As far as customisation goes, currently you can only modify the character you play as, give him/her a nice outfit, a hat and accessories. According to the devs there will even be a sort-of open world aspect in the near future, allowing you to play as a merchant, pirate or mercenary. Even now, though, the game is definitely worth checking out if you want something that stands out. Heaps of fun with some buddies!			",218,34,4,40,54,1,46

												This game is good.The community I believe, is the best part of it; almost all the players are friendly and welcoming. Out of the hundreds of matches I've been in I've only experienced one rather unpleasant individual. The gameplay is incredibly fun, there is a depth to the countless strategies and ways to play the game that are really great. Ship customization allows you to make really interesting builds, you can have a fast sniping ship or a tanky ship with heavy guns. This is one of the few games I always come back to play, it's totally worth it!Pros:+ Fun, intense gameplay+ Incredibly friendly community+ Countless ways to play and strategize+ Great visuals+ Constant new updates + Lots of fun with friendsCons:+ At times can get repetitive+ The matchmaking lobbies drag on forever. A recent update sped it up a bit, but it still takes a good 10-15 minutes to start a match!			",111,21,6,14,13,0,13

												For an indie game, this game is DEFINITELY WORTH the asking price! The game takes a bold direction by putting players in flying airships in a fancy steampunk- themed world. Teamwork is essential here, as you and three other players, each playing one of 3 different roles: Gunner, Engineer, and Pilot...must work together in order to ensure a decisive victory over your opponents in the skies! Gameplay is fun, addictive, and well- balanced (for the most part). A fresh change of pace from your typical team- based pvp game. It's just such a shame this game isn't more well- known....Highly recommend playing this game with a group of friends.			",98,9,0,21,8,0,13

												Please, if you're even slightly interested in this game, stick with me to the end.At first, I was turned off of this game. The in-game cosmetic microtransactions in a paid game, and a couple of friends' opinions of it did not sell it for me. But, when another friend of mine gave me the game so that I could crew on his ships, and I gave it another look...I found my new favorite game.The developers have put in a lot of time, effort, and love into their creation and their community. They're quite involved with the people that play their game, and many if not all of them play their game every chance they get, twice a week.The in-game cosmetic store, let me say, is optional. Nothing you buy will affect your gameplay...AND, any piece in the store can be earned for free in dev matches, hosted Tuesdays and Thursdays, if you're feeling particularly frugal.About the game itself, think of it as ""3D naval battles"" against other teams of people. Each crew of four works together to man a ship, which is chosen by the captain. Each ship flies differently, and uses different tactics and strategies to be effective. The most important aspects to winning this game are, in my opinion, communication, morale, and teamwork, in that order. Everything else is gravy.Guns of Icarus: Online is seriously underrated, and I hope that everyone gives it a chance. But I must say, it's even better if you have someone to fly with. Bring a friend or two, and you won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For what this game is, it's incredibly balanced and has the perfect sized community. You'll find yourself traveling along slowly, but there will always be something for everyone on your crew to be doing productively. The strategy gets extremely deep with ship customization and you can easily struggle to keep up as a new player. Do not do pilot as one. Also, if you have lag you're doomed and your crew is going to yell at you. It happens. However, if you're a strategist fine with frustration coming mainly out of non-addiction and a limited amount of ship kills, this game is for you.			",91,8,2,5,3,0,4

												This game sorta creeped up on me outta nowhere. Didn't think much of it at first glance but once i hopped on in i was surprised the game is alot more challenging and way more fun then i had first thought. If you're a big fan of steampunk type games, shooters, airship battles, teamplay etc etc you will love this game. Teamwork is a must if you are to play if you dont have that you will lose intrest very fast, so i recommend this game to everyone who enjoys air battles and teamwork as much as i.			",18,0,0,3,2,0,9

												This game has alot og potential to be better. Muse game is a small production team that dreams big.This game is really fun as air ship goes head to head with each other. The elevation and environment plays a part as player get to fly thru ruined buildings or harsh deserts trying to destroy the other team ship. However, the incentive to continue playing is thru achievements. Also, after awhile this game can be repetitive. If you like ships of varied design and battling just for the fun of it. This is the game for you.I really like this game. As it just takes to the action without much story or reason.			",112,34,4,11,12,0,29

												Guns of Icarus has a very unique concept. And the execution is nearly perfectlyYou got 4 guys per ship doing different things. (Usually 1 Pilot, 2 People using the Guns and 1 person focused on repairing.) The Persons themself are unkilable, only the ship is.There are 3 Game Modes: Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill and Crazy King.Then there are 3 classes to choose from. Each of em has it´s own purpose with it´s own tools.But the by far most important and most positive aspect of this Game is the community!!!This community is the direct opposite to CoD or CS:GO.It is really small with only around 400 (getting up to 6000 players during sales)  people at a time, but thats a good thing and this Game is definitely NOT DEAD.You start recognizing people, make friends really quickly and learn the baiscs and advanced stuff pretty fast.U can customize a lot of stuff in this game. Your look (cosmetics available through microtransactions, but no benefitial stuff), Your Ship, the Guns u have on it, what ammo u wanna use for em, you can pick stuff like kerosine to fly faster or a chute vent to decrease altitude really quickly as a pilot.This game is really atmospheric aswell. You got all sorts of Maps from dunes to ruined cities to snowy mountains and a frozen ocean. The music is awesome and really fitting.The combat is good aswell. You have different guns all made for different parts of the ship. U have a Gatling Gun t shred through the opponents armor, Flamethrowers to light things up, Carronades to destroy a ship´s Balloon. Or heavy guns like Flaks and Hwachas. Destroying a certain part of the ship has a certain effect. If your engines are destroyed you will have a hard time moving, if the Balloon is down you will descent until you hit the ground and die eventually.All of that stuff can be repaired again though.It is not everybodys Game though. Everybody cares his package and has his job. If you dont do it correctly chances are your ship wont get a single kill. The Engineers have to react quickly on broken parts, the Gunners should be percise and the Pilot should´nt hit every mountain on the map. Communication is key. If you see a ship, call it. If a part is destroyed, call it. If u need the guns armed at the port or starboard side, call it.A bad thing could be that because of the close-knitted community and the age of this game, there aren´t any Lobbies for new players. Before you reach level 8 with any class you will be able to play in so called novice matches. But there aren´t any so expect to get torn apart at your first game. But I would be suprised if your crew would be mad at you. Usually they are nice folks who will stay friendly and teach you a couple of things like what equipment is better or what ammo you should use for what gun.Another really awesome thing is the touch between the community and the developers. They join public matches, do Streams to talk to the players and even support events from bigger clans like the weekly Iron Fork from the Cake Clanon Fridays. They also do dev games where you can play against them and if you win you will get an Item for free.They are still actively supporting the game with patches, fixes and even an upcoming coop story mode, which sounds like it will have some unique concepts.Some people say that they quitted GoI because of a patch released some time ago. I bought this game after said patch and cannot make a statement about if it became worse or not. All I can say is that this Game is probably one of the best coop games out there and that you are missing out something if you dont give this game at least a shot.If I had to rate it I would give it a 9/10, probably a 10/10 as soon as the coop mode comes out. This game can be confusing for beginners, but as long as you communicate and you are willing to learn there should be nothing that can stop you and your crew from conquering the skies.

												This is a game. About pirate ships. That fly. And have large missile launchers, flamethrowers and a large assortment of other weapons. And you can shoot those. At other flying pirate ships. If that doesn't sound good to you, you clearly had no childhood.The idea of this game is to use your ariship to shoot down other airships. The core concept is very simple, and doesn't require Counter-Strike levels of aiming skill. However, don't let that fool you into thinking this game requires no skill. You still need to coordinate and compensate for movement on guns. The guns aren't hitscan like CS, which means you must compensate for projectile movement and lead your targets.There are 3 different roles:Pilot: Pilots the ship. Duh. Has several abilities to change ship functions, such as adding speed. Most of these damage some ship component.Engineer: Fixes anything that breaks/explodes. Can use fire extinguishers, and wield more than one repair tool. You can have 3 at one time, allowing you to adapt your fixing method depending on how many parts have exploded/lit on fire.Gunner: Holds different types of ammo that allows him to adapt to different situations. Need more fire? Got it. Need faster bullets? Sure!Each of these roles must work together in a crew of four to destroy enemy ships. The built in voice chat is excellent, providing you a great way to work together with teammates. If you don't have a mic, don't play this game. You won't enjoy it. The teamwork itself is quite satisfying(10 DEGREES TO PORT, CAPN! GET THAT HULL BACK UP, ENGIE!), and this is the part of the game that I enjoy the most. The multiplayer has a commendation system built in, as well as a report system. Most of the community is very friendly, and the salty ones get weeded out quickly.As for the variety, everything is unlocked from the start, meaning you can use every ship in the game(provided you're willing to get wrecked your first few games with large ships). Every gun on these ships is replaceable, allowing you to create your own loadouts suited for every situation. Sniper? Sure. Close range bruiser? You got it. Each crew member has a custom loadout that can be edited from the start as well.New to the game? Don't worry, there's a specific section of muiltiplayer dedicated to level 10 or below players. This limits the ships you can use to some simpler ones to get you used to the game. If you like, you can skip right into regular matchmaking.I highly recommend this game. The devs are great and still provide quality updates. I have no clue why people say this game is dead, there are 3K plus players online at any time. Filling lobbies is easy, getting everyone to ready up is the hard part. :P			",184,22,0,14,8,1,16

												Do you like working in a team? Do you like chaotic situations? Do you like shooting down airships? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you'll probably like Guns of Icarus Online. Piloting a ship requires close coordination between the pilot, engineers, and gunners to make sure you can down other ships without being destroyed yourselves. Communication with other ships on your team is vital. Matches usually go one of two ways: someone isn't listening and it all falls apart, or everyone works together and beautiful things happen. Winning in Guns of Icarus requires both skill and teamwork—and that's why I love it.(Note: I recieved this game as a gift from a friend, so I checked the ""recieved this for free"" box. I have had no direct contact with the developers, and this review is my opinion alone.)(P.S. If this review motivated you to purchase Guns of Icarus (or you just want a code to enter), use my referral code nPv5xw so we can both get some gifts ingame! Just click the Community button in the top left, then click Review and Recruit in the bottom right.

												Incredibly fun game. Airship combat featuring 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 team based gamemodes of Deathmatch and King of The Hill. Frequented by community ambassadors who will teach people anything they need to know, this game is easy to learn but hard to master. Always being updated with new content and bug fixes, and the devs are very active within the player base as well. There are ALWAYS people playing this, so it doesn't matter where you live, you can always find a game to jump into. Most people have microphones too, so don't be afraid to engage in some crew banter to make everyone's jobs easier.If you love being involved in quality teamwork where every person makes a difference, consider picking this game up and playing with your close friends or make some new friends to regularly experience the joy of blowing someone else's ship up. Join a clan or fly solo, make a name for yourself, and become the most feared airman of the skies!			",143,28,3,17,10,1,10

												Guns Of Icarus Online is one of the best games i have played in hole my life.Why?Good graphics. AWESOME gameplay. FANTASTIC community and developersYou got 3 classes to choose from that plays very differently from eachoter so no matter what type of gameplay you like you will LOVE this game! Its also really cool with the in-game voice chat or if you dont like to voice chat(or dont got a mic) they also got some awesome built in features so you dont need it.Communicating and TEAMWORK is the key to victory in this game. You will also learn the game very fast and easy due to great tutorials and help from others!And the community and players here are really cool!The developers are also very nice and open for feedback. Conclusion:Everything in this game is good and i can not find a single negative thing about it atmSeriously i really hope you consider buying this game because its an amazing game and you won't regret it :)-Markus ;)			",79,20,5,9,5,0,2

												*I am redoing this review because there have been a lot of updates recently and some of my opinions have changed as I have played more of this game.*Guns of Icarus Online throws you onto the deck of an airship with either three friends, three players you've never met, or three AI (which are really well done in this game, I'd rather have one on my ship than a new-ish player). You will have chosen one of three unique classes, each with a very specific role on the ship. Because this game is about ship-to-ship combat rather than characters fighting, you have no health bar, no weapons, and you cannot leave your ship. Your job is to be one of the four players or AI that function as a ship, and your ship is the equivalent of your character in a match of, say, Team Fortress 2.The ships in Guns of Icarus Online are all unique, and are comparable to a class-based game like TF2. They range in difficuly from the easy to learn, hard to master Pyramidion and Goldfish to the unwieldy but deadly Spire, Squid, and Mobula. Advanced captains and crews with often only choose one of two or three ships before a match, since each ship is like a small FPS level with the guns, helm, hull, balloon, and engines in different places for each, and these crews will want to know their ship inside and out. It is very important to choose a ship that everyone on your crew feels comfortable with, and if not, choose a beginner level ship (not to say that beginner ships are any worse than the advanced ones, this game is fairly well balanced).With all this talk about crews and captains, maybe you're wondering how the lobby system works? Well, I'm sorry to say that joining a match can sometimes be a pain, especially with such a small playerbase and a rather bad auto-match-finding button. You used to be able to just scroll through the servers and choose a game, which was much easier and faster (not to mention you could see how many people were in it and what gamemode it was before joining). Once you are in a lobby, things can take a while because it is essentially the ""briefing room"" for each team and crew. Once a gamemode (TDM, KOTH, or a KOTH variant called ""Crazy King"") and a map (Since the game is using an older version of Unity and the graphics are nothing special, many of the maps feel the same), your team (2 ships, 3 ships, or 4 ships) will begin to sort out which crew is piloting which ship, if they want more than one of the same ship, loadouts, etc. Captains can edit the ship and loadout for their crew, and even change the name (I've seen everything from ""Basilisk"" to ""Spirit of [insert name from anime]"" to ""YO MAMMA"" to ""i dont know wha im doing""). Captains can also change the paint job on their ships and change the guns. Guns are found in two sizes: light and heavy. Each ship has light hardpoints where you can only mount light guns and sometimes heavy hardpoints where you can only mount heavy guns.Classes work similarly, with the only difference between them being their loadouts. Loadouts in this game are items or tools. Each class can equip 5 items, 3 items their class uses and 1 that each other class uses. For example, the Engineer class can equip 3 engi items used to repair or buff parts of the ship, 1 gunner item which is a special type of ammo used to change the attributes of a gun, and 1 pilot item which can be used to move faster in a certain way, slow the ship down, or deploy a smokescreen among other tricks.The soundtrack to this game is great, as is the steampunk art style. The maps are creatively designed with giant buildings, shipwrecks, and mountains sometimes making mazes that are difficult to navigate. Dust clouds are a constant problem for any ship, as the more nasty ones will eat away at you engines, guns, balloon, and hull. However, clouds can be used to your advantage as they hide your ship and make it very hard to spot.The community for this game is one of the best, despite being very small. There are many community created cosmetic items added through the Steam Workshop that have made their way into the in-game store, which only sells cosmetics for players and ships (No P2W here!).The last thing I'll talk about is the upcoming Co-Op and Adventure Mode gamemodes. Co-Op will give you a chance to fight against waves of AI planes and small airships while keeping your ship alive. This leads up to Adventure Mode, which is the planned MMO world based on factions, trading, piracy, and lore. It has been delayed multiple times, so it probably won't be out anytime soon.My final thoughts:This game is great for anyone that enjoys games that require teamwork and a healthy dose of competition. It's also a must-buy for fans of anything steampunk. It has mediocre graphics and optimization, sometimes aggravating waiting times, but the gameplay makes it all worth it.I'd put it at a 9/10If you read this far, I'm genuinely amazed :P			",62,12,0,3,5,0,6

It requires a certain type of teamwork and strategy that you don't see in any other games. The community although small is also very awesome. You join a match and people are friendly despite everyone's skill level. Also it seems like everyone knows each other. Like I said it is a smaller community there aren't thousands of players playing. You will run into the same people many times. Anyways I haven't even hardly described what this game is but I would strongly recommend this game to anyone			",47,1,0,4,3,0,2

												I could say a lot of things. But I will simplify it with what I have been looking for a good time: This game has one of the best communities ever. Some rare times there may be someone that had a bad day and can't focus right, but almost everyone show respect and are fun and cool to play with, even this being a pvp game. Why does this happen? Because it's not a hardcore game. You won't have to expend every single millisecond of the game paying attention at what you are doing and have to make every move right. We have moments to breath and prepare for the tough parts before they arrive. I believe this method of stress reduction helps people being a lot nicer to each other. Another plus thing on this game: Flying stuff and steampunk game style, how not to enjoy that?			",44,3,0,9,5,1,16

												How do you know a PvP game is good? You have fun losing. I have never had a bad time playing this game. It can be intense. The strategy is remarkably deep. Like any game where you play with strangers, you run into the occasional jerk but they are in the vast minority. The different roles and ships combine to make for a highly varied experience The matchmaking system seems to be about right on, producing close matches and nail-biting conclusions. Best team PvP game since Quake Wars.And important stuff about actual gameplay aside, it's pretty too. The whole steampunk Zeppelin fighting thing is absurd but it's just far enough out to let you gloss over things like how hull-armor is a machine you repair but not so far out that if feels silly or arbitrary like if it was some kind of magic spell you were maintaining.I cannot more strongly reccomend playing.

I'm not saying all of it is annoying and I'm totally not saying that A LOT of it is annoying but there is a large percentage of completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and/or just generally incompetent. 9 times out of 10 I have to direct my shipmates on what to use, where to go and whatnot. It's annoying to have to teach your entire crew how to play the game, especially when you're being shot at. It's EVEN MORE annoying when your captain slaps on an entirely long ranged build then screams and cries when you're decimated at close range. Or when your teammates care nothing but getting THOSE 1337 POINTS THO all in all a 9/11 game buy it you filthy animals GO BUY IT			",160,7,1,14,15,0,17

												Guns of Icarus Online is a steampunk/dieselpunk, multiplayer, first-person shooter that focuses on airship combat. Each airship is controlled by up to four players, with each member of the crew taking a specific role. Players can choose three different classes: gunner, engineer or pilot, which will allow them access to different kinds of tools. The captain of each ship chooses which weapons to use in his/her ship. There are also several ships available:    Galleon: the Galleon is by far the biggest and more resilient ship. It is, however, the slowest. It focuses on high firepower and tank capabilities.    Squid: the Squid is the fastest ship in the game which allows its commander to outmaneuver enemy ships. It is also one of the weakest.    Goldfish: the Goldfish has a main gun on its prow, and two secondary guns on the port and starboard sides. It relies on its moderate speed and high maneuverability.    Junker: the Junker has 5 small weapon mountings. It also has high maneuverability, but a slow speed.    Pyramidion: the Pyramidion has two guns on the top deck and two on the low deck. With very high damage output, but slow turning speed, this ship is very versatile.    Spire: the Spire has a very high turning speed, but a very low linear speed. It is a high dps ship with very low hull armor.    Mobula: the Mobula has 5 weapons on the front and none on the sides or the back. It has great vertical movement, but is hard to repair in the heat of the battle.On December 23, 2011, Muse Games launched a Kickstarter project to raise $10,000 to partially fund the development of Guns of Icarus Online, and the company subsequently received $35,237 at the close of the bidding on 21 February 2012.

												Guns of Icarus is good! (for a more in depth review see below)Guns of Icarus is a game heavily focused on teamwork. If you are not a team player, this game is not for you. However if you are looking for a great team orientated game with lots of features (including three similar yet somewhat different classes, ship and character customization, detailed maps and more) then this game is definitely for you!The graphics, although not the best, are still fairly good and the art style is something I haven't seen done right in a while. The gameplay itself is amazing, with a crew consisting of a pilot and three other players which can be either engineers or gunners. The objective of the game is to destroy your opponents ships whilst keeping yours in the air (good luck in doing that if you have a pilot who drives like a toddler behind a toy wheel). This simple objective makes for some amazing moments where sometimes you find yourself ganging up on some of your closest friends (you may find yourself screaming at them because they failed to fix the balloon in time or steer away from the big pointy rock...).Overall I believe that Guns of Icarus is a great game with massive potential. The only downside is the lack of interest in the game nowadays. Sometimes you find that it's really difficult to find an open game in your region which can obviously be a negative since this game is strictly an online multiplayer only game.I rate 8/10 for Guns of Icarus			",124,13,0,18,14,0,9

												Definitely one of the most enjoyable coop games I had the chance to play (provided you find the right people, that is, but that is an issue all games have).+Purely experience and skill-based game, with no reliance on level or exclusive equipment to defeat opponents+Various playstyle possibilities depending on your airship type, its loadout and your equipment.+With all the games dependant on quick reflexes and APM more than anything else, a game basing your proficiency on tactical and strategic approach is definitely a blow of fresh air in the teamwork-oriented PvP games.+Aesthetically pleasing+Steampunk *_* (dieselpunk, whatevs, you get the ""drill"" :P)+Heavily teamwork reliant, at the same time clearly set goals and easy approach make it easier for people to actually work TOGETHER in a teamwork-oriented game for a change.+Challenging, and always leaving a room for improvement in your ship destroying efficiency.+One of the best gaming communities out there :*-(Applies to open games only, doesn't really affect premade teams)Either takes a long time to start a match OR you start a match fast with people not knowing the plan behind your ship and its choice of layout.-Some achievements are RIDICULOUSLY hard to do (sorry, completionists :<)			",236,55,3,52,21,2,37

You also need a good captain who understands the ship he is flying to position the best firing solutions to his gunners while not taking to much damange.  You NEED a really good gunner or two. A good gunner will make all the differance between victory or defeat.   If you achive this magical combo you will have so much fun.

												Some of you will probably be on the fence about buying this game; well, if one strager's opinion is enough to push you to the right choice, then take mine. This game of high caliber, if you enjoy team-based conflict with a complex network of support, and its graphics are quite nice. There are many maps to play on, and even a practice map for people looking to organize themselves or test their flying prowess. If you didn't figure out already, Guns of Icarus is about teams of 2-4 airships with crews of 4 fighting to the death in midair. The game is set in a steampunk-like world, and the three classes, engineer, gunner and pilot must work together, along with other tam ships to destroy the other team and keep their ship alive. So if that's your thing, this is the game for you. Unless you don't have friends. This game is way more fun with friends in a skype call.

												Guns of Icarus is probably one of the most rewarding team-based games I have ever played, but it is not without its flaws.The good:+All 3 classes are distinct and you need a healthy mix in order to play well.+Both the ships and guns all play rather differently, but mastering them all feels great.+The maps have a nice variety to them and feature both cover, sandstorms and open ground.+All in-game items for sale are purely cosmetic and you can even unlock some as you play.+Almost every victory feels rewarding as it requires a lot from the entire team.The bad:-The soundtrack is rather limited, although judging from the dev updates that might change soon.-Communication is key, so if you or your team members don't have a mic and refuse to talk - you'll lose.-The game is currently multiplayer only, so wait times can be rather long before finding a match.Bottom Line:Guns of Icarus is an absolutely fantastic niche title that mixes steampunk, co-op ship management and even arena combat to make for a great experience. However, I would recommend picking up the 4-pack so you have friends to play with as going in completely alone can lead to a poor experience.			",157,45,0,20,14,1,30

												Guns of icarus is a team based game where in you fly a zeppelin with your crew consisting of four people with three roles to choose from, Pilot, Engineer, and Gunner. Choose your ship, your guns, your equipment and duke it out in 2v2 team death matches.This game is extremly original with the exception of one other game similiar to it. It focuses very hard on competitive team play and has a slightly high learning curve.The only downfall this game really has is that you can buy cosmetic items in a real currency cash shop to deck out your player in cool clothes, even though they are strictly cosmetic and no effect on gameplay whatsoever they are slightly on the expensive side and the fact you have to pay for the game and you still see a microtransaction shop leaves a sour taste in the mouth.But overall guns of icarus is a fantastic game especially if you and your friends are looking for a great team based game to play with each other.

												This game is a hidden gem. If you have friends to play with (preferrably in a LAN setting) then you should get this game. It takes cooperative, strategical teamwork in video games to a whole new level. Each role that you play feels distinct and makes you feel like you are directly contributing to the success or failure of your ship. PROS:- Distinctly different roles to play- Genuine feel of teamwork- Many customizable options available for your character and ships- Good tutorials and a rank system that help you build skill before jumping into matches with experienced players.- Very nice in-game communication tools if you don't like using a mic.CONS:- Graphics aren't the best- Community is relatively small- Having one or two bad players on a crew can ruin the experience for everyone- No single player options or players vs AI options			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really good game. All three of the different classes are equally fun to play, and are all extremely important to the team. There are only two ways I can think of to improve the game. 1. A few new types of guns to put on your ship. 2. Improved AI (seriously, the AI gunners have terrible aim, and the pilots can barely fly the ship.). Other than that,this is an amazing game and is definitley worth the $15.			",18,15,0,6,4,0,1

												Lots of high flying steam punk fun.Pilot a battle blimp, fire the main cannons, or keep the tub in the air with your trusty rubber mallet, every role is important and each air ship requires a different strategy.There is no P2W that you might expect in a lobby based game, the only thing money will buy you is a bit of bling for your character or ship.Not to mention the Unity engine provides a wonderful environment with great visual effects and it is all topped off with a very fitting sound track.I do indeed recommend this game, just beware the Goldfish.

												This Game of Icarus this is one of the best game of 2017 i bought the same time with DLC, i also buy those 2 to my big brother... only i can say is Multipler/ COOP, 4 Players on a Ship 1 pilot 1 gunner and 2 engineer... damn even you got ping 200 ping - 400 ping the game still rock, those players using laptop like me am using low resulotion 1020x720, all disable, to remove those lag... !! this game required Team work and using your headphone with microphone to communicate to the crew... if you have abilities to lead a group try the CAPTAIN Aka Pilot! which we take the helm and command or sometimes he ask advise to his fellow crew... No good on pilot? Right Gunner is for you will focus on shooting the Airship, No good on piloting or gunner? SO engineer is your job focus on repairing everything, and keep them working at all times, removing fire on those engine, balloon and Hull.. >:D  there lots of skill there.. i still playing the Skimish mode aka PvP, if you dont feel playing those pro players why not PvE In Alliance Faction aka 5 faction to gain points for your faction to gain a land while fighting to those AI Ships,... battle for each other ...for point to conquer a land... this is the DLC the 5 faction... Chalado! for the Order!!Once again this game need team work, communication and strategy... for those starter play the tutorial hehehe >:D i give this game 9/10, some ship got glitch, for example in alliance war, boss ship just pass through us, also on those ship engine i fell while standing on a floor... this GAME is GOOD play it with your friends!!!

												Wow.. so..This game is incredible. So incredible that I would recommend it to anyone with three other friends that are willing to spend money on it too.But that's just that. If you don't have 3 other friends whom you can Skype or voice chat with.. don't even think about getting this game. It's not worth the annoyance. Yeah, there are voice chat options in-game but it all is pretty irrelevant because they're not going to listen to orders you give (if you're captain) and not all of them will know your lingo. The command ""right, right, right, right"" might be ""AIM RIGHT"" to them, when in fact you're meaning to get on the right gun. Or ""left, uptop, barrage"" might just mean ""shoot randomly"". It's not a game you can just sit down and enjoy casually. Every round is intense, thick with teamwork and if your team is properly put together.. there isn't much you can't do. If you aren't constantly updating your friends on the goings-ons of the ship.. YOU WILL DIE. If they can't listen to you.. YOU WILL DIE. Every win, every hit, every barrage will feel like you are personally on the ship.. you become almost intimate with your ship. When your balloon gets critically injured your ship sinks.. and so does your spirits as you mash the W key to ascend because the ground is coming up at a very fast rate.It's so ♥♥♥♥ing worth it if you can assemble a team of 3.

												An excellent game with an even better community, which is mainly what makes it so great. The gameplay itself is often manic, and extremely good fun - but you'll need to collaborate with your 3 other crewmates in order to take down enemy ships (I cannot stress enough how important it is to have good communication with your crew, as well as good tactics). The voice chat feature makes this very easy, but if you don't fancy speaking to strangers over the internet, there's a text chat option as well - most people are very friendly! Communication and familiarity with your crewmembers is greatly aided by the clan system, which forms the basis of the online community: you can get to know people in your clan and develop rivalries with other clans, against whom your clan may be pitted in the frequent tournaments that take place. Tactics play as important a part as execution in this game, with captains of the ship able to change ship loadouts to suit their crew and opponents; ship customisation is also available. All three roles of gunner, engineer and pilot are very fun to play, and you'll soon find which one you like best - most people start with engineer as it is often the most straightforward, at least when you're new to the game. There is a fairly comprehensive tutorial system inbuilt, as well as the game forums for more information and excellent community guides. My only complaint would be that it takes a very long time to level up all of your classes, as this is done by earning achievements and not directly controlled by the amount of time spent playing the game: but this is clearly a deliberate choice made by the developers (who, incidentally, are very active in the community) and you still have a great time playing the game.In short, an excellent little game that will keep you absorbed for a long time as you grow familiar with its nuances and finer tactics.

												Guns of Icarus has turned out to be one of my favorite games. The game has a great setting (steampunk and flying). Gameplay is really focused on teamwork, skill, and strategy. Everyone is on a level playing field. Your 'level' doesn't affect gameplay, a lvl 1 and a lvl 45 character are eually effective (aside from all the practice that the lvl 45 has...). Games are generally quick (~10-15 mins).The in-game store sells ONLY vanity items.Finally, the game is FUN!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't think of another co-operatively multiplayer game that has made me jump out of my seat and whoop for joy upon defeating an opponent.When your crew comes together and collectively out-manoeuvres, out-guns, and generally out-performs a rival crew, pummelling a hostile ship to pieces with co-ordinated effort and avoiding the worst that the enemy can throw back at you...The feeling you experience at that moment is what draws you back into the skies.I have piloted my ship through a passing cloud, hiding in ambush as an enemy ship approaches unawares. With a heavy carronade I have harried opponent engineers, pressuring them to keep their balloon functional as the rest of their dirigible degrades around them. And with swift reactions I have wrestled the fate of my ship and crew from the enemy's hands by repairing, maintaining, and empowering onboard systems and weapons to deny victory to my opponents.Gather a crew and take to the skies! You won't regret it.			",313,59,0,41,17,3,32

												10/10 would Guns of Icarus again.This game is excellent on one hand because true co-operative gameplay, that captivates a community is rare to come across and this game has done this seemlessly. On the other hand the game provides dynamics that develop the strategy of the game, keeping players on thier toes  and  continues to draw them further into the game.If you are not a fan of pure pvp content, the new DLC Guns of Icarus: Alliance is coming out in the fall which from what ive heard is pure pve content.Games like this are like endangered animals, without support they could fall flat which would be a shame because of all the amazing potential the dev team has.

												I first heard of this game when some friends of mine from a Let's Play community decided to do an Event in this game. I picked up the 4-pack on sale, and tried the tutorials.I'm gonna get this out of the way now. I'm sad to say it, but the tutorials are not very good at all. You get a really, really basic idea of the game, if you're paying close attention, but not really enough to be even basically competent. It took some good friends and a lot of trial and error to be even a little useful. That said... This game is pretty damned great. It's a 4-player co-op, but it's nothing like spiritual cousins like Left 4 Dead, though you probably didn't expect it to be... because, you know, airships. Where the tutorials are slow, the game is really, really fast paced once you get into it. I strongly, strongly recommend you get a mic, and USE IT. You'll need to be able to communicate well with your crew, and almost as importantly with the other ship(s) on your team. One really competent crew can survive an awful lot and dish out a lot of damage, but they'll need to be cross-talking constantly, making sure everyone is on the same page, and the game is too fast paced for the text chat to be very useful for this. The built-in voice-chat is pretty good, though I think it likely that many players will use a dedicated voice chat client.The three roles are very different, though there is some overlap. Anyone, no matter their role, can do any job, but your role will give you more tools that will help you to do your job better. You gain experience while playing and level up, but the levels mostly designate your experience, though they do unlock cosmetic options, tools and eventually more ships. Anyway, if you're a fan of co-op competitive games, and you're looking for something a little different, this game is excellent, and definitely worth a look.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really good game. All three of the different classes are equally fun to play, and are all extremely important to the team. There are only two ways I can think of to improve the game. 1. A few new types of guns to put on your ship. 2. Improved AI (seriously, the AI gunners have terrible aim, and the pilots can barely fly the ship.). Other than that,this is an amazing game and is definitley worth the $15.			",18,15,0,6,4,0,1

It can take abit of getting used to and figuring out where the engine parts are or when you need to fix them, however once you've got all this down and team that you can cooperate with suddenly the game enters a completely different realm with awesome multiplayer action.

												  I really want to recommended this game, you will never worry about nobody played this game. It is very interesting and one of the best steam punk game ever! Very exciting!  Graphic is good. You can even fell the cloud, fog and wind by the environment. That game has paid a lot of attention on the details, every thing from the bloon in ship to the decorate in clothes with the steampunk style.  For the audio, there have a very good back ground music, just like steampunk, gommy but hopeful. The voices of charcator also suprised me, except the genders, there has not only some ENG pronounce with different tone, but also Japanese and Russian.  It has a very unique game play. I never seen or thought that kind of game have Mutiplay, it need too much teamwork, sure it does. There has three charactors, it is easy to start it, you might think that just few buttons problem, NO, it is much complicated, you will never win a game like that. All members are human, each person in the crew need to do they part or even the others' part. As a captain you need to run the whole ship as one, mostly that job taken by the polit, but it is much more than that. You need really become a leader, your leadership is very important, you can't fire a machine gun with your polit skills, who will? your crew will, as a captain you need both polit skills and leadership to lead a ship or a fleet.   Those are just few of the most interesting part of this game, there has much more you will enjoy.			",57,9,0,5,4,0,0

												I love this game. A lot. Probably as much as I loved Natural Selection, Dota, or Mount & Blade. (TF maybe too)Rewarding, updated, good looking, and balanced. The community is great. The matchmaking is reasonably good, and there are great stats, achievements & visuals to unlock/purchase (clothing, paints/dyes themes none of which gives you advantage in game mechanics, so there is ZERO PAY TO WIN).The difficulty and complexity scales from novice to pro nicely so there's almost always something new to learn, a trick or experience you haven't done before.Short description:Exciting team-based gameplay. Not like anything you have played before most likely.Crew combat airships of various specialties/layouts in 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 ships versus ships.Each ship has a crew of at least 1 pilot and 3 ai crew, or up to 4 players per ship crew (including pilot).Usually that means a driver, a gunner and some engineers who split their time repairing damage and shooting extra guns.The learning curve for crew (non-driver) is pretty easy, the pilot is a bit more tricky (flying in 3 dimensions and leading your crew usually at the same time, often on voicecomm).A match generally consists of a lobby (either deathmatch; first team to a certain number of kills, king of the hill, or cap the flag/KotH), where a map is voted on, and both teams' ship, crew, and weapons setups are organized.. before the timer ends and the match starts (plenty of time generally).During a match you try put enemy ships in your weapons range/arc and knock out their components like guns, balloon, armor, or engines, with the hull under the armor being the finisher.Each weapon, and ammo have their own thing they are ""mostly"" used for, and a more strict effective range plus turning limit, so the pilot must work with the gunners to give the crew good lines of fire etc.Non-pilots also use spotting scopes to tag enemy ships with a bracket for easier identification at range. Ships can use cover of terrain and clouds to evade detection/damage. While piloting skills are often the most influential single factor in win:loss, a crew of really bad humans can contribute to a loss more than having ai crew sometimes, and a good human crew is ALWAYS better than the 'bots'.The view from the open air deck of your ship is nice, and you as a crewperson are immune to enemy gun fire, but you can fall off, which leads to a realistic fall-time and death with an immediate respawn onboard. Once familiar with the ship layouts this will rarely, if ever, happen, and even if it does, it isn't a match ender.As a ship is damaged, the guys with repair hammers go to work to get things repaired, which is pretty fast paced and well done as a mechanic. They also do firefighting and buffing on ship components. The hull itself cannot be repaired during the match, which is why ships want to try to keep their armor intact as much as possible to protect the hull/structure. And of course if you lose your balloon you fall out of the sky, no engines make you a sitting duck etc.People are nice and will 'teach you the trade' ""on the job"" quickly.9/10Highly recommended if you like teamwork games.

												Guns of Icarus Online is an absolutely spectacular game, certainly worth the price (especially if you and three friends all pool your money and get the 4-pack). Given that ship crews are four people strong (captain, engineer and two gunners in my group) this works out well.For an online-only game, and in absolute terms, the community is fantastic - never once have I encountered a rude player and novices actually get a chance to learn the game rather than be bullied out by the more-experienced players (looking at you, LoL).Feature-wise, the game is very dependant on teamwork, no single ship is overpowered and there are many different weapon loadouts for each given ship, making spotting and target identification a must-have skill. Each player can take five items of equipment (one sailing tool, one engineering tool, one gunnery tool; plus two extras for their chosen class), which allows for even more customisation in fighting style. The levelling system is strange but it works - achievements count towards levels, with so many achievements being needed to level up. Crucially for an online-only game, there is absolutely no pay-to-win.The game looks amazing, there's no doubt about that. Everything is beautifully rendered and designed. The soundtrack and in-game SFX are also incredible.The only downside I can think of is that if the game lags, it can have a severe impact on the entire crew's effectiveness, especially if the Captain is the one with the lag issues.

												Guns of Icarus Online is a refreshingly unique experience that deserves some attention. The game plays out by pitting several 4-player crews against each other in team-based airship battles. Every member of the crew has a role to fill and your success or failure depends entirely on you crews ability to function as a cohesive unit. Engineers will repair the damage your ship takes in combat, pilots fly the ship and are responsible for lining up shots, and gunners keep the pressure on the enemy. There is a good variety of ships to choose from each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and a multitude of weapons which can be slotted in different locations on the ship. Creating the right ship build with the right crew consistently yeilds a satisfying result. That said a twitch shooter this is not. The weapons are slow to fire and slower to reload, coordination is everything and there is absolutely no room for lone wolf tactics in this game. If you are looking for a game that rewards patience and teamwork look no further, pick up the 4-pack and invite some friends. If you feel like giving the devs a little more support there is an in-game cash shop as well but it only contains cosmetic items. Character unlocks are purely cosmetic as well meaning no player will be at a competitive disadvantage, save for tackling the games initial learning curve. I have been very happy with the game's balance thus far with the one exception that the random spawn locations during objective based matches can be wildly unfair (and that too many players fly the noobie Pyramideon and Goldfish ships but thats just a personal gripe). The community as a whole has been very helpfull and fun to interact with and the developers have made it clear that there are big things in store for the future of the game. This game could have easily been a pay-to-win copy & paste frag fest but instead the developers made something truely special. If it wasn't clear already I highly recommend this game and hope to see you in the skies.			",124,15,2,27,6,0,29

												This game is great! It is kind of like a real-time version of FTL with movement, in which you control an individual crew member. The roles are all fun to play and each one is important to your crew as a whole. The gameplay is great, requiring a decent amount of planning and multitasking ability to master, and players can develop their own unique styles of play which keeps the game very replayable. I do wish that there were more ships and maps though, but the ones that do exist are great. Each map is made in a pretty unique way which emphasizes certain mechanics, and each ship has a niche to fill on the playing field which still allows for plenty of creativity.The overall polish of the game is decent - it's a bit buggy in some places and the graphics are not AAA quality, but the gameplay makes up for it completely.
