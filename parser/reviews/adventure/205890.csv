												First of all, you may notice that I have over 900 hours on this game, so when you see a negative review from myself it is not without a lot of thought.I first discovered Chronicle back in March 2015 and was immediately hooked. The gameplay is like nothing else. Then I signed up and started playing from day 1 of the Closed Beta.For those of you that don't know, my friend Ryan and myself ran a weekly Chronicle Podcast (Friends Of Al Kharid) where we discussed the latest goings on in the game as well as having devs on to chat about things. As well as this we ran the RS Chronicle League as well as other events.In the short history of the game, I am the only person to have finished in the Top 10 of the monthly ladder five times and have also reached the final of every tournament which has been organised.So now you know where I'm coming from, it's a place of total love for a unique game that I and many others could plainly see the potential for, I'll move onto why I'm posting a negative review.In the past 6 months, Jagex have been proven to have broken promises regarding new features, balancing changes as well as a $10k Invitational Tournament. The development team has been shrunk from an already small number as people move onto other projects and key future features like a Spectator mode and Mobile release have been shelved.All of this has been without any official announcement from Jagex. This is seemingly to give the impression that development on the game is still ongoing, in the hope that they can still milk in as much money as they can from unsuspecting players.This is completely dishonest in my opinion and a seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to treat their loyal player base. I've defended them a ton over the past year but even I have had enough.The game was released too early, missing key features and thus failed to keep new players.			",37,3,2,1,6,4,14

GameplayA game plays out by placing four cards onto the board for your RuneScape character to encounter. Because your character starts with low stats, your initial goal is to train them up by encountering small creatures to fight - you fight the cards you’ve chosen and claim the ‘loot’ written on the card after it’s killed. There are all kinds of loot (stats, armour, ‘draw a card’, etc) that help level up your character but the most common reward is gold. You spend gold in a similar way to ‘mana’ on cards that offer useful effects. As the match progresses and your character becomes stronger your strategy might be to spend gold on expensive weapons and armour to help take down massive RuneScape Boss monsters with potent game defining loot/effects (Corp, Jad, Zulrah, Zillyana, etc). Or... instead of putting those in your deck, your strategy might be to be more aggressive and instead spend your gold on spells that let you strike and deal damage to your opponent directly (you win the game when your opponent runs out of HP and there are many different ways to achieve that).As a strategy experienceI enjoy Chronicle because it feels like you are always making lots of meaningful strategic decisions. You play and draw many more cards compared to most other CCGs (e.g., MtG/HS) and as a result it feels like you always have more options and freedom with every turn. In my experience so far, this facilitates an enormous amount of scope for deckbuilding as the game inherently focuses more on building your character, your agenda and ultimately, YOUR strategy. You don’t get shoehorned into doing stuff as much, like playing on ‘curve’ (creatures don’t cost mana in Chronicle) or being forced into a certain line of play/’trade’. Decision making is spent elsewhere into your character’s strategy against your own deck which in my mind exponentially increases the variety of ways to play and combo cards relative to other games. With that said though, competitive matches like in any CCG do still require you to plan your turn optimally based on the matchup, the cards left in your deck, the cards your opponent could play, has played and will play, etc, etc - Chronicle is no exception and with a fully fleshed out ‘bronze’, ‘silver’, ‘gold’, ‘platinum’ and ‘diamond’ ladder there’s a space to find evenly matched opponents regardless of your skill level or the size of your collection (or theirs...)Business ModelThe game’s business model, like almost all CCGs is that you purchase card packs with real money. Excluding promotional offers, if you buy the largest bundles, individual packs work out to be about £0.39 / $0.58 / 0.52€ each. Having collected 3000 packs worth of spreadsheet data (from watching videos/streams of pack openings) the statistics I ran show that on average 110ish packs will net you 2 copies of every common card in the game and 1 of each uncommon (assuming you recycle/de your extras and spend all of the shards/dust on crafting the ones you didn’t get). From those packs you’ll also get a good number of rares and about 3.5ish ‘legendaries’ as well. Of course, the game is still having content added and in a few weeks the first of several new playable legends/heroes will be added to the game… this represents the addition of several more card which will of course make my statistics in accurate until I rerun them. I’ll be releasing my pack data soon in a video (https://www.youtube.com/c/interjectionChronicle). F2P ModelThe F2P model is fair as well, you get rewarded with packs quite quickly to begin with by just playing the game e.g., for beating the practice mode on each difficulty setting, for leveling up your legends/heroes to unlock the basic cards and eventually a free pack, for being promoted a league in play mode, for claiming one free admission to ‘dungeoneering’ (the draft mode), etc, etc. I’ll stop there because this isn’t a guide but I will mention that the daily & weekly quest system in combination with the coins you earn each time you win a game max out at just over one pack per day for free. I’ve personally collected exactly 103 packs from simply playing the game organically since March 16th when the game entered early access (https://twitter.com/Interjection_/status/735831534402424832), though I do pride myself on being quite good at Dungeoneering and I’ve played lots of if (which has helped tremendously with progression).TL;DRIf you enjoy card games or tabletop boardgames then Chronicle is definitely well worth checking out. It’s a whole new unique world of unexplored CCG strategy with tons of potential.I hope this review was useful to you.			",1,1,0,3,3,0,3

												The feel of this card game is very different from all the other card games I have seen out there. In this game you face off against your own cards and your rival. Playing this game from the first week of closed beta all the way to its release really does show you that it has its own replayability. The meta shifts and the game has that feel of a ""perfect imbalance"" Once one playstyle gets too strong there is another playstyle that arises to counter it. If you are out there looking for a new card game to play give this game a try. They are constantly doing updates for this game and you don't have to be a old or current runescape player to enjoy the gameplay.Pros:Only had to link my steam account with my chronicle account once. Then every launch afterwards was instantly to the menu.The gameplay is really rewarding if you play every day as the daily quests feel really easy to finish.If you decide to play this game as a free to player then it is actually be really rewarding for that playstyle.Dungeoneering draft mode is a very rewarding gamemode, the deeper you get into a dungeon draft the harder and more rewarding the game gets. When you get to 7 wins out of 12 in a dungeoneering draft it gives you enough currency for a free dungeoneering run.Cons:The game has some noticeable bugs at times, But they are working on patches for those noticeable bugs.There are some very strong diamond cards out there.The challenge other players system is a bit odd at times, quite a few bugs with this.

												This game is refreshing, innovative and set in the universe of a game that's deeply rooted into my childhood. It's nothing like Hearthstone or Magic, it offers a whole new set of rules that you can explore and master.The GameplayAs mentioned above, this game is nothing like Hearthstone or Magic, as far as I'm aware, there aren't other games that use this style. Each game consists of 5 Chapters, and each Chapter you can play up to 4 cards.As with all card games, you start with a hand drawn from your deck. You do not play cards directly against your opponent. Rather, you play cards against yourself. Let me go into a bit more detail on this.All Legends start off with 2 base attack, 30 health and 0 gold. Gold is used to 'pay' for weapons, armour and other effects. You gain gold either by slaying creatures, or other support cards. Certain cards can be used to directly strike your opponent, which will help you  in the final battle. It is possible, and often very worth it, to raise your base attack, as all weapons in the game can only be used a certain amount of time before breaking. The final battle is an event that occurs when you reach the 5th area of the 5th Chapter. As the name implies, you and your foe beat each other senseless until one stops moving and explodes.The ModesAs with Hearthstone, there are several game modes that you can take part in. Sadly, while the names vary from Hearthstone, the effect is the same.Solo lets you test new decks against each of the classes in the game, and give a few Steam Achievments for completing them.Casual lets you play against other players with nothing but your pride on the line.Ranked lets you play against players of similar skill and lets you climb the ladder.Dungeoneering is like the Arena in Hearthstone; You get to choose from a few random cards to build a new deck to face off against other players that built new decks on the spot.The BadSadly, getting booster packs on this game is pretty hard unless you pay for them, and some of the high tier cards are pretty crazy. Some daily quests give you 40 coins, while some give you 200. Epic Quests tend to double or triple that.The problem is, buying a booster will cost you 1000 coins.There are some level up rewards, but in my opinion it doesn't justify the insane cost of cards.That being said, there are no quest-ecxlusive cards that give an unfair edge like Naxx in Hearthstone, and Jagex still have to make money out of this. So honestly speaking, if you like the game, feel free to spend a bit of money on it. If you don't, you'll still be able to have fun as you play!Now, I'm not sure of this next one is the game's fault or mine, but the resolution seems a bit fuzzy, even at its highest settings. Though I only have a GTX 650 for a graphics card, so this might be a problem on my end. Either way, it's not nearly enough to deter me from this gem of a game.Well done, Jagex, keep it up!I'm looking forward to your Idle Adventures game!			",146,26,0,20,23,1,15

												Chronicle is not a Hearthstone clone, but a very unique and fun twist on the CCG genre, based on what I've experienced within an hour's worth of game time or so. Overall, I would recommend this game. (Coming from a 7-year Runescape player.)You face off against another adventurer, building up gold and attack to bring down your opponent before he/she does the same to you, in simple terms. There's much more to this game, such as card effects and weapons, that build upon certain strategies.In each game, there are 5 chapters, and in each of those chapters, you can play up to 4 cards and battle monsters, accumulate gold, etc. (You'll be playing a maximum of 20 of your 30-card deck.) After the 5th chapter, your opponent and you will face off in a duel until there's one left standing.			",80,5,1,3,12,2,9

												Look, I know what you're thinking. Runescape the Card Game? Really? What a Hearthstone ripoff. That's what I said too. But I saw TB's youtube video and decided to check it out myself. Pretty small download, it's free (and I never pay money for extra card packs in games like these so what the hell) and decided to give it a shot.Is it a game changer? A Hearthstone killer? Something giant that should be upheld for eons to come? No. Absolutely not. Is it unique, interesting, fun to play, and satisfying to win? Yes. Yes it is. For all you doubting this game, all I can say is, give it a try. Promise yourself to not buy any packs (unless you wanna support the game later down the line which is fine) and give it a go. Give it a chance. I feel dirty for recommending the Runescape Card Game but it's actually fun and engaging. I enjoy it.			",36,11,0,12,1,0,9

												No. You shouldn't be playing hearthstone.As a hearthstone vetern whos been playing almost non-stop since closed beta, I cannot stress enough how different and fun this game is. It's not a hearthstone clone, and it's not pay to win. Here's an address to some concerns you might have:Lacks cards: When hearthstone came out, it had a 150-card basic set and a 300-card clasic set. This game has about 350 cards, all of which seem to have its place in some sort of niche (I'm looking at you, silverback patriarch). Some legendary and epics are really good, but most fill a niche/archetypePay to win: This game's model is slightly better than hearthstone's. Packs are 1000 copper each and dungeoneering runs (This game's draft) are 1500. Daily quests (They don't stack like hearthstone) give about 350 copper and weekly quests give 1000. The difference is that A) you can get win streaks of 100 copper in dungeoning, and B) dungeoning gives about 1000 copper in 5 wins ALWAYS (unlike hearstone, where you can get screwed with dust or a card) AND enough dust for 2+ commons. A decent player with good drafting skills can often play dungeoning once or twice (Maybe more) a day, while this is rather unsustainable in hearthstone.Gameplay: pros:not only is this game interesting, having you go on a 5 chapter (turn) adventure where you fight your own mosters for resources, culminating in a fight between you and your opponent, it has WAY LESS RNG. Games are decided by mind games and smart planning, not a spiteful mad bomber. In addition, you draw out 65%+ of your deck every game, so topdecking shenaniganery is a lot less of a problemCons:There is one thing that irks me a bit: the hero variety. There are only 5 heros in the game, and while they have wildly different playstyles, I can't help but want a few more.Overall, this game is more for the ccg player who likes to really mull over their plays and proceed to bash your opponents head in with your dragon warhammer. If that's your jam, give it a whirl			",164,48,0,26,16,2,16

												Having played Runescape since 2001, seeing familiar places/faces in a game is really nice. I can't seem to go back to Runescape, but I really like Chronicle. My playtime on Steam isn't really accurate but I had looked forward to this game since it was announced at Runefest and played a lot during the Closed Beta.I know some people may think ""Oh another Hearthstone, why not just play that?"" and all I have to say to people who think that is - It's nothing like Hearthstone, give the game a chance and you'll see. All in all, it's a very enjoyable game. Personally I like to play it when I have to waste 10-15 minutes here and there.			",171,14,1,14,14,1,10

												YES. YES. YES. Finally something original in the Card Game Genre. This isn't your typical card game. It's like a tabletop game with cards and sort of like a competing dungeon crawler. It's hard to explain it. Try it, it's free, not pay-to-win. Excellent. 9.8/10I played this before launch as well. I have around 100+ hours now and only missing about 20 or so cards from my collection. The ranked is done right too.This game is going to be BIG. Just in time too because hearthstone was too lazy to balance all their cards and are money hungry, so their game is dying now and this will replace it. Faeria is another one I recommend trying that's unique too. ",172,14,1,26,19,1,49

												Chronicles is a card game that plays like a board game that borrows elements from the digital online game Runescape.It's a turn-based adventure card game, where players will set their cards down, and watch as the turn play out. At the end of the 5th turn, if no victor is determined, both players go into a PvP to decide who wins.Pros:Unique card-based gameplayInteresting graphicsStrong emphasis of strategy and clever gamblesNot HearthstoneCons:Gameplay a bit slowSlow to earn cards without cashRather difficult learning curve.Limited classes to choose fromOverall, if you enjoy a digital board game, this will be for you. But be warned: the game will need commitment and lots of try outs for you to find the enjoyment.			",70,38,0,20,5,0,6

												It looks like a Hearthstone ripoff. It sounds like a Hearthstone ripoff. It even UIs (yes thats a verb now) like a Hearthstone ripoff. And ontop of it all it's got the Runescape branding. It's gotta be nothing but a cheap Hearthclone right?By god do not mistake it for that.Chronicle:Runescape Legends (an unweildly name if there ever was one) is, far from another in a long line of Hearthstone copycats, it instead perhaps one of the most innovative CCGs, on par with the equally interesting tabletop RPG CCG ""Card Hunter"", which by the way, I also reccomend you check out. While most card games are a simple draw a card, play mosnters and traps and spells against you opponent affair, CRL instead completely flips the formula.See, you aren't playing cards against your opponent. You are playing cards against YOURSELF. Yes, yourself. In 5 rounds of up to 4 sequenced cards (Drawing 3 per turn, and starting with 7), you are instead attempting to build up yourself to take on your opponent in a final showdown, and balancing five stats in order to do so. Your Weapon, Attack, Gold, Health, and Armor.Every turn of 4 cards, you play down cards in a sequential order, as your opponent does the same simultaniously. These cards can be mosnters to fight, items to buy, allies to recruit, and so on and so on. All of these will modify your own stats (and sometimes your opponenets) in a variety of ways in order to build yourself up. Monsters, for instance, must be killed in one blow by having an equal or higher attack than their health, or else they will strike you back, which may be a worthwhile tradeoff if the rewards for fighting them are high enough. Weapons and Armor work like in most other card games, where a weapon has a power it adds to your attack and a number of attacks its good for, and armor stops damage from reaching your health.Your attack meanwhile, is perhaps your most important stat, as, with very few exceptions, it can only increase, never decrease, and can be the difference between life and death as it allows you to face stronger monsters, and if need be, face off agaisnt your opponent in the end.While this menas many matches will have little in the way of player interaction besides the final showdown, there also exists possibility to screw with your opponent, cards whcih chip away at their health, or destroy their weapon. Some can slightly tilt the odds in your favor, some, if timed right, can absolutly obliterate an opponent, such as removing their +7 sword as they go to fight a 16hp monster.All in all, it's one of the few CCGs that actually do something refreshing with the genre, and you would be doing yourself a disservice by passing it by based on either ""It looks like a hearthclone"" or ""Oh god it's Runescape"".PS: I note some reviews are mentioning an advantage of CRL is it doesnt have crappy F2P expansions like Hearthstone. But that's not really valid, as this hasn't been out long enough for anyone to have a true feel as to the long term dev cycle.PPS: Also check out Card Hunter if you're in the market for really unique CCGs, that's ace too.

												Only a few hours in and I like this game a lot more than Hearthstone. I'd honestly compare this game more to the Talisman board game than I would Hearthstone. Chronicle uses cards but it doesn't FEEL like a card game. It feels like a strategy game that happens to have cards.Pros:+ Great variation on a CCG that doesn't detract from the CCG aspect+ Game feels rewarding to play, and has enough up-front, visible depth to keep you playing until you learn the game+ Nice art style+ Free to playCons:- Opponent character idle animations cycle often and are annoying until you learn to ignore them- Matchmaking will sometimes match you with higher level players and players with much better and more cards than you (standard pvp matchmaking issues essentially)- Earning coins is intentionally slowed via dailies and capped to discourage long play sessions- F2P card packs are expensive, building a custom deck could take a few weeks even with luckEDIT: [I previously listed Dungeoneering as not worth it, which was incorrect] After 20 wins you can gamble your coins in Dungeoneering (once you unlock it), and are guaranteed one pack minimum as a reward, plus F2P coins and possibly some of the more valuable F2P currency as well depending on how many times you win during a dungeoneering run. This is a great way to get cards without spending money.Notes:*Once you hit level 10, getting coins is a little easier and you can get about 1,400 coins/day - a pack costs 1000 coins so at this point you get one ""free"" pack a day if you put in a couple of hours to do dailies.- UI is similar to Hearthstone's but feels... off somehow (i'd call this a con but it's not a big issue)+ If you use a strong deck, you can make a lot of coins from Dungeoneering (each continuous wins will net you increasingly more coins), but without spending money on card packs, it will take a while to get a deck good enough to do so.Overall rating with less than 5 hours play time: 7.5/10Approximate rating after 20 hours play time: 7/10I definitely recommend that you try this game out, and don't spend any money on it until you've played at least 20 hours.

												First review ever, because the game deserves one.75 hours in 4 days tells you how hooked I am :) *** THE FREE TO PLAY MODEL DOES NOT SUCK - other devs should learn from this! ***In these first 75 hours I have played for free and managed to experience everything the game has to offer. With no adverts or game restrictions at all. That in itself is amazing so HUGE KUDOS to Jagex Studios for a superb F2P model.For example:- I have managed to unlock 10 booster packs, with some great rare cards and one diamond card even.- I have managed to compete in the tournament and even get up in the gold leagues with just these cards.- I have managed to complete the recently released Campaign, which was great fun. Still have more to earn there by completing some of the star challenges.So not having paid any money, that is a HUGE amount of fun and free entertainment.** THE GAME ***I love that the cards you play are against your own hero, and not the other player. That is a unique twist that really makes the game interesting. It reallly adds to the feeling that you are in a race with your hero against the other player to get to the end of the 'quest' you are both own. Kind of like Indiana Jones racing the enemy to get to the end of the Temple and claim the Ark/Jewel/Magic♥♥♥♥♥♥before the Nazi scum. ha haThe rounds in multiplayer go FAST so you need to think quick and be prepared. A real challenge for tactics lovers!I love that the game relies less on luck than other card games because you can easily cycle your cards to improve the chance of being dealt useful cards. Other card games really come down to who has the best deck, period. A new player stands little chance. That is only partially true here - you can build a very versatile deck and that is the key to this game, always having options available.The game, like all these types, demands good understanding of tatctics, strategy and deck building. You can have fun for a while by using the prebuilt decks, but once you get into the league play you will need to understand how to customise them to improve your chances.I like that the decks are 'themed' around the hero characters just like an RPG class system. This means there is UNLIMITED potential - we have traditional mage,warrior,ranger for example, but also a vampire class which attacks with her claws but can use weapons too if you want a Vampire Sword Slayer ♥♥♥♥♥ :)  Can't wait until they add maybe Monk or Ninja class and others, maybe a Samurai. Unlimited fun and imagination!The game is superbly executed, wonderfully immersive. At first I thought the 3D graphics were kind of gimmicky but actually have grown to enjoy them - adds greatly to the immersion. The soundtrack too is first class.And don't forget about the duneoneering, which is really tough - like being dropped in the deep end so to speak. I love it and can't get enough of that, a wonderful addition to the game.Finally, it runs great on my five year old MacBook Air. Not at full graphics quality, but it runs fast and smooth. I've only seen 1 bug where I have to restart, maybe happens once every 10 hours. No bad considering the Mac client only came out a few weeks ago. ",7,4,0,1,0,0,1

												I think this is a great card game/board game for many reasons.At first i thought this would be another hearthstone clone or Magic clone but it actually is very differant.Sure there is collecting cards and buying packs but the gameplay is differant.You are up against A rival who you need to defeat during the 5 chapters.You are playing creatures that aren't attacking your opponent but YOU are attacking them and gaining rewards like gold to pay your support cards, weapons and armour or dealing damage to your opponent.Support cards that you need to pay gold but gain special rewards.A Unique turn system which only takes like 5 rounds in a game.Very Simple and very easy to play and extremely fun.Your only objective is defeating your Rival, you can deal damage during the 5 chapters and during those cahpters you can play a maximum of 5 cards.At the final chapter you have a duel to defeat your Rival and see who becomes the winner.Good for card and strategy gamers.

												Unlike what the visuals and game type may seem to indicate, this game plays nothing like Hearthstone. It plays like an RPG, fighting enemies to gain gold which you can then use on cards that give you armour and weapons or which let you reduce the opponent's advantage. Each match is split over 5 rounds, and in each round, each player can play up to 4 cards, with effects ranging from lowering the enemy's attack strength to trading your own weapon for some extra armour or paying some gold to gain some extra cards to choose from in the next round. At the end of the 5 rounds both players, if they're still alive, fight eachother, using the stats they accumulated during the game. Each match takes around 5 to 10 minutes depending on how quickly players pick their cards.There are several types of classes, ranging from DER RAPTOR, which focuses on building his attack strength and armour, to Ariane, which is a spellcaster with a strong emphasis on direct damage and on lowering the opponent's strength. This leads to some interesting matchups, since while you know what a player may be building towards as a certain class, they can also mix and match cards from a pool common to all classes.I'm not much of a card game player but the combination of RPG and TCG mechanics works very well, resulting in a very enjoyable game.

												The lack of a player base for this amazing new take on CCG's truly makes me sad. I have played card games my whole life, starting with just collecting the cards for the Pokemon game then quickly after learning Magic: The Gathering and messing around with many other odd CCG's throughout the years. Never have I encountered a card game that captured me in the same way Magic did all those years ago but now I have with a Runescape card game of all things! I am so glad that I did not let the title and brand association prevent me from installing this gem. With fresh mechanics about placing obstacles such as monsters and events in the path of your ""Legend"" character to gain AttackPower/gold/health for five rounds known as ""Chapters"". Once all five Chapters with five cards placed in each have played out the two players Legends fight until death. This new gameplay conceit is a ton of fun and has proven to have quite a bit of strategic depth, EVERY player of CCG's or good turn based games in general owe it to themselves to install this game NOW.

												This review is coming from an experienced Hearthstone and former Runescape player.TL:DR: Great card game that is different from all the others. What is it aboutIn Runescape Chronicles, you fight your own cards and get ""loot"" which makes you better or hurts the opponent. The opponent does the same and whoever has the better strategy or buffs himself up to the top will win the game.This is a huge difference from Hearthstone. While Hearthstone focuses on a direct interaction with the opponent (except OTK), Runescape Chronicles doesn't. You can, of course, destroy your opponents hand, harm him and so on. But since you put four cards into the board before knowing what he will play, it's more about doing the best possible play for yourself.The gameplay is absolutely different and unique - I love it! Graphics Looks a bit like the Runescape client. Not the best graphics, but not bad either. I can imagine they made it this way for a future implementation on mobile devices. Interface	It's obvious that the developers copied from Hearthstone here. The sounds and interface will remind you of HS. The card collection, card backs, crafting system and so on. You even  have the arena system in which you can go up to 12 wins... Cost	The game itself is free to play and I'd say it ""costs"" about the same as other cardgames, e.g. Hearthstone. One pack costs 1000 coins what will take you 1 - 2 days to earn. You can craft the remaining cards and from what I've heard, there are f2p players in the Top10 aswell. It's a fair system. You can enjoy it without spending money, and the earlier you begin your journey, the easier will it be to keep up with the meta. Last Words There are similarities with Blizzards well known card game - you just can't deny it.Does this make it a clone or bad game?Absolutely not! The gameplay mechanics are unique, the setting is nice and the prices are fair.If you like card games in general or are a (ex) Runescape player, this one definitely is for you!Try it out 9/10			",1532,587,43,138,174,8,199

												I quite enjoyed playing the game for a while, there's a lot of charm to it and the way that the card system works is fairly interesting.However, the way the card system works is very much based on luck unless you make a very safe deck or a very meta deck.Which brings me to why I just couldn't continue the game: metagaming.The problem with how the way that the game works as opposed to something like Hearthstone is the amount of faceblasting cards there are and just how ridiculously overpowered they can be.  There's a lot of ways you can 1-turn-kill by going face which are completely and totally unblockable unless MAYBE you were lucky enough to have, drawn, and played at the right time something with a specifc counter which is probably too expensive for you to use anyway.Rarer cards are straight up better, and even as one of the first people to play the game I was still coming up against people with ridiculous amounts of rares smashing me apart with simply better cards that do more for less, which is obviously frustrating because no matter how much time or thought I put into my deckbuilding I'm still going to get destroyed by some guy who has better cards than me because he forked over more cash for card packs to get rares.I gave the game 20 hours to impress me and I was considering buying some card packs, but then suddenly in a matter of days I was running into every single game being a metadeck that goes face and makes anything I try to do worthless because they can 1-turn-kill me by the second turn.Go find some friends and play Pathfinder, because you're not going to find much fun here unless you like losing constantly.  (and if you DO like losing, then go play Dwarf Fortress, it's worth the investment of time to learn it)			",135,38,3,35,27,0,12

												Definitely worth checking out. It's a free to play card game, that's not a Hearthstone or Magic The Gathering clone. For once. It's also not pay to win, as you don't exactly need to buy card packs to actually win. As long as you know how to play well with the cards you're using in your deck, you can win.It's game concept is also very different than other games in the genre. It's like an RPG where you have a character that you must raise it's attack stat, give it armor, equip it with a weapon and earn gold to pay for certain stuff.To put it simply, the game is literally if the card games Boss Monster and Hearthstone had a baby. It's not a clone of either, and is a card game of it's own like no other. If you've never played Boss Monster, you should try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I strongly disagree that this is a Pay to Win game. Once people figure that the game mode 'Dungeoneering' actually is worth the time, you can get up to as many Booster Packs you want in a day. With the 'Dungeoneering' Game Mode, you automatically get a booster pack, and have the opporunity to get 2 more if you make it to the end. Even with only 5-6 wins, you've made enough copper to play again, PLUS earning shards you use to buy specific cards. Within a few hours, you're getting 3-9 Booster Packs, in addition to Shards, and XP. Doesn't sound P2W to me.			",20,3,0,6,1,0,2

												Really a shame that this didn't get more attention from players. I find it to be refreshing, fun, addicting, and even the community is good. It's a card game where you play it like a board game and it's up to you to predict what your opponent is going to do and try to react accordingly. The most unique part of this game is that you play FOUR cards at ONCE. Every turn, both players! And there's no mana. If that doesn't get you at least interested, I don't know what to say.People talk about grind in f2p, (which is what put me off of HS) and grind is part of RuneScape, so that label almost put me off of this game. Which I think happened to a lot of people, and that's a shame. If you're looking for a fun, free-to-play card game with some twists and isn't a chore, here it is.			",197,53,1,23,9,2,29

												What to say about Chronicle? It's certainly not Hearthstone, I'll give it that! What you need to realize was that Jagex was almost blatently copying Blizzard with this idea, but like the good writers they are they took the idea and made it their own. Chronicle will astound you with its unique gameplay. The nature of the game makes it so the rounds are fairly hard to predict. I've more than once turned a game completely around and more than once seen a game turn on me. It's definately worth playing.And before you ask about my minimal gameplay, I played the beta since it first came out. I can safely say this game is worth it.			",36,7,0,7,14,2,11

To name a few that I have played, I have played: Magic Duels, Elder Scrolls Legends, Duelyst, and Hearthstone just to name a few. I also have a background in paper card games such as: Magic The Gathering, Yu Gi Oh, and Netrunner. The game is going in a good direction, the game is still just waiting for that spike in popularity it really needs to pop off. The problems with the game are fixable and the developers take notice. They have a discord channel where you can talk to the developers, pitch ideas, and even complain about bugs and issues. This game has one of the closest communities and I hope it becomes more well known because it is difficult to grasp a friend's attention with a new game when the name of it is as long as ""Chronicle: Runescape Legends"". I hope this could be of help to letting people know if it is worth their time. 100% worth my time and a worth while card game to play, the cards are cool and the game has a rich and enjoyable atmosphere. Take advantage while this game is in its early stages to gain knowledge and gain an upper hand on the competition! Happy Climbing :)			",25,3,0,3,0,0,4

												Very interesting take on a card game. You don't actually battle your opponent directly until the end of an adventure, or 'quest'. Your hand is literally your adventure. You have to earn gold each round to buy buffs, weapons, effects, armor, even debuffs for monsters you place (that you have to fight yourself). Monsters give effects based on how powerful they are, some of the strongest monsters will give you permanent buffs for the remainder of the match, nuke your opponents health or even double your gold. Depending how you fare on your journey, which weapons and armors you played and what monsters you faced determine how powerful (or how good as dead) you are for the final duel.Card packs are quite expensive with in game currency however, and it does seem there are some VERY powerful cards not available from just leveling classes. Although you can disenchant cards for dust which you use to craft anything of your choice, better the card; more dust you need. You can also create custom decks based around Runescape heroes. There's a mage who harasses the enemy hero during their quest, a warrior who can become insanely tanky and even deal damage and heal based on his armor amount and a vampire who can drain monsters and her enemy for healing and inflict extremely high damage when close to death. There is also a rogue and a blacksmith but I haven't tried them, I've not seen either of those classes do well however.It's a short download, free, and very fast to learn thanks to a no nonsense tutorial. I would recommend this to any TCG/CCG, strategy and even RPG fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Day 1 Closed Beta - Veteran Review:Chronicle is what you get when a CCG collides with TBS Board Game.If you're a fan of any of those things, this is a game for you.WARNING: This game is extremely addictive.This game includes a Draft Mode, Ranked Mode & Casual or AI Play.If you're a highly competitve person like myself, you will find the ranked system especially rewarding. Just with any other CCGs, the aspect of collecting all the cards, constructing & adapting decks to the ever present 'Meta' is truly a great experience. Good news is that Jagex have done a really good job of polishing and balancing the game; always listening and taking a community feedback approach.Once you get more experience in the game, Draft mode really begins to shine, offering a fun and extremely rewarding experience. It's entirely feasible to fuel a F2P account on Dungeoneering alone. ",30,8,0,4,3,0,4

Longer version:Pros:- New and unique game play- Really easy to buy boosters with ingame currencyCons:- No playerbase (writting this review, while being in the queue for Ladder, for over 10 minutes)- 5 heroes x 2 viable decks = 10 decks to play- There seem to be very little to new cards due for release- There are decks so easy and yet so good. It is a joke. I came back this week, after not playing since October. just got 22 win streak from Bronze to Silver and am currently on a 16 Win streak in Gold with the same deck.			",14,5,0,9,3,0,20

												UPDATE: 50 More Hours Played!  See bottom for new thoughts.Unique and innovative is not always a good thing.Runescape Chronicles has a novel concept but after 25 hours I started to tire of the game.  And at 52 hours I don't see a reason to continue with the game as the only reason I'm playing it is due to skinnerbox rewards.  The gameplay itself is secondary to the process of unlocking new cards.  The new cards function as a reward but don't alter the game in any significant way for it to be enjoyable.I quite literally spend up to 30 seconds to setup my turn and alt+tab or just outright ignore the screen while doing anything else.  Repeat for the next 4 rounds until I win or lose and repeat until I finish my quest and maybe earn enough copper to buy a new pack.  Rinse and repeat.As other reviews have stated:  There is little interaction with your opponent and very few cards do anything extraordinary.  Typically rarer cards are just more efficient than previous ones.  Class cards are the same as they solely perform certain tasks better than neutral cards available to all.  There are only a handful of ways to destroy your opponent:  Strike, battle, indirect damage (killing monsters), and direct damage (spells).  None of them are new to the genre of TCG and none of them differ in any semebelence of complexity.  The skill in this game is just knowing when to use certain cards and even then it always has an element of luck to it.If the game isn't interesting enough and not complex enough to warrant more than 30 seconds per round of my eye attention then I don't think it's a particularly compelling game.  Interesting and unique to be sure.  However, it simply isn't stimulating or fun.100 Hour Mark: No matter what deck I make I cannot past even Rank 23 in Silver.  The ranked system in general feels terrible.  In Hearthstone you just need to win 3 games to advance in rank but Chronicles divides rank into huge spans of categories requiring 25 victories.  Ultimately you'll need to win way, way more than 3 games to advance in rank.  It feels very defeating and obviously not fun.Why did I play more?  Balance changes occured, I think new cards were added to so I checked the game out again.  Sadly, as a FTP player I cannot seem to get past silver.  My decks cannot be optimized due to a lack of cards.  The issue still exists where certain cards are plain outright upgrades to other cards.  There are still very few cards that individually have merit.  For example, I have a car that removes five armor from my rival.  I also own another card, with just one more attack that sets my rivals armor to 5 no matter what.This means I can remove five armor from a 20 armor opponent or take a 20 armor opponent down to five armor.  At the cost of 5 gold for a 5/3 weapon I can take down a 6 attack 10 health creature (taking 6 damage).  Or using no gold I can take out 5 armor from a rival and take 5 damage.Simply put: 5 damage to remove 5 armor.  6 damage, 5 gold to set their armor to 5 (and mine too, meaning the 6 damage I took is really 1 damage).  1 damage for 5 armor and 1 base attack.  Or 5 damage to remove 5 armor from rival and get 2 gold.That's more a straight upgraded card!  Five gold is easy to come by and the effect is far more powerful.  Most of the cards in the game are like this.			",295,129,2,67,43,0,101

												I'm not a fan of the card games genre, like Hearthstone, yet I enjoy this game quite a lot. This is a very fun game. It is actually more like a board game that uses cards, instead of dice.This game is basically a similpfied version of a board game called Talisman, but set in a RuneScape theme. If you enjoy this game at all, check out Talisman on steam too, and in real life as well.			",15,3,0,7,4,1,0

												I gave this a try after seeing Total Biscuit's video and was pleasantly surprised.  I've been with Chronicles for a bit and while the net code was a bit rocky early on, now it's solid.  Jagex has proven themselves dedicated to adding new content through the single player and the new hero, Morvan. so...this one might be worth your time investment.Chronicle is a game that looks like Hearthstone, but actually plays much differently and is closer to a single player adventure.  You have five chapters in a game and 4 events in each chapter. These are your cards, where you can fight monsters, get help from allies, or sabotage your rival, who you will face down with in combat, automated combat, at the end of your adventure.  It requires a surprising amount of strategy, but there's enough hero variety that it doesn't get boring right away.   While it lacks the flash and pizazz of Hearthstone, it's got a more casual and relaxed approach, with a very charming storybook aesthetic and solid mechanics.  This game is a lot less stressful for me than Hearthstone, even in defeat, and Jagex gives away content pretty freely, including a calendar based card and reward giveaway, great for casual or pay to win players.If I had to make one complaint it would be that most of the cards work well together in different ways, but they lack the WOW factor that Hearthstone has, since they're part of a set and less about individual flair.  That said, this game has kept me engaged, relaxed, and enjoying my duels far longer than Hearthstone, which I find frustrating with how try hard the competitive scene is.  I recommend giving Chronicle a try and if the single player is your cup of tea, kick Jagex a few bucks.  It's fun, charming, and easier to get into than other CCGs by far.			",73,23,0,18,2,0,9

												Unique twist with the ""chapter system"" makes this stand out compared to other typical CCGs on the market. As someone who has been long in the TCG-scene RSChronicle was surprisingly refreshing. If you're good at predicting your opponent you can be heavily rewarded, which is very satisfying. At the time of making this review the game isn't P2W, reached a high rank with the highest rarity card in my deck being uncommon.If you're interested in cardgames or have played RuneScape I recommend taking a look.Overall enjoyable game, a nice break from MTG and Hearthstone.

												Played Hearthstone for a few days last year, liked it, but was put off by being 'so far behind' other players and didnt want to drop money into it for expansions etc.While looking at free to play games on Steam a little over 2 weeks ago, I came across RS Chronicle. Free to play and only just out of Beta; thought to myself ""lets check this out, with the game being new I'll be on a level playing field.""Well now I'm well and truly hooked!Free to play model works well enabling you to get about 1.2 packs per day, more at the start through unlocks while leveling characters and the 'drafting' game mode can increase this again; even if you dont have success in the drafting mode you will break even in terms of packs opened. For reference 50 packs, which you could get for free in approx a month, would cost £22.50.Kind of obvious, but the better your cards the better you will do. The more packs you open, a higher chance of better cards, so there is a pay to win model in there. However for free to play, the drafting mode is a leveler and when playing with your own collection in ranked you progress through 5 leagues, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond; once you get promoted you cannot go down a league until the next season. This brilliantly puts you with people at around your level in terms of skill/deck. Currently with 80 hours or so played, I am in the top third of the gold league.The more I play the game the more I am impressed by the nuances in strategy in both building a deck and using it during gameplay.I cant recommend enough trying this out one evening, put a few hours into it for free just playing with the preset decks to see how it works and I'm confident that I will come across you in one of the leagues in couple of weeks!

												First of all, I haven't played Hearthstone or any other similar kind of game so I can't compare Chronicle to them.I can, however, say that I have enjoyed this game and have had fun even with losses. The simplest way to describe this game is having 5 chapters (being able to play 4 cards/chapter) to boost your legend and also sabotage your opponent. Boosting your legend happens by killing your own monster cards with your legend and using support cards.Sabotaging be done by either damaging rival, stealing their gold, making their attack lower, boosting their monsters, destroying their weapons or discarding their card(s). Because both you and your opponent can do this the game can become mindgames about trying to read what your opponent wants to do based on their legend and the cards they have used. Sometimes you can refrain from using a card because you think it could bite you back. But if you read wrong and don't use your cards, you may lose in the final battle because of it.  Different legends have their own cards and there are cards that every legend can use. Even if every legend has a basic, unique playstyle to them, people can have lots of flexibility in it thanks to cards not tied to legend. This can lead to the fact that even if people with same legend fight against each other, they may play very differently. This is why even if you can expect certain aspects from enemy, you might be in for a surprise. One thing I have really enjoyed is that game gives you different titles for doing certain achievements. This can encourage people to experiment with different decks and playstyles in order to earn these titles even if they are purely cosmetic. I haven't spent any money for cards but have instead earned boosters and in-game currency with winning matches, doing daily/weekly challenges, beating small solo mode and leveling up legends.I haven't played ranked nor dungeoneering yet so I can't talk about them but for me the basegame has been already enough to recommend the game.

												I've been playing this game since its closed Beta launch in 2015 and i must say i've enjoyed it thoroughly. Not only does this game allow me to relive my childhood experiences and get that nostalgic feeling it also is a new twist on the CCG genre. This CCG has become one of my all-time favorite games to play and it has suprassed my expectations 10 fold. This game is the reason my Hearthstone card-back collection is no longer complete, I've not actually touched any other CCG since this games release because they can't provide me with the thrill and experience CRL does and that is what keeps me playing. I could sit here and write paragraph after paragraph telling you why you should play this game but i honestly find that experiencing it first hand is better than reading lines of my dribble. This game is also Free so you have nothing but time to lose. ",42,7,1,8,4,0,2

The community is small but caring and growing, even the developers are hugely involved in it! I even got to vs TrumpSC against him on stream, but I'll not brag about it.Only bad thing is it's a bit buggy but still playable.Thank you Jagex for making one of my childhood dreams of a Runescape Card Game come true!

												The game has a lot of mechanics that makes it unique in the CCG genre. Although the aesthetic concept is quite similar to that of Hearthstone, the gameplay is very different with an interesting twist. Playing against your own deck is really a fun way to play, each class feels different and can play different strategies. It's really enticing to craft a deck and see how it fares. The main thing I love about this game is the feel of it, it's so addictive and simple, yet leaves room for tactical thinking and logic.As a former RuneScape player, I also gain a sense of nostalgia when I see my character fight his way through iconic locations from the world of RuneScape while listening to indistinguishable OST from the main game itself. Truly an innovative game in the genre, the game is a beauty. Doesn't matter if you're a fan of RuneScape or not, it's definitely worth giving a try.10/10 Hail Zezima 666 ",68,17,0,9,3,0,9

												Don't mind the /played time on steam, I have easily 20 hours on the game before it came to steam!This game is a strategy CCG where you have 5 stages where you could put 5 cards in a row in each stage, that either interact with your hero or the opponent. There are 5 heroes to choose from. You could describe them as Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Paladin and well... Vampire... :D Soundtrack is 10/10! Getting into the game is easy, you can learn the game by competing against AI (Bronze to Gold) and you get 3 packs for that. Getting coins and packs in this game is way more easier than in other games I played (Magic or Hearthstone). Now for the mechanics: I love the game for what they did. It feels less random (thanks RNGesus) and you feel you have more control over what is happening. You can plan strategically what your opponent might play. There was an imbalance in the classes but as more players play more heroes and get more cards this game feels outright balanced to me. They also changed the ranking system to be a lot more friendly for new players and it still feels competitive. I would recommend this game to anyone and I wish more people would try it out! I would give it a solid 8/10. And in my opinion it clearly is better than Magic or HS.			",90,15,4,23,14,1,10

												After doing some calculations I am confident in saying that this game plays itself for 80% of the time you are online.Sure, you choose which card to play, but that's it, everything else is automated. That in itself isn't a bad thing, but the card animations quickly start to take a toll on your gaming experience. You play for 10 seconds, trying to chose 1-4 cards to play during your turn, then you wait for 5X seconds where X is the number of cards played by both players. Which means that for every 6 cards (what the game would like you to consider normal is to play 3 cards per turns/chapters) you play 10 seconds and you wait 30 seconds. Then comes the ""in-between"" chapter animations, which is you drawing 3 cards and the board changing the scenery from the current chapter to the next one. That's another 10 seconds lost. So for every turn you play 10 seconds and wait on average 40 seconds.And if you want to play along vs AI be aware that you will stop making experience after the campaign and the practice mode. The only way left to make progress in your collection at that point is to use the daily login rewards or to play vs real people.Don't get me wrong, I like the game's mechanics and the level of challenge I get, but every single turn I play I feel like I'm wasting away my life watching silly animations that DO NOT make the game more enjoyable in the least bit. If those animations weren't taking upwards of 10 seconds per cards (because each effect on a card has a separate animation and cards seem to have 1-3 effects)... If only I could go afk during that time, but no, because the opponent plays cards that could affect future cards you play (in the current chapter or the next ones) and the game will not show you what those delayed effects are in a comprehensive way (the only way is to go dig into the graveyard and check every cards played one after another).

The gameplay is intriguing, combining deck building and card games, with tabletop elements to create a game which is simple to learn, but has a depth of play and strategy that will keep you coming back for more.On top of that, having played through the open beta prior to the steam release, its safe to say that the small development team are working in the right direction, providing new features and a complete ranked overhaul which keep the game feeling fresh.With viable free to play strategies, and a fair business model for those who want to invest, this is a game that stands strong on it's own.

												A genuinely intelligent and interesting twist on the CCG genre. Instead of head-to-head/card-to-card competition, you and your opponent work down parallel paths of your own design. Of course you undermine your opponent at every opportunity.Since it's free to play, it's well worth a try for any CCG fan. Give it about an hour, so you can get used to the basic mechanics, interface, etc. I wager you'll be convinced the first time you royally screw over your opponent by correctly predicting their strategy.10/10 - Would squeeze out a last minute Cabbage and Stack O' Sharks to win the match again!

												So at the time of writing this, I don't have many hours played, but I can definitely tell I will be clocking in plenty more, so I'm motivated to write a review.So I'll start by saying that this is not your average card game. You're essentially adventuring alongside your opponent, attempting to build your own resources, thwart your opponent's resources, and beat your opponent before or by the end of 5 rounds. Each round you get to place cards in a sequential order, which vary from creatures your hero will defeat or support cards that will have effects on different aspects of the game. You can play up to four cards per ""chapter"" (what was previously referred to as rounds), with each game consisting of 5 chapters, and culminating in a duel between the heroes (if both are still alive then).Right away, you should recognize this as very unique game mechanics. This doesn't play like a normal card game, as the only RNG factor is what 3 cards you draw at the beginning of each chapter. Beyond that, the game has tons of subtle strategy. How do you arrange your play? How is your opponent going to arrange their play? Have you deck-thinned appropriately to set up your final chapter plays? Do you need to play less cards to set up a disruption or advantage later?Because of this, you get two very interesting parts of table top games: The player-oriented customization and deck building of card games, and the tense strategic planning of board games. This is a pretty entertaining mechanic, and one that makes you really feel like you earned a win. My only gripe so far is that the tutorial feels very whirlwind-y. You're tossed in, literally told short statements like ""this is a health reward. [pointer is shown]"" and ""click each card to place it [all the cards light up]"", and it will take some practice runs afterwards to actually figure out what you did in the tutorial and how it worked. Overall, this could probably use some tweaking. Not excessive hand-holding (long tutorials are miserable as we all know), but even just a little bit more depth would help. Overall, it's a really unique card game that rewards strategy and plays like a very interesting board game. I highly recommend it.			",485,124,28,76,34,7,103

												It feels like a mix between a collectable card game like Hearthstone and a role-playing board game like Talisman. Basically, you level up your adventurer so that he/she can win in the final showdown with the opponent's adventurer. You do so by setting up monster and support cards. Your hero defeat monsters to earn gold and other rewards, and the support cards and generally things you can buy with gold to help your adventurer. (Things get a lot more complicated than that. It's easier to play a game yourself.) Certain cards can damage the opponent's hero before the final showdown, and some other cards can interfere with your opponent's adventure, like buffing monsters to make it more difficult for the adventurer. Very addictive and refreshing take on the genre. I highly recommend giving it a try.			",209,78,4,32,21,2,41

												On first glance, you may think it looks a fair bit like Hearthstone, but upon playing, you'd realize this is a completely new take on Collectable Card games.Premise:In most ccg games you see, all it is is two opponents playing cards to directly fight each other, however, in this game you play an opponent as one of currently 5 legends (More to come) and the cards you play are what your chosen legend encounters throughout their adventures over 5 in-game chapters. The objective is to defeat your opponent through either direct or indirect means, but you have to use your cards wisely!Gameplay:A game lasts for 5 chapters and each legend plays differently, in each chapter you can place down a maximum of 4 cards and there are two card types; Monster and Ally cards. Monsters are creatures your legend encounters and must fight for benefits to try and get the upper hand against your opponent, these benfits can be weapons, which temporarily boosts your attack or boosts to your base attack, health rewards, money for paying for ally cards, and armor that can be used to protect your health from attacks. But be careful! As many cards have side-effects, one example is the white wolf card, which upon defeating gives you two cards but causes you to recieve 2 damage even if you were unharmed in the fight. This can cause many different gamble situations that can potentially put you on top.There are some balancing problems and so far there's only 5 legends			",23,1,0,2,3,1,1

												Fantastic and refreshing approach to the CCG genre. Deck making is extremely fun and although it sucks to watch a deck that I've made get demolished, it's always great to spice up the gameplay with a different character or deck structure. I can imagine that the sky's the limit at this point and there's also a lot of awesome things to come!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having played Chronicle a fair amount while it was in closed beta, I have to admit it was nice seeing Jagex put a unique spin on the genre rather than just make a clone of the dime a dozen games out there already - which, admittedly, makes it rather disappointing seeing so many people write this game off as a Hearthstone clone without actually giving it a try for themselves.To anyone who likes the strategy card game genre, I'd heartily reccomend giving Chronicle a go. Despite what you may think going into it, the gameplay is really unlike any other and it'll definitely stand out - for a good reason.			",110,38,3,18,16,0,15

												The more you play this game, the more appreciative you become. I also played the open and closed beta for a while. There are awesome moments where you predict what your opponent will do, then proceed to disrupt their plans in the most gruesome of endings.Each hero has a very different play style, though I don't think there are drastically different styles within the heroes.I'll also note that you can have fun with the cards you get right from the beginning. It's really worth trying out this game.			",58,33,0,17,6,0,8

 Casual closed-beta player I've been casually playing this game since closed-beta and it's been fun every time. This game, unlike similar games *cough* don't rely much on luck. Here, you have to anticipate your opponents plays and play your own cards accordingly. You don't just simply play your cards against your opponents cards, no. You face your own cards, which will give you advantages whist they can weaken or even land the killing blow on your opponent, given that you survive your plays.All in all this game is great fun. Play it casually or dive deeper into it -  you're going to have a great time either way given that you're into card- and/or strategy games. Not to mention the Runescape nostalgia trip you might be having.The devs have also been quick to fix any given issues in the past and I don't doubt that this will continue in the future. The community is welcoming - so if you're a new player and uncertain about anything you're guaranteed to find help.I'd say give it a try yourself - it is free after all so there's no harm in forming your own impression.

												A simple, fairly fresh idea....bogged down by a slow, pointless graphical experience that will bore you to tears. For a multiplayer CCG type game, it is also severely lacking players. There was literally 1 other person in the global channel. PROS:-Fresh take on the ""CCG"" genre. -Simple and accessibleCONS:-The graphics serve literally NO purpose. Even the game itself calculates the round as soon as both players hit ""play""....and then you just have to sit there watching the animation forever, 5 times per match, every match....All I need to see is the card they played. The animation is too long for serving absolutely no gameplay purpose, and even after playing 5 matches it was already extremely repetitive.			",383,122,8,34,26,3,50

												Better than expected. Fun and adventurous take on card-gaming. Definitely has some tie-ins to the lore of Runescape the MMO in which I practiced grade-school escapism (years later realised the name of the game can be interpreted as offering just that - escaping from whatever problems for a good while). And the lore and feel is really fun and joyous, brings fond memories.Aside all that, this game brings new deep mechanics to the fray. Whilst still maintaining accessability. Can be enjoyed both casually and competitively, or even as a time-sink for farming new cards, for new ways of playing. Which isn't too bothersome - quests are many, offering good gp.A more deep game than Hearthstone perhaps, yet much more streamlined than MTG. Would recommend.			",524,222,11,90,46,5,90

												Ive spent about 50 hours with this game-The first half with Steam, the second with the client version. Ive also spent 50 Euro for cards, played endless PVP matches and watched a lot of Twitch.I am in the position to review this game honestly, objective and as a whole.In the following review, i will try to cover all important aspects in two variations:A short version, that brings my oppinion to the point, and a long version, that is a full review:The short version:Dont start playing this game, if you are not willing to spend much money.The basic cards are boring and useless, rewards are worse than in Hearthstone, card packs are small, drop rates are bad, crafting-rates are awful, PVP punishes players badly for losing, the balance is out of control and everybody you will face in ranked has very strong decks already. The review:CRL is surprisingly unique, with a very different attempt to combine tactics and CCG, where players do their parallel quests on two separate lanes, and use their cards to determine their next four actions per round. Which, with a complex card-pool, leads to deep games, where the order of actions, the choice of actions themselves, and the interaction with the opponent requires careful planning and thinking-ahead.As a beginner or free player, though, matches will often feel boring, flat and/or unfair, as the free cards leave little room for strategy, and have little value and influence.Cards are acquired through doing solo-missions (though thats a very minor part of the game), through buying packs, or mainly, buy playing online, which is the obvious focus on this game: Unlike most other games, theres not only one daily missions, but many small ones. Which is basically a good idea. But, since all dailys reward only little, and some require much time to complete, the feeling of getting rewarded for playing is soon replaced by a feeling of having to work for progressing- at least in my personal case.There is one Epic quest per week that unlocks at level 15, that grants 1 free booster, but which is really tough to beat, especially, for new and free players (for example: win 10 PVP games with a certain hero).Brawl in Hearthstone rewards the same, while being MUCH more user-friendly!Additionaly, non-premium-packs are expensive, card-packs are small (5 cards) and the drop-rate of card-packs is bad.Which, again, can feel frustrating for new and free players, as the progress without paying is really slow, and opening single packs is often disappointing.Which also means, that having strong cards or nor snowballs pretty fast, as fast wins grant good progress, while losing alot will lead to stalement.The presentation itself is top-notch, without negatives:From the comfortable interface, to the charming graphics, the great presentation and the relaxing music: Chronicles always feels like a professional product!But, then again, the game and server are not stable atm.I just had a game, where the server disconnected in my last round, and just before i had won.By the time im writing this, the game is still offline. And, of course, i didnt receive any rewards.And another time, the game crashed while i was overworking my deck-very annoying, really!Concerning the balancing. Its broken. That simple.High-end-decks, will easily win using half the amoung of cards than normal decks. And finally, the matchmaking...Let me make it simple by advicing not to play ranked for a long time, or until you have bought a good amount of packs.Ive played 100s of games games in ranked PvP, where about 50% were against people on a FAR higher rank than me, and almost every  opponent had a collection of strong and rare cards.Also, you will lose stars in ranked PvP from the lowest level, which means, that free players dont have any realistic chance, to ever reach a higher level, where you get the season's card back and special rewards. In fact, you will lose ALL stars per loss!!! Which means, that you need hilarious win-streaks to reach the next league, especially after the first one!Again, another huge annoyance and focus on paying customers.In the end, Chronicles is a game that should have better released as an Early Access title, and im sure, that the game in its current state will disattract many players permanently.While Chronices does have potential, its a game that is clearly designed to force players to spend money, without offering a degree of attractiveness that should cause people to ignore that disrespect.Oh, and before i forget:Dont even try to discuss objectively on the forum, or suggest any change.In fact, just leave it out completely and use the official one.As usual on Steam, a hardcore mob of fanboys is lurking in the forum...Edit, as of 04.07.2016: As of now, top-decks are refined to a degree, mostly due to extremely powerful epic and legendary cards, where it is simply not possible anymore, to reach a decent ranking without owning those rare cards oneself.I still wouldnt call this game more P2W than any other CCG, just be warned, though-Ive spent 50 Euro for cards, played very much and grabbed all rewards i could- and it brought me nowhere near the collection i would have needed to become competitive...Which is the point, where im quitting the game.All in all, i do not only not recommend this game,i recommend everybody to not play this game!Its frustrating, its unfair, its unrefined and its a huge money-grab!

												Similar card rarity system as hearthstone. That's about it. Hearthstone is a deck building orriented game as far as I can tell, this is more about the actual battling. It's like chess if you got to choose your own pieces that have powers and stuff. Gameplay is completely unique, and as of right now the game is f2w in my opinion. With the login calendars you can get packs at a steady rate even without actually playing the game. With plenty of missions as well for coins, it's not that hard to by the packs. Best of all, even lower rarity cards when played right can be just as good as  higher rarities. In fact, low rarity cards that you'll easily obtain at the start of the game are often key cards and the foundation for good decks, at least until you can get better cards.Summary: Free game, f2w, and unique gameplay, adds up to a game that I think is even better than hearthstone			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An interesting twist on a ccg with all the failings of a traditional ccg.Not being too terribly into Runescape, I came at this as something that looked interesting after TB spoke of it on his Co-optional podcast.  My thoughts?It can be fun... if you stay with mainstream characters or dump alot of money into the shop to get a good variety of cards.  trying characters like the vampire Vanescuela and trying to play to the character's theme will get you killed because there's very poor balance in the game at this time.  For example:  Vanescuela's personal cards have alot of sacrifice, drain and boosts to her main power stat.  But the drains are weak and will only work if vanescuela is already missing that amount of hp, otherwise, the drain doesn't hurt them.  The sacrifices are STEEP.  Minus 10 hp for a single move power boost of 3.  Minus 5hp to get a permenant boost of 1.  Otherwise, you need to kill a creature that has 9 hp and hits for 8 in order to get a 5hp heal and 1 power boost.  May not sound like much, but when you consider that 4 other characters have burst direct damage capabilities attached to various things: Mage > hand size, fighter > armor amount, thief > gold amount, blacksmith > weapon durability.  These are surprisingly easy to build.  The mage is capable of bursting for 20 at the cost of 8g (which can be circumvented via another card).  I don't even know how many times I lost from full hp due to last minute burst dps here.The game follows an interesting spin on ccg gameplay: The game is played in 5 stages.  At the beginning of each stage, players refresh thier hands and use those to plot out an 'adventure' path for thier chosen hero, up to 4 cards.  players then alternate turns taing the steps of thier adventure, casting/fighting/looting/buying the cards you placed as they reach them.  At the end of the 5th stage, if both characters are still alive, they auto brawl till one is left standing.Pros and cons:+++ If Runescape had graphics like these, I'd have no problem playing it.++ I like the ""plan 4 moves in advance"" strategy this game follows+ Daily 'Quests' that are unchanging and award gold to spend outside of the game.  1000g for a card pack or dungeon run.-- Anyone can have a powerful deck if they spend enough money irl.  Players like these are now very common since TB praised the game on Co-optional.-- Poor balance.  Poor, poor vanescuela :(----Despite being f2p, there is a heavy incentive to spend.  Not just for card packs but in the 'dungeon' mode since it costs 1000g per run.The game oozes charm and I do like the characters and cards.  Every deck has direct damage capability, but some have this FAR more than others.  I'll drop in and check this game out again in the future and hope for some rebalancing.			",93,16,1,22,15,1,9

												Game's dying. No communication or updates.The game itself has really consistent gameplay, as opposed to Hearthstone's RNG fiesta, and rewards prediction. It also has a better f2p model and is at the early stage of Hearthstone where you can reach ""legend"" with a f2p deck. Games are also really quick as both players play on the same timer. The create your own adventure theme is pretty unique and represents the feeling of Runescape well.			",9,2,0,2,0,0,2

												It's not worth it anymore.Mobile - This has been officially cancelled now, confirming once and for all that the game is being binned as an actively developed project. The mobile version exists, but they don't have the people to optimise or support it.Jagex have barely said anything, during this fall about the state of their game and what they want to do with it, sometimes resulting in months of radio silence while the game is declining. Which is worrying in itself, I don´t wanna support a game with blind development.The last patch (1.5.2) had a bug which reset your whole collection and player levels. Thats downright scary.The game launched into existance w/o a chat (now implemented and working), spectator mode (still not implemented/ vital for tournaments) and next to no marketing/advertising because they didnt feel the game was ready for it when they launched it. I'm hoping they can bounce back, but I doubt they'll make something big enough to draw players back.			",44,7,0,5,9,0,20

												APRIL 2017 UPDATE: Not playing as of right now, waiting for new cards/decks to be released. Will return when new content comes.Unlike other card games, Chronicle gives the player a tangible sense of both tactics and strategy.  It does this using it's unique format of playing 4 cards at a time in ""chapters"", constantly forcing higher-tier opponents to attempt to predict the other player's choices.  It is highly enjoyable, with currently ~400 different cards available for deck building, all of which are collectible for free through playtime.  The daily quests and rewards are also generous, helping newcomers acquire packs quickly.  And to top it off, it has a quirky-yet-fun aesthetic to it with the art style being visually striking and playful.From someone that has tried many of the CCGs available from Magic: The Gathering (always loved) to Hearthstone and the forthcoming Elder Scrolls: Legends (closed alpha and closed beta tester), I can say this one distinguishes itself as different, fun, and strikes the perfect balance between casual and competitive (I have no ladder anxiety playing ranked here, win or lose its just fun). I look forward to what the developers do as they continue to add new cards, new decks, etc.My only ""complaint"" is sometimes there are server issues without warning, and lag/disconnects have been more noticeable than other card games...not to say there are a ton, but they are there.  Oh, and the music is completely forgettable after an hour or so, at this point it is muted to allow my own choices on Pandora, but a great soundtrack is not something I demand a card game have.A true surprise gem in the neverending piles of free-to-play Steam titles.

Jagex Keeps InnovatingsIts been long time since i used to play Original Runescape One, with dial up connection and putting crazy numbers to my familys phone bills. Back then the game was rather revolutionary and innovated a lot and was somewhat ahead of the curve.What i enjoy about this game its rather refreshing and has great tutorial that shows up the basics, so actual learning curve is rather low, mastering the game is whole another thing however.Positives Tons of daily quests & achievements to do Lot of different variety with decks, strategies, characters and game modes Great Music Not hard to learn, tutorial teaches you all the essential Negatives Buying the ingame currency can be rather costy  Some of the sounds were rather awful ",425,179,5,53,33,3,42

												THIS IS NOT A ♥♥♥♥ING HEARTHSTONE COPY, READ THE DAMN REVIEWIt looks like the generic card game with the same crappy microtransactions and cartoonish styleBut noBased on the Runescape Universe, Chronicle offers a unique and very creative way of playing with cards, and no, you dont spend the whole time playing on a table throwing random cards, the cards come to life, you actually interact with themYou control a Legend (your character class basically), and you face another Legend (NPC or Real Player) in the classic ""health goes to 0 and you lose"" game, you can build a deck made of allies (spells and stuff) and creatures (you kill them for gold, health, armour, weapons and more stuff), The game consists in you advancing through 5 differents maps where you face the minions you put into battle (weird isn´t it) so yo can get more powerful, because in the end of the road, you face your opponent, trading attacks until someone dies, but you can also kill your opponent by casting some spells to deal damage to them while you both are in the road, and you can die because you fought against some badass minion with a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of attack and you ended up getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥The good-Games are short (3 to 10 minutes)-You dont have to put a lot of effort to enjoy this-The design is pretty amazing-You dont have to spend your whole day playing to get more cards-Getting coins to buy packs and stuff is pretty easyThe bad-Matchmaking takes too long sometimes-The lag can and will destroy your game (only if the connection is extremely bad)Overall: 8/10Go and play it while its free!

												I came across Chronicle almost by accident. If I hadn't had the day off and poked my head into TotalBiscuit's stream, I'd have never known this game even existed. As a longtime player of Hearthstone, and of CCGs in general (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic, heck even Marvel Overpower back in the day), Chronicle scratched an itch I honestly didn't even know I had.The thing to realize with Chronicle is it isn't competing with competitive CCGs and is doing its own thing. Yes, it borrowed some concepts from Hearthstone but the execution is so fundamentally different as to be wildly refreshing. And while I'm sure its newness is a major factor, the game also doesn't feel ""Pay to Win"". The cards you are given and can unlock at the start are potent in their own right. The cards you get in packs and through crafting just feel like bonuses. As for the cards themselves - brilliant.To give you an idea, I literally made a Thief deck which kills you with coins. It's also astonishingly salt free. Being burned down in three Chapters is the kind of thing that would have me throwing my monitor out the window in Hearthstone, but a combination of the presentation and the heroes being optimistic even in defeat (""Losing is the way in which we learn."" for example)...the game's really low stress.Give it a whirl. You may be as surprised as I was.			",73,18,0,30,11,2,21

												I do love Chronicles: Runescape Legends. The mechanics of the gameplay is very refreshing if you compare it to other games like Hearthstone. Everything else is just like what you would expect from a CCG; collect/buy packs, disenchant/craft cards, build decks, and match another player. However, I was made aware that the game is dying. There are only 50-100 concurrent players (according to steamspy/steamdb).  And the number dwindles bit by bit every day. The lack of player base count is probably one of the reasons why I am being bullied severely in the ranked matches. It is currently similar to the Evolve: Second Stage situation. Eventually, the developers/publishers will announce that they will stop their development of Chronicles: Runescape Legends. So, even if I do like the game, I can't recommend it to others.

Posted: June 5, 2016
												Hi all, i had been playing Runescape since about the age of 11 (2005) and always really enjoyed it but as i got older and new games come out, the call of Duty's, Grand Theft Auto's, Counter-Strikes etc i began to drift away from it and maybe going back for a month or 2 every so often just for a bit of nostalgia.i saw this game on the store for free and with it being runescape related i thought id take a look at it, even though i have never played these type of card games before, unless Yu-Gi-Oh when i was 10 can be classed the same? but anyway, i read the reviews and they seemed pretty good on the whole but obviously every game is down to the personal preference so i tried it for myself.so as mentioned, i never played this sort of game before and id say it took about an hour to become f**king hooked on it! i dont know what it is but something about it makes the game so so fun, wether its because its runescape related and some of the things you see on it give that nostalgic runescape feeling i dont know but it is such a good game.The whole idea of ranking up, unlocking new cards and building your own decks to compete competitivley against other people or AI is such an appealing concept to me, the game seems so basic but its so effective. The graphics, the mechanics of the game and even the sounds just all work. Its one of those games were a win feels so satisfying and i loss is irritating but it doesnt make me want to quit, it just encourages me to play more, get some new cards, re-work my deck to amend the errors ive made before, plus there is the option to BUY packs for cards but it is in no means neccesary, this game is no were near a pay to win, its just an option if you want to progress and tiny bit quicker, but the rate of unlocking cards just by playing the game is very quick anyway.ok so some details on how the game works as such:There are 5 legends (Characters) and each one has their own special skill set e.g. Blacksmith, Mage, Tank and they have cards that are specific to them, the rest of the deck is made up of general cards that any legend has access too. So you create your deck in a way you feel is best for the way you play, wether you like to play very agressive throughout the chapters or if you like to build your stats up ready for the final fight (ill get to this bit soon)once your deck has been made youre are now ready to go, you can start of playing against the AI (reccomeded for practice) on three levels; Bronze, Silver & Gold, rewards are still picked up for beating AI opponents. You can also play Casual matches, these are just like ""friendly"" matches against online players to ""test your decks and skill"" (as said in game) and finally there is the Ranked Matches. You start off in Bronze Division, get 10 wins and you move to silver, Silver division you need 25 to gold and these go up through Gold and then finally to Platinum. Although it sounds simple to say ""well i only need to win 25 games? easy"" yes it may be, but when you lose again, you essientally lose a win, making winning the games that much more important.now onto the gameplay. Each match consits of 5 Chapters and at the end of the 5th chapter is the final fight, within each chapter both players can play a maximum of 4 cards. Cards are dealt at the begginging of the game, each player is handed 6 cards from their deck and can decide if they want to swap any cards for another in their deck, then it is decided who will go 1st and who will go 2nd, those who are picked 2nd are given 1 extra card to start. Now that the cards have been dealt the game is ready to start. Each player has a ""Stats Bar"", these show your Weapon Stats (Attack/Durability) shown as a fraction, your base attack (which is what your character will hit as without a weapon, shown as a number in fire), The amount of gold you have (obviously shown as a number in gold coins), your health (Shown as a number inside a heart, which is maxed at 30) and finally your armour (Shown as a number inside a shield). All of these stats will change depending on the cards that are played during the game and ultimately having an effect on the final fight, if you are still alive for it.At the end of Chapter 5, you and your opponent battle it out, no cards, just you and your stats. The stats that you had gathered or lost throughout the 5 chapters are all used here. If you end Chapter 5 with (2 Base attack, 1 Gold, 12 Health, 3 Armour) then that is what you take into the fight, so it is important that through the chapters you give yourself the best chance of winning the fight based on your stats against your opponents (Note. it is possible to defeat your oppenent during the chapters and the game finishing there without the need of a final fight)When the fight is over (After one of you has hit their animated final hit) the match has ended and you will have been victorious or defeated, either way you will still earn XP, just the amounts vary from the outcome and with this you will earn cards and coins which can be used for packs or to play the dungoneering feature.I havent played the dungeoneering feature much so i cant go into much detail but its essientally a drafting system. You start the dungeon (after paying the 1500 copper coins entry fee, free for first time players) and are welcomed with a screen of 2 random legends and you have to pick one. Once you have decided on the legend you wish to play as there are then 15 ""Draft Rounds"" in which you pick 2 cards out of a possible 5 to create your deck. Once the 15 rounds are complete and your deck is ready you will enter the dungeon in room 1. You are then put against an online player in a match, the winner of that match progresses through to the next room, aswell as a reward for each room complete. If you lose the game you have 3 lives to complete the dungeon so losing the first match isnt a major issue, it is still possible to go on and complete all the room, in which i think, although dont quote me on it, that there is 12 rooms in total, At the end of the 12th room there is a big prize.I think that this is pretty much all i have to say, alot of it i know, but i thought i'd be good to give a full explanation for those who are unsure wether to download and to be honest, its a free to play game, if you dont like it then your no worse of, other than a few GB of memory on your hard-drive,I hope you found the review helpful, and enjoy playing.MasoN			",23,3,0,3,4,1,1

												Really fun and strategic game, that differs quite a bit from the usual card games we have today.I love the different mechanics it offers and the cool planning you need to do to be able to win.You have to manage your gold in the match order to use support cards (similar to land or mana, but once you use it it's gone and you need to obtain more during the match).To get gold you need to use your hero to kill enemies you have in your deck (or use support cards with specific mechanics or conditions).To kill these enemies you need to manage your hero's health and attack or else he will be too weak to kill them.And there are also weapons you can equip on your hero during a match in order to get attack advantages and give you an edge.Since it is a free game I really recommend trying it out!

												Not gonna lie, I was hoping for a more polished RuneScape mmo. lol.But what we have here is a CCG where you build a deck that partially focuses on helping your hero while also trying to trip up the opponents hero as they travel to the end of their separate quests and fight each other at the end.(supposing both heros make it all the way)It's interesting, pretty fun, and satisfying when your hand crafted deck has your opponent wanting to surrender before you're even half way through the round.You can pay to win early. But similar to other modern CCGs, if you're free to play you can grind your way to having the best cards and eventually end up at equal footing with people who might dump their life savings into the game. lol			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll start off by saying that I've been playing since closed beta, so obviously I've had many more hours of gameplay than is displayed, and from all this gameplay I can definitely say that I can recommend this game.  So now I'm going to ramble on about why this game is great and all, but if you're familiar with what the game actually is you can skip this next section. What is Chronicle: RuneScape Legends, a.k.a. RS Chronicle?  Well, I'm glad you asked!  RS Chronicle is a card game consisting of 5 chapters, of 4 slots each where one must play cards to set out on an adventure with your rival.  This game is unique in that unlike in other card games such as Hearthstone or Yu-Gi-Oh you play enemies for yourself to defeat and reap those rewards.  With these rewards, you can spend various stats, most commonly gold, to buy supports.  If both players survive until the end, a final fight will occur.  This game has the look and atmosphere of a mix between Hearthstone and a board game, and it pits the player inside the RS world of Gielinor.  It also is somewhat consistent with a few of the quests like Dragon Slayer, the very pinnacle of the F2P experience in RS.  Play Wormbrain, remove up to 2 gold (a real bargain since in RS he charges 10000 gp), and put Elvarg into your hand (who is a female BTW).  AND you get to skip Melzar's Maze.  So, yeah, it does include some of that RS charm from the classic MMORPG.THE BEST PART IS PARTY HATS COST 0 GOLD SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD ONE.10/10 would stagger grief again			",58,7,0,8,5,1,10

I have pretty much just started and I am having a blast. How the gamebalance will turn out between free to play players and those that do pay, I cannot say yet. If I feel the game leans towards pay to win I will probably stop playing, but the hours I've invested untill then will still be worth it. It's simply that fun!I urge everyone to give it a shot. It's free, and while it maybe won't hold you for long, it will put a smile upon you when you first try it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Chronicle: RuneScape Legends is a solid CCG alternative to Hearthstone. However, dont look at it as a Hearthstone clone because the mechanics are really different. It's fun and simple to play. I dont have enough experience in the game to say if it's P2W or not, but it doesnt look so.In Chronicle: RuneScape Legends you dont need to grind really hard to get booster packs because you can get 75 points for every offline win against bots and buy a booster pack for 1000 points. Yes, you can buy the in-game currency with real money but, like Hearthstone, I don't think that's going to have a significant inpact in the game.On a final note, Chronicle: RuneScape Legends is a fun and fast game to play casually if you have some free time.

												I usually try every major CCG release I see.  This is the only one I've played in the past few years that's REALLY different from Hearthstone in terms of actual gameplay, and is actually good.The premise here is that instead of deploying minions to attack your opponent like in every other CCG, you play minions which you must do combat with to increase your own stats, weapons, and gold.  After turn 5 (games are short, but satisfying), you'll use whatever weapons and attack upgrades you have to slug it out with your opponent until someone is dropped to 0 health.  Note, however, that games often end before the final battle because you and your opponent will likely try to damage each other and complicate each other's battles before the final showdown.  For example, maybe your opponent has a default attack of 2, +3 attack from a weapon, with 1 durabillity left on the weapon.  You play a card to reduce his weapon durabillity by 2, eliminating his weapon.  He already committed to attacking his 8 attack, 5 health, card expecting to take it down in one round.  But without his weapon, he's forced into 3 rounds of combat, and dies to his own card.The only real negative I can report is that the combat animations can be slow at times.  This this more of a problem when playing against the computer than when playing against a human, since against a live opponent, you can use the few extra seconds to think about your next turn.  My concern is that this could be an annoyance to new players who are only playing the computer to grind out some free cards, but it's not as big a deal once you're playing real games.  Bottom line, if you like CCGs, I suspect you'll like this one.			",33,6,0,6,0,0,10

												Alright I will start off by saying whatever your opinion of Runescape is it doesn't apply to this gameI know there are things in this game that are an obvious ripoff of Hearthstone but this games mechanics are much differentI have tried a few other TCG(trading card games) and so far this one is the most enjoyable. There is a lot more strategy involved in my opinion and the concept keeps me interested a lot more than other TCGsLastly, I haven't played enough to tell you if it is pay to win. But either way I would give the game a shot.			",101,18,1,10,4,0,6

												Chronicle: RuneScape Legends is probably one of the most unique card games I have played yet. You chose a hero, and play your cards out against your hero as they ""adventure"" across the board along with the enemy hero. The cards hinder and help the hero, fighting a monster card may injure the hero, but earn gold to be used to make a purchase from another card down the line. Cards have a variety of effects when completed, such as healing/ harming yourself or others, granting or removing armor, attack, or weapon stats, or even initiating a duel with the enemy hero. At the end of 5 ""boards"" or levels if both heroes are still standing they duel to see who wins. I recommend anyone who likes card games try this, Ive never played anything quite like it I don't think.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												I want to start by saying that I've never played RuneScape and have never been interested in the experience it provided, however this didn't deter me from trying this game and it shouldn't put you off as well.An amazing game that honestly feels like it should have more players than it does. A very intriguing combination between a dungeon-master-like adventure creator and CCG. Every game feels like a different adventure and presents different opportunities for you to demonstrate your strategic abilities. Aquiring currency for packs isn't hard and seems fair, although it might feel otherwise thanks to the bigger numbers involved. This game just feels so unique and fun and if you're a fan of card games you really should give this a go, since it's free.			",438,186,7,58,27,6,49

												I've been playing since closed beta, and have been heavily addicted ever since. Its a truly unique card game, far different from anything else out there right now.The core concept is you aren't a summoner, you are an adventurer. The cards you play are encountered by YOUR legend, and they fight and interact with them. You play the game in 5 chapters, 4 cards per chapter, and end in a fight with your rival if you haven't already killed them. Cards have effects, stat rewards (gold, armour, attack, weapons), or a combination of them. As you play cards, you build up your base stats and can play ever more powerful combos.The chapter limit means that games don't last a long time, and forces you to think strategically about what you play and when. Every card counts, more so than in other games. Even the basic decks you get from the tutorial have little ""filler"" cards. Relatively short games means you can always find time in the day to squeeze in a few matches, and claim the generous daily quest rewards.I've played many other card games in the past and in all honesty, none of them compare to how fun this is. The developers have great interaction with the community too on the forums, twitter, twitch and reddit. Feedback is earnestly listened to and any issues raised are addressed, and have teased of great new content to come.Join us! You'll never look back.			",17,5,0,7,0,0,9

												Definatly NOT Hearthstone!This game has the same aethetic as Hearthstone but is a completely differant game.  Check it out.  I highly, highly suggest it.  Cards aren't overpriced.  The graphics are pleasant.  You can see your opponent's avatar across the table from you.  It's in my opinion, a better game than Hearthstone.			",141,39,0,48,7,0,20

												A few hours in, played a bit of the beta, here's my take.You may think it's just yet another card game like Heartstone, Hex, or whatever ... And you are far away from what this game really is. Combinig board game and deck build in an awesome way to provide new gameplay and new mechanics for a very cool experience.It may need a slight balancing for some ""Legends"" ( the ""Hero"" ) and some cards, but overall, a really fun game to play !

												Fantastic strategy card game unlike anything else I've played. Highly addictive and very competitive once you get into it. I’ve been playing the beta for some time and plan to continue playing.Very easy to learn the basics and you’ll feel like a genius when you start putting effective card combos together and start winning your first games. It becomes more challenging as you try to build more experimental decks and compete with elite players, but very rewarding when you succeed. As card games go this looks stunning! I highly recommend it!			",5,1,0,5,2,0,1

												Only just got round to downloading the steam version of this game; I've played maybe 40-50 hours beforehand. I honestly can't find a major fault with it, the concept of the CCG is completely unique. The presentation is also something I very much enjoy about the game, and it almost gives the impression that you're playing a board game (although it is very much a card game). You can quickly get going with incredibly generous rewards from the game, and a majority of the most used cards are common and rare, meaning that the game is hardly pay to win (although the dev's totally deserve money). There is minimal rng in the game (except for cards which 'randomly discard' from your hand, which is probably the only problem I have with the game, albeit incredibly minor), as you draw a majority of your deck in a game, and it's rare you're ever truly out of a game, which makes it all the more enjoyable.Truly an exciting new card game, I just hope it lives long enough to become massive.

												This is a very refreshing entry for a digital card game.It is also extremely easy for beginners to start and learn.A lot of it's elements were borowed from Hearthstone, such as how the arena works, its rewards, how much it costs, how much the packs cost, etc. But that's actually a good thing in my opinion.In some ways the game lacks interaction, but I suppose the differences are what makes it shine. If it were just copying other games, it wouldn't be any fun.			",106,39,3,15,10,1,13

												Chronicle: Runescape Legends plays like a mix of Hearthstone and Hands of Fate with Runescape's graphics and lore thrown in. And that's great!It's a fun game to play and a fairly original take on a card game with each player basically fighting through their adventure until they fight at the end - it sort of reminds me of a timeline of Runescape actually with two people making player killing accounts and levelling them up until at last they can fight with them - and maybe doing a few test attacks on the other in the wilderness before running away to fight another day.So, the gameplay is well done. I haven't played much so I can't say how well the decks customise yet.Unfortunately what Chronicle lacks is a good user interface. All of the little elements that make a card game like this that much better are missing - when you open a rare card (depicted by a sapphire, emerald, ruby or diamond) there is nothing to highlight the cards specialness - it's just ""oh a a card with a stone on it"". During play there is a fire effect when a card is discarded but the card disappears too fast to really see it and the fire effect looks bad. The My Collection screen is just a bad clone of hearthstones; particularly disappointing about this is that they don't have card lore which with characters like Ali Morrisane appearing as cards is a real shame. I was also disappointed that when I finally earned a card pack there was no notification; it just silently updated it for me to eventually find.All this having been said, Chronicle launched yesterday and considering its actually very nice, original gameplay and the cool 3d opponent and board I would definitely recommend it. The problems with the game are minor and I think that they can definitely be fixed.Give it a try!---A Small NoteOne tiny problem I have with the game is that I feel that the class route they've taken (mimicing hearthstone) is so unlike Runescape itself where you can develop in any and all ways. I understand that not having class only cards limits the ways that the game can develop but other limitations could have been put in place to deal with this. Think they've missed out on a lot of customisation of characters appearance that they could've charged for too in doing this.Overall I don't mind because the name itself suggests more of a lore exploration focus which they can do through using these iconic characters. But still.EditsEdited 06-06-2016 for readability of one of the paragraphs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before this review starts, let me be clear, this IS NOT a carbon copy of Hearthstone. (I can not stress this enough.)Chronicle has been quite the adventure. Coming from the closed beta, i can sincerely confirm that this game has gotten better as the game become more refined. From the competitive mode being completely reworked to the addition of Dungeoneering, crafting recieving a rework, in-game currency, and more booster pack opportunities, the game has grown into a fantastic edition to my library.Pros:• Graphical enchancements compared to the closed beta.• Some overpowered cards have been reworked to balance out the game. (I'm looking at you combat monolith.)• Excelent diversity of cards from the get go.• Balanced gameplay.• Each legend has their own unique style of play and weaknesses.• Casual and competitive gameplay.• Daily challenges to keep us playing.• Epic challenges that gives huge rewards.Cons:• More legends would add more game styles into the mix. 5 is good for now but for longevity reasons, there needs to be a greater length of legends.• Legends are usually stuck with a niche role. More diverse legend gameplay would employ more tactics to the game.• A new player friendly tutorial would be a nice addition to the game.• Interfaces can be a bit buggy where i have to press Esc to make the interface highlightable.• Hardly any players. This is partcially due to a somewhat lack of an advertisement campaign.Overall, this game is a strong game with a lot of potential. No game is perfect in any way but, it is extremely promisisng to grow into a Hearthstone competetor. And the best part is, IT'S 100% FREE! GET IN SON!Rating: 9/10TL;DR- This game isn't a Heathstone copy and it's unique with different gameplay to said game. Some bugs and nit picks but it's worth a the try and it's free. 9/10.

It feels like an actual adventure and when you win, it is the most rewarding experience I have encountered in any card game.

												Pretty great/fun game. Although it is a card game it's hardly anything like Hearthstone or Cards and Castles. The way you play is a refreshing take on the card game genre and the way you can strategize by utilizing the board and turn system makes for some fun gameplay.I haven't spent any money in game but I feel like matches are fairly even/fun. Dungeoneering/Arena is also really awesome and it's pretty easy to afford as long as you keep up with your quests and stuff! Hopefully, this game continues to get updates and stuff - I used to play Hearthstone in my spare time but I think I'll switch to this instead since I have way more fun on it.			",86,15,0,21,5,0,11

												Review of Chronicle: RuneScape Legends (26.5.2016 (Release Date))I have to say, holy freaking cow, that game is AMAZING.It´s hilarious fun and has a completly new game idea.Of course, one or two things are copied from games like Hearthstone, but still, it´s completly different to what we currently know.Some things have to be added, for example some ""Hit sounds"" in the final battle.Gameplay: You have to unlock your hero first and go to a quick Tutorial.In this, there´ll be explained what Symbol what means, what creatures you fight, how you get Armor, Damage, Gold, Hp and so on...You start with a hand of 8 Cards. From those cards you can get the stuff from above.Also there are 2 Kind of cards, Monsters and Support cards.You have to fight the Monsters to get stats from above.To use the Support cards you have to spend the gold, that you gather from Monster that you´ve killed on your journey.Each game has 5 chapters with each 4 stages.On those stages you can place the cards how you like.At the end of Chapter 5 you fight your enemy (if you survived till then), that has been on the side of your journey all along.It´s pretty hard to explain, I´d recommend you to try it out yourself!Review:Pros+Good Tutorial+Completly new game expirience+Lots of fun+Longtime playable!Cons-Some buggs/missing Sounds-Kinda P2W (it just speeds up to fullfill the card collection/get a other Card Background etc.)-No ChatFinal Rate:Would I recommend it?Yes, deffenitly.Will I play more of it?Hell yeah!Rate 8/10Ps: I´m sorry that my english isn´t the best, I still hope you could understang me tough!

												RuneScape Legends is not a Hearthstone, clone it is much more like a Solitare card game with some light deck building and stratergy. The game is play out like a two players both competing to amass a large score and the winner at the end is the one with the highest score, There is very little interaction or direct combat between the players. EDIT: At higher levels once you unlock more cards and go up against better Human players there is some nice card statergy depth.How dose it compare with Hearthstone, MTG or Hex.Its is a very casual, card game that is rather lacking in depth and complexity that is seen even with Hearthstone. Currently has less content then any of the above games, though to be fair it just launched with little fan fare and the lack of content is to be expected. Dont expect spending long time crafting your decks, or carefully playing out cards. Most of the statergy is light weight. It comes down to building up a strong combination of cards and playing them out for max advantage, Each turn can be easily played out in under 1min with 5 turns for a game. Wish the animation could be speed up.FreetoPlayLike all card games, booster packs can be earned with in game currency. Daily quest provide a good amount of gold though less generous then Hearthstone. Hearthstone easily do a 40G quest and 3 wins will net you half a booster. This game requires quite a bit more play and time investment to do your quest which give you about 1/4 a booster pack. It also lacks the generous Tavern Brawl rewards & Ranked rewards. I would say currently due to its limited content that earning boosters is about right.Players willing to spend real money will have a significant advantage, as Uncommons, Rares are all clearly and significently more powerful then the weak starting cards.Basic booster only appear to drop 4x common and 1x uncommon card, have yet to get a rare or legendary from 5 booster pack7/10 Interesting concept, with potential			",247,41,4,48,19,3,78

The game is beautifully done and truly enjoyable.10/10			",22,5,0,9,10,0,6

												This game takes a really unique approach to playstyle, where you actually set up your own adventure, overcoming your own cards as well as whatever the opponent throws at you. That way it´s more interactive and actually brings in a good deal of mind games. + Free to play with daily quests that help getting new cards pretty fast. + Easy enough to learn, complex enough to be challenging for competitive players.+ Pretty interactive, usually you have to think about what your opponent is going to do as well as your own game-plan, which I think is rather fun.+ Hero classes don´t really have a pre-defined playstyle but multiple ways to be played.+ Matches are fast-paced, there is not much waiting around.- The community is rather small, making it harder sometimes to find an opponent with matching skill.- Devs don´t communicate well with players (if at all).- Interface could use some upgrades in terms of user-friendliness.

												Played this game a ton in beta. It's pretty good and is a unique in the whole online card game scene. Ignore the reviews complaining about it being ""pay2win"". It's about as pay2win in the sense that Hearthstone or League of Legends is pay2win. You can play to get cards or pay to get cards faster. It's an F2P game, there has to be some source of income and the way Jagex has done it is completely fair. While some of the cards you unpack are great, they are never straight upgrades of cards you get right out of the gate, The majority of the cards you get when you just start out are completely fine and I still use quite a bit of them in my decks. (Example KGP Penguin is a solid card for almost every deck). Anyway, it's a fun game to play when you're doing some online work or just casually watching videos or something. Looking forward to seeing where it goes.			",203,37,2,20,15,1,32

												Great game! I toyed around with Hearthstone briefly because my friends are avid players, but I never really felt all that into it. Chronicle, however, is another story. The gameplay mechanics are unique, and set the game apart from Hearthstone enough for me to become engrossed in it. In addition to this, I can see my Hearthstone fanatic friends finding Chronicle enjoyable, because it has a similiar vibe.On the whole, I think that both those brand new to card games (basically me) and those who play them regularly will find Chronicle fun and super addicting!

												1) Don't believe those who write that it's not interactive game (it is!)2) Dont look on my hrs on record (I have Jagex acc) It's not THE BEST ccg out there but it is defenetly one of those that deserves attention.If you are tired of HS rng like I am and want somthing that is NOT rng based (actually every card game is RNG based because of card draws) and is funny, dont hesitate and download it.  Many write that it's not interactive but I bet that none of them went higher then silver in ranked. Higher ranks are all about sniping, predicting, and bluffing and belive me that it's hell lot of a fun. When you by only one WELL predicted card win game or on the other side when you predict well what opponent will play and counter him, it is sutisfying much more then in any other game (loled many, many,many timese).On higher ranks Linza wont let you barfight or emisary her weapon at the begining of a turn, you have to eather snipe it in the middle or predict that she will play it at the start. It is more chess like thinking game then you would tell.   On this acc I'v won many games with BASIC ONLY cards deck agains those who has fully builded decks so when I read that this game is not interactive all i think is ""This person defenetly doesn't know what is he writing about"" And as I mentioned before, it's not RNG based (except card draws) and for me its a BIG + ",20,3,0,9,0,0,3

												I stumbled across this game looking for something new to waste some time on. Being a free game i had very low expectations, but i must say im impressed.The game it self is a wonderfully change, you control what your character is going to fight, buy, or gain while trying to hurt and one up your oppent for final battle. Its a very difffent system than im use to, but once you get the hang of it its very easily mastered and welcomed change.The Cards and character are very well balanced. Each character has a speacial abilty and deck of cards that can be used to tailior to your play stlye. leaving infinte card and charter combos. And while sometimes a win or loss is based on luck of the draw, you can custom make your decks to counter each charters weakness and expliode thoses of your opponent.Being a free game it issurplisingly not pay to win, paying only gets you new booster packs that may or may not have any good cards in them. Still booster packs can be easily optained without spending real cash. ",52,5,0,20,6,0,9

												Runescape is a game I have been heavily into for ages. When I heard \'Runescape was making a card game\' though, and saw the first few images of it, my first thought was, \""Hearthstone ripoff?\"" Well... I will say this: Aestically, the game has some similarities to Hearthstone. Also, the cards use a similar stat system to Heathstone. But beyond that, however, the game is completely something on it\'s own. Instead of fighting your enemy\'s monsters, you are fighting your OWN monsters, with each card you defeat having either a benifit to your characer, or a hinderance to the enemy\'s character. The goal is to basically make your character the strongest out of the two, or make your oponent lose all their HP before the end of the game. If you are a fan of, or have played Runescape, there is tons of little nods to it, with all the cards being bosses, characters, items, and gear from both modern Runescape, and Oldschool Runescape. However, even if you have not played Runescape before, the game still is more than playable on it\'s own merit.Is it perfect? No. There is a few minor balancing issues here and there, and the game does have a lot of \'luck-based\' moments. However, matches are pretty short, lasting only 5 rounds, gameplay is fairly easy to pick up, and the different characters you can play as all have different playstyles, adding quite a bit of variety to the game. An example? An oponent picks up a weapon card, boosting their attack to 10. The enemy has 10 hp, and deals 10 damage, but gives them some extraordinary bonus for beating it.  So... they would kill the monster in one hit if things go properly, BUT, the moment before they attack the monster, you could play a card that causes their weapon to break, causing them to not be able to kill the monster in one hit... And the monster might just kill them, or leave them severely weak afterwards. Personally, I prefer this game over most other card games, and find myself going to it when I have some free time. Since it is free to play, you might as well try it. I wouldn\'t say everyone will like it, but considering you can get a feel for the game pretty quickly, this is a \'Why not just give it a try?\' type scenerio. I have had a lot of fun with it, and while I feel the game does need more content, I know that will likely come in time.  ",44,9,0,9,3,0,0

												Yes, matchmaking can take a while sometimes, and you'll often get re-matched with the same folks on a given day.But this game is original and interesting, and even if the developer won't be adding add new content to it, what's here is fun for at least a couple hours (and probably a couple dozen hours), even if you don't pay anything for it.  Who cares if it's a little less popular than other similar games?  YOU SHOULD TRY IT.  This genre needs more ideas like this, and what has been done in this game should be more widely known.

												Runescape Legends is a surprise to me as I dislike CCGs. The rules are generally obtuse and the reasoning behind card-placement and synergies usually contrived. I especially grow annoyed by cards that are awesome but only reach potential when you successfully play other cards first while hoping that the opponent doesn't draw cards that dispel your assist-cards and blah, blah, blah. Annoying times two.Runscape Legends is different. Your opponent and you resolve your own cards and the effect of that may or not may damage your opponent and may or not may help you, or indeed the cards may hurt you and help your opponent. If that sounds weird, well that's because it is. However, it makes sense in game as you learn that the cards that you should play depend heavily on the situation of the moment. Sometimes, personally taking damage to strip your opponent of their armor is the right move to take.I suggest to download the game and at least work through the tutorial. The tutorial does a better job of explaining the concept than I do.The game is F2P and the model is not entirely benign. Your startingcards are weak and while the game rewards singular cards and even basic boosterpacks, they come too few and far between to stay competitive. Someone who buys the 50 boosterpacks bundle will blindfoldedly blow you away, because the truly devastating cards are in the basic boosterpacks.What are truly devastating cards? Those are the cards aimed at a specific hero, which play on the strenghts of your given hero. Usually, these cards can only be played when a condition is met but with some smart deckbuilding it is possible to field 20DMG+ cards in the second round and in so doing taking away more than 60% of your opponents health in the early game!Yes, in the game's defense it is possible to grind your way to greatness but the schism between a buyer and a rube is most notably there, which makes this F2P game decidedly P2W.Positively in the game's advantage are it's colorful graphics, fun gameplay idea, nailbiting battles when you're lucky to battle another rube and the joy of gaining cards and boosterpacks without spending a dime. Since the game is overly stacked against rubes, this is where the challenge lies. A buyer will be insta-pwnage, winning because they dropped money, not because they came up through the school of hard knocks.It's not their fault, it's because the developers thought that this model works best for them. You can't fault a buyer for using the options available to them, even though a rube must be lucky to have won exceptional cards to be able to stand up to a buyer. Smart deckbuilding only takes you so far, afterall.I think that this a fun game I will play for some time to come. At least until the buyers have chased all the rubes off. Jump in now before playing the F2P becomes pointless and milk some free hours of fun out of it before it is too late.			",92,44,4,52,36,2,13

												A new take on card games!There's alot of good and bad about this game, but overall it's a very addictive experience that doesn't take itself too seriously. There're quite a few cards, but due to most(as you'll find out eventually) are usually bound to a certain character's deck the game might become very stale eventually.Pros:->Looks decent and runs well->Quality artwork and sound design->Playable without actually having to pay->Extremely well suited for a casual game->Easy to understandCons:->Inevitable and very large RNG factor->May be incredibly frustrating at times as RNG might completely destroy you without being able to do anything in certain matches->Pocket warriors are at a pretty clear advantage as almost all of the devestating combos and counter cards are not part of your standard deck->Very long waiting times due to the opponent having poor ping->Very personal complaint, but I think the RNG factor is too large for this game to be suited for the competitive sceneOverall I would give this game a 7 out 10 ",36,4,1,5,4,1,6

												Ive been playing Chronicle since closed beta, so add about 8-10 hours on to my total playtime since it *just* released on steam. I play this game fairly casually and its a pretty solid card game.ProsRuneScape Theme (brownie points because I play RS)The character is the focus (currently 5 characters from RuneScape lore)Great ArtMatches are quick (At most 5-8 minutes average for me)Deck building is fun (Very similar to Hearthstone)ConsCan feel grindyCurrency takes a while to get (Do your daily challenges and AI Battles for some free packs)You can feel like you cheated out of a win if you get 2nd turn (after 5 turns your characters fight)Nobody currently plays Dungeoneering (Kinda like the endless mode from Hearthstone)All in all it is a fantastic game that you can play for one or two games and not have to completely focus. If you are a Hearthstone player, I hope that you can try it out and look past its similarities to Hearthstone, they are totally different games. I highly reccomend it.

												Don't get me wrong, I love this game. It's just that it is hugely unbalanced based on whether you go first or second.I can't count the amount of times that I would win, if only I was first. Whether it's in the last fight (which it matters hugely) to get in that extra attack or whether it's to heal up on the first action of a chapter to stop your opponent one-shotting you.I think the game is great but the amount of times I've been dicked over by being second and not first is one of the only things that will turn me away from the game			",51,6,0,12,8,1,5

												I love the concept of the game and the gameplay that I've been able to play was quite well thought out, engaging and fun. But as it is, I can't progress in he game. I beat the first tow NPC's in the solo campaign. Every time I try to initiate the third npc in battle, the game crashes. Every. Single. Time.Even more frustrating, the game goes into an Error Loop when this crash happens, forcing you to close steam through your task manager, and then to reboot steam as a whole.I've read that thhis isn't so much an issue if you get the game from jagex through their downloader, but what's the point in having it on steam if it's just going to cause issues for steam users? I might try downloading the game a second time using the downloader, just because the game is fun to play in short bursts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good Game when it works. Servers go down constantly without warning. Game is unstable. The game is riddled with bugs and is written poorly without online play being considered. If you drop a single packet the game will crash and you will lose - Because its too hard for some people to learn how to code games effectively. Drop a packet in hearthstone, hex, mtgo, spellweaver - and you're fine. All these games let you return to play because experienced programmers. In Runescape Legends -> the game will constantly bug and freeze as their is no redundancy built in. The second something goes wrong you are restarting the game fully - every single time - and losing progress.The issues stated above have been present since 2015 and are not scheduled to be fixed - nor does the developer consider it problematic. Good game minus the developer.			",50,10,0,16,1,0,10

												I cannot recommend this game at it's current state.In the first few hours the games was indeed fun to play, however, the gameplay itself gets repetitive rather quickly and the only goal that keeps you playing is getting new card decks.At some point you realize that you only keep playing to get new cards, only you will only think about the next time you get those 1000 coins so you could try and get some decent new cards.At the moment there are only 5 characters (more will be added in the near future probably), that give you new cards / gems / gold every 5 levels or so that you advance with them (every character progresses in levels seperately).Eventually, it becomes NEARLY IMPOSSIBLY to keep getting bonuses by leveling up after you reach level 15, at which point, you're going to hit a pay-wall, EXTREMELY HARD, ""Why?"" do you ask? because of the horrible crafting system:Every card you wanna 'craft' also requires gems to craft it (you get these by leveling up or by using real money to purchase), not only stones (Ruby, Emerald, Diamond, Sapphire) that are 'easy' to get for free.You will realize by then that if you wanna keep up with the other players you HAVE to pay some real money.You are also faced with an option to enter a dungeon for 1300 gold if i'm not mistaken, where you have to choose between 2 random characters to play and you are given random cards from which you have to choose to build a deck to enter the dungeon with to face other players, now, there's a HUGE problem with this set-up, sometimes the cards you will get can be GARBAGE or ones that simply dont coop with each other well.That will leave you with minus 1300 gold wondering ""Why did I just not pay 1000 gold to buy a new deck instead of gambling?""All in all, a fun game for a few hours ONLY and then you will get bored and hit the pay-wall, HARD.

												I've had a lot of fun playing this game. I had also recently downloaded Hearthstone and the MTG game but this is the one I keep coming back to. I haven't paid for any card packs and just by playing I usually earn about 1 a day through the in-game currency. By leveling up characters and a few other such things there is the abbility to earn I think 8 free packs too. The game has unique game play where each player chooses 4 cards to play at a time and then the game goes through each card in turn. It is a lot of fun when you can correctly anticipate the opponents move and counter.			",42,7,0,8,4,0,7

												If you remember an old game that is still hanging around but wasn\'t as successful beyond card form - this is similar to Magic the Gathering. Slight difference is any players of Rune Scape will recognize all settings, legends, card are taken directly from another great game by Jagex.You choose a legend from a group of 5. Each with unique card decks for spells/abilities/creatures.Games are divided in to 5 chapters. 4 cards per chapter can be played. After that if both legends remain standing, a deathmatch takes place based on attack level and health/armor.The objective of old remains consistant. Reduce your opponent\'s health to 0 before your own life force is drained.Plenty of in-game and Steam achievements makes this a while to complete all challenges. Daily quests also add to the benefits of meeting goals to buy more card packs. Then there is the pay-to-win aspect as well where you can buy card packs or get custom skins for a cosmetic unique card-backing that your opponent will see during games.You also earn badges and titles to make your account more custom.Overall for the price you can\'t beat it. A fully free game where you can max everything without paying a penny.			",217,26,2,11,5,2,7

												If you're looking for a new and different way to play a CCG, this is one of the best. Playing against your own deck is a really fun way to play. Each class feels different and can play several different strategies. It's really fun to craft a deck and see how it fares. A nice addition that I like is the set of challenges that you can complete that often require a deck to be built to support it, which can provide both a deckbuilding idea and a fun challenge to complete. It's also fairly easy to get into the game. Beause of the daily quests' rewards, a card pack can be earned about every 2 or 3 days, plus an extra every week. The quests are easy enough to complete, and can be easily completed every day. Overall, it's definitely worth trying out if you're curious.			",12,2,0,4,2,0,5

												Great idea. I will give it more time but so far my biggest concern is the stupid animations. So much time wasted to watch the same stupid board get laid down. It has no purpose and adds nothing to the game. Also there are 5 stages and each time the 2 heroes meet and then.... disappear. Back to the same board layout animation trash. We will see if this slow nonsense doesn't stop me from playing the game.... but I think it already has.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DISCLAIMERI have had the pleasure of playing this game since the opening of closed beta months ago. It did't take long to realise that this was a very unique and visceral take on the generic card games being released recently. This game takes place in the Runescape universe and as such uses this rich history and lore as a base for the game's cards and characters. If you have no prior experience with Runescape don't let this scare you away, as I myself have't played Runescape in over 5 years, and I still understood everything the game had to offer. I generally held a hatred towards card games, seeing them as a boring timesink for nerds to jack off to, but this game at the very least made me a fan of the genre.The gameplay of this game is vastly different to the offerings of other card games such as Heathstone. In Chronicle you will see yourself pitted against your opponent, racing through exciting maps towards the final fight at the end. It is this chase and race format which allows Chronicle to be so fun and engaging. You can visibly see your opponent's character on the map, moving along side yours, each of you collecting and using cards to beef up for the fight at the end. Figuring out plans and foiling your enemies is a critical part of the game, and makes every match unique and full of conniving trickery.So far I have not personally had an issue with the amount of cards available.  As I have said, I'm not a huge fan of card games, so I really have no comparison to which I can compare Chronicle, but rest assured that the reward system does keep your deck fresh and different enough. On your arrival into the game you will have access to only a few characters. Each character has their own set of unique cards, in addition to the mass of cards that can be used globally between differing characters. To unlock new characters you simply have to defeat them, this can be done online or through the offline missions (these are just matches against a bot on differing difficulties). Decks are fully customisable and you can create as many as you like, so each match you can pick the one you feel would be best for you. What I really loved about the game was the fact each character is so different. The play and feel of each one is massive, meaning depending on who you're playing as, you will be using different tactics. At the end of each match you are rewarded with experience points. These allow you to level up your character, which in turn unlocks new cards for that character. This means that you can spend a lot of time levelling each hero up, adding to the replayability of the game. The monetisation of this game is ok. There's really not much to say about it. You can go through the whole thing without paying a penny, and still beat people who have splashed an insane amount of cash on the game. All real money can do is buy card packs and skins for your cards and nametag. Card packs can be obtained through ingame money rewarded for playing the game, so I really don't see an issue here. Skins can also be obtained through achievements, so yet again, this is not an issue.Overall the game offers a solid experience different enough from similar titles that it stands out to be its own game. Unlike Hearthstone and its knockoffs it does not conform to the rules laid out by Blizzard, and instead has become its own exciting blend of genres that 'should' make it a very popular game.

												I've played Runescape for around 8 and a half years. Personally, I've always wanted a spin-off Runescape action-RPG or dungeon crawler, but nonetheless I got ahold of the little strategy game, and I was pleasantly surprised.The game is well-polished, well-paced, and has some nice variety. I'm hoping they add more characters to play as later, as each character you play has its own strengths and weaknesses.The game looks pretty good. Aesthetically, the storybook/Runescape graphics merge very well. Also, it runs smooth and feels very slick and well done.I'm recommending this game, especially considering it is a free game.

												PROS :-Free.-Totally unique mechanic (different than Magic/Hearthstone). Essentialy you try to strategize to get your hero to have the most gold/armor/weapon so in the end you can dominate the opponent's hero.CONS (from a point of view of someone who spent quite a lot of time in Hearthstone) :-Each match does not feel as exciting as a Hearthstone's match, because I can't quickly respond to what the opponent is doing (basically not as interactive as Hearthstone/Magic).-The duration of each match can feel longer than a Hearthstone match (most likely not true but it feels that way) because each turn/chapter feels longer than one turn in Hearthstone.-Was not that impress with it's visual.CONCLUSION :It's free, so give it a try you might like it (especialy if you don't like or never played Hearthstone/Magic).

												I have played so many digital card games and a lot of them feel very clone like. But this is not one of them. The play feels more like a board game than a card game to be honest. It is kind of hard to explain but you are playing as much against your own deck as you are against your opponent. I'm bad at detailed explanations of game mechanics, sorry for that, but I'm sure there are other reviews that lay it out in technical terms. I'll just promise you that it is in fact fun.    I find this games aesthetics to be very nice but rather limited. Hopefully there will be more variety later but whats there right now looks great. My only complaint is that while the starter decks are easily obtained in a short time the boosters feel kind of grindy to get through play and the card shops booster prices are more or less on par with every other ccg and tcg all of which I think are somewhat overpriced but hey at least its just on par. If you have played other games like this you know what kind of pricing to expect. Anyway this game is an enjoyable little twist on an old genre and is a bit of a breath of fresh air so yeah I'd say give it a go, and have fun guys!			",105,29,1,58,13,3,56

												Most card games nowadays use the same game mechanism - you use minion or unit cards to stay on the board and fight the enemy, you use spell cards with different effects and maybe you have weapon cards and other types of cards, while relying heavily on RNG. This game is something very different though - it does have weapon cards and unit cards etc. but the rules here are different. Opponents don't face eachother in the way they would in other card games. And thanks to this the result of each match is less dependent on RNG and more dependent on outwitting your rival by making a good strategy. Card draw is of course the reason RNG can't be ignored but this game actually requires more than simple deck building and RNG. I don't know if this is the first game of this kind but it is certainly the first of it that I have played and I am enjoying it pretty much. It is a good break from the tedium of Hearthstone and thanks to its uniqueness it is one of the only two card games I can actually play without getting bored by just glancing in their direction. I highly recommend it to people who find regular CCGs/TCGs boring.			",15,3,0,3,2,0,0

												Note that my playtime in this game does not reflect my experience with it - i have played quite a lot of the beta when it was available.This is a strategic card game in the theme of RuneScape. You may think ""wow, another Hearthstone clone??"" Well, let me be the first to tell you that's where you're wrong. Chronicles has an unique playstyle, something i haven't seen in other card games.The focus in this game is building you own character - getting higher attack stat, get armor, and all the while you're doing this, your end goal is to beat your opponent in a glorious duel at the end of five turns. You are not directly battling against your opponent until the end, the exception being the odd card here and there. This makes the game stand out from other strategic card games.The game has great visuals that fits it's overall theme, and satisfying sound design. The game includes soundtracks from RuneScape, and they are all very nice. For people familiar with RuneScape or not, the game is just as easy to pick up for both. I would say the game is easy to learn, but hard to master.My only pet peeve about this game is the amount of time it takes to progress and get new cards/items. I know it's supposed to be slow so people are encouraged to buy packs, but it would be reasonable to speed it up a little. I have no problems with microtransactions in this game, they are all reasonable.I would highly recommend you have a little try. I've never liked the strategic card game type games, but this game is a great exception to that. Try it even if you don't like these kinds of games, you  might be positively surprised!Have fun :)			",172,23,2,15,15,2,26

												Chronicle: RuneScape Legends is a CCG that sets itself apart from many games of the same genre. The game focuses on building a deck for your hero to fight rather than building a deck to fight your opponent with. The goal of the game is to survive the journey through all 5 chapters of the match and then fight your opponent, however there are many cards that can be used to debuff your rival and screw up their plan. This game is truly a unique gem among a genre that rarely sees much innovation.If you would like to see the game in more detail, here is my video for it:

												I have played so many digital card games and a lot of them feel very clone like. But this is not one of them. The play feels more like a board game than a card game to be honest. It is kind of hard to explain but you are playing as much against your own deck as you are against your opponent. I'm bad at detailed explanations of game mechanics, sorry for that, but I'm sure there are other reviews that lay it out in technical terms. I'll just promise you that it is in fact fun.    I find this games aesthetics to be very nice but rather limited. Hopefully there will be more variety later but whats there right now looks great. My only complaint is that while the starter decks are easily obtained in a short time the boosters feel kind of grindy to get through play and the card shops booster prices are more or less on par with every other ccg and tcg all of which I think are somewhat overpriced but hey at least its just on par. If you have played other games like this you know what kind of pricing to expect. Anyway this game is an enjoyable little twist on an old genre and is a bit of a breath of fresh air so yeah I'd say give it a go, and have fun guys!			",105,29,1,58,13,3,56

												After looking at the positive reviews I decided to give this game a chance. I play and love the MMORPG Runecape, but you don't have to know anything about the game to play this gem. Though, you'll recognize the names and terms if you do. Anyway, like most free games there is a distinct advantage given to players who shell out money to buy the premium stuff. However, this does not necessarily make them invincible. As far as I can tell, the premium items only allow you to get more cards, which you can unlock in the game on your own, albeit VERY slowly compared to just straight-up buying the cards. Also, you can't buy specific cards. You can only buy booster packs which have random cards (kind of like trading cards irl). Even when you play against other players and they have better cards than you, a lot of the game is based on chance, so you can still have a good chance of winning against them. Playing against other players is the only real way to level up in the game (and leveling up is the only free way of unlocking more cards and content), but if you don't like facing other players you can always just play against the computer on 3 different difficulties. The hardest difficulty (gold) will resemble pvp difficulty. Try the game out, it's free after all! It has good replay value and is always getting updated so you'll be able to enjoy more content as time goes on.			",42,6,0,11,3,0,4

												As far as card games go, Chronicle:Runescape is unique enough to hold its own with any of them. The card art is decidedly similar to Hearthstone, but that is where the similarities end.  The game quite obviously lives within the Runescape universe and brings with it a huge chunk of lore and the lovable soundtrack as well. As others have said this game plays nothing like hearthstone or any other card game that I have played so far.  The gameplay  revolves around adventuring through your deck, with a final confrontation with your oponent at the end. You may clash along the way, but the final confrontation is often the deciding factor.  It is up to you to \'level up\' your stats along the way.			",94,18,3,20,15,0,8

												Neat game. Couldn't make purchases through Steam, so I created an account through the official website, and then had no issue with any purchases. The game itself is cool. I do find it interesting, that no matter what strategy I tried, the computer A.I. had an answer for it. It was very convenient for the A.I. to have heals right after I would use spells to damage it. No spells, then the A.I. would counter my trying to ""debuff"" it, by guess what? Having MORE BUFFS ready AFTEr my ""debuffs' were used up! Still, i played the game til i got my mage to level 7, and I stopped. Not a big fan of playing other people, and this game lacks in content for solo players! I can play the A.I. and unlock 3 different level's of A.I. difficulty, but that's it. At least Hearthstone has it's ""adventures"" for solo players to play. In time, this game will probably add something similar. One complaint I do have... is the lack of info on the different cards, and what all of the different bold lettered effects mean. Plus,,you really don't have a clue when you get a ""rare"" card since it doesn't alert you to it like Hearthstone does. Also.. I had some graphical issues playing it through Steam. When the resolution was set to the highest, the ""info box"" thingey would be visible on the top right of my screen. switching to a lower resolution removed it. Playing through the game's official website, I didn't have this issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DISCLAIMERI have had the pleasure of playing this game since the opening of closed beta months ago. It did't take long to realise that this was a very unique and visceral take on the generic card games being released recently. This game takes place in the Runescape universe and as such uses this rich history and lore as a base for the game's cards and characters. If you have no prior experience with Runescape don't let this scare you away, as I myself have't played Runescape in over 5 years, and I still understood everything the game had to offer. I generally held a hatred towards card games, seeing them as a boring timesink for nerds to jack off to, but this game at the very least made me a fan of the genre.The gameplay of this game is vastly different to the offerings of other card games such as Heathstone. In Chronicle you will see yourself pitted against your opponent, racing through exciting maps towards the final fight at the end. It is this chase and race format which allows Chronicle to be so fun and engaging. You can visibly see your opponent's character on the map, moving along side yours, each of you collecting and using cards to beef up for the fight at the end. Figuring out plans and foiling your enemies is a critical part of the game, and makes every match unique and full of conniving trickery.So far I have not personally had an issue with the amount of cards available.  As I have said, I'm not a huge fan of card games, so I really have no comparison to which I can compare Chronicle, but rest assured that the reward system does keep your deck fresh and different enough. On your arrival into the game you will have access to only a few characters. Each character has their own set of unique cards, in addition to the mass of cards that can be used globally between differing characters. To unlock new characters you simply have to defeat them, this can be done online or through the offline missions (these are just matches against a bot on differing difficulties). Decks are fully customisable and you can create as many as you like, so each match you can pick the one you feel would be best for you. What I really loved about the game was the fact each character is so different. The play and feel of each one is massive, meaning depending on who you're playing as, you will be using different tactics. At the end of each match you are rewarded with experience points. These allow you to level up your character, which in turn unlocks new cards for that character. This means that you can spend a lot of time levelling each hero up, adding to the replayability of the game. The monetisation of this game is ok. There's really not much to say about it. You can go through the whole thing without paying a penny, and still beat people who have splashed an insane amount of cash on the game. All real money can do is buy card packs and skins for your cards and nametag. Card packs can be obtained through ingame money rewarded for playing the game, so I really don't see an issue here. Skins can also be obtained through achievements, so yet again, this is not an issue.Overall the game offers a solid experience different enough from similar titles that it stands out to be its own game. Unlike Hearthstone and its knockoffs it does not conform to the rules laid out by Blizzard, and instead has become its own exciting blend of genres that 'should' make it a very popular game.

												If you're looking for a new and different way to play a CCG, this is one of the best. Playing against your own deck is a really fun way to play. Each class feels different and can play several different strategies. It's really fun to craft a deck and see how it fares. A nice addition that I like is the set of challenges that you can complete that often require a deck to be built to support it, which can provide both a deckbuilding idea and a fun challenge to complete. It's also fairly easy to get into the game. Beause of the daily quests' rewards, a card pack can be earned about every 2 or 3 days, plus an extra every week. The quests are easy enough to complete, and can be easily completed every day. Overall, it's definitely worth trying out if you're curious.			",12,2,0,4,2,0,5

												RuneScape Legends is an interesting game. You have multiple classes with different play styles. The concept is nice as I did have fun watching my 'hero' go about racing against the enemy as they slew monsters, bought items, and of course paid/killed someone to hurt my enemy.The base value or 'interaction' with the game is great... but not so much when you try to advance.Single player mode... that's to test decks. You can earn and win a couple of coins in the character unlock matches against the AI which also shows and unlocks the other heroes you can play as which can also net you two to three packs depending on your luck and your decks. The campagin will earn you a card, but VS is were it's mostly at.To level up your character you need to fight someone else. To earn gold on your daily quests you need to fight other people. You earn money if you win, but you earn some experience if you lose... so get ready to lose a lot. Card packs share Heartstone's formula which means extra cards are grinded into dust which are then used to craft the card you want. It isn't that bad considering a good hand , semi-descent deck and planning can do a lot but getting to the 'semi-descent' deck is the hard part.To earn gold you need to win or loss a lot while hoping your quest doesn't require you to actually win a fight otherwise you already lost that gold. You can spend cash to buy packs, but a few packs won't cut it so your going to need to spend a bit or a lot more money if you want to win and earn gold.Steam workshop seems to be a great idea as playing around with some of those ideas or making new single player quests to test your luck against or try to get a fair challange against is a wonderful idea... I just hope that the fix some of the issues as having to lose constantly just to 'level up' your hero enough to get some cards and see if you are luck in your dailys to earn some gold can be very frustrating.If your willing to fork over some cash during this christmass sale than you'll be in luck. Otherwise... download the game and try getting your log in rewards until you get enough to make a semi-descent deck. I know magic the gather is loved for it's easier to collect all the cards method... but the fighting an AI and getting some gold and level up everytime you fight might be needed to be brought over here... even if it's only ten or twenty gold.Packs cost 1,000 gold mind you.So for right now... it's an interesting game, but what you can do is limited by your luck on packs and your wallet if you want to do PVP where a descent chunk of the gold comes in. So it's more of a 'Pay to Start' then take it from there. Hopefully they'll fix the issue sooner rather than later.			",78,25,1,35,8,1,25

Its a shame that the player base has dropped in recent months but when I do rarely find someone on Casual its always fun. There are still some cards that are OP (like 2 Surges in a row and certain monsters) but hey its a work in progress.Solid 8/10Pros: wide variety of cards/charactersroom for improvement and more decksThe strategy is off the chain!Cons: Matchmaking is sketchy, unless its RankedThe AI in single player campaign is freaking impossiblePeople only tend to use 2 characters insead of the ones they dont want to learn			",52,2,0,9,2,0,12

												I've played Runescape for around 8 and a half years. Personally, I've always wanted a spin-off Runescape action-RPG or dungeon crawler, but nonetheless I got ahold of the little strategy game, and I was pleasantly surprised.The game is well-polished, well-paced, and has some nice variety. I'm hoping they add more characters to play as later, as each character you play has its own strengths and weaknesses.The game looks pretty good. Aesthetically, the storybook/Runescape graphics merge very well. Also, it runs smooth and feels very slick and well done.I'm recommending this game, especially considering it is a free game.

												PROS :-Free.-Totally unique mechanic (different than Magic/Hearthstone). Essentialy you try to strategize to get your hero to have the most gold/armor/weapon so in the end you can dominate the opponent's hero.CONS (from a point of view of someone who spent quite a lot of time in Hearthstone) :-Each match does not feel as exciting as a Hearthstone's match, because I can't quickly respond to what the opponent is doing (basically not as interactive as Hearthstone/Magic).-The duration of each match can feel longer than a Hearthstone match (most likely not true but it feels that way) because each turn/chapter feels longer than one turn in Hearthstone.-Was not that impress with it's visual.CONCLUSION :It's free, so give it a try you might like it (especialy if you don't like or never played Hearthstone/Magic).

												This is innovative and really fun! And i can't really say ""I'm surprised to see a good game coming from Jagex!"", cause to be honest, Runescape was a good game way back when it was popular, it just fails now because there's no use trying to polish a rotten apple, it might look fresh, but it'll leave a bad aftertaste.It's a good card game anyway. Loving it to bits! And also, the music is nice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good CCG. Not P2W or P2P. Just play for fun and youll unlock packs or get coppers to buy some. Neverplayed RunescapePlayed a lot TCG in real life before internet made them CCG. Played couples of CCG but never spend a dime on packs. Why? because it is not tradable! THE GAME:The Mechanic is unlike anything i ever seen. 30 cards deck, 5 rounds, 4 slots to play cards each round. You battle your own creature wich in return give you ressources or other effects wich helps you or hinder your opponent.  At the end of round 5 you get a final showdown, better get your blades sharpen. The strategies and tricks you can make in this game are awesome. I winned ( and failed ) so many times by anticipating ( or not) the opponent moves. The one i like to use is steal opponent gold so he doesnt have enough to pay for his upcoming weapon then gets beaten by his own monster! :D You can break oppenents weapon, you can boost opponents monsters, you can bypass the armor with some cards etc... it's pretty neat and and the time i am writing this i still have to get my and on my first rare\epic card. (which are ruby and diamond cards)The games or not very long since it is limited to the 5 rounds but somtimes i wish i could skip animations or at least wish it could be a little faster but it is a great game. for free!

												The game is fun and intresting.But the randomness of draws is worse than in heartstone.You have 30 card minimum,without accounting for excess  card draws that gives you 4*3 cards during the 5 phases.Thats 18 cards that you can play out of your deck,(if you can afford or kill them).Giving you 12 dead cards.Sometimes you wont see certain card for 5 games,making it difficult to use certain card combos,wich may further reduce the cards you can play if you opt for combo kills.In arena,you may get choices between cards you cant activate,afford or kill (geting 8 turns of high atk/def monsters and spells,with no gold gaining options,making it hard to pick anything with not knowing if its a dead card),even if you look back at the card choices you had at the last turn of draft.Even using the premade decks,you may often end up with nothing to play just because of rng But because its a 5 turn game each turn is important and loosing the first stage or second to rng is certain defeat.If you dont mind the defeats that have nothing to do with skill or have above average luck in theese types of games,then go for it.It is worth playing.But the excess dependence on the order, that the cards are dealt to you makes it to much of a roulete			",6,2,0,0,0,0,3

												From all the digital CCG's ive ever played, that take themselves more serious than Facebook- and Browser-Games, this one takes the price for being the most greedy, most pay2win!While rewards are tiny, prices for boosters are cheap, and there was a long closed beta before the game got officialy released.With the result, that everybody either had a big collection when the game started (the forum-fanboys that will tell you that you can easily compete without spending money), had to buy a shitl0ad of boosters to get to a competitive level, or just bought boosters, because the first couple of games against the AI were fun, and because they are cheaper than in Hearthstone and similiar games. (Which, of course, is compensated by the worst and least generous reward-system i've ever seen).And now, a month after official release, everybody plays high-end-decks in ranked already, and without spending MUCH money, dont even dream about being able to play competitively...As a free player, this game is just frustrating, because doing nothing but feeding the payers is not exactly entertaining...In the end, Chronicle is just another f2p money-grab, that was designed around a CCG with a popular theme, in hope to attract customers, and i cannot recommend it, at all.

												This game can be interesting for several hours, but after that you'll start to experienced bugs and constant disconnections.If you are in a match vs player and got disconnected, the game will try to reconnect just for a few seconds and then will go to main screen and it is not possible to reconnect to game, also you need to restart the game, because it will stuck on main menu.Ranking syster is copied from Hearthstone with a little tweaks (they made is worse).Game packs and Dungeoneering mode (Arena) has almost the same price as in Hearthstone.Cards in this game needs heavy balance, there is a lot of unfair and unbalanced cards. Especially it affect Dungeoneering mode, completely unbalanced experience.RNG is affecting the game even more that Hearthstone, basicaly if Hearthstone is 80% RNG based game, this one is 85-90% RNG. Also a player that start first has advantage over other player.Crafting system is even more greedy than in Hearthstone. In HS legendary card disenchanting - 400, craft - 1600 (4 times more), in RSL dinenchanting - 600, crafting  - 3000 (5 times more), now who is more greedy?Graphics is nice and soft, not so much toxic colors, has very simple design. Animations is slow, time consuming, you'll like it at the start, but after seeing it more than 100 times you'll wish to skip all of that, especially when the battle finished. They should do it in a way to show everething in 1 page.Soundtrack is very relaxing, this is one of the few great things in this game.Overall the game is far from being finished, a lot of tweaks and improvements needs to be done. But I recommend to try this game at least. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												not bad seems fun pretty easy to play similar to herthstone in how you get card packs and the arena but really a very differnt way to play the game you play up to 20 cards  that your legend has to kill or pay for the effect to happen during the game then your heros/legends fight you can play for the early game ko or just build up and play for the legend fight it seems card packs are not that hard to get early on but after you level everyone up it will probably be just about the same pace as herthstone but really a great game.

												NOT A HEARTHSTONE KNOCKOFF!!This is a very unique card game based on Runescape. This game does not rely on RGN, for you have 4 tiles per round and those tiles can have cards placed down on them. These cards are randomly given, but you place them down and then fight them as you move along the battle scene. You fight monsters, pick up loot, gain or lose defence/strength/health points. Forward thinking is just as important as the curren situation. This is a strategy game. Though after the scenes are complete, you finally face the other player in a final battle. With each player taking hits at eachother untill the first person's health drops to 0. This is why gaining Strength, Defence, and Health is so important. Truely a unique card game, is it not?I've played this game since Close Beta when it was not on steam (Hence my low amount of hours) and I can tell you it was crafted with love and care. Carefully planned out and balanced. All while keeping the fans of Runescape in mind. With each Adventurer brining a new playstyle and a new strategy to counter/play. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has freetime on their mobile phone. Though the mobile version has not been released yet, so in the meantime play it on the computer. :)			",55,2,0,7,11,0,33

												This is free-to-play, puzzle / strategy game:The game is unique and hard to describe. You play against AI or a human.You are kind of in a race, across 5 maps, against your opponent. There are 4 pit-stops per map, at which point you perform actions, depending on the random cards that you draw. The goal is to reduce your opponent's life from 30 to zero.Fast forward to 3 minutes into the video because it's preamble and some of it is outdated:

												All I can say is NetDecking. Almost every one net decks, and there are very few true good deck builders. Fun game, poor meta game. Too small card pool for variety of good decks. Rather wait until the pool is bigger. Fortuently you can just straight concede when you see a net deck and move on if you are money grinding. Competetively you will get super bored quickly by running into the same old strat over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												     I'll admit, when I began playing, I had expected something of a Hearthstone type TCG. But what I got was something nicely refreshing in comparison. Chronicle: RuneScape Legends, is both unique, and most definitly inspired by Hearthstone, but despite this I feel it has enough to offer that there is a clear distinction.     The game itself is still in that awkward, ""I'm a new born game."" kinda phase, so it's hard not to feel frustrated during the intial time you spend playing the game... although once you get the hang of it (which only took me about half an hour), you quickly start bubbling up with ideas for decks, and premises that you want to look into.     But the big thing for me, was the fact that RNG seemed ... ""fair"". During the game, I felt like not only me but both sides had the potential to screw eachother up. Normally you play your cards in response to eachothers actions, or somthing along those lines... but from what I've played thus far, it's more like you are setting up ""potential"" responses to what ""could"" happen. So it's always fun to see what hilarity ensues, and who knows, perhaps you'll both try to kill each other indirectly, or spend an entire turn buffing up. There's always an air of mystery, and a sense of strategy, thats quite enjoyable.     I probably won't stop playing Hearthstone anytime soon for this, but for those times when I take a break, I think this would be the perfect change of pace. 8/10 - ""Good game! Definitly worth giving a shot!""			",60,7,0,10,12,0,5

												It's not a ""pay to win"" game, but it is a bit less new player friendly than say, Hearthstone. There are things that can only be countered by cards that are not included by the basic set. Now this game is very different from Hearthstone except tha they're both virtual card games, but there the similarity ends!... Ok, they're similiar in that you're trying to win both too.That said, it's still tons of fun. And how you catch up is you do dungeoneering. Do not spend any copper on packs, only do dungeoneering, if you want to spend real money on it (I will admit I dropped the starter pack $8 on it) don't spend it on packs, spend it on dungeoneering. Three wins will make you break even, more will get you far better rewards, crystals (dust to Hearthstone players.) I will also say that it is a lot easier to make a decent dungeon deck than a decent arena deck.Though that said, the game is not quite as well balanced as say Hearthstone, as the rarer cards are simply better than non-rare ones in about 90% of the situations.

I am incredibly excited for the future now to see what else Jagex will be able to come up with and make other games in the RS universe (maybe like a RTS or MOBA). I have enjoyed the crap out of the game so far and I haven't spent a dime, only thing I dislike is the lack of cards for Free to Play but maybe spending a few dollars here or there every month won't be such a bad thing.

												 Chronicle: Runescape legends is a good game. I reviewed back during its closed beta and its even better now. The gameplay is fast paced and the visuals are very nice for a strategy card game. If you have ever been a runescape player many of the cards, settings and heros will be familiar. One of the best things about this game is that its not overly complicated. The strategy of each hero and the game mechanics are easy to learn but challenging to master. Deck building is also pretty simple. I've seen a few reviews that say this game is pay 2 win and a hearthstone rip off. Its neither of those things and those reviews are not accurate. It doesn't matter how many card packs you buy if you don't know how or when to play your cards.All around its a good game I'd give it a strong8/10			",65,3,6,8,18,0,10

The only thing I think needs to get better is some of the artstyle of the cards, some of the ""legendary"" cards dont really give the feeling that these are rare cards. Besides that, I am in love with the game and it is something I think everybody should try.			",84,13,3,7,5,0,15

												I personally when I saw this game being announced I was like oh god another Hearthstone clone...Hearthstones already bad enough of a game how much worse can this one be? I ate my words so quickly about this game, It's so unique and interesting. 0 RNG except for drawing your cards which is a huge step above hearthstone. Very strategic in your five chapters and it makes it feel like a little adventure. I love the music, clan wars makes me feel nostalgic and the gameplay is very solid. My only gripe with this game is the dungeoneering/ Arena mode. My first draft was free but the cards I was given were absolutely unplayable. I think the card selection system should be tweaked so that your deck has some sort of synergy with what you choose in the very beginning.			",17,1,1,2,0,0,1

												A very surprising game! I am a huge fan of card games like Magic The Gathering and Heartstone and, after being slightly disappointed by the beta of Elder Scrolls Legend for being not a huge improvement over the second, I was kind of sceptic when I head of this game. Boy how am I happy to be wrong!If you think it is another Heartstone clone, think again! This is a nice spin on the genre and it is easy to learn and hard to master.In this game you have to move your hero to 5 boards and place cards that can affect his value, like attack, life, armour and so on.It requires a quite ammount of strategy depending on the character you choose and make sure you have gather enough resources to defeat your opponent either during the game or in a final duel at the end of the fifth board.There is a good single player mode that can help you learn the basic and what strategy works with each character, other than, as you do in Heartstone, level up them in order to receive more cards for your deck.If you like the card games and you want something to play alongside the most famous one, download this.

												Did you play runescape when you were 10? Did you also play it when you were 15, 18, and even sometimes in your 20's? If you enjoy strategy games at all, then this game is for you. It is a fun, fast-paced strategy card game with the greatest video game theme of all time. How could you go wrong?I've barely dipped into the game, about 4 hours so far, but I really, really enjoy what I have seen and played. The multiplayer is challenging, and a lot more competitive than I thought it would be at first glance, plus any card collecting game is addicting in my book. I plan on playing this one a lot more in the future, especially as summer approaches and school lets out for a while. This game will definitely be eating some of the time I would have been using on SMITE instead, which says a lot.The one thing I am a little concerned about is the freemium aspect of the game. It is difficult to unlock new packs (unless you shell out money, then it is unlimited), so developing your deck could be very time consuming and frustrating as the game goes on. It's never fun to lose to a player who paid his way to victory, but it's hard to avoid in a game like this sometimes. We shall see if it develops into more of an issue in the future.Review: 9/10 so far, excited to see what kind of updates and game mechanics come in the future, -1 point for allowing freemium turds to pay for cards and ruin a few early matches, but otherwise awesome. You can't beat the price of free either. Check it out!! You won't regret it.			",39,2,0,5,1,0,1

												A very refreshing original twist of a card game, especially for those who have played so many MTG type imitations. Fun active colorful graphics that keep you on the edge of your seat, breathless to see what your enemy comes up with next, and how your cards resolve against his. You can buy boosters or join drafts with the coins you get from playing, so that's great from the FTP angle. The only let down for me was that the card graphics are rather Hearthstoney. Definitely worth checking out. It actually took me away half the time from Magic Duels which is already great fun.			",152,57,4,35,28,3,56

												I haven't played for that long but from what I've played so far, it's been extremely fun! It's very different from any other card game I've ever seen or played. Its daily log-in reward system also helps a ton when trying to get new cards and more experience for your skills. The hero skins are a nice edition that I think fits well. All in all, for a free to play game this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while.			",16,4,0,6,5,0,5

												An absolutely fantastic new take on the genre - be the dungeon master for your character, fight past monsters, face enemy interference and arm yourself for the final confrontation!People will draw quite a lot of similarities between this and Hearthstone, but I would advise you to make up your own opinion. Since this is my review, let me share mine:The similarities between this and hearthstone:- Armor mechanic- Equipped weapons- Card collection / booster packs / crafting- Dungeoneering / draftOn the flip side, this game has no stable mana curve, several distinct resources that actually MATTER other than giving you static advantages, a chapter system that can drastically change the game prospect from one minute to the next, and an incredibly deep deck building system that allows you quite a lot of freedom in how you want to play your game.All in all I would say this is a very fresh take on the genre, even though it DOES borrow a number of the very best features in Hearthstone to flesh it out. (not that all the stuff mentioned actually originated in Hearthstone, mind you, but they are most well known from there at this time)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very addictive... for the first 8-9 hours... then the novelty wears off and it gets very repetative, the only reason I kept playing for so long is that this game really tries to condition you to continue with skinner box techniques, (i.e. giving you cards after every level, giving even better cards for every victory, exc.) Great if you want to hang with friends and have a bit of fun for a few hours, but if that's not your thing, just stay away.			",38,10,1,2,4,1,5

												GOOD DAY, FOE. ... it's a great game for people who like runescape and hearthstone. It's easy to learn, but can take just as long to master as hearthstone, being extremely complex deep down in the interactions of cards, the manipulation of the board and the managing of stats. Using your mind and playing this like a predictive puzzle game can help you get through the toughest of battles. Be strong. Get the game, and remember... Always enjoy the taste of failure, as you will learn from those events quite handily... This message was brought to you by THE RAPTOR, Fulfilling all your control and aggro needs.

												This is my first review, I figured since this game was pretty new I would let new players in on some things I have learned. 1. This is not like Hearthstone. Which is good, if you were looking for a decent card game thats not too complex.2. The ranking system in this game is very weird. Its kind of interesting. But needs to be fixed. You rank up for every win. But derank every loss. And there are more ranks per 3. Most importantly, the game is broken once you reach the ""Legend"" rank. It is almost all pay to win. Every deck is built (using quite a bit of money I think) almost all the same. There are only about 5 different decks once you pass a certian level, much like hearthstone. So it gets very boring. Unlike hearthstone there isnt much room for blanket cards to change the game in one go. But there are many cards that are just too OP. I think with some tweaking this could be a very fun and competitive game play, and as muich as I hate to play the boy who cried play to win, its just a simple fact once you really put some time into ranking up. I will change my review as updates come out. But for now I cannot reccomend this game.			",79,6,0,12,16,0,27

Too much emphasis is placed on who goes first and who goes second.After losing 5 games in a row because I went second, I've chosen to not recommend the game.My last two games came down to a final battle where we had identical health at the last swing.  Because I went second both times, I lost.As such, I can't recommend a game that at first glance seems to require so much pre-planning and strategy, but in the end relies on the biggest dice roll of all: Who goes first.I don't like Hearthstone because of its insane RNG elements, but at least in that game I know when I'm going to lose, and it doesn't rely on who goes first or second.It's a critical design flaw and absolutely ruins the game.The only way to resolve this is to abolish the first/second mechanic entirely and have everything play out at the same time.  Yes, it can lead to a draw, but draws are part of other CCGs too.  It's the only fair way to resolve things.. and the only thing that could save the game.There's discussions about this all over the forums; I didn't realize it was a huge problem until my last few games exposed how bad it really is.

												This game is good, I enjoyed playing it but probably wont be playing very much anymore, and here is why.1) Matchmaking seems unbalanced.  I got very lucky and opened 2 Diamond cards (Hearthstones Legendary equivalent) in the first week.  It isn't enough facing opponents that are playing 4-5 Legendary cards per game (on top of the multitudes of Rare and Epics). 2) The grind is real.  You can earn only ~500 gold through quests, and ~500 ish through wins, which is equal to 1 pack.I am getting burned out of the game before I can open new packs.  The quests are fast, and will probably only play for the quests.  But then I run into the first problem again, making me not want to play (this is the biggest reason I dont feel like playing much anymore).  I really dislike HearthStones Free 2 Play model, and this feels very similar to it.			",17,6,0,6,0,0,4

												After having opened 36 packs and only getting 2 rares with 0 legendaries, along with 3 dungeoneering runs with all 3 being a rating over 0/3, and having found that anyone using rares/legendaries holds a much, MUCH higher advantage-->(Such as, the usefullness gap from uncommon to rare, and rare to legendary is just way to big.) I've come to the conclusion that, while the games idea is incredible, its overall requirement to invest either days of your life, or nearly triple digits in USD, this game is hardly worth playing in comparison to Hearthstone, which, I've noticed epics and legendaries come from packs much more often, packs are cheaper if you go for them in either real currency or in game currency, and has less of a gap from common>rare>epic>legendary in card usefulness. This game is clearly a Micro-transaction oriented game and just tries to reel you in with its unique gameplay. Overall, a 4/10. Stick to hearthstone and save your time/dollars.			",71,8,0,14,8,0,5

												TCG/CCG that looks very different compared to all of its competitors currently in the market. This hyped my up when I first started playing this game back in closed beta. Sadly, I don't see myself playing this game anymore in the future because of the very same reason I was so hyped about.. the looks. It looks very childish imo... it's just not my thing. And I know the devs will not change the whole games looks just for me (one guy) even though the game is awesome.For the game: 7/10Looks: 4/10 (again, just my opinion)That all I can say.

												I am biased towards most free to play games.  Mainly because most are scams to trick customers into paying more money for less content.  This game is no exception.  It's clearly designed to be free to grind and pay for a huge advantage.  The ratio of grind advantage verses pay advantage is skewed so heavily for the fat whales that I don't think any normal person could keep up with a paying customer.  Hence, why I think the ""free to play"" business model is a scam.Don't get me wrong.  I absolutely admire the free-to-play model when done right.  However, if they MUST force you to compete in PvP to gain the free to grind rewards.  Then it's a poor model designed to make you the pawn for the elitist jerks.  In short, you should get paid MORE when being THAT pawn making all those elitist jerks have a happy experience destroying you.  This game fails to reward you, and the fun factor falls completely flat.  I quit after 2 hours.			",16,7,0,10,10,0,9

												A solid free to play CCG in the style of hearthstone with some very interesting new mechanics.Where it falls flat and sadly gets a thumbs down from me, a many time Legend rank hearthstone player, is the strategic depth. There are a TON of mechanics and resources, Armour, Health, Gold, Base Attack, and even spendable Weapon attack and Durability, On top of that, the mechanic the game is based around also introduces creature attack and health as an obstacle to receiving many resources. This makes the game feel cluttered and makes deck building a NIGHTMARE as often times you find yourself NEEDING to draw in a specific order to do well as a consquence.The fact that there are so many different things going on means that deck building doesnt feel as reawrding as it does in other more streamlined and well balanced games. It may become more interesting in the future with expansions and such, and being a free to play game i DO recommend you try it if you are interested, but as for a replacement for other games in the genre, no, not at all			",370,62,4,50,24,3,47

												I will begrudgingly admit that this game is exceptionally well done. I love to hate on JaGeX as a company, but amongst their failures lay a diamond, and that diamond is RS Chronicles. It's a breath of fresh air into a stagnating CCG arena, with a familiar yet refreshing undertone. The name of the game is to keep your legend alive, and kicking, using cards to build up money, weaponry, armour, and health to beat your opponent - trading blows along the way. Pros:- Balanced decks and heroes. Each ""legend"" has their own unique strength which their deck is based around. These strengths, and weaknesses, also factor into your opponent's difficulty. An opponent who may be easy with one legend, might be a harder fought battle with another. - Five chapters of turn-based battles, culminating in a fight to the death -- if you can survive that long.- Balanced. It's difficult, if not impossible, to have an all-powerful deck that crushes all legends in it's path. Incorporating ""legends"" balances the game quite nicely (At least that's my first impression).- Quests are nice as they encourage you to explore the game more deeply, while rewarding you with currency to go towards booster packs.- Gameplay is fairly easy to pick up.- Overall the game is not as P2W as one might expect, especially from a CCG. Sure, you can buy booster packs, get a bunch of good cards off the bat, and build some nice decks. However, you don't need to buy cards to do well. Just through playing the game, you can collect lots of decent cards, and build decks that are just as good.Meh:- Deck building is a strategic and lengthy endeavour. It takes a lot of time to get one tweaked *just* right. That said, it's mostly tolerable aside from building the initial deck from scratch. It could be smoother. I'm constantly checking what cards I have, and which I need. Cons:- Booster packs give you a whopping five cards per pack. Not that great considering how long you have to play to earn one without spending money.Overall, it's a good game that's definitely worth checking out.  8/10			",24,1,0,1,1,0,0

												When I first saw a game made by Jagex, I didn't know what to think: I liked oldschool Runescape and I told myself I wouldn't look back when I stopped playing their games......Based on what i'd heard upon its release: It's similar to Hearthstone and is not only cheaper (as in, you don't have to pay at all, if you don't want to) but it can take longer to acquire bronze coins/money to purchase booster packs and card backs from the Store. I haven't played Hearthstone before, so I can't really compare them, but what I do know based on my current gameplay is that Runescape Legends is sort of it's own unique game. Sure, there are similar aspects that I have seen in Hearthstone, but you don't get bored of playing this game because of it's selection of heroes and how they completiment the unlockable cards, which can be used to your benefit when confronting other players (and are all completely free, technically).Sure, it can be a little rough at unlocking good cards and levelling up, but when you get used to the gameplay and how each Legend works, then you have up to three different game modes to play: Practice (Basically a combination of the Tutorial and Campaign, the AI is pretty good!), Casual/Ranked (Casual is good for practicing the stratergies in your deck, but can effect your rank and help you earn extra EXP), Dungeoneering (When your total level reaches 15, you can go in a dungeoneering game using randomly selected cards and test your true skills for some extra loot!) The game and deck choices seem to be pretty fair on both players and all of the 5 possible Legends. Whether you treat this game like marmalade or not, it's definitely worth a few hours just to try it out! 90/100!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game. If you like playing with yourself you will like Chronicle: I am an adept user who can play with just about anything by myself and enjoy it quite a bit. Unlike traditional CSG's you cannot really set yourself up with some epic events to explode all over your character. 2 Scrotums up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly an amazing game, would reccomend to anyone that's a fan of cardgames or runescape. Takes a very interesting twist on standard cardgames that normally have you playing your cards against your opponent rather than yourself.			",6,3,0,3,0,0,0

												It's hard to say that this game doesn't take an interesting twist on the card-based games that have become popular in the last few years.The game seems to be very good, and the community is rather active already, even when it's the dead of night in some places. Combining an active community with a fun gameplay mechanic is really nice, and leads to a game that has more longevity.In brief, you are given a few 'legends' to play as, who each have their own specific cards at their disposal, which offer different playing styles. The game is played on a 3D plane, in which your 'legend' goes around attacking the battle cards, or paying (or doing whatver is needed for) adventure cards. The games are generally pretty short, and have five 'chapters', which is basically just five times in which you draw and play cards. If neither player is dead by the end of the fifth chapter, the two legends engage in a fight, during which your current attack rating, armor rating, and HP all come into play.Sadly, there are some issues with it. The most glaring one is the horrid matchmaking. The casual and competitve matchmaking both seem to (for whatever reason) either put you against people far below your level, or much higher than you. While it could just simply be an issue of the game not being able to find a game for you against somebody of your same skill level, I believe putting you against people who aren't close to your skill range is either unfair for yourself, or the other player. That said, this raises the second issue. As I mentioned, you may get matched with a much higher, or much lower ranked player, but the odds may be in the underdog's favor. The reasoning for this, is because the game seems to rely very heavily on RNG, and luck. While you can say all card-games have a degree of luck involved, this game seems to have it moreso due to the lack of actually needs gems or crystals to play cards. I've been on both ends (in two hours) of people getting a lucky string of +4 or +5 armor cards. While you can build your deck in such a way that it promotes these cards to pop up more, it seems that deck building isn't as neccessary as other games. That said, I have seen people prompt people looking up deck builders on the forums or Youtube channels, but for the casual player of the game, this may be a tad annoying.Lastly, this is neither an issue nor a good thing. There seems to be no chat function (at least from what I've seen). While this does keep people from mocking other players, or hurling insults, it makes the game feel a little bit more empty, due to the lack of communication between the two players. While a chat system didn't need to be in, it would have been nice to see.While the game isn't amazing, it has a fun new twist on the card-based game series, and due to the fact that it's free means that there is more incentive to actually try it out.

												I've said it before and I'll say it again.In this age of rampant free to play card games flooding the marketplace, I do believe that for one to stand out from the crowd, it needs to have something unique about it.This particular card game has players not battling eachother's decks exactly (using monsters to hit eachother with and what not), but it has you battling your own deck. You take form as an adventurer (one of many Legends) and plan what you encounter in your route to the final area of the dungeon/field/tower/level.It's an interesting take on the genre and really very addictive.Only real downside to it is that the balancing tends to change what cards do a bit too much for my tastes, in extremes this can end up changing how I build my entire deck. But still, if you're looking for a unique spin on the genre, this one's definitely worth a download.Fun card game is fun.			",142,19,1,22,7,1,32

												Strange game.Each game consists of 5 rounds. In each round you and your opponent play all or most of your hand simultaneously. You do not respond to his cards, nor he to yours. Most of the time you don't even know what cards he played, since the animation is too quick for you to notice what he is playing.The battle in all 5 rounds before the final 6th is not between him and you, it's between your legend or avatar and your own cards! When you attack or gain support from your cards, damage can be done to the opponent, but that need not happen and is not in fact the normal strategy.Once the cards in a round are played, the ""battle"" is automatic and advances to the next round. The only strategy available in a round seems to be to take a look at the opponent's legend's stats and maybe do something based on that info.For the main 5 rounds, you barely notice you have an opponent! The point is, for the most part, simply to buff your hero, in attack, health, and armor, in preparation for the final showdown. (You may need to weave damage to him, healing, and self-buffing, but it's a single-player experience.)The final round is completely automatic and just alternates between your legend damaging the opponent with basic attack and vice versa until one is dead. So, I don't get it.It's F2P and pretty to look at, so check it out anyway.			",4,3,0,4,1,0,2

												There is a reason why people who give a positive revews to this game, mostly have few hours played.Imagine pizza without cheese. That is Chronicle: RuneScape Legends.Why? one might ask.Simple answer:Because the game lacks cards.  People get bored really fast. At first, you might think, vov what an amazing game, but sadly it has no longevity.Hardcore answer:If you played hearthstone or any other card game for longer period of time, you will see that this game has very low number of cards. If you are starting the game, don't expect to have an abillity to create your own decks.  After playing for 5 hours, you will still have only few cards to add to your basic deck at most. And in general, there is just not many cards compared to other card games.  Game has brilliant Idea but cheap execution.  It is like playing a unifinished card game that lacks half of the cards.    Other then that, I ate 2 pizzas today.			",21,1,0,2,0,0,3

												Eh. It's alright. While it's not really like Hearthstone in terms of gameplay, it apes Hearthstone in most other ways. Grind 1000b(100g) for a booster packs, or spend 1500b(150g) on an dungeoneering(arena) run. There's no tavern brawl, instead replaced by a weekly ""epic quest"" that awards you a booster for winning X number of games in a week with certain legends(heroes). The gameplay is a neat twist from the standard TCG fare, the visuals are beautiful, but in terms of how content is portioned out, its like a more stingy Hearthstone; there are no adventures to pick up so you're stuck either buying price-inefficient booster packs or getting slaughtered in the dungeon (because the gameplay systems are completely different alien to new players so you're going in with almost no notion of the worth of cards you draft unless you use a tier list).With Hearthstone, the cards are characters, weapons, spells, and memes you know and love. For Chronicle... I don't think there's that same mainstream appeal. Why is a penguin called a KGP Agent and why is he taking my card to give me attack power? The cards, as far as I've seen, don't have in-game lore descriptions to mouse over. It makes it difficult to connect with the cards. Just my opinion. I would probably keep playing the game if the pricing model was different, but it's hard to justify fitting this game into your budget when there are alternatives with more content that can be acquired more quickly.

												As a start, while this game looks similarly to Hearthstone in the card/card stats, it plays very diferrently. Chronicle plays where you have five stages (rounds) while being able to play up to four cards a stage. While this is a fun and new way to play these sort of card games, it breaks the mold of almost every other card game by, essentially having each player play up to four turns behind the other player. With this set up, it becomes much harder than normal to predict what the other player is planning on doing this. Playing this far behind what the other playing is doing makes it feel like your moves mean nothing, and your standing at the beginning of the round has no indication on how the next rounds will play out. Some may argue that this is put in place to set a much higher skill ceiling for the game, which is true. However,  it feels awkward and almost like adding in artificial difficulty to make gameplay seem more nuanced and strategic to watchers. In all, this game is good at what it sets out to be; however, it is built on a faulty base game. The four-move system feels awkward and turns the game from a strategic card game into a meta that almost favours buffing yourself with hopes that the other player will buff themselves up less. So, in my mind, I would not reccomend this game to anyone looking for an online card game. Just play Hearthstone if you really something like that. ",109,17,4,14,11,0,6

												I want to like this game, but if you look closely in the majority of matches your plan does not change depending on what your opponent does, or changes very little in very obvious ways (like not playing an expensive card when you think they will steal your money so that you can't afford it). Therefore this is nothing more than a race against your opponent. May the best deck+RNG win.			",35,1,0,10,4,0,12

												First off: the game is REALLY fun and great, its a breath of fresh air in a scene that has been dominated by Hearthstone in the past few years and I'd recommend anyone who likes the genre. So why the 'dislike'? At the time of writing this the game has a few issues that seriously detract from the fun you could have with it.Pros:++ unique new mechanics that work really well+ really nice animations and effects (for the most part)+ business model seems fair (tough I haven't done any calculations)cons:-- random disconnects and server outages- not able to concede once the turn started forcing you to watch it to the endMostly nitpicking but annoying nonetheless:- the card opening animation is way too long- too many reward windows after a run - slows down the game- transition between chapters is rather slow- the menu could have been better crafted (some unnecessary clicks, crafting being obfuscated)- the avatars (big weird looking things in the background) are rather.. weird, would be nice to have an option to stop them from movingAll that said I'll keep playing the game and will change my recommendation once the disconnects are fixed.

												Interesting game and definitely not a copy of Hearthstone. The design is fairly unique.Unfortunately despite not being a copy Hearthstone, the design is similarly flawed. The nature of their being 4 cards played per chapter means you are unable to gauge or respond directly to what your opponent is doing, leading to a potential element of bluffing but also to a lot of flat out RNG which significantly hurts the tactical depth of the game.Add on top of that the fact that some cards have severe balance issues and I cannot really recommend this game despite its  new elements.

												Arena (Dungeon) drafting is completely broken. I had multiple cards appear in 4-6 rounds of the draft phase, and not good cards, awful ones. Zero synergy amungst my draft options. Zero early game power. Horrible imbalance in support/fight cards (way too many support cards, not enough cards to generate the gold for said support). Meanwhile I'm matched with enemies who have seemingly customly crafted premade decks. They have such perfect syngery, so great curve as far as gold income and spending. Considering the arena is already rather expensive in comparison to Hearthstone's, this seriously needs a balance addressing.			",61,4,0,7,3,0,1

												While the idea is refreshing and interesting, I've stopped playing even before going online: it's basically impossible to have any fun once you reach the gold A.I., you are just overwhelmed by your own underwhelming card collection.I don't feel like grinding for hours on end to eventually unlock more playable cards, I have better things to do with my time, like playing games that are worth said time. And I'm not falling in the trap of giving money, not so soon anyway, they need to fix that part.All hail F2P, I guess.Again, too bad because it was quite a motivating concept. Balnace it to make a pay to play and I'm sure I'll have a wondrous time with it.Edit: OK, after several more attempts and trial/error, I've finally overcome (sic) the gold A.I. You have to get a bit lucky but it definitely lies in the deck building too. Still, they could (and should) improve the early game to motivate the player more. I'll come back to the review once I have a more complete opinion (or if I definitely had enough of it).			",329,81,6,23,24,3,39

												Low playerbase (you wait a long time to queue) and imo very unbalanced mechanics. There's a great deal of luck that goes into each stage because you are forced to play four cards in a row blind, which means it's hard to react to an opponent's strategy. It's a little like throwing darts at one another in a dark room - it comes down to luck over strategy or skill. I do really like the sense of progression with the leveling system and achievements, and I wish other TCG would incorporate this. But I think Faeria, Duelyst & Might and Magic have far better underlying mechanics. But maybe this will appeal to some people.			",61,16,0,45,4,1,34

												Standard card experience with rarities, booster packs, card stats, etc with a twist from the actual mechanics of the game. The mechanics make the game worth at least trying out, considering it's free to download.Very obvious that ""long-haul"" decks meant to power you to endgame won't be useful when your opponent's direct damage deck kills you in the 2nd chapter. Haven't gotten to the extremely strong cards yet but what I've seen now doesn't bode well. Too many glitchy animations make games last forever. No speedup button against AI or a way to disable animations to speed up matches. I'll personally be playing it for the enjoyably unique mechanics until I hit the paywall of meta-users who's cards simply outclass mine. In that regard it's similar to all other digital card games.

												I have never had the need to write a bad review for any other game, no matter how bad I thought it was. But that isn't what you want to know. Why is this game so incredibly bad that I actually took the time to give a bad review? It has nothing to do with gameplay, or what this game is all about. The thing is I have no idea what this game is all about because the text is always blurry no matter what resolution I set it to. There is no way to zoom on any cards or text...but I digress. This is getting ahead of myself. First things first.First start up:I use dual monitors. It starts on the wrong monitor. I change the settings to use monitor 2 (my main is monitor 1, which it is actually set to...but yea anyway). While this is happening, apparently things regarding choosing main characters and such are happening without me being able to see what is going on or choose anything because currently in process of setup. The game tells me to restart. I restart. Bear in mind that the text options in the settings menu are pretty blurry to begin with.Second start:It starts on the same monitor. Check the settings. It is set to monitor 2 (wrong monitor) so I think OK, if I change it to monitor 1 now (correct monitor) maybe it will work. Change to monitor 1. Have to restart. Restart.Third restart:Lo and behold it is still on the wrong monitor. Change it to windowed mode and drag it over to the correct monitor. Even with the resolution being correct it is too big for my screen and the settings and some other stuff I haven't even looked at are out of the screen. I can't even maximise...who knows why but you can't click it. In the mean time the game has jumped into the tutorial, so I've missed a bit of the game already. They are losing my business fast.Many restarts later:I've tried many things, and combinations of things to get it working on the correct monitor to no avail. Changing resolution, windowed/full etc. I check online. It is a known problem and I have to use Windows+shift+arrow left/right to switch between monitors. Great. Except the problem has been know for over half a year and nothing done to fix it. And guess what? Using that method glitches your mouse so that you have to click a space away from the actual button to trigger. Check online. Also a known problem and also been more than half a year and nothing done to fix it. I finally (by sheer luck), figure out a way to have it fullscreen on my main monitor and with no mouse issues. Cool. Onward to the game which has started the tutorial and I have apparently chosen a knight or something as my char. Not that I did any of the choosing although I saw an option to do so while I was trying to get the screen issues resolved. I face a sprite, elf or wizard or something. across what looks like a board of some kind...is she my buddy? One of my chars? And a card being explained to me in the form of:""This is a card (click to continue). This is damage (click to continue). This is health (click to continue). Now place that on the board along with 3 other cards, which aren't explained to you and now you have to battle...(click to continue)"" So my knight (at this point I realise the knight is supposed to be me and the wizard is my ""rival"") goes along and does stuff which isn't explained and I magically win the battle. I say magically because I have no idea what just happened.Anyway. I win the battle and now I get told there are 4 more of these unexplained magical battles I need to do before the map is won. Nothing gets said about what are my cards, my deck, or how to utilise them. Which I find strange because isn't this a CCG?Round two and now my ""rival"" is in on the game. I have to get her health down to 0 but you aren't told how to do that although i grant at the end of the 5 battles you may have some idea. So I putter along with nary any information and win the last battle. Yay. Now I can do what I want. I have a look at deck building. The text is so small and blurry, even on my 42in screen at any resolution, so that everthing is practically illegible. There is no way to zoom in on any of the cards. Which may be a blessing so that I don't have to look at the atrocious ""art"" but at the same time I can't read anything on the cards at all.And this, ladies and gentlemen, is where I decide this game has absolutly no place in my future except to warn off others.I'm not sure how long this game has been out, frankly I don't care, but there is no excuse to release such a poorly put together piece of crap that I had to spend an hour to get it working, just to find out I can't even read any of the cards.Well done devs. You've succeeded in taking a huge dump on the CCG community. I recommend Card Hunter instead. That game will not dissapoint on any level for a f2p CCG. Just some proof for you guys: Even people who ""Highly"" recommend this have so few hours in it that it should be enough to indicate how bad this game really is.			",80,15,1,26,4,0,20

												The classes are horribly unbalanced, mages have the highest damage and the most ""sabotage"" cards.  The vampire and to a lesser extent the tank, are outmatched as their mechanics rely on sacrificing health, when the mage can already deal 30+ damage with just 2 cards.If an opponent disconnects it says you win but it does not count towards your wins, in dungneering(arena) it actually takes a life from you just like a loss.  DO NOT spend real money on arena until this is patched!Base attack should not be allowed to drop below 2, in ranked people are using this mechanic to grief, in arena mode if you draft a card that reduces your opponent's base attack it is an instant win.They really should've stepped out from Hearthstone's shadow, the gameplay of Chronicle: RL is much different than Hearthstone, yet they've borrwed so much from the latter.  The gamemodes, art style, pack opening, turn timers, etc. all make it look like a cheap knockoff of Hearthstone.  That, combined with numerous bugs and flawed concepts makes me question if the people behind this are actually commited to the title.EDIT: Permanently altering your oponent's base attack is horribly unbalanced, paticularly in arena-clone where the availability of base attack increasing cards is much more scarce.  Once your attack reaches 1 you are combat ineffective, even weak creatures can take off a good portion of your health, you can really only hope that you draw an affordable weapon before the final fight.The draw mechanic is pointless in the final chapter (aside from a class-specific ability involving hand size), so if you pick draw cards with no additional effect you run the risk of it being a dead card.The concede button doesn't skip animations, the final battle really drags on when you already know you've lost.  Additionally there are 3 post-game continue buttons (just to show your progress in level, rewards & acheivments) that add uneeded click-through time to the process.Going first is a major advantage, Besides getting in the first hit of the final battle, going first is the only way you can guarantee the outcome from any card, and it happens up to 5 times per game (once per chapter).  Meanwhile the player going second has to gamble on whether you've sabatoged what they earned in the last chapter (gold, weapons, and/or armor) or otherwise altered the state of their board (by adding health and/or attack to enemies for instance).""Dungeonering"" (AKA HS Arena) drafts are incredibly awkward, the game is biased toward big, expensive cards that A) you won't have the gold for OR B) will deal massive damage to you.  The easy, cheap cards rarely appear, so you will most likely wind up resource starved, smashing your unarmed character into overpowered monsters iust to keep pace with your opponent.TLDR: If you are intending to spend real money on packs, I'd recomend waiting a few months to make sure the community and developers are still active.

												Despite not being a lucky fellow, I generally like card games. In my opinion Chronicle has a really nice and fresh approach and I enjoyed my first hours in the game. Having done a tutorial match against all classes, I had my first moment of disillusion. If you want to create your first deck, there is very little to work with. You will have to put almost every card available in your first deck. Ok, booster packs are a little easier to achieve, in comparisson to hearthstone, but the heroes show little difference at that stage (only few different class cards available in the beginning).That by itself would be quite alright for me to work with, but as far as I have played the game seems to have some major balancing issues. There are 3 AI tiers, that allow you to battle every hero on each tier. I had no problem obliterating the AI on tier 2 until I faced the smith. She uses some few cards to build absurdly strong weapons, that won't just smash you in the final showdown, but can be used to deal critical damage to you during the journey. It is quite possible, that this may change in the later stages of the game, but if that frustration is what I have to endure going far enough to develope counter strategies, I'll rather quit right now.

												ok so the game itselfis heavily unbalancedwho goest first usually wins, unless the one going first has a bad draw....very few different card effects and alot of low cost cards with overpowered effects.its repetetive and boring reallymost of the time you just watch.the ranked system pits you against higher ranks....*cough no data wipe cough*the dungeon system is broken,it makes you pick 2 random cards for 15 turns before you start,however it is possible to be stuck with monsters/support cardsthat are completely useless. or you will just end up killing yourself.....the devs show a horrible future for this gamethey can't even do a clean accurate SIMPLE statistic test.....you can't suggest anything like that either oh MOD forbidden you give feedback .o.than there are the staff members, they are toxic as crazy they pick on playersthey don't care about anyone's opinion or give a♥♥♥♥♥♥br>about feedback.they literally chose,not ot wipe everything after beta,so that they could keep all cards and ranks and kept a headstart on everyone to show off their so called skills....the forums are being terrorized by two mods called glenn and merchant thatclose/remove all threads about subjects they disagree withthen they threathen to ban you byclaiming you attacked ''community members''no one really.....apparently making a thread about the behavior of moderatorsis seen as an attack of ''community members'' O.o?they also have a last word in the thread and close it....talk about show of power/dominance nothing but♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥abusing their position....

												The gameplay reminded me of playing the munchkins card game. You have a 'hero' that you fight monsters with, and occasionally manage to whittle the other person's hero down. There's some strategy in the cards you choose but ultimately the game falls to RNG like most card games do.I have to say it's a lot of fun so far. A very refreshing take on the card game genre. Was getting pretty tired of everything playing similarly to Hearthstone. (Not to say Hearthstone was first.)			",400,65,1,77,93,1,79

												Chronicle: RuneScape Legends is a weird, but different taste/twist on the collection card game genre. It's more of a placing your cards in strategic positions in which so can out smart your opponent. Instead of just battling your opponent hand after hand. They added chapters to the game (game consist of 5 chapters), after the 5th chapter if both heroes are left standing, they battle it out 1v1 style. The one with the most armor and weapon damage will most likely win.Things to know; straight off the bat, the game had server issues once I opened the game. Bad start there. It seemed after I waited a few hours I could actually complete the tutorial. There isn't a campaign, just multiplayer. You can battle against AI's in which you can get practice at the game more. I noticed that the game uses the 24-hour format instead of the 12 hour format. Sadly in settings, there isn't an option to change this. V-sync is turned on automatically once you open the game, be sure to turn that off. The UI does look like something out of 'Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft'... kinda weird. Since it is a free to play game, the game does have micro-transactions to buy new cases to unlock more playing cards.Note: When I was 'practicing' against an AI, the game did a hard crash to the desktop. Game is still buggy.Me personally, I haven't played RuneScape since I was like 13 years old. And now in 2016, I know nothing about the game. Some backstory or even some info to shed some light on why you are fighting... this info would have been useful.What would be added to this game (If I had the power), I would add more animations to the characters on the battlefield. The animations are kinda iffy and lack luster. And lastly, a storyline... maybe?Just because of the different taste/twist on the collection card game genre, I would recommend this game. I came off not liking it since it's ""another"" card game, but this game seemed kinda fun once you get used to it.			",75,11,2,5,10,4,3

												Runescape Legends is a novel concept where 2 players streamline their decks and race to kill each other before/at the end of 5 chapters (rounds). You choose a class, make a deck and face your deck off against your opponent. Each round you choose up to 4 cards to play. Your choice of card ranges from equipment, allies, minions and spells. Minions have to be killed by you to earn you gold and you spend this gold on everything else. However, minions get to attack you and reduce your life points in the process, if your life points drop to zero, you've lost the game.There are 2 currencies in the game, Copper (grind currency) and Platinum (cash currency). The best pricing I saw for Platinum was $75 for 7500 Platinum ($1 for 100 Platinum). The best pricing for booster packs was 36 Basic Boosters for 2270 Platinum (63.05 Platinum for 1 Booster Pack = $0.65 for a booster pack at best)PROS1. Novel ConceptIt's a race with an interesting twist.2. Drawing 3 Cards Instead of 1This +3 draw is far better than the standard +1 draw seen in Collectible Card Games (CCGs).3. Hearthstone SimilarityYou can see similarities such as the art style, card binders, card anatomy, etc.4. Vampire ClassPretty interesting to me. It's very thematic but hard to play. You steal HP from creatures and your opponent while giving it to yourself. However, the HP steal doesn't even trigger if you're at max HP.5. DungeoneringYou have to be level 15 to try it out. Seems interesting but knowing that I have to grind 15 levels is just too much.6. Auto-calculationsI like how Chronicle calculates whether you win/lose just by you placing your 4 cards. It gives me interesting information.CONS1. Pay To WinSadly, I saw the pricing mechanism in the game. This turned me off a lot. It costs 1000 copper coins (grind currency) to get 1 booster pack. You need to grind for too long just to get 1 pack.At a default rate of 75 Copper Coins per Solo Battle WIN, you would need 10 battles plus Copper from additional quests,  just to grind 1 pack.2. Little InteractionSo, do I even care about what cards my opponent plays? I just look at his stats and decide whether I want to eliminate him before the final fight. Could you possibly even know his strategy? Or are his strategies basically limited to his class?3. GrindingRefer to the Dungeoneering PROS.4. Rarity CreepIt takes 2500 Dust to craft a Diamond level rarity card. There are 4 levels of rarity in the game, Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby and Diamond. Diamond is the rarest type of card and costs 2500 Dust to craft 1. It's another extreme grinder.SUGGESTIONS1. Improve Player InteractionPlay your hand cards into your opponent's lane. E.g. Placing a high cost giant Dragon in your opponent's way to attack him.2. Environmental modifiersI saw the desert and the graveyard backgrounds. Perhaps, the terrain could buff creatures, modify spells or give coins. This may imbalance the game greatly since no one knows what chapter comes next. You could let the players choose the 5 locations that they play in. E.g. 2nd player choose 3 locations, 1st player choose 2 locations, then you randomise the order.3. Give Value to not playing cardsCurrently, does reaching the end of the chapter first give you any advantage? No. So, if you are unable to fully utilize the 20 slots given to you, you lose out. You might give a small reward to the player who reaches the end of the chapter first, like a race.4. Increase the number of classesVampire, Tank, Blacksmith, Mage, Thief. You need a lot more for variety.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reading through some of the reviews for this game, I must correct a few errors most of them seem to have (not sure if they were paid to praise this game so much, or if they honestly just don't understand). All this is based on my first ~40 hours of play time, unlike the reviews who praise the game all the way into high heavens after playing it for 2 hours.Anyone who says that this game isn't 'Pay To Win' doesn't know or understand what that means, because your winrate will keep rising the more you pay and collecting (good) cards is extremely slow if you don't shove a considerable amount of money into it. This will probably be less of a problem if you grind it 6 months straight, but at start this is a serious problem.Also there is very little strategy or tactics involved, the outcome of the game is based primarily on which player has paid more for their deck and secondarily by RNG. If both players have decks (and common sense*) of similar level, the outcome of the game is based on which player gets better hands for the particular deck they're playing against and if they get lucky aiming the ""counters"" against them. *If you're familiar with deck building from MtG, HS or such, piling up all the few good cards you own for your deck (which ain't that hard since you won't have much) and picking the least bad fillers after that, you will notice that almost all strategy ends there. After that all that remains is the timing when to play your cards and in which order, and that really ain't as hard as some people seem to think.After all that being said, I still think that the game is good. Or at least it would be if one would be able to grind cards faster (you stop getting the in-game currency after 10 or so wins). The gameplay is fun and games only last 5-10 minutes, which allows you to play as many games as you currently have time on your hands. But I just can't recommend this because your winrate is dominated by the 2 devils called P2W and RNG.EDIT 1 (~80 hours): Also worth mentioning, that 90% of the games where both decks are on a similar level are won by the player who gets to start (because that player gets to start the whole game). And if you're playing a deck that can't win by chapter 3, it's not worth playing. Since there's 5 chapters + the end fight to play, why are the decks who win in 2 or 3 chapters completely dominant?

												As a F2P player the first time I pleyed it I was woundering why was I playing hearthstone. But after 30 hours of gameplay I woundering why am I playng this over Hearthstone.  This game tries to be hearthstone but really hearthstone; so I will be comparing to hearthstone.Pros:- Beautiful art style.- Innovative gameplay style which is never seen before in in CCG. This game is all about rhythm, and disrupting your opponent's rhythm.- Not as much RNG as hearthstone but there is still RNG involved. Many people think this is a positive thing, but In my mind RNG is what made Hearthstone in the first place (e.g. getting Ragnoros out of unstable portal out of spellslinger out of unstable portal is way more fun than ""oh I drew Snapshot and I am 1st I guess I win, spam ""Sorry"" emote"" ). With that said there is no badly designed cards like ""Flame juggler"".Cons:-Balance is terrible in this game. There are way too many cheap powerful cards and expensive weak cards. If you are playing for free you will get destoyed by P2W sabotage cards and you have to draw specific cards to recover. Some classes are way better than other classes. I played as Linza a lot which relys heavily on gold and weapons, while there are many tech cards that counter this class, there are few that destroy armor for example. - low number of classes. game gets boring after a while. -The cards are boring. Kill this get 1 base attack, pay this get this weapon. discard a card draw this many cards.  -Why on earth there is no squelsh feature. Why do I have to hear my opponent spamming emotes while I am tring to make plays.- Don't bother conceding when you know you are going to lose. Just quit the game and replay it, it's faster this way. The game won't let you concede during the chapter or in last fight between the legends. So, you have to sit there and watch the animations. - The leveling up system Is way too slow. I still have not unlocked all the basic cards even after 30 hours of gameplay. - Shard/dust cost for cards is way too expensive. The dust/craft ratio is about half as much as hearthstone. i.e. half as much cards you can get as hearthstone.Conclusion:There are many technical issues which can be fixed with patches. My only problem with this game is lack of interactivity and balance. Sabotage and burst damage is way too powerful and cheap in this game.   Many will say it's pay to win, but many card games are like that, although it is more pronounceable here. The game has potential but not the way it is right now. I would strongly recommend it after couple patches or exapnsions, but for now I will play hearthstone and reck people with my free to play almost all legendary deck.			",326,39,7,40,14,3,65

												The idea idea is fresh and unique, but that was about all.For me, this game is even worse in terms of random and pay to win than Heartstone.As with Heartstone, you HAVE to win with classes you don't have cards for, in order to gain gold from ""epic quests"".The gameplay as frustrating as it gets for someone who not a fan of random mechanics. I've never been so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by ANY game. You have to guess not only if opponent have a card you have to counter at all, but roughly WHEN he will play this card (as you can play up to 4 cards per turn), so you can waste a card, or win by LITERALLY casting 1 card at right time, which can lead to opponent losing half of HP.Fun to watch, but not fun to play.

												They also banned this account without warning or explanation merely based on this honest review.Pure P2W! Every low tier common card has a craftable same exact bonuses with added attributes/buffs craftable legend card that p2w'ers can just make by buying card packs then using any cards to craft a pure P2W deck.non p2w cards gotten from gameplay have no advantage or equal cards to compare to p2w craftable cards.In over 2,000 games 88% of them were losses due to my opponents all using full red tier or legend p2w craftable decks theyd made using wallet warrior 101 stragegy. The worst P2W deck being Ozen. You can stack multiple no cost legend cards that grant excessive gold with armor,weapons and debuffs to the opponents deck then use 5+ cards to double that gold per card used then use a single P2W ""Ling's assassin card"" Which deal's half your gold in retard high excessively overkill damage that has no counter and one shot any opponent regardless of any strategy. My favorite loss was seeing this wallet warrior stack over 200 gold and deal an amount of damage able to kill multiple fully armor tanks.			",25,5,0,10,1,0,6

												Another RNG based card game with lots of flaws and few positivesPros:+ 3 card draw per turn instead of usual one.Cons:- 0 originality with decks, you can either play against ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t OP decks and lose or make your own copy paste deck- Just carries that eternal curse that certain card combos with classes are too good and majority of players use them.- Needs lots of real money to get good cards- Only good mode, dungeoneering, costs too much to play without using real money- Can't get in game currency on single player after defeating each hero once per difficulty (bronze, silver and gold)- Player who goes first have HUGE advantage with countering enemy cards, abilities and at the end of the game 1st strike can easily determine who wins the game.-If enemy has lethal damage with a card before final battle and you play heal at the same card slot damage will go off first and game over.-In ranked you only encounter same decks and zero unique/interesting decks.-Some cards are just overpowered.-Instead of skill winner is determined by deck and RNG (drawing, going first and having better cards)-Level cap for heroes so you can't get rewards after lvl 25-can't trade cards-No observer mode-no co-op mode-this is only some of the problems in this gameMixed+/- you can have some fun with this game if you are willing to spend real money on dungeoneering mode.Final rating   0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played for hours and hours my first time through, and this is barely like runescape, though its akin to the style of hearthstone. Still it takes a rediculous amount of time to get anywhere with a character, and even after a mid level range, one must THEN grind against actual players to increase any actual skills. All that stacks are cards initially, and just endless grind through the solo stages to familiarize oneself with the mechanics. But this was a hollow, empy adventure in the end.The game had multiple bugs and inconsistent rngs and battle abilities did not always pan out the way they should have. All requirements for things were present, and should have run smoothly, but alas, bunk.Not to mention the inglorious freemium state of the game and how its a slooow grind to get anywhere, then realize theres little decent besides a dungeon that forces an unfamiliar player character nad its cards upon a person without prior warning.Oh but the people I played against in the dungeon were on THEIR normal characters; well built and familiar to the point that I, playing , again as I said before, an unfamiliar character class, was easy prey. The game lost its luster quickly once there was little recourse but to continue to grind for little reward, or just quit.I played Runscape for 3 years since 2003, and I got no nostalgic joy of that experience through this strange expansion of the franchise. No need to play ever again, even with many victories on the raptor class. It just was not worth it. Jagex needs to stop jaggin around and fix the problems inherent.			",1,3,0,2,0,0,0

												Sorry but no....Well I guess if you intend to play it 100% free Thumbs up you will probably have some fun houers, But don't spend money on this, I did and i sinserly regret it.Why?, the game got more RNG than a 27 sided Die, and are full of Broken and unbalaced cards. Besides who goes first have a enormus advantage....Let me give you a example, you got a Class card for thief \""Black Marketeer\"" Will give you 1g and makes the next suport card your opponent plays that turn cost 1 more (So you got 3 chances of that happening 4 of you start first).. He might not eaven trow any....Now on the other hand you got a creature card avaible for all that is \""Free\"" to kill gives you one gold and removes one gold from the opponent..... It\'s just stright up better in any way... And this is not eaven a class card :pWell now you might think as you have to plan ahead and the class card would be better if the opponent was at 0 gold....NOPE, In a really odd cenario where you got lucky enugh to start 50%/50% and the Opponent had 0 gold, you are simply better off trowing down the -1 on slot 2 or 3 instead... :p As everything in this game it\'s a gamble... :pI see everyone is calling this game Strategic... I have to Disagree, the Strategic elements and cards in this game is broken by the simple fact that who goes first will allways go first......Witch in turn renders the most \""Strategic\"" cards mostly useless or up for a gamble......Lets say you got a weapon removal Card.... yeah Great if your the person starting, and your oponent end his turn with a weapon. If not your♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck because the opponet will spend that weapon long before you can use the card... you might as well just close your eyes and put it in a random slot, praying that your opponent will pick up a weapon that turn...This game only got 351 diffrent cards cards so far... In my oppinion they will have to rebalance more than half of them before it gets my thumbs up, and REALLY somthing have to be done about the turn orders.... Not like I start I win... as it is now.....25 hours later and 40€ porer im uninstalling this... God I wish I bought Witcher 3 and a seson pass instead :p			",183,70,4,64,25,6,61

												Compared to Hearthstone, it is way too complex. Although it is a card game, once you decide on the cards for your turn (chapter), then it is more like an adventure of your hero (legend) vs the other hero. During chapter plays, you don't even see your hand. So, it is kind of an RPG-adventure-card game. I don't think it will reach a great audience due to complexity and unfamiliarity of gameplay.

												Just like many other CCGs, it's pretty much completely luckbased. Did you see the card that will save you in this situation? Yes? Okay, then you'll probably win. Oh, did you go second so your opponent got the extra hit in before you did, even though you were both on pretty much even playing fields going into the final fight? Well, GG.It's a great idea, and very unique. I like that Jagex is attempting to do something different in terms of CCGs. However, I just haven't had much fun playing this game. The way to unlock cards for each deck character is to level them up, but you level them up kind of slowly, which turns the game into a grind. I don't know about you, but I don't try to play CCGs to  GRIND LEVELS.Seguing to my next point, booster packs are way too expensive. 1,000 bronze for a SINGLE booster pack that only contains FIVE cards? I don't even think in my 4 hours of constantly playing that I got that 1,000 bronze.2/10 - Great concept, don't like the execution.EDIT:After reading other reviews on the game, I decided to reinstall the game and give it another chance. Did not change my thoughts on the game and, in fact, actually made me dislike it more.Almost forgot to talk about Dungeoneering, which makes the game even more luckbased. Not only do you only get to choose between two RANDOM characters when you try to go into it, but the cards you get are pretty much random. Sometimes you get cards that have little synergy with each other and causes you to lose every game because the deck just WILL NOT WORK WITH THE CARDS THEY GIVE YOU. I went into a dungeon where I chose Linza, and they did not give me any weapon durability/damage manipulation cards. However, they gave me a bunch of high levelled monsters and goblins. Needless to say, I played one game, realized that the deck had no plays, and immediately conceded, closed the game, and uninstalled.New score:1/10 - Unique concept, very poor execution.

												I thought this game would be right up my alley (and it is), but I can't recommend it. Now note that I'm reviewing this game just after it came out, but there is *way* too much work left to be done for it to really be playable. There's barely any content.Pros:+ Love the idea. A novel idea for a CCG.+ Nice polish on the graphics and look of the game.Cons:- The game needs a lot more characters, classes, and stuff to do. After an hour I unlocked every playable character... I'm sure much of this is coming in time, but I don't think this game had any business being released this early in the process.- The playable characters sound great, in theory, but they were awfully homogeneous. Yes, one class might get an extra armor card here or there, and another might have a class skill, but I could care less which class I was playing or who I was up against because they all seemed the same.- I also had no desire to customize a deck because the cards are also quite homogeneous and uninspired.- Every match felt the same. After just a few matches, I had no desire to go through the same thing over and over again. - I found the organization of the menus and things to be clunky and to hide much of the information I was looking for.

												About as fun, and as balanced as hearthstone - Which means, theres some op combos and instant wins. Just went two round pulling nothing out only to win in the next 6 cards.It's a good timewaster just like hearthstone, but not anything i'll be investing a whole lot of time. .

												So, the game is alright for what it is. Deckbuilding is shamelessly ripped from Hearthstone, down to the aesthetic, but whatever. Gameplay is completely different, allowing you to plan a series of actions over each ""chapter"", and dueling your enemy at the end of chapter five.The problem is, PvE rewards are finite. The first three ""dailies"" are available for completion in PvE, and the rest you shall receive over the course of the game are PvP exclusive. The game in its current state does not tell you this. Once you earn your PvE rewards, either grind AI for levels, or play PvP. And we should all know by now, PvP does not make a game good.On the topic of Blizzard, let's compare it loosely to WoW: You can quest 'til 10, but then you have to farm Alterac Valley for literally the rest of the game.

												    Played this for about 5 minutes and shut it off... It reminds me of something....Heres the gameplay. Click 3 or 4 cards then press play. THATS IT.. oh ya so much depth...like who gives a rats♥♥♥♥♥about the different cards and potential strategy. I gotta say it again: YOU CLICK A FEW CARDS (after taking forever to draw them) THEN PRESS PLAY. THATS ALL YOU DO. You people need to stop giving original ideas credit just for being original. The gameplay is horrendous.    I have no idea what kind of enjoyment you could get out of this.. But There was none to be had for me. Shame on you guys.     Im not exaggerating you could have more depth bouncing a ball against a wall. Theres some serious physics going on there. If you took out the art you could program this gameplay in probably 1 sitting. Looks cool tho...if that makes a difference. OH I KNOW what it reminds me of... POGS. You remember POGS? ya this game is as stupid as that but ppl wanna collect stuff...its also trying to capitalize on people who are bored of hearthstone.			",129,58,0,58,10,3,56

												Incredibily simplistic, slow paced and boring.There aren't many mechanics in the game at all. There is no interaction with the opponent. You choose your 1 out of 4 strategies, build your tiny 30 card deck out of your tiny collect and let the random number generator do its thing.I really don't know how the average member of society is so easily entertained by games that take so little thought. I guess I'm old.Anyway, even if it was actually fun:Booster contain 5 cards.There are very few cards total in the game at all.They're asking an awefully high price for boosters considering they contain 5 cards.There are a plethora of TCGs out there that give much better value. Try on of those out instead.			",13,11,0,19,9,1,25

												Chronicle is actually a pretty good card game. Unfortunately, while you play the game you have to look at a giant frickin' NPC version of the enemy you're facing that spams the dumbest, most obnoxious facial expressions imaginable literally every time they get gold or a buff or take damage and sometimes just for the hell of it. It's almost meme-worthy, and NOT in a good way. Just play against the Raptor and watch him spaz out in between rounds when you're setting cards up for a chapter. It's ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous, and there's no way to turn that stupid BS off. That is NOT how you simulate sitting across from someone at a ♥♥♥♥ing card table playing a game; that's how you make a joke of your own frickin' game.Dropping the ball again, Jagex. You guys don't need to crap on your own games man. This isn't even a completely terrible game. WTF man can't believe that bs honestly lmao SMH.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very little thought or interaction required. YAWNVILLEYou get a hand of cards and some cost gold coins or whatever it is they called it. You use those gold coins to pay to play more advanced cards from your hand. Coins/attacks/heals/armor/items, you decide which five cards to play based on whether you want to stack up armor, attack, equip an item, heal, or gain coins and in what order you want to do all those. After that you watch the game play itself for awhile and hopefully you can kill your opponent quick so you dont have to go through this rinse and repeat process four more times just to watch your character fight your opponent at the end.I did like the art style, the table top view with the opponent visible, and aside from the actual characters the animations were pretty charming.

												It's boring as fudge sitting on a windowsill in the rich part of town. Too afraid to fully steal ideas from anyone, and too high-and-mighty to show its full strength. It's basically Jagex thinking that their players are little children who need to have their hands held through the entire game.It is not fun. You sit and watch more then you actually play, and that's on YOUR turn. God help you if you don't have any cards to play. Microtransactions from Day 1 and a grind worse then a diamond needs to look pretty. Not worth your time, as this will go the way of Runescape itself, and become a big, fat, malodorous cash cow that farts in the face of free to play and ♥♥♥♥♥ money for Jagex. Dirty, foul, money.This game is JUST like the real Runescape in one aspect. If you've played it before, then you'll enjoy yourself. If you're just starting, prepare to be bored out of your mind.(Made an edit to fix something that wasn't true)			",192,15,6,23,10,3,12

												I would not recommend this game to anyone but serious Runescape fans who just want to play it because of the branding.Let me start off with the good bits about this game: The graphics are quite nice, and in an unique style.There is however a major problem with this game, there is literally no strategy involved.I'm not just saying that because card games have a luck based element associated with them, yes they do, and I believe that the luck based element can be negated through skillful play, this game however, does not let you do that.The worst design sin of all, you cannot see the moves your opponent has made until the end of a turn, so you have to base everything off of speculation, since both players play their cards at the same time, which removes any element of tactics from the equation.The game can literally be boiled down to: plop down your cards in the order that will give you the most bonuses, and then press play to see who wins.

												I think if you ever played runescape, you should probably avoid this.Remember when JAGEX released Ace of spades, and it crashed? It wasn't the cost, it's because it just wasn't JaGEx,Jagex is runescape. Runescape is jagex. They can't do anything else, they've been branded.the game;Gameplay 1/10 for Solo, 7/10 for Versus players. - Bots are overpowered and they're scripted moves are annoying.Layout 1/10 - REALLY buggy, did they have a closed alpha for nothing? What did they sit there and just stare at the screen? fix♥♥♥♥♥♥yo!Generally 2/10. Bigest pile of crap I've ever seen released.I'm dissapointed JaGEx, 15 years in development and you can't bring out something more graphically pleasing than Amnesia?It literally looks like a low quality runescape cutscene.

												This game is much more luck based than Hearthstone. The only strategic part in it is deck building. The rest is just luck of the draw. I dont feel like I have any influence on the outcome. Im just puting cards in the only most logical order. Sometimes even playing cards can hurt you more than help. If Im winning or losing, I dont know why. What I did good or wrong? I cant counter my opponent or make anything meaningful to him except doing some random damage from time to time. Most of it is only about your character, buffing yourself, building an adventrue for your character only. The opponent in the background is meaningless most of the time, just a nuisance. As you do nothing big to him, he doesnt impact you aswell. You're palying against your own deck. For a PvP card game lack of interaction between players is terrible.			",79,4,0,11,4,0,9

												As its known by everyone who played Jagex's main game, ""Runescape"", they like to copy other games, especially the ones from Blizzard.Even though the concept of the game is different from Hearthstone, the main core of the game remains the same, and the idea is the same from Hearthstone.When they stop copying other companies and start making their own games, maybe then they'll get the atention they think they deserve.Runescape was an amazing game until Jagex decided to change the core of the game because they thought they would attract more players that way, basically copying ""World Of Warcraft"".So, its a big no for me.

												An innovative take on virtual card games which takes you on an adventure both of your making and of your opponent's. Add the ability to easily gain new cards without needing to pay and multiple games modes, and it's a game you should certainly try out whether or not you have an affinity for card games.

												I am quite new to theese deckbuilding games, The first i tried was ofc  HS when that was new (after beta). I did not really like it that much, it was not bad, just not for me, after that i have tried some others including Magic Duels and such. This is the only one that has kept my interest longer than a few hours. It does have its flaws and has felt quite low on content, but after its recent update with a new hero and completley new mechanics im exited to see what the future brings. IMO this feels much more like a condensed game of talisman then lets say HS.I recomend getting this asp so you can join in and learn before there is to much to learn! (also there is a lot of complaints about the nerfing of one of the Heroes, but you just need to learn a new way to play her)			",345,116,26,65,37,4,51

												TL;DR It's a fun card game with a twist. Instead of using minions to fight eachother you use a hero that you power up in weapons, attack, armour and money.Core gameplay It's not like other cardgames like hearthstone since you don't use minions to fight the other player but you use minions to power up and get money to your hero. You can use money to buy stuff like healing, armour, weapons, attack increase and more. You place out minions and buy stuff until the other hero dies or you go to stage 5. Where you get to power up your hero one last time and then duke it out in a duel. GraphicsYou might think that since it's a card game the graphics are not that important. However since this is more like a walk though diffrent enviroments than a card game it's more important to showcase the enviroments and this is done well. The graphics have a nice ""runescape"" feel to them and in my opinion the graphics look good. It's not crysis 5000 and hyper realistic but it's also not a boring 2d card game.Learning curveThe game does have a tutorial but I wish it was more in-depth on how the game works. It doesn't really teach you about how the stuff in the bottom of the card is what you will get and the top is what damage it will inflict, cost and what health it has.Conclusion: I like this game. I don't see myself playing this all the tim but you gotta check it out. 7/10			",82,5,3,5,10,0,5

												I'm a few hours in, and this game is strong.I'm new to the world of card games, I've only ever touched this and Hearthstone. They're very different games, let's get that straight.Like I said, Chronicle is a strong game. Despite some recent server issues and some heavy handed balancing, the game is fun to play and it has the makings of a world-class title. It needs some work, including more regular updates, but it's a great game at its core.It's got a healthy community. The subreddit is better than the Steam forums (isn't it always?), but everywhere has a reasonable developer presence and people to talk to.It's free, it's not pay-to-win, so give it a shot!

												This game is good. It is not like most CCGs. Many card games try to be like Magic: The Gathering (Hearthstone is guilty of this). Chronicle: RuneScape Legends does not. It is about anticipating what your opponent is going to do. It is about setting up a story for yourself that will land you in a better position than the story your opponent creates for themselves.Don't be misled by how badly this game wishes it were Hearthstone. It has the upper hand on Blizzard's card game in many ways, and is certainly worhy of your time.			",81,41,0,11,3,1,19

												Edit: March 31st, 2017     I NO longer recommend this game. Devs abandoned it thus no player base to play. (You can still play the campaign mode if you want I guess..) I've been playing this game since Closed beta ( November 2015 ) and the game has come along way since then and will only get better with new game modes and new legends/cards to play with! The development team for Chronicles is one of the best dev teams i've ever seen and they 100% percent listen to the player base.You probably will hear or even think to yourself this is an Hearthstone clone and let me tell you now. This game is NOTHING like Hearthstone; In my opinion I think Chronicles is better but of course that will depend on personal perfernce. However in any case; If your a fan of Card games than trying out this game high on your priority list. I Promise you will not regret it!!			",154,36,1,24,7,1,22

												This is my favorite card game...I play it everyday faithfully!  The concept of the game is similar to other card games like Hearthstone but I find myself playing this game and only occasionally going back to Hearthstone.The graphics are beautifully done and the attention to detail in every aspect of this game is front and center...from the playfield to the tokens that represent the player to the voice overs...it all works to make this game visually appealing.The game play is much like other card games and it depends a lot on how you build your decks and the luck of the draw with each hand...but it keeps bringing you back and that's all you can ask of any game.  Keep me coming back for just one more hand...just one more try at defeating just one more player.  I have been with this game throughout...getting it as soon as it was available on Steam and following it throughout it's many additions.  Would I recommend it to a friend....who enjoys this type of game?   A most resounding YES!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far i'm really enjoying this game. It's a card game that also has a bit of luck and at times a bit of skill. With most card games you are dealing with one form of currency, and this one uses multiple forms of currency. In a way, you are also playing against yourself. You can do damage to the other player, but if you pick the wrong cards, the cards you picked may kill you first. When you start a chapter (there are 5, and each chapter allows a maximum of 4 cards), you can place as many creatures as you or put down some kind of support card. Most support cards use gold, but some use armor or health as a currency. Your base attack is 2 at the start, but you can get a support card that gives you a piece of equipment and now you can attack something and kill it faster. While i'm not the best writer, i'm mentioning the basics of the game. Now imagine that you line up your first 4 cards very nicely, you kill a goblin, he gives you 4 gold, now you have support card ready that costs 4 gold. Your next steps were to kill 2 other creatures, you were counting on the fact that it would take 1 hit each to kill each creature as long as you have the weapon, and as long as you have the gold, and by the time you get to the last creature, as long as you still have durability on the weapon by the last creature. Every one of the 4 spots gets handle one after the other alternating between both players.... meaning that if you go first, you reach your first card first, then the other player reaches their card, and it alternates back and forth until you get to each of your 4th cards. Now a player that goes up against another may choose to steal gold, remove armor, or weapon durability, and any of these factors can throw a real wrench in your whole plan. As time goes on you learn how to counter some people, and like  any card game someone will continue to counter you at times. I've really been enjoying the game, and I love playing hearthstone, i've played a bunch of the other card games in the past, but this game has been keeping my focus lately.As of late, there have been some issues with disconnections and the servers but i'm sure those will be taken care of soon like in other games.

												Game is fun, innovative and presents a really interesting spin on the CCG genre. There's a surprising amount of cards and deck combinations you can do, considering the game came out a while ago. The team also seems to be very engaged with making it balanced and fun, wtihout nerfing cards to the point they are no longer usable (looking at you Hearthstone, devs). My only complaint up to this point is that after the newest patch (1.4.0) the servers are ridiculously unstable, not even in peal hours too. They should really do something about fixing that.

												Very fun CCG with a unique combat style.  Matches feel close and unexpected plays can turn a game around quickly.  Acquiring new cards is a bit slow due to the booster pack price, but base cards are more than enough to progress through the early levels of ranked play.  Visuals are nice though the card art is a bit generic.  I recommend this as a great addition to any other CCGs you play.			",43,11,2,6,2,0,6

												This is a great take on a CCG that uses the fact that you are playing it virtually quite well.  You don't fight your opponent directly, instead you are taking your hero on a journy through five ""chapters""/""pages"" where you can play up to 4 events for them. you play all your cards for each page at the same time & they resolve simultaniously.  If that the end of the 5 pages you are both still alive they enter the arena and roshambo until one falls.Worth a look. Fun even with out putting money into it. So you can see if you like it before investing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sure, has some strong ""similarities"" to Hearthstone: both heroes starts with 30 health, game ends when one of them drop below zero, you can have max 10 cards in hand and Arena Run is renamed into ""Dungeoning"" - but IMHO its very general. And there is a lot differences.Instead fighting card-to-card you ""prepare"" lanes. Heroes are more vocalised, they warn you if you about to attack card that will kill them causing you to loose and going first/second doesn't feel much decitive as it feels in Hearthstone (there is no mana bar, so there is no cheap coin/Druid mana cheating cards). Additionally I like detail that cards with remove health effect actually remove health - bypassing armor! ♥♥♥♥ you, Warriors in Hearthstone.The only problem is that card draw can still ♥♥♥♥ you up just like in most card games. Example - you may draw support only cards and first turn and mulligan all of the only to get... support class card again. Its like in Hearthstone when you don't want 8 Mana cost card at start yet on mulligan game decides to give you 8 or more mana card in return. Little about customisation - yes, you can buy card back for real money, however at least you can customise your title and badge for free and only earn new ones when you complete challenge - no buying them!Overall, game worth trying if you are into card games.

												Let me start by saying that I really like this game. It's a card game that is significantly different from the two main themes I've seen in card games: battle each other with creatures and spells until opponents life is depleted, and row allocation of cards to win hands (and gain points or deal damage). This one differs in that each player tries to 'level up' some RPG class hero through 5 sets of playing cards.In Chronicle, you define the adventure your character is having by playing monsters to defeat for gold or upgrades (like weapons, armor, health or raw attack power) or supportive items like weapons and armor and allies or locations. Cards can trigger special effects, such as duelling with the oponent's hero (having them attack each other once) or perhaps casting a spell on the opponents hero, monster or (upcoming) equipment. If both heros survive the trek across these 5 'chapters', they face each other in a final confrontation where the strongest will survive. But if someone happens to die before the other, the surviving hero is victorious.This game also have the traditional tempo-based strategies. Do you intend to cause as much trouble for the opponents hero on their journey, sabotaging their weapons and stealing there gold to make sure they get in a bad shape at the final confrontation? Do you lay traps and prepare ambushes and cast spells at you opponent, causing them to misstep and perhaps die before reaching the end of the last chapter? Or will you in weather the storm with protective gear and helpfull allies and beat your enemy into a red pulp with a big weapon? All are valid strategies to create your deck around.I've found the free to play model implemented in this game fair. You can get a decent set of cards to start with as you gain experience with each hero and doing daily quests, which only a few require you to win games and most just require you  to play the game. The cardset is not too big that starting at the time of writing puts you at a huge options-deficit.Matchmaking is decent enough. In ranked play, I'm often paired against people of similar strength and similar card-pools. And after having created some decent decks myself, I'm at a point where I can beat people with very rare cards without having access to them myself. (Some statistics: you needed around 500 card packs before the release of Movran to complete a cardcollection. This number is higher now after Movrans release. I hope that this statistic gives you some feeling for the size of the cardpool)There is a drafting mode, which I haven't played that much. So I cannot comment on that one. Besides that there is a practice against bots (yields you cards for beating them for the first time!), non-ranked online play, ranked online play and dueling amonst friends.Grapics are okey (looks nice, but I personally suffer from some bugs related to the depth of field rendering), the play-history ingame is realy nice, and gameplay feedback is suffiecient to get the information you needs during play.Personally, this game completely replaced Heathstone for me. I didn't like the pressure I felt in the game to keep up with the sheer volume of new cards they kept cranking out and I didn't play the game frequently enough to make buying packs worth the investment in my regard. I do not feel that pressure with Chronicle. And I'm happy with that. :)			",209,31,0,37,22,0,61

												Great game.Playing as f2p and its still a good challenge, coming from playing HS the card texts are so completely different which makes making decks so much more fun. The mechanics of the game are very enjoyable and the game modes are great. Would highly recommend this to anyone.			",109,19,2,26,10,3,34

												FtP CCG that is not a Hearthstone clone that is better than it ought to be.  I have no experience with Runescape and ran into this browsing steam for card games.  It has unique gameplay and is easy to pick up.  There are 5 characters (legends) with their own card pool plus a general card pool.  The game is played in 5 ""chapters"" with up to 4 cards played by each player.  You lay down cards that your ""legend"" avatar will encounter in sequence for the current chapter.  The cards could be creatures you battle which then earn you gold which you can then spend on equipment or spell cards to buff your legend or deal direct damage to your opposing legend.  You draw 3 new cards each chapter so either utilizing extra card drawyou are forced to make some touch choices.  Also you can't alter the current chapter after you've committed, so if your rival has forced you to take damage, lose weapon durability, or lose gold, you could forfeit equipment or potion card purchases, or take extra damage from creatures you played that turn.The games play super quick maybe 5 minutes long and the production values are high.  IAP include booster packs and cosmetics, I went for the 10-pack starter for about $8.  There is still a ""dungeoneering"" game mode I haven't unlocked that I am guessing gives you chances to earn boosters once per day.			",178,28,4,23,26,2,64

												Great game just nice to see alot of the runescape characters in a card game.But I have to say 2 things:1) I was really dissapointed to see the gwd bosses and some other card as non legendary.2)A major issue for me is that when my opponent discards a card I can't see the card good because its shown for like 0.5 seconds and for noobs its hard to know the stats of a card from knowing only the name.For the rest please keep up this great game jagex!!!

												A decent, different little card game!-----The Good; Completely different from any other card game on the market. I like the art style.The Bad; Like all f2p card games, requires a significant time commitment or a credit card commitment to collect all the cards Can seem a bit like guessing at times with regards to countering/outplaying your opponents.----First of all, don't be put off by the fact this game has ""Runescape"" in the title. It's quite an innovative little game.Each game takes place on a set of boards with four nodes each that each player has a hero walk over. As the player, your job is to populate these nodes with creatures for your hero to battle or items for your hero to buy. As you go you accumulate power for your hero or try to debilitate the enemy hero, leading up to a final battle between the two heroes that determines the winner. It's a great idea!Aside from increasing the power of your own hero you can deal direct damage to the enemy or perhaps sneakily buff the creatures they put on the board to do more damage to them. There's a lot of different ways to approach winning the game.The game has an Arena style buy-in draft mode for the competitive players amongst you, though the entry price is a little high for my liking.Overall, it's worth at least a look because it's free and it's something new. These games do demand a long term commitment from you, and I wasn't prepared to make that, but I still enjoyed the couple hours I spent exploring the mechanics.			",253,51,6,26,15,2,38

												i have played this game as a nice little time filler for a few weeks now. i looked at this because it was free and knew nothin going in. it's unlike anything i think exists before and it's completely different to hearthstone as people keep pointing out. the solo campaign is short but is a good way to get a first few decks. there are currently about 340 cards and you get 5 cards a pack. i have opened about 54 ish packs of cards and have about 260/outa the 340 cards. i do not think this game is pay to win at all as while some cards are definitely strong cards there is enough copper given per day to do an arena run a day or if your a bit casual at least do the epic quest every 4 days for 1000 copper thats a pack every 4 days even if you played 10 games once every 4 days. the issue i am finding is people are failing to realise not to straight up buy decks from the shop as that gets expensive. what you actually want to do on this game is buy arena runs with plat. for 100 plat which is about $1.99 you get 1 arena run which works similar to heathstone. not only do you get 15 rounds of drafting 2 cards out of any card in the game allowingg you to test cards and see what you may want in a premade deck easier. but for every win in arena you can get copper. if you get 7 wins in arena period you get enough copper to buy another free arena run. both arena runs give a pack each by default so you can buy decks for a dollar and potentially win enough to buy another arena run so it can be a dollar for two packs plus about 2 hours of entertainment learning the game and cards. if you get fairly far you also get given shards which are like dust so arena runs can even grind the dust needed for specific cards on top giving you 2 5 card decks and possibly one card of your choice for a dollar each time. i have spent about 10-20 usd on this game and got over 50 packs from chain winning arena. ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the 300 odd usd your paying for one set of hearthstone. gameplay is solid the feelings of pulling off a killing tactic are incredible and its worthy of time even if you have no love or knowledge of the runescape world cause i sure as hell never played runescape.  to make this non bias and more worthy i will list some cons. the price for a few of the legend cards ae a little too high for a dust grind and while you don't need them to win this game will require a lot of time to grind all the cards unless you bought a bunch of packs but you never need to and i've been happy with most of the games cards getting to gold rank and trying to reach plat. classes have varied playstyles and its nice to see the choice but it's also too easy to see the choice. it's far too easy to notice the other players tactic because his whole deck is given away in a card or two.  theres no room for creative decks there are playstyles which have a much higher win rate and i would argue the mage class is way too easy to break and is sorta overpowered. each class does have a counter to the strong tactics but you have to learn fast exactly what your doing and how to block them and that might be a stressful learning curve. once the mage gets 16 gold and there are cards which can give 4 gold then be doubled and doubled again so you could get in theory 16 gold in 1 chapter. then turn 2 you can be hit for 32 damage which is 2 more than lethal. you would need to play smart to take away a mages gold before that combo hits or it's a very quick game.

Player base as of this writing is still on the low-side but there is great potential! Compared to other CCG's on the market such as Hearthstone, this experience is VASTLY different and each game is actually enjoyable EVEN IF YOU LOSE!

												Very different twist on popular games like Hearthstone, the Gameplay is nothign like it but the collection style of cards and the supporting mechanics are comparible.If you play and could/would enjoy hearthstone, I think this game is pretty enjoyable, I don't feel choked out by not having 6 legendaries in my deck or anything like that, the actual way the cards are played is very unique and refreshing original idea (I believe, could be totally wrong and based on something)Worth a try, don't just skip over it and go Ehhh too much like hearthstone, you truly have to play it to understand just how different it is.

												This card game is amazingly fresh!! Much better then expected - I really like the fact that u ""setup"" cards at the same time so if u ""guess"" right u can counter your enemy's move. Tip: I suggest you complete ALL solo opponents FIRST to get 3 card packs + about 1000 coins which can buy you another card pack. - Like in hearthstone there is an arena ( here its called dungeonering).To me its a bit of a mix between Hearthstone and Infity Wars (also very fun and different card game, where u can TRADE cards) and yet with something new added to it. (the fact it got a bit of  RPG feel to it). - I hate to say this (cus of all the money spend on hearthstone) but i think i like this game more then hearthstone. Yes of course it needs  a bit of balance here and there and yes of course there is some bugs - the game is still early stage. No its not pay to win, at least not more than hearthstone is. - There is no Expansion that you need to buy to enjoy the game (as of yet) like there is in hearthstone (solo adventures).Animation/graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8.5/10Replayablility: 10/10Overall i rate this 8.5/10 - It could use 1-3 more classes in my opninon (hope they will add more) but still fun nonetheless.

Awesome game so far. I know it has been said before but is is far from a Hearthstone clone, and that is refreshing.I will not lie, their may be some lack of content currently, but that is to be expected. It is still early on in it's release and Jagex has done a great job in presenting a platform they can build off of in the future. The core gameplay is something unique which really hasn't been done (at least to my knowledge) in many other TCGs. I have seen someone else call it more of a board game than a TCG, which honestly may hold to be true. That is not a knock to the card-based gameplay, as Jagex has done a good job in blending these elements together. Overall, Chronicle is a unique and enjoyable experience. It offers a fresh take on the genre and it is definitely worth a try. The future is bright for Jagex's new game, and I hope more players flock to it over-time. Futhermore, the RuneScape branding should not intimidate anyone. No pre-required knowledge is needed of the world of Gielinor to understand ideas introduced in this game.			",95,29,0,17,7,2,11

Yeah its got glowy cards but thats about it when it comes to comparing to heartstone. You play the game against a rival in 5 different chapters. You go through the chapters playing cards and writing your history. You Try to help your self In preporation for the final fight or you can try to drag your rival down along the way. Plenty of ways to play. Also getting card packs is not too hard. I dont feel like I HAVE to put money into it. However I will. A good game deserves support.			",95,12,1,21,25,2,27

												This will most likely be a review I keep changing as I play the game.First off don't know if it was just my bad luck or it's already the way the game will be but, all the current matches I had were all vs people who already had cards that had more capability than the ones I have(at this point in time it's 45mins of being in game and around 4 to 7 matches all lost since I first started the playing), or people that have already got more then 0 games under their belt and already know of all synergies.Then there is the fact this game feels more like pay to win, sorry to be more accurate pay to get ahead, the amount of time needed to grind the copper needed to buy 1 pack ( copper is 1 of the two currencies this one being the grind one) to me it seems like it's longer than HS (yes I will be comparing this game with other games deal with it), considering you get money when you win and when you lose you get squat so far from what I have seen could have been me again being unlucky but the cards that I unlock when the class I was playing lvls up were so far always class specific cards meaning no monster to generate the gold coins you use in match meaning no way to vary the deck.Now that my two complains are out of the way sure people should play this sure they will instantly hit a wall that makes them bias to buying cards with plat other wise they wins squat, this game looks fun but alot of people will be annoyed at the way it currently is (with this I mean you will be losing alot of games to people that have cards you don't making you want to buy cards) with that said meet you in the game.

												Buying girlfriend 1 gp! But seriously though this is a fun little game made by Jagex set in the fantasy world of Gielinor (Runescape) quite different to other card games, the game allows the player to play as a legend these include some of the characters which were added to runescape back in 2011 such as Raptor, Ozan and Ariane as well as a few others from recent years.The two players must select cards in which will determine what will happen within the game for instance placing a creature card doesnt cost anything, the players selected legend will fight the creature and recieve benefits such as extra damage, health or gold additionally there are support cards which the gold can be used on for example a set of adamant armour costs one gold (obviously not like the game where it is a few thousand xD) this will then give the legend extra armour. Each card is based on items and NPC's within the game for example Dragon longswords and saradomin brews however there are some cards which are simply just abilities for instance Raptor has a card which allows him to give up some of his armour to do damage to his opponent.The players must try to indirectly kill each other through 5 stages by killing creatures with effects for example killing a scorpion will deal damage to your rival, if neither player dies by the end of stage 5 they then take turns hitting each other kind of like oldschool runescape combat all the stages are taken from the game for example Lumbridge, The grand exchange, Barrows and the mage tower.All in all I think this is a great f2p game and whilst booster packs can be purchased for real money I see no real benefit of doing so.Also this game beats RS3 anyday of the week.P.S im an 11/12 year Runescape vetaran with over 6000 hours invested into the game  :)			",133,13,4,19,10,0,12

												It's a interesting game but seems to suffer from the fact that it's still new with a small community. Also the gameplay so different it's hard to imagine what non-casual play would look like.First it's a good idea the game play is you have a hand full of monsters and buffs that you place in front of your hero to battle and recive the benifits from 4 cards at a time. This get interesting when you mess with the opponents path stealing things from them or damging them enough to kill them before you get to the 5th chapter that has the two opponenets fight using the buffs and equipment gained.With that said this early into the game i had fun playing the standard decks but my biggest problem is i can't imagine what higher level play will be like. Games like hearthstone and dueylest have such simple mechanics looking through the cards you can craft leads to some obvious decks like aggro or combo decks. With this game there seems to be some themed cards like the pirate cards comboing with ships or obvious objectives like the theif steals and the tank armors up. Besides that its hard to picture without having spent a good amount of time spent playing the game and understanding what all is possible and what are viable tactics.also the amount to get packs seems pretty high.In the end i would love to see this game get a good comminity and really grow but if you're a filthy casual like me who only plays every so often you might want to let it develop before jumping on board.

												When i saw this as a card game i just thought competing with heathstone will be pointless and a waste of time. Im going to leave a helpful review since i just see alot of trolls and people that chat crap. 8/10Pro's: Very addictive once you get the hang of the gameSince it's new you have a chance to expereiment with all kinds of deck styles and synergies and create a meta.Quick fast games (faster then your typical card games) Nothing seems too op yet or out the ordinary (from my experience) Cons:hard to understand at first takes a couple of games to get the hang of the gameplayneed to play a few AI games (simular to starting on hearthstone) to gain a few cards/packs.You can earn coins so im sure there is P2W involved. Will defo keep playing as it leaves an alternate game apart from hearthstone to play and waste time on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have time on your hands I recommend playing this as you get sucked into it pretty quickly, pretty fun and unique for a take on a tcg. The only problem is the pricing on packs otherwise it is done really well.  Fear the penguins.			",111,10,0,16,5,2,14

												I don't play card games because I think it is boring, just calculating those values to win. However, this game has animation. The whole system is like going to a journey, unlike a table with cards. I like it.			",54,10,0,3,5,0,1

												Overall:  Interesting strategy game that draws your interest but bogged down by slow animations.  It's an online CCG that feels more like a competitive board game than something like hearthstone and Magic.  However, the slow animations and super long turn timers mean it might be better and faster as a board game.  I strongly recommend trying this game if you can do something productive during the animations.  Bring a book, have netflix on in the background, etc.I do not recommend this game for people who prefer tightly designed cards (this one is swingy) or if you prefer more active time.(note:  due to a Steam bug i'm playing this using the Jagex Client)Pro:Very interesting build-you-own-hero dynamic.There is a ""limited"" draft version that is very fun and costs the free currency to play.  This can truly be F2P (though I've spent)Game does a good job of assisting you to not make stupid mistakes (playing a card that'll kill you, not having the effect go off as planned)  Developer seems to do a great job following up on issuesCon:In each rougly 10+ minute game There is 5 points where decisions are made, and these take less than 30 seconds each.  Games are very very long due to long animation times.Matchmaking is suspect and slow.Cards are very swingy, especially in the draft mode.  This CCG has a much stronger luck element than others due to the way you chain your cards.  A lucky interruption can mean the game.			",74,29,1,25,5,3,39

												Buying girlfriend 1 gp! But seriously though this is a fun little game made by Jagex set in the fantasy world of Gielinor (Runescape) quite different to other card games, the game allows the player to play as a legend these include some of the characters which were added to runescape back in 2011 such as Raptor, Ozan and Ariane as well as a few others from recent years.The two players must select cards in which will determine what will happen within the game for instance placing a creature card doesnt cost anything, the players selected legend will fight the creature and recieve benefits such as extra damage, health or gold additionally there are support cards which the gold can be used on for example a set of adamant armour costs one gold (obviously not like the game where it is a few thousand xD) this will then give the legend extra armour. Each card is based on items and NPC's within the game for example Dragon longswords and saradomin brews however there are some cards which are simply just abilities for instance Raptor has a card which allows him to give up some of his armour to do damage to his opponent.The players must try to indirectly kill each other through 5 stages by killing creatures with effects for example killing a scorpion will deal damage to your rival, if neither player dies by the end of stage 5 they then take turns hitting each other kind of like oldschool runescape combat all the stages are taken from the game for example Lumbridge, The grand exchange, Barrows and the mage tower.All in all I think this is a great f2p game and whilst booster packs can be purchased for real money I see no real benefit of doing so.Also this game beats RS3 anyday of the week.P.S im an 11/12 year Runescape vetaran with over 6000 hours invested into the game  :)			",133,13,4,19,10,0,12

												At first I thought it was another HS clone. But it isn't at all, other than how the cards look. The game has a unique simple mechanic for fights. Interesting to see how the fights evolve over each turn. Each character has its own playstyle that works best for him/her. Nothing seems OP and best of all it is NOT pay to win in any way.

												Is this game going to be the next big e-sport? Probably not, but it is a lot of fun. The similarities it shares with Hearthstone pretty much end at them both being a card game (and there being resources like health, as well). Other than that, the format is completely different. Instead of attacking your opponent directly and clearing their minions in order to survive, you're trying to build a hero that will beat their hero. You're basically sending them on a journey; supporting them with supplies and giving them creatures to fight, so they'll grow stronger. At the end, the grand battle happens and the last man standing wins! Of course there's spells you can use to try to kill your opponent's hero earlier than that, but without those that's the basic flow of the game. So if you're interested in CCGs with strategy/RPG elements then give it a go! It's free and it'll certainly be worth 30 minutes of your time.			",159,42,2,27,19,0,25

												Great card game with a new take on CCG's. Stigma of RuneScape is easily brushed off and isn't a requirement to play / know much about it to get involved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thought it would be another hearthstone clone, I was totally wrong. The game is fun, has nothing to do with runescape aside from the card art, and plays totally different from any tcg ive ever played. highly recomend it.			",83,10,1,14,11,0,14

												In short: Not Hearthstone. More like Rat Race, the card game. Throw sticks at your enemies while you chug stims and survive the final battle, unless you beat him first.Good for: Anyone, I guess. It is free, looks nice and plays like no card game I know.Bad for: Blizzard fanboys who hate how much the art style resembles Heartstone.			",132,19,1,32,35,1,40
