												Aside from this game being a guilty pleasure, it is actually really fun. It looks quite good visually, has a really solid fighting system, and a very unique rewind mechanic that keeps the gameplay interesting. In addition, the voice acting and dialog is so bad it's legendary. Highly Recommended.			",766,304,6,72,33,4,21

												In overall, everything about this game is awesome. Controls are smooth, gameplay is fast, decent graphics and sounds, the time-control spell makes this game particular. In my opinion, the story is a bit lame, but I do not really care, I forget it when I swing my swords in every directions :P. Collectibles are very easy to find during your walkthrought because maps are not that large, so no time wasted for that, just make sure to use compass. Great game to smash everything moving.

												This is actually not a bad game.  It's much better than the predecessor 'X-Blades' which isn't even worth your time.  That's not to say it doesn't have flaws, but overall I had fun with it, and it kept my interest long enough to play through it twice.Gameplay is pretty standard hack n slash fare, with two attack buttons and a variety of magical skills you can use fluidly along with your swords.  You also carry a gun you can whip out at any time if you like, and while the third-person shooting may not be as advanced as something like Gears of War, it works and it's easy to use.  There's also an interesting time control mechanic where you can rewind time and fight alongside past versions of yourself.  You'll also use this ability to solve puzzles, although none of them are terribly difficult.There isn't a lot of variety in the enemies, but mowing down hordes of them is still good for some mindless action, and when they do change it up you'll have to adapt your approach accordingly.The visuals are gorgeous in this game.  The sound design is excellent as well.  The characters however, are kind of shallow (the main character in particular is really annoying), and the story is pretty difficult to follow.  These things aren't the main focus of the game though: the gameplay is.  And the gameplay that is there is solid, and there are many unique game environments to make your way through.  All things considered, this is a pretty decent game.			",802,239,27,63,64,8,118

												Score: 7/10This game is in the same vein as God of War or Legacy of Kain. The blade combos are basic XXX or YYY style. This doesn't actually matter though since the real key here is the magic powers you gain throughout the game. It's not really the voice actors fault as most people say, but actually the script they were given to read. You play Ayumi a treasure hunter so its natural you would be seeking treasure, but the games dialogue tends to beat you over the head with it so hard that it is really annoying. I mean your gaining magic powers and Ayumi remains conserned over treasure until the very end. With magic powers you don't need treasure would be a logical way of though along with why am I getting these powers?The controls are pretty solid for the most part. The only real issue is the instances when you push the counter button and nothing happens. The enemies don't change a ton, but it wasn't bad either. The gunplay is actually very nicely done as well. The later levels add in a new type of gunplay which I've seen before in Darksiders where you get a powerful gun on the floor for certain fights which adds good variety.The level design is fantastic. The puzzles aren't that challenging but they help mix up the gameplay. You go from a volcano to a winter scene and your characters clothing changes depending on where you are. The garden level of the skygods is probably the best looking, but the others don't lag to far behind.The story itself is better then most people claim. The main issue is your characters lack of interest in it. The notes along the way really help flush it out as well. Everything gets put into place by the end of the game. The ending does solve a lot of problems but it also ampifies your characters lack of believable emotion.Overall it's a fun game and I would almost say it is criminally under rated by the mainstreem review websites. I'm not saying you'll play it more then once, but it's a great game to pick up for a few bucks.			",647,319,15,99,47,6,79

												Alright.. I love this game.1. Hot chick with twin blade and guns!!2. Time rewind to create more of you at once!!3. Wonderful graphics with awesome cinematic kill animation!!4. Engaging story with dragon power!!5. You can fly at times!!6. Defense of the ancient kinda of multiplayer!!7. Magic and more Magic Upgrades!!8. DLC extra game with another hot chick!!9. More if I can just think straight right now...Anyhow Jokes aside. This is really a good game with a lot wonderful points. Combat magic and time rewind combat can be abused to change the gameplay drasticly even though it does take a bit of learn curve to get use to. For a game made 4 years ago this still remain a wonderful advanture hack/slash/shooter game.8.5/10.. If you got this in your library and never played it.. play it.. now!

												This is a really curious game. It's as if someone took a bad game and tried to polish the living daylights out of it: this game is really pretty. The platforming is slippery and tempermental, but the combat is incredibly satisfying and fun, the voice acting is bland and bad (But you can change the language), the story makes absolutely no sense until the end (Although I did actually enjoy not knowing what was going on in this for some reason), the world design is way too over-designed, but I don't know if I can actually complain about that. The characters are terrible (In the best way), the music is good, not outstanding.But from a gameplay perspective, it is really fun. Especially when you have all the power-ups and are setting people on fire and freezing them, then rewinding time, letting your past self do all of the hard work while you take pot shots at the rest, then rewinding time AGAIN (I think you can have up to 5 time-clones of yourself) to finish them off with an explosion and stabby stabby times. I'd recommend it, but I'm still scratching my head over the game. It shouldn't be enjoyable, but as a B-movie sort of vibe, I loved it.			",51,16,0,15,3,0,7

												I really enjoyed this game overall besides one frustrating puzzle; it took me 25minutes to figure out lol.Graphics are nice, and the combat and abilities are smooth :) The puzzles and levels are great fun (especially with your time resets).Every boss has different rotations and mechanics in order to beat it - It was fun to learn each one.Nothing really bad to say besides that one puzzle....  Voice acting on main character was not as bad as everyone says... I think it was more of the actual script itself; it was kind of funny.I would recommend this game! 9/10			",57,12,0,6,3,0,1

												Disclaimer: I'm only 2 hours into the game so far (3rd 'world').Blades of Time was something I picked up on a lark while it was on sale. The fact that it was from the people who made X-Blades (never played, but it looks really fanservicey) and checking a few reviews made it seem mediocre. I was wrong. This game is wonderful.Don't get me wrong, it is flawed. Graphics aren't great and the controls aren't as tight as you'd want in a 3rd person platform/hack and slash game but the core mechanics: adding powers to your character, the combat combo system, ranged combat and melee combat all feel great. The real shining point, however, is the time manipulation.In games like Prince of Persia, you rewind time to recover from mistakes. Here, you rewind time, which locks you in place and rewinds everything ELSE in the world. Then, there are two copies of you running around. Your former self just continues to do whatever it was that you did at that time, and enemies AI kicks back in.An example of this is if you wanted, you could copy yourself a bunch and all have them aim rifles, shooting at a tree. Then make a final copy which kites the bad guy over to where the shots are happening. It's unlikely that you'd need to do this, but it's possible!Anyway if you see this game on sale, grab it. It's not going to push the boundries of PC gaming, gaming or even your expectations of games, but it will provide you a solid amount of *fun*.			",668,204,16,97,60,7,97

Combat system is pretty simple, I like the spell combos, not too hard to learn. It's also very action packed, theres no moment where u get bored. The ending definitely needed more work done but the rest of the game is fine. Overall an overlooked game that deserves a playthrough!			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

												This turned out to be a pretty fun action game, though it took a while to get going and I didn't like it as much as, say, Marlow Briggs.Ayumi has, unfortunately, only one basic melee attack that you just keep spamming to work up your ""rage meter"", which then lets you fire off spells. There's also a Dash move for dodging and closing the distance, and you can switch to a ranged weapon which significantly slows you down and makes you unable to Dash. Once an enemy is at low health, you have the option to perform a finishing move - or just keep wailing on them until they go down. There is also ""kick"" to break blocks that you rarely need to use. All in all, it's pretty uninspiring until you get enough spells to spice up the combat, and really start using the Rewind Time ability.Rewind Time is actually pretty interesting - it rewinds the world around you, while leaving your character alone. Your character's position and any damage you've taken still stays, so you can't ""undo"" fatal mistakes like you could in the Prince of Persia games.  Rewinding Time creates a ""time clone"" of you, that then proceeds to go through all the actions you've taken during those ""rewound"" seconds. So you could unload half a rifle clip at a charging enemy, rewind time as they get close, and then continue shooting. Their health will be back to where it was at the beginning, but they'll start taking double damage because there will now be two of you shooting! This is actually required for some enemies who are surrounded by magical force fields that can only be broken by extremely concentrated hails of bullets.  Rewind Time is also used for some basic puzzles, such as when multiple pressure plates/switches must be triggered at the same timeMost bosses require some strategy to defeat, but it's usually not hard to figure out, and serves as a nice change of pace.You start with the double-jump, which is always appreciated.  As you proceed in the plot, you unlock new spells & abilities, find new equipment (a magical compass pointing the direction of any nearby equipment chest is very useful), and demolish boatloads of enemies. TL;DR - Fun game once you get enough spells/abilities to make the combat less boring, just don't expect something on the level of Devil May Cry, God of War, or even Marlow Briggs.

												Blades of time, You play the role of Ayumi who is a duel wielding sword user who is out to find treasure in the mysterious world of Dragon land. While looking for treasure you unfold a story of immortal beaning, chaos, humans, and other unknown creatures in this beautifully design world.While this game is your tipcial hack n slash game. You are gifted with the powers of magic and time. You are able to rewind time back and use your ""clones"" to help kill certain monsters or help figure out puzzles.Blades of time doesn't try to push the bar to stand out. However this game does have it's pros and cons.The combat in blades of time flows very nicely and is quite fun. However the combat does get repetitive quite often. One of the best things about this game are the boss fights. They feel like they are really boss fights and you can't just go in hack n slash like alot of games. You will need to watch the boss and whats around you to over come them.The world which you play in is very beautifully and colourfully, every level you go to has it's over feel and look to it.The music for this game is pretty good.The character design them self is solid nothing great but nothing bad. With Ayumi her voice at the start of the game did get annoying and it felt like she talked to much and that she had something to say about every little thing that happen. i felt like she needed to tone back on some of the things she talked about.The weapons are limted in this game. You have your main weapons the sword, and your off weapon a rifle. While your able to find other items like rings and amulets to give you added bonuses. To find most of these items to you, you will need to use the compus ayumi has to find hidden chest in the game. Whenever you are near by a chest the compus will glow on the back side of ayumi. Once you pull it out you will see a red arrow that will guide you to the hidden chest. However the one thing i did not like was. The chest could be above you, or under you and it will point to where it's at but doesn't let you know if it's above or under you. So you end up trying to find it and then get tired of searching to find out it was else where. The overall controlls for this game is pretty decent. However using a mouse even when turning down the sentivity doesn't seem to help much. If you are wanting to play this game i recommand using a game pad over the keybored and mouse.When in the options if you want to change anything for textures, or ajuest your mouse. you have to reluanch the game before it will take effect.The story.... well it's a story and it's not really amazing but not really horrible either. it's better than some games ive played but overall it's an ok story.Overall i think this game is really fun, it has it moments that make you wanna rage but it a good way, enough rage to kept you wanting to push thru and keep playing. the over all world is just very nice to look at and has a great feel. this game is pretty lineard.the over all score i would give it would be a 7 out of 10.

Alright! Time for another review.So I've been playing Blades of Time, and as an Hack'n'Slash lover, this game surprised me.This is a very addictive game, not because of its story, or voice acting, its puzzles, or anything in particular, but when you start playing it just keeps you glued to it, for short to medium periods of time, but you always need to come back for more. This is only until you finish the main storyline.So, what does the game do well and not so well? Here's a list for you:Pros: Fun fighting, quick and rather easy to pulloff combos* (see in Cons); Weapons (such as rifles and cannons) for long range engagements; Very distinct areas, a wide variety of sights to amuse yourself and fight your way through; Decent and somewhat interesting bossfights; Hidden chests and rewards spread all over the world as you go through the levels, be on the lookout for those as they hold new equipment* (see in Cons) Rather interesting main character (Ayumi), as time goes on you start to develop more interest in her intentions and motivation to go on.Cons: Not the best special abilities, since they're all the same, but with different side effects (burning, or freezing your enemies, etc.) Some frustrating fights (arenas and/or mini boss fights); Not the best graphical fidelity, but has its good moments; A lot of the enemy characters look the same and dress the same; Weak voice acting, at least in English tongue (in Japanese seems to be better) The rewards you get from hidden chests or bossfights, only have a different stat (e.g. you can have a pair of swords that Increases fire damage and another pair that has a different model but instead gives you Freezes enemies for a longer period), the same goes for rings, amulets, but it's slightly more in-depth when it comes to weapons though; Some of the puzzles might be frustrating to finish and some you might even have to take a wild guess in order to proceed to the next area, as sometimes you have no clue or explanation on what to do.Extras:Despite the longer Cons list, I really enjoyed this game.I didn't mention the storyline above, because it's up to you to love it or hate it. I didn't find it amazing, but it's not bad either if you like the gameplay, you'll go along with the story too. Also, the storyline might last you around 8 hours depending on how many secrets you find and the difficulty you play on.The puzzles are decent, and there are a few of them here and there. Not great, not bad, some are quick and some are frustrating.The multiplayer looks interesting, but it's not working (or at least there isn't anyone playing). It's a shame truthfully, looks really fun and somewhat innovative imho.If you happen to catch this game on sale or in a bundle, grab it if you can!And that's it, if you like Hack'n'Slash games, you'll like this one, it's no Devil May Cry, but it's decent enough to give it a go. After all, you're playing this to kill everything around you, right?			",376,50,23,37,25,4,37

												Wow!!! Even by 2012 I thought it was impossible to innovate a hack and slash adventure game. I love the genre, but I just like the colors and combo strategy, I thought God of War covered the good stuff. And then I found this. Another lost gem that faded into non-existence because it's not a major AAA developer. Let me explain myself...The best part about this is the time warp system. This is TOO FREAKING COOL! I'd suggest buying this game JUST to experience this mechanic. It's difficult to be innovative in modern gaming, so it's possible it had been done before and I just missed it, but either way it is incredibly fun. Basically you can reverse time in fairly short increments, but your ""past avatar"" will still exist doing what you just did while your ""present  avatar"" is free to do whatever. You can make several of these avatars at once to fight alongside you or help you solve puzzles. It's a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it you can't wait to use it again. How it works is say you have a group of 3 enemies. You can take out your gun and blast away for 5 seconds at one of them while they charge you. Reverse 6 seconds. Your past avatar will now be there shooting at that same enemy. So now you have a few choices. You can use your present avatar to keep shooting at the same enemy, reverse time 6ish seconds again, shoot at that enemy, repeat however many times you want, and then suddenly have 5+ people blasting this enemy away in 2 seconds. Or you can use another avatar to shoot a second enemy, making them stumble or holding them back. Now you have 2+ avatars distracting two enemies, so you can charge in with your main avatar using swords and melee on the third. To top it off, after, say, 3 seconds of meleeing that third mob, you can reverse 4ish seconds, and now you'll have both your past and present avatar wailing away at this mob. Repeat however many times you want. You now effectively have 4+ warriors on the battlefield attacking at the same time, and even though the process took place over 20 seconds, once you reverse to the very start of the battle and continue time, all 3 mobs will drop dead in an instant.It's awesome.The next best thing are the puzzles. FINALLY I find another game with unique puzzles that actually make you think without being outrageously difficult just for the sake of being difficult. And it's none of the usual ""do this kind of puzzle once then use it a bunch more times."" Instead, they draw elements from previous puzzles but add a twist or two to keep it fresh. I still haven't beaten it, but as of now I've encountered 3 different ""types"" of puzzles and each one has been expanded upon later in the ""level"" to make it feel new. Well done.The next best thing is the graphics. Graphics are normally the least of my worries and something I'll glance at, appreciate, and move on. But considering the time period and developer, this game is INCREDIBLE! It absolutely stands up to some of today's games but is beautifully optimized. It baffles me how a game from 2012 can look, and more importantly run, 1000% smoother than a game from 2015.Third I'll go with the boss fights. Again, FINALLY a game that has unique bosses that, again, require you to think and stay focused. Not every single one, some are the typical slash away without getting hit, but others do require specific strategies. And hey the strategies aren't always necessary either. You CAN slash away at this boss for an incredibly difficult 20 minutes, but if you learn how to exploit weaknesses, you can take them down in a few attack runs.Next would be the combat. Not the most innovative aspect of the game, but still a tried and true method that is just as fun as it always is. It starts off pretty generic, but once you start unlocking combos it exponentially increases the fun and some are unique enough to make Blades of Time stand out amongst its God of War and Dynasty Warrior peers. And this is where the time warp mechanic comes in. Just like I was saying with the puzzles, it takes an old mechanic and makes it new again. It's also a good balance between simple and difficult. You cannot just stand there and spam left mouse button. You will die. Though you don't necessarily have to be constantly in motion 100% of the time either...in a good way. You CAN be and it makes it that much more fun, but it isn't completely necessary, which I prefer. I like to jump around a bit and get in hits here and there, then wail away at a single enemy, then jump around a bit more.However I'll finish off with the voice acting and story. To be fair I actually do enjoy the storyline. Maybe it's not pulitzer prize winning, but it is somewhat unique compared to most fantasy games. Unfortunately, as others have noted, the voice acting is horrendous. I actually laugh pretty much any time anyone says anything because it feels so...fake and out of place. You can tell this is where they cut the budget from. If you've ever played an Oblivion or Skyrim mod where the creator did their own voice acting...it's kind of like that. Just awkward with mediocre writing where it's almost difficult to actually pay attention to what they're saying and not how they're saying it.But overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes action games, and DEFINITELY anyone who loves hack and slash games. I am actually quite stingy with prices, so t's difficult to say if it's worth $25. I almost NEVER spend more than $15 on a game. Though $25 on Steam for a 4 year old game is somewhat of a testament to the game's quality. However if it's on sale under $15 I wouldn't even hesitate to add it to your cart. If that extra $10 isn't a big deal to your wallet, then yeah I'll definitely give the go ahead for $25.Blades of Steel 8/10 would do time warp againAnd if you're wondering, I actually got it in one of those ""10 Premium Steam Keys"" for $1.12 at a certain third party retailer site. I gotta say I got some pretty good games in those bundles, I'd say it's worth getting 1 or 2 if you're looking for something new to try.			",181,22,0,29,14,0,21

												Simply beautiful, I'm not sure about multiplayer but this game is very fun playing singleplayer. Simple hack and slash like God of War and Devil may Cry. My pc is not amazing and it can run 60+ FPS on every max out.Well after playing it for a while I realized something about this game. Which is over used same character models for the enemy. Other than that I really have no complaints about this game.			",498,145,15,64,46,4,54

												This game is overlooked. Imagine Shadow Of Mordor but without an open world element. Now imagine an interesting story line with some voice acting that does its best to make fun of the main characters hair color. The game play definitely nails it on this one.You start off as an adventurer going to Dragon Land in search of treasure. Obviously things aren't as they seem and you run into foes of all sorts. One's that stalk in the shadows to big bosses that will have you dashing, sort of flying, and dodging every which way. The game does a good job mixing up enemies and tries not to bombard the player with boring old schemes. The game is sort of like Too Human where you fight multiple enemies and can attack them with varying sequences. X is the button to attack with your swords while pushing in the right thumb stick will equip your gun (which can be modified or changed as the game progresses given you are picking up the treasures along the way). This is where it get's interesting though : along the way altars are available that give you certain abilities that you are able to choose from (such as using fire, ice, or a slide attack technique). For instance, if there is a lot of enemies you can press B then X to unleash a fire attack. To do these special attacks however your character needs enough ""rage"" to be built. This is done by attacking enemies. With rage other special attacks are available or you may choose to heal yourself. The diversity in the attacks hasn't put me to boredom yet. Right button when a player is injured enough will put the player into an animation (some sort of decapitation involving the foe). This is the best part though and why the game is called Blades of Time... within the game by pressing left button the player is able to rewind time and rewind themselves and their foes. Yes, you rewind your player but your player is immobile and doesn't move as time is rewound. This means that even though you attacked one foe already, you can rewind time, then play it forward again and have two of your characters (of one you control) attack the enemy. This process can be repeated sort of by will after it's learned. Heck if you want you can keep rewinding and have one of your characters attack him with blades, one with a gun, one with specials etc... it is possible. The game's difficulty is also at an appropriate level. The visuals are appealing (very appealing I'd imagine for single guys) and screen format is available in 1980X1080 settings. Graphics are not the greatest thing in the world but will not get in the way of game play.Sounds are alright. The voice acting makes the main character seem like a ditz though in some of the things that she says. I have no problem with it, I'm not sure if the devs were going for that but that's what it feels like to me. I'd listen to a bit of the dialogue and have to ask myself ""did she honestly just say that""? The gameplay by far though is the best thing about this game. How they managed to use time as a weapon was cool especially allowing the player to deal extra damage to difficult opponents. I got this game in a humble bundle and unless it REALLY REALLY appeals to you I suggest buying it at full price, either than that maybe wait for a sale.

												It lost a lot of the original charm of X-Blades by making it a more realistic art style and giving the main character a different voice actor, but it's still fun. At least she could afford pants this time around.			",187,39,11,14,16,1,9

												This game is definitely worth your time. It not only utilizes interesting time rewinding mechanics, but also provides solid classical slasher experience.UPD: The price for this game is quite high in a lot of regions, but you may want to get it on sale or ask someone to get it for you.

												Blades of Time was a gem that I did not expect it to be. Blades of Time is a completely linear style third person game about a blonde female character, Ayumi, and her journey in an alternate land. The story is a little mroe intriguing than I thought although there were certain parts and characters I was expecting more development on. In Blades of Time, you are able to freeze attack, fire attack, strong attack, and dash as some of the abilities you can use. Your main weapon is a two katanas and you are also presented a gun later which can be used strategically.However, the most appealing part of the game is the time rewind part. Time rewind allows you to create essnetially ""clones"" of yourself that fight while you can still fight. In one semi-boss, I just kept creating more and more clones onto the semi-boss to the point where I had enoug damage to kill the semi-boss in the eqvuialence of 5 seconds. Obviously I had a lot of clones hitting him, but you get the point. Time rewind is also necessary to complete some puzzles that advance the level and some enemies actually require you to time rewind to kill. It is such a unique and interesting concept that I'm surprised Blades of Time 2 hasn't come out yet.The graphics of this game are pretty beautiful although some things get repeated a little too often. But other than some repated things (doors, enemies, and lever like things, etc), the environment is beautiful and the world is very beautiful as well. However, the graphics can be a little intensive to computers that cannot handle high demanding games. I have a gaming laptop and sometimes it still lagged hard.Overall, I highly recommend Blades of Time for anyone who likes to play third person games. Also, just on a side note: you never actually have to pay full price for this game because there is a perpetual bundle on bundlestars featuring this game and some others for only $2.99 which you can find here: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/rpg-heroes-bundle For a small $2.99 price, whoever doesn't buy this is losing out largely...Rating: 8.8/10			",1009,366,27,101,102,10,123

												While the dialogue is poorly executed (at least in English), the combat in Blades of Time offers enjoyable button mashing.  If you can keep track of which Prince of Persia or Devil May Cry entries may work on your computer then you'll probably want to purchase them instead, but this plays much better than Garshasp.  I'm curious to see how the previous telling, X-Blades, holds up.Where Blades of Time seems to shine is in its Outbreak mode.  This is a MOBA variant which can be played either cooperatively or between teams.  There's a catalog of items/effects to earn and I appreciate having an entry in the genre with decent gamepad controls.  Unfortunately, there is little online competition despite some enthusiasm in the Steam forum.  There is, however, a single player mode where most of the same awards can be earned.  If my review sounds too vague, it's because I've been playing short sessions of this for so long I've forgotten the subtleties of the campaign.Dumb story aside, Blades of Time's real cardinal sin is the placement of checkpoints before cutscenes instead of after.  There's a button to skip through them, but it's still annoying after a dozen deaths in a boss fight.I wouldn't bother getting the Dismal Swamp DLC on its own.  The included mission removes character abilities in favor of allies to protect.  An Outbreak map might also be included, but if that's what you're after then you might as well get the Limited Edition for the Sky Islands one as well.			",809,175,6,67,43,6,106

												3rd person, action, adventure, hack and slash game.In this game you play as female warrior - treasure hunter. You are thrown into the game pretty much right after cinematic intro, with not much explanation on what happened before it. Game doesn't have that great of a story, but somewhat compensates with decent, challenging combat and easy on the eyes main heroine.Visuals are average with not that great texture quality and effects. Voice acting is decent enough. Animation quality is not that great, and there is a lot of clipping, skewing and stretching in the combat animations. Level and environment design is good, though low resolution textures is an issue. Apart from that, game is fun little hack and slash experience, with addition to few magic spells and rewind time abillity.Character customization available through melee and ranged weapons, costumes and miscellaneous jewelry items, that you get from chests you find. If it's cheap or on discount, get it.			",228,36,5,24,35,0,27

												If you're looking for a simple action game to kill some time this is it. Grab a PS3/360 controller and for one afternoon you can rewind time and hack things to bit without worrying about complex item systems or perfect skill trees.I found the protagonist's monologues somewhat interesting. She feels human and you can tell what she's thinking makes sense. The voice acting is a bit of a miss but it's not unbearable.It's just corridors filled with enemies and some pretty basic fights but hey, simple action game, that's what you get. Grab it under $10 if you like the genre and you'll be pleasantly surprised.DLC isn't really worth it though, just an extra mission without the neat mechanics that lasts under an hour.

												A game with a story full of more holes and unexplained happenings than Swiss cheese, but the game and combat itself is so fun you won't care. Combat is super fluid and hyper mobile, everything cancellable into everything else, and the time rewind function allows you to fight alongside an army of your own clones that will all repeat your actions, including magic and combos, allowing for an impressive amount of screen filling VFX spamming power. There is no block button, but thats's fine, because you'r etoo busy flyig and dashing aorund and stabbing everything and blowing it up with magic.Puzzles are minimal and generally rely on timed button pressing with the use of the time rewind mechanic. Game is 100% linear with some small collectibles that try to flesh out the happenings, but honestly, it doesn't really matter in this case. Nothing really gets explained except for one story point you can see coming from the opening scenes of the game. Story shouln't be why you play the game though - it'll be for the impressive hack and slash combat. If I had to give the game some downsides: Platforming elements are a little shaky since jump momentum is awkward, and the upgrades and loot items really aren't all that impressive,  save for the jump to level 2 spells, which is incredibly impressive.Game has a multiplayer mode, but apparently it's dead and I didn't touch it, no clue there.Fans of action games, this is right up your alley. A roughly 8-10 hour romp of solid, fun combat.			",315,49,6,73,19,0,73

												With some of the worst voice acting in the industry, terrible storytelling, writing, as well as story in general and clunky, unresponsive gameplay, this is one of the worst games I have played in the past years.The bad:-Terrible voice acting (Main character literally won't shut up and is annoying beyond belief).-One of the worst most uninteresting stories I've seen around, most of the time you don't even know what's going on-Mediocre graphics at best that vary hugely between decent and just outright terrible.-Gameplay is inconsistent, more times than you will wish your character wont properly dash away or button prompts won't work when you would expect them to.-A lot of useless and imbalanced attacks.-Terrible camera that will make you get hit from behind a lot of times from enemies that just spawn behind your back.-Repetitive. Hitting the same enemies for hours.-Terrible ""puzzles"" as well as terrible platforming that doesn't work like it should.-Aim-assist on controller screws you over more than it helps.-Lackluster multiplayer that had huge lag issues in my experience.The good:-When the gameplay works it's decently fun. Too bad that isn't the case most of the time.-The time rewind mechanic works pretty well and is rather fun, however is sadly underutilized and mostly just server to press buttons simultaneously or walk through a door while your other copy opens it.Stay away from. There is a lot of better games in this genre that deserve your attention more. Even though it's a budget title there is just nothing here that warrants a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blades of Time is a classic slasher game similar to Prince of Persia series in many ways, utilizing but not coping mostly all of its features - intriguing plotline, acrobatic tricks, dynamic battles with lots of unique enemies, possibility to reverse time to solve puzzles or to defeat mob hoards and tough bosses.Game has quite predictable but decent storyline, beautiful locations and good overall graphics as well as proper animations for characters and ambient, lots of gameplay features, such as combos, guns and magic, simple RPG elements with possibility to use different gear with unique properties, long enough campaign and interesting ‘Outbreak mode’ featuring dota-like gameplay but in the third person mode.Fighting system much easier to learn and use then in other games, you don’t really need to focus on combos and ‘perfect’ attacks, missing few hits wont make current battle much harder or even impassable, but that doesn’t mean you can simply click whole game away. Each enemy need own strategy to deal with and bosses usually requires active usage of time rewind, temporal clones and lots of shooting, especially on hard difficulty.Of cause Blades of Time fighting system not that advanced like in Castlevania or DMC but as for me its still much more enjoyable because it wont enrage you or cheaply delay progress every time you meet harder enemies. Moreover, local magic skills may be used nearly every second without boring grind of energy\mana like in other games, thus making whole gameplay colorful and entertaining when you really enjoy slicing’n’dicing enemies differently.That’s why its quite weird to read negative reviews on game blaming its softcore battle system or non-AAA storyline. Just compare pricetags for Blades of Time and Castlevania for example (10€ and 30€ respectively) and titles itself after what ask yourself what did you expected to get for such a small price and from a game company for whom it was basically a debut RPG game.The only real cons of this game is a quite dead multiplayer (still its easy to find people to play with or against via Steam community groups) and no possibility to cooperatively play story campaign, only team-up in Outbreak Mode. Quite sad because its clear that campaign levels and story itself ready to be played in coop mode, maybe game budget was too low or developers just preferred to focus on singleplayer.Still, for a story driven game for just 10€\$ multiplayer looks more like a bonus then a mandatory feature. Thats why Im thumbing up Blade of Times and recommend this game to everybody who like hack’n’slash genre.			",542,111,29,62,40,3,78

												This game starts okay-ish, although with some less then preferable combat moves.Your attacks does not connect in any good way with enemies, even when you hit them it feels like hitting air. Besides spinning your blades through enemies, you get some magic acting very similar to each other, making them insultingly boring; fire blast is akin to ice blast, fire cube is akin to ice cube, and so on. When hitting enough enemies/air you get a prompt for doing a finish move which also seems half-a$$ed and not at all satisfying to pull off. Game felt very ""meh"" at this point, but I decided to give it a little more of my time.Pushing on, the game unfortunately disappointed more and more, and turned to complete and utter tedious garbage midway through. After a while, you have to use a ""magic sphere"" to kill enemies that are only visible and combatable inside this sphere you have to create over and over again every few metres. Enemies jump in and out of this sphere, making the already mediocre combat become super-frustrating and oh-my-god so tedious. There is also a ""rewind time""-gimmick which is just as awful as it sounds, making the combat a big mess, and not the funny and enjoyable kind. Accompanied with inane puzzles, it was more than I could stand anymore.Your game or even bundle buying money is better spent on a pack of Juicy Fruit - its taste and enjoyment will last you a longer time than will Blades of (boring) Time.

												I enjoyed Blades of Time far more then Xblades.  For hack n' slash this game is, it offers:- ok-ish story- decent, dynamic fighting system. Especially time rewind. I loved it and abused it.- amazing graphics. This game is very pretty to look at- a lot of action packed moments towards the end- some puzzle elements which make this game not braindead - multiplayer with your friendsI had only 2 major problems with BoT:- had to figure out keyboard controls for myself, since game prompted partially keyboard hot keys but for skills only pad keys.- if story is concerned, it felt really bad to have to go hacking through the human camp on ship, after so many of them were pretty kind fellas. Devs could at least make them less likable. All in all though: It was a very enjoyable experience. And if someone likes mix of slashing through enemies, puzzle elements and AMAZINGLY looking locations - this game is the way to go.			",128,23,1,19,2,0,6

												From what I've played so far, this game seems alright.It's a hack 'n slay, kinda like Devil May Cry, but the combat doesn't feel as complex.You have your regular XXX/YYY melee combos and unlock special abilities as you progress.For ranged attacks you get rifles, which are used in a third person shooter fashion (there's no lock on like other games have).There's also an interesting time rewind mechanic which basically lets you generate clones of yourself as you rewind so you can do twice or even thrice the damage to enemies.The downside about this that it's a little tricky to get used to effectively use it at first and there are parts in the game which require you to use it.What I didn't like was the voice acting and dialogue, it's rather subpar to me and the story doesn't seem as exciting as Devil May Cry's story for example but this may just be a personal thing. - The gameplay however is pretty decent.Price is alright, especially on a sale, and it even has a demo to try..

Review based off of complete playthrough of the PS3 version.Severely underrated hack-and-slash game from Russian-based Gaijin Entertainment, a stark improvement over its notoriously mediocre predecessor, X-Blades; controls are tight, combat is engaging and that time rewind mechanic is wonderfully novel and well-implemented in most scenarios. I'm also rather partial to the world, music and character design, borrowed as they might be.Voice acting and plot are entirely disposable, of course, but you can't win them all, and Blades of Time does plenty right to outweigh those minor cons; textbook definition of a hidden gem if there ever was one.

												I came to play a good hack and slash and this game truly did deliver that, truly a surprise.Some things will make you laugh if you give this game a chance, I want to be the first to say how often she breaks the 4th wall i found this hilarious cause as she figures things out she is talking out loud to you so you get it as well....Good laughs people!!The combat to me is very fun giving you basic combos to power stronger moves to maxout and blast anything standing near you, a good dash button that most hack and slash should have but hate you too much to let you have it, I'm lookin at you Devil May Cry!You can use the target button and dash to get to almost any enemy even in the air anddo some enemy hoppin and slashin, and i didnt even talk about using time powers yet!!With your time powers you can change the meaning of bullet time cause you can time jumpyourself till there is a squad of blonde girls shooting up the place, She knows how to party!The only downside is the puzzles, some are cute using time jumps but they dont give clueshere so my advice? go over your powers and use compass!Story is okay not the best but not bad but what did you expect from a game where you area blonde girl named ayumi and likes dressing in sexy tight clothes,guns,swords and time tospare?

												Not a terrible game but certainly can't recommend it to anyone, only if you are desperate for this kind of game.Pros:- Good variety of enemies- Good variety of environments- Ayumi's quality voice acting- Machine gun and time rewind combo is sweetCons:- Melee damage is super weak, it'll take much more time to kill something with melee than it takes with a gun- Melee combat is also weak, you have like two moves and you don't learn any either even though you'll learn like 6 different magic attacks. You can counter some attacks but for other attacks you can't interrupt them by normal attacks, you can launch enemy in the air but that won't do you any good, you'll just waste the time they were in the air for, you can dash away but they attack pretty rapidly and will attack again when you try to re-engage, these two methods also don't work if there are more enemies than one.- Magic is also super weak, your most powerful magic attack that takes a while to charge won't even kill the smallest enemy, probably takes 1/4 of its life- Really unresponsive controlls- Lock-on is not made to be used in combat and hardly works even for what it's intended for- Dashing is awkward in combat, you have dash attack magic but it dashes like half a meter- Story is very underwhelming- Very strange damage inconsistencies as some regular attacks by enemies take 70% of your hp while charge attacks by bosses hit for much less			",134,25,0,10,3,1,16

												A good action hack n slash with thought put behind it. No this isnt a Koei type game where you mow down thousands of brainless enemies. Those annoy the hell out of me.The story is good, if a little convoluted. But it works. Some of the enemies that need to be killed via time rewind arent explained enough though- i kept forgetting how to kill a few enemies because the game would teach me all this stuff early on then i would forget later on what to do. Also a couple of the puzzles did not make sense to me at all. I gotta say though- the environments are absolutely stunning. Lots of different colors used too. The music is also really nice as well. The time rewind feature is nice too because it lets you have multiple Ayumi killing stuff or solving puzzles. On to the bad part (not too bad though)- I did have some glitches and other oddball quirks that it took me some time to figure out how to fix them. For example, every 30 seconds or so the game would freeze for a full second, then about 3 seconds later it freeze for another second, then 30 seconds more would pass, it would repeat over and over. My solution was to run it in XP SP3 compatibility mode. (Also for some reason once the game would launch Big Picture mode would be disabled but then it would come back once i went back to Steam.) Still had light hiccups while playing but the annoying one second freezes were gone. Another thing was i would be kicking♥♥♥♥♥and all of a sudden i couldnt attack anymore, or if i tried to dash it would keep doing it over and over until i mashed a bunch of buttons. Most of the time i would have to exit the Steam and restart. All things considered its $9.99 regular price now which to me is a steal. Im sure you can find it on sale though. Even with the technical hiccups i think its worth playing definitely. 7/10			",329,20,8,2,6,1,0

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Third Person Hack and SlashThe Good+ For a budget title, the graphics look good with some decent graphical options+ Every level has a different environment and atmosphere. The levels have good pacing, providing a good mix of combat and puzzle solving with some minor exploration. + The gameplay mechanics are solid. You can rewind time, allowing you to create clones of yourself. This ability can be used in combat to defeat enemies or used to solve some of the puzzles. The puzzles themselves are not terribly difficult. + Equip different equipment providing different bonuses to stats + Controls well The Average:Story, characters, voice acting are all average. The story is decent enough but the characters are boring and its hard to care about what is going on.  The game controls well enough but combat is lackluster. The biggest negative; your attacks have no weight or feeling to them, nor is there any good feedback when you or an enemy attack. There are no combos to speak of so you just mash the same two buttons over again.  The Bad:- vsync is broken- fell through the floor a few times. Conclusion:If Devil May Cry and Bayonetta are summer blockbuster movies, than Baldes of Time is the straight to TV movie on Lifetime network. It borrows different elements from different games and puts it together but doesn’t do it well enough. It’s a fun game for what it is but don’t expect much more.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												It's a rewarding game to play: fun, good story and good gameplay.  I found some bugs with the controls in the game and most part of them I managed to fix by restarting the game.[WARNING: SPOILER ALERT]On the last boss fight, in the Dragon Temple if you fly all the controlls will bug and you will start to cast spells all the time (auto). I managed to fix this bug (a few time of search on the internet) not flying during the fight. Apparently flying somehow start the controllers bug.			",431,82,11,44,41,6,42

												It's pretty good! The story is a tad confusing to me, the combat can sometimes be a bit wonky, but if you die enough times on a section of combat it'll give you some help, so all that works out. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it though. Its a lot of fun to just go in and mess around, and laugh at all the silly physics, so if you aren't looking for a really serious game to play, this might just be what you are looking for!

												   Ok I don't want to oversell this game because it's not a triple A title and it's not meant to be but it's a blast to play.  When I think back over the past few years about titles I had fun with, this ranks right up there.  I've actually played it through twice just for the thrill of the smooth whirling combos and, what really takes it over the top, the time rewind which works both as an aid in battle and a necessity in some of the puzzles.  The game has a bit of the Lara Croft vibe.  Our heroine is after treasure and must traverse a world filled with ruins, swamps, deserts etc. but without any of those pesky irritations like inventory, crafting, side missions, story or open world.  And unlike Lara with her dozen outfits, our girl in this game sticks with the basic, practical, all purpose adventure bikini and somehow it seems so right.     So, in summary:   - love the time rewind thing   - nice graphics   - fun platforming and puzzles   - relatively uncomplicated combos and fighting even for someone like me who is not a twitch master   - did I mention the time rewind thing?Wish they'd make another one....

												105 minutes in. Great game so far. The time mechanics are incredible. Sword combat itself is alright so far; and I wish there were more of a skill tree, though I may redact that statement later on. The best part so far is easily the time mechanics; being able to just rewind time to doppelgang is something that I have never seen in a game, and if there are others, I want to know about em.

												When I first started this game, I hated every character and loved the combat. I thought the story was incredibly stupid and I was kind of surprised a game like this even had a story. It's the kind of game where every female character looks like they just came out of a 14 year old boy's wet dream. Ayumi isn't even the worst offender of this!Shockingly enough, the characters evolved such that I actually *liked* them- each main character received enough characterization to become real, likeable, *people*, rather than the walking videogame cliches they look like (ridiculously musclebound man, ridiculously over sexualized women). This astounded me; I was not expecting to have anything but contempt for the game's seemingly pathetic attempt at story. The main plot, too, evolves into something worthwhile. The biggest problem this game has is probably the fact that the story and characters are overwhelmingly generic for the first half of the game.... but it does metamorphose into something unique towards the end. Well, the characters do; the story is largely generic still but there are several key plot points that separate it from the rest.Unfortunately what did not evolve over time was the combat. As far as I know there are no combos to learn besides the very limited set you start out with. One of the combos brings you up into the air as you swing your sword about wildly, *but there are never ever any enemies that will be in the air with you*. What ends up happening is a lengthy animation of you swinging your sword in the air for 5 seconds while all the enemies wait for you to return to the ground. This happens automatically when you jump and attack- so if you need to jump over to an enemy *quickly* and attack him, unless you're very careful you might accidentally start that useless combo and it will prevent you from doing time sensitive things (there is no way to stop once started). I feel like I missed out on a mechanic or two though- you can lock onto enemies and dash at them, but 90% of the time the game bugs out and the dash is in slow motion and you never even reach the enemy. Then I read something about hanging from enemies in midair and hitting them with your sword. Huh. The most I was ever able to do was slide off them like they were covered in motor oil. You gain the ability to use fire, ice and generic projectiles very early on and then (with one exception) from there on out, all upgrades are minor and passive (for example, you might gain the ability to do more damage by using fire on someone who is frozen. No expanded gameplay, just ways to optimize damage). I started out really loving the combat, but it gets very old very fast. And it's very buggy. The entire game is buggy actually. Luckily you can usually fix everything by reloading the last checkpoint, but if your checkpoint is before a particularly challenging battle, that can be frustrating.Another major problem with this game is there are too many different mechanics. It feels like I'm playing a very long demo of hundreds of different games. Yes, the combat is boring, but constantly changing the rules of the world is not the way to fix that. At one point you gain wings and can fly, and I don't even think it is explained... then you lose your wings shortly after, also unexplained. I found out by jumping off a cliff and falling to my death. At one point you are given a gun which you are required to use; if you kill the enemies without the gun, they keep regenerating indefinitely, and this is *not explained*. It was pretty obvious I had to use the gun to kill them, but I couldn't quite figure out how, and I couldn't proceed by killing them normally. The biggest problem was the stupid jump combo- you had to freeze the enemy with the gun, then drop the gun and hit them before they thawed, except I would always activate that useless combo and never get to them in time.The time rewind itself is also problematic. For example, the ability is not explained at all. You are told that you have it, then you need to figure out how it works, which is a process that will take the rest of the game. But the game arbitrarily changes the way it works and often doesn't even let you use it! How can you learn to use it if it keeps alternating between different rule sets and often isn't even available to use? So far what I *think* happens with the standard set of rules is; any time clones of you will disappear if the main you alters enough variables in the past. So if you go back in time and get an enemy to follow the current you instead of the past you, the past you just disappears. Which is a problem because most of the time the point of time rewind is to distract enemies- but they mostly seem interested in *you*, not your past clones, which makes them all vanish, which makes the game frustrating. OK, so I understand that, I'll try to use it against this boss now that I'm a little better with it. Oh wait, you can't. Why? Because. Time rewind is not available to you for nearly *every single boss*. Then, some of the larger enemies require that you use it, but the way it works is completely different for those enemies. In one case- there's a quick time event which you need to do twice at the same time. Cool right? Not really. You do it once, you rewind time and if you don't press the button *immediately*, you lost your shot at it and you need to spend 5 more minutes weakening the enemy again. To reiterate- you can't just go back in time and wait for the opportunity to use the quick time event going forward in time, you have to hit the quick time event whilst going backwards in time.. because for some reason your clone disappears in this particular context (you can't make time rewind clones). Then, on the giant worm boss, you can make time rewind clones but the moment you do the boss just retreats, changing variables and erasing all your clones immediately. The logistics of this time rewind thing is complicated enough without all the arbitrary exceptions and changes.I can't decide if I like this game or not. On the one hand, there are unique gameplay and story elements that are definitely worth experiencing; there is nothing else like it. On the other hand, the game doesn't respect itself enough to expand upon the more interesting elements and instead chooses to try 100 different things, which all collapse into one incoherent mess of a game. I suppose I recommend this game only because the length is short enough that you can actually complete it before being fed up with its many issues, and I think it is worth at least $10, so pick it up in the next sale.

												It's crazy and quite challenging.  Even though I do recommend trying it out I have to say the game comes up short.  What I mean is that it has all the makings of a really amazing game but they just don't quite come through.  It has an awesome two-bladed brawling system with lots of options to mix up the combat, and a dashing system that allows you to move at incredible speeds, but there is no targeting system so it's easy to end up swinging or moving the wrong directions.It has a third person shooter mode that allows you to break up the monotony of combat, but there is no cover system that allows you to take full advantage of this and switching between the combat modes is extremely frustrating.  The camera can be controlled, but if you are not actively controlling it then it wanders into the worst possible positions, and odds are that you don't have a free thumb to be manipulating it.There's a decent story line that seems to be going on but it has no solid presentation to it, so we are stuck watching the conflicts between these various factions from one character's perspective and we hardly know what their motives even are.  All we really know is that Ayumi wants to get out of Dragonland (original) preferably with some treasure.  Everyone else just seems to want to kill you and that's all that seem relevant.There is an upgrade system but it's largely unsatisfying.  Your basic skills remain largely the same you mostly just build on your magic.The controls were not prioritized well and many functions just won't work at critical moments.  I almost think that the programmers thought that this should be the central idea for the final boss fight.  The game is challenging but some of the challenges feel like they went the whole wrong way. There is some intense challenges in this game, but sometimes you'll just get stumped on what do, like when you encounter the Slasher on the Skydock.  You'll end up dead and then looking at the screen wondering where you went wrong.  In all, Blades of Time feels like a pretty good game with a REALLY AWESOME game trying to get out.  It mixes combat systems in a really cool way, but doesn't polish them to make them shine.  It gives us a story, but can't be bothered for good presentation.  It gives us controls that work except when it decides not to.  It give us puzzles and challenges with very little feedback on how things should be done.  In short, it needs a lot of work.7/10.

												There were a few bugs. One bug the screen would blur until game restart (crazy bloom ?). Another bug the controls would bug out so basically any key you pressed would only cast one attack. This happened to me a couple of times, the second time on the last boss fight which actually made it impossible until it randomly unbugged (restarting had no affect).Apart from that, pretty cool game. Ayumi looks awesome and the time rewind gimmick was fun.			",43,3,0,5,5,0,0

Well, you've got a gun now. And the ""Time-Rewind""-Ability is used rather cleverly to be implemented in combat. Not so much in the mediocre puzzlesolving. Here and there you'll find something frustrating, mainly not getting what the game wants you to do. Generally though, Beating the game was fun.

Controlling jumping is extremely difficult and often makes you fall off edges.- The humans, except the main characters look all the same (clones maybe idk).- Time rewind can get a bit boring and confusing on long bosses.- Last boss was a bit confusing until I read a guide.- Voice acting.

												Overall I really enjoyed this game.The ProsThe characters are enjoyable (if you don't take your games too seriously)The area's scenery is really greatEach level has different mechanics that you use to go further explore/complete the chapterThe combat is fast paced and you get to use a lot of execution movesI found it to be a really immersive experience.It lives up to its name of being a hack n slash while also having a lot of puzzles to break up the constant comabt.The ConsThis game was incredibly short. I beat the main campaign within seven hours and the dlc in 45 minutesA couple times I encountered bugs where the AI script wouldn't run and I could not progress through a door and I had to quit and come back into the game which was a minor inconvienance but it autosaves quite frequently so I ended up losing maybe a few minutes.Twice my controls 'siezed up' I guess is what I would call it. My controls would no longer work and I had to completely alt-f4 then reload the game back up.I breezed through the bosses, I was playing on normal and now that I have hard mode unlocked I assume It will get more challenging. All in all I would definitely reccomend this game, but not at full price. There just isn't enough content to justify paying the full amount, especially for the DLC which is less than an hour long. I had a solid experience though and I'm glad I decided to finish it.			",157,23,4,52,5,1,20

												First of all, I want to say that, I haven't finished the game. Not sure, how long it will take, but I think ~60% of the game is already complete. Actually in this game you don't have to do so much. Spam that left mouse button, and use skills when you can. BUT, that would be realy easy, and kinda boring. So what about giving it a twist? Making enemies almost invicible, so you really have to use that time rewind mechanic, whit which you can make multiple clones of yourself. Sounds great, and not that hard. But what if I say, clones will last only for the moment you used time rewind before, so you have will need perfect timing for it. Now, it starts to become interesting, because I really like challanging, puzzlish games. But thinking stops here. If you realize how you can beat a certain type of enemy, or Boss, it become really boring and repetitive. Doing the same thing 3 or 4 times in a raw is basically just boring. So that's about fight system, which I actually like, but find a little undone (there was much more potential in it). About the other things, just in a few words: cool voice acting (there is japanese voice too, which I found the best :D), there are also boobs, a blonde, good looking protagonist with badass swords, that only make her better, and an interesting story, which I will surely finish, when I will get the hang of some repetitive fights. Buy it at discount, or if you are hyped about then buy it. I would give it 5/7. (if you don't know the reference, then you'll get the normal 8/10)			",81,7,0,7,3,0,5

												Blades of Time is a game that people will forget before they even know about it. However, for those that play it, you will find it has a certain charm that makes it worth seeing through to the end. It might not be a game that you rush out to buy or even rent, but if you do come across it, I bet you will find yourself smiling while playing it. Ayumi never seems to catch a break in her starring roles, but this is with the second game she’s starred in that I’ve enjoyed.			",1115,382,38,118,94,13,163

												This game is a lot of fun and is not to be taken seriously. The voice acting is atrocious, full of unintentional comedy. It is a God of War clone with a second string Lara Croft in the lead complete with English accent (or maybe Australian? either way terrible and inconsistent and hilarious.) Story is disjointed and incoherent, but still fun. It's a B-movie in a game with high production standards. Give it a try if you can find it for cheap.			",473,114,5,20,8,5,18

												This game is one of those hidden gems. It's not perfect but it's similar to playing a game like Soul Reaver, Darksiders, Castlevania or Devil May Cry. You play as Ayumi, a treasure hunter who is looking for the treasure of Dragonland. The only way to get to Dragonland is by using the Sphere owned by the secret Guild. So, Ayumi and her partner, Zero bash into the guild and use the sphere to force teleport to Dragonland. In Dragonland, you meet the Chaos Keeper Statues and the Dragon Spirit of Time and then the story begins.I must say that this game is on the way towards improving itself, I think Gaijin Entertainment (Russian developer) & Konami can probably get better. It's a failed remake of X-blades but worth trying it on sale. ($3.99)There is a major gamebreaking control bug in the last boss. It caused me to be unable to complete the game. Due to its severity, I had to change my vote to vote this game down.PROS1. Gun and Sword style fightingIt's exactly like playing the beat-them-up games.2. Quick To LearnIt's super easy to pick up if you've played other beat-them-up games.3. The TeleporterVery nice design. I like the way you made it spin before teleportation.4. Sunlight is DeadlyI like the idea. Not being able to fight in intense solar radiation.5. SkyguardsNice idea too.6. Different Guns / SwordsNice to know the inventory work differently.7. The Time WarpingAlso cool. Especially when you have to piece together a puzzle to kill a creature. I would have preferred more time powers instead of just rewind. 8. Rocket LauncherA pity that you are forced to drop it whenever you jump. This is most ridiculous.9. ExecutionsLove the way it's quickly executed, even in mid air or mid combat. There is a slight graphics twitch but it's acceptable.10. Aerial CombatI love the way you can dash to an enemy and slash him to bits.11. CreativityFloating corals? Dying Sun planet? Sky Island? Nice.CONS1. Lame NamesDragonland? Blades of Time?2. Exact CopyIt's just way too similar to the other beat them up games.a. Speed Dashb. Dash Grabc. Air Dashd. Range / Melee comboe. Double JumpAt least, improve on them.3. Bad MarketingThe team didn't advertise this game well when it was released.4. Enemies are Carbon CopiesYou will see the same enemy in the same Verne model over and over again. The only difference is the top hat. E.g. The mercenaries.5. No CitiesNo rest stops, no shops, just chop chop chop. No additional nuggets of information and lore.6. Rocket LauncherIt drops when you jump or dash. It's a very silly balance mechanic to prevent you from carrying it over to another location.7. GraphicsPretty mediocre. Honestly, there is nothing interesting to look at.8. Chaos SlasherThat's the Dahaka from Prince of Persia.9. Floating Coral GrabsThey are the same as grabbing lights in Devil May Cry or Darksiders.SUGGESTIONS1. Special Attack StylesLook at Alice (American McGee) for more details on how to design.2. More WeaponsI've played the Darksider series and I think more weapons would increase the variety.3. Flipover / Slide UnderThe Prince of Persia series allows you to flip over an opponent. I think this would be a great addition to the movements Ayumi can do. A slide under in between the legs of an enemy would be great too.4. Flying Gun CombatImagine raining rockets while flying or shooting while in the air like Devil May Cry. That would be pretty cool. 5. Co-op Tower ChallengeI think this could be in the next series. Perhaps, Blades of Time is pretty lame so you could make a new series with all the same mechanics.6. Wall Run / Wall Hop / Wall grab / Wall Combat.The usual.7. Stealth AssasinationsGood to have but not compulsory.8. SwimmingAll that water, a bikini and no swimming? What a waste.9. Complex Puzzles for Big Ticket StuffIf you have a secret chest or a super boss, finding a hidden location or a complex puzzle would be great. For story progression, simple puzzles and locks.

												Mindless fun with a hot chick, what more can you ask for? This game is a weird mix between Prince of Persia and Devil May Cry. There's plenty of hack&slash fun to be had but the campaign is repetitive, the story laughable and there's no replay value once you are done with it.

												Hot main character like Lara Croft, this game plays like a mix of the new tomb raider and god of war.  The atmosphere is great and the scenary is beautiful.  It is fun and casual and the game is fairly linear.  I love the different finishes you can do based on your current combo and I only wish I can see it a bit slower/clearer.  I like the voice acting and the skimpy clothes. Perfect game for a horny teenager.The only cons I see are buggy texture/map and some enemies behind stupidly stuck behind it.Edit: finished the game after another 7 hours with playing the outbreak + DLC.Game is really fun for action alone.The script is really bad.The story has little replay value unless you want a challenge for hard mode.The time rewind skill is really fun and allows for different combos.  My biggest problem was I never remembered how to beat the magic barrier for the longest time till I finish the game and I often had to get the monster stuck behind a ledge so I could spam attacks for 5-10 minutes to kill it.  Also, the Chaos Slasher/Reaper (whatever its called) is stupid as ♥♥♥♥.Thank you humble bundle for letting me get this for $1.00.			",506,254,14,61,33,9,59

												It's not the story and not the characters that will keep you playing 'Blades of Time'. No, the reasons that I kept coming back was the most important thing in a game thing like this - the combat. It's quick and fluid, with a lot of enemies coming towards the player. That was just the first reason, the second one is the environments. Not a single level (there's ten in total) looks like the last one, so it will never get boring to fight the Chaos and the Skyguards.If, by any chance, you're out looking for a good action game, this will do IF (!!!) you buy it when it's part of a sale or a bundle of some sort. When it's full price, I wouldn't go for it - not enough to justify the €22.99 (€27.99 if it's the 'Limited Edition', adding the Dismal Swamp DLC) price tag.			",489,140,8,67,38,6,70

												TL:DR – Third person hack and slash game similar to Darksiders, but very linear. There’s no significant backtracking, and all the puzzles are pretty easy to solve. You can beat the game in less than 10 hours. Technically, it has RPG elements but is extremely simplified.In Blades of Time you play the treasure hunter Ayumi, a scantily clad, double sword wielding fighter who can kill a whole room full of armed men but can still occasionally act like Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider reboot (whiny and afraid). It’s hard to blame her though because after trying to crash her way into a mythical treasure trove, she and her sidekick Zero (a big buff dude) get thrown into Dragonland. Now separated from Zero, you (as Ayumi) need to find your way through the monster infested Dragonland back to your own world. No, Dragonland doesn’t have any dragons for you to fight, but there are a variety of creeps itching to take a bite out of all your exposed skin.Gameplay wise, Blades of Time is a third person melee game where you can just mash the attack button and Ayumi will swing her swords like a ninja commando slashing everyone around her. However, unlike games such as Darksiders or Devil May Cry, the enemies aren’t really “stunned” by your hits and can still attack you even as they’re flinching from your strikes. Your attacks don’t interrupt them.  Fortunately you have a short range dash/dodge move that you can use to evade enemy attacks. One thing I noticed is that either the enemies all have a lot of health or your sword strikes are really weak, because killing enemies takes a lot more hits than you would expect.  Seriously, it takes like 20-30 hits to kill anything with your swords. You do have a rifle to shoot baddies with though, and that seems to be pretty strong.I said before that the game is simplified, and this applies to character development and equipment. You don’t “level up” in the game, and you don’t collect money to buy items with either. As you progress through the story, you “find” new skills or upgrades to your existing ones. They’re unmissable so don’t worry about not finding an awesome spell. All of your equipment upgrades are found using a homing compass that also guides you on which direction you should be traveling. The equipment is missable, but none of it is game changing. They all just boost 1 of your skills, and nothing else (no +armor or +damage). There are only a few magic spells for you to use (fire, ice, and a heavy blast) but they add a little variety to your gameplay. They’re not especially strong either though. Probably your greatest tool (and the reason for the game’s title) is your ability to reverse time for a short period. During the time reversal, enemies and your past self will re-enact what happened a few seconds ago. During this window you can attack the enemy with your clone for a double or even triple attack (if you reverse time in the middle of another time reversal). This is also used for puzzle solving since there are some areas that you can’t progress without hitting 2 switches at the same time (stand on switch 1 and reverse time, then stand on switch 2 while your clone is still on switch 1). Pros:+Simple gameplay and no “research” needed. Don’t worry about character building.+The game runs smoothly despite having nice graphics for a fantasy world with magic and monsters. My computer didn’t even heat up very much.Cons:-If you’re looking for an in-depth RPG like Dragon age, or a loot game like Diablo, Blades of Time isn’t the game for you. Also, the game’s “dialogue” is kind of weird. I don’t know if it’s translated from another language or just badly written at times.-There is this really annoying bug involving getting your spell casting “stuck” that requires a game restart to fix. It happens a lot in boss battles, and at first I didn’t even realize it was a bug. I thought I had a keyboard button jammed or something. It occurs when an enemy interrupts one of your magic spells.-The Outbreak multiplayer option plays like a third person MOBA but there’s nobody playing online. Don’t get this game for the multiplayer.Overall, the game is fun to spend a weekend on, especially if you just want brainless hack and slash without worrying about exploring huge areas or backtracking. You also get to fight large boss monsters and earn some easy Steam achievements. 7/10 ",655,207,34,57,43,12,103

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #25 - Blades of TimeI admit I didn't have very high hopes for this game going in.  Looking at the rather scantily clad heroine Ayumi, it struck me that this game was going to be some kind of lame Tomb Raider wannabe.  I definitely wouldn't have picked up this game on my own, but I got it as part of a Humble Bundle.  The story doesn't exactly get off on a strong start.  I start the game as Ayumi, the aforementioned scantily clad treasure hunter who gets teleported to some place called ""Dragon Land"".  Along the way Ayumi's partner is lost, so the game pretty much starts with 2 quests, one to find treasure, and one to find your partner.I say quest lightly because this isn't really a role playing game where you have a quest journal and all that.  This is more of an action-adventure game that is fantasy based.  Rather than having a quest journal, Ayumi doubles as the narrator of the story, so you'll constantly hear Ayumi make comments about her situation and surroundings.  Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I actually liked the voice acting here.  Ayumi sounded really familar and I kept trying to figure out where I had heard her before.  I finally had to look it up on IMDB, and it turns out it's the same actress (Miranda Raison) who played Cassandra in Dragon Age: Inquisition.  Even though I liked the voice acting, the story isn't really that memorable.  It felt like the equivalent of watching a movie that just goes from set-piece to set-piece, with just enough story to stitch things together loosely.What this game is really about is the combat, with some occasional puzzles mixed in.  The combat is fast paced with a lot of button mashing.  The fighting reminded me a lot of playing God of War.  Although the fights are fast paced, the enemies start out pretty simple to give you some time to warm up to combat.As you progress, you'll run into altars which are part of the story, but gameplay wise is basically a way of handing out powers over time, so you gradually become more powerful and have time to acclimate to each new set of moves.  At first, your powers are basically just different ways of attacking, but then you start getting the ability to leap around.Things got more interesting right as I was wrapping up my first hour of play, when the game gave me the ability to turn back time.  It's clear this is going to be used as a puzzle solving technique throughout the game.  The effect is pretty neat being able to rewind time to essentially create a clone of yourself who follows your original path while you can replay a section of time to do something different.While I wasn't very invested in the story, the combat was fun and engaging, and the next thing I knew I had beaten my first boss fight, and wrapped up my first hour of play.  My expectations were low going in, but I admit I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had.I definitely wouldn't recommend this game to everyone.  Combat is twitchy enough that I think casual players may become frustrated.  Also if you like your adventure games to have more of an emphasis on story, then this is probably not the game for you.  But if you are willing to set these concerns aside and embrace the combat, then your time in Blades of Time will be well spent. ",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												First I thought they want to sell this game with the main character, but I made a clear mistake. This game didn't bore me for a second, I loved every moment of the gameplay. I loved how they migrated stuff from the previous game (X-Blades) into this one without breaking the environment (previous game was anime-ish). The journals gave the story some personal feelings. My only problem with the game is the english voice acting... That is mediocre at a maximum.All in all, I recommed the game for everyone who likes hack'n'slash and epic looking spells. :)			",327,103,21,66,35,4,63

												God Of War clone with time rewinding mechanics. That's how I would explain this game to you. The rewinding mechanics allows you to work with your clone(s) to finish off enemies and bosses or solve puzzles. The puzzle aspect doesn't really fit the game, but hey, it works I guess. Think 'standing on switches' and things like that. Then there's the weapon and ability upgrading which is pretty extensive.The graphics are pretty good; I was actually surprised by how good it looked in motion. Your main character looks great (but forgettable), with the ponytails and all (woohoo, <3 ponytails !). The voice acting, however, is a bit cheesy. Mmyeah, that was to be expected I guess.But since I'm not really into the mindless action these games offer (I do enjoy them from time to time) I stopped before finishing it. No, I'm not ashamed of it. It's just not my cup of tea.In the end Blades Of Time turned out to be a very decent game, so if you're into God Of War(-like games) you might enjoy it.[Rating: 70/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												This is game is so weird I don't even know where to start. Not gonna lie, I first bought this game because of the thumbnail. Mainly, this game is a hack and slash game like many other. It has one hell of a potential because of its unusual combination of guns, swords and time manipulation. Although you need some strategy in the fights, spamming your LMB will work too. Also, the main protagonist is a chick named Ayumi with a British accent and 'mediocre' voice acting. Why not, right?Simply put, gameplay is good, graphics are.. mehh, protagonist has one hell of a body, everything else are below average..			",130,13,4,8,3,0,2

												I picked this game up in a really cheap Humblr Bundle some time back and have been really pleasantly surprised by just how good it is. The hack and slash game play is incredibly fun when slicing down groups of enemies with duel blades and elemental abilities that are gained and upgraded throughout the game, and the graphics make for a really beautiful world with many different areas. The stories nothign special in my opinion and is extremely linear but it's still very enjoying without paying too much attention to it and there are a few moments where the game doesn't properly exdplain what needs doing to get past or to defeat a certain enemy but a quick look at a walk through can get you straight back into hacking and slashing the crap out of everything again in no time! I personally wouldn't pay full price for this game myself, but if you see it on sale and enjoy fast paced hack and slash games then you should definitely give it a go!			",270,53,10,25,19,2,31

												Lovely game. Better than alot of games selling twice as expensive(it's not TOO cheap but it's definitely a good deal).Cut♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Enjoy it :) Glad I got this in my library even though I have other games I play moreI really love the time warp mechanic. It's so unique and badass and helpful! Nice scenery and graphics in general(well the NPC models are a bit lower quality than the rest of the game but no big deal really). Love hack n slash RPGs? Buy this. See this game on sale? Buy it regardless.			",109,12,1,8,17,1,7

												Blades of Time is a second-tier game, but a good one.  The feel is similar to God of War, but somewhat less epic.  Combat is mostly straightforward - heavy on mashing the LMB, light on complex combo sequences - but the gradual addition of unlockable abilities adds enough tactical options to keep the fights engaging.  The big selling point to Blades of Time is the ""Time Rewind"" mechanic that allows you to stay in place while rewinding time by a few seconds, allowing you to team up with your past self to defeat difficult enemies or solve puzzles.  It's a minor innovation that pales after a few uses, and I quickly found myself eschewing the mechanic in favour of good old button-mashing mayhem, except when faced with bosses and puzzles that demanded it.Gameplay is very linear; you're pretty-much marched down one continuous corridor from mob fight, to puzzle area, to boss arena and onwards.  That particular sin is typical of this genre, though, and when such games do give you the freedom to revisit past areas (as in Darksiders) it doesn't really add much to the gameplay, anyway.Overall, this is a solid, workmanlike offering.  There have definitely been titles I enjoyed more (the God of War series outstanding among them,) but the failure to achieve excellence shouldn't detract from the fact that this is a very playable package with no serious flaws. And yes, the protagonist is a busty young woman who wears very little clothing.  Apparently this matters.			",323,163,6,35,20,1,31

												A beautiful, exciting, and fun 3rd person, hack and slash, adventure game.You play as Ayumi, an adventurous treasure hunter, and that's pretty much all!The story is not a key point in this game at all. If you are looking for an engaging story, this is not for you.But, if you are looking for a fun and gorgeous mindless no-stop action hack and slash game, Blades of Time is your treasre, my frined.The voice acting is average, the animations are average, but the fun is off the charts. This games reminds me a lot of the old days playing Playstation 1 games. You know those games, right? The almost unknown adventure games that you can't remember their names for the life of you? With barely any story and the whole purpose of the game is to slash monsters in half? Blades of Time is exactly like that. And it does it pretty well. I enjoyed every minute playing this game. I am very glad that I came across few days ago and purchased it. I will be looking forward to playing other games by the developer, a Russian developer by the name Gainjin Entertainment. I applaud Gainjin Entertainment for making a gorgeous game like this with fun being the main and only element. Great job!Oh, and Ayumi is hot as hell! Just saying :p			",312,84,3,68,13,0,33

												I haven't been playing this for a long time (At time of review) But I can already tell you that this game is amazing The combat is smooth, enjoyable and tactical/challenging at times. The animations look epic, the graphics are good, it doesn't require an Alienware computer to run.  The main con at this game is that the story is generic , but still at the same time is unique in its own way. Its not even much as a con, because with being generic, it adds in its own twist, making it non-generic? Also, the voice acting can be bad at times, but other than that its great.Any way, I like this game, and I reccomend you all to buy it. (Main selling point: Ayumi is a lot hotter than she was in XBlades.)			",104,10,0,28,2,1,8

												Though the game was pretty good, I'm not impressed with the fighting style. You can't learn any more attack combos other than the one given to you in the game. You dont choose the skills, it's given to you as you progress. There were some annoying♥♥♥♥♥parts of the game like the damn desert ,and the voice actors were holy crap terrible, what kind of script is that, its so bad its funny. The story is very linear, no side dungeons to explore, you meet everyone regardless. The story takes around 7-14 hours to complete, maybe more if you want to explore everything and play the dismal swamp dlc. Otherwise the game is very fast paced, and requires you to solve puzzles.

												Time is your biggest ally in this game. The gameplay reminds me of Dark Siders. I really like the storyline. The controls are really smooth. Only grabbing and fighting at the same time really was a challenge. The game looks great and has great environmental sounds. Playing it feels mysterious and creates curiosity.Time manipulation really is interesting in the game and this has been really well done!The game is focussed on following the storyline, which makes it a bit short I believe. There are not many puzzles to solve either. Some parts of the game are a bit frustrating, like the chaos creature.There are a few surprises in the game as well. I don't want to spoil here, so what are you waiting for?The game features only 2 difficulty settings, normal and hard. Being a casual gamer, I was really challenged in the normal setting. Hard will be impossible for me I believe.The story really interested and surprised me. If there would be a next chapter, I would certainly buy it.The game is really worth the money, well done!

												Those too excited with time rewind probably never played Prince of Persia. Just bought it because I like to slash intensively while staring to a nice piece of sterotyped @ss and a satisfying pair of bouncing milkmaid clichê. Any similarity between Sucker Punch and Heavy Metal F.a.k.k. 2 are just mere coincidences.Yep, just bought because of that.

												Definitely not worth the full price, but still a pretty fun game. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I used a gamepad at first, but trying to aim my gun was difficult. I had to switch to using the mouse when I got to a shooting segment. I finally switched to just mouse and keyboard, and it was an improvement.There are plenty of different combos, guns, and spells to keep you busy. If you ever feel that the enemies are too tanky, then you need to use your abilities!1000x better than X-Blades.			",1092,399,32,117,103,12,138

												This game is great, it's a pity it's such underrated. Besides it's splendid visuals, that can still hold against the newest games, the time-rewinding\time cloning mechanic makes all the fights an extremely interesting mix of action and puzzle. The most common example of this is using yourself as bait, lure enemies, then port back in time, take another route, and attack them from behind while they follow your ""time clone"". Stronger enemies can be utterly destroyed the first time you land a strike because you can actually port back, and land another hit with your second clone, then go back and do the same with another and so on, this is very useful in boss fights as the boss have enormous health bars and aren't hittable most of the time.Basically, this game is great. It uses the main game mechanic very well and it's setting is at least intereting and beautifully rendered even if story and dialogues aren't great. But who the hell plays this kind of games for the plot anyway?			",375,52,5,30,16,3,29

												Finally got around to playing this game, as I got it in a bundle about a year ago and never touched it.It was suprisingly a better than average hack and slash.Think a low budget devil may cry.Possibly the worst english voice acting since house of the dead though, however it allows you to set the language to others, so I am currently playing in japanese because it IS that bad.It's not going to blow your mind, and its certainly not a AAA game but if this is on sale or in a bundle this is actaully worth your time.

That doesn't really matter though, as it's mostly just mashing button, doing combos and killing lots of enemies.It's an alright game, though it does have some glitches here and there, and some of the fights can be a bit frustrating because of those problems.

												I was positively surprised by this game. Whenever a female character is presented in a certain way, there is always the suspicion that the developers are trying to sell a game based on that presentation. While I dislike that cynical view, it isn't like it came from nothing, sadly.That said, this game has some interesting combat mechanics, and overall, I found the combat fairly enjoyable. The most notable element is a sort of time-rewind mechanic, but the way this works is it leaves a clone of you that does whatever it was that you did up to the point you started rewinding time. They use this well in puzzles, and it adds quite a bit to combat, allow for you to unleash intense burst damage. There is also a sort of magic system that works very well for this sort of action game. Basically, attacking enemies builds up a meter that allows you to use magic at certain points. It also gives you an extra-health potion (essentially) when it overflows.The story is OK, the dialog is often cringeworthy (though I felt it was more from the writing than the voice acting personally, others may feel differently, though). The locations are varied and interesting enough.Also, for some reason, there is basically a MOBA mode, not unlike that random Guilty Gear MOBA. I have no idea why, and I find it most perplexing.To recap:+ Solid Combat+ Interesting Time Mechanic+ Nice Locations= OK Plot= Random MOBA mode?- Bad Dialog			",240,45,3,47,35,1,68

												Blades of Time is the lose sequel to the 2009 released 3rd-person anime hack'n'slay X-Blades and comes up with a more realistic look and a deeper story, making an overall more mature impression to the player.In addition to swords, you also make use of rifles and magical spells to fight your way through the 20+ different enemy types in the game.Visually, BoT is a huge step forward. Beautifully designed and detailed levels with vibrant colors in varying enviroments add a lot to the mood in the game.While the game isn't exactly an AAA title, it offers a solid and challenging 9-10 hours of playtime for the main story. The Dismal Swamp DLC, in which you play from the point of view of one of the side characters, adds another hour of playtime on top of it.Additionally, the game features a fun DOTA-style coop-/versus-mode where you face hoards of enemies and have to destroy your enemy's towers.BoT offers a solid, challenging and fun experience, so make sure to give the demo a try!

												Quite possibly one of the most underestimated games of 2012. And quite possibly the most impressive and innovative time rewind mechanic in an action-adventure game.

INTERESTING HACK-N-SLASHVery fun at first, The gameplay's quite ""hack-n-slash"" for me, and pretty interesting. Kinda remind me of God of War :D. The character design is so fluctuating. from Anime-esque protagonist to Marvel-ish monster design, I'm not a type of person who loves extreme mix :p. And tell you what, i loves the way Ayumi walks xD, kinda cute and sweet lol, I don't mind if i there's any ""WALKING FOR 15 MINUTES"" archievement xD. But the movesets are way too easy, I can even play it with ""peace"" fingers on the mouse and middle finger on the keyboard. I hope there's bladethrusting-like move on the future 'cuz I need it very much. The lock-on dash is ok, but less damaging. And the aerial combat is not quite sophisticated, u cant spam aerial move like in DMC series, that's quite a problem for me.And oh yeah, The graphic.. So vibrant and beautiful, but the level design is so poor and boring :(. And  the DLC is The worst. Enemies keep coming, and i thought i had to pull some switch or something, then i realized it just a 'survive this'♥♥♥♥♥♥I dunno why people complaining about the voice acts, I changed my audio to jap's and it's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sick. Like you're playing God Eater, but on PC.More to come :D ",48,4,0,6,3,1,1

												The gameplay is much like Devil May Cry or God of War; I was pleasantly surprised by this game as not only do the visuals look nice, but there is some depth to the combat in that you obtain a variety of swords and guns that offer different benefits and you can choose from several spells as you progress, and there are lots of enemy types that require you to adjust your strategy based on what you are fighting. Not to mention Time Rewind which makes for some cool combat situations and puzzle solutions. The voice acting was decent and some of the little things like seeing the character pull out and look at a compass in lieu of the usual minimap system was actually pretty cool.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great litte game with a decent enough story to it. For as little as I have played it, I think it will be ok to the end. The graphics are fantastic, good job done on them. I think it would be worth the time more than the cost. If there is any upgrades to this game, such as, DLC, it shouldn't cost you, however, that's only my opinion. If there's a newer version, cost wouldn't be a problem. Try it, you just might like it. The Options layout is set up really good. Everything you need to know is there and, there are hints on playing throughout the game so, the need for any manual isn't necessary. More games need their Options set up like this one has.

												One of the most underrated games of 2012.While it lacks in terms of storytelling, it features some nice unique hack 'n slay elements.Sometimes monotenous, but satisfying, sometimes brain-steaming, because a bossfight needs the player to find the enemies weakspot while making a use of this game's ""time-shift"" mechanics, giving every new encounter some puzzle-solving elements.You can reverse the time until a certain extend, while your original body remains untouched by the effect, letting you create clones, to either solve simple puzzles, like a 2-way pressure plate switch or to distract enemies to attack 'em from behind. The game, however, puts simple pressure plates all over the place, which gets boring quick.With better narrative and more variety in terms of puzzles, Blades of Time could have been a real gem and an instant recommendation to anyone.It's definitely no Devil May Cry or God of War, but for fans of the hack 'n slay genre, it's a decent addition to their library.

												This game isn't necessarily bad, but it sure as hell isn't worth $25 imo. The voice acting was mediocre. The action was fast-paced and had an interesting idea behind it, but it ended up getting very boring a couple hours in. A normal fight would just be spamming (on a gamepad) X with the occasional dodge to avoid getting hit and very rarely using one of the abilities that you have to spam X to be able to use. The story seemed to be okay from what I have completed so far. I'm happy I got it in a bundle from Bundlestars.com (it's going on until December 18, 2013) since I would have been very disappointed to pay $25 for it.			",250,55,2,41,14,3,35

												AhhhahhahahahahahhahahahahahNo.Just barely over an hour in and I can't do it.  Gameplay's meh, but functional, aside from the gun aiming, but what made me instantly not want to play it any more was the god awful writing.  I mean seriously, even bland triple A protagonists seem to be a hell of a lot more appealing than the poorly written and overly talkative character that is just one of the worst attempts at characterization i've ever seen.  I literally muted the voice just to make it somewhat bareable, but I had the subtitles on and it didn't help.  So why didn't I just turn them off and enjoy the game?As i've said the gameplay is really not worth slogging through this. Even the time mechanic doesn't make me want to play this more.  I'm not too irate since I got it in a cheap bundle with 7 other games for like 2-3 bucks, so i don't feel regret, aside from having wasted 87 minutes of my life. Seriously though, the new Lara Croft seemed more entertaining than whatever the hell is game is trying to be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though it has flaws, Blades of Time is no doubt potentially a fun game.  I say ""potentially"" because if it weren't for the massive framerate drop during the entire game, the repetiive enemies, the uninteresting characters, predictable gameplay, terrible platforming, and the puzzles, I would say this would be a buy instead of a rent.  Despite being ""Limited Edition"" version, all that is ""limited"" is an extra level which you play as a different character...which should've been an option from the start.  (Why is it that ""Limited Editions"" are the ""complete package"" again?)  The idea of having your avatar go back in time to use your past selves to fight alongside your present version is a great gameplay mechanic, especially when used in the right way such as fighting enemies.  The main problem is, like any other hack-and-slash game, this mechanic is often pushed to the side or being thought of as a secondary option for combat rather than being the focus.  The enemies are repetitive, making the gameplay predictable as you will be forced into implementing the same strategy to defeat the same enemy over and over again, which doesn't add much to the ""time"" mechanic when you think about it.  The game tries to give you a break from combat to do some puzzles, but they are not very exciting and are WAY too easy to complete (I hate puzzles anyway).  The only challenging level was the desert level where if you touch the hot sand, you will die, forcing you to use the shade as a literal cover.  No other game I know of has a creative level like that!  Also, the characters are so bland, and the main charcter Ayumi NEVER SHUTS UP!  Always with the complaining!  Other M syndrome, anyone?  Finally, the controls are VERY clunky.  The jumping mechanic is especially annoying and tedious because when you jump, you either automatically ""bounce"" or slide before you come to a complete halt, and it makes the platforming sections all the more frustrating.  This is something MANY modern platforming games whether 2D or 3D shouldn't be doing.  In the end, Blades of Time has the potential to be something more, but in the meantime, I suggest renting this game instead of buying it.			",26,1,0,5,3,0,5

												As many other reviews have already stated, this is a 'beat-em-up' in the vein of Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Unfortunately, it cannot live up to that legacy. The story is not memorable (borderline terrible), the amount of times you're given the same information over and over becomes ridiculous, and odd pacing make it hard to appreciate any positive aspect of the game.Graphically, it's decent enough to look at but not something to write home to Mom about. The controls are serviceable, but oftentimes I found myself targeting an enemy and falling to my death, or attempting to hit the button prompt and instead getting beaten to death by the enemy that shouldn't have been able to hit me in the first place.And man, they really need to work on their character work. Supporting characters would show up with no introduction, yet we as the audience are supposed to understand who they are. None of the characters were intriguing, and the interaction and introduction of the characters was extremely sloppy.If you can get past all of that, then you have a serviceable beat-em-up. However, if you have any others sitting in your backlog, think twice before picking this one up.Final verdict: if you enjoy games where every single character is annoying and terribly written, bad guys that spout dialogue that is so muddled in post-processing that you need subtitles to just understand the (threadbare) storyline, and semi-janky controls then this might be up your alley!

												I cannot fathom words to correctly describe my disdain for this game. The character will not - nay, cannot shut up. The animations are all trite. The story is barely there - she's some sort of treasure hunter hunting for dragon treasure? Motivation is not even there; theres treasure, I must hunt it. The combat is thus: mash attack. If the enemy gets the upper hand get ready to hurt with no recourse but to dash away and hope you land the first hit next time. Special moves go where the camera is facing not where the character is facing. Which brings up the camera, its horrible.Games like these make me glad Sarkeesian is not a gamer, she'd have seen this and used it as ammo. How so, you may ask? Among other things: her chest billows in the wind. Don't buy this thing.			",167,19,4,20,9,0,9

												I haven't had this much fun in years. For a hack n slash game, it performs really well. The scenic environments are built really nice and have an epic atmosphere, something to stop and look around at. The music fits very well with the game and is pleasant to listen to. Sounds effects are great too.The most exciting part of the game is building up your rage bar (special attack) when fighting menacing looking bosses, or even slashing up hundreds of enemies in the ""outbreak"" mode. Really chuffed at how good this game is considering it was available in a bundle alongside several other games for cheap. If i knew of this game beforehand, it's something i'd consider paying full retail price for. I'm really enjoying it so far.The game is actually quite challenging, and you will die several times when encountering a boss (for example) as it isn't always obvious how to defeat them at first. This is something that i love from any videogame, this is no walk-in-the-park, but also alot of fun.Voice acting isn't amazing, but it is rather well done, a few lines can sound goofy or out of context at some times.If i had to give it a rating, it would be 8/10.

You end up depressed as you die upon die upon die with the boss taking no apparent damage at all. Then when you figure it out, it is nothing more than a grind. Rinse and repeat.

												The game itself with all the nice graphics and beautiful scenery along with hot looking fighter is a great game to play.  The only down side is there are too many complex movements that have to be done on a keyboard to use her special abilities which makes it very difficult to keep up with the some of the bosses you have to figtht to get to next section of the game.  The walkthroughs help alot but its the keyboard combinations that are too hard to do for me at least on PC.  I gave up on the first main boss that looks like a giant robotic monster.  It was fun while it lasted and I have  not regrets buying it on sale.			",15,2,6,0,1,0,3

												The character design is painfully stupid and the voice acting is horrible. The protagonist's running animation was so silly it made me chortle. Sure, there might be a fairly decent game in there somewhere, and I generally like hack and slash / RPG games, but looking at the protagonist's outfit makes me feel like I've stumbled upon some sexual kink I can't relate to. I've ignored lots of chainmail bikinis when there's been a chance of enjoying good playability and script writing, but this time I just gave up.			",291,199,6,52,37,5,59

												The gameplay is boring, they talk too much and you 100% don't feel like you're accomplishing anything when you complete an objective. The fights are so repetitive (basically, while you're dealing with the close-ranged guys, there are TONS of snipers shooting at you. Seriously, that's how the fights go the whole time). I bought this game after watching a gameplay video on YouTube, thinking this game was gonna be a bomb since it costs freaking 30 bucks and I was utterly disappointed. Might wanna buy it if it's like 50% off but otherwise don't waste your money on it.			",89,5,1,10,2,0,2

We can say it's a Prince of Persia without all the stunts and puzzles. The story is not bad, and the gameplay is good overrall, there's find-a-pattern-to-kill bosses, normal weakling insolent mooks and flying Uka Uka's from Crash Bandicoot that shoot purple missiles at you. Didn't really pay attention to voiceacting and music though.In the end, if you want to masturbate at high-res textured polygons, you HAVE to get this.			",474,102,13,56,34,4,62

												'Blades of Time' packs a sexy heroine with lots of action and puzzles. The controls are a little weird at first but once you customize and get used to them there's a lot of exploring, fighting and gun play around the corner, the story unfolds pleasantly and the different landscapes are very beautiful to watch. Also, the innovative time travel feature which basically allows you to replay at the same moment that your double(s) are doing the original action(s) to kill difficult hordes of enemies or solve more complex puzzle that require you to be in multiple places at the same time. Sounds confusing? Time travel always is, but despite it's complications it's definetly recommended for casual adventure gaming!Multiplayer: It's a real shame you can't play with at least 4 players at the same time because the defense/attack principle with a base works really well.Dismal Swamp DLC: Very short and not very challenging but still fun as it shifts the game's focus from puzzles and special abilities to simple hack and slash and shooting survival mode.PS: The game is easy to find on certain bundles or on sale so don't pay more than 10 bucks! Manage your expectations! It's fun but it's no masterpiece!			",218,26,0,17,5,0,12

												First of all, I have to say third person hack and slash games is one of my favorite genre of games.  I know a friend who won't get games that are lower than certain ratings, games that are not really AAA titles, I could understand where he is coming from, I know there are many option out there, why waste time and money on something that has mixed reviews.  But I'm glad I played this and didn't miss out on it even this game has somewhat mixed reviews. This seems to be one of those games that have many little flaws.  The story writing seems like a mess, and the ending almost feel like this is one of those movie or tv series that they just run out of budget at the end.  The voice acting(English one at least) is horrible I think, and the soundtrack is uninspiring. Aside with all those little flaws,  I truly think the gameplay is awesome.  I like the control of it very much(but not when the protagonist is using a gun).  I like how the protaganist dash, or slash, it all feel very smooth, and very powerful.  And I got through the game because I have so much fun hacking and slashing away.  The puzzle in this type of game is easy, and I think this is how it should be for this genre of game,  I know there are some hack and slash game that has difficult and sometimes illogical puzzles....Seriously, if I want to play hack and slash game, I want it to be as brainless as possible, or else I would play some crazy puzzling point and click adventure game or something. If this game didn't have the flaws that I mentioned, it wouldn't have been one of the most underated game I think.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed playing it, because it was fun. If you like this type of hack and slash game, I think you would have fun too. ",247,124,17,38,22,5,37

												Game is aweful, controls are confusing, hit boxes are unreliable, objective is not clear, how to defeat mini bosses/bosses is unclear and they have invulnerability and the minibosses/bosses can grapple you from 15 feet away for no good reason, Combat isnt fun and very floaty, forces player to do everything in one way, and the worst part is after every jump and every dash your character just stands there and gets attacked and you cant evade attacks unless you do one of these and then you can dodge the next one. Overall for price it could be better, for the comany it could be a lot better and im not complaining, but do you really need a female character to fight in skimpy leather and way oversized highheels i mean really sexualized much?

												This game does not have a deep story or any interesting charactor, but the combat is really awsome. However one thing I really hate about this game is the puzzle. Don't get me wrong, I love puzzles in video games. However this game's puzzle just makes 0 sence! Even after I beat the game, I have no idea how did I pass those puzzles. All I did was just running around and randomly using time rewind. After finished this game, I simply have absolutely no desire to replay it because the butt hurt puzzles. Over all, 7/10. If you really have nothing better to do and want to kill some free time, this game is for you. But don't buy it unless it's on discount, it's not worth 25 bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only complaint I really had was Sky Island glitched out my reload, compass, and elemental use. Seems a quick restart fixed this issue, however.

Time for a review!Since I'm a giant Hack'n'Slash fan, I enjoy this game every much. The graphics are great and the levels are beautiful. Loading times are fast and it only takes a second to reset after you die. The controls are great and the powers you unlock through out the game are really unique. However, this game is kind of buggy, so you'll come across a few glitches from time to time, but other then that, everything is ok. Also, Ayumi's diolouge can get very annoying and she tends to talk to her self a lot, but I don't blame the voice actor, since she was given something to read. I have to say, the game is very well put together. I'm still making my way towards the end of the game and I can't wait to play the DLC.Well done! - 8/10 ",219,25,12,8,12,1,16

												when played with a gamepad (I used with x360ce), it is a really fun game. it has a linear plot and some boss battles are really hard, but when you find the weakness is in you and realize you need a new strategy instead of smashing buttons, it then makes a funny play.it tastes good, yet the twist at the end makes it hard to make a sequel.oh! by the way, the outbreak mode is where you can play with a friend with the DOTA style in 3D mode. its better to pour your anger in than playing all game again :)			",323,70,0,50,7,1,18

												Man... If only I was able to describe my feelings about this game more precisely I would. I don't exactly have a black and white opinion about this game, although I do feel that I don't exactly recommend this game. Knowing that this game WAS a budget title it did deliver its value... Sort of. The game is good over-all the combat is pretty fast-paced, the level design was great. Locations deliver that very ""fantastical"" sort of idea that, that kind of world would only exist in a dream. I haven't gotten that far into the game yet, considering the amound of time I've played before writing this review (about less than an hour). I feel though that I've gotten enough things to cringe about in Blades of Time.One, the animations. Man... I don't exactly understand the whole dynamic as to why this is a problem in the first place but, considering I know just a tad bit about animation, is that every movement takes a TON of time. Walk cycles are the worst when trying to animate by hand, without a mocap device. Anyways, I noticed one big peeve of mine for BoT: Ayumi's running  cycle. If you don't pay much attention to it, it looks decent enough to make a big deal out of it. But, what I notice is that with every step, her head just turns with her body. 95% of the time she's looking left and right and rarely to the front. I see myself already in the future when I play the game and just have those long running sequences I'll just get constantly bothered by the fact that she can't look at one damn direction when she's running. I thought it sort of made sense at first since, she was in a completely new world and she wanted to just take as much of its beauty in as possible. But nope, just a damn animation problem. I don't think it would have taken much to lock her head relatively in the same position as she's moving: forward. It shouldn't take much precision either, as long as it's in approximately the same location the whole time, it should be flawless. Another problem that I have with her running is her arms and legs. She flails her legs outward while keeping her knees in so she sort of pushes her body in a diagonal direction (which may explain why she keeps turning her damn head, although probably not). It's hard to describe for me through text but just look up gameplay and I'm sure you""d understand. Also her arms are kept way too close to her body for her to even look like she's running comfortably. Her arms, instead of moving forward and back while she runs, they more rotate around her body in a sort of elbow-to-chest-then-to-shoulder-blade movement. Ridiculous I know, but I'm not known for being good at describing things.Second, the narrative that Ayumi does. THE CONSTANT NARRATIVE. I swear after every minor part, she's going to speak her mind about either the world or what she thinks about the new enemies she'll encounter. It becomes a bit of an annoyance. Again, I'm still not that far into the game, maybe that'll change but, we'll see. Also the way the game gives you hints about how to progress the level is... I don't know. Compared to other games, the way the hint is either presented or shown, it sort-of makes me feel idiotic. Like, I could have figured that out all by myself? Yet, that's all based on opinion and I don't want to force you to believe me on that point. But let's look at the wider aspect, the voice acting itself. It's pretty good, to say the least. The only problem I'd have is with Ayumi's narration, sometimes it's very noticeable that she's reading off of a script rather than being immersive into the BoT world. I'll update my opinion once I've finished the game.Last, the shooting mechanics. It's too locked for me. Like, I'm moving on an axes instead of fluid mouse motion. Also the way Ayumi moves when in ""Gun Mode"" is way too smooth. She's basically sliding on the ground rather than walking when she's aiming. I feel like there'd need to be some sort of bobbing motion while you move to at least make the game feel just a tad bit more, normal? I'd say? The movement is too mechanic rather than fluid. But I could also incorporate this with my first point but I'm too lazy to care (heheh..)Overall I'd say this game is playable if you don't pay attention to much of the details in which I've pointed out thus far. It's got a pretty promising story line, fast-paced combat, awesome level, character, and monster design (no it's not because the main character looks attractive, although in my opinion it's sort of wierd to say she is, since... I don't know I guess you'll have to see it for yourself and establish your own decision), pretty good sountrack too! Well yeah, I'd say a 7 out of 10. I got the game off of a bundlestars bundle so if you want to pick the game up? I'd say you'd get your money's worth if you got it through that, and hey, you'll get 7 extra games that you most likely will not play along with it. But for $4.01? I'd say it's worth a shot.

												Recommending for the single player visuals. Grab it while it's on sale, otherwise don't bother. It's a beautiful hack-and-slash game with a decent concept, crappy voice acting, and interesting creatures. It's fun to mess around with, and honestly the time I've invested in it was pretty worth it. If you're thinking of getting it for multiplayer, don't bother. It's one of the crappiest, out of sync things you'll ever touch. Maybe. It's not worth a cent in multiplayer.Anywho, if you like to point and click as well as attempt to memorize what every little keyboard key does, then go for it.			",46,7,0,5,2,0,1

												Blades of Time is a joy of a game that relies heavily on its time-adjust ability.  Unfortunately, it comes to rely on this a bit too much. While there are plenty of puzzles to solve, great graphics and entertaining gameplay, the story (complete with full voice acting!) falls short about mid-way through the game.  Several encounters begin to feel forced and the gimmic of the game begins to really show.Don't get me wrong, I really, really liked this game.  Until about 70% complete.  It's definitely worth playing through the first time and the gameplay is fun while the art pulls you in.  It feels like the love child of Kingdom Hearts and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, but without the tremendous story to fall back on.  This game is a terrific find when on sale, but it just doesn't have enough hutzpah to keep me completely in love and justify a full price purchase.			",267,50,0,62,35,1,40

												While this game is short and the story is feels like it was written by a 14 year old it manages to be fairly enjoyable throughout. I'm honestly not very interested in the hack-and-slash-adventure genre but the time between fights or puzzles is minimal and managed well. It took me 6.3 hours to beat the story on Normal. I consider that to be subpar. There were a lot of oppertunities to squeeze another chapter here or there and make some of the chapters longer.The treasure hunting aspect of the game is good for the pacing and keeps you from being bored of the near constant stream of enemy groups. The problem with the treasure is that none of the items made a dramatic impact on the game. The enemy groups are tedious at times. They, predictably, send 3+ weak enemies with 1 or two enemies of medium strength. Occasionaly you'll fight a tougher enemy, but the game treats many of them as bosses and there's little penalty to death.I would recommend this game only if it's running cheap or you desperately need another game of this genre. It's not bad, but it is very average.			",482,81,14,61,44,7,89

												Blades of Time is a better game than X-Blades, but not by much. The game knows it has a good idea because it abuses the time feature trick a bit too much, and like a kid wanting attention, you’ll just get fed up with it being in your face all the time. I did have fun with the game – there’s something about it that made me enjoy just hacking down some fools with my clones in fancy fashion, even if the rest of the combat is a little flat and basic. In the end though, all the problems pull it down and make Blades of Time a game that can be fun to play at times, but nothing more. If you don’t mind that, you might be one of the people that Ayumi is just looking for, because I can’t see her finding many fans with her latest treasure hunt.			",1095,342,75,170,83,11,164

												A Very nice hack and slash game that combines the destructive forces of devil may cry and the time ability of prince of persia.The graphics are actually really good and the gameplay fun and easy and the game keeps giving you power-ups to not make the game boring but it also doesn't make you overpowered. Instead you will encounter new more powerful enemies!So you have this great gameplay and good graphics, what's bad? To be honest nothing unless you are really negative against japanese names on blonde girls running around showing off alot of skin. The protagonist is called ayumi and in the beginning she is running around in almost nothing for clothes! But unlike other games were you progress as a girl you gain more armor by having less armor this game actually gives you new outfits that covers ayumis whole body and to be honest they look REALLY good. So if you can look past her name and her first outfit  this is a great hack and slash game! The environment is rich aswell and really breathtaking aswell.Now for the last thing. Is it WORTH the money?The answer is both yes and no. It's good so I would recommend you buying it but it's not so good that I'm going to force you to buy it now this instant. Intead I suggest that you wait for it to show up on a steam sale or a partner webpage that have some sweet offers daily.points: 8/10 (Could be alot worse but it shows what type of people the developers are and some people just doesn't like it therefore the 8.)

												Must-have game for the Action RPG lover!  The fighting mechanics are some of the best I've seen since Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.  It VERY smoothly integrates First Person shooting with real-time, in-your-face, combat.  It's quite addicting, actually.  The coolest part of the game, though, is the ""Time Rewind"" feature.  They integrate this with the combat so flawlessly that it adds SO much possibility to the way you can go about killing monsters!  Basically, you rewind time from the actions you just performed, and you create clones that re-enact what you just did...meanwhile, your real self can do different actions - and then you can rewind time again and have multiple clones doing multiple actions, and it's just a big cycle!  Sometimes, it's necessary to use this feature to kill monsters, too, which is really neat.  It forces you to learn how to use the tool, and I'm glad it did!    The puzzles are also brainbusters - I had to look up tips and hints for a couple of them!			",149,9,3,16,13,3,22

												This game's fast paced combat was a very welcome change. There are a lot of different attacks and moves so playing the demo is not intuitive. In the full game the skills are introduced gradually so by the end you are fluidly carving your way through hoards of enemies with swords, guns, magic and time travel as if it was the most natural thing in the world. You unlock weapons and charms throughout story and outbreak modes to modify these skills. The levels and enemies are well designed but it is the combat which is the jewel in the crown. This is probably best game I played in the past 6 months or so. On the down side there is a very nasty bug in the flying sections that can screw up your controls and be extremely frustrating. I can't finish this review without mentioning Ayumi's breasts. I can only assume the designer had heard a description of breasts but never actually seen any. If this is the case then the erratically jiggling party hats she has on her chest are a creditable effort.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												It’s a nice hack & slash game. Really beautiful and colourful looking levels. Even when the graphics are not up to date, they are still very nice looking. At times I just stood there and looked around…… and the woman :p . Controls are really smooth and the combat is fast. M&K work perfectly and it displays the keyboard buttons and it doesn’t really feel like a console port.  The story is OK but nothing special. I got the limited edition which includes; wallpapers, a soundtrack (which is OK to listen to but not great) and a DLC were you play a different female character. Only she doesn’t have the same abilities as the main protagonist. It is OK to play. Mainly slashing and shooting lots of swamp monsters.The bad things in this game are the voice acting.It does have some minor control problems, which appear only at certain places in a level (which could be a bug) but very rare though.  It’s a fun game to play. It made it in to my favourite list  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know that I can really recommend this game to any of my friends. The graphics are pretty good in some areas, but textures are painful in others. The Story is near incomprehensible. The voice acting, rather the script writing, is laughable. The gameplay consists largely of walking towards an enemy and clicking the mouse until its dead. Occassionally you might throw a spell in there or jump or shoot a gun, but pretty much just clicking will take care of 90% of your problems. There were some decent puzzles....about 2 of them. The time rewind feature was woefully underutilized. Inventory doesnt really matter as no matter what you have equipped, just keep clicking the mouse and you will eventually get there. The boss fights did have a bit of strategy to them, I'll give it that, but anytime you can time rewind, simply pull out the machine gun and time rewind 5 clones to all shoot at the same time and anything will die in about 10 seconds. Its not a bad game at all, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed parts of it, but can I reccommend you spend your money on it? No.This is an example of a game that got the bigger parts right but is let down by the details.5/10			",174,25,4,30,16,2,38

												I can't generally recommend this game, but you might like it if you are real hack'n'slash action fan. It's an average in everything, doesn't shine anywhere and doesn't surprise you at any point. Story is linear and very expectable from the beginning. Combat is fun, however boss fights could have been better. Every one of them has only one or two tricks in their pocket, and so they quickly become just an enemy with a lot of health where you do a certain chain of things over and over (which gets boring).I've also experienced few bugs and crashes. With 7-8 hours to finish the game, I don't think this title will stay in my memory for a long time.			",131,26,8,29,14,6,25

I don't want to play long enough to be able to give that level of a confident review. Don't buy this game. If you can get it just to laugh at it for a couple of minutes, sure why not.

I only played the game for 24 minutes, but that 24 minutes was so boring and depressing, that I don't know if I'll pick this up again.  It looks like every other third person game made with UE 3, and there's almost nothing to its combat.The writing and voice acting are awful. I turned the speech volume all the way down, and that made the game slightly more bearable, not enough to keep me playing though.			",160,39,1,18,13,1,18

												It's okay... not worth full price.The main character is gorgeous.It's not a game that'd stick with me I guess, but it's not bad either... it's just... eh.I do recommend it because I only 'don't recommend' games I really dislike and it hasn't been horrible... BUT I'd do some research or wait for a sale... I'm pretty sure porn would be cheaper.			",668,299,12,85,59,6,111

												when played with a gamepad (I used with x360ce), it is a really fun game. it has a linear plot and some boss battles are really hard, but when you find the weakness is in you and realize you need a new strategy instead of smashing buttons, it then makes a funny play.it tastes good, yet the twist at the end makes it hard to make a sequel.oh! by the way, the outbreak mode is where you can play with a friend with the DOTA style in 3D mode. its better to pour your anger in than playing all game again :)			",323,70,0,50,7,1,18

												Given the Very Positive rating that this game has, I was hoping for something much better. It's just a third-rate Western third person action game. I only played the game for 24 minutes, but that 24 minutes was so boring and depressing, that I don't know if I'll pick this up again.  It looks like every other third person game made with UE 3, and there's almost nothing to its combat.The writing and voice acting are awful. I turned the speech volume all the way down, and that made the game slightly more bearable, not enough to keep me playing though.			",160,39,1,18,13,1,18

												This game performs terribly, plays worse, and has no soul. I would rather gouge my eyes out than spend more than twenty minutes attempting to play this mess of a game. The first few minutes I spent on this game had me laughing histerically to how bad it controlled, how obscene the default mouse sensitivity was, and the insane motion blur that made seeing anything impossible when combined with said obscene mouse sensitivity.Honestly, I can't give this game a score. I don't want to play long enough to be able to give that level of a confident review. Don't buy this game. If you can get it just to laugh at it for a couple of minutes, sure why not.

												Blades of Time is a fun, third-person, hack 'n slash + shooter game which has you controlling a female protagonist throughout your journeys. You will gain abilities, costumes, weapons, equipment and somewhat of an attachment to some of the unique strengths of the game, which include the Time Rewind mechanic. The story is really meh, it has many cliche or simply boring moments, and overall it's not a very strong, memorable one. However it's not the worst story ever. The combat is fairly well done, though the execute animations can sometimes feel a bit long and enemies rarely ever interrupt you when you're executing enemies, leaving you feeling invulnerable during an execute. Shooting is really bad, honestly. But it's third person shooting so yeah...Overall this game was pretty good and if you see it on sale, get it and give it a playthrough.If you like God of War or any third person hack and slash games, this may be for you.7/10			",391,84,26,36,18,4,41

How am I supposed to aim when every time I move the mouse slightly towards the direction of what is trying too kill me the whole screen goes blurry!? Why did I bother buying this game!? What possessed me to buy this... It sounded like an interesting game but it's not. It's boring, the character sucks, the control system is bad, the motion blur OMG!

												This is one of those games that look good in the trailers and just looks like a good hack n' slash. However.This game has some of the worst controls ever! The mouse acceleration is beyond belief and that makes the camera hard to control (I've tried editing it in the options menu but did nothing.)Also. The voice acting is terrible... The absolute worst.Good things about the game:Music: The music is brillaint, the sound effect are pretty decent but, nothing special. Graphics: The models and skybox are pretty good...Level designs: The levels / stages / worlds / whatever look pretty good. Well designed.Bad things about the game:Graphics: The textures on the ground, gates, items, plants, water, lava etc. is terrible. Even with everything on high.Controls: The controls feel sluggish, it sometimes doesn't react when you press the keys on your keyboard.Camera: The mouse acceleration is so bad that it's hard to control the camera. (Looking around, shooting things and hitting things in general) (Can't seem to fix)Enemies + Boss battles: Enemies can be hard to hit due to the camera and some of them are pretty fast so you will take some hits from those enemies.Story: There's not really a story... You want to find a treasure and... that's it.Voice acting: FREAKIN' AWFUL!Crashes: The game crashes sometimes when pressing the inventory key. Do not buy this game. I only had a tiny bit of fun due to the sound she makes when she dies. So, I jumped off a cliff like 10 times just so I could hear the pathetic voice acting scream. You should only get this game if it's under $1.			",239,58,36,37,27,4,23

												Overall I enjoyed this game. The combat was fun and the environments were well done. The major problem with this game is that as you get closer to the end, the combat system and spells becomes glitched. Restarting the game fixes this for a minute or two, but it inevitably reoccurs. I mannaged to fight my way to the last boss despite these glitches, but now there is no way for me to beat the boss. The spells activate by themselves and cause me to stand still until it eventually casts. So during the boss fight I become a sitting duck. Not sure if this glitch happens with everyone, or just a few.Because this glitch left me unable to finish the game, as well as breaking the smoothness of combat throughout the 2nd half of the game, I can not recommend this. It is a game breaking bug.Hope this helps others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hello,I played for an hour, finished few levels and unfortunately this game isn't just my cup of tea. I uninstalled it and doubt will come back to try it ever again. I also had a feeling this game do not have much more to offer above what I have already seen. By the way it really reminds me of Devil May Cry 4, which I think is a great game, in terms of fast paced enjoyable combat, but Devil May Cry is much more mature.Here is what i liked and dislike about my short experience with Blades of timePros:+ Okay graphics+ Swell animations+ Swift, enjoyable and powerful combat system. It is just whoah! + Hot protagonist (although fighting in high heels must be really difficult)+ Many fun ways to kill enemies (ex. shooting and catching enemies in air)+ Time rewind+ Very good optimization, no lags, bug etc. Feels like 100% finished product.Cons:- Ok, my biggest complaint with this game is, it just feels so immature! The protagonist is like a little girl who won't shut up and keep talking to herself like she was insane or incredibly and immensely stupid. I just could not stand it!- Enemies so boring- First boss fight was a chore, not fun at all - Controls are really bad - especially dash on shift... I tried to change it in the option but there is no such a possibility. May I ask why?- game is on trails on the time and this compass showing you were is a secret is a meh- Book-like inventory I do not likeI cant comment on the story as I barely started the game so I skip this one, but the start of the story did not attract my attention. My overall rating from what I saw is 4-5/10 - I cannot recommend this game but I do understand it can be really good for some who do not mind the things I could not stand about this game			",67,31,1,27,4,0,28

												Was quite enjoying this game until it came to platforming and moving through areas quickly or whatever. You aren't very good developers so don't overface yourself. I wanted a range of cool weapons and attacks and spells and instead you wasted all your time and effort making a massively overambitious dynamic world which slows down and kills the experience. As soon as I got to the desert I was done. ♥♥♥♥ dashing to shade after a fight when you have no health and dying repeatedly... BOOOORING! also the rewind time is too much effort.

Posted: December 14, 2014
												At present, these are only my first impressions, but I have to say that from what I've seen so far, this game is really quite enjoyable. I'd describe it as a cross between Bayonetta and Tomb Raider - it's a hack-n-slash by nature but it also has a third-person shooter element, and you can switch between these modes on the fly, which I find to be a really interesting addition - it allows for a unique take on both genre's formulas, and contrary to what you might think, in the midst of a fight flicking between the modes feels rather natural - it almost feels as if the game encourages you to use both in tandem to achieve your goal.In hack and slashes of this game's type, combos tend to be both essential and, for a gamer like me, rather hard to pull off. Blades of Time remedies this a little - whereas in a game like Bayonetta the combos would be a ridiculous string of button presses, Blades of Time has relatively simple button combos, press one button to ready, press another to attack. In that sense I found myself enjoyng the game a lot more, because I didn't really need to worry about all the ridiculous combos I'd have to pull off - While a more hardcore hack-n'-slash fan might not find this appealing, I personally think it's a nice touch, making the game easy to jump in and out of without needing pinpoint-precise button presses.I have but two criticisms of this game: First, the english voice acting is pretty bad, though this is remedied by simply switching the voice language to Japanese, and second, the story makes absolutely no sense - the game goes straight from the title screen into the opening cutscene without a shred of explanation as to what is going on. However, when you're in the thick of it, hacking and slashing and shooting and magicking enemies like there's no tomorrow, you honestly forget about these errors, because you're just having too much fun to really care.Overall, despite its shortcomings, Blades of Time is a lot of fun, and an interesting fusion of the hack & slash and third-person shooter genres, and I'd reccommend this game if you were a fan of either genre. An underrated gem, this game has enough action to keep you entertained for a long time.			",999,203,38,77,56,8,86

												Great game. Can easily stand up to genre kings like Devil May Cry. Fast fighting fun in a very pure, uncompromised and likeable way. A solid selection and variety of moves, an interesting time-rewind feature to overwhelm enemies with multiple copies of oneself and solve basic button-press puzzles, nicely designed enemies, varied, beautifully designed and memoreable levels, a great soundtrack, a not necessarily revolutionary but nevertheless somewhat interesting story (it needs time to build up, but when it does it takes pretty epic shapes), increasingly likeable characters, a pretty good voice acting and big numbers of lines. It runs fast and smooth, the controls are easy (I played with an XBOX controller) and I picked it up very cheaply in a bundle. For which I feel like a thief now. I think I'm gonna buy one or another copy for the full price just because it seems that this game is a severly underrated gem.There is even an online versus mode as well as a mildly strategic single- and multiplayer co-op arena tower defense mode with leveling and item mechanics and stuff. In other games I would usually see such a multiplayer mode sceptical, but as the singleplayer portion of this game is already great enough I think this is pretty awesome to have. I played the co-op mode once with a Japanese and it worked (which is not self-evident in such games). I didn't notice severe lags or synchronisation issues despite the distance to the host. We (well, I at least) had a blast. I didn't understand all he said over his mic because I don't speak Japanese, but we ran over tons of monsters and my screen was all slash and boom and peng and pow. A few platforming sections I died in more often than I probably had to because the double-jump from the protagonist is not the most precise. There are some platforming and trap-evading parts where someone else might get a little frustrated, but I got through okay and the checkpoints in this game seem pretty fair.Also, the story and character relationships can be a little confusing. Some good thoughts went into it, that's for sure, there are lore hinches that I liked. In the end everything gets resolved fairly well, but in the middle the game sometimes lost me a bit. I don't know if that is because I didn't play the prequel ""X-Blades"" (which I sure will too soon). But, as mentioned, it finds a satisfying and understandable end.			",540,267,8,78,53,4,61

												It is hard to write a small review about a game that you are enjoying in some aspects but despising in others. I will keep it as short and simple as possible:Pro:-Gorgeous Environments, for the most part.-An (also for the most part) decent voice acting in all available languages (japanese best tho.)-Large Variety of Enemies with some fresh ideas-Good Animations-Nice Time Rewind Mechanic-Actually fun puzzling-A decent fighting system with awesome magic skills...Con:-...which sadly lacks ANY impact in normal swordfighting (not magic) due to horrible sound effects and just not really good audiovisual feedback. Seriously, for the most part it sounds like you would try to rub cardboard swords against a cardboard enemy. Often you can't tell if your attacks stagger an enemy or if he attacks back.-The controls, while fluid for the most part, just infuriate sometimes. WHY does the character stop after a jump, so you have to wait a second to run on? That just doesn't fit the gameplay. Same with dashing.-Some annoying glitches (rare though. I clipped through the ground twice, which is not gamebreaking but annoying.)-Horrible, horrible...HORRIBLE cutscenes. The characters move and act like paper. The voice acting, like stated in pro, is alright though.-While, like stated in pro, the environments and enemies are often enjoyable and lush, there are WAY too many muddy textures that should just not have been there. It really drags down the otherwise beautiful scenery.In the end it is still recommendable if you can overlook the lacking impact of fighting and some of the above issues. It is still fun, and while you will often shake your head about issues, the game is still...just, fun. Simple fun that the issues won't take away - luckily.Personal Score: 7,5/10			",226,58,13,37,7,0,18

												I played way more hours then stated on xbox and it was great those they had better combat in the non re-make version of the game. Story wise it actually good as you see her develop some caring nature later on due to story so she not completely annoying those every other game has the annnoying greedy character.Nice graphics desgined game for areas with hidden secrets.Combat a bit bad due to how limited your picks are compared to the previous version in which has waves and had it able to pre-select all the abilites from gathering souls without requiring to visit death statue.Cons wise it does make it about the sexy girls and guys.... yes it has a sexy guy with a ugly face those so yeah other reviews forget to mention this fact about the game.story 7/10 grahpics 8/10 due to played other games this does have qualitycombat 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrible Story (protagonist slaughters everyone in an area she has been in for 5min and then complains it being like a prison later), Identification with the main characters motives is almost impossible. Now you may say this is not an RPG or VN or stuff. Its H&S and story isnt all that important!! Well it seems combat wasnt that important for the development either. Its repetetive, boring and non rewarding. It comes down to getting those QTEs right and keep spamming the time rewind feature which gets utterly boring after it has been forced on you for the umptieth time for some brainless puzzle. Its also sometimes hard to tell weather what you are doing works on bosses which for i guess forced puzzle gameplay reasons are also often immune the rifle.Speaking of puzzles. Those are either simple or completely inane (jumping through whirling blades/lasers that will 1 hit you, atleast you can usually try it again right away, but they are still exteremly annoying.)The environment are also no master piece. Long stretches of just running around the scenery(extremely linear) interrupted by occasional fights and popping the compass to find hidden treasures (which sounds alot more exciting than it actually is)Multiplayer is dead and playing Outbreak mode by yourself gets old pretty quickly too.All in all this game gets barely a 4/10 from me and not recommended unless your main goal is staring at the protagonists♥♥♥♥♥ which is fine as long as you realize the game itself is crap.

												For a game I barely put a dent into playing when I first bought the game, I was excited and intrigued by the game play feels from the start. I will admit one of the sketchy bits of this game has to be that this game can become fairly straight forward from area to area, due to events of rocks falling or blocking certain passages once passed, or it's not the most clear game play in the world with a shaky camera before readjusting the settings to and fro for the mouse.Only issue that bothers me with this game has to be the settings for when you have a shoot a gun, because it bounces the camera too much once a shot is fired once.

												While this game has a really fun time mechanic and a decent combo system, it's just a frustraing experience. There's some weird difficulty spikes and and glitchy platforming as well. I could probably look past all of this, but the dialogue is just so...damn...bad. The protagonist spouts nonsensical lines that have nothing to do with what's going on and the writing is laughably bad. Add to that the fact that the story is just stupid and seems to go off in all different directions. I wanted to like this game and finish it, but between the cringe-worthy dialogue and the lame story I just simple cannot be compelled to continue. I would pass on this game. There are much better beat-em-ups out there to waste your time playing this one.			",315,121,0,22,8,2,8

												FIrstly, I should state that I got the game for the price of $1 as part of a humble bundle. At that price I would recommend it. Otherwise unfortunately I would advise people to stay away from this hack and slash.Pros:-Beatiful aesthetics and graphics(considering when it was made)-Combat feels smooth and responsive- Time rewind mechanic is inovative and offers a new element to the typical hack and slashCons:- The story is non existent- The voice acting and dialogue are one of the worst I have encountered- Puzzles are annoying and unimaginative (Excluding the desert level which i enjoyed)- The Time rewind mechanic is poorly implemented- Boss fights are poorly made with a few exceptions- Even though there is a good amount of different enemies it feels as if you are fighting the same two generic types each level-  The skills and combo system is poorly made in comparison to games like Castlevania, Dante's Inferno, Nier and even Wolverine.Overall, I would give this game a 5/10 and would thus not recommend it. If you are looking for a decent hack and slash game I can direct your attention towards Castlevania, Metal Gear Rising:Revengance and Prince of Persia: Warrior Within.			",94,28,0,12,5,3,14

												game has nice graphics, but that's it. Story is bad and makes no sense, controls feel very clunky WHEN they work, which they don't most of the time anyways. Can't play the game via my xbox 360 controller cause it doesn't recognize some of the inputs. When I play with keyboard, something keeps softlocking at least once an hour.. e.g. all of a sudden my character doesn't move anymore and just dashes around, or stops moving completely (while still attacking) or automatically throws in special attacks everytime it's possible even though I'm not clicking anything. Also, the puzzles are rather boring.. Time rewind is an interesting feature, but it's mostly just: stand on a platform, wait 20-30s, activate time rewind and run somewhere.. Doesn't feel all to intuitive. Luckily I only paid 3,5€ on humblebundle store for it, if I'd bought it for full price I'd be sad. Just do yourself a favor and stay away from this crap.. If you wanna play a good action-adventure, go play Devil May Cry or Darksiders or something.			",140,26,1,32,13,1,19

												I am very big on games having a proper and inviting beginning. Playing a game should make me want to play more of it. While the intro cinematic was a decent hook for the story and for answering the ""Why should I care about this character?"" part, the broken AI trigger forcing me to reload checkpoint and then the incredibly boring and tedious rail-shooter elements for the first 30 minutes = immediate uninstall.This is 2014. Forcing someone to play the game, without any introduction to the controls, and then forcing them to go through a scripted fighting sequence with allies that are invincible and do 0 damage while there's no obvious objective is just laughable.Do not play this game, unless you're a masochist.

												I know i have only played a hour but there were some things that bothered me really badly. I might pick this up again later on to play more but let me start off saying i was using a 360 controller when i played. Ok so when i first played this with a friend we did multiplayer which of course the lobby was empty. so no people. 2nd when we did play we had 0 clue what was going on. yes this was our first time playing. felt disappointed we both stopped. I decided to play single player and it was better for sure then multiplayer. people complained about the voice acting well of course i only hear 2 of them and i had no issues with them. the graphics were pretty nice and i have a crap system. the camera system didn't bother me too much either. so now you're probably wondering what my issues were. the controls for one were very unresponsive or did more then what i wanted. so for example when i did a jump i might start jumping all over the place when i only hit jump once. i over stepped many times because of this. no i didn't keep hitting jump to have this happen. another instance i walked on to a button and it started bouncing my toon around 5-6 jumps. lol i'm like really? i just stepped on it not jumping. lol. anyways the other was the attacking melee.  i noticed vs some of the mobs that it felt like you weren't hitting them or the death blow would not register and yes i was close to them. deathblow that annoyed me too. if you missed it felt like you had to beat them down to get it again. that made no sense to me. then it would come up again. i was like uh that is a bit annoying. even the rifle was annoying. when you first get it you don't really have any indicator on enemy health. you just keep swinging or firing away until they die.so those were my concerns and maybe it is a good game but those things really did get to me.

												Well that was a shame.Passable hack & slash ruined by 1. Trying to put literally every idea they had into the game until it becomes a confusing mess.2. Putting an unbeatable enemy in the gameThe first I can deal with by picking what works for me and ignoring the 18 other mechanics they've ham-fisted into a single title and also the journey is reasonably pretty. What is unforgivable is the 3-4 times I've had to shut this game down because I can't get out of a tiny room with an unkillable creature. It's rage-inducing and it shouldn't happen.For me this game stops here.			",287,79,11,33,39,6,54

												I was really looking forward to a good DMC style game with swords and guns but this fell short. The controls are awkward and the camera is worse. Gamepad support is not optimized either.The graphics leave much to be desired as well. Subtitles were inaccurate and often dialog got cut off by in game action.Only good point is that I got it on Humble so at least my wasted money went to something useful.			",241,65,7,29,26,0,25

												This is possibly the worst game I have ever played, and I am old enough to have played E.T. on the Atari 2600 at the house of the ""lucky kid"" who got it for Christmas.  Who mentioned Shadows of Mordor in comparison?  Yes, they both have swords.  Yes, they both run on PCs.  That exhausts my list of things they share in common.You'll notice that all of the gamplay footage is in slow motion.  That's because at normal speed, the combat looks like a cappucin monkey with a sword who somehow ingested methamphetamine.  Your results will, absolutely, vary.  The animations, sound, and subtitles do not match in any way at all.  I feel like someone gave me a very naughty drug; I have no idea what's going on and everything that happens is freaking me out.I'll bet any amount of money that Duke Nukem Forever is way more fun.

												I am rather glad I recieved this game in a bundle and not at full retail price. It is a decent little hack'n'slash, some of the names chosen for areas and landmarks etc are a little generic, it shouldn't matter though, but I found it a bit irritating. The main reason I don't recommend this game is because of the voice (acting) and dialog chosen for the main protagonist. Ayumi the leading lady is constantly whining and complaining about almost everything. Ayumi is awlays talking aloud, there is very little silence. Which also brings me to the player being babied. Ayumi is always saying aloud what you should do, no matter how obvious the scene already is for the player. Bleh.			",344,50,17,50,24,3,48

												I only played for about 1 hour, so you can decide if you can take my advice or not.Lets start saying that i thought this game was bad since i saw it. I was wrong, i can admit that.First of all, the game has decent graphics, not awesome, but allright for a mid budget game. I have seen(heard) better voice acting, not game breaking, but it takes some points from the overall score.What is most important for me is the gameplay, which is what it made me decide to uninstall (not that ill never play it, but i will send it way back on the queue in my library). The mechanics are actually almost rock solid, jumps, attacks, everything reacts fine as it should there is almost as solid as God of war except for 1 little detail.when you use your attacks to test them, or against the air, well, you notice that you are hitting air. The problem is that when you hit an enemy or object, or the wall, you feel exactly the same, squat, nada. You cant feel the power behind your blows. You hit an enemy, you see that you are hitting them, yet you dont feel it on your control (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYEebRNb0ag  Minute 20 as an example, when he breaks a crate, then he hits a large enemy 10-15 seconds later). In any hack/slash buttonmash game, when you hit an enemy, there is a proper reaction, either a combo hitcounter, some reaction of pain of the enemy, maybe slower attacks from your part. i dont know, something. In this game you feel like you are slashing leaves every single time,.even the old snes beat em ups got those things right. I could kept playing, the mechanics are solid enough, i could bear the voice acting, couldnt complain about the graphics neither or the frenetic camera (yeah, you can dash and the camera moves a bit violently) , its just that i felt that my mouseclicks were worthless. there is no epicness in this. It felt empty/weak.For better understanding of what i am saying. Imagine you are playing street fighter. You get in CQC, you throw a fierce punch to your enemy in the face, you hitted him, you see his health bar going down, yet there was no proper animation, your fist just went trought his face, yet worse, since you didnt altered his animation he can actually counter, and you will see your character on the ground, less health, but you just never felt a thing.So yes, small detail, game breaker for me. I wouldnt get this game unless it comes in a bundle or if its really cheap, less than 5 USD and i still would doubt it. And thats why i cant recommend the game, otherwise, this could be a little jewel.			",469,80,20,49,31,2,78

												Why bother with a mediocre to poor consile port when there are much better games out there. Controls and camera can be frustrating, the dialogue and voice acting is so bad it actually makes me angry, puzzle direction is either not needed or just not there, a pointless walk mechanic but no run meaning the fastest method of travel is a 10 ft dash over and over again, poor combat.... I could go on but you get the idea.			",1001,286,28,129,68,11,189

												This game is garbage, as in 'it don't work'.  Most of the characters and some of the objects are just white texture-less shapes.  The game runs good on my pc, otherwise, but there is virtually no tech support.  I've been trying to fix the issue for a couple of days, and after searching and searching I've found nothing, and no likelihood that the developers care at all about fixing the problem, as most of the questions to them on their own website return with no answers from the devs.I'd advise anybody considering this to check out the demo first to make sure it works.

												Hmm... shame there's only a thumbs up or a thumbs down really. It's a middle of the road kinda game.From what I've played so far, it seems to be a fun little hack-and-slash, a few simple puzzles here and there but nothing too taxing.The special abilitys and combos are a little redundant, as just mashing LMB will see you through most fights.Suffers with dreadful acting and a weak plot, but if you're just looking for a simple, fun timewaster you could do a lot worse.It all come's down to personal opinion as to whether the manga-staple, scantily clad, buxom, vapid, pigtailed protaganist is an actual selling point, or just a cheap ploy by the developers to catch the interest of testosterone fueled adolescents who havn't discovered that there's a wealth of internet pornography out there with real women in it...If you've got a couple of quid to spare, and it's in a sale, go for it - but don't expect anything groundbreaking in terms of plot or mechanics.

												I really don't like to be treated like a 6 year old.After first 10 minutes of the game I found myself telling the character I was playing to shut the hell up. She is narrating EVERYTHING.... The intro didn't tell player anything, only raised many questions, which she is trying to somehow answer by speaking out loud every stupid thing that pops in her head. A trait which is annoying in real life, so much more annoying in game where it's not a dialog but monolog.In adventures generally character sometimes say something, they have their catch phrases or they comment something sometimes and not everything everytime, .. It was like Gandalf in the last Hobit movie - a walking dictionary - e.g. ""oh, these must be the legendary guardians, they really are made of stone, who would have though?"" - and I ask, who the hell cares? my blades still went through them, didn't they? ... I mean, if it's not helpful or funny, keep it to yourself, honey.Oh and one more thing - her outfit, really? She looks like dressed for an orgy,... clearly a great outfit for a tresure hunter ;)			",42,2,0,9,0,1,12

												Ok, so now that I have got a refund...Blades of Time is actually a decent game - the graphics are decent, the gameplay *overall* is ok, sound and and so forth are fine - it's a decent hack-&-slash that's the dodgy offspring of Tombraider crossed with, oh I dunno, God of War...?Something like that.BUT:It's - as others have said - really rough around the edges, and the combat is ridiculous; not so much ""normal"" combat - (though in fairness even with different enemies it's still - ""Do these moves with this one, and these moves with that one"") - but boss fights are AWFUL.Awful - in part because the controls are hugely unresponsive in fighting, and Ayumi will oftentimes simply stand completely still whilst being 1 shot killed again, and again, and again.Now I like a hard fight don't get me wrong, but mixed with terrible, rough controls - Nah, unplayable and not for me.If you can get past that there's a decent game under it all, but to be honest if you've got the cash spare, there's plenty out there for the same price that's better, even with it's ""Time Dynamic"".

												Yikes, guys. Really, this was a kick in the nuts. I grabbed this in a bundle (I'd had my eye in it for a while; ain't no hate for a decent God o' War clone) and figured it would at least amount to a couple of hours of hacky-slashy, but no. No no no. The cinematic animations let you know, off the bat, that this game is going to be lousy. That's not a superficial point -- you sort of have to see it to know what I mean. And then the gameplay -- which amounts to maybe a minute's worth of button-mashing in-between ten minutes of cinematics and the most depressing voice acting since I don't know when -- gives you a bit of hope. It's pleasingly ballistic to the eye, and yet the feel/impact/whatevever you want to call it is unsatifyingly light-handed, like beating tin cans with plastic spoons. To keep this short, I'll just say this: This game, not unlike your average DC movie (OHHHHHHH!!!11) makes for great trailers, but the finished product is better left on the shelf. Because, like a DC Movie (OHHHHHH!!!!111one), everything is kind of okay for a while, and then it starts...SecondbySecondNarration.  *Standing in fire* Oh, there’s fire up in hurr. Better not walk into that or else.*Looks at wall* This is the something or something of whathaveyou, insert GENEREIC-AS-F*CK-fantasy-name here (Seriously, the world is called “Dragonland”).”You know, I thought I’d have a number of clever little examples for this part, but I’m just not emotionally capable of putting more effort into reviewing this game. Just don’t do it. There are better hack n’ slash games out there, and if you're that desperate to have your hack n' slash with some gratuitous sex on the side, you are seriously better off grabbing a used PlayStation 3 and Bayonetta (or a WiiU if you hate yourself) than subjecting yourself to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ constant narration.Seriously, I’m not even trying to be a prick, here, but I want to know who played through this game with that INCESSANT NARRATION and thought, “Yeah, this is good. People will like this.” I mean COME ON, GUYS.			",241,63,4,23,7,2,25

												I've only just started playing this and here are my thoughts so far.The game starts off with an awkward cinematic and this is before you even get to the main menu. Like the cinematic looks epic in my opinion, but it makes absolutely no sense. There was an initiation to figure out who goes to Dragonland, then the bad guys the ones who seem bad come in and try to steal the sphere to Dragonland and the good guy just let's them take the sphere and go to Dragonland.I find this weird as it doesn't explain anything as to why they are going to Dragonland, why you play as the people who seem bad in the opening cinematic, why the good guy jus let the evil people have the sphere. It all makes no sense.This may all be explained as I play more, but for now it's all confusing as hell. Which isn't good to make people confused before they even get to the main menu! But now onto my thoughts.The Positive:♦ The scenery and graphics looked pretty cool and unique♦ The Platforming seemed cool♦ I like how everything is read to you♦ I like how the inventory is in the form of a handbook ♦ The unqiueness of the enemies are cool and the number of different ones are awesome♦ I liked the combat style and the gun.♦ I liked the way you get spells ♦ I like how you can press ""E"" on a nearly dead enemy to do a special and finish them♦ I like the idea of using a compass to find hidden objects and to find the main objectiveThe Negative:♦ The voice of your character was weird and annoying, some of the things she said was obvious beyond belief and unneeded. ♦ Characters Face is messed up graphics wise♦ The story seems to start in the middle... as explained above with the openeing cinematic. It could be a mad story and well written... but it seems to leave major parts out. For example who is Zero, why is he so important, why are we going to Dragonland etc etc. It all just seems to start in the middle. It may explain more as I play... but they needed more backstory (I thought there was a prequel that I missed or something, but nope).♦ It seems Repetitive as. Go here, kill these, learn these, repeat. ♦ I haven't come accross any puzzles yet... if they are supposed to puzzles then well uh, they suck beyond repair. ♦ Whole game seems too easy♦ I dislike the timestop spell, don't get me wrong it's cool as it stops time, but to me it seems like they didn't implement it well to make use of it's coolness. It just seems to be there to make it almost near impossible to kill enemies with it. ♦ Absolutely no challenges♦ I dislike how 90% of the game so far that I've played is go here, kill these enemies, oh look a wall, walk some more, step on a button, kill some more enemies, walk back the way you came and now the wall is open. Repeat. ♦ Dislike the gun having unlimited ammo, this makes it way too easy and unrealistic.♦ Needs to be more weapon types and different guns to make it slightly more interesting♦ Spells are just given to you and are given pretty fast. They say you need to collect souls or something from enemies you destroy to unlock them, but the spells seemed to just be handed to you which is lame. It gives you no incentive to actually want to kill everything.♦ Spells seem pointless and not needed as you can easily kill enemies without them♦ The compass is cool but it's pointless as you can easily find everything without it. It doesn't add to the game anything you couldn't do without. Thus as cool as it is, it is pointless.Glitches:♦ At some points, I lost control to my spells, gun reloading and compass. The only way to fix this was to quit the game and re-open it. Really annoying.On a whole the game in my opinion has awesomeness too it, don't get me wrong. Like the way you get and use spells, can dash to enemies, can find things with a compass, can stop time and the way you fight with meelee is awesome!Although that is all good, it is poorly implemented along with the storyline. TimeStop seems cool until you realize all it does is make you fight enemies for years, spells seems unneeded, the compass doesn't really help (You could find everythign without it) and learning to use spells as cool as it is, seems pointless when they are self explanitory things like fire, freeze, critical strike etc.I'd give it an overall raiting of 2.5/5.

(Oh you learned how to beat this mini boss? Now do it 4 more times before you move on)- Controls sometimes bug out. Nothing more aggrivating than restarting because your health ability refused to activate- The basic definition of a button masher. mash sword attack, dodge roll, repeat.- Difficulty is a joke. By the time you even unlock the hardest difficulty, you are so stupidly overpowered that it becomes more of a grind as you wipe out every cannon fodder enemy in your path.			",62,13,0,9,5,2,1

												In Blades of Time, you play as Treasure hunter, Samurai, and accomplished pornstar Ayumi as she explores the deep depths of a volcano with nothing on but a bikini. Equipped with nothing but your trusty swords, compass, and annoying fake British Accent, you set out on an adventure worthy of being turned off after 2 hours, never to be played again.I give this game a♥♥♥♥♥♥out of ten.

												Recommended only if the price is $5 or less.Gameplay 5/10Graphics 6/10Voice acting 6/10Story  6/10Thank god, there are cheats available, otherwise i would give up.It's getting boring and tedious to slash same enemies over and over.The game can be pretty relaxing if you use god mode and one hit kill, just browsing around and staring at the pretty girl's butt.Except a few unique mechanics the gameplay is pretty mediocre.Cutscenes are pretty much every 2 minutes.I would give this game a thumbs down, only to balance the overall score.At the moment it says ""very positive"", should be ""mostly positive"" or ""mixed"" in my opinion.

												Ayumi, the gorgeous gun and sword-wielding treasure hunter, sets out on a journey to an ancient island in search of new adventures. While rich in bounty, the island is also filled with the magic of Chaos, being at the same time home to blood thirsty monsters. With a host of colorful characters, eye-popping visual appeal, tons of treasure and a huge variety of combat skills to master, Blades of Time will bring just as much fun and satisfaction both to gamers that are new to the action adventure genre and to experienced players.

												This game starts off as a simple God of War clone, but then spices it up with some neat time-traveling mechanics and ranged weapons, along with a spell system. Unfortunately, it hobbles itself with a control scheme that is sometimes unwilling to respond or very particular (to the point of effectively not responding) to key presses. This, ultimately, makes the game frustrating to play and, in a sea of quality games on Steam, especially compared to other God of War clones like Darksiders, it's just not worth your time.

												So Blades of Time... i played the original, and it was ahn, ok, not very good but yeah, worked in the end, now Blades f time is an ""spiritual sucessor"" but as an hack and slash its very good, the controls are rock solid, the graphics, not AAA but well done and colorfull, the history, meh, its weak but the lore is very well done, you can also count with multiplayer(dota style), Co-op, vs, 1 dlc wich tells you why a certain boss dissapear after mid game, and some decent extras if you get the limited edition, worth it? If you like H&S hell yeah, if its not your kind of game give a try with steam sales or some coupom.Então, blades of time... Eu joguei o original e, é ele era bonzinho até, mas esta nova versão, que alias é um ""sucessor espiritual"" ou reboot da série é um hack em slash muito bom, os controles são solidos, graficos não são maravilhosos, mas são bonitos e bem feitos, ja a história, bom esse nunca foi o ponto forte mas até que e boa, tem muito conteudo e informação espalhada, só que o final é um gancho de continuação inacreditavel, e isso chateia um pouco.Alem do modo história tambem temos multiplayer, a la dota, co-op, vs, 1 dlc legalzinha que explica o sumiço de um certo boss no meio do jogo e mais alguns extras da edição limitada, vale a pena? Se voce curte H&S com certeza! Se não é muito a sua praia, experiemente pegar no steam slaes ou com cupons, voce pode se impressionar.			",493,154,18,54,29,3,55

												Blades of Time is probably best compared to Darksiders and God of War; hordes of enemies ready to die, simple but smooth combat techniques. It delivers much more. Although it has two difficulties, the game will adjust in subtle ways after loading from a save game, slowly increasing until it gives you a distinct advantage, however never feeling like it's belittleing you, just that the game is trying to keep the flow going.It borrows an element from Prince of Persia, allowing you to rewind time, however this creates ""clones"" of your actions, with the only limit being how many clones your computer can render until it crashes. There is something deeply satisfying about seeing a boss drop from full health to no health in a second or two thats not found elsewhere that I know of.One last tidbit. This has to be the only game I've played (at least to memory) where as the female lead gets further into the game her clothes get less revealing, whilst still giving off a sexy vibe.

												This is a much better game than []X-Blades[/url]. Both are hack and slash with an exact same character name but what makes Blades of Time special is the time manipulation as the game mechanics. It reminds me of Prince of Persia, but with crappy gun controls.The story is mediocre at the start and not intriguing(I haven't completed the game yet). You use a compass to navigate to your objective, but is not necessary as the level design is very linear. Treasure chests are easy to spot as they glow except some are hidden unless you use a magic sphere barrier.The enemies sometimes take too long to kill or are bullet sponges. Dodging is floaty and as you use melee with swords it doesn't feel punchy or satisfied hitting the enemies. Execution is somewhat passable, magic attacks use a skull orb on set gauge bar that you can fill the bar with attacks. That limits the number of magical abilities you can use.So far the first boss ignored every range attack and in that area I assume I need to stand on a platform switch to reveal its weak spot. But no, you have to glide/ fly to its limbs to cut it down with no tips indicating it.Overall, I find it okay and the platform session is much weaker compared to Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider. But if you want a female protagonist with time bending abilities, this is the only game I can think of that offered it.			",281,33,7,33,13,1,23

												Crimminaly underrated action game with sick combos , and a unique time travel gimmick that adds a lot of depth to the combat , platforming , and puzzles.  Teh combat is rich and rewarding , but the puzzles and platforming can often be frustrating. The story is dreadful , the voice acting is awful , and the graphics are outdated . In short the game is a flawed gem. I'd reccommed the game to anyone who likes a good action game in the same vein is devil may cry or god of war.			",162,16,0,36,2,0,16

												Went into this game blind, hand even heard of it before, not watched the trailer, literally nothing. Think I paid overall about 50p - £1 as it was part of a bundle, so the store price doesnt reflect why I bought it. Firstly would this game be worth £20 to me, yes, I love this game to peices even though i havn't finished it yet. It has story mode and a multiplayer mode, so you will be playing this for hours! love the game play, reasonably good story (so far) and generally just fun to play for hours at a time despite how it puts you into boss fights without any help, it makes it a challange, thats one of the better parts of this game, there is a very fine learning curve and you can feel yourself moving along it, unlocking new abilities, watching your characters power grow. and for a 3 year old game, the visuals are spectacular, you really feel like you're on dragon island. :D 11/10 would recomend for the price!

												Overall, BoT is a pretty decent game.Combat is pretty good, but is made really interesting with this game's eponymous feature: time manipulation.  Essentially, you can do something, such as attack an enemy, and then rewind, and your previous actions will be enacted again by another (short-lived) you, while you can also do something, such as also attacking an enemy. This makes for interesting battles into which you're able to incorporate a good amount of strategy, which helps prevent the monotony of hacking and slashing so much.  However, this power is also poorly utilized, such as with annoying doors which you need to open, but since they then close nearly immediately, you must rewind time and wait for yourself (in the other timeline) to unlock it again and then quickly dash through.If story/dialogue is something you focus on in games, this games' story is confusing and hard to follow, due to the very poor dialogue.  This is exacerbated by trying to make some characters talk in Old English-style (eg: ""Thou dost..."").  This is very poorly executed, and sounds extremely awkward.  Furthermore, some of the regular dialogue is just silly or sounds weird or unnatural.On a brighter note, the game is relatively well optimized and runs quite well.  The scenery is quite imaginative and often is very beautiful.  I think I've taken more screenshots of this game than all the other games combined.			",179,88,3,17,23,0,29

												Decent Game,Not a bad game really. Over priced so buy if on sale or even better part of a cheap bundle. Game reminds me of a Tomb Raider and God of War offspring picking up some bad habits of sands of time. Game would be way better if it had full controller support. Only played a couple of hours and got pretty tired of watching the same attack animations over and over. Probably worth 1 play thru and then moving on.			",93,17,10,21,7,0,36

												""Blades of Time"", a 3rd person hack & slash in the manner of ""Devil May Cry"", is a game where nothing feels quote right.You are a scantily-clad blond treasure hunter named Ayumi (I guess the developers where watching watching/reading too many animes/mangas), who is transported to Dragonland (because magic) where there's untold treasure (because ancient legends), and of course, a warmongering Chaos demon (because ancient prophecy). And you are sort of in the middle of all this, and hack & slash your way through without true reasons.Extremely crappy story aside, there's much wrong with this title.First, the visuals. What seems a lush and vibrant world at first glance, is really just a stiff, brightly-colored jungle. Ayumi just clips through the greenery, the leaves and grass are mostly static. Dragonland felt like a colorful dead world. Character animations are stiff, too. What look like detailed models from afar are revealed to be really mediocre ones. But, this is a budget title, so the graphics issues are truly the least concern.What is a huge issue are the gameplay and the controls.Ayumi moves too fast. She jumps too high. Controlling her never feels alright. Precision jumping is almost impossible. Even walking narrow ledges is a challenge due to speedy movement. The enemies have no ""meat"". Ayumi's swords just sort of pas through them, and then they eventually fall down. The combo system is poor, and the melee deteriorates into mindless button mashing. The shooting part of combat seems tacked-on and minimally refined.Add to all this the fact you have to constantly bear with Ayumi's babbling, presented via poor and annoying voice-work...Ugh, There's much to quit ""Blades of Time"", and very little to stick to it.

												There are so many things about this that are less worse than X-Blades, and it's almost even good in some ways, but there are enough unpolished things and irritating mechanics that I couldn't push through it. The combat is much faster and smoother for the most part (ignoring anything using the gun, which is awful), but that only brings it to sort of mediocre up from atrocious in the previous game. The writing/characters/story/etc. are a completely different kind of bad/annoying compared to before. There's about three times as much dialogue as there needs to be, and the main character will not ever shut up. It's definitely a step in the right direction, but it's also still definitely not worth playing.			",499,202,15,84,46,6,86

												I wouldn't say that this game is Hack & Slash at its finest... for me it's just a hair above mediocre. It's decent Visually. Great music. Story is ok. Voice acting.. meh. Gameplay is somewhat fluid, but not as good as say the DmC reboot.Did it pass the time for me in an entertaining fashion? Yes it did! So it gets a thumbs up.If you're looking for a new Hack & Slash experience.. and this game is one sale.. try it on.			",170,5,3,3,3,0,0

												Blades of Time is a nice 3rd person action game with some cool mechanics and it looks good to boost. The enviroments are nice and varied, the enemies less so, but fun to fight nonetheless. Fighting is pretty standard, normal attacks, magic attacks, and even 3rd person shooting.The most notable mechanic is time manipulation, and you can have some pretty cool fun with it, distracting enemies with shields with a clone while you sneak behind them where they're vulnerable, piling up on them with 3 of your clones shooting a minigun at one enemy, attacking them with swords on all sides. It's pretty fun. It's also used for solving puzzles. They're not exactly brain teasers, but serve a purpose to mix things up.There are secrets to find, some items to collect, and a co-op mode that i haven't tried but that seems to be dead. Try it with a friend if you can.Also, to my great surprise seeing as how rarely games support that, even some big name developers don't seem to grasp the concept - this game supports hybrid gamepad and mouse input. Your mouse isn't disabled if you use a gamepad. This is especially good for Steam controller users, and the game is a delight to play as a result of that because you have better precission while shooting and are not limited to analog speeds. All in all, this is a great port, no issues whatsoever, and the devs actually understood how to program the game for a PC. It's amazing how big name studios tend to mess up ports, but a smaller studio makes a good job.The colors are a bit washed up, i guess that's the aesthetic they were going for, i didn't care much for that, but you can fix it as you like with SweetFX easily though so no big deal.The story starts interesting, then looses itself a bit from the middle to the end, but all in all it's ok. If you want a good story play some RPG's or something. The story here is adequate, nothing horrible, nothing impressive.Very recommended. If you have doubts, get it on sale.			",91,31,3,17,7,0,9

												For me this game was slighty above avarage. Graphics and location design is nice. There are various locations, which requires player to use slightly different playstyles. Overall idea with time rewind is reused from other titles, but I think it is also highly abused by game mechanics. There are a lot of things player just must do the way game designers want him to. I dislike that. If someone likes hard games, this one is a good choice. Controls are not very good. Tried both keyboard+mouse and xbox360 controller and I did not feel confortable with any of those. DLC is short, but fun to play. Overall I would rate this somewhere around 6/10. Recommended for hardcore hack&slash players.			",76,11,1,17,1,0,12

												It's no masterpiece like Devil May Cry or Metal Gear Rising, but it is still one of the better hack n slash games out there. The time manipulation mechanic is well implemented, it's not just for solving puzzles but can be useful in combat as it allows you to create multiple clones of yourself. Another good thing about this game is how it handles firearms, most hack n slash games that feature guns rely too heavily on auto-aiming while this game treats guns how any good 3rd person shooter would. Some of the dialogue feels a bit ""out of place"", but overall this is a great title and you should definetly give this one a try if you enjoy these types of games.			",109,6,0,10,1,0,2

												Sooo, when loading up the game, Ayumi's face completely ♥♥♥♥ed up. Maybe it's because I'm a mac user, but when I loaded up the game the beginning animation was fine until the title screen appeared, and her face just got completely ♥♥♥♥ed up. Tried exiting and reloading the game, nothing worked, also got an error at one point. Not sure how to fix it...looks like an interesting and fun game but the fact that chunks of her face is missing and I can see her eye and teeth animation floating around is making it hard for me to play. DXEverything else looks fine, just the face glitch is really throwing me off. DXEDIT // It appears after restarting the game a total of 7-odd times the glitch has been fixed, and I'm having fun playing it. Hope it doesn't happen again, and if it does, well, it's humorous to say the least.			",48,15,0,9,6,0,4

												before playing this game, remember that we are now in the distant future, 2016.It is very fun and colorful!  Gameplay similar to God of War, with Tomb Raider/Drake style story.   The hack and slash is very fun and very smooth and pretty.The character is constantly talking, but its often sassy.  It seems like she is talking to herself a lot, but she has a pleasant voice and enjoyable dialogue.

												The writing of this game is so hilariously bad it was not even a con in my opinion, because it's so bad you'll literally just laugh at every second line anyone utters. Aside from that, the gameplay is a decently put together blend between DMC's stylish and demanding elements and GoW's slightly more brainless hack 'n slash style, very fluent, albeit lacking hit feedback on occasions.Overall, if you can overlook the poor writing, you will enjoyably sink quite a few hours into it.

For me this is a big deal , and in this case it was important because the english voicing is just bad, so bad. i had to switch right after the intro... subtitles are not completely accurate, but it's good enough.

												The game feels like a Devil May Cry bootleg and it certainly is not AAA quality. Suprisingly enjoyable if you can stay with it past the first few levels. Nice atmosphere for an original setting, it managed to instill a certain sense of wonderment/exploration in me despite being linear. Some great eye candy too (especially in compass view). I had a lot of fun with it. The lighting (bloom) is hilarious at times, but not a big issue. The mechanic of being able to rewind time at will and then attack alongside your ghostly image deserves particular praise as it's fairly unique. The story has the usual twists but I felt they were well executed - some of my guesses were wrong. There is a multiplayer component (a kind of MOBAesque duel) but it lacks matchmaking - looks like you need to invite a person.			",373,161,13,64,42,6,90

You go on an adventure to find hidden treasures and slay hordes of enemies that stand on your way. You can use powerful combos to defeat enemies - in which you can stop and rewind time, which sometimes is the only way to deal with a powerful boss or a puzzle. Blades of Time has some challenging boss fights, pretty fine storyline, various beautiful landscapes and also very playable MOBA-like multiplayer. It's definietely worthy of giving it a try!7/10			",91,13,4,15,7,0,9

A few of the puzzles are really stupid to the point of you completing them  by accident.

												I found this game to be about average across the board. The combat is decent and the envirioments are pretty for its time and specs. The time mechanic is fun but can be op at times but frustrating at others. Game has some light puzzle elements but is very much a traditional hack n slash. If your a fan of the genre you will find a decent time here just dont expect too much from this game. For non genre players the game may seem a bit flat and too much of a clunky button masher. One important thing though is change the audio language to japanese or one of the others because the english voice acting is god awful and if you do miss the ocasional caption you wont be missing asnything worthwhile as the dialog is abysmal as well.Main draws: fun time mechanic, bog standard hack n slash fun, decent visuals, decent controlsMain gripes: God awful english and dialog, incoherent story, terrible shooting mechanicReminds me of: Tomb raider (style/presentation), Devil may cry (mechanics), Prince of Persia (mechanics)For: People looking for a hack n slash game on the cheap to hold them over in between other games.Price: Wait till on some super sale below 10 dollars.

												Needed 9h to finish story on hardest dif. Good story, I went completely MAD in the very end. No Spoilers. Dont read the Achievements (dont know if they were secret, but i prefer not to be spoiled to death).The gameplay is like a training room, you always do the same, but really soon start to realize how you can do better, faster, harder, and improve over time. At one point i even felt completely stupid thinking about how bad I played this game the hours before. Unlike many reviews say, I was completely ok with the controls. Maaayyybe dont bring a gun to a swordfight but it really wasnt THAT bad. Yes, they ask for time warp very often, but really, I dont see why that would be something bad. 100% of a Prince of Persia fan speaking.Good for a playthrough. Good for listening to the english accent of a nice voice. I had to switch from german voiceover because its also Ariel Hanson in Starcraft II. Which means shes the 100%-cliché-""im-so-helpless-wooman-plis-halp"" to me for the rest of her voice acting life. Sorry.8/10. Not any lower. metacritics lost believability to the korean in me.Shes close to naked? Sorry, didnt see, was busy dashing around like a crazy frog in hope to find lore which was hidden in totally different kind of places and easter eggs that didnt exist. -1 to rating for that.7/10 Finally.

												Pretty good game, I rate it a 6/10 and I've also played the DLC which was a pretty fun 1 hour or so. My finger kind of hurt after playing too much, though. The melee combat needs to be more in depth, but I guess it's fine since this game is only 10 bucks. Great deal. Too many reused models, but everything looks fantastic and some of the enemies are cool as hell.			",17,2,0,5,0,0,0

Main charcter voice (7/10 annoing), mediocre story (as it seems) and complete lack of defense other than pure evasion (which still isn't as effective as you are probably used to). If, like me, you are a fan of spectacle fighters you can dismiss first two - they doesn't stand in the way of button mashing. Third one?

												A fairly solid game, the time mechanic is unique albeit not necessarily implemented the greatest. The story and voice acting leave much to be desired and the combat while very fast and fun the normal attacks don't have much weight behind them. The spells though have real impact and are where the real weighty attacks come from. fairly well paced and some really cool character designs. not something to get at full asking price but on a sale or humble bundle it is definitely worth a play. I beat the game in just over 7 hours without any explicit exploring for hidden treasure so if that seems long enough for you give it a purchase.			",95,20,0,29,6,2,14

												Blades of Time was a rough play for me.  There was obviously an attempt to make a solid action RPG here, but the game is bogged with problems!  - Enemies attack you through combos with no real recourse except to range them.  - Combat is ""feathery"", lacking any weight or strength.  - You spend a good portion of the game using the same combo attack over and over followed by a few exection skills to   finish off foes.  -The aming is loose and floaty, never feeling like you are actually aiming anything. - Sound production is horrible, giving little feedback to the world and your interactions with it.  - Interactive Objects are covered in the same grey/brown-mid-2000's color scheme making them easy to miss.-The camera has a mind of its own, often swinging around awkwardly and hiding enemies from view. - I stopped caring about the story ten minutes in.  It's cliched and typical and the stilted dialogue is entirely exposition.- Blades of Time is an attempt to blend God of War with Tomb Raider and fails to capture any of what makes either of those games great.- Enemies lack personality and originality- The jumping is quick and hard to controlIn closing, I couldn't do it.  Everything wrong with the first few minutes of the game is everything wrong period.  The camera, the controls, the uninspired world, the lazy enemy concepts, the bad combat, the terrible writing, the odd and exaggurated physics and the horrendously-bad Lara Croft impression was enough to make me put this one down for good.
