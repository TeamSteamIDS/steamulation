												This game is brilliant. It has one main strength that makes it a true gem, but it might be often overlooked: this game has two faces really.At first glance it seems like a very casual but pleasant puzzle platformer. The levels are fun, they require a little bit of figuring out but nothing too complicated. You can pretty much play through the main 100 levels of this game like that without even realising there's more to it. This makes the game appeal to those gamers who just enjoy to chill out.But there's a lot more this game is hiding... As you'll find out if you try earning fancier flowers, which requires completing levels within a strict time limit. You'll soon realise that for many levels those basic obvious methods of solving them that you used so far don't really work if you want to be fast enough. You suddenly learn the game has a number of undocumented features... little tricks you can do that may even look like exploits, allowing you to skip parts of the levels... But no! You're actually supposed to do all that! Those tricks aren't easy to pull off and getting good enough times is really challenging. Suddenly the casual chill-out game becomes a test of skill comparable to Super Meat Boy. And if you manage to get through all that too and you think you're done... Nope! Super-hard bonus levels are unlocked. If you manage to 100% this game, you're really really good.This all makes Offspring Fling a great little game for both casual gamers and the most hardcore players. I'm very positively surprised, because initially when I started playing it, it seemed very generic and not standing out in any way. I saw very simplistic graphics and simple puzzles like in million other flash games published on various websites. I was wrong. I was completely wrong. Please take my word for it and don't get the wrong impression like I did. This game is a true masterpiece.			",754,315,16,92,65,9,123

												This game literally caused a blister in my thumb, but after getting 100% completition, I finally feel ready to review this game properly.As you may have already read from other reviews here, Offspring Fling hides much more than it seems at a first glance. Playing this game casually results into a peaceful experience with a puzzle platformer with short levels and easy-to-get mechanics, including the basic as jumping, grabbing, throwing... But playing this game in a serious way uncovers the true potential it has to offer. Offspring Fling is actually a game crafted for people who loves to speedrun, and challenge you not only to beat the levels, but also to do that in a certain time mark. Most of them are extremely tight and accurate, and involves doing very hidden skills that could even look like game flaws for some people, while they're actually crucial techiques in order to beat most levels in time. Even the most basic techniques require a huge amount of timing if you want to do all the tricks this game has; it's even comparable to executing long combos in fighting games, no joking.If anyone of you check my game stats, you'll see that there's a lapse of TWO YEARS between some achievements. This proves how much time I've been denying this game 'cause it basically felt too strong to me back then. But after 2 years playing A LOT of platformers, I eventually felt ready for Offspring Fling, and even like that it's been a true challenge for me.All in all, this game can be played by anybody no matter what's your purpose in games (either casual or hardcore gaming), and will successfully give you what you want. Nevertheless after taking the challenge I truly recommend playing this game for the time trial stuff since you'll be surprised about how deep and complex this title is. Final Mark: My Blistered Thumb UP.			",308,68,8,26,7,2,10

												Offspring Fling is secretly two games.The first is the game you are presented with, a very light-hearted and somewhat simplistic puzzle-platformer where you pick up your babies and toss them around to get them to the exit. 100 levels plus a level editor go by relatively quickly.Underneath that is a very technical speedrun game, almost like a classic speedrun game like Super Meat Boy or Dustforce. Lots of minor optimizations and hidden tricks that mean you can do a lot more than you initially thought, and do it much faster. It opens up every level to be re-analyzed again, this time looking for optimal strategies.I recommend this game regardless of which kind of game you prefer.			",225,73,1,60,21,4,40

												Ow. That reset button is torture. It hurts.As a puzzle game, this is just sweet. But you'll try to beat the clock and then it becomes the opposite of sweet. Stop it, you'll hurt yourself.The game is lovely. Graphics are pixelly and retro-ish, instead of jaw-droppingly shiny and sparkly, but don't judge this one by it's screenshots. The artwork and music/sfx are both fitting and kid-friendly in my opinion. Puzzles start easy enough and don't seem too hard to figure out. Then of course you try to do them in the shortest time possible which ups the difficulty considerably. Puzzles require some cranial commitment and dexterous digits but so far i wouldn't say either the puzzles or the platforming is too difficult.Recommended to fans of puzzle/platform games. Well designed and polished with good controls.""I hit the reset button so much i woke up on some dude's table and was instructed to kill Strelok""Nice game/Nice game			",70,24,8,13,26,0,19

												Another day, another puzzle platformer, this one featuring a cute cabbit thing that rescues its babies by throwing them as projectile weapons.Thumbs down for me because this game really hits a sour spot: as a puzzle game it is uninteresting and absurdly easy (easily under 2 hours to complete ""all"" 100 levels). The secret is that this 100 is only ~30% completion -- unlocking levels 101-110 requires fast speed-runs of the first 100, and to unlock 111-120 you have to do them faster still.I'll play a hard platformer like Meat Boy and love it even as I curse it, but I have zero interest in grinding away to shave off time-attack seconds. It's boring and tedious, and it's a shame, because the later levels look a lot more fun than the early ones.Cute art, though.			",197,85,3,16,14,3,28

												100 levels of platforming and baby throwing of cuteness. You play as a mother Pikachu thing that needs to get her babies out the door and then get out herself. To do this, you can pick them up, throw them to the left or right, jump, hit switches and so on. You can even put them down on switches or on door blocks so when you hit the switch, the door holds open. When thrown, the babies go across the screen until they hit something then they fall. That lets them be used to hit triggers from far away. When carrying a baby, you can't jump as high, nor can you fit through small gaps as you normally can when not carrying them. If one baby doesn't make it, then you merely restart the level with the quick restart button.Even if the music and art style weren't top notch, this would be a great puzzle game. Most every level is only a single screen and you will blow through 40+ levels before you reach a real challenge. Not every level is meant to be a challenge though. Some are very simple to show new techniques and others are just fun in general. Each completed level unlocks others, but you can go in order and just keep playing the next level. It adds to the flow of the game. The levels are quick, simple, engaging and rewarding; all with a dose of adorability. Each level has a par time and keeps track of your best time. In fact the game shows you your ghost when you replay levels that you have completed.Eventually, throwable rocks, adorable enemies, breakable blocks, crayon colored deadly traps and angled trampolines that change thrown baby directions get added to the mix. Throwing your babies into the adorable enemies is a way to stun them. Its a good way to keep amping up the challenge and diversity between level to level. Remember baby, mama loves you, no matter how much she throws you against the wall or into the face of a giant lizard.This game goes by quick, and to pad it out, there is a level editor, along with the ability to download countless other levels made by other users. There's a lot of engaging fun here, but it all goes by so quick and virtually effortless that it feels like there's no reason to come back. 5 minutes of play can complete 10 levels.

												Offspring Fling is the most fun I've ever had throwing babies. That's partially because I don't get to throw babies very often, but also because it does what it does quite well. Every puzzle game needs to make the most of whatever portion of the genre it carves out and this title does just that, forcing you to push your understanding and mastery of its mechanics to their limits. What it lacks in scale it more than makes up in heart and polish, which are often in short supply on the platforming side.I'm not sure what you play as in Offspring Fling, but whatever it is it's adorable and has tons of tiny adorable babies. Some damn dinosaur thing comes through and scatters them though, so you've got to help your bunny-mama-thing round up her childrens. This happens over a hundred levels that are mostly single-screen puzzles but pack plenty of tricks and traps into that space. Along the way you'll deal with deadly pits, switch blocks, monsters, and other hazards to complicate saving your little ones.The main mechanic of the game is throwing your kids around, unsurprisingly. Pressing down next to one of your tiny offspring hefts them over your head, and pressing C pitches them in a straight line either right or left. You have to get them and yourself to the exit and the easiest way to do that is to chuck them through the door, but of course it's never that simple. Holding a baby raises the height of your character, slows them down, and limits their jump, meaning that you have to strategize how you move them around and make the most of your throws. This is even more important in levels with three or four offspring to transport.Very quickly you'll start coming across levels where a simple obstruction like a one-block space or a slightly too-tall wall force you to come up with complex maneuvers to get past. They're clever puzzles, ones that appear simple but build difficulty outward as you keep running into little snags in your plans. The puzzles that introduce new gimmicks like pits and switches do an excellent job of easing you into dealing with them as well, so the overall difficulty curve is quite smooth. Be aware that much of the challenge in Offspring Fling is based on timing and reflexes, though. Some puzzles will require you to outrun enemies or traps, or catch a baby in mid-flight to prevent its heart-wrenching demise.With timing challenges come timers, and it's here that Offspring Fling allows you to go as hard as you want. Beating a level at all earns you a flower, needed to unlock further sets of levels. But each level also has a target time that requires an optimized solution and earns you an additional gold flower. Early on these will come easily but soon start to get away from you, forcing some brain-wracking to earn. And then, if you're a true offspring-flinger, you can go for the rainbow flowers which are only awarded for beating the level in the fastest time possible. These are absurdly hard to get on anything that isn't a tutorial level and sometimes require far more clever and less obvious solutions to reach.It's all wound up in an adorably fluffy package with some Yoshi's Island-style sketch graphics and pleasing sound design. Honestly between the sharp puzzles and charming aesthetic there's not much holding it back, aside from the lack of story depth. Be warned, though, I wasn't able to get it running on my Windows 10 system so you might have to pass it over if you're fully upgraded. Aside from that it's an easy sell to fans of puzzles, cute games, and throwing babies. And everyone likes at least ONE of those.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												This is one of those simple games that I cannot stop playing. It's just the right level of difficult: It may take a few tries to beat a level, but I'm not ripping my hair out with frustration. I'm also willing to replay levels immediately after completing them in order to get a better score because I feel capable of achieving the goal times; they aren't unrealistic amounts.The art style is simple and cute. It reminds me of pokemon and others bits of my childhood. When I'm not trying to cut down on my time, I like messing with the environment, mostly destroying dandelions. I feel like there should be an achievement for destroying x amount of dandelions. The first time I died, I laughed at the explosion animation; it was perfect. I also enjoy the sound effects.Overall, this a a perfect not-too-hard, not-too-easy game. I can keep track of time with the ""shadow"" of my previous play. The countdown doesn't start until I press a key, so I have time to strategize. I highly recommend this game.			",23,20,0,5,1,0,1

												100/100 Levels beaten#About 3 hours to completionA fun platformer revolving around picking up smaller characters and taking them to the exit. Levels are (mostly) single screen and quick.Pros- (So Far) Every level is challanging enough without seeming impossible. It does get a bit dicey on a handful of level though.- Level Editor- Charming art style.- Fun!Cons:- Crashed several times on loadup. Might be controller i had attached?- There are a few levels where you have to catch one of the kids in midair after a jump. This is made super akward in that you pick them up (normally) by pressing down and they didnt change this for these types of situations. So pretty jump, then a direction, and then down in mid-air, and then a direction or command while you are holding them. All in a few seconds. I managed, but it can get frustrating.

												Offspring Fling the best puzzle game I've ever played. It's not so hard that you spend weeks on one puzzle, but not so easy that you can breeze through. The game is cute and nice to look at--it gives off this wonderful timeless painted vibe. The difficulty curve is also incrediby well done. I never felt overwhelmed or suddenly stuck. I'd reccomend this to casual people like me who like feeling slightly accomplished after finishing basic puzzle. I'd also reccomend it to people who like to 100% extremely difficult games, because with the unlockable bonus levels and gold/dev times this game is ridiculously difficult to beat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Offspring Fling! is a short platforming game with 100 levels (took me ~3 hours to complete), where each level seems varied and the latter levels becoming more difficult. The goal is to find your babies (offspring) and fling them into the exit door while avoiding traps, enemies, and obstacles. The game offers additional hidden levels if you're able to beat all the levels under certain times (par time & developer's time) which becomes a huge challenge for those who seek it. For the casual gamers, this is a good short challenging platforming game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If there is one thing Offspring Fling has going for it, it's charm. A childlike sensibility embodies every aspect of the game, from the beautiful crayon aesthetic to the heartfelt premise of a mother that has somehow misplaced here extremely numerous children. The music also does a good job at setting it apart, mixing classic 8-Bit sounds with classical instruments to great effect.It's a shame then that the gameplay doesn't reach the same level, and in fact I found it rather dull and inconsistently challenging. This is mainly because of the jumping mechanics, which feel very much inspired by Nintendo's Kirby games (your character's appearance shares a striking similarity to him as well). They are simply too floaty and impressive for a game built so heavily around timing, and made some of the otherwise basic levels frustrating to complete. The spotty controller support didn't help, as anyone that has tried to play a platformer using a keyboard should understand.If you can get past the controls you'll find a lightweight, mostly enjoyable puzzle platformer that never quite reaches its full potential, and is best appreciated in bite sized sessions to combat its somewhat repetitive design. If you are looking for a more well rounded experience however, you will probably be better served elsewhere.			",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

												Sigh... if you're just going for clearing the game or getting all gold flowers, the game is, with the infuriating exception of level 30, fairly enjoyable as a mildly challenging puzzle platformer that balances puzzle and action well, though the final boss is a bit mediocre.But trying to go for diamond flowers... just isn't fun. The game's controls are too stiff and rigid to lend themselves well to speedrunning, where pressing a buttom a frame too early means you basically didn't press it at all, barely clipping a corner causes you to lose all horizontal momentum, and the dev times range from ""literally frame perfect"" to ""super easy because he took the wrong path"" and it's just, ugh. Not fun. I played 101-110 and tried for diamond flowers on the first 50 levels (did not get them all) but at that point I was just... out of patience for this game.On the basis of the main game alone I think I'd recommend it but I absolutely would not wish the diamond flower time challenges on my worst enemy, some of the most unfun platforming I've ever done.

												This game is really not worth the $7.99 asking price. You can breeze through the entire game in about 3 hours if you're going for a gold flower on each level and a few more minutes if you want to beat the 10 postgame levels.Apparently, there are 10 more levels you can unlock past that, but it requires beating the staff times for the initial 110 levels. And honestly, I don't think that would be worth the trouble. Wrestling with the game's slippery controls to get the initial 100 gold flowers was already infuriating.If you're looking for a difficult platformer with much tighter controls, I'd reccomend Super Meat Boy. And if you want a puzzle platformer with some more content, give Toki Tori a try. Really, anything but this game.			",38,13,0,12,2,0,4

Product received for free
												* I guess i'll add my opinion about level 101-120 since i just beat it today. My playtime: 32.9h (based on steam, 100% achievement)19h (based on steam, 100 blue/99 golden/99 rainbow flower)Comparing it to Angry Birds:Blue flower = 1 starGolden flower =  2 starsRainbow flower = 3 starsGrindy Achievement: No.Optional Achievement: Yes (5 achievements).Difficult Achievement: Yes (8 achievements. Seriously, this game is hard).Developer Response: No (last response is in 14 Nov 2015, but you'll get a response in around 24h if you email the dev).IntroOffspring Fling! is a difficult platformer game about throwing chickens. I said difficult because it's hard to collect the flowers and some levels will only be unlocked after you collect the flowers (and those levels are harder than the rest of the levels). Each level will take less than one minute, except level 100 because of the long ""cutscene"" (but you can do it in less than 1 minute). Your time in each level determines which flower you'll get. Although the blue and golden flower might be easy to get, you can't say the same to the rainbow flower. The rainbow flower, which also can be called as dev times because it's the dev's time herself, is quite insane. Not only you need to finish the levels quicker (even with a difference in just one millisecond), you also have to master some tricks to do it faster.I was planning to finish the game as soon as i get 100 golden flowers because i can't seem to get the rainbow flowers on the first few levels after several tries, but i ended up realizing that i can get them after doing a few levels. Some levels have more than one way to finish with; while some levels can be completed faster with an easier way, some levels can be completed faster with a harder way. Besides, you'll understand and master a few techniques as you play.GraphicsThe graphics in this game is very cute. If you like pixels, you'll definitely love this. The pixel art is very nice to see, although the main menu might be confusing because the icons are not common.MusicFor a difficult game where you need to hear the same music over and over, you'll need to have a great music which won't make the players tired listening to it and Offspring Fling! does a good job with it. Perhaps one of the reason i'm still playing the game despite of the difficulty is because of the awesome music.ControlsI have to say that the controls are terrible. Especially if you are aiming for the dev times. Even the cursor is very slow (luckily, you'll only need mouse in the menu). There are delays between actions: jumping, throwing, picking up chickens--all of them. You'll need to time them right to do it. Some tricks require you to do a combination between actions, and it's not as easy as you think. One example is jumping + picking up chicken trick, which will need some time to get used with. You'll be raging everytime on your first few hour because of the ""stupid controls"", but you'll get used to it. At the next few hours, you'll realize that the ""stupid controls"" are not the thing that you need to rage about, it's the ""seem-to-be-impossible-to-beat dev times"" instead.There are some design which you'll need to abuse to beat the dev times. You can actually jump a few seconds before falling on an edge, and you can actually flip a switch twice if you are fast enough. Although the second one won't be used that much, you'll have to abuse the first time a lot. There is even a level (level 44, uppercut), where people finish it with sick reaction time, as in.. jumping, picking up chicken, throwing, landing on an edge, jumping after you reach the edge, picking up the chicken (again), and throwing it in a split second. Luckily, the trick is not needed to beat the stage.My opinion about the last 20 levelsI was stuck in a level before because i didn't know that you can boost your speed while running in a small passage by banging the roof. Because of that, i have to stop playing the game for like 3 months before i start picking it up again. This makes me forgot most of the techniques, not to mention the slow down button (triggered with F12), which i usually used to play the levels, isn't working. I ended up thinking that it's impossible to beat the game, which just become possible today.After emailing the dev with a hope that she'll fix this ""bug"", i only got a response with no luck in recovering my slow down button. She can't seem to reproduce the issue and said that she'll give me a build which has different key binding for the slow down. It's been a week and i haven't heard more from her. Luckily, i have already learned to play the game without that button in a hard way. Just fyi, the button strangely worked today and i found out that i can't seem to parry with it.After playing the levels which are considered ""very hard"" by the others, i found out that those are true, especially during my ~3 months hiatus. I forgot most of the controls, resulting in doing trial and error for most levels until i somehow get used to it. Levels 101-110 will test your ability from the existing techniques, while level 111-120, the real hell, will introduce a new parry technique which have to be applied in a hard way. It'll be extremely hard if you didn't use the second character. However, i have to say that the last 20 levels (especially the last 10), doesn't feel the same way as the first 100 levels. Sure, the game is more difficult, but i feel like i have to do the same thing over and over until i do things right, not because i'm not fast enough. This bores me quickly, especially when you die right after you started. In the first 100 levels, i feel the ""one more level"" feeling as i finished the game. However, for the last 20 levels, i got the ""if i fail again, it's time to rest"" feel.After finishing all levels, i ended up knowing more technical things, like how you should parry when you are below the enemy (if you're curious, the answer is you don't, because you have to figure out whether you're in the left or right position from the enemy's center), how to press keys after free falling, and more.Well, this has become long, but tbh, aside from the satisfaction that i finally can get rid of this game and how lucky i am to finish this game, i don't really feel anything after finishing this game unlike how i did after i beat level 100.Pros:- 100+ levels- Technique-based (or luck based)- Short levels (less than 1 min)- 3 characters (2 unlockable characters)Cons:- Strict delay between actions- Requires to abuse a lot of ""techniques"" just to defeat the dev times- No in-game tutorial for the techniquesSummaryThis is a difficult platforming game. A casual gamer might be able to play it (by not caring with the time), but some levels and secrets can only be unlocked if you try very hard.Should you buy this game?Yes.If you are a hardcore gamer who like difficult games, this can be a challenge for you. I won't recommend it for casual gamers though, because you'll miss a lot of content. ",105,50,4,17,11,2,6

												Offspring Fling is a puzzle game, you play as this ungodly adorable fuzzball who has lost her children to some dinosaur thing and you must go save them while traversing puzzles and what not.  Styled after SNES games and unholy levels of difficulty you get to throw your very resiliant offspring around to take on enemys, finish puzzles and to get them to the exit.  You can stack them up and carry them, but it slows you down and you can't jump as high.  Though keep in mind, if you loose one of those adorable little fuzzball offspring thingys, it's game over, you go back and restart the level, so... it can get annoying at times.  Awesome game, support this developer!			",434,101,5,51,40,4,44

												I'm really not a fan of this game. It's a puzzle platformer in the vein of many many other puzzle platformers that have been released in the last 5 years, but doesn't have anything interesting to draw me in. I really don't find anything about Offspring Fling unique or interesting and can think of quite a few similar games that I'd rather play.Now, that's not to say it's not well made. From a technical standpoint, it seems solid. After trying it out for a short bit, there wasn't anything that kept me wanting to play. To be fair, I'm a bit burnt out on this genre these days, so people looking for a new puzzle platformer might really enjoy it.			",316,129,2,17,24,5,33

												If you ever sit at the computer, re-watching your favorite tv series, or chatting with your friends, and you need a game that will occupy you, but won't take all of your concentration, this is it.I used to play minesweeper or free-cell on days like that. Now I play Offspring Fling!It's a simple platformer, with numerous levels, puzzles, and a variety of obstacles. The goal? You are a small, furry creature, whose offspring (and a lot of it) got scattered all over. You need to find your babies, and transport them to safety (on your head, or by throwing them around). It's super cute, and the levels can get super difficult. It requires a lot of thinking and skill, and timing. But it's a small, simple game that you can pause at any second, so it doesn't take up your whole mind. I usually play it while skyping with someone, or chatting on facebook.Plus it's super duper cheap. Or at least it was, when I got it.The graphics are old school 16 bit. And there are OVER 100 levels. The soundtrack? As adorable as the game.So if you're looking for something small, simple, and fun to do while you're waiting for a video to buffer, or something. Go for it.			",248,100,3,28,11,0,15

												Amazing and overlooked platformer/puzzle game (heavily oriented on the execution rather than the puzzle solving). Great art and music too.Just beating the game is easy and takes roughly 2 hours, but that's only when the most interesting side of the game begins. Mastering all the movement techs and improving your times to unlock the late game content takes quite a bit of effort, and beating the last stages feels really rewarding. If you like games like Super Meat Boy, the completionist side of Offspring Fling! will definitely interest you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well this is certainly a cute game, but I feel like the creator(s) were fooling around during the development of this game when it comes to some of the technical aspects. No option to change resolution or set the game in full screen (I may be wrong). The game had stable performance at least, no crashes or bugs or glitches.Game play is simple, fling those offspring into doors, each level is pretty short and you don't have to play many of them to reach the ending, especially if you perform well. At most there are around 5 of those little guys (don't remember how big the largest level is) you have to throw around avoiding hazards. The graphics are cute, but are too derivative of something like Bubble Bobble and Kirby. The music is forgettable but appropriate for the game’s style.The game just doesn't stand out, as competent as it is crafted. The best part is completing a stage under time, it’s like eating a burger, satisfactory, just enough to keep you going to the next stage. The core mechanics don't necessarily change, nor do you acquire powers that change dramatically the flow of the game, so it's you having to better your skills as you progress, a style of play I like.The game would’ve been stronger if the levels somewhat longer, more distinct, and more dangerous, forcing the player’s attention more. Concentrating on beating times makes sense with the current design of the game fortunately, but I feel it may have limited the potential the game had.I find myself lukewarm towards the game, played it, completed it, forgot about it and that's the biggest sin a game can commit in my opinion.(Any mistakes in my text may be attributed to the fact that English is not my first language, sorry if it makes this review hard to read)			",210,56,0,23,21,2,41

												Buy? Maybe. It's a speed run platformer clearly inspired buy Yoshi's Island and the SNES era. Beautiful graphics and a charming soundtrack. This game is mostly intended for hardcore speed run fans, as some of the par time requirements are outrageous and require flawless precision, which feels impossible when the buttons to pick up children and throw them are mapped to seperate keys that can't be combined. If pickup/throw was on the same key, my timing would be much better. You will restart levels frequently for par times - the devs knew this by making a key instantly restart the level. My problem is I feel like I'm constantly restarting (for par times) due to missed landings, imperfect jumps, and the damn config issue. I'm not sure if the problem is me, the game, or my controller. Otherwise, the game is rock solid, has a level editor, and still good as a platformer, but it isn't for me.			",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												Well, this game is by far one of the best games I've ever bought. First of all, even though it's cute, it's pretty difficult, what makes the game last for a long time. But, because of this, you'll need to be patient. There's a lot of levels to play, with 3 different grades defined by the time you spent to beat the level (blue = normal time; gold = good time; rainbow = excelent time).It may look simple, but it's not. There are some techniques that are necessary to learn in order to beat some levels.Although it's very hard, it's still very fun! And it's not that expensive, what makes it even better.Do you like cuteness? Do you have the money? BUY IT! 100/10			",93,22,0,13,3,0,9

												Gameplay is very simple. You control mother pikachu (lol?) to collect her off springs from all around the corner. Jump and throw them around back to the collection point 'door'. You also need to time your completion - as the score is based on how fast you can do to complete a level. A level can be done repeatedly to ensure you get a better score.Personal opinion: I do enjoy platformers, and I have many games in this genre beaten - but for some reason the whole set of the game doesn't appeal me at all. Maybe because the puzzle focus isn't as dynamic as Adventures of Shuggy for example. Shuggy has many puzzle elements that keep me interested.			",1570,616,62,187,177,20,271

												It's cute in its own way, but gradually gets difficult. Nothing like thrownig your own child around to solve a puzzle though! If only you could in real life...In your first playthrough, don't worry or stress over the timer. I wish there was a way to turn if off so it wouldn't be so distracting or hovering over you. This game is more for speed runners and expert platformers, but can be good for casual play too. Controls may be a bit tricky to adjust to, but eventually you'll get the hang of them and learn some techniques.Only way to exit the game is to Alt+F4 or click on the X on the window frame, minor issue I have with it.For some of the levels may need to find a walkthrough of how to finish it, whether normally or speedrun route.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Offspring Fling is about a Pols Voice who looses its little ghostlets and tries its hardest to avoid the loud noises of gamers blowing into their controllers in attempts to kill them. Dragons and♥♥♥♥♥♥are in here, but whatever, you just want to kill these little ghosts...DON'T YOU!?			",225,24,8,30,11,1,26

												Cant say I enjoyed this. Its a simple puzzler where the challenge is always a timer that requires a later unlock to complete. The controls are not responsive enough for a race against time system. Xbox controller was not as good as advertised.I couldn't get beyond this flaw, despite some encounters that were interesting, I rarely enjoyed it.I beat the game asap with the keyboard. Will achievement hunt it to a perfect game and then uninstall. I liked the soundtrack. Air direction was simple but does not bother me.			",674,170,29,114,120,3,131

												Playing through the game is simple enough, but if you're up for that extra challenge, the game includes the developers' times to compete against. When all's said and done, you have a clever puzzle-platformer with a cute artstyle that offers the perfect amount of difficulty for anyone who is a fan of the genre. Definitely worth picking up!

The only downside I saw was when you try to go for the best times in the game.  You have to race against the dev(s) on their own ghost, and they exploit their game's own minor bugs.  Definitely worth a few bucks if you can grab this game if you enjoy a fun platformer, but doesn't warrant a lot of game time/replay value, so beware in that sense.			",228,26,6,20,13,0,16

If you finnished over the par time you get a blue star or if you get par or under you get a golden flower. If you choose to replay the leavel you get to see a gost image of yourseld from the last play through you did to help better and improve yourself.If you got a gold star you see a gost image of the dev playing the leavel. The deve has a time lower then the par time but i dont know if something special happens if you pet the devs time because i havent been able to do it it.I have only played it at this stage on the keyboard and the controlls fell a bit slugish so you are proble better off using a controller but i cant confrem that.The menu is basic and apart from the level selection the it doesnt explain that well what the other selections are so it is trail and error. The option menu is basic and nnot much to speak of although it doent need much but would be nice if there was diffrent resuloution options.Over all it is fub and enjoubale and at times addictive.

												A really enjoyable game! The game reminds of all the retro arcade games one used to play in the childhood. To be honerst, the only reason that I started palying it was to earn trading cards. But the more I played it, the more I fell in love with it. The game isn't very difficult, even though level 82 is a real challenge (still haven't completed it), but the levels diversion makes it funny and a longlasting joy! The game ""only"" contains 100 levelse as far as I know, but the game has a hugely replayable. The game has only a 6,99€ pricetag, so consider buying it and have fun:)			",236,31,5,16,12,3,22

												Well I sure never really even looked at any image related to this thing, the name itself didn't catch onto me until I played it for the trading cards.Then I saw what a cute puzzle game it is.You are playing as the mother whose offspring must be saved. That's the simple premise!The controls are very responsive and the jump button especially in regard to how hard you press that jump button.The goal is simple:  Bring your offspring into the exit along with yourself. This sounds simple at first, but several entities are required to take into mind, and here's a few of them.Mother Fling (That's what I'll call her now) gets a bigger ""hitbox"" the more offspring she carries(You can't pass through narrow spaces), she becomes slower and finally also jumps lower.Finally, you can 'fling' your offspring. This means tossing them straight ahead of you. This is what you'll be doing a lot, for most of the time you cannot simply carry your cute children to home sweet home.Time to mention the story as I get on to obstacles: Various creatures are out to harm your beloved small offspring. One in particular seemed to just scatter them all over the place, a big mean one.While it may not kill you, if a single off-spring is eaten alive or dies by the terrain such as drowning, you lose and must restart the level.I should mention that I like the animation on Mother Fling if her offspring dies, she holds her face like she's about to cry from seeing her children dying. Mother Fling must also survive, remember that. Even if all of your offspring have been thrown into safety, if you die at that point, you're back to square one.The music in the game is nice! It's good to hear game soundtracks that doesn't make you want to mute the game instantly.The sound effects? Neato.In conclusion; a cute puzzle game that's worth paying the cheap price.If there's a sale on this game, it's basically a steal.			",161,35,0,12,10,2,10

This is a solid platformer.There's nothing much to say more than that, really. Offspring Fling is about clearing relatively small levels, with numerous puzzles within each one, as fast as you can -- while using your ""young"" as objects to be carried to the exist, and to fling them across the level to operate levers and trigger-weights. The speed and movement is solid, the controls are responsive for the most part, and the game isn't as linear in solving the levels as one might think. It suprisingly has a bit of depth to it.Now, the depth of the game first shows itself with the dev's 'ghost', the recording of how the dev beat the level so quickly, in basically that... It cheats. It uses exploits in the game, to clear the game faster, like jumping constantly within a corridor with a short ceiling, to cut the animation short which boost's one speed a bit. And that's not the only exploit there is, although I haven't found any more than 2.The game becomes more interesting that way, it builds a form of 'special techniques' that allows you to play in a specialized manner. And unlike, say, Dustforce, it's pretty easy to learn how to use them.I like this game, it's concise and simple, yet with enough depth to make you play the entire game more than once.

												Fun little platformer. There's about 100 levels and some can be a bit challenging. Enemies are introduced halfway into the game and they can make things frantic. There's a bronze,silver, gold-type medal system for each level. You get a blue flower is you complete the level, gold if you complete it under a certain time, and rainbow-colored if you beat the dev time. I gave up on the dev time because I couldn't even beat the first level.			",1462,576,56,152,171,14,223

												Well, I was rather enjoying solving the puzzles until they threw enemies in. That kind of killed my groove. It's a cute puzzle platformer with pretty good level design. It introduces a new mechanic every several levels, and they combine together well to do some neat things. The learning curve and pacing are reasonable, and I like the music too. Dealing with those frickin' wasps just changed the feel of things enough that I wasn't having enough fun anymore to finish the rest of it, but it was fun while it lasted.			",499,202,15,84,46,6,86

												Offspring Fling! is a puzzle platformer and plays a bit like Mario vs Donkey Kong. Most puzzle are a bit too easy. The art style is quite good with it's cuteness. But the music get annoying and the game could use some anti aliasing. The controller support doesn't recognizes the d-pad and anolog stick of the xbox controller. There also isn't cloud save support. Which is kinda annoying. All in all it's an average puzzle platformer that doesn't come near the greatness of masterpieces in the genre like Donkey Kong '94.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most boring game I have ever played in my entire life.Puzzles are simple...too simple. The soundtrack is annoying and largely uninspired, consisting of 4-5 second loops.Grinding away to get better times is the only way to unlock every level. It'd be more enjoyable if the levels that are readily available were pleasant in the least.Some of the puzzles are frustrating, but not enjoyably so. They just irritate you when the game decides it wants to try to be hard, but fails spectacuarly with unfair timing that you largely have no control over.All in all, a waste of 8 bucks, and it'd be a waste of 10 cents if it was ever on sale for that much.

												Charmingly executed, and appreciably shy of repeating itself across its 100 levels. The difficulty is restrained, falling far short of what it might have been, with no puzzle requiring especially complex execution. Two speed run goals in each stage up the ante for those seeking a challenge, and a separate level editor can provide access to new challenges from the community. Excellent for younger gamers, but still enjoyable for older, more seasoned players.			",901,303,36,137,92,12,183

												Offspring Fling has brought many nice surprises to me, starting from the first moments I played it.  It's a puzzle-platformer with adorable visuals, smart gameplay, and challenging puzzles, all without deterring the casual experience.I bought this game with a Humble Bundle, mostly because I wanted some the more expensive deals I would get from buying the bundle, and there Offspring Fling sat in my library, uninstalled, until those goshdarn trading cards showed up, encouraging me to give it a shot.  It was during the opening credits that I suddenly noticed: this game was made by Kyle Pulver!  This isn't the first Kyle Pulver game I've played, and I think I'm going to start paying more attention to the guy.  He first caught my attention back in high school as I was looking for tips on how to create my own indie games.  I stumbled upon one of his other games called BONESAW and said to myself ""yes, this guy gets it.""  The controls were intuitive and fun, the story was minimalistic, and the gameplay, while reminding me retro beat-em-ups like Double Dragon, blew them all out of the water!Now, I can safely say that Kyle Pulver hasn't lost his touch.  The game is adorable with its visuals, and brutal in its gameplay.  The puzzles are that special kind of retro-challenging, but the controls are spot on and never frustrating.  To 100% the game is a gaming challenge equal to that of some of gamings greatest achievements, and recommended only to completely insane individuals (like myself).  It's the kind of unique experience that reminds you of a simpler time in gaming, where gameplay innovation and a solid setting were enough to make you undergo the toughest challenges you've ever faced.  Great work, Mr. Pulver!			",272,94,3,15,13,2,14

												This is a babby throwing simulator where you go and throw babbies around and get them into the goal.The game itself is pretty cool, althpugh frustrating at some points as it sometimes relies on twitch reactions which may or may not be a good thing for some people.It also looks and sounds rather pretty with the artstyle somehow reminding me of a mashup of Yoshi's Island and Super Meat Boy.If you like throwing little babbies around, get this. If you don't like throwing babbies around, then don't get this.			",262,65,6,40,20,3,35

												Another short but sweet indie title by an unheard of developer. Offspring Fling is a game based on SNES style and it shows in the graphics and the game play. Story is simple: children gone and mother need to rescue them. She does this by throwing, placing and carrying them till they all reach the cave. So essentially this is a puzzle platformer and honestly it’s pretty good. There are about 100 levels and each level has a gold time and a devi time for the time attack people. The core game play is fun and is always throwing new game play mechanics every 5-10 levels.  I only wish there was more of the game with the completion of the game (without the perfect time mode) clocking in at 3-4 hours. But its a cheap game and so much fun flinging offspring on a rainy day.			",555,218,17,74,16,7,52

												Easily the best game for speed-run enthusiests I've seen. Levels have very precice and well-done platforming design; each level has a ""Gold time"" that gives you an extra credit towards unlocking new levels. Each level can be repeated instantaneously at any moment with the press of a button (gamepad-accessible). After unlocking the ""Gold time"" you unlock the ""Dev Time"" which shows you how fast the Developer beat the level and even gives you a Ghost of the developer beating the level - as well as giving you ghosts of your own past attempts at the level so you can constantly see where you are constantly doing better or worse than your last attempt to make micro-improvements to your runs. A speed-runners dream. Also extremely cute, retro-beautiful, and has wonderful music.			",311,113,4,47,13,3,37

												The name and trailer deceived me in a good way, this turned out to be quite the challenging little game. My only issue with it is that over half the achievements seem to require you to beat the dev times on the original 100 levels which sometimes requires near frame perfect execution. Other than that though, I have greatly enjoyed the challenge that the game has provided in first solving the various puzzles, and then the added challenge of finding a fast way to solve them.

												A fantastic platformer filled with charm, replayability and some dead-hard time challenges. You must navigate your little yellow Pika babies to safety (by throwing them violently across the world) and then get there yourself. A plethora of enemies, switches and hazardous ooze stand in your way.The first so many levels introduce you to the game quite comfortably, but the difficulty soon ramps up. Or rather, not the actual difficulty of completing levels, but the satisfaction of completing levels FAST and attaining Gold and Rainbow flowers.In truth, almost all of the levels are fairly easy to complete, but the true underlying challenge here is to complete each level in a quick time, which earns you a Gold flower. If you complete the level faster than the time the developer set, you earn a juicy and illustrious Rainbow flower. However, almost ALL of the rainbow flowers are very difficult to earn. Patience, some key tricks you can perform which you will need to learn and master, and downright skill are needed to rack up all 110 Rainbow flowers.If you are a fan of puzzle-platforming and have some keen quick reflexes, this is the perfect game!The graphics and music are suitably charming, and service the game perfectly!

												Rating: Above AverageOffspring Fling's art style is charming and a pleasure to experience.  It also has pretty relaxing and nice music tracks, but would greatly benefit from a bit more variety  in conjunction with fewer repeated uses. The controls are decent, but it can start to hurt if you play for long amounts of time due to the layout on keyboard and some gamepads have issues, so smaller chunks of gameplay are recommended.This game will be fricking intense (nearly frame perfect accuracy, rethinking of conventional mechanics, and lots of split second failures) if you want to see the unlockable levels and earn higher ranks.  If you're looking for a difficult platformer  mixed with some puzzling, look no further.  On the other hand, the gap between the time-based ranks is sizable and may not be worth the required mastery and time, but the regular difficulty is still  enjoyable.     People who will truly love Offspring Fling: speedrunners and difficult game enthusiasts.   People who will probably like it quite a bit: puzzle fans, average players,  and fans of games done with retro sensibilities. Check it out some time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very clever puzzle/platformer where you throw babies. No, really. you need to get them all to the goal in each stage, and the only way to do that involves a lot of baby tossing. Suprisingly, this manages to be more cute than horrifying. Speaking of stages There's a good 100 stages to play through, with times to beat on each one, and a level editor on top of that, so you'll get a lot for what it costs. Worth looking into.

Its cute, I suppose.  The puzzle are sometimes a little tricky but it's nothing really snagging like a Portal and its aesthetic is not enough to keep me like a Critter Crunch or a Clikr.  There's no alternate play modes, so you kind of just get what you see.Can't really reccomend much, so don't get it unless a standard puzzle platformer with a better-than-generic aesthetic is what you want.

												This game is freaking adorable but don't let the cute fluff fool you, if you're like me and have trouble resisting a challenge then this game is more fiendish than it looks.It's a pretty fun little puzzle platformer where you play as a mother trying to find and then carry or hurl her babies to safety .. (she THROWS them .. to safety .... let's let that sink in .. moving on). It isn't terribly hard if all you want to do is get through it .. but .. beware .. it will show you that you could have done the level faster and ask if you want to try again .. do you dare? If you succeed .. it will challenge you to beat the creator at his own game .. so you'll try that ..And suddenly a cute little platformer becomes something fiendishly evil that keeps you trying every level over and over to get the fastest time for completion you possibly can. I'd definitely recommend this if you do some research on it and think you'll like this game. I certainly do. It kind of reminds me of the old Krusty's Fun House .. I mean, he wanted to kill the rats .. you wanna save this mother's babies but the combinaton of platformer + puzzle  .. is what I'm getting at here.I got this as a bundle, so looking at the price .. $7.99 strike me as a buck or two steep but .. this game is worth it, I think. The creator did a great job with it, he deserves our continued support. So here's my support in the form of a positive review. I'm doing my part .. will you do yours?			",52,8,0,12,0,2,5

												One of my favorite puzzle-platformers of all time. Whenever I start playing it again, I just can't stop. The music is beautiful, very reminscent of Hisaishi's compositions. There is a lot of speed tech which make running through levels quickly very easy, so long as you can execute the maneuvers in time. Offspring Fling as really high replay value, and I'm certain I'll be coming back to it again and again.			",628,106,6,74,30,2,35

												Its a decent time suck for a while.  I found some of the puzzles to be fun, some to be easy, and one to be impossible.  From what I understand, a trick jump becomes a requirement of a couple levels, and this is the first one.  Uppercut.  I spent about...3 hours on it.  So the game is fun, but it might make you break a controller.  For me, I'm just done with it.  Trick jumps that are impossible to pull off dont seem to be fun.  Especially since it doesnt really help you understand that a trick jump is needed. ",179,43,1,32,9,5,27

												Puzzle-platformingOffspring Fling is a puzzle- plaftforming game released in 2012 by Kyle Pulver.The plot serves as justification for the gameplay. You play as a mother (of forest creatures resembling a certain pokemon) who has lost all of her children after a monster attack. The mother now has to search the woods and retrieve all of her lost children.Gameplay is a mainly puzzle solving with some platforming elements. There are various levels (over 100). At the start of each one you will see where you (the mother), the children, exit, buttons and monsters are located on the screen. In order to win each level, you need to collect all the children and deliver them to the exit, which is done by walking up to the children and pick up each one and then either, drop, shoot or carry them to the door. For each child you pick up, your weight increases, which decreases your jump height.The puzzle element comes into play when you have to figure out how to reach the all the children, which are trapped behind barriers or hard to reach places. Puzzles are generally solved by dropping your children on buttons (to remove barriers and decrease weight) which will allow you to reach the other kids. There are also traps and monsters which will kill you and the children. Should you or any child die, the level immediately ends and you have to restart. You and your children have only 1 life and no health, so anything dangerous will kill you instantlly.There is also a timer which only starts when you move your character, allowing you time to plan out your movements beforehand. In order to unlock new levels you need to beat the recorded time for the level.Audio is quite nice. The back ground music is cheerful and suits this game well. There is no voice acting. The sound FX for jumping and finishing a level sound similar to 'Mario' games.Levels are quite unique, with the placements of children, obstacles and the mother, no levels look or feel the same.Graphics are decent. The colours and 2D artstyle present a cheerful atmosphere.If you are looking for a puzzle game with some plaftfroming, this game will not dissapoint.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Offspring Fling is a casual 2D game that consists of competing with yourself to beat a level quickly. It takes a lot of tries, but once I get that great time and that golden flower I feel extremely satisfied and proud. If you're a casual gamer but like a bit of a challenge, you should take a look at Offspring Fling.The music was the first thing that took me, its beautifully simple and immersive. The only problem I had with it was the fact that it loops the same song and it can get repetitive. The plot of the game was introduced with pictures rather than words, which fits the game's style well. The controls are what make this timed platformer up, at first they feel unnatural and forced, but if you focus on where your character is at all times you start to adapt to them. The game's nature is simple yet competitive, you try to score a better time than a replay of yourself, that's it. The graphics are a unique simplistic 2D that also fits this game's theme perfectly, however it would help to make this platformer's graphics sharper from a gameplay perspective. The gameplay is fun for a while, but being that the game sticks with the same concepts for long periods of time make it tedious replaying the same thing over and over striving for the best score.Offspring fling does very well at what it's shooting for, however if the devs would have introduced more game mechanics at a quicker rate, the game would be much better. The controls could be smoothed, and some new music would be well deserved. My overall score of this game is a 6.5/10, slightly above average.			",228,105,17,36,27,2,28

												While it may look like any other game trying to cash in on nostalgia and the whole 'retro' feeling, it's a very solid puzzle platformer that is relatively easy to finish but has some hard and then some insanely difficult time trials if you're wanting a challenge. The soundtrack is great and the game never really got stale over the course of the 100 main levels. It'll probably take just over an hour to finish the game without going for time trials.

The length of the game is its major shortcoming; even those who take their time with levels may complete all puzzles in a couple hours. Time challenges could potentially double your playtime. In short, worth playing but perhaps not to all for full price. If you're even mildly interested, be sure pick it up when it's on sale; you won't regret it!			",125,46,3,15,10,0,21

												Offspring Fling has brought many nice surprises to me, starting from the first moments I played it.  It's a puzzle-platformer with adorable visuals, smart gameplay, and challenging puzzles, all without deterring the casual experience.I bought this game with a Humble Bundle, mostly because I wanted some the more expensive deals I would get from buying the bundle, and there Offspring Fling sat in my library, uninstalled, until those goshdarn trading cards showed up, encouraging me to give it a shot.  It was during the opening credits that I suddenly noticed: this game was made by Kyle Pulver!  This isn't the first Kyle Pulver game I've played, and I think I'm going to start paying more attention to the guy.  He first caught my attention back in high school as I was looking for tips on how to create my own indie games.  I stumbled upon one of his other games called BONESAW and said to myself ""yes, this guy gets it.""  The controls were intuitive and fun, the story was minimalistic, and the gameplay, while reminding me retro beat-em-ups like Double Dragon, blew them all out of the water!Now, I can safely say that Kyle Pulver hasn't lost his touch.  The game is adorable with its visuals, and brutal in its gameplay.  The puzzles are that special kind of retro-challenging, but the controls are spot on and never frustrating.  To 100% the game is a gaming challenge equal to that of some of gamings greatest achievements, and recommended only to completely insane individuals (like myself).  It's the kind of unique experience that reminds you of a simpler time in gaming, where gameplay innovation and a solid setting were enough to make you undergo the toughest challenges you've ever faced.  Great work, Mr. Pulver!			",272,94,3,15,13,2,14

												Offspring Fling is a game is about throwing babies. Who'd have guessed, right?This is a good game if you like platforming and timing-based puzzle games. In the short amount of time that I spent with it, the puzzles/challenges seemed pretty good. I somehow ended up with the soundtrack through some music or humble bundle, and having listened to it both in and out of game, I can say that the music is superb.I did not spend a lot of time playing this game, though. Other games were able to easily distract me away from getting too far into this, so the reliability of my review should be taken with a grain of salt. That may speak to the staying power of this game, however I'm still convinced I'll come back to this at a future point in time.For what I played, the mechanics of stacking babies on your head leading to a larger hitbox and such seemed to be utilized really well, and did lead to some really interesting puzzles with ideas I hadn't seen before in other games. 4 out of 5 foxes.

												Charmingly executed, and appreciably shy of repeating itself across its 100 levels. The difficulty is restrained, falling far short of what it might have been, with no puzzle requiring especially complex execution. Two speed run goals in each stage up the ante for those seeking a challenge, and a separate level editor can provide access to new challenges from the community. Excellent for younger gamers, but still enjoyable for older, more seasoned players.			",901,303,36,137,92,12,183

												Consider this a great, decades-lost SNES puzzle platformer. The presentation is 1993 perfect, the ""dev time"" speed-runs on every level are absolutely brutal, and the feel could only be improved if the 360 controller's D-Pad was supported. This game isn't as tough as Super Meat Boy, where simple level progression is far from guaranteed, but it's no slouch--a little too tough for me to want to cheev out. It'll have to languish at 43.3% completion until I deserve more punishment.			",446,284,15,83,66,3,112

												This is a good 16 bit style puzzle game, the controls work and there are some real challenges and a good amount of playtime here.The art style really works and gives the game a lot of charm.			",440,91,6,81,46,2,87

												The name and trailer deceived me in a good way, this turned out to be quite the challenging little game. My only issue with it is that over half the achievements seem to require you to beat the dev times on the original 100 levels which sometimes requires near frame perfect execution. Other than that though, I have greatly enjoyed the challenge that the game has provided in first solving the various puzzles, and then the added challenge of finding a fast way to solve them.

												In terms of puzzle design quality, Offspring Fling is almost on par with top pure platformers such as Super Meat Boy. On every level, there's a simple puzzle and there are 2 times that you try to beat, one of which requires absolute perfect play. But the fact that its controls are nowhere near smooth as one, its capaticy to frustrate you is tenfold.Still, if you love this type of platformers, this is really worth a look if only for the awesome level designs.

												I wouldn't say this is anything extraordinarily innovative, but it's a really solid puzzle platformer.  It's got a pretty smooth learning curve if you want to play it casually, but the awesome part is that you can use hidden game mechanics you're never directly taught to speedrun the game and unlock additional game content.  Definitely worth a look if you want a cute puzzle-platformer.			",414,159,7,71,47,5,65

												It's a neat little puzzle platformer that has an easy going difficulty ramp up.  It's easy to understand and play.  I probably wont go back to it, but it's a solid choice for fans of the genre.			",788,363,15,120,66,12,91

												Very cute puzzle game. Levels are very neatly designed to instruct us on new concepts and progressively increase in difficulty. Every new device starts very easy for learning and in 2 or 3 levels I had to stop for a few moments before playing just to analyze the level.The artwork is also very nicely done. The Japanese art style is in itself very good to look at, but there are weather and flora elements that are there just to add a subtle touch, which are most welcome.Very engaging, great tutorials while still challenging, and good aesthetics. Definitely recommended.			",499,77,5,60,15,4,30

												There are some games that come to you, you install them, open them, play them for a while, and you don't know why but nothing about it is cool or enjoyable.That was my case with this game... I can't seem to like ANYTHING about it. After 0.5 hours of playing it and 2 hours of letting it open to take the cards, is now in my ""Hidden"" steam library list.			",201,31,4,8,11,2,12
