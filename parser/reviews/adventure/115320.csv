 PROTOTYPE 2 – REVIEW    Graphics (Environment 8/10, Models 7/10) 7.5   Animations 6/10   Sound 7/10   Music 7/10   Story 6/10   Gameplay 7.5/10   Inovation 7/10   TOTAL SCORE 7  GraphicsOn the first sight on all settings maxed this game looks pretty nice, but after a couple of hours of gameplay the 'holes' of this game are starting to show ... but, sadly, not just in the graphics area.  AnimationsThe animations in this game are really disappointing, with bosses which have the same attack animations, people, enemies and soldiers that are just copies one of another. I think that Heller's animations are a small variety in a such 'copy-pasted' world.  Sound & MusicThe voice acting and other sounds in this game were not really impressive but neither that bad at all. StoryThe story of your character, James Heller, the war veteran who's been intentionally made into the one of the evolved by Alex Mercer seemed not that good at all. Actually there were some missions that had some kind of cleverness and some elements that looked promising, but sadly just for a short period of time, because they just sank in the sea of other unimaginative and boring missions - with just one goal: to clear all of the Mercer's companions and Mercer himself. End of story. Maybe the memory cut-scenes with which you progress in understading of the story and other side tasks and missions are the 'better part' and enjoyment of the whole game, not just the story. GameplayThe gameplay beside the graphics thankfully isn't the weakest part of the game and seemed improved since the first game. Running, jumping and gliding trough the map which is divided into three sectors never gets old. There are plenty upgrades to unlock, side missions to complete and other bonuses to finish, which really extends the time of finishing the game. Maybe the main problem is the fact, that you are overpowered to the most of the enemies - that's why deaths seem to happen only by an accident and not because of the 'difficulty' of the game.There isn't really much to do in the so called 'open world' beside completing the tasks that you are given. Using your abilities to beat or  'punish' other NPC's in a free roam mode gets quickly boring, because of their dull personality and poor mechanics. ConslusionPrototype 2 could be so much more of what it is, beacuse it inherited such a promising name and some in-game elements that showed the possibilities that could turned this game into a one of a kind gaming experience. But, unfortunately, because of so many unimaginative and (rather) bad shortcuts the overall feeling of this game just falls apart.Maybe there are reasons why is that and why we just can't give this game a score above mediocrity and put it on a shelf with other great and impressive titles.Replay value: NOT really.Recommended: Yes, but ONLY ON SALE!

												Alright.I completed Prototype 2 less than 5 minutes ago, and Prototype 1, I've played probably more than 200 hours in total.Are they the same experience? NO. With a change of protagonist and a complete revamp of the abilities, upgrade system, and fighting mechanics, Prototype 1 and PRototype 2 are two very different (and both incredible) experiences.The Abilities.Instead of one ability equipped at a time, with a multitide of combos and attacks, P2 features 2 abilities assigned to Mouse Button 1 and 2. This makes combat simpler than P1, but not nessecarily better. P1 contains thousands of combinations to simply desecrate your enemies. P2 has much gorier attacks, special moves, and kill sequences, but P1 simply goes more in depth. If you wanna know more, play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.Upgrade System.Prototype 1 had a currency based upgrade system in which you would collect EP (Evolution Points) in ludicrous amounts and spend them on upgrades, of which there were, I believe, over 100. Prototype 2 features a leveling system, in which the EP (still present) acts as experience points. Upon leveling, the player chooses a single upgrade. Whether either one is better, I can't say, because I didn't have a problem with either of them. They were acceptable mechanics that did what they were meant to. Can you really ask for more?Fighting Mechanics.Incredible. Please just play it. It's Incredible.Story.In my opinion, P2's story was FAR better than P1. The original Prototype has more of a focus on the hack and slash, kill everything, be a total badass through ACTIONS. P2, on the other hand, has more of an emotional story, in which the character (still badass, still ♥♥♥♥s♥♥♥♥♥♥up) is less cold, and is more emotional. I felt more immersed with Heller than with Mercer.Final ThoughtsIf you can spare the funds, ♥♥♥♥ING BUY IT. If you can't, you better start a damn trust fund, because both Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 are excellent, amazing games that give 2 amazing experiences.SPOILER ALERTThe protagonist is black. Not once did I hear any sort of mention that he was black, nor did I hear a racial slur at any point. Nice. That's the way to go.RatingSure ok m8 i r8 8/8			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TUTORIAL - How to fix unplayable framerate issues with the recent ATI/AMD graphic drivers!! 
A Guide for PROTOTYPE 2
By: Tiv1L.

			So I'm pretty sure many of you guys out there using ATI cards are having problems with this game but don't worry, I've found a solution that should fix it.		


1. Need disable Catalyst A.I. in the settings of videodriver, or make the following:- Press Win+R;- Write: 'regedit' and press Enter;- Find folder ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ Class \ {4D36E968-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} \ 0000 (or 0001) \UMD\"";- Change ""CatalystAI"" key value: 31 (or 32) to 30, then change CatalystAI_DEF key value to 0.SIGNED, DUDE WHO PLAYED IT BEFORE AMD DRIVERS BROKE			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I rather enjoyed the first Prototype game. It had its fair share of flaws, but few games let me feel as gosh-darn powerful. I could leap tall buildings in a single bound, bash a tank to pieces, run through a crowd of zombies leaving bloody chunks in my wake... what's not to love? So despite the mediocre reviews the sequel received, it was a no-brainer that game would end up in my library as well. And you know what? I'm glad it did. Like the original, it's not perfect but it's a fun - if gory - superhero fantasy adventure (or maybe super-villain). The developers went with a more traditional method of storytelling (although they did go a bit heavy on the cut-scenes. but fortunately they are all skippable) and by the last third of the game the adventure does become somewhat repetitive. But the powers are still great and the controls have been streamlined since the original iteration, so it's even easier to become a weapon of mass devastation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I strongly suggest not purchasing Prototype 2. Yes, it was fun. Yes, it was marginally well-designed. But over-all, the first one was much, much better. I'll explain why, and you can decide for yourself if my issues are overriding factors for you:1. GraphicsPrototype 2 wins. I'll give it that. It's gorgeous. Poorly optimised, so you're gonna get a crap framerate, but it's gorgeous.2. Control schemePrototype 1 takes the gold there. P1's controls are well-mapped by default and make sense once you become aquainted with them. P2 changes some core controls for no reason, and because of the way they're set up, rebinding them will not help.3. Movement and parkour systemsP1 wins, but mostly because of the control setup. It just flows better, not only because it's been designed better, but also because the controls don't appear to have been designed for a race of crab people.4. GameplayP1 and P2 are actually somewhat tied gameplay-wise. P1's open-world is far more enjoyable and feels more ""alive."" Things do NOT despawn. I don't mean like they don't despawn for a long time, I mean they DO NOT. I once, to test it, hijacked a helicopter and left it on a roof down on the south end of the map. I then spent an hour or so screwing around in the north end of the map. I then returned and found my chopper in the exact state I had left it, ready for me to board. NPCs react semi-realistically. Civillians will run in fear and panic if they see you changing state, military personell can be fooled enjoyably with shape-shifting, and overall the NPC life feels ""alive.""P2 wins in events and missions. P1 ultimately has the story missions and that's it. There are side-missions but they're boring as hell and are repetitive, with no real incentive to play them. Granted, it makes up for it by having an enjoyable open-world to explore, but it fails to encourage playing the events. P2, however, has better mission design, even if it does get a little repetitive, and incentive is given in the form of power upgrades to play through the side-missions. Things despawn BADLY. I found two NPCs sitting on some chairs and rotated the camera. When it was turned back, they were completely different races and genders. Vehicles left lying around will disappear as soon as your field of view is broken by buildings.NPCs have slightly better animations but don't react well. Fooling military personell feels like I'm playing hide-and-seek with a babysitter. ""Where's the horrifying shapeshifting abominaattiooooonn? I can't fiiiiind hiiiim. Is he heeeere? How about in heeeere?"" It just gets old quickly.5. StoryP1's story is far, far superior, and not just because P2 suffers from sequelitis. P1's story is about a man put in confusing circumstances finding out his horrifying past and learning to live with it while being targetted by a shadow mega-corporation that has accidentally caused the destruction of New York. P2's story is about a man finding out his just-for-heart-string-tugging family has been murdered going up against a Saturday morning cartoon villain. To make it worse, P2's main villain is the protagonist of P1, the man you've come to be attached to, and ultimately see as a hero, despite the horrors he's been forced to commit. It feels like a cheap twist placed in for no particular reason other than the writers needing a way to not make you the P1 protagonist again.6. Overall experienceI enjoyed Prototype 2 but only in a very brief sense, about as long as the story lasted, and not for the story, for the missions. While both games offer new-game+ experiences, I just couldn't bring myself to do it with P2. It felt like funding had been cut after the missions had been basically designed, leaving a programmer to write the story and a modeller to design the open-world. Compared to Prototype 1, where I'm currently on new-game+ number four, I just can't recommend Prototype 2. It's fun for a day and that's the end of it, versus fun for as long as you're creative.

												This is ridiculous. What have you done, Activision? Prototype was one of the best sandbox games I've ever played. The controls are awesome, the protagonist was interesting and Alex Mercer was one hell of a killing machine. Never had I experienced such freedom to wreak havoc and the leveling system was enjoyable.Now, Prototype 2 is...  largely inferior to its predecessor, to say the very least. The protagonist is not charismatic at all and dumber than a box of nails. He's a much stereotypical videogame generic badass like only Activision knows how to do. Very bad QTEs and a stupid and extremely invasive tutorial marks the first part of the game. I generally enjoy a quick in-game tutorial, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen. This gets especially ridiculous when the game stops the gameplay to show you something you had to figure out for yourself earlier to advance. I'm not five year old, mind you.The great freedom you had in Prototype is now gone! The map is way smaller, and there is so much less to do. You can't choose your upgrades at will anymore! You have to wait until predetermined ''evolutions'' to add a point to one of a few attributes. And its not a new move, it's just statistics, like adding 10% sprint speed or 20% more damage. It's boring as hell.Also, the character asset design took one hell of a hit. The texture quality of Heller and other NPC/PC is just dreadful, especially when you compare it to the otherwise well textured and lighted environment. I believe it's even worst than the first game.The animation, to my surprise, is not very good either. The animation of vehicles during in-engine cutscenes is robotic, in a way similar to early 2000 games. I don't understand why the developper could not fix this.Now, the technical problems... This will be a deal breaker for many people. This game is just terribly optimized. There is a HUGE memory leak problem that was never (and will never without a doubt) be fixed. This appear to be related to ATI graphics cards. I have a rather solid rig which can run pretty much anything right now at max settings and at a 1680x1050 resolution. I possess 8Gb of RAM + 2GB GRAM. The game can run for approx 30 minutes before the leak occupies all the allocated RAM and starts to lag horribly. This time interval may be smaller if you have a smaller amount of RAM or your system is less powerful. The solution is to alt-tab out of the game when this happen and then go back. The leak will still continue and therefore, you are stuck doing this every 30 minutes or so.This is not a good game. It have many fragments of awesome, but the problems are just so many and so hard to get around that it just outweights its qualities. It's still Prototype though and you'll still have fun wreaking havoc around NYC (NYZ), but if that's all you wanted, go play the first. It got more moves and is funnier overall to play, while the graphics are sufficient to appreciate gameplay at this day.I don't know what you did to Radical during development, Activision, but you killed them, and you killed Prototype.I hate you for what you are doing to the gaming industry.That's all I have to say.

												I LOVE this game and played it four times over on the console, but the PC version is broken. There's a terrible memory leak problem that can cause every machine besides the most beastly of them (think more than 8 gigs of RAM) to have framerates in the 30s or lower from 60+ in a matter of minutes, and if you check your task manager, you can see the game is skyrocketing with RAM use as compared to most games. Now, you can make it go away by doing all sorts of PC gaming tricks, but mostly you will have to minimize and then re-open the game every few minutes. This is unacceptable for any game. Activision also does not support this game, if you try to get help from them then tell them that your desktop is custom built, they will simply tell you they do not support custom builds or laptops and hang up the phone. If you lie and say you have a pre-built machine (like Alienware) then they will tell you they're going to escalate the issue, but never get back to you.Honestly, unless you have a TON of RAM or don't mind constantly minimizing/re-opening the game or changing the graphics options every few minutes, then I say buy it, it's one of the best sequels I've ever played in my life that improves upon the original in every way I can think of. If not for its bad PC port status, I would give this game a glowing review, but as it stands, I can't stand to play any more of it on PC with these glaring issues that will never be fixed because Activision only cares about their money-printing games.EDIT: Works fine on my Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 laptopSpecs:MSI GT70Core i7 4700MQNvidia GeForce GTX 770m 3gb12 gb RAMRunning on a 7200 RPM HDD40+ FPS on max settings 1920x1080 with low anti-aliasing			",148,19,2,26,4,1,13

												Absolutely fantastic game.  Playing on intel/nvidia, have had absolutely zero problems.As to the gameplay itself, it kind of feels like I'm playing an amoral amalgamation of a bunch of the Marvel superheroes.  I've got the claws of Wolverine, the ability to knock people around like Magneto, the ability to shapeshift like Mystique, plus a variety of other things.Just running around the city is a freaking joy, to be honest.  You run straight up buildings, glide through the air, jump crazy distances, pounce on enemies or poor random citizens as you please, etc.  It feels like Spiderman without any sort of web-swinging restrictions, or Batman without any sort of grappling restrictions.To be clear, it's not a superhero game -- but it sure does feel more like one than any game I've played that actually features superheroes.  Then again, I'd classify the main character as ""mostly a villain, despite doing things that help the greater good.""  My guy isn't concerned with saving random citizens from battles that break out; he actually freaking EATS them to regain health.  Or to shapeshift into their form and escape detection.Basically nobody in this game is a good person at all, and I don't particularly have a problem with that.  Even the random citizens seem to be rude at best.Ultimately this boils down to a power-trip sort of game, with a good amount of challenge despite always making you feel incredibly badass.  That's hard to pull off, but this is done super well.Verdict: I would buy a sequel, no questions.  This game is absolutely worth full price.			",338,76,9,38,50,4,55

												At first I thought this game was broken... Once I fixed the lag issue I found that this is one of the most enjoyable third-person sandbox games for casual play, when I'm in the mood to lounge on the couch with a game pad, I turn on Steam's Big Picture Mode, launch the game and massacre the city for hours. The Radnet DLC add hours of challenges to beat friends high-scores.Many ATI Radeon users have experienced a memory leak that has made Prototype 2 unplayable. This fix seems to eradicate the issue and locks the client at 30fps, almost perfectly stable.1. Run Prototype 2 and disable Anti-Aliasing in the game client2. Download and install Radeon Pro Preview http://www.radeonpro.info/download/a. Create a profile for Prototype2.exe by searching in steamapps/common/prototype2b. On the ""Tweaks"" tab:VSync control : Always on (Double VSync)Dynamic Framerate C Keep up to : 30 FPS Maxc. On the ""Advanced"" tab:Flip Queue Size = 1 (Set to 1 and Check to Enable)3. Right click on the profile your created in RadeonPro and click ""Apply Now""4. Ensure RadeonPro is running and start the game normally.5. Play the game and enjoy!			",423,77,6,52,26,4,76

												Prototype 2 is not perfect and there are a few things which need to do a better job next game - like the lack of variation in missions - , but nonetheless this is one of the most visceral, spectacular and brutal sandboxes out there. Like a lot of action games, the story needs a bit of work, but if you can overcome it's minor short comings, this game can be a whole lot of fun.You may have a few hiccups here and there, but there's plenty to do in Prototype 2. More times than not, you'll have a blast doing all of it.Prototype 2 is a decent open-world action game, that does not invent the wheel, but it does manage to offer solid amounts of entertainment, splattered with generous servings of blood and mayhem.My only real concern is that this PC version is very conservative in comparison with the console version, with minimal graphical improvements and imprecise mouse+keyboard controls.The three month delay could have been used to make the most of the PC capabilities in my opinion. A rather poor treatment for the PC gamers.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Taking place a year after the events in the first Prototype, Prototype 2 is gritty, bloody story about revenge. You play as James Heller, a soldier in the military, freshly made infected by the main character of the last game, Alex Mercer. He has given you the power to get revenge for your wife and daughter, who died because of what is known as the Mercer Virus, supposedly released by Blackwatch (the acting military force in the New York (or what's left of it). As the game progresses, while the missions you do may change, revenge remains your motive, and anything that stands in your way will be killed, blown up, or consumed. I love the gameplay of Prototype 2. While it can get repetitive after too long, the effect of your attacks is oh so satisfying. Smash, cut, slice, dice, tear apart, and consume anyone that gets in your way, civilians and soldiers alike. Later in the game you can even drive tanks and fly in helicopters. There are 3 parts of the map that you unlock progressively through out the game, but I felt they did a good job with how long it takes you to unlock them. The story line isn't the greatest, until you get 2/3 into the game. The voice acting of the guy who played James Heller is amazing, and definitely gets you immersed in his character. This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. It's the definition of ""a bloody good time"".9/10 for me.			",152,16,4,8,7,0,3

												A friend helped me laying my hands on this during the summer sale so Credits to Bram first! <3So here it is - my review for 'Prototype 2' on Steam. If you are interested in my opinion of the Original 'Prototype' game you can find the review here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/IvanDankov/recommended/10150/ So this time it's yet again your turn to stop ""Blackwatch"" and the infection going on in ""NYZ"" but this time you are playing the role of the ex-military 'James Heller'. His team had an operation in ''NYZ'' but got killed when they encountered the main antagonist of the game: 'Alex Mercer'. -Unlike his goal in Prototype 1 he now wants to take over the City and kind of re-populate with evolved made by him with similar abilities . As the only survivor of his attack.. he infectes you with the ""Mercer Virus"" and now the game begins. We discover that it was Mercer killing his wife and daughter with his ""second outbreak"" of the mercer virus (first outbreak would be the one of 'Prototype 1') and now crave for revenge and make him suffer as we did. During all this yet again alot of twists will come up and in the end you find yourself chasing after something way more important than 'Alex Mercer' himself.. Thats it from me about the story since I dont like revealing too much for potential buyers. The gameplay stays more or less the same as in one with further improvements and a combat system to die for.Its too much fun running, flying, slashing ,beating or body surfing your way through the City with an endless amout of ways to kill people, new monsters and tons of side missions that can keep you busy for a good while. I even recommend buying the DLC ""RADNET Access Pack"" if it's on sale since it adds new activities and a ranking system for you and your friends that unlocks rewards and Skins for 'Heller' if you complete them. The achievments are again just fun to attempt with good challenges and references to movies or other games.The graphics though are a mixed bag to me...some of the textures just look like they are from 2002 while animations and especially 'Hellers' different forms look very detailed and cool. But overall they are perfect fitting for a game like that and I am sure it won't stand in your way. Again I was using an Nvidia Graphics Card and haven't encountered any technical issues with that game on highest settings but I am aware that 'AMD' cards are horribly optimized in this game so I'd recommend to get it on console ('AMD' users) if you have one. On sale both (Game + DLC) cost me ~ 10 bucks and I dare to say that its a good invenstment since you can spend a good amount of hours in this game trying to complete it 100%. If you just care about the Story (wich may not be the most interesting for everyone) you can leave the DLC behind and finish the main Story in about 10 hours then quit and have another game on your ""Story-Completed-List"". Overall I can say that if you loved the first one you will cheat on it with PROTOTYPE 2. Gameplay feels more satisfying than in any other third person game (with hack 'n slay elements ofc) and the over the top gore is just great. I highly recommend yet another game of my list that I used to love back in 2012 / 2013 and now got it again on steam.As always I hope that my review was good / helpful and you might have found something interesting for yourself.Have a good day! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Because you can play like a god, slicin' and dicin' through hordes of enemy's.Blood everywhere and giant monsters to kill!It gives some satisfaction because of all the power you have. One of the best games i've played. 9/10			",34,6,3,4,8,1,1

												Recomended!The Good:Feel like the most powerful being, unleash devastating powers on the world, use everything, destroy all and everything. This feeling doesn't go away fast, it feels great! The gameplay is great! Using the tendrills is fantastic! I actually liked the storyNew game+The Bad:I see a lot of people saying they have issues. I haven't had a single bug, or crash.It took me 13 hours to go through the story and unlock everything (on normal), feels to short...The Ugly:James Heller is a very cool guy, yet I'd like to see more of his background known. Some things are copied from the previous game.Cheesy oneliners.			",201,53,2,27,27,1,19

												More of the same if you played the previous Prototype game but still fun, The story is good and the gameplay mechanics are solid, The only downside of the game is the lack of diversity. After the one-hundredth consume this guy, watch a cut-scene, get the codes, kill that guy you start to feel like you've seen it all.. Beside that the game is worth finishing even if you just do it for the Epic End Battle ;-)			",149,39,4,11,6,1,16

												Prototype 2 is the perfect example of how to create a sequel that somehow manages to less than the game that precedes it. While it maintains much of the same gameplay of the original everything has been cut down in size and scope. Smaller world, less enemies, less powers, less weapons, less vehicles, less moves, shorter storyline. Even the graphics are not as impressive. You could switch the numbers at the end of the two Prototype games and it would be more logical.The combat is still great fun but with less enemies and less types of enemies fighting them becomes very predictable very quickly and with less powers, weapons and moves at your disposal you have very little option for mixing it up.The movement scheme with the parkour and infected powers is still one of the greatest open world movement systems around but because New York City has been downsized quite severely and now exists in small zones you can't really take advantage of the movement the same way you could in the original.Perhaps the biggest clue that this wasn't going to be an equal to the original comes in the form of the storyline and the character development. Instead of the mysterious and morally conflicted protagonist of the original Prototype 2 casts you as a random jar-head out for revenge but quickly goes on a mission to save the world in an all too predictable way. The storyline of Prototype was obviously concocted by someone that have never bothered to play the original, almost all of the major plot-points and revelations of the original are either ignored or contradicted directly. All the shades of morality have been sucked out of the game and instead of the morally ambiguous characters and grey story of the original we get a predictable story about a angelically inclined hero versus a bunch of bad guys that are portrayed like Joseph Mengeler's meaner older brother.Don't bother with this game, the original was a great play and I still heartily recommend it but the sequel is simply not worth the bother.

												Definitely a love.I've never made myself to complete a game fully in months. But i had to play this one just to know how the story ends. And I'm pretty amazed.Story is very interesting when you pass the 30% of it but its also very short and you can complete it in 5 or 6 hours and maybe less if you ignore all collectibles and any side missions and achievements.Graphics are also very much improvement against first game. Game also has many performance issues that never been patched. But they very much dodged me. I don't have AMD so i only turn of Raptr to play the game.Gameplay is pretty much the same as first game. You can destroy everything with mashing a button and even destroy trees cuz we all know that trees in games are usually gods. You again can use abilities and run like a Flash, fly, scale buildings only using your legs and jump 5 meters high... Also u can fight zombies and mutants.. And an army... Fun...I would definitely recommend the game if you know how to dodge the performance issues.Cheers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Just as rich as part 1-There is no humour here, game is a grim-dark open world game about the player being a living bio-weapon.You run up buildings, glide above the city, absorb humans to regain health and wear their face.You throw cars at choppers and slay soldiers with your viral tendrils.The game values your time and is fast action without being to long or inserting artificial lengtheners. Collectibles give you new powers and aren't useless like in other games. The story about revenge and conspiracy is forgettable, this is meant as a power trip.I had no technical problems playing the game with my gear (Nvidia card, Windows 10).As a German: get the game key from Humble store to circumvent the authoritarian censorship.Hope someone picks up on the IP of being some superpowered anti-hero virus weapon in the future, formula felt quite unique.

												Prototype 2 was an alright game. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great. Some new additions, skills and abilities from the first game, but not much change other then the advancement of story line.The story line takes place after Alex Mercer has released the virus and begun infecting New York City. He has become corrupt with power and seeks destruction. It almost seems generic as the first game, but still quite playable. I did enjoy it, as much as I could, but probably not as much as I did with the first Prototype. The story line did play out pretty well, but they could have done a much better job with this epidemic.The combat system was alright as well. It had some new additions and skills to go with it, but like I mentioned before, not many. The combat is very gory. Much to be expected from a game of infection. The input of the combat didn't differ much from the first Prototype. I also think they could've done more with this as well. It's always from to drop from 1000ft to Ground Zero and devour someone for their health and identity. Always useful when trying to escape from the armed forces.A lot of work and changes should have been made before release. I would recommend getting this on special if you are at all interested in this game. It's still a good game, just not a great game. I completed it in under 20 hours.3/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm sure there is a solution for this on the internet but this is just a warning to not so tech savy people also the game is a bit clunky in the controls but so was the first one having said that it plays better than console ported games.

												I don't understand why more people didn't play this game when it was released. This is one of my favourite games, it's fun, immersive and well designed. There are some technical problems with it now and it is a shame that the PC port isn't better.I read today that there is a Biohazard collection available on PS4 and Xbone with both this, the first game and the DLC included. GameSpot reviewed it and just criticised how it's a bad port on those systems as well. They didn't mention any of the games strenghts which is normal actualy when it comes to the Prototype series but a big shame in my opinion.With a few tweaks here on PC the game is running pretty good for me. However there are still some frame drops and some stuttering but this decreases in the later areas. It's a shame that I can't experience it with better performance but it's still an amazing game. Which I am enjoying alot regardless of these issues.It's packed with interesting content, immersive menu screens, good sound design and a great athmosphere throughout.I put a SweetFx profile on it too and it looks pretty good. It's just a shame nobody has modded in a HD remaster yet like they did with Remember Me for example.Anyway, I highly recommend you buy and play this game, especially if it's on sale.Grab the Radnet DLC too for more cool content.Even with it's technical problems the game can still be enjoyed and is definitely worth playing.I googled some fixes before I started and I'm having a blast with it now.

												It's sad that this game has a bad reputation, partly for the screwed up AMD Card support.Under that perspective I can recommend the game under some conditions:- You know it runs on your system.- you like feeling like a badass- You are searching for a 20-40 hour single player experienceI loved the game. The gameplay has improved from the first one and just feels way more fleshed out in many ways, but the story seems more standard than anything. Nothing really you wouldn't expect.I was compelled to play the game on hard and get all the achievements, because it was overall well designed and it didn't take long. I'm thankful for this complete experience with closure. On a more funny side: this game ruined my Assassin's Creed experience, because Prototype is way faster with more action and you just run up buildings instead of climbing it.			",176,40,4,22,21,0,33

 PROTOTYPE 2 This is one of the games that YOU should play if you are STRESSED. You are an overpowered being with lots of powers. You can consume people to get life and memories. You can fly around the city and run incredibly fast. You can use people as BIOBOMBS. You can ELIMINATE a whole army without even getting a single scratch. Pros  Cool, Overpowered passive abilities New Bigger Map, NYZ It is much easier to use the powers for you can use 2 of them without changing it in the weapon wheel New Powers, most of the powers in the game replaced the other powers in the first game New Jumping System ( Others would take this as a con ) An improvement over the first one, Stealth Consume, Weapons, Graphics (Obviously), Combat, etc. Cons  There is a bug in the mission,  specifically ""Operation Flytrap"" , where after some time you cannot continue after doing the  Claw Pounce Attack to the Blackwatch Soldier  unless if you go the settings of the game in the task manager and change how many processors are running it. The bug doesn't appear in every computer though. WHY IS ALEX MERCER THE ANTAGONIST OF THE GAME?EDIT: Nevermind I just read the comics This is not much of a con for me but there are a lot of Removed Powers and Moves (R.I.P. Muscle Mass and Armor). Most of them are useless anyways Neutral To be honest, the story and characters were fine. MY RATING 9.5 / 10Would use people as BIOBOMBS again			",13,0,0,0,1,0,0

												First installed this game back in 2014. Was running AMD Radeon R7 250 series, was working fine for 2 hours and then the game Blue Screened my computer, the drivers became corrupt and I had to reinstall my drivers. The game was no longer able to run after. Thinking it was my computer, and expanded my library after 2 years, I figured I would install with a new graphics, new i7 processor and more RAM but the game glitched out within the first 10 minutes.I should have read the reviews stating that this game is not AMD friendly. I am doing a crossfire within my chipset with AMD cards, and this game is the only one that is not as graphic intensive as my other games. I have left this uninstalled. Glad I got this during a steam sale, because it would be depressing to spend 40 dollars for something I cannot play.But during the time I did play, the game is fun. Mechanics are smooth. Storyline is great. But too bad I did not get that far in the storyline.>>AMD Users, stay away from this game. I have been waiting for updates to this game and have not seen any yet.

												Great super-hero game just like the first one. You play a real bad♥♥♥♥♥guy who gets stronger and stronger with each mission. The powers you get are fun to play with and there is this feeling of freedom although you'll have to play the missions in a certain order to get further in the game. With this game engine they could make a game for every marvel hero there is. I hope someday someone in the game industry gets the same idea. The game and the scenes are dark and ads to the total gameplay. When you finish the story you can play Game+ which means you can play the game again and keep the powers you have earned so that you can max all of them. I'm halfway in my second playthrough and still not bored. Some people have troubles with this game because of their video-card. I play with a Nvidia and the game works fine. Great game!

												When you first start playing this game, it's epic. When you watch videos of the end game powers and moves, you think to yourself ""Damn, thats gonna be so cool to have!"". In reality, the game is extremely repetitive and boring with a dull story line. By the time you get the powers you wanted at the beginning, you're already bored of the game and it's really nothing new. The only thing I slightly enjoy about this game is running down the streets desimating everything in my path. Even then, it doesnt take long for me to get bored. Last thing I'm going to say is that the final fight is just lame and boring. Wouldn't recommend this game. 4/10			",89,2,3,6,10,0,2

												Definitely recommend this. It's fun and the campaign is interesting. However,I wil admit to free roaming more than doing the story missions,just because it's fun to have so much power. I have already completed the campign 2 times. It is that good. Also has high replay value. The game will allow you to start a new campaign with the current abilities and augments that you have gotten for yourself so if you want to do the story again but with your current powers then by all means do so. Which is why I have already completed the game 2 times and I plan to continue playing it. Beautiful city with good graphics. Definitely a must buy :D			",25,3,0,0,0,0,0

												As other users have pointed out, IF YOU HAVE AN AMD CARD, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME! I had an older AMD card (HD 6670) and it played it ""fine"" except that after like 10 mintues it got slower and slower, especially after in game cutscenes like picking up black boxes. The reason why I said ""fine"" was because when you alt+tabbed out and back in, the game ran properly again. This led to me having to alt+tab every 10 mintues or so just to have a good playing experience. Then, one day, I wanted to play and the game ran like absolute garbage. You would think I was trying to do a real time simulation of the universe on my computer from how slow it was. I'm talking literally 0-3 fps with occasional jumps to 6-13. Even after I got a much better AMD card (R9 380 nitro), the game ran exactly the same, 0-3 fps on a card that can run GTA V and Witcher 3 at 30 fps on max settings. The devs didn't just drop the ball, they hit AMD users in the face with it. I am just glad I got about 60 hours out of this game before it went to the lowest circle of hell.			",117,12,3,13,6,0,1

												Now, in my opinion, Prototype 1 is superior to this one in alot of ways, it was one of the best open world games I have played, hacking and slashing your way through New York was really fun. Now, Prototype 2 is a really good and fun game in my opinion. The gameplay is pretty much the same with the controls etc, but the game takes away some freedom you had in prototype 1. And I've heard alot of negative responses because the main character is black, but I personally don't mind. I like this change. The story can also be a bit better, they shouldn't have taken the revenge thingy again, but it SOMEWHAT fits in, if there is going to be another Prototype game, it needs some better lore. Overall, the game is worth playing, and very addicting at that.7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my most favourite games of all times . The first game is also awesome.I am just sad that this game will never ever get a sequel cause the studio was shut down :(Awesome gore , good fighting and story , love the black/white/red intersections.I know a lot of games change their screens when you are near death / almost out of life / but i felt this one made it special to its style.

												it's a fun game , but gotta admit once you beat the story and get all powerups its kinda boring. Well its fun while it lasted, if you live in a DEVELOPING COUNTRY i recommend to buy it when it's 50% off or more not really worth full price cause you can finish nearly everything in about 15 hours  while the rest of my gameplay hour is just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around with pedestrians[SPOILER ALERT]Once you get hammerfist you pretty much rekt everything , even alex mercer is no match for your glorious hand job maximus. I mean everything is no match for your hammerfist except alex mercer hammerfist which is why big bang exist. This kinda make the game less fun cause you literally just smack the ground and watch your enemy bouncing to death helplessly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't a bad game. It's not a great game either, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable, even though I didn't really like the first game. While the first game had fun (if a bit unpolished) gameplay, it lacked heavily in it's story and characters. This game on the other hand, has a much better story and characters, but the developers attempted to streamline the combat and powers, which causes the gameplay to be a bit of a step back.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Much better story and characters than in the first game-Plenty of side-missions and collectiblesCons:-Not much variation in combat, especially compared to the first game-Graphics seem a bit unpolished for a 2012 game-Fighting multiple strong enemies at the same time can be frustrating-Relatively short main story content (less than 8 hours on Normal)While I do have more cons than pros listed, I would say that the enjoyment I've gotten out of the game jusitifies the purchase, and I would recommend picking it up, especially if you enjoyed the first game.That said, definitely buy it on sale. As enjoyable as the game is, the base price of $40 is a bit expensive for the amount of content you're getting.			",121,17,0,7,11,0,4

												When I saw what rating this game has, I was stunned.  I've played through from start to finish three times and am now starting my fourth.  There's an incredible amount of replayability with NG+, all of the radnet challenges and tonnes of collectibles.I found the combat to be very impactful and the unlocks are quite well paced.  Loads of skins and bonus toys (cheats, basically) are around for those who have beaten the game.  There are (what feels like) hours of backstory cutscenes done with real people in a weird ultra edited kind of style that are a blast to watch, too.My complaints would be that James Heller and Alex Mercer are both a bit bland and the story from the direct perspective of the player has a way to go to be truly immersive and believable (the backstory scenes tell the story very well, but these are optional and a lot is left out during the main course of the game).  The combat is what completely makes up for it, for me.  In fact, the Prototype games are side-by-side my favourite games of all time.DISCLAIMER: It looks like a lot of people are having trouble with AMD cards.  If you have one, take care when purchasing this game.  I haven't had any trouble with this game on my GTX 960.			",248,32,9,31,40,1,72

												[8.0/10]So, is this game worth it ? depends on how much you enjoy it's awesome mobility and it's particular brand of mass destruction, wrench anyone asunder in gory cascades of blood and guts with a large variety of attacks. and how much you're willing to forgive it's mundane missions that offer no real challenge, wrapped in a story that lacks substance and originality.Radical Entertainment might not know how to tell a great story, but they sure know how to make an extremely entertaining game experience.

												I liked the first Prototype. The combat and movement mechanics were fantastic, while the world felt full of life. It had an uncanny sense of complete chaos, like as it was hard to see the difference between civilians and zombies in the crowds. The second game builds on the world design from the first game and creates an even more believable sense of bewildering chaos. It’s so much that it’s hard to take in if you just stand and look at it all. Any ideas you might have of avoiding collateral damage quickly go out the window. You just can’t help killing crowds of innocents when dealing with the military or monsters in the city. The city is just too dense for combat.Prototype 2 is a wasted opportunity. The world design is the perfect stage for any post-apocalyptic game. It’s teeming with details and history. The art department really went all out in creating a believable world. Even the sound design is impressive. It’s subtle, and has a carefully designed wide dynamic range. It’s full of details, like car tires squealing when an NPC slams the brakes to avoid hitting you. It’s a competent studio pulling out some of the best work of the generation. And it’s all ruined by the story.I don’t know what they were thinking when they signed off on the script. Did someone high up decide that this was fine, because “it’s just a game”? The story and characters are about as shallow as they get. Nobody has anything resembling a personality or a story arc through the game. They all look different, but the way they speak, their motivations and their roles in the story is all devoid of texture or depth. It’s just flat and boring, and as a result you can’t get engaged in anything going on. The mechanics are all great, and the mission designs are acceptably good. But there’s no excitement to see what happens next. Despite the abysmal story and characters I still had a good time playing the game, thanks to everything else being good. But make no mistake, this game is instantly forgettable. You barely know what’s going on even as it’s happening, because it’s all flat and monotone. It’s like going on a nice sightseeing trip through a nightmare vision of New York. But we’ve already seen plenty of those, so that might not have much novelty value. I wanted to play the game after playing Saints Row 4, because SR4 basically copy-pasted the game mechanics of Prototype. For the €5 I paid Prototype 2 was worth it, but I can’t get over what a wasted opportunity this was. Every other component is here for a phenomenal game, but they decided that players don’t care about story and that this level of ambition is fine. And it just isn’t.			",277,52,9,27,7,0,6

												UPDATE:  There is a fix that if applied makes the game work great if you are running an AMD card:http://steamcommunity.com/app/115320/discussions/0/451852225145790704/I changed it to recommended but you have to take into consideration that if it were not for the community, this game would still be unplayable for me.  Thanks to the community, however, I am recommending this game because you can get it to work, albeit in a roundabout way that does not include the work of the developers trying to fix the problem.  Great game though.  Old Review: This game starts running at 1fps, and then after the first cutscene, it goes down again to 1fps, then crashes.  This game is utterly unplayable and they will not be patching it.  Avoid if you have an AMD card.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's different to the first game - better, worse? Just different. There are not as many powers in this game, but then the first one had ones you'd never use. Running around the city in some ways is easier in this game, but I had more fun doing it in the first one - but the fiddly bits of running up buildings have gone, which makes this one better. Obviously the graphics are better in this one. The protagonist in this one seems to be badly written, and fills too many stereotype boxes. It's not quite blacksploitation, but something about ""Hell ♥♥♥♥in' yeah!"" doesn't sit quite right with me.Now if someone can tell me what the hell happened to Alex Mercer between the first game and this one, that'd be great.

												I love this game, the campaign was around 11-12 hours on normal difficulty; so if it's on sale it's definatly worth a purchase. It does have a couple of problems however. Firstly it is quite graphicly intensive, i have a decent PC that can play games like battlefield 4 on high/ultra settings and get 70-80 fps; however on this game with medium settings i only get around 60-70 fps 'SO BE AWARE'Secondly it has a very bad issue with memory usage. For me, after about an hour playing, it starts to get really laggy & unplayable; which normally results in me having to restart the game (which is annoying if your in the middle of a mission)Thirdly the game sometimes randomly CTD's without any warning, normally for me after around 2-4 hours playing.Finally for me everytime I use the 'pack leader ability' my screen freezes, the game is still playing in the background as you can hear the audio and still target things, however you can't see your character just the frozen moment when you used the ability (this hinders the game as a couple of times during the story as you have to use the ability to complete missions)Apart from these things, I have noticed a couple of glitches with wall running, stealth consumes and AI; but overall i would highly recommend this game.IF IT IS ON OFFER GRAB IT!EDIT: Since I upgraded some of my hardware the game either refuses to boot, or runs at around 3 FPS even with everything on low. So take care when choosing to buy this game or not.			",98,29,0,11,12,2,6

												Become A Ultimate Shape-Shifting Weapon Taking place a year after the events in the first Prototype, Prototype 2 is gritty, bloody story about revenge. You play as James Heller, a soldier in the military, freshly made infected by the main character of the last game, Alex Mercer. He has given you the power to get revenge for your wife and daughter, who died because of what is known as the Mercer Virus, supposedly released by Blackwatch (the acting military force in the New York (or what's left of it). As the game progresses, while the missions you do may change, revenge remains your motive, and anything that stands in your way will be killed, blown up, or consumed. 9,9/10 Will like it			",33,6,0,3,4,0,1

At one point I took a screenshot, it crashed the game. Not to mention that sometimes the game won't even startup in the first place.

Well bs, there is a solution on internet for this - just google it... it's how I fixed my problems (yes I am AMD user) and I had clean fps ever since. **What worked for me is I changed CatalystAI key value to 30 and CatalystAI_DEF key value to 0**As for the game itself:-graphics: beautiful graphic and effects >> 9/10-gameplay: I liked the movement way more than the first game, and lots of people say that Prototype 1 had more and better stuff, well, I agree and disagree, but imo, gameplay is fantastic and I had fun every second of it >> 9/10-story: yeah, as others may already have said, it's not as good as Prototype 1 buuut ehh it's fine I guess, Heller's jokes crack me up tho >> 7/10Overall thoughts: I liked the game from the start, and I think it's one of most fun games I've played - cus of free roam and killing; some people are desperate with the ending, but I liked the ending (it's my personal opinion that I actually rooted for Heller to win over Mercer); and I believe this game is so underrated >> 8/10 ",87,25,2,14,1,0,6

												This game is a big improvement from the first Prototype.  The story flows better, the graphics are better, and the combat improved.If you played Prototype, this game will continue that story.  However playing P1 is not necessary and I would actually just skip it and watch a video of the story element or just watch the summary of P1 that is included in P2’s main menu.From the very beginning, your abilities quickly grow to feeling much more powerful than you ever were in the first game.  I can’t tell you how awesome it was to use Tendrils to so quickly and easily bring down red alert helicopters chasing me.Combat has been improved by adding dodge and counter options helping to make you really outclass your opponents and escape hunter/brawlers “juggling” hits.There are still some repetitious side quests, but the story around them helps keep things interesting.  This may have led to the feeling that experience was a lot easier to come across.  It was never very long before I had obtained another upgrade.Rating – 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototye 2 is a game that allows you to destroy a world with a variety of powers and abilities.  The powers are by far the strong point of the game becuase it keeps the combat from becoming bland and repetitive.  Other than that the story is over the top in the best way possible and the writing is filled with many ridiculous one liners.  the game does suffer from some problems like the lack of content after the game.  Once you have finnished the main story you would exspect a variety of side quests and missions.  You will be dissapointed to find that there is little to nothing to do other than lair takovers that only grant you a mini boss and some extra exspirience.  The game also has little replayability becuase the story is so linear and you obtain every power in every game you play you will find little reason to play the game again.  That being said I enjoyed the time I did spend during the 9+ hour main story so I have to give credit where its do.  7.5/10			",192,43,0,24,18,2,32

There's plenty of people on the ground, cars don't really appear, as everything is in a military lock down.  You the hero basically run around running up buildings and leap / glide around the world.  The level system works well letting you pit skill points where you see fit. The story is good,  your piecing together events from memories of those you consueEarly on the game will bug out when using the claws,  there's a affinity bodge that works well and once done you can set the game back to all cores.

												Prototype 2 is a good sequel of the first game, with improved graphics and gameplay.The difficulty of the sequel seems to be somewhat lower, the Insane difficulty being locked until you clear the game for the first time.The animations can sometimes be choppy, most of the combos locking you down and preventing you from moving in any other direction but forward. Also, the verticality provided by the tall buildings is only enjoyable in parkour, with only 1 attack per weapon that targets airborne enemies or structures, the other ones just sending you like a comet towards the ground.The graphics are okay for 2015, some of the ground / wall textures being low quality. Also, props like AC units, cars or other things you can throw are simple and look decent.The pacing of the game tends to be fast, although the player can approach enemies in multiple ways, even with ranged attacks and military weapons. If you are playing close-range melee, chances are you won't even notice the low-quality textures or the dumb civilian AI...The story is...compelling at most. I've completed the main story + all //BLACKNET sidequests (each one has 2-3 missions) in about 20 hours.The soundtrack is nothing special, SFX being fair and the  voice acting being on the bright side.As conclusion, here are my ratings for the game:7.5 / 10  Graphics7 / 10     Animations7 / 10     Audio (OST + SFX)7 / 10     Story8 / 10     GameplayOverall: 7.3 / 10 ",174,31,6,15,13,0,9

												A very good action game. I liked it enough to get all of the achievements. I think it plays better than the original prototype, though it kind of kills the personality of the main character from the first game. You play as a soldier who gets infected with a disease that has been producing horrific monsters all over the city. You start with a few mutations, I think you get claws first, and you get more stuff as you level up like hammer fists, a whip fist, and tentacles. I would say about 50% of the powers and stuff from the original game return, the rest is new. It also replaces those stupid orbs with blackbox collection and scientist elimination, which is much more interesting. I would say it is an improvement on the original game, except for the fact that it makes Alex Mercer look super lame.I am aware of a bug that causes the game to be unplayable with a mouse and keyboard, but I have played the game on three different computers with a mouse and keyboard setup and had no problems.Graphics are pretty mediocer. Music can be good at times, but for the most part it's pretty forggetable. The story is pretty basic, but it does the job. I would generally recommend this game, it is pretty decent all around and it isn't too specifically designed in it's appeal.7/10 would use a random civilian to bio-bomb a paniced mass of civilians again.

												All the little touches that made the original so great are missing. In Prototype 1 beating on a zombie was like an elegant dance that you had full control over how it was executed. The combat system in Prototype 2 was chopped to pieces and sewn back together from Prototype 1 all in the name of letting you use two abilities at once. But those abilities only have half the options in the name of making you able to hot-swap them faster. You also only get one new main power different from Prototype 1. I CANNOT RECCOMEND PROTOTYYPE 1 ENOUGH but 2 is an unworthy successor. The commercial got me all jazzed and the game let me down.			",513,104,0,55,25,1,36

												read all of it srry IMORTANTmost amzing game ever but DO NOT PLAY ON WINDOWS 8 YOUR COMPUTER WILL CRASH ON THIS GAME AND ALL OTHERS IN THE FUTURE EVEN LIGHT GAMES so you could be in the middle of a mission and you will get DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (IGKDM64.SYS) OR BSOD (BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH) but its almost worth it the story is over the edge of your fast paced intense and still realy fun it makes you feel like a god all the power you comand. the blade the best close quarters but ranged i like the wip fist you can grab an enemy soldier from a great distance and consume them instead of going up to them 1 at a time you can just still and bring them to you. there is also a lesson that heller learns whith great power comes great responsibility to not let the power consume you and lose sight of your virtues before it too late it takes a death of a friend his only one who also told him to not lose sight of justice and revenge he still ignored it spoiler stop its father guara or something spanish im dyslexic like a marvel hero we all no and stan dont sue :) i put my heart into this please enjoy it and just lose the next few days in front of the xbox or playstation!!

												Game crashes on startup, turns out it's an incredibly common problem.  The ""fix"" is to unplug all of your usb devices except the mouse and then start the game up.  However, in my case, the game did not detect my mouse or my keyboard after getting past the main menu and into a new game.  So I could only move the camera and attack.  There's no mod support, and all potential links for a fix I found on various forms are dead.  X360ce also does not alleviate the problem.  This product really should not be able to be purchased, it's a broken game.			",72,11,0,14,5,0,4

												Prototype is one of those few games nowadays that remember to be fun. You have the option to eat an old lady, steal her identity and use it to butcher countless hordes of innocent civilians/incredibly evil mercenaries. Any game in which you can sprout swords from your very own spaghetti flesh deserves a reccomendation in my book.You start off in the least screwed up area where it sets the stage to show you just how cartoonishly evil Blackwatch are (see slaughtering autistic child for no discernible reason). It also allows you to hone your wallrunning old lady killing Blackwatch disgruntling skills. The game truly does deliver a sense of just how powerful you are when you can run up walls and obliterate anyone who so much as comments on your spaghetti appearance in a hurtful manner.While overall I like the story and it does throw some curveballs your way it gives you no real reason to care about any of the characters (at least not until 3 quarters of the story in that is) for any reason other than ""CAUSE HELLER LIKES HIM!"" or ""WHO CARES IF THAT PERSON IS LESS TRUSTWORTHY THAN A BLOODSTAINED PERSON IN A HOCKEY MASK BREAKING INTO YOUR HOUSE WHILST TELLING YOU HOW TO INCREASE YOUR MANHOOD"".Moreover it is very difficult to make Heller seem like a good person when you're just gonna murder ten families as soon as the cutscene ends, which is odd because the game does try to do so. It fails horribly.....but it does try. ""My family is dead!"" is not a good defence for murdering half the human bloody population! *Minor spoiler alert* it becomes a bit ludicrous at a point where he is about to kill someone and then at the last moment he realises that the target has children so he decides against it...I'm sorry what! Does the Mercer virus make you as thick as a vault door or something? Even if you only count the kills mandated by the story then there surely must be millions of bereft families by that point. It's a bit bloody late to start caring now.Despite it's flaws it is a genuinely fun game and I would reccomend it to someone wanting either a fun sandbox game or a surprise-a-bunch-of-soldiers-that-you're-their-friend-and-then-punch-them-so-hard-they-cough-up-your-wedding-ring simulator.

												THIS IS HOW OPEN WORLD GAMES WITH DESTRUCTION SHOULD BE ! Probably you are like wtf ? This game is absolutly sick , if you love destruction and just wrecking everything ,then this game is definitly for you ! You play as a Soldier and get infected after that ..... Everything becomes different.You become an absolutly bloody , amazing killer with so many destruction options.If you got Radnet Dlc You can fire Laser and blow up tanks and more.You like to play with tanks ? Go ahead !Hijack one and blow the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them !You want to fly with a helicopter ? Do it ! And terrorize the town or wreck the infection.Your abilities are also pretty sick.Tendrils,Claws,Sword,Whipe and Hammerfist.Also you can consume and copy everyones look.So no one will ever know , who you are.Sometimes it's required for some missions or just to start a pretty sick ambush attack or making hijacking a bit easier ,if you prefer it like that.Radnet Dlc add some more options like Laser beams shooted by your eyes or destroy stuff ,while you push yourself off from the ground and creating shockwaves or smashing down on the ground and more sick stuff.You will notice you are pretty overpowered and this games makes you feel like a badass.""Nothing can stop you!"",thats what the Devs did pretty well in this game,even if you play it on insane .You are still overpowered as ♥♥♥♥.Also its kinda interesting just to walk around as a soldier or as a civil person and take a look ,how peoples react on you.It's cool and really sick.Or look and listen to the peoples reactions or what they talk about.For me its a feeling , that i rarely get in some other games.Also the feeling you get in some Zones is kinda amazing.What i really like is how they created those ""Zones"" .I'm talking about the ""Red Zone"",""Yellow Zone"" And ""Green Zone"".The Red zone is overrunned by infected and is a war between Soldiers and Infected,while some Survivors try to stay alive,which you see sometimes flee from the Infected.The Yellow zone is a military zone ,where peoples are may infected or not.Also there are alot of Scanners and Scandrones seeking for infected.It`s really nice and well made to see those ""Villages"" build by metals and seeing the Soldier patrolling around.I really like it.The Green zone is the ""Non infected zone"".Here are n Infected or well almost.It`s pretty sick to see the peoples how they enjoy their life and feeling in safety , until you send them to hell...Of course there is a downside in this game.First: is that the Zones feels kinda small .Well they are not soo tiny , but they could be more bigger.Second: some Players have some issues with starting or playing the game sadly.Third: you will notice some glitches like peoples looking up to the sky ,while running away.It`s hiliarous and some more bugs,but no bugs , that i think is ""gamebreaking""Fourth: It lacks a bit ""Variations"" , if you played Prototype 1 , then you know what i mean.There could be more abilities and more destruction stuff.This game and those Devs is/made such an amazing game , if you seek for destruction and explosion,then go buy it!Seriously!I wish there would be another Prototype 3 , but sadly the Company got all fired -____-.Atleast it's a rumor.Still the game is amazing and still in my eyes one of the best games ,which got ever created.Those Devs today should try to create a game similiar to this.It's amazing and sick !Also the feeling in all those Zones or the Sound .It's stunning for me.And of course the Radnet Dlc offers you some Skin varations + some mods aswell.I highly recommend this game and hope that there will be a Prototype 3 , a mix between Prototype 1 and 2 !

Prototype 2			* 8/10Finally the only ""superpower-freeroaming-simulator"" on pc is back. And angrier than before.+++Pros+++- Gameplay. Prototype was awesome, now the sequel is awesome as well. Running through the city, jumping from palace to palace, climbing a skyscraper, and gliding through the sky... Simply awesome. Now the city looks bigger as well. The formula for the first game is working really fine in this second chapter as well, the powers, the management of the skills, the enemies.---Cons---- Those damn PS exclusive will never come to PC and Prototype was the only game of this kind.

												This is the sort of game I play to pass the time. It's worth getting if you're a fan of single player campaign missions or a fan of mauling any being you come into contact with. The cutscene styles are amazing, giving you access to limited colours that mainly consist of red, and the occasional blue from a computer screen (not blue screen of death). These cutscenes are very well animated and great to watch. It isn't only those scenes that are greatly satisfying though, when you 'consume' a specific target in the game, you are able to access their memories and previous thoughts or just be able to access the correct information you are looking for. These scenes are also well animated and well thought through, they don't give you a lot of easily noticeable imagery as it skips between images and people and small clips very quickly, but, that also makes it all the better to watch as it is mainly the talking that allows you to breifly understand what is going on in the fast paced images. Furthermore, the gameplay is relatively smooth, but it moves around and sends you of course more often than I had hoped, I have played the console version of this game and I would have to say that it was not much different to this one really, just, the controls are a lot easier to understand as there are a lot less buttons to press and hold. So, I would encourage you to use a controller rather than the keyboard. Overall, the rating of this game would be 7/10. If you found this helpful. You're welcome.			",101,20,3,4,17,0,8

												Much like The Force Unleashed 2 this is vastly superior to it's predecessor and is yet considered to be the inferior one. I don't know how this happens, perhaps it's just ""this one came first syndrome"". Point being almost every flaw or problem I had with the first one is solved in this one. Again, just like TFU2 I played through and enjoyed the first way back on the 360 and never got a chance to play their sequels until very recently. Maybe I'm just less patient with older games that don't qulaify as retro yet but I found the firsts of both games to be kinda... meh. Like, they just didn't age well and this one still feels kinda- well 'fresh' is pushing it but you know what I mean.The story's cool, the way they turned the protagonist of the first into the antagonist was dope. They've done away with the whole ""web"" thing and just given side missions from a military terminal which involves hunting a dude, doing a mission and consuming some guys organs and memories. The combat is a little tighter and generally better looking than the first, the controls and movement are all improved and there is a great line involving skull♥♥♥♥ing. Also I played this on Windows 10 on max settings, 60fps without a hitch and my GPU is a 670. While that doesn't guarantee it'll run perfectly for everyone I've seen a few reviews mentioning bad performance as a core negative aspect so I thought I'd mention it.			",182,19,8,8,1,1,4

												The first game was a joy to play. Sandboxy and full of action. Prototype 2 has all those elements and some more that would make it an awesome game. However it isn't due to extremely bad PC optimisation. The game is laggy on a rig that runs Battlefield 4 on rather good settings. That makes it a pain to play.I can't believe the engine went through the quality test. ",271,49,3,41,13,1,11

												Rarely where you will meet so controversial game. Like and boring , but it touches something . Graphics, compared with the first part , has become better plot average (many from him not happy , but it's nothing - yes, Oscar did not take , but not boring) , and the gameplay is addictive . Not many games give you a killing machine , where you can destroy all who will fall on the eyes . Many side missions that do not celebrate diversity , but not one-to- one with each other. Incidentally, there are some statistics that lets you compare the damage caused by you, the damage from your friends , which of course is a plus.The game not for everybody, but it is definitely worth the attention .

												I played the first Prototype (and enjoyed it) on the PS3 few years back. I thought the first game was good for the time and was hoping for a second one to be released. When I saw the advertisement for the Prototype2  I just had no reaction to it and decided to add this title to my maybe pile for the future. So when it came up on steam deals I toke a chance and got it. The game is very similar to the original in both good and bad ways, The combat feels the same which if you didn't like the first game then you won't like this. The story is mediocre at best (compared to modern standards) with no real connection with the main character, which could leave most people possibly disinterested on following the game till the end. However James Heller is a badass character himself and they could of created a much better back story for him. This may seem like I'm ripping on the game but, it falls down at most of the points it needs to hit. There are some features of the game which are original and with work (possibly in a Third Prototype game) they would have chance to shine. All in all if you liked the first one then pick this up (on a deal of course).			",69,7,0,17,0,1,15

There is two major bugs that i couldnt seem to fix through the game...one was the dioalouge and most sound was completely absent when i played on my headphones but if i set the volume to go through my tv it was fine... i tried all those techniques of changing the Hz to 44000 and 16 bit and all that and it still refused to work...another bug was that after about 20 minutes of gameplay the game would exponentially lag  and stutter around unil finally it got into single digit fps and i couldnt take it anymore and saved and quit but once i restarted the game it would go back to 60 fps fine until about another 20 min... one thing i found out a little bit later was that if i would hit the windows key and get out of the game for a second then go back in that it would be less likely to lag but i would have to do this periodically about every 5 minutes or so which is quite a nuisence. Besides those two major bugs i can still say that i had a great time playing prototype and i will continue to play just for the sandox part of it :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the junkfood of sandbox action adventures.The graphics are nothing to be astounded by, alongside the boring, repetitive enviroment. Nor should you think about the story and it's baby-eating evil cast. On those merits, this game would be terrible.BUT, what this game does well, is let you run around the streets of New York as an unstoppable monster, fighting both infected and military enemies with incerdible ease. Though the fighting can be a bit fiddly, it's fun, frantic and empowering.It's quick, dirty and cheap fun. Why not?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One thing I hate about steam reviews is the fact that people don't recommend this game because of their technical problems. I feel like Steam should do something about this, something like putting a warning on the game's store page about it so an amazing game that has issues running with certain types of hardware doesn't get pushed down to ""Mixed"" reviews.Anyway, if you can run this game, you'll see from the vast majority of the reviews that you should play it. You play as an overpowered antihero and you go around slicing and crushing anyone from innocent civilians to military. The story is pretty interesting, but overall I'd say that the main character is really the only one they got right.So if you like to jump and glide around an infected New York at ridiculous speeds to massacre anyone you want in a variety of ways, buy this game. RIP AMD users.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can remember it, this is pretty much like the first prototype.Mostly the same mechanics, but a bit more polished. Less challenge missions, and harder to fail them. Pretty much ez-mode all the way through on Normal difficulty (with only a couple of speedbumps along the way) but I honestly wouldn't recommend you play it any other way. It's a power fantasy, through and through, and that's how it plays best.Controls on keyboard & mouse are fine. A bit wonky at times, but you'll get used to them. It's a console port, so a controller is probably better if you got one. No dealbreaker though. I played through it without one easily.There's a few bugs the developers never fixed, but since it's a 4 years old title at this point random folks on the internet has already solved them for you. AMD users (allegedly) needs a registry fix to play, and there's a point in the second mission where you have to alt-tab out and set CPU affinity to just CPU 0 for a few minutes to get past a glitchy trigger-event (the Pounce Claw Attack tutorial). Other than that, I experienced no technical problems at all throughout the rest of the game (running Nvidia and Core I7).Bottom line: It's a non-stop action fest of gore and destruction for 12-14 hours.If you like action games and it's on a sale, it's absolutely worth it.

												As an AMD owner and Win 10 user here is my experience with this game.Short version: Fun as hell, just like the first game. Some bugs and glitches are present but i can tolerate that much.Long version:One key feature is the game has + difficulty setting. For example after completing the game on easy, you gain most of the powers and easy+ difficulty starts the story from the beginning with all the abilities and mutations present. So it restarts the story, not you :) Which is the most brilliant idea of this game.If you know first game and enjoyed it, you will %100 sure definitely like more or less this one too.Just like the first game, map is big enough, movement is fluid and easy, combat is fun and detailed (with less key combinations compared to the first game, so less complicated), you can drive tanks or fly helicopters, story is like the movie ""TAKEN"" :)Visually fantastic but every 20 minutes or so, the game stucks. Press Alt Tab and get back to game again and it will be corrected. It is not that big of a problem for me. But it can strike in the most exciting moment of the game.Just like the first game, after completing the story (took 8 hours in easy+ difficulty) you can challange your friends in game challanges or just create chaos in the RED ZONE.If you do not mind occasional bugs, this game is fun and diverse. Ultimate destruction and massacre :)			",103,16,21,2,17,0,18

												PROTOTYPE 2 review, TAKE 2:This may contain spoilers. If you know me personally then keep scrolling.First of all, I got this game because I wanted to see what happened after the prequel, PROTOTYPE. I really loved PROTOTYPE- a lot. It had a decent story, characters, plot and this and that. The gameplay in PROTOTYPE 2 is very similar to that of the prequel (and there's nothing wrong with that). It is nice that you can do a little more while holding someone by the neck or standing on the hatch of a tank. But aside from the pretty graphics and all that, the powers are easier to use and much more flexible to swap, but you have to completely enter and exit a disguise just to hide them rather than just hit a little bind key. And, if you actually played the first game, you may recall those old combat moves that Alex Mercer could use for different combat situations. Those features were completely wiped clean of PROTOTYPE 2's gameplay. Now, here's the story criticism:Remember that movie, Ender's Game? Remember that quote: ""In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.""? Yeah. About that... I think that the creators got just a little too lazy the the plot in this game. They took the Alex Mercer from the prequel and just made him the antagonist. Just suddenly- with no concerns, no looking back... Not many of you would care, but it still left a few gaps in the original story. It's actually pretty funny: ""I won't let you erase New York like you erased hope."" moments later, you find him killing innocents and blowing up NYC with his bio weaponry. I still find it silly how they brought us this new guy, ""Heller"", and struck him in a pit with Alex and made them kill each other. Alex was THE start of this series, and not a lot of people know that since they're just buying the ""better game"". ""KILL BAD GUY KILL BAD GUY""Yeah. The story to PROTOTYPE 2 is as simple as it is. Murder your maker. Get revenge.Yawn. Oh, who's Heller again? Nothing interesting at all, as far I can recall. (Since I actually played the first game) I found this game almost even intimidating. The reason I have so many hours on it is because I loaded a complete save and got that silly RADNET access thing so I don't have to deal with being Heller. Dear god... The way he strokes his bald scalp... You will have more fun with the prequel, PROTOTYPE. Better story, better gameplay, etc etc...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 has become one of my favorite games in my steam libary. It has good gameplay, good combat and a good story.Open world is fun and there is lots to do within the world like side quests or just kill a bunch of ♥♥♥♥.Combat is good with it's different selection of powers to use like the hammerfist or blade, there are many more powers.Story is good but i wish it could be a bit longer but it was good enough i guess.It runs 60fps smoothly on my pc.My specs are:Cpu: Intel Core i7-6700T CPU @ 2.80GHz - 3.6GHz Gpu: Gtx 960 4GB Ram: 16GB SSD: 256GB Storage Portable Hard Drive: 2TB Storage If you have any issues with the game and use a nvidia GPU, Add me and i might be able to help since my issue could not be found online ",302,18,13,34,35,5,16

												Would not recommend simply because I have to quit to desktop after every single mission due to lag. I've been looking into it all weekend and have found zero solutions. It's garbage that a game this old should be doing this and have not been fixed.If it works on your computer, it is a really fun game and I'd highly recommend it! I'm just tired of 10 FPS.

												It is basically like the first game, except a few differences:- it's a horribly broken port. It has everything from FPS issues, over bad mouse controls to random crashes on startup- the controls with a gamepad are much easier now, making the game much more comfortable to control- they took a lot of depth out of the move system, where in the first game you had to buy almost every ability you could have, from kicks, punches to your powers, there are less attacks now, which I don't like- the game is far too easy even on the hardest difficulty- the new voice actor for Alex Merver is far worse than the one from the orginal Prototype- James Heller is a moron who can't make up his mind- all the criticism aside I really like the new tendril power, but it's a shame that they didn't include the armor power from the first gameOverall I'd say it's inferior to Prototype 1, which ""only"" had a few issues with some minor mouselag and quite cryptic controls.

Keep in mind, the beginning is a little slower, but after a few levels you'll feel nearly invincible.

												9/10In the gore and blood honored tradition of the original, this game puts you in as a beast.  Just running and jumping around causes tons of collateral damage.  I leap off a building and surfed on some guy walking down the street leaving a gib laced bloody path.  Then I spent my first hour throwing people off the top of a building or into other buildings, splatting on impact like giant flies being swatted by gravity.  The game starts you with spiderman-like abilities and you only progress from there.  Absorb bosses and incorporate them.  BE the gvirus Tyrant, but with a better heart and conviction of purpose than William Burken.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty awesome game!Ignore the people that hate the game because it won't load. AMD graphics cards aren't consistent, so any good graphics games (not just Prototype 2) will run like crap.Anyways on to the actual review -Presentation: The storyline is interesting, but Heller's constant anger causes a lack of character development. The cutscenes are very unique and finding locations in the map is fairly easy.Graphics: The graphics are pretty good, but they seem kind of old style. I think of Assassins creed 3/AC Brotherhood when i see the graphics.Sound: A lot of commotion goes on and honestly some of the stuff gets annoying to hear, but nothing beats hearing the sound of your enemy getting ripped in half.Gameplay: Your character is a badass which is what makes me addicted to this game. It's extremely entertaining to blow up helicopters and just kill everything. The only complaint is that you need the DLC to get 100% on the storyline.Lasting Appeal: The campaign isn't too long, but you'll stay busy with all the side missions and collectibes scattered everywhere.

												The core idea and story are great, especially for someone like me, a fan of horror films like Carpenter's The Thing, and someone who's always liked the idea of playing the monster in a game (whether misunderstood or just plain monstrous).They've continued the interesting atmospheric world from the first game, where the military is brutal and uncaring as a whole, the corporations are greedy and amoral, but both contain sympathetic and helpful individuals.And the gameplay is fairly simple, but somewhat challenging (at least on hard difficulty), and very good at making you feel like you're the evolved, shapeshifting, deadly soldier James Heller.Note that my longer list of CONS below just indicates that I saw lots of room for improvement... but I still enjoyed the game.PROS:- Great story.- A rare offering in a genre without many contenders.- Some beautiful, visceral attack effects.- Fun if simple gameplay.CONS:- The end battle really undoes the playstyle you develop through the rest of the game, sort of making you learn a new game.- Littered with sexism and anti-intellectualism... and not all of it can be chalked up to ""But that's just how this character thinks."" Some of it is fundamental to the game's overall outlook.- Some of the textures and modelling from the main game are too low-res for the in-game cutscenes. In those cases, they look awful.- Not as sandbox-y as the first game.- Character skills/customization is fairly broad and doesn't really let you specialize too much. So by late game, your character will play pretty much the same as any other playthrough.- As a result of the above two points: not much replayability.Rating: 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone who's played this game (as well as the first one) repetitively on console, I can confirm that, even with a rig that plays Battlefield 4 efficiently, and even with this game at LOW settings, the PC port for P2 is literally broken.  There are framerate drop issues everywhere, the main character doesn't even load at times (as if you're running around with an invisible man), and the game freezes when you use your Viral Sonar, which you acquire near the beginning of the game.I DO Recommend this game! However.... If you really wanna play this game, get it on console.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My only true gripe is the excessive overuse of the F word.   This isn't Hollywood...but it's also not the only game to follow in this disturbing trend.Fun nonetheless. 8/10!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay-wise, this game is brilliant. It has the occasionaly problem with awkward camera angles, and an over-reliance on QTE's at a certain critical point, but, for the most part? It's a good sandbox game - the fighting is awesome, and even just moving around the map is fun.Story-wise, however... not so good. Right off the bat, fans of the original Prototype will mostly be alienated due to the protagonist of the original game apparently having gone genocidal at some point off screen - that's not a spoiler, by the way; it was in the advertising material.The characters... aren't. They are two dimensional archetypes, and two of the three times in the whole game we see someone act outside their archetype, it just feels wrong. I honestly have more of a connection with Mercer, and I'm not entirely sure if that isn't because I have him confused for the character I played in Prototype 1.Then there's the ending. Now, I get they had to leave it open for a sequel, but there is no sense of resolution. You can almost literally hear the dev's shrugging and saying 'We've kinda run out of ideas now'. It is beyond anti-climactic.So, in summary? Just play the first game again. The mechanics here aren't that much of an improvement, there's certain types of minigame missing, and you won't waste your time on a story that is bland at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really Fun Game.I recommend very highly for Newbie gamers. This game is so easy on easy settings that you avoid the frustration that comes from trying to beat more difficult games.Runs perfectly on my Rig.I7-4790 CPUNvidia GTX-980 TI32gb RamSteam Controller doesn't work with this game. It was made for the Xbox 360 Controller. Didn't matter because I've been meaning to learn how to play games with Keyboard and Mouse. although I may pick up an Xbox 360 Controller just e to see the difference.You are almost invincible and it's a twisted satisfying game.There is some crude language but that's Ok with me although the Puritan Types might not like it.Overall I recommend it for Mindless fun!

												The game was a lot of fun. I find it particularly refreshing when a sequel is not just an imitation of the original game, but actually a new game altogether. I played Prototype2 immediately after Prototype 1 and the experience was completely different and, in my opinion, better. The controls felt a lot smoother in this one, the mechanics were more intuitive, hunting collectibles was actually achievable AND the rewards per collectible set were actually significant. The story was pretty nice too. The city looked particularly good, especially the red zone, with some really cool loooking damage to some of the buildings. I was hoping to witness some of that damage actually getting inflicted on some of the unharmed buildings, or some of that cool damage getting worse in an awesome cinematic of awesomeness and it didn't happen, but hey, that is a pretty small thing to complain about, which, once again, goes to show that it is a really good and fun game.

From its smooth, high action game play to its fantastic graphics and story. A must play for all of the folks that love to be the uber badass antihero. Even on the hardest difficulty, it makes the game more entertaining and satisfying. A definite must play.

												Solid game, really improves on what the first Prototype was doing. Stories nothing amazing, but engaging enough. The action gets crazy at times with some seriously fast paced gameplay with smooth combat that mirrors the first but considerably more adaptive to situations given a nice and simple UI. It really emphasizes using various abilities in different encounters and the reward is there after you chop your way through several hundred infected, military and Blacksomething ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.It's also an excellent murder simulator.Pros:-Smooth like warm butter-Improves in just about every way over the original Protoype-Boss fights do what a boss fight is meant to do and that's test you on what you've learned so far-Big map with plenty to do. Side missions manage to not be repetitive.-Great UI for real fast ability changes-Some of the radio chatter is solid dark humor-Fun travel around a fairly large map with some variation between the three play areasCons:-The game does kind of hand out upgrades like candy from a windowless panel van just for doing a few sidemissions here and there-Combat can still be a bit clunky when there are a high amount of larger units being engaged-Heller, the character you play as, is about as interesting as a warm bag of moldy potatoes-You can become considerably overpowered late game, barring end game fightsGame runs fine on Windows 10, highest settings for this system on a 1080 screen, I'll put my system specs for comparison.MS-7850Intel Core i5-4670k 3.4GHz (4CPUs) overclocked @4.3GHz12288MB RAM (12GB RAM)EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB			",119,5,0,20,19,0,25

												The game is as good as I remember. ohhh I played it on xbox360 years ago, it was good its a continuation of Alex Mercer story, but thru another new character who gets infected with Mercer virus. I wish there was a sequel of prototype 2 but its just a dream. Cause it has a good driven plot and unique characters plus a lot of cool ideas could have been created with the concept of this type of gameplay and story.The game ran perfectly for me 10/10 everything maxed out.James Heller:When I returned from a war overseas, I had lost everything. I battled my way into the heart of the Red Zone, taking out hundreds of them. Truth is, I went there to die. But someone had other plans, then I discovered the truth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really fun game if you can get past how stupid and unlikeable every single character in the game is.The open-world movement is lots of fun, combat is quite fluid and easy, and the game generally looks quite nice.You can eat innocent civilians for health, or just openly murder them without penalties, and all of the enemies in the game are part of a giant ""conspiracy"" to test viruses on the citizens of New York. There are literally thousands of soldiers and scientists that are in on it, which makes the conspiracy about as unbelieveable as is humanly possible. The main character is a ""badass"" in a sort of ""we made a 10 year-old the lead writer"" kind of way.Despite all of that, this game is lots of fun. I didn't have memory leak problems, but also have 16 GB RAM, so I can't comment on people with frequent slowdown. I think the game looks like any other last-generation-to-pc-port. Higher resolutions, much better draw distance, more shadows, etc, but in reality an engine that doesn't try to do too much.I'm having a great time 4-5 hours in, and it feels like i'm about halfway done the main story. If you like the game, get the ""Radnet"" DLC. It adds a bunch of fun challenges to the map - should really be included in the main game, but has no plot and is really just a bunch of superhero sports to try out.			",563,110,12,60,30,4,70

												Visceral, action filled and full of the satisfying dismemberment of the poor sods who get in the way of of a virtually indomitable superhuman consumed by a biological virus. It's an open world game in the spirit of the classic 'Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction' on the original Xbox. Set in the aftermath of the first game, yet again NYC becomes the victim of a biological apocalpyse set off by Alex Mercer dragging in Gentek and Blackwatch. Mercer infects a soldier, Heller, who develops the powers of his protege as he goes on a rampage killing anything and everything from both sides of the conflict in a quest for revenge for his daughter. The free roam mechanics in this game are without question the best out of any game I've played. It is simply satisfying to run at superhuman through the war torn streets of New York, leaping up the sides of skycrapers and cruising along them then jumping and gliding high above the conflict. The sense of weight and power you carry without feeling cumbersome or bulky is just nailed, you look and feel like a lithe, dealdly human predator. Story and side missions along with the usual collectilbes are scattered around the map, which is split into 3 seperate parts. While I lost the sense of a large city I got from the first, it let all the elements of the map have personality, which is a tradeoff I'm willing to take. The weapons and upgrades are disappointedly almost the same as number one with only a few differences. They are all still visually impressive and satisfying, but I held expectations for a more substantial roster of weapon options. The combat and movements mechanics are likewise similar with a familiar set of enemies, with just enough changes to justify its existence as a new game. The Evolved are quite cool though, plus it provides an enemy that plays and operates similar to yourself. The difficulty level is quite easy once you have a few upgrades, the tools at your disposal allow you to ignore or avoid almost all incoming damage sources. My first playthough on hard was very straightforward.Prototype 2 is not the best game ever. I haven't even bothered to review the story, because there's really nothing to say. It's passable if that, but it does its job in giving you a reason to tear though a collapsing city under siege. There isn't the greatest expansion in concepts from the first game, but enough to add some mild spice. Despite this, Prototype 2 is fun. It's simply fun, the core gameplay is nailed down so very well, fun is all a game needs to be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked the original Prototype then you'll most likely enjoy the sequel. It's more or less the same game with upped graphics, improved mechanics and the return of a boundless feeling of freedom.Without spoiling much, the story continues some time after the first game's events, with New York separated into zones in regards of infection levels. The virus spread has been publicly blamed on Alex Mercer by Blackwatch Forces, who now control the city zones. The story this time focuses on Sgt James Heller, whose family was killed by collateral during the infection spread while he was on duty. Blaming Mercer, he joins up with the local militia to patrol the badly infected red zone, only to be attacked by mutants and eventually by Mercer himself. His unit dead, Heller chases Mercer, who overpowers and mutates Heller. The mutation changes Heller into the same thing as Mercer and after passing out, he gets promptly picked up by Blackwatch into their labs. Some medical tests later, Heller regains consciousness and is right away forced into field testing against infected subjects. He does too well and breaks out, to be confronted by Mercer again, who tells him that this time the infection is being spread by Blackwatch as controlled bio weapons tests, with no regard for the city's inhabitants. After confirming with Mercer that he had nothing to do with his family's death, Heller reluctantly joins up for the cause.The game generally plays exactly the same way as the previous one, you get a sandbox of a city to explore, however this time you get three islands to explore instead of one, each one named as Red, Yellow and Green zones, in regards of how safe they are from infection. The stealth system has been improved with better warnings and less chance to screw up and blow your cover. You still evolve your abilities and learn more about behind the scenes story by consuming select people and mutants. The collectibles have been also reduced and are much easier to find on your own (Just remembering how the first game wanted you to find all landmarks brings uneasy memories). The mutation has been modified however from spending points, to simple leveling with assigning a point into what skill you want to advance. Other abilities and enhancements are learned by finding enough collectibles, hindering Blackwatch research and destroying Infested Lairs.The visuals have gotten an upgrade, not a major one, but enough to ensure that the game still runs smoothly, as loads of things are going on all the time. The cutscenes are presented in a stylistic black, white and red, which the game also goes into when you're low on health. The story carries on the same theme of showing humanity at its worst, making one wonder who the true monsters are.In general, I enjoyed this game as much as I did the first one. I really like the feeling of freedom it provides as you run, jump and glide through the massive city. The action can be overwhelming at times, but if you play it smart, and utilise everything given to you, you can bring down any opposition. The game is not too massive, not too long and not too short, with plenty to do throughout. The achievements and challenges, while sometimes hard, are not impossible to complete and I'll probably pick this game up once again and attempt the hard or insane mode.			",522,218,5,44,48,5,75

												great game, if you did enjoy the 1st prototype you will probably like this one, everything is improved: better visuals, easier controls, even more insane ways to defeat your ennemies, kinda dramatic storyline. The only minus i remember from the days i was through it is that side quests aren't so numberous and various as i would love to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely a letdown. After beating prototype one I was super hyped to play this one but it just doesn’t live up to the hype :/ If they had left prototype one’s gameplay the same and just added new events and better graphics, prototype two would have been my number one favorite game but instead it just sits in my steam library unfinished… Do not buy full price, I got it for 10 dollars on a steam sale. If possible just skip it all together and just replay prototype one and read the wiki on two.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 is so utterly ridiculous that it's hard to wipe the smile from your face. It starts out weak but ends SO MUCH, much stronger, although its missions and storyline never really rise to a level beyond “enjoyable.” Even so, it’s enormously fun as an open-world playground, especially once all of Heller’s powers are at your disposal; there are always fun ways to experiment, to cause horrific violence and to watch the hapless pedestrians scatter. If you’re looking for an epic, hugely varied adventure, look elsewhere, but if you want a game that lets you run amok in creative, bloody ways, Prototype 2 is pretty incredible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, i will be brief. Prototype 2 is the sequel to Prototype (1). On my opinion its good game. Brutal, action adventure where you can upgrade your character and his incredible skills. Open world in destroyed New York..Arhhh..YES..It is actually good environment for myself. Lot of people say that have boring campain. Yes, for begginer this can be ""nothing much"". I am fan of this series, but it has some ""errors"". P2 giving new and new abilities and ways how kill someone with STYLE, but lot of these just lost. I liked in P1 feeling, i was an original. In P2 developers made lot of mistakes and P2 is story about ""stupid superhumans"" with ""SAME"" (always easy to kill them) skills. Yes, P2 has very easy difficulty, something is happening on HARD or INSANE diff....But i still LOVE this game and this little ""errors"" don't make me to hate this game.. I really recommending this game. <3+ grafic+ gameplay+ quite creative+ environment and size of map + character- enemies- difficulty- some missions ( just hunt and then consume or kill your target)- length of story, you can finish story in 4-5 hours (without bonus missions)MY REVIEW - 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can't really recommend getting this on PC. The controls are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥when playing with keyb+mouse.The game itself is full of males stinking with testosterone. Cursewords fly around faster than bullets and characters don't seem to have any depth at all.The graphics are horrible for a game released in summer 2012. Textures are low-quality even at the highest settings.And the blood. Every time you hit anyone you hit a conveniently placed 2 liter blood pack. Amazing how these poor people can afford hiding several of those under their clothes.The AI kinda sucks too. Soldiers can't tell if you're infected even though you just fell down 50 meters, broke the pavement, and walked away unharmed.After all the rant I will still probably play this through but it totally is not worth it's price.

												CONI'm not a huge fan of games where they tell you whom to play. That said, that's my main grudge against P2 -- you can't really choose what your character looks like, what his backstory is, etc. etc., and the fact that like in P1, it isn't really anyone too likeable doesn't help.The control scheme now lets you choose two active powers versus Prototype 1's one, and while that sounds nice (especially the option to assign a slow move and a fast move, or a close range one and a long-range / area one), I didn't really find it all that useful in the game (I would assign one fast, close range attack as primary power and use it 95 % of the time, and have something like tendrils -- or later whip fist -- as a secondary for the rare cases where I needed to attack a helicopter or needed an area effect. Using each roughly 50 % for great synergy? Not so much. But maybe, that was just me.).The downside is that while you get twice as many active skills, you have to handle them with the same number of buttons on the controller, and the controls feel less precise than in P1. Ironically, the most annoying issue wasn't even attack related; if you don't get quite the right attack, but still an attack, it's usually non-catastrophic. What I did get often enough for it to be a nuisance however was being on a stealth mission, pressing (B) to interact with some hapless soldier (usually to consume them and gain their memories; sometimes just to stop him keeping an eye on the person you came for), and instead prying lose some feature of the landscape that also happened to be close (but didn't even necessarily look like you could interact with it). And well, prying lose random ACs or oiltanks or whatever automatically raises an alert and ruins the stealth part of your mission. (This can also be an issue during melee, where you get a prompt to press (B) to consume an enemy who's been weakened enough, but who may die soon, and where in crowded locations (B) will then often select bystanders seemingly at random, all while your actual target is bleeding out.I liked the skill system in P1 better (get XP for everything, then once you have enough XP to improve whatever skill you're interested in (i.e. buy many minor things quickly, or save up for big improvements)) vs P2's ""you'll level up again at so-and-so many XP, and every time you do, you can improve exactly one skill"", but in the end, it wasn't a huge factor.(That said, the thing where you can get a skill buy eating the brain of someone who has it still exists.)PROUnsurprisingly, the city looks much better than in P1; the player character looks much better, the voice acting is decent this time, and most of all, while there are certainly repetitive elements (mostly the Blacknet assassinations, which often don't have much in the way of plot -- this is even lampshaded one time: ""So this guy is an APC driver? Doesn't really sound like a big bad mover and shaker ... ah, whatever, I'll kill him anyway.""), the game, especially the main quest, feels much more like a story than the first game did at the best of times, and a sense of urgency is upheld at (almost) all times. Like a soap opera or Baking Bread, it isn't necessarily the cleverest plot on earth, but each mission creates enough of a cliffhanger to make you wonder what will happen next, and it's tremendously easy to get sucked into ""just one more mission before bed.""As a bonus, much of the optional ""color"" of the setting is now told through audio logs you can find (and listen to while you move along), rather than flickering memories with corny visuals that don't really blend with the rest of the game and that interrupt your flow like in P1. Small change, surprisingly big effect. (Technically I guess they're a cross between the landmark orbs and the ""color"" memories of P1, but I played P1 and P2 in the same week, so it's becoming a bit of a blur.)There are challenges and mini-games and somewhat repetitive kill zones, but unlike in Saints Row IV, they're not mandatory -- you can do one once in a while for variety or XP, or do them after the main quest for something to do with your then near maxed-out powers. Or, you can ignore them completely, and just do the main quest. Your choice.The gliding, especially once upgraded, still won't carry you as far as SR IV's, but it feels world's away from P1's, which never felt much better than plain old falling.A big plus: Starting maybe 2/3 in, P1 would just try to overwhelm you -- gliding was practically useless, perhaps in an attempt to keep you at street level, and at street level, there'd be a constant barrage -- even if for once, zombies weren't attacking you and soldiers weren't detecting you, you'd frequently ragdoll all over the place simply for getting caught in random crossfire of the marines or blackwatch using tanks and rockets at street level. Yes, it sounds good on paper -- getting swarmed is obviously very much a zombie trope, and the careless use of artillery demonstrated desperation / casual disregard for any survivors, but in reality, it just makes for a really unfun game mechanic when the true challenge of a misison isn't Doing The Thing, but getting there to do the thing. Meh. (This was exacerbated by the fact that using any speed powers could get a strike team called on you.)  In P2, you get caught in the cross fire much less easily, you don't get swarmed by the zombies as much, strike teams aren't called in as easily, take longer to arrive, are easier to shake off, and are easier to kill. Heck, it's almost too easy in P2, but I'll take that over P1's traversing the city being a chore any day. P2 has ""joy of movement!"" :)RECOMMENDATIONIf you can stomach playing a character that they picked, rather than one that you picked, give it a go, especially if you've played part one, but get it while it's on sale. (It seems pretty much too late to vote with your dollar anyway, now that they've already downsized Radical -- which is actually a shame, I would've been interested in seeing how a Prototype 3 would've come out.)

												I loved the first prototype game (recommended!!!)! Before i start to break it down, if you liked the first game, you are gonne injoy this one too. The basics are the same, slightly differend powers, do mission and destroy things to increase your abilities.What makes this game so bad, i haven't been playing this in years because of its instability. If you don't have the specific hardware they recommend, be prepaired for a lots of crashes, if you get it to work at all. Game support has never solved the tens of thousands complaints about these problems. For that reason alone, i don't recommend bying this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 I couldn't get passed 15 minutes into the game because the quest would bug out. I've restarted the game (fresh restart) twice now, restarted the mission a few times and did the same for the checkpoint. I'm sorry, but this is a title I cannot recommend based on my personal experience of the game, therefore, I cannot go into greater detail about the game because 15 minutes is not an accurate review. Bugged Quest: This is when the main organization does something bad in a set location (not giving away spoilers) and you need to pounce on this soldier. Well, I press 3 for the claw, and then I press R to target the soldier(s), and hold the left mouse button to engage the fight sequence. I kill all of them and the quest fails to continue.

												I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would.  However I did have that glitch early in the game that required me to set my CPU to one core in order to move on in the story, but quickly changed it back to all 4 cores.The 10 hour single player game is worth the price if you like Third Person open world action games.  The game ran smooth with 50+ monsters, helicopters, tanks, soldiers, and stuff flying everywhere.  Running around, flying, and parkour all was smooth/fun.You can pick up guns, do side quests to beef up your char, or just cause massive damage to an area.  It has a bit of stealth as well, but mostly not required.  The story is just your typical - Rough tough good guy smashing bad guys and getting tricked along the way, but every hour or so you get a new method of attacking and killing so I kept rolling forward.If you want a GTA Meets Superman, but with Zombies/Monsters/Big Cities then this is the game for you.  Just don't expect anything more than a fun smash and bash action game.Would play again if I didn't have so many other games to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 is a highly adictive kill everbody you see type of game. However lots of other people say Prototype is better and by playing both games and watching videos. Prototype 1 Is far better. I enjoy this game a lot because it fun go around and throw people into others but this game is flawed.1. Im not sure if im the only one but my Quad-core 3.2 Ghz, 12gb of ram and a Saphire Radeon 7850 2GB setup had real troubles being able to load certain areas in-game, mainly indoor areas.2. The Character is Bland. He's just your generic army black dude.3. The Tutorial is way too in your face and stops game play to explain stuff which it really doesn't need too.4. The animation during in-game cutscenes are very robotic in the sense that they feel very Playstation 2 like.Despite all this, the game is still really enjoyable. Being able to cause havoc in any area you wish is all ways fun, and being able to run around the whole map at nice speeds to where-ever you wish whilst carrying most cars, bins or people to the top of a tall skyscrapper. The story in most games I never really pay attention to but this one I did and I think the story isn't that bad. Without any spoilers, the main character gets the Alex Mercer virus and discovers that the people he thought were trying to help every-one were the people causing the outbreak. So you go and take down main people in both GenTek and Blackwatch to discover more.So, in MY opinion this game is extremly fun but prehaps not worth the £20 or whatever it is in the US. Do pick this game up if it ever gets a discount. It's definetaly worth it.			",102,9,2,8,10,0,3

												Let's get straight to the point: Prototype 2 is the better game compared to its predecessor. It's practically the same game, with a different main character, some RPG elements, and improved graphics. Now, it does run poorer. As in; the framerate is unstable. Where Prototype 1 gave you a solid 60FPS, P2 gives us anything ranging from 30 to 60+. It's definitely playable, but it's not the smoothest experience. There are a lot of sidemissions, many of them better and with more variation and the carnage remains the same, which is excellent and fast. By completing certain objectives (consuming people, destroying lairs, etc) you'll gain XP points. With every level you gain you'll unlock a power in a certain category. This depends on the mission/objective you completed. It works really well. And where the first game had way too many moves, this one has just enough and they're easy to pull off as well. Another improvement is the fact that stealth consuming is made more easier. Fun fun fun ![Rating: 92/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll have to admit that I never played the first PROTOTYPE even though I own it since I found the controls to be horrible. Luckily, it's been fixed in this successor. Controls are okay in this game. You will jump in the wrong direction every now and then but it's not too annoying. Graphics as well as sound are at least decent. And now the most important part: Gameplay.The devs did a great job here in my opinion. The missions are motivating and fun. Sadly, they are a bit repetitive as well. A good thing as well is the fact that you are being rewarded for doing the whole collectible stuff. This should be mandatory in every game including those. tl;dr: A great Open World game. If you don't feel like playing games like Saint's Row or GTAV, you may definitely grab this title in a sale since it's great fun for a couple of hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As others have put it elsewhere, you basically get to be Carnage in a various-states-of-mayhem New York City (known as New York Zero following the events of the first game). Heller isn't ""homicidal madman"" like Carnage, though, but it's still super fun to play with the mutation powers. If you've played the first, you'll basically ease right in to the second - it's honestly been years since I played the original, but I felt more or less right at home (after a little bit of keybind switching, it's basically just as I remember it). Mechanically, bases are only infiltrated within the context of missions (story and side), and lairs are one-and-done deals, unlike in the first game where both enemy building types could manifest at predetermined sites throughout the world. The Web of Intrigue is done away with, but you still consume named individuals and view their memories. This time around, though, individuals are tied to //BLACKWATCH missions most of the time, and you get an ability to hunt down these individuals (versus mostly running around the city and praying for the target to spawn), making things FAR less of a hassle in that department.As I recall, Musclemass isn't a thing in this installment as it was in the first one, but you do get the Tendril power which is plenty of fun on its own (though it kind of makes me think of using Lanky Kong's melee attacks in DK64). Every other power feels very satisfying to use and pretty viable the entire game through.Overall, pretty good when on sale - turn your brain off, though, because it's not necessarily top-notch in terms of writing, character development, or voice acting. But then again, that can make it feel like a cheesy horror-ish actiony B-movie, so that can work in its favour. It's worth a few afternoons of play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 is much better than the first game almost in every way. They healed the wounds of the first game with this one. PROS:+ A better protagonist than Alex Mercer in every way. + Great voice acting.+ Story and story telling is much better than the first game. Unlike the first game, it feels like there is a story.+ Combat system is much better than the first game. + Heller's sense of humour is hilarious. He made me laugh too many times. CONS:- Gameplay was much better in first game. - Less diversity compared to first one.			",565,97,17,41,29,3,31

												New York has been devastated by hideous mutative virus and the only hope for at least a somewhat happy outcome is a soldier wracked with PTSD, visions of his lost family and on a quest for vengeance… Oh and he is literally an indestructible super mutant. Sound fun? Then you should get this game.Now where to start, this game is more fun than a barrel full of radioactive plague monkeys hopped up on Vicodin. This game takes place a few years after the events of the first title, knowledge of which is not needed as you get a history lesson almost immediately before getting infected with the super virus that turns you into a freaking super hero… of death I guess.The game offers you three large open worlds to explore, each representing a portion of New York city and each very different in their own way. If you’ve seen NY then you will know your way around. Yellow zone is a huge slum where the oppressive totalitarian Government crushes all under boot, the green zone is… well much the same as NY now but the red zone, that’s where it’s at. Huge packs of rabid mutants roam the streets, the buildings toppled and destroyed. I loved that place.The combat is one of the best parts of this or any other game. As mentioned you are a super hero, sorta. You can fly, jump over skyscrapers rip people in half, hurl tanks into other tanks and all that cool stuff. Not only that but you come with more blades than a Swiss army knife and each one of deadly powers is so much fun to use. My fav was infection citizens and turning them into living goop bombs before lobbing them at passers-by and watching the carnage. This game makes you feel like a bad a.s.s, the most bad a.s.sed bad a.s.s that ever roamed the streets of NYC. With your array of powers you could destroy entire armies or mutants and humans alike. Slicing, dicing and smashing them to bits before transforming into someone else and walking away as if nothing’s happened. This game gives you the power to be anyone; You just have to consume them. That’s right, your powers health and abilities rely on how many people you can eat using your tentacles. All of the things you can possibly imagine are given to you via a large tech tree and levelling system.Not only can you use your bare hands to deal a lot of damage there are also vehicles in this game too. Tanks, helicopters and..… Well not many different vehicles but each one can blow the heck out of anything infront of it. You can also utilize your enemies weapons, slicing someone apart and then blowing up his friends with his grenade launcher, classic.The story is great too, a man’s tale of vengeance, betrayal and hope lead him to save the world from a psychopath hell bent on forcing humanities evolution. Also there is a government conspiracy in there somewhere. The characters are great and I felt really connected to the protagonist, just like everyone else he absorbs. The music was good, not great but it served its purpose. There are a ton of collectables that offer a nice amount of back story and hidden information and I had a good time tracking them all down.This game is awesome; there is a lot of enjoyment to be had. It is not overly long even though its open world but what’s there will entertain you for hours. Plus if you are anything like me the pure gory death you inflict on others is enough to get me hooked. Buy this allday anyday and you will not be diapointed.Have Fun ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												when it comes to Prtototype 2 i have mixed feelings...on the one hand: +we have a great story +nice game mechanics +a fun and kinda unique way to ,literally, run around the whole map +a well designed hack and slash all in allon the other hand: -THIS GAME IS SOOO BADLY AND POORLY PORTED TO THE PC-VERSIONmany people complain about start up crashes and such things. my problem was that if i wanted to watch a cutscene ingame i was caught in an endless loading screen afterwards and needed to restart the game. So I was forced to skip all cutscenes in order to avoid it and watch them in a seperate video on youtube... that is really a huge downside since the story is good and also playing a mission without any backround is just slayin some mutants.So i can recommend the game to everybody who likes open world or hack n slay games but you need to be patient with all the hickups the PC version contains and because of all the problems only buy it in a sale if you are interested.IF you have the possibility, play it on a console.

												Awesome action game, best played with a controller IMO. Just jumping around the city can be fun on it's own, combine that with ridiculous power and upgradeable moves and you will have a good time. Story is easy to follow but I didn't care much for the characters, I much preffered jumping off a roof and then tossing  a car on a group of people. Third person, super here style action, melee and guns, fun boss fights and all around solid action game. This is one of those titles that you can just jump in and mindless wreck stuff for a hour, very satisfying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't usually really like open-world cityscape games, but this keeps a tight focus on giving you an arc of getting new abilities and then using them for a while, and moving on. The only real ""open world"" aspect is to go collect powerups, which can all be found with minimal hairpulling, which is greatly appreciated.Ultimately this game is a solid beat-em-up, with some sandbox elements; don't expect a lot of variety in terms of alternative things to do. It can be a little samey and drag as you approach the end, but you want to forgive it because the core gameplay usually feels good, and gives you so many options when trying to figure out how to smash through a set of enemies with as much health remaining as possible. It's very clear that they refined the combat system rather than throw on random minigame distractions, and I appreciate the game's sense of focus.I can't recommend it at $40 but if you can get it heavily discounted then it's definitely worth your time.

												Loads and loads of fun. Prototype 2 took the lessons learned in Prorotype and distilled all of the most intensely fun parts into a new game. Heller is a superb protagonist, and I found myself chuckling at his snide remarks more than a few times. The powers and unlocking were all streamlined from the original. Mercer transitioned perfectly from protagonist to antagonist, and it's beautiful how in-your-face he is right off the start. It really makes the climax that much more intense. Only criticism was that the difficulty felt a bit low. The only time I really felt any pushback was on the final Mercer fight. The rest of the game makes you feel like some kind of symbiote-deity. And that's totally all right. In conclusion, it is a fitting sequel which surpasses the original. Well worth the buy.			",228,18,4,29,14,2,13

												A sandbox isn't very fun without toys. For the FULL version of Prototype 2 you need to buy the RADNET DLC. A big chunk of the oritinal Prototype elements werer ripped out and are only available in a DLC. These include most of the non-storyline distractions. So, no foot races, rampage type challenges, etc. Not unless you buy the DLC.Otherwise it's a good game, but it was an unwelcome suprise to find afterword that this is the main story and ONLY the main story.

												Its actually alot of fun.The game suffers from repetetive gameplay sometimes and the acting is pretty laughable, but those are the only issues the stick up for me.Most of the time your just having fun running around with rediculous abilities smashing and cutting and eating everybody.Not alot of games just give you that video game freedom feel anymore, this one holds up alright.

												Came over to PC from PS3 and/or PS4 like me? Looking for a game similar in gameplay and setting to the inFAMOUS games with an open world and super power abilities? Then I highly recommend this!Even though the combat can feel a bit clunky at times, it's still a pretty good super powers/open world game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As for my part, the gameplay itself was absolutely amazing.The story was quite decent, certainly not a masterpiece, but still enjoyable.But this game contains so many bugs that lead to regularly occuring crashes and bugs,which all lead to you having to restart the game and playing from the last activated checkpoints.All I can say is this: If you're in only for the parkour, I'd go for it.But if you actually wanted to play this for the game itself (e.g. story), I'd recommend playing something else.

												It has nicer graphics than the first one. Other than that the first one is much better. It can't capture the same excitment and feeling of the first one so its a miss really. I have the first one for Xbox 360.If you know Disney movies you probably know what to think of them when there's a 2 in their name. The same applies here. More of the same with degrading quality.

												TL;DR - Game is really good, but there's a chance it won't work.The game itself is amazing, it follows on from 1 in terms of hype and gameplay really well, unfortunately like many of the other negative reviews you'll read on here it doesn't launch. It stalls for a little bit on a black screen and then exits. Oddly enough though one random time I decided to try launching it, it worked perfectly. I completed it in that week while it was still launching alright, then I forgot about it for a while, and when I tried to return to 100% it, it's back to the same old issue.Mainly treat this review as a ""buyer-beware"" - If the game will run for you it's fantastic and well worth playing especially if you're a fan of prototype 1. If it doesn't, there's no fix that I've found that's worked, so you'll have just wasted your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely Great Game!! Yes I have to admit it is ""dumbed downed"" from the last game, the mainquest and sidequests are easier than the last game and most of your powers and moves dont have a negative trade-off, but the overall fun of game over shadows the weaknesses it has. The graphics are beautiful, everything is sharp and very detailed. The game's focus is on powers and they are just super fun to use. The map is three times bigger than the last game because it includes two other islands to explore. The boss battles are the best part of this game because of their intensity and that compared to the last game instead of upgrading to get powers you get powers by killed a boss. I really recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed the last game and just general sandbox, destruction, powers, mutants type of game.There seemed to be a memory glitch thing going around but i didn't expeirence it.I used a nvidia geforce gtx 670 to play this game.Recommended++++			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome action game, best played with a controller IMO. Just jumping around the city can be fun on it's own, combine that with ridiculous power and upgradeable moves and you will have a good time. Story is easy to follow but I didn't care much for the characters, I much preffered jumping off a roof and then tossing  a car on a group of people. Third person, super here style action, melee and guns, fun boss fights and all around solid action game. This is one of those titles that you can just jump in and mindless wreck stuff for a hour, very satisfying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't usually really like open-world cityscape games, but this keeps a tight focus on giving you an arc of getting new abilities and then using them for a while, and moving on. The only real ""open world"" aspect is to go collect powerups, which can all be found with minimal hairpulling, which is greatly appreciated.Ultimately this game is a solid beat-em-up, with some sandbox elements; don't expect a lot of variety in terms of alternative things to do. It can be a little samey and drag as you approach the end, but you want to forgive it because the core gameplay usually feels good, and gives you so many options when trying to figure out how to smash through a set of enemies with as much health remaining as possible. It's very clear that they refined the combat system rather than throw on random minigame distractions, and I appreciate the game's sense of focus.I can't recommend it at $40 but if you can get it heavily discounted then it's definitely worth your time.

												Loads and loads of fun. Prototype 2 took the lessons learned in Prorotype and distilled all of the most intensely fun parts into a new game. Heller is a superb protagonist, and I found myself chuckling at his snide remarks more than a few times. The powers and unlocking were all streamlined from the original. Mercer transitioned perfectly from protagonist to antagonist, and it's beautiful how in-your-face he is right off the start. It really makes the climax that much more intense. Only criticism was that the difficulty felt a bit low. The only time I really felt any pushback was on the final Mercer fight. The rest of the game makes you feel like some kind of symbiote-deity. And that's totally all right. In conclusion, it is a fitting sequel which surpasses the original. Well worth the buy.			",228,18,4,29,14,2,13

												I don't understand why this game has mixed reviews. I played this game on console for many hours, so I know what I'm talking about, I just recently got it on pc though. Not only is this game extremely fun and there are endless ways to take out enemies, you literally feel like you're unstoppable. You get many upgrades to your character, new weapons, and a pretty good story. It's extremely gory, so people who like gory games, this is for you. Even when you finish the game, you can still play it and have a good time. Also a good game to play if you're angry lol. I guess the one thing I could say that makes this game negative, is it is really easy. Some might like that, but some others like a challenge when they play, and even on the normal difficulty, difficulties definitely don't surpass the easy parts. Again, some might like it, some might not. Depends on what kind of player you are. Overall: 8.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sandbox isn't very fun without toys. For the FULL version of Prototype 2 you need to buy the RADNET DLC. A big chunk of the oritinal Prototype elements werer ripped out and are only available in a DLC. These include most of the non-storyline distractions. So, no foot races, rampage type challenges, etc. Not unless you buy the DLC.Otherwise it's a good game, but it was an unwelcome suprise to find afterword that this is the main story and ONLY the main story.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU OWN WINDOWS 10.  I bought this a couple of years ago and promptly forgot all about it. I came across it a few days ago and decided to play it.......nope. You launch the game as you would any other from steam but instead of the game loading you are met with a black screen that lasts for around 5 seconds and then the game crashes. There are literally hundreds of posts, both on steam and elsewhere, that try to fix this issue and whilst some suggestions work for some people none of them work for me at all - which is why I cannot do a proper review of this game. I tried to goto Activision support but they no longer have a support page for this game at all and the Devs behind this (Radical Entertainment) have shut down so there is no way to fix this issue if you are unlucky enough to encounter it.I have arouns 5 mins logged as game time but that is literally pressing the launch button, watching the game crash before it has even loaded anything and then doing it again etc etc  which means I have tried to launch this game around 60 times (5 mins =300 seconds, 300/5 [time in seconds the game runs for]= 60).I have now contacted Activision over facebook and if they provide assistance I will change this review to a proper one as soon as I can get the game to work....

												I cannot play this game, I'm mostly just writing this to let others know that this is a♥♥♥♥♥♥port. Stay away from this on PC, avoid it like it has the plague. I honestly would love a refund for my money, and time spent trying to fix something that should have already been fixed.Edit: I did get this to start working with my AMD card, there is a wonderful topic in the discussion board that helped, but that still does not change the fact that I would not recommend buying this on a PC, it crashes frequently, and I've had sound cut out on cutscenes at odd times. As for the game itself the story is actually pretty decent, the game is more of the same of prototype so it is fun at times, but the combat feels lacking compared to the first one, this is partially due to having two powers out at once now, and one button is used for either power. Overall I would say it's average for fun, but if you did kind of enjoy the plot of prototype, I did, then this is not a must play immediately but I say an eventually, like you know three years later.

												Don't buy this game. It's just full of bugs. I can't get past one of the first missions, the game crashes during the loading and there is apparently no fix for that specific bug. There are several other glitches that will make your game crash. Ultimately, I think it's kinda rare that someone succeeded in finishing the game. I read everywhere that it's just a very, very bad console port and that there is absolutely no support in case of problems with the game. I regret buying this game.Edit : Bought a new computer with an nvidia graphics card and the game worked lke a charm. However, because of my past experience, I still can't recommend the game. The game is kinda fun but doesn't add anything to the first. In fact, if you played the first and liked it, you don't even need to play prototype 2...it's pretty much the same but less original.

												I missed out on the first prototype, but had this the last time it was on sale with steam.  It played wonderfully on my slightly older pc, nice graphics and i found the storyline to be imersive and fun, if a bit gory, to play.  Mutate yourself into whatever type of hero, or villan, you want to be!What I could not get my head around are the number of glitches in the game, these according to the forums have caused numerous buyers stress, the breaking point came when i reached a point in the game where i could no longer progress in the storyline as a glitch simply stopped the next mission from loading.  I'm about a third of the way into the game, and all i can do now is rampage around the map killing zombies, soldiers, or innocent civilians who get in my way.  I'm completely stuck, and there seems no way around the problem.Uninstalling and reinstalling, wiping the temporary files, wiping all the saves and starting from scratch, nothing works as it seems for me the game is simply broken.Steam should be ashamed to put this back on sale, without first adding a refund button you can use when it simply breaks on you for no apparent reason!

												Definitely not recommended. There is so many reasons why this game isnt recommended. The story is great, the plot is perfect but other things absouteley ruin everything. The game freezes often, stops responding and closes, crashes, the lag is too much aswel, overall the game is REALLY buggy and the developers most likely wont fix it because there is so many bugs. Countless times ive had to restart missions because the game bugs out and i cant play it. Once it didnt even open up its just so buggy. im really dissapointed in the game it had a great plot but ruined by the bugs that are in it. And unless you can put up with your framerate dropping immensely over and over and the screen freezing i dont think you should get this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UnplayableVirtually all of the time that the game has been running has been spent trying to attain a framerate above 10 fps.Shadows don't even render on AMD/ATI cards (the same issue as with the first game and it hasn't even been fixed for that).  On top of that, leaving a loading screen is a grabbag of errors from pitch black skin to invisible character model or just crashing.Using a controller my analog stick input is delayed by up to 2 seconds, the buttons aren't delayed but that doesn't count for anything when I can't see what is happening.I'm a bit heartbroken over this after Saints Row 4 reminded me how much fun it is to charge across a city leaping over buildings and throwing tanks into helicopters, I was really looking forward to playing this.

												$10 game or less only. Never full price. This is a fine $10 game, but that's it. Right off the bat you're faced with nonexistent audio ambiance. I'm trying to tell you that it's completely immersion breaking. The art style is trying to be all ""Sin City"" and it's done horribly. Ready for combat? Unlike the game's predecessor, you no longer start out wrecking havoc with almost all your abilities as a ""taste"" of your power to come. The best gameplay intro in one is completely exchanged for a lame 10 min intro filled with bad acting, bad cutscenes, and horrible tutorial pauses. Then you have the STORY. Now, don't let my PC playtime fool you, I know the story. It's a joke. It's cliche one minute and makes no sense the next. You know how the trailer sets you up? Story goes sideways from what you're expecting within the first five minuets. And not in a good way. This game makes me sad, because I absolutely loved the first game. This one is just bad. The combat was already dated when it was released. In 2017 it's almost unplayable combat. It's so clunky. Do NOT expect Bateman, Shadows of Moreawesome, or Witcher combat. Don't expect assassins creed, hitman, or mass effect style combat. No, let me fully INSULT this game by comparing it to an equally horrible game: FABLEYEAH, this game is about on par with the fable trash bag that was released around the same time. Again. $10 or less for collecting purposes only.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was happy to get this game at first till I started playing it.  First thing I always do before starting a game is go into options.  That section of the game was broken right of the bat. I wanted to select screen resolution and check key bindings.  None of this was possible.  Started the game I quickly found out when it said use left mouse botton only, the right botton worked.  Then when the game said to use right button to siphon life and restore health, no button anyplace on the keyboard or mouse worked. The game was stuck.  I had to alt + delete to quit the game.  Did some google searching and found lots of issues with this game starting with non Nvidia Gfx cards to changeing mouse configurations.  Meeting the system requirements fully, this should not happen.  So I take my thumbs up on this game back and warn others.  This game is  not worth buying.			",44,0,2,7,1,0,0

												The first issue with this game is that I cannot use my mouse because of weird extreme chopiness which is not an isolated issue, meaning it is not uncommon. Fine, whatever. I have to use my xbox 360 pad which is fine I do not mind that at all. But the big issue which is why I've never finished the game is because it is one of the worst console ports I have ever seen in terms of performance. I have a nice rig where on any games that are not poorly optimized or bad ports, I get a smooth 60fps at max settings @ 1920x1080. This game, no. I get 60fps in it yea but also stuttering from bad optimization/coding. It is still playable and enjoyable for sure, just is distracting where almost all of my other games are not because they perform flawlessly.Besides that crap, this is a very entertaining game. You get super powers and using them to fk people up is awesome and never gets old. You can tear people in half and flatten heads and all kinds of cool ways to kill dudes. It's a big improvement over the first game in terms of quality. Better sound, controls, gameplay, etc. Although just like the first game it's a bad console port job. You can send out a pulse and find guys to consume that give you side missions but it seems like they do not become an option until you finish a certain amount of the story.Port job 4/10. Game 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have the feeling I'd like the story better if P1 just straight up didn't exist.The gameplay is fun, and I really do enjoy the leveling system, but after 5 minutes or so of playing, fps goes down to obscene levels. I'm talking 5 fps. My computer can handle most games, but this very particular game, for some reason, ♥♥♥♥s the fps and makes it unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No. Just... No. The combat might be much smoother than the first game, but I just couldn't finish it.[Spoiler alert]It's a BAD THING to turn the awesome main character from the original game into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the sequel and pit you against him. (I'm also looking at you here Bioware... That thing you did in SWTOR..? Not cool).Especially when the ""protagonist"" is a whiny b***h. James Heller was completely unlikable and I found it hard to have any sort of sympathy for him, whitch just made everything worse.

												This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the ""intelligent"" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To people not familiar with Prototype 1, I recommend it, it's a power fantasy and a lot of fun. There are references to the first game but it's not needed to have a fun time. This game is a Power Fantasy and it does that in spades, you feel powerful. Enjoy. My review below is for people who have played and enjoyed the plot and storyline of the original Prototype. To fans of the original Prototype, this game is about the same. It's a big more organized, with a bit more work put into it. But it has the same progression and feels very much like you are just playing the original Prototype with a few extras added in. If you feel a ""Prototype itch"" this may be a decent game to pick up if it was heavily discounted, but I generally do not recommend this game. I do not recommend it because the completion of this game left a bad taste in my mouth. I enjoyed the original Protoype, and loved the story and the plot. But this game throws it all away. Because (Spoilers)  Alex Mercer, the original protagonist, is rewritten as a batshit crazy idiot-ball carrying villian who actively pursues the very thing you fought to stop in the original game. Which, as someone who played the first Prototype who enjoyed and got to understand the complex personality of Alex Mercer, I find to be a complete cop-out, and this just thoroughly destroyed my enjoyment of the Prototype franchise.

												Prototype 2 at first was hard to really give an opinion on. You play as a marine named James Heller who's basic focus is to kill his family's murderer: Alex Mercer. Heller through 3/4's of the game is a cliche 'I'm just the perfect badass' character. And it's very irritating. No, he is not very emotional past flat out angry. While the anger is understandable, it isn't acceptable to me that a character only really acts on one feeling. You will see Heller in other emotions so don't get me wrong, he isn't the same throughout the whole story (thank God). But it's only about 3 times. Other than that, he's a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can't go a minute without swearing. As for gameplay, that's where it took me a while. The combat at first is meteocre since you have no abilities. You just mash one button. Once you get a couple abilities that's when it starts to get fun as you can use two abilities at once rather than having to switch so much in the first title. The side missions are rinsed and repeated, but you become more powerful this way and honestly, it never really gets old being able to sneak in and destroy things by morphing into another human you just ""ate"". They also added a timed side mission where you need to get all the intel canisters before Blackwatch gets their corrupt little hands on them. You only get two mass abilities unfortunately. The first is just the recycled devastator Mercer used. The second I don't want to spoil. I actually like that it takes longer to unlock things in this one. You can't hijack tanks or helicopters nearly as soon as you could in the first, so it makes for more of a challenge. Overall, the gameplay is definitely better than the first, but I do miss the ability to body surf. And I also miss how you dig in and tear up the streets in the first one too. You don't really do that in this one. And if you're curious about the graphics....no they definitely are not better than the first. I run this on maximum settings and it still looks bad compared to the first. But I'm not a person to care as long as the game is solid.As for the story, some say it's deeper than the first. Yeah I can agree with that to a point. The story is very predictable but done decent. Half of the story is told through the important people you steal memories from. I always liked that about Prototype. The end was a cliffhanger and left me wanting more. I hope at some point in the future they decide to make a Prototype 3 to either continue the story or add closure to it. I'd say this game is worth a max of $15 to $20. Better than the first and definitely recommended. But I always feel Prototype could do so much better with the story and immersion. Lets hope they make a Prototype 3 someday and really blow our minds with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Prototype series and having played both of them the second one is definitely the best option on console... ON CONSOLE. Prototype 2 is definitely not worth your money for the PC version, it's a shoddy port that I had problems getting to run (the game has a problem with some HID Hardware meaning that I had to unplug my keyboard in order for the game to run.) and then when it did finally work I was hovering between 30 and 40 FPS and the graphics don't warrant the game dropping below 100 let alone 40 FPS.I can't comment on the port of the original Prototype as I have only played the second one on PC.If you have an Xbox 360 or PS3 I would definitely recommend that you buy it for one of those machines; it provides hours of fun and an unprecedented sense of power. However avoid at all costs if you are planning to buy it on PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's clarify. I WOULD absolutely recommend this game if it was not so definitely broken.No matter if you have a last gen pc with tons of ram (i have 32GB) and a last gen video card (i use AMD wit 2GB). The game lags and crashes every about 10 minutes. It's just a bad porting.Too bad because there are some aspects in which the game really shines. Graphics are very cool, when the frame rate doesn't drop. Controls are improved, and the overall impression, compared to the first episode, is of that a world which is actually alive (also thanks to the motion capture movements and the improved usability).There are also some ponts where, I think, the game is actually worse than the first chapter, like the start of the game (I liked the ""immediately in the game, and the story piece by piece"" of the first episode), which I found quite slow. The second episode has a more RPG-like evolution system than the first chapter, making it duller at some ponts (as someone said, you almost cannot chose at all how to evolve your pg, you have to follow very strict guidelines).But the very bad thing is that you cannot at all play this game. Seriously, it's very cool, but it willl just not run in your pc. Too bad, because it would be a great experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The control is something strange but I could get used to it. The story is good. And I liked the mini challenges. Good things: 	-The story is enough long. 	-Playable challenges. Bad things: 	-The control must get used to it.	-If you not play any of challenges the game become too short. 	-You should set your OS affinity to 1. Because there a several problems with multi core processors. I recommend this game those who like the 'Prototype 1' story and interesting to how about continue the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is awesome. The story, while a cliched ""revenge quest"", is enough to keep you entertained, and the gameplay is downright awesome. Killing enemies is delightfuly gory and vehicle finishers make you feel badass. The whole city is open world, and you can explore all 3 sectors freely.Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut....The game runs horribly on AMD cards. My 6 core 3.5 ghz super machine can't get it to run above 10 frames per second.In most cases it doesn't even run. Sadly, I can't recommend this if you have an AMD card.IF, however, you have an Nvidia card... go ahead! Buy it! It's a great game, just horribly optimized.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I see hunders of people here has like.. 10hours tops on this game, and they don't recommend it because it's♥♥♥♥♥♥with graphics and bugs and ect ect... Get a different graphics card if that is the issue. If you are having lag, try to fix it properly instead of acting like you know everything about a pc/laptop. I am currently running this game on a laptop with a decent graphics card ( 4210M 2.6GHz 3.2 GHz dedicated boost NVIDIA Ge.Force) and i am having no issues whatsoever. I only have like, 1.5 hours on it, but i have played this on console, and i enjoy it alot. I have not encountered any bugs just yet, but if i do, i'll chose to ignore it, or try to fix it. I recommend this game, as it is on sale, and it's a good open world game. If you want to cause mayhem in NY, this is the game for you. Just like The Incredible Hulk.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's much better than Prototype 1 but that's a given for a sequel. The game basically plays like Watchdogs, Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row. The most similar one being Saints Row. The game is basically Prototype 1 with all the same powers and abilities but with a black man called Heller. This game is much weaker relative to stronger AAA titles such as Batman. It feels like they took the standard template in the Unreal 3 engine and chugged out a game as fast as possible (You can see the similarities in Saints Row, Blades of Time, Darksiders and Batman). The map has so many different locations but all they do is make you go between bases e.g. Indian 69.The format is basically the same. Go to Area A, kill everything, Go to Area B kill everything. Go to Area A again, kill everything. The latest Saints Row series can get you everything here. High speed sprinting, air dashing, flying and super powers.I would recommend Batman: Arkham Series as a better alternative, it plays in a similar style and everything is better. PROS1. StorylineI think that's the main draw for me.2. Tank warfareDriving the tank and ripping the turret off. Driving an APC and ripping off the TOW launcher.3. Helicopter WarfareHijacking a helicopter and ripping of their missile launchers.4. ExecutionsAlways interesting to see how it's done.5. PowersThis is probably the coolest you have. However, the powers get pretty mundane after a while.a. Clawb. Bladec. Hammerfistd. Bio-bombe. Pack Leaderf. Devastatorg. TendrilsCONS1. AI is dumbThe same problems are ported over from Prototype 1.a. You can land in disguise from the sky and no one will suspect you of being Heller.b. You can break an alert by turning back into Heller once line of sight is broken, despite being a wanted man. c. You can consume an enemy standing next to another enemy if his outline is white. His friend won't even notice him missing.d. Civilians stop panicking if the alert drops down even if there is carnage all arounde. Too easy to break the Alert. Run behind the wall and press F.f. You can fly in the air and no one cares as long as you're in military uniform.g. If you bio-bomb a unit, you can immediately consume him despite being watched.2. Civilian Collateral DamageAre you trying to save the city or destroy it? You can even consume civilians if you want.3. Targetting systemsIt's horrible. You have to aim at specific target by pressing R. There is no snap to lock on. You can't fix and focus on killing 1 opponent. You can't swtich between targets fast enough.4. Bugsa. Sudden death when the infected pustules expand and you're standing on them in the same space.5. Lousy Attack PatternsIt is very repetitive. Block the attack, spike and stun the opponent, then slash. Do the same thing for all creatures, including bosses. You can basically kill everyone with the style. Granted the combat is semi-punishing if you miss the block.6. Repetitive MissionsEvery mission is the same. a. Ping-hunt target A and consume him.b. Destroy the lair by destroying pustulesc. Go on a run and collect stuff from a downed helicopter7. EnvironmentIt is so boring looking at the same NPCs being generated.a. Same civilliansb. Same army trucksc. Funny locations for bases that have the same design8. ChallengesExtremely dumb. There was one in the stadium where you tried to blow up as many Blackwatch units as possible by landing from the air. The Blackwatch units just stand there doing nothing.SUGGESTIONS1. Improve Your TargetingCode in a snap to enemy.2. Stop Copying other Games, Differentiate Yourself MoreThe format is just too similar. Pinging? All of them have it.3. Upgrade the EnvironmentIt's so bland with no backstory or art. Learn from Batman: Arkham Series.4. Stop the Point A to Point BIt's too similar to GTA's open world format.5. Range Combat How about a bio-cannon coming out of your arm?6. Air CombatI mean fighting in the air, not just hijacking a helicopter.7. Smarter AIRefer to the problems in CONS (1).8. More Mechanized unitsBig mechas, exo-suits that are shielded from an instant consume.9. Living City			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All I know is that on my hd 6970 it wont work.The fact that a game can be relesed in this state is totally unacetable. Low frame rates, constant crashing and even the menus don't work properly.

CAUTION: I've played this game on my PS3 and it had a very fun storyline, so once I saw it at a bargain price during the 2015 Summer Sale I decided to purchase it to relive a very great game. However, I was wrong. I'm running above recommended PC specifications and I'm struggling to get a solid 20FPS on ultra low. After reading through a few other reviews it seems that a lot of other users are experiencing issues as well; namely AMD systems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is alright, but the PC port is the worst thing I've seen in gaming. Pure shame. Better have a controller handy because the mouse will never let you play comfortably. $30 is not worth this, you're better off going to gamestop and buying this game on the xbox for $10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun when it works.  Unfortunately, it needed to be tested against AMD hardware, and wasn't.  Also it has received virtually zero support from the publisher or developers.  It has a known memory leak that causes it to crash after some period of play, issues with resolution, and unpredictable framerates.However, the game itself is pretty cool.  I enjoyed playing it, as much as I was able to.  It's unfortunate that it wasn't handled better.  Maybe someday it'll be patched, but I don't expect it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all let me start off this review by stating the the game shipped broken and was never fixed.  It always had a bad memory leak and certain missions would cause it to crash.  But now since the Omega Drivers release from AMD and the subsequent upgrade to Windows 10 it is time to remove this game from Steam.The game is completely broken.  Under Win 8.1 and the AMD 14.2 drivers you could mostly play until the memory leak ended your fun.  If you decide to run an older OS and even older drivers, you can have fun in the game.  Really it's not a bad game and at times is quite fun!  On a scale of 1 - 100 I would give it a solid 65 with the memory leak lowering the score to 57.Under Windows 10 the game will actually start, but then the memory leak ends the fun after 5 minutes.  Everyone is going to upgrade to Windows 10 for DX12 games.  Thus this game is completely dead.Please Valve remove this game from the Steam Store.  There is no reason to leave abandoned games on your storefront.    I wish Activision had allowed the original development team to patch the game, but alas that's the current state of PC development I suppose.  Release, promote, and run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is sadly a poor PC port and you will likely have to search forumns finding solutions for more than one problem. TotalBuscuits video explains what's wrong with this game better than me but keep in mind if you do buy it you need a controller as there is horrible mouse acceleration which makes the game unplayable especially late game. I got it for £5 in the christmas sale and I do not regret it, I got my monies worth but any more than that and I would say it's probably not worth it and if you are using a mouse and keyboard the games not worth playing even if it's free.

I've heard it may only be a problem for AMD graphics cards, your risk. Luckily i got it 75% off so not a big loss. I don't think it should be on steam given the state it's in.

												This game has so many framerate and processing issues it's difficult to play. Anything that isn't general combat like boss battles or fighting on low energy causes the game to lag or crash. Also it crashes when there is a cut scene or when you are entering an indoor area. The game itself, when not having issues, is relatively fun but the good does not outweigh the bad. Not worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had bought this game, as I enjoyed the original Prototype a lot.Unfortunately the game is nothing like it's older brother. You play as one of the characters you have briefly met in the original Prototype, and apparently after the whole first story, a epidemic found place. Alex Mercer (main character of the original Prototype) the one behind this epidemic, and so the bad guy of Prototype 2.In the original Prototype, the ending showed nothing of Alex turning bad, maybe even the opposite.The game developers turn this new guy into the hero, but you never really feel any form of 'connection' with him. He just seem to be angry and blindly run, and act by rage all the time. I never have a lot with characters that act this way.Aside from that the main story is rather short, and switches from one side, to the other... it almost feels like the developers re-thought the storyline halfway through the process... deciding to change the whole story hafway through.The game never really feels to run truely smooth and the gameplay overal just isn't really working... As a keyboard/mouse player, I sometimes felt like I was making a sailorsknot in my own fingers. You ofcourse can change the buttons & actions linked to them, but it still never really works for me. Therefor I never did many side missions, as the whole buttonpart irritated me quite a bit.The experience might be a lot better with a controller to your PC. It does have a lot of nice, and gory situations, the developers sure have took their time on making things look really disgusting. ;) & Ofcourse the transformations of your character are just like Alex's really nice. The whole sword/arm, and rest of the transformation arsenal are still amazing to use and lovely to see.Overall most of the game just didn't feel right. It had the feel of not being properly finished, and being rushed for the deadline. (Which I am aware of; is now years ago.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid gameplay and decent graphics, even when playing it in 2015.  Got through the story fairly quickly, but that was still I believe around 18 hours in.  Great value for the cost I got it for.  I have an Nvidia card, and it played very well for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mayhem is the name of the game and you have just the tools for the job. You won't get much more than 20 hours out of this - much less if you just aim for completing the main story - but you will get plenty of fun out of it. And its one of the easiest games to get all achievements in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game a while ago when it was on sale and just recently got around to playing it. I know a lot of people are saying they can't play it due to technical issues, but I haven't experienced any issue when playing the game. 3 1/2 years since its release and the grphics are still decent even compared to some of the games released nowadays. The controls are easy and flows very nicely. The gameplay is somewhat easy, nothing can really stop you once you get the hang of the abilities, but the game is very fun. The story is there, but the missions are somewhat repetitive, and the upgrades don't seem very meaningful aside from the evolutions. Game is currently on sale again so now is the time to buy it if you like open world, kill everything games with a bit of stealth. Wouldn't recommend at the original £20 price tag but definitely worth £5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything you would expect from a Prototype sequel in terms of gameplay but the story was horrible. It's kind of like if you threw Sgt. Doakes from Dexter into the exact same plot of Alphas season 2 and set it in the Prototype universe. I more or less cringed through the storyline to get all the powers so I can free-roam like a true badass with the Alex Mercer skin.If you are looking for badass free-roam, pick this up. Otherwise, the story isn't worth it.			",722,102,27,64,33,5,62

												Prototype 2 is one of my favourite open world games of all time, with a bigger focus on combat and better controls than the first game, this PC version both looks and runs better than the original console versions ever did. Stealth is always an option rather than outright charging into combat, and is sometimes necessary on harder difficulties to get out of a mess, but it's clear the focus of the developers was on causing as much chaos with your nigh-invulnerability as possible. The only con is the story and main character somehow manage to be worse than the first game, but that's never been important to either title in the series in the first place.			",199,26,3,23,3,3,9

												The second (and apparently last) entry in the [PROTOTYPE] franchise.New main character, new powers and mechanics and a storyline that takes right after the first chapter's ending.I've played the hell out of this game and unlocked everything at every difficulty, which, by watching the time I've been playing it recorded by Steam, shows one of the main flaws of the game: it's too short.Fortunately enough, the free roaming through the city compensates for the lenght of the storyline and the secondary missions.7/10 - Systematic chaos is a dish best served genetically mutated.

												Well I've played just about 10 minutes of this and looks great and all. Runs smooth for me (50+ FPS) on a GTX 660 2GB Card with 12 GB of ram on a 4 Core AMD. So for that, it's great but my problem is that I'm a PC gamer that enjoys playing with a Mouse and Keyboard and well, this game does not give 2 farts about my mouse or any mouse I use. Mouse simply does not work at all. No detection. So I am left to use a controller which works fine. But it's not really my thing. Will still play the game cause I freakin' paid for it and the story looks good and general gameplay looks fun.TL;DR: Don't buy this if you don't have a controller. Mouse won't work or will be buggy.Will Update when more into the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved prototype 1, Had tons of hours into it on the console. but this... this is garbage. its plot is rushed and the entirety of the game is grocery missions ad nausium. I swear the designer wanted this to be a racing game because 1/3 of the missions are race against time, where you pick up boxes (and they give you a little time boost) meanwhile being shot out of the sky with rockets. For such a bad♥♥♥♥♥I'm not sure why it takes our hero so long to recover.  I tried, I tried so hard to play this game to the end but it was just such trash I just couldn't. I'm somewhat of a completionist so the 20 hours I have into the game are not straight storyline. I doubt this poorly put together plot even has 20 hours if you run it straight. I am just so disappointed at how poorly this followed up such a great game. Not going to say its the worst sequel I've ever played but its definitely up there.  Honestly, Play the first one, its all you need and don't sully the memory with this poor sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(Yes I know about the work around for this issue and I shouldn't have to fix their stupid games to work on a system that is well above system requirements.) Shame on you Activision for not supporting your PC products as well as your console releases. This is the last game from Activision I will ever purchase. So goodbye to Prototype 2 which I never got to know and to the Call of Duty franchise which killed many hours of my time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Getting the picture. Now although I love Prototype 1 with all my heart I must admit, I could hardly manage a measely 10 FPS on the MAIN MENU. I wont even get started with what in-game FPS was like. I'm sure it has something to do with AMD, everyone who says they have FPS issues uses AMD. Also, the Audio was nonexistant with an ocational crackel similar to some Hitman Absolution problems, this also seems to me somewhat common amoungst AMD users.			",115,11,1,15,8,1,13

												Basically the same game: With only a couple more weapons added and a different protagonist who has the exact same powers and skills as the 1st just now with a different skin and voice. Mechanics and missions were not that different. Short campaign, repetitive missions, lackluster character investment, poor port. Essentially this sequel lacked any creativity. They did improve finding collectibles, and they injected some humorous dialogue, but for me it really wasn't enough to elevate this game.You're probably better off getting the 1st Prototype for less you'll get a better story and bosses. It's a fun game if you just want to mindlessly kill and blow up stuff, but then there's prototype 1 for this.			",51,12,1,9,5,0,7

And after some research I found out, that there are many bugs ingame. That's somehow sad because I really like the first game.I don't say that you shouldn't buy this game, but if you want to buy it you should consider doing that in a Steamsale and that there's a good chance that it doesn't work.Edit: Still doesn't work ...

												PROTOTYPE 2 **PC VERSION REVIEW**Never, and I mean never, buy this game for pcTHE PORT IS AWFUL.The movement is awful, theres lag even if you have a decent pc and meet the recommended requirementsmoving the mouse around to look around is laggy. I did not enjoy this experienceMaybe the story is good but from what I have been hearing from the reviews so far, People that have only played prototype 1 will maybe not like this one, especially the steam versionThe actual game itself without its kinks on pc, so maybe on ps3 or something is not.... awful. The combat and running around maybe fun on a console which (hopefully) STAYS ABOVE 30 FPS!The game is pretty fun, but maybe I havent given this a proper chance considering the fact that I have only played it for 90 minutes, maybe the more you play the better it getsOverall with the combat story and the quite pretty graphics, (on PC that is, PC MASTER RACE! :D) It can actually be pretty fun based on the reviews if you actually put some time into it, which i really didn'tOverall, 3/5, I would reccomend getting this on the PlayStation 3 Rather than the PC Version, you will have a much better timeMaybe the port isnt bad and will work fine on your pc, but on mine, not even slightly			",88,9,2,5,8,0,2

												The visual engines of both Prototype games behave in a strange manner:1. They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)Both engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.I've tried every ""fix"" I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.So I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.As such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.

												Overall 6/10Gamers know whether a game has good replay value within the first 10 minutes of playing, by that time if the mechanics of a game don't capture your imagination, you can forget replay value. I'm a very positive person and I'd like to start by saying that if there ever was a Prototype 3, I would play it and give the series another chance to redeem itself, so dear develompent team working on Prototype 3 and development team who produced Prototype 2; please review some notes below in regards to why Prototype 2 sucked, and what was good about it.-The reason Prototype 2 sucked: The mechanics and controls were nowhere near as fluid as the first installment of the game(starting out), nor did they emulate the controls of the first game very well. The game does not feel as 'quick paced' as the first. What I mean by this is that even turning around is too slow, running up buildings I feel like some fat guy with a corn cob shoved up his butt, trying to race to the nearest toilet, casually. Gamers need that 'parkour' feel that the first game had without the fat guy running to the toilet feel the second game has. Your gamers want to feel like ninjas, Super Hero Ninja Samurai Monks(title in development) running through the city, thumping into people and body checking them just to see them slowly stand up and act like nothing happened.  The camera controls felt a little laggy for default, and sometimes did't work at all when trying to get an outward view while running up a building, it was very frustrating trying to fight the first 'Pink Hulk guy'when you changed the dodging mechanics that the first game had. I mean, are you guys even gamers? You do realize that you DON'T need to change essential game functions like that to create a great sequel? Anyway, besides the controls there were several other problems with the game that was basically annoying to sit through and act like I care: The story was way too linear, and the intro/tutorial was too long, and should have had an obvious 'skip' option for the experienced Prototype One players, and if there was an option to skip the nearly hour to two hour long intro tutorial garbage, I couldn't find it. Thats one thing top gaming companies have a problem with, turning videogames into an interactive movie that you have to sit through, thats one thing that destroyed my joy for the Assasins Creed titles. I'm sorry I'm the type of gamer that needs to hear my objectives and story while I move around and goof off, its more emmersive (its one gameplay feature that Doom 3 and half-life did very well, and I am hoping to play the latest iteration of these games also.) Character didn't feel as powerful when landing, climbing and picking up objects. There were much bigger and more pronounced textures and effects in the first Prototype when landing and running up buildings(the cracks on the walls and holes in the ground left from contact with his powerful limbs.) This was a particularly satisfying touch to the first game, makes you feel like you can break through anything(without leaving the destruction around for too long.) The way levelling your character worked: I prefer the Evolution Points method, seeing that you have hundreds of thousands of 'something' on the HUD when your playing as a super hero, and then spending it all, has its appeal. It has a certain appeal in a lot of games actually, makes you feel more accomplished.Did I mention that the intro tutorial was TOO long, limited, and drawn out??What Prototype 2 did right: Explosions worked pretty well, but thats one feature that is easy to make look good. The boost wave effect when you hold down the run button was a nice touch, but somehow wasn't the right kind of emphasis on his actual speed in the intro.The overall textural appearance of the wolverine ability was much nicer and cleaner, and the fighting style for that super power wasn't bad either.The new enemy types were a great and welcome addition, namely birds and other land creatures. Its nice when game sequals give you a fresh variety of enemy types to combat.I liked the effect of the hunting ability, the radar sense was pretty cool, but I think it would have been better if the minimap was involved in the hunting ability, then you wouldn't have to be required to get to a really high building just to seek out targets. Gamers like the freedom of choosing how they execute a search, as long as the enemy/target general location is easily determined.Like I said, I really hope for a Prototype 3, And don't give me this 'theres too many super hero games out there' crap, the super hero genre is alive and you have a whole class of gamers waiting to play the newest original title. By original I mean, NOT a Disney/Marvel mashup,but a game like Prototype with its unique querks and storyline.			",193,7,0,22,6,0,13

I loved the first one so I was excited to play the sequel but terribly disappointed to find out that it's completely unplayable with my AMD Radeon 6950 and there is absolutely no sign of support from the publisher so this will likely never be fixed. Granted this GPU is old now, it still runs most games maxed out or nearly maxed out with no problems. The fact that I can't run this game even with all graphics settings turned way down and resolution reduced makes no sense to me. Maybe if I had an Nvidia GPU it would work but I don't feel like buying a new $300 video card for a single game when every other game out there works fine. Unacceptable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can't recommend this, unfortunately. After installing, I first had to spend about 1,5 hours trying to get the game to run beyond the intro (which was, admittedly, awesome). I finally managed to solve the problem with help from others in the forums and eagerly sat down to play.I uninstalled the game after 45 minutes of play time. I loved the original Prototype because of the way that its story was told and because the factions involved (Blackwatch specifically) were interesting. Not dog-kickingly evil, but clearly not nice, either - just trying to prevent the spread. The gameplay was lots of fun too, but that wasn't what led me to get Prototype 2. If you are all about the gameplay, this review might not apply to you.In the short span of time I played, I was dismayed to find that the interesting-seeming protagonist was, in fact, a violent and stupid thug with no redeeming qualities, easily led and manipulated. The game's villain was apparent right from the start and was all but moustache-twirlingly evil. Blackwatch appears to have become an organization of deathly stupid dog-kicking nazis who (minor spoiler) release infected into ""test areas"" apparently just for the fun of it. The open-world gameplay didn't work for me either; I found the city area cluttered and overly full. The new look works and it makes sense to have people sleeping rough etc., but I missed the clear lines of the first game. The control change for gliding and airdash REALLY annoyed me as well, especially as I had replayed the entire first game and scored platinum on all movement events for the fun of it just before starting the second. I loved the way movement flowed in the first game and it just seemed completely unnecessary to change it in the second. Some of the mechanics seemed promising (consuming specific evolved to gain certain powers, etc.), but all in all, the cartoonish ""villains"" and idiot unsympathetic protagonist killed this game for me very quickly. What a shame.			",53,21,0,16,3,0,14

												++powerful characterbloody killsmooth movementenjoyed fightingvary zombies types and enemies--everything look light weightno car driver as the firt game beforemouse issues -.- very annoyedYou have to remove USB devices before you launch the game and put it back after game starts (cause of badly port from console)simple A.I.Heller's activities is common for people -.-?? For example, falling from the sky!!Prototype 2 is already dead game, No team's support and No patches. This game can be better but it's look like the expansion of the first game, Prototype. It's not worth for full prize. If you want to get experience from Prototype and you've never play this franchise before, I recommend PROTOTYPE 1. But if you've ever play prototype 1 and enjoyed it, PROTOTYPE 2 may be your answer.			",127,21,0,10,21,2,46

												This is not a review so much as a warning, i was compleatly unable to play the game as mouse inputs left click, right click or movement where all broken and there is no support for the game so there not likely to ever be fixed.I looked for a manual fix for my problem but all i found where more people with the same error that no one seamed to resolve as well as a tone of other bugs. If any person who buys a game has to look for a FIX for it before they can play something is seriouslly wrong and while people are haveing no problems 10$ on sale is still a gamble for something that might not work ",82,15,1,7,12,0,2

												I wouldn't recommend buying this game, unless it's on a 75% reduction in price. The issues with this game are unreal: lag is bad, it's poorly optimised, and the bugs in this game are so awful! The game has recently started crashing on loadup, not a CTD, it freezes on  the title screen before I can even press a key/button now.However, the game is beautiful, the storyline is brillaint and James Heller is a badass with a somehwat dark sense of humour that has had me giggling to myself every now and then. The gameplay is smooth, and the powers and abilities you gain grow and evolve in order to make you nearly invincible, and this limitless power is what makes this game, and its predeccesor have so much fun. I would definitely recomend getting this game though, if it were on sale and/or have a console, and if you played Prototype 1, then I would say buying this is definitely worth it.8.5/10 for non-PC --> great graphics and immersive gameplay and storyline3/10 for PC --> poorly optimised PC port			",16,2,0,3,1,0,0

												While a good game in and of itself, there are simply too many bugs preventing its playability.There are two memory leak issues with the game, neither of which are fixable without an update by Activision (not happening).There are also graphical issues with AMD cards, where the shadows do not render properly. That's not getting fixed either.There are also apparently a plethora of other issues related to mouse/keyboard compatibility and random crashes.All in all, I'm honestly quite amazed that Activision released this product on Steam without any follow-up patches to fix the issues it was suffering from.Overall, do NOT buy this game if you dislike unstable games that do not have a solution. By far, this is worse than Cities XL's degrading performance issue that was never successfully patched.I pity those who were suckered into buying this game at 75% off. Myself included. :|			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I did not enjoy this experienceMaybe the story is good but from what I have been hearing from the reviews so far, People that have only played prototype 1 will maybe not like this one, especially the steam versionThe actual game itself without its kinks on pc, so maybe on ps3 or something is not.... awful. The combat and running around maybe fun on a console which (hopefully) STAYS ABOVE 30 FPS!The game is pretty fun, but maybe I havent given this a proper chance considering the fact that I have only played it for 90 minutes, maybe the more you play the better it getsOverall with the combat story and the quite pretty graphics, (on PC that is, PC MASTER RACE! :D) It can actually be pretty fun based on the reviews if you actually put some time into it, which i really didn'tOverall, 3/5, I would reccomend getting this on the PlayStation 3 Rather than the PC Version, you will have a much better timeMaybe the port isnt bad and will work fine on your pc, but on mine, not even slightly			",88,9,2,5,8,0,2

												The visual engines of both Prototype games behave in a strange manner:1. They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)Both engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.I've tried every ""fix"" I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.So I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.As such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.

												While a good game in and of itself, there are simply too many bugs preventing its playability.There are two memory leak issues with the game, neither of which are fixable without an update by Activision (not happening).There are also graphical issues with AMD cards, where the shadows do not render properly. That's not getting fixed either.There are also apparently a plethora of other issues related to mouse/keyboard compatibility and random crashes.All in all, I'm honestly quite amazed that Activision released this product on Steam without any follow-up patches to fix the issues it was suffering from.Overall, do NOT buy this game if you dislike unstable games that do not have a solution. By far, this is worse than Cities XL's degrading performance issue that was never successfully patched.I pity those who were suckered into buying this game at 75% off. Myself included. :|			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've found fixes for it, but they're temporary relief and shouldn't be needed. Don't get this game on steam.

												I can get almost around the first corner in the game following dude and it crashes. When I verify the install it says something's missing? NICE! Reinstalled it, same thing. I only paid 12.74 for prototype, prototype 2 and the radpack so I didn't REALLY get burned. Would have been nice if it would have worked. I see a LOT of people with this problem. I bought it before I knew this, I should have checked it out better. My son says it worked with his amd 6990 and the older 12.9 catalyst but I'm not going to reinstall the old catalyst, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. So I would stay away from this game. Prototype runs fine so I guess I got my moneys worth. I'm still pretty P.O. about it though.			",144,19,1,11,19,1,5

												If you played the first Prototype and liked the story, Prototype 2 will be a letdown. The story has all the major underlying plotlines - which were left hanging in the last game - are all but completelly ignored, in favor of some easier to understand ""angry soldier kills tough guy"". The final battle with Mercer feels too cheap and easy even in the higher difficulty settings, and the ending itself is one big meh. Prototype 2 also simplifies the power and upgrading system, the new one feeling so much shallower than the original; we also see that many of the interesting powers from the first game didn't make a return on this one. If you need a game in which you slice people up at will, go ahead and buy this; if you expected a true sequel and an ending to the many cliffhangers of the original Prototype, well, you'll be left hanging.Edit: I see a lot of people complaining about the port, which was, in my experience, one of the greatest parts of this game, with the controls being extremelly fluid, no noticeable lag or technical problems (running on a GTX960 at max settings).

I'm sure it has something to do with AMD, everyone who says they have FPS issues uses AMD. Also, the Audio was nonexistant with an ocational crackel similar to some Hitman Absolution problems, this also seems to me somewhat common amoungst AMD users.			",115,11,1,15,8,1,13

Posted: May 11, 2014
												Well, first things first.  I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, just another gamer.  I played the original Prototype all the way through, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  While it started out easy, it got harder and harder the more time I put into it.  By the end of the game the strike teams could harass me repeatedly, and without careful positioning, they could lower my health to dangerous levels or even kill me.  Groups of Hunters were almost as difficult in the end of the game as they were in the beginning.   I particularly enjoyed the story of the first Prototype.  Alex Mercer's character fascinated me from the moment I learned what he truly became after the outbreak at Penn Station.  You're probably wondering why I'm talking about the first game in a review for the second.  It's to provide contrast.After I finished Prototype, I moved on to Prototype 2, as I had bought them together.  I was mildly irritated by a few of the default controls, like how the toggle Disguise button is now F, which was the stealth consume menu/military disguise power menu, and how the new targeting button was the old power wheel selection.  I was able to remap the keys to be more similar to the older Prototype's controls, which made the game much easier to get used to.  Prototype 2 takes advantage of its open world much more than the original did, with collectibles (black boxes) and little mini-missions (field ops and infection lairs) that reward you for their completion with perks, like making him repel all bullets, take reduced damage, increase the range of his melee attacks, and power up charge attacks for each of his virus powers.  While these are very enjoyable, they lower the overall game difficulty immensely.  The disguise/stealth system has been overhauled, with the suspicion meter actually moving up based on your actions in front of the military.  It's also much easier to evade strike teams; when you break their line of sight, toggling your disguise makes them stop and look for you, instead of pursuing you to the ends of the earth even if they can't see you, like they did in the original Prototype.  The whole game world also looks more vibrant, with some areas actually looking like a city people live in, complete with angry protestors and anti-military and anti-Blacklight posters and graffiti, while other areas look like the devastated hellholes they're supposed to be, crawling with infected mutants and screaming civilians desperately trying to escape the clutches of bloodthrirsty monsters.  While most of the animations are the same as the ones from the first Prototype, they still look smooth and believable, and still make you feel that the main character is superhuman.  I also enjoyed the new Hunt system (viral sonar), which makes finding targets satisfying and interactive.Now for the things I didn't like.  I absolutely HATED the new main character, James Heller.  The beginning of the game makes you think that he's a family man gone mad with grief and rage after the avoidable deaths of his wife and daughter at the hands of the second outbreak of the Mercer virus, but after the first few minutes, it's incredibly clear that that assumption is false.  He's more like a walking stereotype, the ""Angry Black Man"" stereotype to be specific.  He's incredibly foul-mouthed, with each few minutes of the game laced with profanity that sounds like it was written by a middle-schooler.  He lacks the amoral qualities of Alex Mercer, even though he's doing the same terrorist-like activities; most of the time he thinks he's doing things to help people, when really he's doing more harm than good.  It's doesn't seem to be intended, as a quirk of his personality, only lazy writing and bad character personality design.  He feels two-dimensional, like a caricature.  His sole motivations throughout the entire game seem to be rage and anger, nothing more.  He's mentioned his family all of 4-5 times during the entire time I've played the game, and seems to care more about killing random people for random things than actually getting revenge for his family's deaths.  I also immensely disliked the changes they made to the throwing and targeting systems.  It's far harder to lock on to specific enemies than it needs to be; they have to be right in front of you to be able to easily lock onto them, and anything else requires careful positioning and small movements to target anything that's farther away.  Linked with that, the hitboxes of rooftops are larger than they appear, which makes it very hard to throw objects from rooftops unless you have a decently upgraded jump, or the target is positioned in such a way that it's easy to lock on to and nothing is in the way.  Also, so far in the game, the only thing I've learned from the story is that Blackwatch is a horrible organization.  That's about it.  There is no more character development for Heller, just him learning about some atrocity that Blackwatch soldiers have comitted.  The final thing I dislike about it is the overall dumbing down of  the combat system in the game.  I know it's getting more and more common for games these days, but it's just pathetic at times.  In the first Prototype, to dodge you had to hold Shift while pressing a movement key, and during the roll you were susceptible to damage and relied on positioning to be able to set up attacks once the roll was complete.  Now, in Prototype 2, all you have to do to dodge is press Space, and you somersault over them and have a clear opening to their undefended backs.  It takes no skill beyond pressing a button at the right time, and it even tells you when you need to press it.  Hunters used to be dangerous, even after you could grapple them, as long as they were in packs, but now they're barely threatening at all, and even the super-soldiers that Blackwatch sends after you are now only a minor annoyance.  They're supposed to have been designed specifically to kill you, yet after a few damage and defense mutations, they can barely scratch you, and can easily be killed, even when they're backed up by helicopters and tanks and other super-soldiers.  Oh, they also radically change Alex Mercer's personality, which was one of the things I disliked most about Prototype 2.  He becomes incredibly hypocritical and an all-around scumbag instead of an amoral self-serving mutant.  He was hard to like in the first game, but at least he was semi-relatable.  Now he's just as two-demensional as Heller, only serving the role of antagonist with a subpar explanation as to why.  There is little to no explanation as to what caused his rapid and extreme personality shift.  I haven't fully completed the game, but looked up the full plot, since his character was bugging me, and I was about 99.9999% sure of what was going to happen in the end less than halfway through the game.I know I listed more negative things than positive, but I don't really dislike Prototype 2.  It's just that it feels like it was made by a seperate group of people than the first game.  If you're looking for a game similar to the first, I'd recommend trying the inFAMOUS series for the Playstation 3 and 4 before you try Prototype 2.  It's not a bad game, but it's different enough from the first game to make it less fun to play.  It would almost be better to play Prototype 2 only, or at least first, and just watch a recap of the first game's plot in the menu to understand the events in the current game.  It would probably lessen your disappointment.  Overall, I think Prototype 2 puts in some good changes to the series, but at the cost of overall game difficulty, bad plot and characters, and questionable tweaks to the existing game system.  I think, objectively, it deserves a 6.5 at the lowest, and a 7.5 at the highest.  If you enjoyed the first game, you'll probably like Prototype 2, but you'll have to overlook its obvious flaws in order to do so.			",141,37,1,23,10,2,18

And not just a couple here and there, you'll get a couple frames every 5 seconds. This doesn't stop the action, so you'll die while a lone soldier fires at you.I wouldn't recommend the PC port. Pick up a copy for a console if you have one.			",200,39,3,23,26,4,18

												Ehh... look, it's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. But it's not particularly good either. The bad guys are absolute caricatures, the combat is rather similar to the first one, and honestly it doesn't -look- that great. Certainly not like a game that came out within the past year.Also the indoor combat magically turns your keyboard and mouse into a Dvorak keyboard and a ham sandwich, respectively. They become that useless. Indoor combat consists of attacking where you think something should be maybe but you don't know because your camera has fallen in love with the wall and it'll be a cold day in hell before it turns away from that beauty to look at whatever stupid crap you want to look at.

												The game worked perfectly for me, not sure why other people can't run it.The game was a good and fun experience. Not as much of a thrill as that first time you learned each power in Prototype1, but it has its moments.Using stealth to avoid unnecessary combat was always my favorite option, but when I had to fight, I would always call in my Brawlers. Some might consider having five large allies as a mechanic that ruins the game experience, but you can always choose to go at it solo if you prefer.There were a few things I did not like in this game, but they were tollerable:Defensive misionsPowerless Blackwatch missionsTimed ""collect the cargo"" missionThere is always an easy way to win a fight and a hard way. The game lets you pick which one you want to try most of the time because it is an open world.The game encourages you to do side missions and level up because you become more badass and powerful with each upgrade. With the right upgrades, the game can become more and more fun.Glad I bought this game, I will revisit it some day when I want to run through both the games and relive everything again.

(unplug keyboard, disable devices)No I do not have a crap PC, but I had more fun playing this on X360 than I have at all on PC.			",402,63,24,28,27,7,44

												After checking several reviews and PCGamingWiki like I do everytime I buy a game, All I heard about this was how it's pretty ""meh"". A terrible port. The usual, like always I never take their advice and just decide amongst myself. ""Maybe it'll be fine and work for me"" The keyword being ""maybe"". So the games go on sale and I figure, it's only £4 right? Not that much. Well it doesn't work, during the tutorial mission It crashes every single time, no warning either. I've tried about 10/20 fixes and nothing changes. All I wanted was to play Badasstype 2 but nope. Can't have that. I just wish I didn't waste that £4 I could have bought myself a bombay badboy potnoodle, Rustlers burger and a Dr Pepper, watched Archer on Netflix and jacked myself off to sleep. Waste of money I paid £4 just so I could say ""I have Prototype 2"", O'rlly? How is it? ""Dunno, doesn't bloody work"".			",208,40,6,54,14,1,27

												I highly suggest to buy this game if you can handle some memory leak lag in-game, even if you have a strongest PC in the world you'll get A MASSIVELY LAGGING ISSUES in about 20-30minute playing it. This is not lying : I actually bought Prototype 2 last year (and it's a pirated version and CHEAPER) but there was no lagging issues seriously.Prototype 1 is actually quite more fun when in the free roam BUT Prototype 2 has the funnest, funnier(actually Prototype 1 seems doesn't have alot of sense of humour), actions on the Main Missions and Side Missions.Apart from that, Prototype 2 has alot of different features than Prototype 1. But, if you haven't play Prototype 1 yet and play Prototype 2 instantly, you have no problem (and you suck for not playing the first). The parkours are okay in Prototype 2 but this new ""chasing the  Evolved]  system"" are quite hard and sucked just because of it's parkours.Finally, you can't have fun in the free roam eg. you can't find any  Orion 1/ Super Soldiers  in the free roam, you can't find  Thermobaric vehicle , you can't fight/find  Evolved  to fight againts the millitary. You can only find them in the Main Mission and the Side Mission. Prototype 1 has everything you want to fight/use/enjoy what they have eg. (Weapons, vehicles, infected) except for the Hunter Leader and Super Mutant Hunter something. I actually still enjoying playing this game because of graphics.  ",55,0,1,2,5,0,7

												I did not even get this game to start without some community-forum hacks. But even with these hacks the game keeps crashing from time to time again. I got ~1,5 hours of playing now and meanwhile the game crashed to desktop 5 times. The auto-save seems to happen completely random so that you have to repeat quests you already did from time to time again and again. Further more I got a really strong computer (according to the game was released in 2012) but the game keeps running on low frames with ""micro fps lags"" which makes the game feeling MASSIVELY unfluid.I am really really really disappointed of this Game for I liked Prototype 1 very much...

												It is quite impressive how Radical managed to brake nearly everything that worked just fine in their first [prototype]. Let's start with the main character: Heller is just dumb brute and no amount of his dead loved ones makes him relatable. Mercer's quest for identity was nothig astonishing, but at least his lines were never this cringeworthy. And in no way he deserved to be made into this horrible kind of villain. Movement and fighting mechanics? Never truly shined the way they were intended to thanks to the broken lock on system. Movesets of each weapon are lacking variety and being able to use two at a time doesn't just scratch that itch. And most of the pleasant little details and moves were added only to RADNET edition. The story? Goes all over the place and gets nowhere without a sequel to deliver any catharsis whatsoever. Verdict? Play the first one and hope for a reboot. We need a decent [prototype] game on the market and we don't have one yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely abysmal port. Windowed mode (or a borderless fullscreen script) is needed to have anywhere near fluid mouse movement and smooth gameplay. Other than that, the game is...decent. It's nowhere near as good as the first game, though. The story makes no sense, the main character is completely unlikable and as illogical and stereotypical as it gets, and the gameplay is just not as good.The support for this game was literally abandoned before the game was even released, so that's saying something.Get the first game instead, it's a lot more fun.

												The game ran horribly even before I got out of the start menu. Once I got into the game, I was smothered under an overlong cutscene that I couldn't even watch, because the lag was worse than trying to play League of Legends on a ten year-old laptop.Full disclosure: I am using a laptop, rather than a thousand dollar gaming pc. That being said, Prototype 2 isn't a new game by any stretch and isn't old enough to require special equipment to run. Also, my laptop has no trouble running games like Far Cry 3 and Saints Row IV, so the only conclusion I can come to is that the game is just poorly optimised.I also read somewhere in the comments that it won't run on Windows 10, but I made it past the point where the commenter said the game crashed on them. I thought I was in the clear and could adjust the quality if I needed to.On that note, when I finally managed to get into the menu after slamming the escape button and m key and any other button I thought might bring up the menu perhaps two thousand times each, I found myself looking for a thesarus, because the wording on the settings for this game are so technical, you'd have to study at MIT for four years to know what slider did what.To top it all off, when I set all of the ambiguous settings to low, and hit, ""apply,"" the game crashed and I had to manually shut my computer down to turn the game off.If you have the fix for this sort of thing and you want to try your hand at getting it to behave for two minutes, then I can say that the brief glimpses of game that I saw through the horrible lag and buffering were very pretty. I can't be bothered to even look for a fix to this mess, however, because I'm afraid my computer might spontaneously liquify if I ever install it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Few games are as i see it, but a 3 year old game? no and no,,shame on you.!Pick it up on a sale, unless you reheeally want to play it now. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game ran horribly even before I got out of the start menu. Once I got into the game, I was smothered under an overlong cutscene that I couldn't even watch, because the lag was worse than trying to play League of Legends on a ten year-old laptop.Full disclosure: I am using a laptop, rather than a thousand dollar gaming pc. That being said, Prototype 2 isn't a new game by any stretch and isn't old enough to require special equipment to run. Also, my laptop has no trouble running games like Far Cry 3 and Saints Row IV, so the only conclusion I can come to is that the game is just poorly optimised.I also read somewhere in the comments that it won't run on Windows 10, but I made it past the point where the commenter said the game crashed on them. I thought I was in the clear and could adjust the quality if I needed to.On that note, when I finally managed to get into the menu after slamming the escape button and m key and any other button I thought might bring up the menu perhaps two thousand times each, I found myself looking for a thesarus, because the wording on the settings for this game are so technical, you'd have to study at MIT for four years to know what slider did what.To top it all off, when I set all of the ambiguous settings to low, and hit, ""apply,"" the game crashed and I had to manually shut my computer down to turn the game off.If you have the fix for this sort of thing and you want to try your hand at getting it to behave for two minutes, then I can say that the brief glimpses of game that I saw through the horrible lag and buffering were very pretty. I can't be bothered to even look for a fix to this mess, however, because I'm afraid my computer might spontaneously liquify if I ever install it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												so this takes place a few years after prototype 1, alex mercer has went insane cause he tripped to much LSD in the last one, you play as a miltary dude called ""James Heller"" who is infected by mercer, thats all i really know cause i got a 100% save xD the side stuffs cool, like infected hives, blacknet challenges and stuff, and there is infected targets through the free roam who you can kill to get upgrades for stuff like helicopters to your own weapons and abiltys, it is indeed a step up from prototype 1 and side challeges still remains, something brought over from the first, what pisses me off is that they took most the powers from the first away and stripped it from 11 to 5, but the armor is in the skins that they added, you can even be alex mercer provided you have all the Radnet♥♥♥♥♥♥done, the skins have normal heller, a zombie heller, test heller, Infintry Heller (before mercer infects you), Armored Heller (If he had mercers armor ability), Armored Mercer (Looks changed from the original), and the normal variant himeself, also a zombie merceranyway this is most likely my most longest review ever..and some some pros/consPROS | Graphics, gameplay, altered New York from Prototype 1, Tendrills, Skins/Outfits ALEX MERCERCONS | Lack of powers cmon, 5 powers Prototype 1 had about 11. >:/ got this for the summer sale as a gift and i wont regret it :Dalso you can mod it by going to your prototype directory changing the exe fle to prototype2original.exe, put texmod in then call that prototype2.exe after this change the engine file to prototype2originalengine.dll			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So I guess that means it won't work even if you run it in compatibility mode. And yes I tried all the other ""fixes"" like unplugging all USB stuff and all that. Doesn't work. It used to. That's how I've got three hours on it. But now it just doesn't work and I can't get a refund...			",138,32,1,17,4,0,2

												Let me tell you why I started hating this game. You see, instead going fair, the game changes your ♥♥♥♥ing controls during boss battles, you randomly fall through the floor, and some boss battles have non avoidable attacks right after the cutscene, just removing your health for no real reason. Oh, and did I tell you that you can fall through the floor? You can also change gravity and fall upwards, which is kind of entertaining. Or fall through the wall. There are many bugs in the game, and as such, it's not playable. Enemies instantly regenerate all their health by being stuck in an animation. Another fun fact - some of your attacks won't work on bosses. I'm fine with that, but if only the OP attacks work, then the boss battle turn into wathing the same animation forty times, due to the fight difficulty being the incredibly long health bar of your enemies.The good parts:+ The game runs smoothly.+ Free roaming is great.+ Carnage is fun in the beggining.+ When the game is not completely broken it's really fun...The bad parts:- ...but it is broken all the time.- Some of your attacks are completely worthless and some are incredibly OP.- Bosses use unavoidablr attacks to make your life miserable.- The plot is so stupid, I honestly prefer to watch Batman & Robin to it.- The main character is the biggest idiot in the gaming universe.- The plot twists that aren't even changing anything, while being obvious.- The mentality of most characters points to mental retardation.- Soundtrack is irremarkable, just generic action game music.- After some time, everything becomes annoying to the limit, expecially the collectables you need to upgrade.- Listening to the same lines over and over and over and over...

So it happens, that I have to play the same situations again and again until the game ""allows me to go further"".This is simply unacceptable. If I knew about it, I wouldn't even take the game as a gift.Unfortunately I paid for the Game.Is there anybody out there to take the responsibility and make sure that people who pay are able to play?Why do I not expect that this will change?

												HORRIBLE PORT!This game is just unplayable. I cannot even start the game and I have done everything I can, including updating the 'driver's which is a typical/copy-paste response for any technical team. I have the system able to run GTA V, come on! When I verify the game cache it always says that there is just one file that isn't right and it never downloads it no matter if I restart steam fully or restart my computer.Some say it is the graphics card and now I am beginning to think it is that... AMD has a LOT of problems running it, and funnily enough I have a AMD graphics card. AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series.Perhaps you may get it to work by disabling many things on your computer or buy a new graphics card, but if one person has to go through all that trouble just to start it, the game has some serious issues and possibly more in store. The developers don't even care to fix this problem as it has been a problem for some time now as I realized. I am not even sure why Steam is even selling this at all because it's a complete failure as a port to PC.Don't think the developers care as long as they get the $$$Thank god for refund options or my friend would be screwed gifting me this. Otherwise, I suggest getting the console version and play it on there instead and maybe then you might have some fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was not ported well over from the consoles to the PC, and it really shows when you play it. The game itself is immence fun, focusing on openworld exploration and combat, with the main character having crazy genetic based powers. The game itself is all about speed and manuverabilityl, which makes the fact that you can not keep a consistent framerate in this game at all. This makes the game literrally unplayable when too many things are happening on screen. Prototype 2 is never gonna get fixed in any official capacity, and there is no consistent way to make the game run at a decent framerate. This means that for all intents an purposes it is fundamentaly broken and should not be played by anyone who values a smooth experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I havent left many reviews for games, but gotta say this game (pc wise) is broken. Extremely fun open world, skill upgrading game, but with some massive bugs. The first major problem i encountered was in one of the early story missions where you get your claw mutation and you were required to do a claw pounce. Every time I did a successful claw pounce the game wouldn't recognize it. I was stuck at that part for the longest time untill i searched online for a solution. After i managed to fix that, my game crashed around every 20 minutes without fail. That was never fixed. Maybe they released some bug fixes? I dont know, but if not be careful.

When I got it I was very dissappointed. The port is just terrible stutter when moving camera with mouse and you have to mess around with it for a while to let the game run its self at 60 fps. and if you have an amd card it will not even run the game.

												Really an Unplayable Game.Stuffed full of Bugs and they didn't bring any fixes. Can't even Play it just for one mission. Everytime I tried to Play it hang itself. One way the game Freeze and Load, and Load, and Load... or it Freeze the other way that the Player ist Stand still without can do anything. I also tried to Fix the Problems by myself like some one Said with change the Video resolution and much more, but nothing will help. That is such a Shame for the Game Devloper, also because the first Prototype make so much fun, that many people buy the Second one just to get such bugged Crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really good even though it is really redundant and long. I really enjoyed playing this game threw the story the only thing i found frustrating was the hunt feature easy to get lost if you dont know how to use the radar also theirs no multiplayer component so you cant play co op with friends or compete against them if there was mutliplayer it would be alot better and it needed more variety also if they reduce the price to like 16$ i would definately buy it if i didnt have it. They could have done alot more with the game to make it have a higher score and make it more of a thrill for players the first 10 mins are the most epic part of the game after that it gets really tideous and boring.

												Story is good, combat gameplay is excellent, and the pacing is fine. The only real problem lies within the fact that this is a console port. Nvidia graphics cards have less trouble running the game, but most other cards like ATI have framerate drops to the single digits at random times, regardless of the quality of your other hardware.One more thing: RAM. Prototype 2 easily eats 3-4GB of RAM constantly. Do not buy unless you have 8GB or more. Occasionally, the game will hog all the RAM and CPU resources and freeze everything, including the task manager. The only known solution is to enter the task manager right after launching the game, and under Processes, Set Affinity to CPU 0 only. Even with this, the game can still become unplayable.tl;dr - Good game, poorly optimized port.			",125,25,0,17,15,0,8

												COMPLETED 100%Prototype 2 quite feels like a dumbed down version of Prototype 1 and is impeded by a lack of challenge in both enemies and gameplay structure. The story is pretty straightforward in this sequel and really nothing to be excited about.As advertised, you play as Venom... I mean Heller this time. A former marine who gets powers from the MC of the first game, Mercer. Eventually they both clash when Heller realizes who the real bad guy is. And that's pretty much how the game boils down to. Missions have taken a step backwards as disguising plays a more important role and you'll find yourself infiltrating enemy bases far more often. It could have been a good thing, if not for the fact that the devs doesnt seem to put much effort into this. The stealth aspect in this game is honestly, laughable. Marred by incredibly dumb AI that's beyond ridiculous. Soldiers see you flying in the air? Jump 100 feet in the air and drop right down? Nope, nothing out of the ordinary. See the infamous James Heller walking right in front of their face? Nope, they just see you as a regular civilian. But do something as small as jump over a table or hop over a comrade? Everyone suddenly goes into red alert. You don't even to silently consume people if you don't want to. Just grab the guy, consume him, jump over a fence, transform, jump back into the base 10 seconds later and everyone acts like nothing happened at all!The world of P2 is fairly large but is now divided into three separate areas: Red, Yellow, and Green Zone. Each having a different nature and scale of infestation, thus providing for some fresh scenes for free roaming. On the other hand there's only 3 kinds of interiors you'll ever enter in the entire game, and that's military bases, labs and infested lairs. Most of which are just copy+paste in appearance. Missions are where the game tends to get slightly repetitive, particularly in side missions. Find this, kill that, find that, destroy this. There's not much variety in what you do apart from causing destruction and mayhem everywhere you go. That's where the action comes in; it's still fun slicing up enemies and covering the streets in blood and gore. But it's too simple, because the game is that easy. Even worse, you have significantly less attack moves and powers to use, as compared to what the first game offered, which is another disappointment.Prototype 2 suffers terribly from many shortcomings but is still the same old enjoyable fun you can get for an open world title. Sadly not much of an improvement from the first game, if not, at all.PROS:- The Red Zone is pretty awesome in scale and magnitude- Venom/Carnage simulator- Blood. So much blood and gore. And explosions. Lovely.CONS:- A few power moves stripped down or removed from the first game- The same old Manhatten open world is nothing new- Sh*t AI stealth mechanics; escaping from an alarm or strike team is like a walk in the park- Too easy to beat- Game is very badly optimized for AMD cards, including forced enabled mouse acceleration in the game which can only be disabled through INI modifying			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A port so bad that it got ""Mixed"" reviews from AMD users alone.If you have an Nvidia card and don't mind memory leaks, plenty of crashes, and a bug that can't be fixed without temporarily disabling all but one core of your processor, go right on ahead.  Behind the awful port is a decent game.If you have an ATi/AMD card, avoid this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port like the plague.  Even if it ran well (it doesn't), it has no shadows whatsoever and again, it runs like crap even on the menus.  Under no circumstance should an R9 280 be brought to its knees at 4 FPS and 70ms frametimes on a three year old game, much less a main menu.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												I usually do not write a bad review if I cannot play the game (afterall the game could be really good), however because many people had the same problems:I tried for hours to actually start the game, but it always stopped working. And when I finally managed that, it keeps hanging or crashing after a few minutes in game.There are many suggestions to solve these problem, however none of them seem to work. I didn't try to download the unofficial (uncut) patch, because a) I had to download them from not trustworthy sites and b) that is what I use steam for.So if you try your luck, make sure you do not try for to long so you can refund it if necessary.

												I have never written a review for any game ever before, no matter how good or bad it was... but this one, this one just takes the cake.It's currently the worst game you could possibly buy on steam. Worse than Bad Rats. Worse than Day One: Garrys Incident.Worse than WarZ, DayZ or any other Pre-Alpha game that just wants your money and doesn't give a f*ck after that.Why you may ask? My reasoning is simple: Yes the titles mentioned before are an abomination to gamekind and a prime example of lazy developers who won't (or aren't capable of) producing something that manages to even come close to being worthy of what you pay for BUT AT LEAST you are able to start these games up and play them.Not so for Prototype 2, no. Your experience with it will be 5 mins of cutscenes and walking around at ~12 FPS (game hanging/freezing from time to time) before it ultimately crashes.No patch provided by the developers, no fix, no tweaking anything, nothing. I've done literally everything to try and make this junk heap playable, searched on steam forums and google but to no success.Imagine a casual gamer buying this pile of sh*t expecting a fun weekend experience. You might aswell bend over and ask Radical Entertainment to use a lot of lube.Did anyone playtest this crap before releasing it? I wouldn't be surprised if the time spent on making the PC-Port for this game was about as long as my playtime on it.F*ck Prototype 2. F*ck Radical Entertainment and everything they stand for.F*ck Activision. F*ck lazy Developers not giving a f*ck about gamers only wanting their money. Bunch of f*cking sellout pr*cks.Don't make the same mistake that I did by buying this game. Instead use the 30€/40$ to buy a bunch of giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥, package them and mail them straight to 369 Terminal Ave, Vancouver, BC V6A 4C4, Canada so that the people who made this game at least have the proper means to go f*ck themselves.

												Prototype 2 is an especially good action game where you play the role of sergeant Heller with lethal surpernatural shape-shifting abilities given by Alex Mercer. During the game Heller wants her daughter back and to stop Balckwatch and Mercer from destroying New York. Missions are excellent and contain a lot of fight against Mercer's creatures and Blackwatch elite troopers. You can consume almost everybody to gain health and to obtin memories that help you to understand better the story. In the city you can find collectibles to be found and liars to be cleared for mutators as a reward. Mutators give you superpowers and you can earn XP points by completing missions. As you level up you can open and obtain upgrades that make Heller more deadlier and give you advantage during the gameplay. The game ends with an epic fight against your creator, Alex Mercer. Prototype 2 has the ""Radnet Access"" pack dlc that gives you 5 unique abilities and 50+ challenges to complete. 8/10			",244,15,3,28,3,1,6

												Problems I have with this game:So far, I've managed to play more than one and a half hours of this game, and not been able to get past the first mission (aka. the tutorial). During every cutscene, the game somehow seems to enter a state where it has to recalculate the entire environment or something. Actually, I don't even care WHAT it does during that time, because after every cutscene, I can bet my♥♥♥♥♥that I'll be stuck in an infinite loadingscreen, introducing me to another round of ""start the game from square one"".How to avoid this problem: so far, this problem never occured if I actually skipped a cutscene - but let's be honest here: I'm trying to get into the story of this game, and there is NO way I'm doing that without cutscenes.How to solve the problem when stuck in the screen: Just close the damn game. Just for fun, I've even left the game in a loading screen for a while today, just to see how long it takes to finish up loading. After one hour, I closed the game, because I realized that♥♥♥♥♥♥would not be progressing.I do not dislike the game itself, the concept seem fairly decent to me (so far). The problem I do have, is that the game is unplayable for me, which is (obviously) a huge let down - especially since I'm a huge fan of the first part of this series.			",47,3,0,9,3,0,8

												1) Essential purchase2) Recommended purchase3) Recommended purchase during a sale4) Not recommended unless heavily discounted5) Not even recommended for Steam game collectorsGreat sequel... meh portPROTOTYPE 2 is the sequel to 2009's open world action-adventure video game [PROTOTYPE], it pretty much keeps what made it's original game great, the over-the-top action, gore and combat. It's what really makes PROTOTYPE 2 a successful sequel and an overall superb game. Though it also has (just like [PROTOTYPE]) a really mediocre story, it's not exactly memorable, with the main character being forgettable alongside every other character excluding Alex Mercer, who was already slightly memorable from the original game.Now to expand on the story it's pretty much you start off as James Heller, a soldier who comes across Alex Mercer and tries to kill him, he doesn't succeed and gets infected by Mercer and hence the story of PROTOTYPE 2 begins from there really. And really after that point the story is forgettable, I care for none of the characters, sure the way the cinematics are made to look is nice but that doesn't I will be intrigued by what's going on in the cutscene, because it's just not entertaining to learn about. Now saying that I myself found the ending to be actually ok, it doesn't really elaborate on the after events, but the boss battle is really good at the end, even if it does seems to be the same as the others except with more health...And that leads me to the gameplay of this game.... my ♥♥♥♥ing god the gameplay is superb, this game alongside it's predecessor has superb gameplay, it's ♥♥♥♥ing great, just going around killing everyone with abilities you gain throughout the game, causing chaos towards the city of New York is just so satisfying. The fluidity of what you are doing is there, it's just so fun, you can go around in the Green and Yellow zones completely destroying bases full of Blackwatch soldiers or go into the Red zone fighting against all kinds of monsters created from ""Blacklight virus"". It's just so fun just going around destroying everything, and I could honestly say that it is as fun to do as in Just Cause 2 and 3, which PROTOTYPE has in some ways a similarity to.The graphics are ok, it's not brilliant but looks very much like a game from 2012, if you want a game which is graphically pleasing this isn't really anything special which is sadly to be expected as the engine was more so a improvement of the original [PROTOTYPE] engine for the gore and chaos instead of the graphics.The controls in this game are something to debate on, it's not bad but it's far from perfect, the controls are correct and it's all what it should be for a typical game on PC, but it feels at times that the mouse sensitivity is broke and that there is a mouse accerelation in the game that you can't turn off, it doesn't feel right and can get really annoying, but if you have a controller it won't be an issue as it seems to be extremely well there.... and that's a problem, because it also shows how this game was really not focused to be on PC, for christ sake the PC port took 2 extra months to release and just like everyone else is saying, it's a bad port, my PC build is a GTX 980, i7-4790k, 16GB DDR3 RAM, Windows 10, and I have seen on High settings an average of about 60-80FPS, sure it's not bad but this is a game from 2012, and worse of all if you have an AMD GPU/CPU you may not even be able to get the game running at all, and heck I consider myself lucky as Windows 10 users with NVidia GPU's have reported the same issue. And if you think this will be solved, well it won't as the developers pretty much shut down before the game was even released on PC! And it's a shame because if these issues were to be resolved then this game would be a solid buy.TL;DR+ Superb gameplay.+ A slight variety of areas for open world.+ Combat~ The graphics are only ok~ Mediocre Story~ Mouse Acceleration?- The PC Port is terribleOverall the PC port is a 6.5/10			",612,124,20,70,49,12,63

												A port so bad that it got ""Mixed"" reviews from AMD users alone.If you have an Nvidia card and don't mind memory leaks, plenty of crashes, and a bug that can't be fixed without temporarily disabling all but one core of your processor, go right on ahead.  Behind the awful port is a decent game.If you have an ATi/AMD card, avoid this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port like the plague.  Even if it ran well (it doesn't), it has no shadows whatsoever and again, it runs like crap even on the menus.  Under no circumstance should an R9 280 be brought to its knees at 4 FPS and 70ms frametimes on a three year old game, much less a main menu.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												For true PROTOTYPE-Fans (Like me) is it a MUST to buy it.But to be honest: I'm dissapointed. IT'S A REALY BAD PC CONVERT and I say: ""BUY IT FOR THE CONSOLE.""For the PC, its pretty bad. Alot of bugs are in like some sound bugs or animationfailures BUT THE MOST WORSE: The start-load crash. I mean I had to pull out my mouse and my keyboard to start that game! Isn't that abit stupid?In that game you have mostly to kill only, theres no like ""Now you have to safe that one"" or ""entertain that child by killing a clown"" (lol).The story is cool :3As I said, you should buy it only if you're a TRUE PROTOTYPE FAN.Else, don't touch it. It cost to much for 49,99€ (don't know now price in dollar)Else, buy it from an another site if you want that game still.			",302,70,6,34,19,2,20

												I loved Prototype 2 and completed it, even though I struggled to play through the first game.The graphics are decent, the controls are great (with a pad) and I didn't get any technical issues, however the forums are full of people with stuttering caused by memory leaks.I played on SLI 670's with an i5 2500k and had no issues.The combat here is fantastic, brutal and gory.  The addition of vehicle takedowns makes you feel like a complete badass, and the new ability to turn people into infested grenades is brilliant.Would recommend to anyone with the caveat that you might have some technical issues.

												[IF YOU HAVE AMD VID CARD RUN.. DO NOT BUY]This isn't a bad game over all. I wish that the main goal wasn't to kill my old character. I would of much rather played him that Heller. My main problem with this game is that it will not work with AMD Radion R9 290 at all. No work arounds, nothing just can't play it. It will alsp prove to be a complete pain to use with any AMD if you are lucky enough to get a work around at all. I feel that they shouldn't even sell this game for PC until they fix this problem, but its been years with no fix so I doubt they plan to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My thoughts on the game having finished itI cannot even begin to describe how dissapointed i am in this game, and I say that with great sadness. I have only just finished it so I wish to put my thoughts out there while they are fresh.if you were looking forward to an interesting improved version over the origional Prototype you will be serverly dissapointed. if you want to have some more fun in the Prototype universe, go play the origional again and save yourself the pain.Credit where credit is due, Prototype 2 DOES look good, I will give it that. But thats about the ONLY thing it does better then the origional. It just feels as though the developers kinda.. well... dumbed it down for example the progression system in the origional was that you would earn EP (Evolutionary Points) through the main story and through doing side missions and then you could freely choose how you would evolve your character with a few story limitations (which made sence) and could unlock new abilities and combo moves.In Prototype 2 however the EP that you earn are directly channeled into a liniear level up bar where once it is filled simply gives you a level up point that you can choose to place in either:HealthRegenMovementMassFinishersand Disguise (which in almost completly pointless I might add)Once the point has been placed it simply gives you a straight up boost to the thing that you choose.... and thats it....how boring. Now before people go off at me YES you can do side missions to aquire ""mutations"" (selectable passives) but again that is quite boring and not worth going after as the game can quite easily be completed without aquireing more then a single passive...Another problem is that many of the enemies you will encounter are just re-skins. There are some new enemies but most if not all will instantly be recognisable which is a shame.most of these things I could deal with but what really put the nail in the coffin for me was *not really a spoiler*The final boss fight, Obviously you fight the protagonist from the first game (Alex Mercer) and I have to say it was one of the worst if not THE worst boss fight I've ever had to force my way through, because I refused to give up on the game after making it so far, but my GOD it was terrible.I like many of you I'm sure remember building up Alex to be the ultimate badass killing machine. Yet once you reach him, to destroy your maker.... it's just pathedic. The fight is a spam fest of dodging and back stabbing with scripted movements, camera angles and area restricting nonsence.First off. The spam. my GOD the spam. Yourself and Alex literally jump around each other constantly because many of Alexes attacks are unblockable and auto hit unless you are spamming the hell out of dodge. Then once you land behind him you back stab him a few times, then rinse and repeat.The camera angles kind of lead into the area restriction problem. you confront alex on top of a building and after having the whole game free roam, you are now restricted to this one roof top for the duration of this fight and in doing so the camera has to use funky angles just to try and keep up with all the stuff flying around the screen causing many, MANY problems and it is just stupid. Yes the origional did the same with its boss fight but at least it had a semi decent reason of being on an aircraft carrier and at the very LEAST that boss had minimal scripting and the fight was still ""free roam""In all honesty it would have been better if they had just made Alex like the (minor spoiler) Evolved where they fought you around the city in free roam. It would have made the fight so much better.All in all I am dissapointed which makes me very depressed as I absolutly loved the first game and played the hell out of it, this sequal.... just makes me sad.If you are new to this universe go buy the origional and have a blast. If you are a fan like me? then just avoid this and go have fun with the origional again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first, this game looked to be a slightly upgrading version of the first Prototype: similar powers, better upgrade system, same silly story, slightly better gameplay.  Then out of left field comes the crippling framerate issues.  Apparently if you have an AMD graphics card, this game's framerate turns into a Powerpoint presentation as soon as one of the following things happens:1) It rains. (This happens fairly frequently.)2) A helicopter shows up. (Ditto.)3) The game just wants to ♥♥♥♥ with you. (I SENSE A PATTERN HERE.)Keep in mind that this is with the graphics set to the lowest possible settings.  Even then the framerate issues persisted, and I eventually just gave up.  I've jumped through MANY hoops to play good games (I spent nearly 2 days getting both Fallout 3 and Myst to work on my PC) but this game appears to run like♥♥♥♥♥♥for no reason whatsoever - I've tried multiple fixes on the internet but nothing has worked.I paid 15 dollars for this and regret it, because I didn't even get to play the whole damn game.  A huge disappointment considering that I enjoyed the previous game in the franchise.			",254,48,5,41,9,1,39

												Oh boy! I just picked this up on the Summer Sale for £5 and even though I had heard all the complaints I figured ""what the hell"" ...... Anyway, I wish I had saved my money! I have a monster rig and it runs terrible!......Fraps said I was getting 60 - 90 fps but it doesnt FEEL like that.....at 90 fps it actually feels like 25!! its not smooth at all! I tried turning all the settings down but no change!Also I attempted to use mouse and keyboard as I prefer it, but was forced to switch to controller as it just doesnt work right with mouse! The lesson learned here is, it doesnt matter how cheap this game is on sale, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!			",128,13,12,6,6,0,15

												The game itself isn't too bad, but the technical issues and lazy developers make it a chore to enjoy. This is the bottom of the barrel console port that went horridly wrong. I had to jump through hoops just to get the game to run at 30fps. If you're up to running fixes to get a game working, you'll probably have a good time, but I can't recommend it as-is.

												The game is more like a alternate verison of Prototype 1. They improved some gameplay aspects to give more usability, but the story didn't draw me in at all, mainly do to a crap main character and turning Alex into a maniac without explaining why. Heller was crude, abrasive, and had a rather dull oneliner for every situation. Using the zombie skin that turned most of his dialogue into hisses and growls made the game significantly better (and not just for the absurdity value).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After every cutscene the game stops and i have to kill its process. I already did some research but it is not possible to fix this.

												So basically to sum everything up: I LOVED the first game and I gave the second one a try a long time ago. I tried to run it on my old PC and managed to get like 15 minutes into the game and after that there was no fix for the constant crash. So after purchasing a brand new PC last year I though i might give it another shot. More than 20 different fixes tried in various combinations and it's a mess.I can't play further than the first 2 minutes of the prologue. And it doesn't even save a single time, so I had to start over and over again. And now I am at the same Point i was the last time i tried to make it work. SCREW IT!!!I spent the last 11 hrs trying everything to make this game playable. A refund is not possible. It wasn't after I purchased it and it is not now. Steam is unfortunately supporting developers who sell broken code for a ton of money to naive customers just because they want more of your money.I like steam but WTF? This can't be real. Why is this game even still up on the market? It violates everything I know and yet steam has the only marketplace on this planet where broken stuff is being sold as brand new without refunds possible!And to the develpers (or rather Activision, since they propably put development on rest): Shame on you! This is something a company of your size shouldn't be doing! Grow a pair and put someone back on the job to fix the issues! But i know you won't since it still pays you off without needing to make it work properly!			",68,5,2,6,7,0,1

												Ok This is my final revew For Prototype 2 final version. Iv gatherd Info on lore and gameplay from all three avialable sorces Gameplay youtube Videos And The Actual Videos intervews found in Radnet DLC.  Let me start this of with This games Lore is♥♥♥♥♥♥but when all is said and done storyline done all DLC done. Its a Great RP Becose no trace of mercer or anything off the story Is Visable to anyone who dose not know it happend.My take Alex Mercer is 2diffrent people Alex Mercer the first is an intirely diffrent person than the second Why first in the lore of prototype if u go to wiki Alex saves the infected city yes But in gameplay he did cuzz he couldent let all those inasent people die as he states in a mission or cutscene he contenuasly expresses his concern for civilions threwout the story. With subtitels on its far easyer to understand. and all the other sorces depict him as a Killer well u know i think that one might actualy be Parah (2nd Mercer). Greens Son. acording to lore Parah is alot like mercer just he was a natruly bred Prototype he was born that way. this Mercer has diffreint style and power than the first. Maybe Parah Confronted Mercer and killed him it stated Parah was the only one who could stop him maybee parah Mimiced mercer and Mercer is still out there somwhere. but this is not the mercer u play as in prototype one. Now this game U kill Alex or as i call him Parah i say this for many reasions one he has diffrent powers than Alaxander J Mercer. they look identacle but some of his abilitys are missing. Witch intern give heller the uperhand. if heller faught the origanl Alex Mercer with his curint build Alex would mame heller. Game play is Open world city is devided into 3zones Red Yellow and green Also unlike Prototype there are Random Transformations of civilions into walkers this only happens in they yellow zone as the Red zone is a war zone and they most of the time die by walkers. Green Zone is the all clear dayly life zone. U gain XP Find colectibles and get perks with Radnet DLC pack u can play as Mercer to  some extent. Obviasly Hellers powers remain. This Game is not as fast pasted and chalangeing as Prototype but its a fun RPG and Mame kill slaughter when ur mad for whatever reasion After u beat the game 100% these are its only 2 uses. Well with radnet u could compeet with firends who have the game and ranet too. See who can spill the most gallions of blood i curintly  have aroun 1,130,138 gallions spilled.  oh and its a great game for going basurk with when ur♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Sence heller is nothing but♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off rageing maniak atleast mercer had perpus. Every one of hellers coments i Rage Rage Rage theres no charicter.			",62,5,0,18,5,0,12

												Very good gameplay and idea. It controls and looks well and overall is an amazing game. But in my opinion the story line isn't the best. I'm not saying the story is (on its own) bad, but I'm saying that it doesn't really work with the 1st game's story all that well. However if it was a standalone game and they just explained Mercer more, then it would be fine.  And it also seemed closer to gta or any other game like that rather than prototype in my opinion (gameplay wise). This kind of ruined it for my due to me getting so into the story of the 1st game. This makes my opinion mixed. If your looking for a good game to play and don't really care about the story working as a continuation or even as a sequel to the 1st game's I highly recommend this game. But if you want a great story instead this may not be the best. Although  while I cannont 100% confirm this (due to me having no trouble with keybindings or fps) most people say that there are alot of problems with the key bindings and fps.			",45,4,0,2,12,1,2

												Prototype 2 is the sequel to the one of the most enjoyable games in ages. What's unfortunate is the fact that, due to many crashing issues and other horrendous bugs, Prototype 2 was the nail in the coffin.The story doesn't mesh as well or is an entire retconning of the first, but it's still fun if you can get around the random crashing.Snag it if you have the patience.

												Everything is great until you come to the running side missions, as a common type of mini game, you have to run to collect packages, with each package collected extending ur time. While these seems normal, theexact amount of time you have and amount of time you get for collecting each package is just enough to get you to the end. Which means, if you acidenly go the wrong way, don't bother trying to fix your directon, just restart, since like I said before you have ""just about enough"" time. While this may seems like a minor annoyance, it seems the game devs loved to include this as a side mission, so I have to keep on doing these mission in order to gain perks. I think of them as hard as nails platform level, since if you make one mistake, it doesnt make sense to continue, you may as well just restart. Other than this, the game is epic, just fix this probelm game devs, and ill gladly give this game a thumbs up. (Also, dealing with rockets while trying to climb a building is impossible, if you try to block the missles, you fall, if you get hit, you fall, if u try to avoid them, you can't, leading to an almost impossible game of luck, not skill).Oh and also, can you disable the automatic manuver that happens if heller runs off the edge of a building (he throws himself off sideways). If you hit space 1 milisecond too late, he does this, and I have no clue what this manuver is useful for, when i go off a building, I either want to glide, or fall straight down. This stupid animation, stops heller from gliding for 2 seconds, by which time, you have lost a considerable amount of height, or you have hit the ground. In the side missions when you have to run from package to package, this single animation has made me have to restart a single running mission more than 50 times (it got to the point I started counted my restarts). There is not use for this animation, and all it does it makes a normal challenge into a touch as nails platformer like challenge, which if I wanted that, I would have turned the game onto hard, but im just playing on normal, so can enjoy the game and the story. This animation is almost like Heller deciding to take control rather than the player controlling him and unless it is a cutscene, I should be the one controlling heller.)

												I originally played this on a console and thought it was reasonably good, so when it popped up in the steam sale for next to nothing, nostalgia took over and i bought it. However, I wish i hadn't now.While the game is a ok'ish game, the performance issues make it unplayable and I had to uninstall. I have a good workstation PC with an i7, SSD, 32gb of ram etc... and even on all the lowest settings this games frame rate drops to unplayable levels. All the other 100+ games I have on steam don't have this issue on medium or high settings, so it must either be that the game is buggy or it's not liking a particular piece of hardware or software i have. Either way, I can't recommend in it's current state and like a few other games, I wish i could get a refund, but i know that will probably never happen on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game itself is a decent sequel to a game built around a decent idea, however...the PC port is awful. You have screen tearing, memory leaks, random crashes every half hour, Any action, such as pressing a button too many times or taking a screenshot can send you crashing. Then you have to start over the mission you were on. Frustrating crap like this makes you hate the whole console driven market,The thing I hate about this ""game"" the most is that you spend 20 minutes on a mission, get to the final part of it - the video flashback .. and it crashes, so you have to start all over. It's a justice that this dev studio got disbanded.			",67,4,5,5,0,0,4

												Having already played Prototype, mixed feelings. Upgrade system is improved, but starting out with so many powers as opposed to gaining them organically makes being a superhero less special. Too easy to run/fly away from alerts. Conversely, couldn't finish the game because of a mandatory stealth mission. Didn't want to continue after losing to a giant tentacle or something which I could have killed if I wasn't responsible for babysitting the military while restricted to using guns that took several attempts to pick up and fire in the right direction. Only fun if you're content to ignore the story, screw around and throw civilians and military personnel across buildings, and you have Garry's Mod for that. Not enough bang for twice as much buck.

												You should have played Prototype 1 first to understand most of the story.The game is good, NY is big and buildings good detailed. You can drive with tanks and fly with helicopters but not with normal cars = bad :( .You can use all weapons from soldiers and you can grab weapons from helis and more but your best weapon is you and the virus in you.Game has many side missions and bonus events, i guess cause of a bit too short story. The final fight was good but nothing special, end sequence also bit too short. All in one its a cool game cause of your cool arms and the great city which is fully open.Sometimes i had some mysterious game crash without any known reason. or it starts to lag a bit and then crash but it was not that much for getting angry. :)7/10			",1213,488,72,153,192,15,219

												I would have given it a VERY weak ""yes"" for a recommendation. Then I finished the game. The final boss fight is the typical ""let's take the game mechanics we've developed so far and throw them out the window"". They disabled most of the useful moves, and turned the final battle into a 1 on 1 street fighter knock-off. Without the good moves or combos. Disappointed. A few years ago I'd have been angry, but these days a company screwing up the ending is kind of expected, unfortunately. Apart from that, the story is weak, although there's a couple of good turnabouts. The gameplay is somewhat repetitive as is the case in most ""grind em till you got 'em"" games that use side-quests to get gear and level up. The game mechanics and moving around is somewhat fun though, so there's that. Controls are definitely better than the original Prototype. Game was solid - only one crash, no idea what happened. So it goes from a weak ""yes"" to a weak ""no"" for recommendation. If there was a ""meh"" category I'd probably pick that, except for the ending.			",119,13,0,29,5,0,6

												The worst story I've seen in a game... Ever... The gameplay is fun and enjoyable, I think everyone loves to run around butchering people and consuming them but when it comes to the story is when the game falls short. The story feels some what forced. Within the first 10 mins of playing the main protagonist joins Alex mercer who he originally believed to be the bad guy and fights against who he originally believed to be the good guys. There are plenty of plot holes as well, E.G. The priest you meet at the start of the game, who the hell is he? all we are told is that he knows things... HE IS A PRIEST!Anyway, te story is too forced, jumping from one scene to the next not really knowing whats happening. It's kind've like the beginning of Farcry 4.			",122,31,0,17,16,1,11

												Okay, so this is a bit of a difficult one...The first Prototype game really captured my interest, but the city felt too small, restricted and indestructible.Thankfully in this game that is less of an issue, but i couldnt help feel that a great deal of the animations, and models were just recycled from the first game, with slightly changed textures. The enviroment was still invulnerable, even when blowing up something huge, and player impact on the city was minimal as the ""city control"" mechanic had been removed.That said the game did improve with more powers, More challenging creatures, and a (if slightly overused story line) good story. In P2 you get to control a pack of infected which is awesome, by the way.However even after consuming mercer you still dont get access to your own small personal horde, something players loved the idea of. Overall i don't actually reccomend this game, as it has done a ""call of duty"" Level offense. It's copied its old content and tried to sell it as new content.Heartbreaking.			",74,4,0,5,10,0,18

												Only buy this game if it is on sale for $5 or less and you have an Nvidia graphics card. If you look at the steam forums many people with AMD cards can't even start this game.I was able to run this game on max settings, getting consistent 55-63 fps, only had a few drops below 50 but never below 40. Good - Fun action (sometimes ruined by the camera and controls)- Fun goreBad- Storyline, very predictable (2/3 through the story i had to start skipping the cut scenes due to the stupidity of all characters)- MC is very 1 dimensional, and can't jump, run, or do anything besides walking at normal (human) pace while on a cell phone -_-Horrible- Camera, I died many many times due to the camera focusing on a wall instead of infected I was fighting. The camera is so bad it actually ruined the last half of the game as I realized it was my main enemy.- Controls, in part due to the worthless camera and part trying to sneak up on a enemy who happened to be next to something you could pick up, you have a %50 chance to grab the enemy or grab the object breaking your sneak and alerting everyone.

												game was a complete let down compared to the first. All they did was create a small map, place a handful of missions & say done. That's all, no explanation what so ever about why Alex Mercer changed, or why he wants who he does at the end other then 'resilient blood' nothing else. To even further degrade the game I found they removed most the powers that helped you survive the first & only added a few new ones that are more to finish a mission then actually be useful. Even worse was the new guy you play as, he pretty much gets handed all his abilities in minutes, while you actually spent most the first game evolving to survive & gain the advantage other enemies, which actually helped extend the game and make it more enjoyable for players. Not to mention how he sounds overly dramatic at times as if he's actually good and not just a pitiful attempt at the dev's to recreate the first ones success. Overall this game is a complete waste of money & should of simply been made into an expansion for the first game than a separate one.			",8,3,0,20,5,0,9

												I'd love to give it a positive review, but unfortunately it's stuck in one of the first missions with an objective that simply won't let me complete it. After a relatively quick google search, I found multiple forums on the issue - and yet, 5 years on, it STILL hasn't been resolved.			",220,42,2,28,21,0,1

												It'll try to keep my review short this time.Combat i fun and seems varied but gets repetetive and unchallenging later on.The world is smaller and less interesting than previously.The rpg aspect is limited at best, and annoyingly it's impossible to fully develop your chracter in one playthrough.The main chracter is a huge♥♥♥♥♥amp;hole. Really, really a hatefull jerk. The daughter and family parts don't match the character you play and seem like they were added last minute to make him more likable, they do not. Seeing that that didn't work the makers of the game apparently decided to make Heller seem less like a collossall deuche, by making all enemies into even bigger♥♥♥♥♥holes. This i consider a cheap move which ruins any story. This is best shown in Mercer, who is out of nowhere a psychopath. I was most angered by that, as i liked him in P1. So yeah good going, P2 story team.All in all, Prototype is a good for a bit of combat, but not much else. I don't recommend it. Even if it is on sale, there are better games for you to play.

												it freezes on loading unless you skip the many cutscenes. This allone makes it almost unplayable especially with checkpoints way to far of, so that you have to play some levels 3 or more times just to see every cutscene. Also the tutorial treats you like an Idiot, the game is badly converted. And it has quite a few bugs that can occur some are gamebreaking (like events that make your charakter freeze up, but than nothing happens). The story looks quiete unoriginal and boring and the new protagonist just seems to be a more boring mercer. Old game mechanics are recycled but overall the charakter feels just less fun to play around with.To be fair i haven't played it that much and there is some kind of progression system in place, so that could change during the game.Also so many cutscenes that i wonder if they rather had made a movie than a game.

												In all honesty if you've already bought and beaten the original i wouldn't say this is worth the asking price. It  still feels like what should be DLC to the original rather than dedicating an entire game to it. Stuff like the idle animations on menus seem like they're copy/pasted from the original title. If this wasn't purchased in the summer sale i'd feel rather ripped off			",142,13,3,11,14,0,4

												Welcome To New York, NY. A city yet again ravaged by a Bio-Nightmare created by the insidious Lab Corp known as GENTEK. In this Melee Survival Horror you are the protagonist James Heller. Heller who lost everyone that he loved thanks to then terrorist MERCER and the Blacklight Virus incident. Heller suffered a murderous breakdown for a long time but then was reactivated in the Marines & sets out to Destroy MERCER. MERCER infects HELLER and turns him to his side where HELLER quickly learns of a plot behind the 2nd Bio-Outbreak. Heller finds and takes advice from a Priest he knew from back in the day. During his journey he starts putting the puzzle pieces together to find those responsible and stop them. In the city he’ll travel thru “Zones” and tackles different missions to save people and absorb/consume Bio-Mass Monsters. He’ll level along the way and gain some new & somewhat similar but revamped Powers. With these new abilities will Heller be able to stop the Bio-Outbreak and save the city, or will he find himself a Patsy used for the next level of experiments.  Morph up, Strap down & get ready to find out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok so I got this during the Activision sale 2014 for $10. The only reason I got this was because it said ""shapeshifting"" and I love those sort of power related games. Like Saints Row IV, which I strongly suggest as well. Now I went in hearing the IGN review which gave me low expectations. But OMG this game is great! And it has open world which in my mind is always great. It doesn't have a huge variation in what you actually do... But it's so much fun just running through the missions blowing sh#$% up. And to be quite honest the story isn't half bad (surprisingly). Now the powers are cool but it doesn't take a lot of skill to play. But I have spent quite a while running around putting bio-bombs in people! :) One of my few problems with the game is obtaining new powers takes forever! But past that game mechanics are great!!! Now on the technical side it doesn't take much to run the game which is good. And I actually haven't found too many glitches. +Lots Of Powers+Open World+Can Get Really OP+Just Plain Fun-Repetitive-Takes A While To Get Powers (can be overlooked)All in all 10/10			",404,84,9,46,42,7,45

												I give this game an 8.5/10. As someone who isn't a big fan of open world games like this, I can't stop playing it. The world is massive, I haven't come across a single terrible mission, there's constant opportunity to improve your character and unlock new abilities. Not to mention just traversing the city is fun on its own (running up the side of buildings, hijacking vehicles, gliding from rooftop to rooftop). This game improves upon the first in every way. If you're looking for an amazingly fun open-world game that makes you feel like a total mutant bad♥♥♥♥♥ look no further. This is the game for you.			",163,7,2,20,3,1,4

												Prototype 1 was pretty ""difficult"". You had to remember a awefull lot of combinations for the attack moves. Like in old fighting games like Mortal Combat and co.The gameplay is heavily simplified. THAT is not a bad thing. Really. The story is ""O.K"". Some improvements here and there. Some little things went worse. The ""Parque-Movement"" is now lame. The first game was a little smoother in the movementabilitys. However it was fun and is a great addition to the first game it think.If you liked the first part, you wont regret this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The storyline is good, the new changes in the game play are even better and the enhanced graphics are somehow really fitting to make you get that feeling of climbing real wall of a building. I finished the storyline twice and collected all the steam achievements in about a week, just because it was so much of fun.			",34,2,0,6,2,0,3

												It was certainly worth the 13$ I paid for it, but the game does drone on a bit and the ending is just lacking. The game basically tells you approximately where each collectible item is, so you don't have to search the net or spend forever hunting them. The combat is simple and enjoyable. The story is boring and the dialogue is awful. I didn't bother trying the game with Keyboard & Mouse, I just figured it'd be best with a controller... as these sorts of games tend to be.

												This is a very entertaining game in how you can interact with the open world environment however the sandbox nature of it gets redundant after a while.  I felt like I kept doing the same exact things over and over with the only changes being as you evolve more powers.  The boss fights aren't even remotely challenging and so it's a run around the world and smash whatever you want type of game.  Fun for a few hours and I might come back to it if I get bored, but it really lacks depth.			",286,44,5,39,19,0,29

												Plot is a mediocre retcon of the first, though the writing for the characters is good and manages to be entertaining. Gameplay is too easy, but the game gives you a ton of abilities to experiment with so it never manages to get boring during the 20 hours it takes to get 100%. Graphics and city design are better and more detailed than the first, though the city is now 3 zones separated by loading screens rather than being one large area.One of the better sandbox games this generation despite its flaws since it actually feels like a sandbox rather than an interactive movie where you do nothing but drive from point A to point B as is the case with most titles in the genre.

												Prototype 2 is a game that I want to love, but I can't,  A d yet for all it's shortcoming, I can't bring myself to delete from my gaming memory (or even say outright it sucks).  Prototype 2 is one of the WORST ports I have played, the textures suck, it is badly optimized, it lags even though I should easily max it out, and worst of all, it has a memory bug that makes it unplayable after half an hour of play.  And yet, there is something deeply saisfying about starting a map, running up buildings and gliding to my heart's content.  The misison structure is boring, the characters and story unintersting at best (offensive at worst), and yet...There is something about this game and its prequel that I can't get over.  Even if I go back and play it for a couple of minutes every couple of months, there is something almost intoxicating about being an unbound, powerful, gliding machine that makes me not ever want to part ot it.  And so I can only hope that one day I can find a game that will satisfy that same primal need, but that I can play for more than thirty minutes at a time.			",302,38,6,31,8,0,50

												While this game is not without its flaws and shortcomings, I do recommend this game.  I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent inside of this game.  I actually preferred this one over the first Prototype.  The game does have memory leak issues.  After about an hour of play it would start to chug on my PC and sometimes just simply crash.  However, the game was still fun and I don't regret my purchase.  The story is a bit generic and they throw the same enemy types at you over and over again, but all in all I'm glad I played it.While I wouldn't drop full price on this game, if you are willing and able to preform some minor troubleshooting and restart it as needed the game is playable and enjoyable. Bottom line:The game is fun, the port is bad.			",131,33,3,16,3,2,13

												Do not pay $39.99 for this. It's a good game. Its fun. But with how crappy it runs on my capable computer and how old the game is I will have to say that if I paid $39.99 for this game I would feel ripped off. This is a great sandbox game. Controls are amazing once you get used to them. Leveling up will grant you godly abilities to run, leap and glide across the city, slaughtering countless people who get in your way. I havent completed the game yet, but I do not feel like it will be too too extensive. Just a fun, turn it on and screw around game. I get pulled into the side missions and trying to get a gold rating. Very fun stuff to fine tune your skills. Also you get exp and new mutations from completion. Making it very much worth it to stay on top of the side missions. If you see this game for $9.99 or less, I would strongly suggest buying it. Unless your computer sux.*Edit* Just found out that it was my AMD video card that is causing all the problems. I also found a thread with a fix for the memmory leak problem. Search it up in the community hub. Value of game just went up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game for people who haven't played the original Prototype 1 and highly recommend for those have completed Prototype 1!The visual and graphical effects on this game are simply amazing when compared to the original game and suprisinly easy to run for for computers a couple of years out of day!The storyline is alot stronger in Prototype 2 and you slowly watch yourself become stronger and stronger, whereas in Prototype 1 things were alot easier!Glad to see Alex Mercer as the antogonist for this series! You really start to hate this guys guts even though he was the protagonist for the orignal game!James Meller really is the true Prototype!10/10 for this game, wouldn't fault it and I didn't run into 1 bug throughout the entire gameplay!

												Prototype 2 is basically just more of the same. Some game mechanics have been slightly tweaked, but overall it's the same game with a different character.The story is paper thin and aside from the occasional insight into Blackwatch and the science teams fighting the infection, the story might as well not be there at all. Heller, like Mercer in the original game, has absolutely no regard for human life and basically turns into a killing machine the moment the game starts. Except for one situation in the game where he suddenly shows compassion for one single person. His one-liners are enjoyable but as a protagonist he does very little else to wow you.The virus, mutations, upgrades, weapons and shape shifting are the bread and butter of this game. 99% of the time you will be hacking, slashing and impaling Blackwatch soldiers and infected alike with your shape shifting blades and other goodies. As you progress through the game these weapons will become more and more powerful. If you take the time to do side missions this gets to a point where Heller becomes completely overpowered and is able to easily kill anything that gets in his way. Some upgrades even make you immune to small arms fire, making it possible to ignore the majority of the military all together while avoiding rockets.While this kind of power is very fun to play around with, it takes away just about any challenge the game had left to offer. Any enemy that can't be killed in 3 hits can easily be avoided and with a huge surplus of consumeable people around you will never (ever) run out of health. While I played the game on Normal, I can't imagine the game being any more challenging on Hard.It's still a very fun game to play around in. But if you are looking for a solid story or a game that offers a challenge then you best keep searching. This is basically a hack and slash version of GTA and nothing more. Recommended to get when it's on sale.			",79,15,1,8,28,2,10

												Plot is a mediocre retcon of the first, though the writing for the characters is good and manages to be entertaining. Gameplay is too easy, but the game gives you a ton of abilities to experiment with so it never manages to get boring during the 20 hours it takes to get 100%. Graphics and city design are better and more detailed than the first, though the city is now 3 zones separated by loading screens rather than being one large area.One of the better sandbox games this generation despite its flaws since it actually feels like a sandbox rather than an interactive movie where you do nothing but drive from point A to point B as is the case with most titles in the genre.

												I had a ton of fun in Prototype. I had just as much fun in Prototype 2. I would say the most notable differences between the two. Is that Prototype 2 has better controls and graphics. But the radnet dlc is not needed. Prototype 1 did this events in a better and more fun way. In either case. If you liked the first one, you will like this one. Its great for random destruction and for scratching that godcomplex itch we all have at times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really realy fun.  But it has a bug that causes it to crash every hour or so as it uses more and more of your RAM until it crashes.  The way around this is either restart the game every hour or change your resolution in game and then cancel it instead of confirming it to clear your RAM for another hour.  If you have a G510 keyboard like I do you can easily see how much RAM your computer is uses while still in game.			",119,21,1,26,3,0,4

												Okay, let me start off by saying: this game will make you feel like a god, it is incredibly fun, action packed with a decent story. SPOILERS BELOWIt starts off with you finding out that your daughter and wife were killed by these new Blackwatch soldiers, and as marine James Heller, you are thrown right at Alex Mercer at the very start of the game, later he injects you with his abilities (no, you dont get all of them all at once.... I know, i wish you did to) the Blackwatch soldiers capture you and figure out what makes you tick, fast forwarding a lot (to make this review a lot shorter), you find out that your daughter is still alive and was captured by Blackwatch, so what do you do? You got full on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy, you go after her... but are stopped by Alex Mercer himself, he is the final boss of the game.. and he is one of the BEST boss fights in video game history (in my opinion) it took me almost an hour to beat him, and that was probably a lot of tries, he adapts to some of your attacks and attack patterns, which makes this boss fight even more awesome, but when you beat him, believe me when i say it will feel so damn good, sorry im cursing, but there is no other way to really describe it, after you beat him you go get your daughter and rescue her, and the ending is very satisfying, my final rating for this is a 7/10, it is a great game, but there are several things the developers could have improved on, i highly reccomend this game, even if you dont know anything about the series, i enjoyed this game so much and i wish they would make a Prototype 3, but onfortunately the studio that made this no longer exists.

												Prototype 2 has a completely different playstyle as compared to 1 In terms of the ability tree. Unlike 1, P2 is much less confusing with less item on the power wheel and more focused on one-butten skills rather than P1's massive array of combo. However there's still cons when you actually spends time on this game. One such con would be equipping two ability for both mouse buttons. Prototype 2 does not have much of a combo and is more on the charged 1-hit to take out non-human targets. So having a second mouse button is next to useless if you're a power mixer. Right, even if you DO managed to fork out a combo, you've probably fail 3 in a 4 chance because the evolved were too fast or brawlers cannot be stunned during their onslaught. Last but not the least, removal of human disguise ability. Why!? D: the air strike was so fun, I know Heller wasn't as sly as Mercer so why did the air strike have to go with Patsy? T_T Gone with the con, it's getting long but the pro arrives! Heller's whipfist is an automatic field sweeping tool that is easy to use as compared to P1, although range is not as long. His's hammerfist doesn't have the rocket launch but makes up for it by having the stun ability to stun almost everything. Controls were much better whe gliding is much easier and vehicles were much better than before. There's much more pros but it's best to find them yourself as you enjoy the game.Additional details of the recommendation: I've recommended the game not only because of the story, but other features such as tearing off vehicle's secondary weapons and the side stories from those trucks. If you so happen to also consider getting the radnet pack, those are also a fun add-on to play with as it offers additional abilities that can assist you in the story further, or to let you screw up the game entirely once you're done.

												Honestly the game is fun, and much better looking than the first.Pros:Heller is much more relatable than Mercer was.Heller has more of a reason to be fighting.Way more enemie types and they don't just stand like dip♥♥♥♥♥.Events are more than just murder 6 million in 10 seconds, get xp, repeat.Cons:The game feels less responsive.Heller seems much slower and even running really fast it's hard to control.Going around the city just isn't as fun as it was in the first game, it feels like a chore.Combat is really slow, even the fast paced weapons like the Claws and Whip are super slow.They took my Armor and Super Fists away, those were my favorite parts of the First Game.There really was no set up to Mercer.Events can not be repeated, so once you've done it all, that's it.It's a fun game, and a Third Installment would have been good, get us back to being a Hero and not just some Biological weapon of destruction.Downside, story was forced as ♥♥♥♥. Mercer kills people for no reason, Mercer Kills me, I kill people for no reason, I kill Mercer. There was no legitimate build up to Mercer being evil. He just decided to be evil which was dumb.I recommend this game barely.			",158,16,3,26,8,0,10

												Just finished Prototype 2 last night, and I fully recommend it to anyone looking for a fun open-world action game that is not GTA.  The storyline moves along at a great pace, keeping power-ups and progression within an hour or two of each other.  There's no unnecessary padding to the main questline, something that really bogged down Darksiders 2 for me.  That being said, however, there are enough side missions to keep you busy for double the time I spent in game.  A couple of standouts for me include both the side missions and the powers at your, James Heller's, disposal.  First with the side missions.  I don't think I've found a game outside AAA RPGs like Mass Effect and Elder Scrolls where side missions were so beautifully related back to the main storyline.  Each mission involves another piece to the puzzle of the main storyline, fully fleshing out a bleak and believable alternate reality if you choose to do them.  Another cherry on that sundae is that every side mission serves to enhance a power that you already have- instant gratification.  No matter how much I wanted to stick to the main story, I couldn't stop doing the side missions.  And the powers.  Boy howdy, those powers.  Think Spawn had a devil's three-way with the Incredible Hulk and Predator.  Nowhere else have I felt like a force to be reckoned with, something that couldn't be stopped.  And then I died a bunch.  With every new mutation and bioweapon handed to you in game, along comes a new enemy variant that can slap you down without careful use of all your resources.  And never once did the game feel cheap- I just had to adjust my playstyle from what I had been using for the previous hour or two and the problem was completely manageable.  Bottom line- top marks for Prototype 2, a heartfelt and desperate journey of a loving father consumed with the dirty fires of revenge and bedlam. Try this one out if you like:-great sci-fi-a strong lead character-that game ""Hulk: Ultimate Destruction"" for PS2 and XBox-compulsive overeating to gain the strength of your enemies			",284,75,5,59,25,4,24

												So just to make the record clear on this... I spent many more than 7 hours in this game, but didn't have internet when I did most of it. Most not logged. It's virtually impossible to beat this game in 7 hours... Ultimately, this was an intense, gears of war meats mutation and spider-man's trek through new york, or some wannabe version of it, gorey experience of mayhem, destruction, and ""eating"" enemies to gain knowledge while contantly building on a sense of rage as life as one knows it changes from within him, til he finds the human instinct reclaiming the fabric of his sanity and trying to hold onto it so the paradise of childhood innocence can continue despite the horrors of the world wrapped in cherry syrup. Challenging, fun, really neat game. Definitely would recommend.			",60,1,0,12,6,0,6

												I wish this game has never been released because it completly ignores the first game and its plot.It also features terrible storyline (cringeworthy), a boring main protagonist (which is so sterotypical it makes me sick and I just can't like this guy), less combos than the first game, balance and all sorts of skill threw out of the window. Sure first game wasn't perfect but it had at least 3x more combos and moves than the second one. Also the first one had much better plot, than this abomination.PS:This game makes no sense if you played the first game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6 / 10The main character of Prototype 2 is James Heller, who is out for REVENGE! And won't stop telling you that every 5 minutes. He's also very angry. We can tell he's angry because he keeps saying f*@! every. Single. f*@!ing. Sentence.The game does a good job empowering the player with interesting and visceral mutations, which are gained by killing mutants that have powers you want. Power and ability progression is dealt with quite well mechanically and employing the various powers is rather fun. However, press the wrong button or take slightly too long to interact with a quick time event, which boss fights are unfortunately made of, and all that empowerment is stripped away for one jarring moment as the game remorselessly punishes you by stripping up to a quarter of your health away. Despoite the fact that you can punch helicopters out the sky and kick tanks to death.The story is an unfortunately flat follow up to Prototype 1, where Alex Mercer (the player character in Prototype 1) is suddenly, inexplicably, mustache twilingly, top hat wearing, puppy kickingly EVIL. He wasn't a nice person in the first game, but the sudden change in character is very jarring and poorly executed.""How do you know I'm EVIL James Heller? Because I will tell you so while twirling my mustache! Mwa ha ha! Let's take over the world together.""""No Alex Mercer! Mutants killed my fambly! You are a mutant so I shall kill you too. You f@""!ing emo.""The best character interaction Heller had was when he called Mercer emo. Which was unfortunately during one of the worst QTE fuelled boss fights I've had in years.

												If you have an Nvidia card- the game is awesome. Runs pretty well on most machines, graphics are neat and the gore is awesome. On my old Nvidia I never had a single problem with this game and I finished it twice. Hella lot of fun. If you liked Prototype 1 this is the game for you.If you have an ATI based card though... I mean Radeon... DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. To even get it to run you'll have to download an external GPU manager, not start the game through steam, download an uncut patch to get through the first cutscene, change the language allocation in the regedit, get rid of your modern GPU drivers and download v14.11 drivers to run this game at 15 FPS on a single core (because more crash it frequently, not that a single core helps), *breathes in*... don't buy it.

												An excellent sequel, Prototype 2 kept everything that was good about the first game and multiplied it by 2. The story is easier to follow and makes more sense plus you care about the main character more because he actually has a goal he must achieve, unlike mercer from the first game. the gameplay and graphics were also greatly improved, the missions have more structure and are better than the first game overall, graphics are good and the cutscenes are black and white with some colours, red and blue and they look great as a result. Prototype 2 has a great open world with lots of challenges and side missions and of course tons of blood and gore! it is a superior game in every way.			",214,33,5,16,16,1,25

Though what it doesn't fix is the crashing, the graphical bugs, the sh*t graphics, nor does it fix the sh*t game itself. The targeting system is a joke, it's repetative, and boring as hell. All the abilities are pretty much the same, this is THE WORST game in my library. If you have a Playstation, get Infamous (all the games are great). This is a 3/10.			",126,11,6,2,8,1,1

The RADNET Gauntlet Incineration Challenge was so difficult due to bad controls that I nearly had an aneurism.

												Remember all those nice things I said about Prototype 1? Well this game has all of that and more.The graphics are vastly improved. Prototype 1 looks like a PS2 game in comparison. The story isn't as good this time around though, as the plot seems very barebones and a lot of sh*t just plain doesn't make sense. I would also like to point out that I did get this feeling like the game was very ""disconnected"" from Prototype 1, in that it ignores or leaves behind a lot of the events that happened in the first game (for example, I don't think Elizabeth Greene is mentioned a single time). The final boss fight is amazing too a provides and adequate amount of challenge but it's worth noting that this game is overall much easier than the first. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it makes the freeroam MUCH more enjoyable, but the campaign itself did feel a little lacking due to the lower difficulty. Also, side note, I miss Alex Mercer's voice actor from the first Prototype.Anyway, just like the first game, Prototype 2 has fantastic sandboxing. This time around, there's 3 islands to go travel between, which includes the completely infection infested red zone. And just like Prototype 1, you can parkour around the city, murder the undead and play around with the military (you can still play ""Events"", but you need the Radnet DLC pack for them, which kinda sucks). One of my personal favorite things to do is go in the Red Zone and rescue hapless civilians from the streets by grabbing them and dropping them off safely at a rooftop. If you had a bad day at work, there's no better place to go than Prototype 2.My biggest problem with the first game was that vehicles kinda killed the fun of the game. Tanks spawned like crazy around you during freeroam and strike teams were called in like nobody's business. I'm happy to say that the problem's been fixed in this one; squads of tanks no longer spawn around you while you're just trying to have some fun and strike teams are much rarer and don't get called in in quick succession anymore. Furthermore, both seem to do less damage and are much easier to take out now, thanks to weaponizing them (ripping off the minigun/rocket launcher from the vehicle) or just grabbing onto them and using a finisher (which instantly destroys the tank/helicopter). Also, with the adjusted leveling system, as well as the introduction of mutations, you can truly feel unstoppable as you tear through enemy after enemy with your arsenal of biological abilities.With all that in mind, I think it goes without saying that Prototype 2 blows Prototype 1 out of the water in the spot for the ultimate bad*ss simulator.One last thing, I noticed a lot of people with AMD graphics cards are having issues with the game. I myself use NVIDIA so the problems are irrelevant to me but I feel I should still point out that people running games on an AMD should be careful and do some research before buying this game. Most of the negative reviews for Prototype 2, after all, are people who can't even get the game to run or start properly.			",56,5,0,10,2,1,7

												Gameplay wise more of the same from Prototype, you constantly fight the camera tho in cramed quarters.The story is a lot more shallow this time around. In the original you had a mystery, Mercer trying to solve what happened to him, the city around him and ultimately his new place in the world.In this game you start out as a angry, beefy black man and by the end of the game you are still a angry, beefy black man and everything was pretty predictable and nothing really happened. Grab it if you really enjoyed the original and want to play as a superdeadly virus some more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found this game, while deeply enjoyable, to be not quite as good as the original, and I'm having trouble figuring out why.  The characters are more interesting, the gameplay is more intuitive, the visual asthetic delivers the feel of a city truly experiencing a disaster of this level where the first game failed in that regard.  I suppose that my real problem is that Heller feels invincible, while Mercer felt very vulnerable in the first - and he survived a nuclear warhead from a few meters away.  The sandbox is smaller, the new enemies feel a little tacked on, and none of the bosses really inspire that gut wrenching terror that you got in the original Prototype (none of them made me want to toss my computer out the window either, and the first game definately brought me to that precipice).All in all, it really delivers a long, fulfilling and well rounded experience.  Oh yeah, and you can rip a tank in half with your bare hands if you level your character right.			",74,12,0,29,5,0,4

My only complaint comes from the story, which I won't spoil. But even with that this is still such an awesome game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 is similar to Prototype ""overall"" - ie: an open world sandbox where it's fun just doing whatever you want. The main problem with Prototype was that the first special offensive ability gained was pretty much all you needed to use for the rest of the game, so the other offensive abilities don't get much use. Prototype 2 is much more 'balanced' than the first in this respect, but now the game holds off giving you the (overpowered) offensive ability from the first game, until ""after"" the final battle - meaning that there is nobody left worth using it on!That aside, it is a fun sandbox game with just enough to keep people coming back after the campaign is completed...

												This time we're hunting Zeus! I mean Alex!Graphics are sort of PS2 or PS3-ish, not the best. Crappy textures, crappy polygon count. But a beautiful game none the less. Thank you, HLSL!Soundwise: meh, voice acting is decent. Hard to say when almost everything is this unemotional military speak.Gameplay is amazing! Very graphical violence, I like it! Fights are fluid and fun. You still have this feeling of godly power, but fighting bigger enemies is a ton of fun!One thing: this game has a memory leak bug. Since the team around Prototype 2 have been dissolved you will not see any offical patches for this, so here is what it is: RAM is being filled up until ~3.5GB and the game crashes. Fix: minimize the game every 1-2h once. Yes, this fixes the problem.Still an amazing game! Did not regret a single minute! BUY IT! NOW!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:- Story and missions are funny and intresting.- Everythings works. Havent seen bugs or crashing which is good.- I like the way movies are made in this game. This could be movie too.Cons:- Performance issues. Graphics are nice but shouldnt require better GPU than gtx 970 which cant handle 60 fps in all situations even i dropped some settings.Compared to first game this feels like the gravity is working in game and everything feels heavier and bigger. In first one you could throw cars easily to helicopters but in this one its not possible anymore. Many other things have got better in this one too. I would say the Prototype 1 is 6/10 game but this is 8/10. One point goes because bad porting. Works perfectly with Xbox one controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Protype 2 is just fun. The combat is straightforward and it makes you feel like a badass. The story is garbage, especially if you've play the first one, and really Saints Row IV does this kind of game much better. But ripping stuff apart wit my razor blade arms is frigging cool.

												I am usually not a fan of parkour-based FPS games, as they often require a lot of coordination.  Nevertheless, this game is different than games like Dying Light as far as parkour, which is a breeze in Prototype 2.  The RADNET DLC is a must-have for more casual gamers given the incredible abilities it can provide.There is certainly a storyline, though it is rather predictable.  Nevertheless, I find the gameplay is absolutely amazing and I reallly enjoy the destruction one can create on such a massive scale!  As far as the original Prototype, I played it for a bit, but personally I feel Prototype 2 has a richness the original lacks.Nonetheless, that is simply my personal opinion.  Being an older and more casual gamer, I tend to gravitate towards games with difficulties that can be more easily scaled like this one.   After only a day of playing, I knew this would end up on my ""Favorites"" list.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How to describe this game... erm...Take a ""sandbox"" style ""opencity"" game. With a hundreds... well... thousands people inside.Then add a virus. Classical one. A virus, which is changing people into murderous monsters!Then... of course... add secret goverment agency... with a very brutal effectivity when solving such a situation.So... You have a giant city, partly overtaken by virus, partly taken by military.And somewhere between it... is You. Former soldier, who is hunting a hero of the Prototype 1. A living virus itself in a form of human. And... as You maybe expected... he will infect You. And allow You to change your body parts and body itself to the bio-weapon-of-mass-destruction!...plus add that you can devour any human and transphorm to him/her.In result... very funny, very violent, GTA style biohazard game : )			",130,32,1,5,7,0,8

												I didn't find this game as rewarding as the first. While there was considerable expansion to the powers and the abilities, the game length was somewhat short. The storyline was not very cathartic, but that is a completely subjective judgement.Pros:Good GraphicsFast ActionGood use of standard blend of powers.Open worldCons: Seems to be having trouble running on modern systems.Open World is very static.Side Missions become repetitive very quickly.Confusing storyline delivered through questionable menu.All in all, the whole game seems like a redo of the first, with less work put into matching the story to the side missions and using the latter as a generic skeleton to hang a thin coating of story over. Saints Row IV did similar. The people are even more distant and inaccessible from the players point of view, and the game's response to the player is limited, so it becomes very simple to determine what will happen, and the military always seems to be keen to open fire on you often sometimes without reason.Is it fun? Yes. Is it worth the price?I would get it on sale.A big sale. ",345,28,0,28,28,1,86

												Gameplay wise more of the same from Prototype, you constantly fight the camera tho in cramed quarters.The story is a lot more shallow this time around. In the original you had a mystery, Mercer trying to solve what happened to him, the city around him and ultimately his new place in the world.In this game you start out as a angry, beefy black man and by the end of the game you are still a angry, beefy black man and everything was pretty predictable and nothing really happened. Grab it if you really enjoyed the original and want to play as a superdeadly virus some more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 is a rather exciting game! The characters are awesome,the powers are friggin awesome! (I'm looking at you WhipFist!) everything is awesome in this game! Now,It definitely does not match up to the first game,but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get it! Now there is one problem with the game.....it has severe memory leaks. Incase you don't know what those are,memory leaks cause the game to use up more memory without expelling excess memory. Basically,it lags,FPS goes down ALOT,and it crashes. Not your typical lag,it makes the game unplayable. However,this problem is only on the PC version. If you want the game,get it for the XBox360/PS3! To sum it all up,get the game,but not for PC. It will consume hours of your day!Have fun!			",36,4,0,0,4,0,1

												Life got you down?  Could you use a good power trip?  Want to play a character that can throw cars, run up buildings, leap and glide long distances, devour your foes then disguise yourself as them to infiltrate their world, and turn your arms into powerful weaponry?  Look no further than Prototype 2.One warning: this one's definitely not for the kiddies - this game is full of mayhem, and the main character uses cuss words liberally.  Prototype 2 is open-world, with a main story, many branching side-stories, and lots of bonuses to earn you more POWER!  You start out incredibly powerful, then proceed to ridiculously so - run up a building, leap from the top to the combat chopper that's blasting you, chuck the pilot out the window and take it over yourself, or just leap out and glide, watching the chopper drop to the ground.  Or, after devouring (with tendrils) a biowarfare scientist spreading the plague, run through the city in your lab coat, chucking cars at the Infected monsters.  You have definite missions along each story path, but a lot of freedom on how you want to do it - do you disguise yourself and quietly infiltrate, or decorate the walls?  Do you protect the public to the best of your ability, or drive your tank OVER rush-hour traffic?  You're not forced to be a good guy or a bad guy, though overall your goal is to end the bioengineered plague spreading throughout the city, turning people into monsters.Now that I've also played Prototype 1, I can say that 2 improved upon the gameplay greatly, and the beginning catches you up on that story.This is a great game to play when you've had a bad day.P.S. I defeated the game and earned all the DLC rewards I could on the PS3 before my YLOD ended that - I've only just begun on the Steam version, and it's even better!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I mean Radeon... DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. To even get it to run you'll have to download an external GPU manager, not start the game through steam, download an uncut patch to get through the first cutscene, change the language allocation in the regedit, get rid of your modern GPU drivers and download v14.11 drivers to run this game at 15 FPS on a single core (because more crash it frequently, not that a single core helps), *breathes in*... don't buy it.

												Like the first Prototype, this game allows the player to kill everyone in a multitude of very satisfying ways. It's too bad some features from the original aren't there this time around- air strikes, patsy, armor, and hanging onto walls like Spider-Man, to name a few. Unfortunately, it's impossible to get all upgrades in one playthrough so if you're looking to fully upgrade Heller, be prepared to play the story twice. Boss fights start out hard encounters but after acquiring many upgrades, Heller can go to town on them like nobody's business. There are even upgrades that let you destroy tanks and helicopters with one button after hijacking them. In the rare case you get overwhelmed in a fight, just summon your pack of Brawler Hunters and you win. The only real challenges are the Goliaths and the last boss fight.

												Loved this game. Yes it has a memory leak for pc but dont let that discourage you! The game changes up some things from the first game that didnt work well. One was the minigames; screw those and just have them integrated into the missions. Make enemies easier to consume when they're at low health. Have new game changing abilities, all of which you will use and be encouraged to use. A little more help to get you through the game easier. It might seem like a little much at first but believe me as someone who is a slow learner, it's worthwhile. I loved the perk system and level up system. Unfortunately there isnt a counter for body count anymore or any reason to randomly kill military but you get everything with the second playthrough as long as you do some searching around the city. One suggestion that I wish I knew going into the game: THE MAP HELPS YOU FIND BLACK BOXES, DENS, AND FIELD TEAMS! The general area is pinged on the map if you have something undiscovered. Use this info to your advantage! It can be found under collectibles in the map tabs.My favorite ability is the Bio-Bomb! I literally spent 2 hours alone playing around with it. There is also a RadNet change to it that allows you to kick those you bio-bomb square in the♥♥♥♥♥toward your target! It's fantastic. It allows me to stealth missions easier while removing detectors to move around easier. I used it a lot to stealth kill tanks and helicopters ahead of time for missions. Totally the most useful skill out of combat and can be used for fun in combat as well.Happy hunting!			",91,12,0,15,12,2,11

												This is a very entertaining game in how you can interact with the open world environment however the sandbox nature of it gets redundant after a while.  I felt like I kept doing the same exact things over and over with the only changes being as you evolve more powers.  The boss fights aren't even remotely challenging and so it's a run around the world and smash whatever you want type of game.  Fun for a few hours and I might come back to it if I get bored, but it really lacks depth.			",286,44,5,39,19,0,29

												Prototype 2 is fun to play. Prototype 2's story and characters are fun to ignore. The comparisons to the Infamous series are apt - both are games about genetic mutants being hunted down by insidious government organisations, and fighting back for their freedom and the truth. Both also contain protagonists that are pretty unlikable, although Prototype makes no attempt to try and morally pigeonhole your character. While the first Prototype is rather clunky and dated both technically and graphically, Prototype 2 is a significant improvement on both fronts. However, like the first game, Prototype 2 is still full of trite dialogue, repetitious gameplay and a plot that tries for complex and dramatic but comes off as convoluted and melodramatic. The player character is a vicious, angry piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥who is supposedly motivated by the death of his wife and child, but is (and I suspect always was) a callous psychopath. Your character is told about 6 hours in to be careful of losing his humanity. I then continued to slaughter innocent and guilty alike, just I had for the entire 6 hours up until that point. The good news is that the game makes few attempts to cover up the fact that it's basically a playground for the player to commit innumerable brutal, violent atrocities against anyone standing in their way. The game doesn't hold back when it comes to gore, and the player is given a large range of powers almost straight away, so you can expect to be running, jumping, gliding, and tearing opponents (or civilians, if you feel so inclined) limb-from-limb from the moment you set foot in the world.In reality there is only one type of mission in the game - you consume a person, gain information from them that leads you to another person, place or thing, and then you destroy that person, place, or thing and escape the area by disguising yourself. Bar some minor collecting, everything else that happens is some variation on this, which would be a bad thing if you weren't given the freedom to wreak havoc with impunity. The enemies are basically blind, and all you have to do is turn a corner and disguise yourself and you're a free man, not to mention the fact that you can consume people who are standing right next to someone else as if peripheral vision doesn't exist in this world. But this just serves to lighten the restrictions on the player.I wouldn't recommend the first game, but I would recommend this as a guilty pleasure. Be aware that it does get repetitive, so get it cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright, so this games' technical support does not exists although pleeeenty of users complained about problems.BUT if you get this game to work, which in my case was achieved by http://steamcommunity.com/app/115320/discussions/0/792924952898071369/?tscn=1385221324#c648811126590200376 << this forum post, it is really worth your while.The atmosphere is dark and hopeless but still inspiring to continue your work through this hell of a damned city in order to make it a little better. Story is also good, this is a brilliant part II to the previous prototype  and the gametechniques are the best for the vast and cool slay & slash moments.Playing got me really much fun and without the annoying parts in the beginning when you just try to get the game running, I would definetly recommend this game.

												Plot is a mediocre retcon of the first, though the writing for the characters is good and manages to be entertaining. Gameplay is too easy, but the game gives you a ton of abilities to experiment with so it never manages to get boring during the 20 hours it takes to get 100%. Graphics and city design are better and more detailed than the first, though the city is now 3 zones separated by loading screens rather than being one large area.One of the better sandbox games this generation despite its flaws since it actually feels like a sandbox rather than an interactive movie where you do nothing but drive from point A to point B as is the case with most titles in the genre.

												Heads up: there is a memory leak issue with this game, but a fix is on the forums. Having said that, even /with/ the leak unfixed I would still reccomend this over Prototype 1. -The city is smaller but everything is much more varied and vibrant and interesting so its more enjoyable to move around in. -Combat is less obnoxious and you can fluidly mix in different mutation attacks rather than select one 'mode' at a time-Upgrades are less unique than in P1, but since half the interesting stuff you would have bought in P1 is given to you either by default or during the story...-Side missions are way more fun!-Rnet lets you get different skins and screw with the game's physics.

												Has the game got problems.  Oh yes.  Yes it does.  Problems with the framerate, problems with crashing.  The real shame is that these problems haven't been patched out yet.  The real kick in the nuts is that Activision doesn't even list the game on their website anymore; it's like they're trying to deny it ever happened.  However, if you can get past these issues (and they're not insignificant), the gameplay itself is at least as good as the original Prototype.			",152,7,0,28,6,0,24

												Prototype 2 is basically just more of the same. Some game mechanics have been slightly tweaked, but overall it's the same game with a different character.The story is paper thin and aside from the occasional insight into Blackwatch and the science teams fighting the infection, the story might as well not be there at all. Heller, like Mercer in the original game, has absolutely no regard for human life and basically turns into a killing machine the moment the game starts. Except for one situation in the game where he suddenly shows compassion for one single person. His one-liners are enjoyable but as a protagonist he does very little else to wow you.The virus, mutations, upgrades, weapons and shape shifting are the bread and butter of this game. 99% of the time you will be hacking, slashing and impaling Blackwatch soldiers and infected alike with your shape shifting blades and other goodies. As you progress through the game these weapons will become more and more powerful. If you take the time to do side missions this gets to a point where Heller becomes completely overpowered and is able to easily kill anything that gets in his way. Some upgrades even make you immune to small arms fire, making it possible to ignore the majority of the military all together while avoiding rockets.While this kind of power is very fun to play around with, it takes away just about any challenge the game had left to offer. Any enemy that can't be killed in 3 hits can easily be avoided and with a huge surplus of consumeable people around you will never (ever) run out of health. While I played the game on Normal, I can't imagine the game being any more challenging on Hard.It's still a very fun game to play around in. But if you are looking for a solid story or a game that offers a challenge then you best keep searching. This is basically a hack and slash version of GTA and nothing more. Recommended to get when it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

English:Danger!! Who will take this game can probably set you in advance to problems and work, as it (almost) running in German, violent impaired version not at all! For me it has always first suspended after the first video despite the lowest graphics settings and very powerful PC and when it has then eventually went on randomly (after about 10 attempts) no longer reported directly in the next load screen back!But there is to this common problem a solution: You may just get the simple (unfortunately for me only English) Uncut patch and thus has even the (advantage) it is even more brutal than anyway. Searches just a bit on the Internet or in Steam Reviews / forums. There, I also have a YouTube video found that even stated next to the uncut patch then how to get the game back German, but the latter has in me, unfortunately, does not work because I do not know how I did not start the game over / with Steam.So if you have the now attempt it and apart from this drawback I come now to the actual game Review:AWESOME!Deutsch:Achtung!!!!! Wer sich dieses Spiel holt kann sich wahrscheinlich schonmal auf Probleme und Arbeit einstellen, da es in der deutschen, gewaltgeminderten Version (fast) garnicht läuft!!! Bei mir hat es sich zuerst immer nach dem ersten Video trotz niedrigster Grafikeinstellung und sehr leistungsstarkem PC aufgehängt und als es dann irgendwann (nach ca. 10 Versuchen) zufällig weiterging hat es sich direkt beim nächsten Ladebildschirm nicht mehr zurück gemeldet!Doch es gibt für dieses häufig auftretende Problem eine Lösung: Man holt sich einfach den (leider bei mir nur englischen) Uncut-Patch und hat somit sogar noch den (Vorteil) das es noch brutaler ist als sowieso schon. Sucht einfach ein bisschen im Internet oder in Steamreviews/-foren. Dort hab auch ich ein YouTube-Video gefunden welches neben dem Uncut-Patch sogar erklärt wie man das Spiel dann wieder deutsch kriegt, doch letzteres hat bei mir leider nicht funktioniert, da ich nicht weiß wie ich das Spiel nicht über/mit Steam starte. So wenn man das jetzt hingekriegt hat und von diesem Nachteil absieht komm ich nun zum eigentlichen Spielreview: AWESOME!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is way more fun than it has any right to be. The plot and characterization is reminescent of recent Michael Bay movies. It's just a hodge podge of nonsenical reasons for you to blow things up, a borderline racist depiction of a black main character, and a peppering super sexualized supporting characters. The dialogue oozes with the maturity of teenage focus group testing and is the kind of thing I may have thought was amazing when I was in middle school. Everything about Prototype 2's story is a vast step backward from Prototype.Despite all of that, I still had a blast, because the mechanics of the game feel good. They make you feel powerful. Thankfully, there is no pretense of heroism throughout most of Prototype 2, so  you never feel guilty about using and abusing every bipedal meat buffet in your vicinity. It wants you to wreck everything around you, and makes it feel good to do so. It's better than the original Prototype because many design concessions have been made for the sake of playability. Rockets are now telegraphed by a laser and a beeping sound you will hear long after you stop playing the game. Upgrades are handled differently and the majority of them are awards for completing side objectives that are surprisingly fun to complete. This means that the collectible component in most free roaming games is actually meaningful in this game.All in all, a fantastic experience.			",180,12,1,27,1,0,16

												This game is way more fun than it has any right to be. The plot and characterization is reminescent of recent Michael Bay movies. It's just a hodge podge of nonsenical reasons for you to blow things up, a borderline racist depiction of a black main character, and a peppering super sexualized supporting characters. The dialogue oozes with the maturity of teenage focus group testing and is the kind of thing I may have thought was amazing when I was in middle school. Everything about Prototype 2's story is a vast step backward from Prototype.Despite all of that, I still had a blast, because the mechanics of the game feel good. They make you feel powerful. Thankfully, there is no pretense of heroism throughout most of Prototype 2, so  you never feel guilty about using and abusing every bipedal meat buffet in your vicinity. It wants you to wreck everything around you, and makes it feel good to do so. It's better than the original Prototype because many design concessions have been made for the sake of playability. Rockets are now telegraphed by a laser and a beeping sound you will hear long after you stop playing the game. Upgrades are handled differently and the majority of them are awards for completing side objectives that are surprisingly fun to complete. This means that the collectible component in most free roaming games is actually meaningful in this game.All in all, a fantastic experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 isn't as fun (or novel) as the first one, but it's still satisfying to use your super-powers to blast enemies and cruise around the city.  The controls are occasionally frustrating (frequently targetting the wrong enemy, or picking up a barrel when you want to target an enemy), but the game is forgiving enough (on Normal difficulty) that it was no problem to recover from bad situations.

												Pros: Great Combat/Good Storyline/Great Graphics/semi repetitive/sidequests helps the story along while upgrading your abilities/ NEW GAME PLUSCons: Horrid pc port/Horrid Lock on targetting system/Protagonist sounds like he was written by a 12 yrs old who only know of black people through stereotypes or adults for that matter.It was very hard to root for the Protagonist named Heller (i guess he was named that because he was going to give them hell?) the writer made him as insufferable as possible. Do not expect him to be the same guy from the cinematic trailers. Spoilers: Mercer has been the bad guy since the 1st game, that was well established, he unleashed a virus that killed millions because he was nutters. Its too damned bad they werent able to create a game wherein you can choose to side with Mercer or destroy him, they didnt explore Hellers military background, so much so i feel bad for the civilians in this game, nobody cares for them, not the Marines or BlackStar/Watch or the 2 prototypes. One can actually argue Mercer cares for the people more than Heller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game runs like donkey♥♥♥♥♥on AMD cards DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE AN AMD CARD SERIOUSLY DON'T DO IT. The frame rate starts off fluctuations and then steadily degrades as you keep playing it. Activision will never fix this because they are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥On Nvidia hardware the game still runs less than stellar with some weird stuttering issues. It's playable though.The game is a weird sequel since it really doesn't do much better than the first game beyond the graphics. The side missions are still lame mini-games and the gameplay actually takes longer to get good since the progression system starts you off with SLOW AS HELL speed. The story though is an improvement though since instead of a story about a lame dude with amnesia, it's a revenge tale centered on Barret's journey to kill motha♥♥♥♥as who waxed his daughter and main ho (yep, they couldn't just make a regular black dude).All in all, the game is pretty worth it for the destruction and murder you get to wreak all over the place. It is the best power-fantasy game you will ever play (sadly, as the dev studio was closed shortly after the release of this game). P.S. Screw Activision			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good hacking slashing brawl with ideas.... but if you are using a AMD card, I recommend you to not buy this game or you will crash every 15 minutes or soPros:A nice health system where you regen health by consuming people and taking there disguise.Nice movement system but at first it abit weird, i recommend upgrading it first.You gain new powers at certain missions which open up the combat: There are human types that die quickly and can be consumed then there the 1v1 types that require your powers to stun then or other things.The random upgrade system works well; You either sneak up on them and consume them, grab them and consume them, if they are a 1v1 enemy beat them up and then consume then but your enemies like killing them.The powers are nice.Cons:I recommend doing story missions to gain all of the powersYou can pick up guns but the targeting system is hard to use, and if you want to use your powers you drop your guns, you cant hold any guns.The tanks and helicopter suck since you are a mortal god.When 3 or more 1v1 enemies come out, it is annoying as they need you to focus on them but they rush youAt the beginning, your health dont regen unless you eat itThe side missions are cool but you need to often hunt a target to do the mission, The audio logs are hard to find sometimes.Heller isnt the great protaginst and is genericThe missions you got to stay in disguise and use guns against 1v1 enemies get annoying.Amd video cards cause the game to crash or freeze up like there is no tomorrowI recommend this game but make sure you dont have a AMD, It a pretty good sandbox game ",101,4,0,7,3,2,5

												Prototpe 2 feels like a much better version of prototype. Some examples: what i didn't like in prototype was that you have an open world but nothing is really happening in this world besides the military and the infected. The civilians were just wandering around pointlessly. In prototype 2 the civilians talk to each other about the infection and about blackwatch killing civilians which drags you as the player way deeper in this scenario.Another thing i didn' like in prototype was that the combat wasn't really dynamic you chose one power at the start and if you wanted to change it you needed to access the menu. In prototype 2 you can select 2 powers on your 2 mouse keys. For example you can make left click a claw attack and right click a tendril attack which improves the combat system alot because you can now be more creative in killing enemies.In prototype 2 the NY is divided in 3 different zones depending on the level of infection in this zone. There is the green, yellow and red zone. All these zones feel unique because of the way the artists designed them. For example in the yellow zone you got demonstrations against blackwatch and civilians in cages while in the red zone you find infected wandering around everywhere a lot of destroyed buildings.In prototype 2 the evolution of the protagonist isn't done with spending ep for new moves anymore. It's more like in a RPG you get ep and after you have enough you get a level up which grants you a point that you can spend in different categories.There are also other ""mutations"" that you get after completing certain events in a package or finishing //BLACKNET-Missions.Your powers and skills to work with weapons or vehicles get upgraded by consuming marked targets with an ""strong-arm-symbol"" over their head.To sum it all up prototype 2 is a different appraoch to the prototype franchise then prototype. If you liked prototype 1 you should definately play prototype 2.			",150,8,2,12,12,0,9

												Loved this game. Yes it has a memory leak for pc but dont let that discourage you! The game changes up some things from the first game that didnt work well. One was the minigames; screw those and just have them integrated into the missions. Make enemies easier to consume when they're at low health. Have new game changing abilities, all of which you will use and be encouraged to use. A little more help to get you through the game easier. It might seem like a little much at first but believe me as someone who is a slow learner, it's worthwhile. I loved the perk system and level up system. Unfortunately there isnt a counter for body count anymore or any reason to randomly kill military but you get everything with the second playthrough as long as you do some searching around the city. One suggestion that I wish I knew going into the game: THE MAP HELPS YOU FIND BLACK BOXES, DENS, AND FIELD TEAMS! The general area is pinged on the map if you have something undiscovered. Use this info to your advantage! It can be found under collectibles in the map tabs.My favorite ability is the Bio-Bomb! I literally spent 2 hours alone playing around with it. There is also a RadNet change to it that allows you to kick those you bio-bomb square in the♥♥♥♥♥toward your target! It's fantastic. It allows me to stealth missions easier while removing detectors to move around easier. I used it a lot to stealth kill tanks and helicopters ahead of time for missions. Totally the most useful skill out of combat and can be used for fun in combat as well.Happy hunting!			",91,12,0,15,12,2,11

												This game has plenty going for it. Good story, character building, reaction times, and who doesn't like killing diseased zombies. It's kind of like GTA super villain edition. Where does the character Heller place himself in the midst of vast corruption in the government, corporation, and the rebels? You can explore, drive tanks, fly helicopters, fly (glide), use weapons which are attached and detached with special manouvers. Now for the Con, and it's a big one... It would seem when they ported the game over to PC, the developers didn't think about memory management. A memory leak!!! The application seems to handle up to a 4gb ram allocation. Anything more and it locks up and abnormally ends. I have 16 gb and really enjoyed Prototype I so this wouldn't stop me. I found you can keep an eye on the physical memory in task manager, displayed on your second monitor. Prior to that threshold (for me it was at 7.1gb (you will need to identify your own as you may have more or less applications running than I do), you can alt+tab out of the game and then go back in. In doing it this way, windows will clean up the memory leaked until it builds up again. It definately adds a challenge.			",165,15,1,12,12,0,28

												Bloody FunIf you want to be a super-powered behemoth with no regard for human life, tearing through a devastated NYC with an assortment of violent super-powers, then look no further. If you played the first one you'll know what to expect, just bigger, and more. I found this game fun, neither too challenging nor too easy. It didn't make me think, it didn't ask me to make choices, it just gave me things to smash in hilarious and exciting ways. The characters and plot are laughably bad, and I actually really enjoyed them in a B-movie kind of way. About half way through I did start skipping through every cinematic, but this in no way affected my understanding or enjoyment of the game.A great game to play after a hard day if you want to just turn off and laugh (hopefully with a friend, the co-op was surprisingly fun!)

												Prototype 2 isn't as fun (or novel) as the first one, but it's still satisfying to use your super-powers to blast enemies and cruise around the city.  The controls are occasionally frustrating (frequently targetting the wrong enemy, or picking up a barrel when you want to target an enemy), but the game is forgiving enough (on Normal difficulty) that it was no problem to recover from bad situations.

												though i noticed many complaining about game i left it on my wishlist and recieved it, thanks to my bab :) ... it runs fine on my older system 2.3 ghrtz duo core, evga 8600 2 gigs ram - in fact i have the aa all the way up and everything else on low and it looks incredible. the first 30 minutes of the game are filled with enough high quality production and imagery, for me, to warrant the cost of this game. i especially liked the 'RUN!' segment with the first monster, both visually and the way the camera shifted, showing only you running toward the cam and the monster chasing you. as i played on i felt that a controller would benefit certain types of players, though i would prefer a controller i am adept enough at mouse/kb to play just fine. a slight sound issue in some of the cutscenes, but i have a few other games with the same error, which i relate to my own hardware and software configuration- NOT the makers of the game itself.

												This is basically what Radical Entertainment's plan is for each Prototype game: Kill, Consume, Repeat. Basically, that's all you do, but it's better than nothing. Glitches could be anywhere (for example, a Blackwatch soldier decided to shoot his own commander, then proceed to start humping a tank), but could be funnier than Krusty the Klown from the Simpsons. 9/10 Story, 10/10 Weapon variety, 10/10 graphics, Infinite/10 glitch hilarity (please never fix those), and finally, 7/10 enemy variety.

												It was certainly worth the 13$ I paid for it, but the game does drone on a bit and the ending is just lacking. The game basically tells you approximately where each collectible item is, so you don't have to search the net or spend forever hunting them. The combat is simple and enjoyable. The story is boring and the dialogue is awful. I didn't bother trying the game with Keyboard & Mouse, I just figured it'd be best with a controller... as these sorts of games tend to be.

												Prototype 2 is a phenominal continuation of the first game. The mechanics from the first prototype were carried over an enahnced with amazing combos and new mutations that makes james heller the most elite killing meachine.There is hours of gameplay mixed in with dozens of mini games and hidden collectables to enhance heller's power and make him godlike. The storyline to prototype has always been phenominal and does not need prototype 1 to know what is going on. The game does fairly decent job as explaining what has happened. Some of the key highlights is that the play can now use 2 power at once intertwined in combos to make heller a devestating killing machine and you can summon brawlers to your aid. The only con to this game is that it frequently crashed and saving every 5 minutes was required. Overall this game comes highly reccomended when on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 1 was pretty ""difficult"". You had to remember a awefull lot of combinations for the attack moves. Like in old fighting games like Mortal Combat and co.The gameplay is heavily simplified. THAT is not a bad thing. Really. The story is ""O.K"". Some improvements here and there. Some little things went worse. The ""Parque-Movement"" is now lame. The first game was a little smoother in the movementabilitys. However it was fun and is a great addition to the first game it think.If you liked the first part, you wont regret this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really realy fun.  But it has a bug that causes it to crash every hour or so as it uses more and more of your RAM until it crashes.  The way around this is either restart the game every hour or change your resolution in game and then cancel it instead of confirming it to clear your RAM for another hour.  If you have a G510 keyboard like I do you can easily see how much RAM your computer is uses while still in game.			",119,21,1,26,3,0,4

												Bloody FunIf you want to be a super-powered behemoth with no regard for human life, tearing through a devastated NYC with an assortment of violent super-powers, then look no further. If you played the first one you'll know what to expect, just bigger, and more. I found this game fun, neither too challenging nor too easy. It didn't make me think, it didn't ask me to make choices, it just gave me things to smash in hilarious and exciting ways. The characters and plot are laughably bad, and I actually really enjoyed them in a B-movie kind of way. About half way through I did start skipping through every cinematic, but this in no way affected my understanding or enjoyment of the game.A great game to play after a hard day if you want to just turn off and laugh (hopefully with a friend, the co-op was surprisingly fun!)

												This game has plenty going for it. Good story, character building, reaction times, and who doesn't like killing diseased zombies. It's kind of like GTA super villain edition. Where does the character Heller place himself in the midst of vast corruption in the government, corporation, and the rebels? You can explore, drive tanks, fly helicopters, fly (glide), use weapons which are attached and detached with special manouvers. Now for the Con, and it's a big one... It would seem when they ported the game over to PC, the developers didn't think about memory management. A memory leak!!! The application seems to handle up to a 4gb ram allocation. Anything more and it locks up and abnormally ends. I have 16 gb and really enjoyed Prototype I so this wouldn't stop me. I found you can keep an eye on the physical memory in task manager, displayed on your second monitor. Prior to that threshold (for me it was at 7.1gb (you will need to identify your own as you may have more or less applications running than I do), you can alt+tab out of the game and then go back in. In doing it this way, windows will clean up the memory leaked until it builds up again. It definately adds a challenge.			",165,15,1,12,12,0,28

I had it crash on me three times since I installed it... -yesterday-.Otherwise the gameplay is solid, the graphics are nice, the combat is well thought out, and I love how the cutscenes are done all artsy black and white Sin City style.One small niggle I do have though is this: Why the hell did Activision change how the stealth devour works? There was nothing wrong with holding down RB and then pressing Y. Now you have to press B and Y together and if you time it even a little off you'll choke the guy (and usually fail the mission because you were supposed to be sneaky).			",223,78,1,67,20,2,24

												Like the first Prototype, this game allows the player to kill everyone in a multitude of very satisfying ways. It's too bad some features from the original aren't there this time around- air strikes, patsy, armor, and hanging onto walls like Spider-Man, to name a few. Unfortunately, it's impossible to get all upgrades in one playthrough so if you're looking to fully upgrade Heller, be prepared to play the story twice. Boss fights start out hard encounters but after acquiring many upgrades, Heller can go to town on them like nobody's business. There are even upgrades that let you destroy tanks and helicopters with one button after hijacking them. In the rare case you get overwhelmed in a fight, just summon your pack of Brawler Hunters and you win. The only real challenges are the Goliaths and the last boss fight. Prototype 2 is still a very fun game though.			",70,14,0,12,1,0,6

												Loved this game. Yes it has a memory leak for pc but dont let that discourage you! The game changes up some things from the first game that didnt work well. One was the minigames; screw those and just have them integrated into the missions. Make enemies easier to consume when they're at low health. Have new game changing abilities, all of which you will use and be encouraged to use. A little more help to get you through the game easier. It might seem like a little much at first but believe me as someone who is a slow learner, it's worthwhile. I loved the perk system and level up system. Unfortunately there isnt a counter for body count anymore or any reason to randomly kill military but you get everything with the second playthrough as long as you do some searching around the city. One suggestion that I wish I knew going into the game: THE MAP HELPS YOU FIND BLACK BOXES, DENS, AND FIELD TEAMS! The general area is pinged on the map if you have something undiscovered. Use this info to your advantage! It can be found under collectibles in the map tabs.My favorite ability is the Bio-Bomb! I literally spent 2 hours alone playing around with it. There is also a RadNet change to it that allows you to kick those you bio-bomb square in the♥♥♥♥♥toward your target! It's fantastic. It allows me to stealth missions easier while removing detectors to move around easier. I used it a lot to stealth kill tanks and helicopters ahead of time for missions. Totally the most useful skill out of combat and can be used for fun in combat as well.Happy hunting!			",91,12,0,15,12,2,11

You really start to hate this guys guts even though he was the protagonist for the orignal game!James Meller really is the true Prototype!10/10 for this game, wouldn't fault it and I didn't run into 1 bug throughout the entire gameplay!

												Great game if you're into alot of gore. I do reccomend Prototype 1 over Prototype 2. But it's a worthy sequel. Want blood? want zombies? want to create your own shapeshifting maniac? this is your game 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is 32 bit meaning cannot use more than 4GBs and has a very serious memory leak problem. Just remember alt+tabbing from time to time, you'll manually free up enough memory to go on, I see it as a part of the game ;) This is a very good and gory game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worthy sequel to the 1st game. Fixes the few annoying bits of the 1st game (the repetitive base infiltration segments that ended up all feeling the same) and adds even more enjoyable & destructive modes. The story is nearly as good as in the original due to fact while it doesn't have the same crazy twist, you do get to turn the tables on the previous anti-hero and main character of the previous game as Alex Mercer is now the main villain and you end up having a kick♥♥♥♥♥epic battle against him.I also have to say that I'm a bit biased as there are very few games where the main character is black and well-done, and being a black man I'm always looking for more cultural diversity in my games. So it helps that while being a one dimensional-character James Heller is pretty decent as far as characters go. It would have been nice though to have him interact more with his daughter as at times it doesn't feel like she's a big part of his life or the main reason why he's fighting and he can come off as just another really angry black man.The gameplay is akin to that in the first game as you can run up buildings, toss cars, glide across rooftops and from on end of the city to the other as you become more powerful and run at such speeds through the streets of NYC that the ground cracks under your feet and you feel that sense of mass and speed as you collide with NPCs and other elements in the environment and send them flying! Being a superhero (cause face it, that's basically what you are) rarely ever felt this good :DThe combat is also a lot of fun as your various virus-related abilities make you feel increasingly powerful and badass and you can carve (literally lol!) a path of utter destruction through your enemies and the city of NY. It's a joy to experiment with your increasing array of lethal abilities and learning what works best against which enemy and being able to weaponize grenade launchers and other weaponry that you literally rip from vehicles is a blast xD8.75/10			",142,33,0,14,1,0,2

												Prototype two was a good hack n slash. The graphics were nice and the animation was fluid. The part I liked best was the open sandbox world which could be explored and I could just start mayhem at any given time. The enemy gradually becomes stronger as the game goes on and it's interesting to watch how the city deteriates through gameplay. Another cool thing is that I didn't need to play the first one to understand number 2. They even have optional recap you can watch about the previous game, but Prototype 2 has it's own story that doesn't really depend on the first. Challenge mode was fun too, I found myself spending a good hour on one challenge trying to achieve a gold award. I didn't finish this game though, perhaps I will later. I ended up losing interest after about 12 hours of gameplay because the story isn't really that in depth. You can tell they tried though, just not a lot of meat to the storyline so to speak and running around brutally murdering crowds of people gets old after awhile. Overall I give this game 6 out of 10 MF Falco's.			",75,18,0,7,10,1,23

												Definitely a major step forward from the first Prototype. The main character is actually likable this time around, gameplay is streamlined, there's a greater sense of being a superhero instead of a murderous psychopath with superpowers, and upgrading your character feels more meaningful this time around. Closest thing we'll get to inFamous on PC.			",138,36,1,35,3,3,38

												This should not be 2nd. In simple terms:Pros:1. Awsome thing you can't do in the older game. (Pack)2. It has more interesting fights.Cons:1. The main character is always trying waaaaaaaay hard to sound like a badass which simply makes you hate the story.2. They completely changed the original heros personality (a.k. Alex Mercer) which is sad. 3. Nothing to do after you finish it. (Got all the collectibles plaied around with the dlc pack which was only fun for around 10 min, and then you have nothing to do. while in Prototype 1 you could have fun with bases. So warning: If you have this game then play this first THEN play Prototype 1.As a seperate game I give this 7/10			",55,5,0,7,8,0,3

												Prototype 2 is a rather exciting game! The characters are awesome,the powers are friggin awesome! (I'm looking at you WhipFist!) everything is awesome in this game! Now,It definitely does not match up to the first game,but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get it! Now there is one problem with the game.....it has severe memory leaks. Incase you don't know what those are,memory leaks cause the game to use up more memory without expelling excess memory. Basically,it lags,FPS goes down ALOT,and it crashes. Not your typical lag,it makes the game unplayable. However,this problem is only on the PC version. If you want the game,get it for the XBox360/PS3! To sum it all up,get the game,but not for PC. It will consume hours of your day!Have fun!			",36,4,0,0,4,0,1

												Well, I played the Prototype game and loved it, is late but I got this on the date it got released and haved  been looking foward to it (shape shifting and open world moving around) since it Uber fun to play it. the thing that this series lack was better story telling and more replay value.  regardless, Prototype 2 is a great game great visuals and O-K-A-Y storyline.  since it has no online multiplayer so is sad.  They  should reboot it make it make a better storyline and more gameplay options.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prototype 2 does feel like an improved sequel, graphics are sharper, nice color effects though it still feels unoptimized like its predecessor. The story gets better, more insanity and badass. Combat system feels alot closer to something like the batman games which I thought was a better combat system compared to P1. Upgrades are received via challenges and missions instead of XP like P1. I got P1 & P2 + DLC from amazon for like $7.50 a few months ago, great deal for great games.			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

												I'm biased: I'm a sucker for fun biological designs and games that let you hunt. Sadly, the team who made Prototype 2 made it knowing that they were getting gutted, and so a lot of the neat visual stuff that they wanted to do got cut. Unlike Prototype, where you see more distinct changes from zone to zone, NYZ looks pretty much the same from zone to zone save the increased levels of destruction. Still, a fun ride worth the cost of admission.			",78,9,0,14,4,2,8

												Barely takes about 6-9 hours depending on how dedicated you are to the story line. I ♥♥♥♥ed around with the civilians and did funny♥♥♥♥♥♥for about 2 hours and did some side-content for another 2. Then ate food for 1 hour and then beat the game in 8. Not worth much more than $20. Still is a great game and definitely fun and entertaining. One of the few games that kept my attention long enough to beat it, even if the game was only 8 hours long (and insanely easy.) 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
