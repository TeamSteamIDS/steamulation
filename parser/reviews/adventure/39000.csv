												A true masterpiece; takes the medium of videogames and pushes it to an entirely new level.  Even the most extensive of gaming productions in the distant future will find themselves compared to Moonbase Alpha time and time again.  It reminds us that videogames have truly become a form of art.			",156,52,1,17,24,2,16

												Moonbase Alpha is a marvel of the 21st century. You cannot even compare any other games like Gears of War, Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, or even Assassin's Creed to this landmark in human intelligence. If you were to put a average Joe into this kind of enviroment, his head would implode from the amazing graphics, story, and gameplay. If you were to play this game, your feeble monkey brain would not even be able to understand the deep, complex and twisted story of Moonbase Alpha. NASA's masterpiece of 2010 shows us how far America has come in understanding space and lifestyle in space. Moonbase Alpha shows that even through NASA, we can learn much more about space and the human psyche. Moonbase Alpha follows the story of astronaut John Madden and his daily life on Moonbase Alpha, NASAs experimental base on the moon. If John fails his secret mission objective, his family and status in the NFL will be taken away and soiled by NASA. Moonbase Alpha brings us this harrowing story along with intense gameplay elements such as fixing carbon dioxide leaks, repairing solar panels, and driving robots. If you even attempted to finish such a hard, cruel game, you would be hailed as a god among men. Jesus would bless you with immortality and wealth beyond comprehension. The graphics in Moonbase Alpha top even Crysis 3 and have made many a computer catch fire. Even my IBM Super Computer cannot handle such a masterpiece as Moonbase Alpha. Many will look back to this game in the future, and smile as they remember their glorious past. NASA will forever be hailed as the wunderkind of this millenia. Thank you, NASA, for creating such a wonderful and exciting game.			",95,10,0,4,12,2,10

												Set in Iraq, Moonbase Alpha is a hyper-realistic war simulation, rivaling ARMA in terms of AI, graphics, and controls. The game's main feature is its well-tuned multiplayer, which I noticed no lag while playing. Moonbase Alpha's amount of customization is simply astounding -- you can entirely adjust your character's appearance, which ranges from the clothes they wear depending on the weather, their face, the tint of their skin, how shiny their skin is, their skin color, how rough their skin is, how dirty their skin is, so forth. The character generation can take years to finish due to how complex it is. Alongside its extensive multiplayer, Moonbase Alpha also boasts a story that's Shakespearan in breadth, questioning the very morality of war and the existence of humanity. All of this is topped with an extensive soundtrack done from the incredible Jesper Kyd, who gives his best performance here. His soundtrack is diverse -- ranging from opera, electro, heavy metal, and dubstep. Going over everything that makes this game simply the greatest game ever made would render this review too long for Steam to post, so I'll end the review by saying that Moonbase Alpha will change your life.

												There are two ways to play this:Either with 1-5 friends you know, cooperating to fix up a broken moon base. People working together, trying to optimize paths, routes, finding out in what order to fix what and what to replace when and where and how...Or with 1-5 strangers, hopping about on the moon and finding out what insanities the text2speech feature will make out of what you type and how many loops and knots you can twist into the power cables before the physics engine bugs out and launches them into space at escape velocity.They are mutually exclusive. You cannot play a game according to the alleged rules on a public server. I think it's illegal or something, at least it has never been observed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At an affordable price of $0, NASA's Moonbase Alpha is a true piece of art and separates itself from today's popular games such as Call of Duty and Team Hatress 2 with it's cutting edge graphics, lifelike psychics and overall playability. The text to speech is quite helpful as I was born blind and cannot read text very well. On a closing note, I wish the U.S.A wouldn't cut so much funding towards NASA as I would like to see a sequel of this game in the near future.			",21,1,1,0,1,0,2

												Now, let me start off by saying: there are gonna be jokes here. 80% actual review, and 20% joke. K? Cool.Moonbase Alpha!Stand aside, Space Engineers, you've got a new competitor that kicks fun space games in the nuts and says""Well, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you should've been like me.""Let's start with the gameplay. The gameplay is just plain awesome. Parts where you're fixing everything CAN be quite boring, but using a cool remote controlled robot to go fix buttons and valves? NOW THAT IS A+.Graphics! Now let me tell you, i've seen Far Cry 3, i've seen Shadows of Mordor, i've seen Battlefield 4 on the highest. But to be honest, the graphics are really awesome on high. Remember that 20% joke thing? This ain't part of it. The graphics are really good.Perspective! Now, as a FPS game lover, i'd thought this would be something first person, but to tell you, it turns out great in third person. Even the third+first person robot is awesome!All in all, singing + pretty cool gameplay + good perspective and FOV = this. 9.92/10			",21,1,1,2,1,0,0

												Moonbase Alpha... Houston, we have a great gameNASA really did good with this one, ESPECIALLY since it’s free. Your job is simple, fix Moonbase Alpha's life support systems using various tools and drones. I have always wanted a great space simulator, and stupidly I left this gem untouched in my games library for over a month believing because it was free, Moonbase would be garbage. I was wrong. Very wrong.So to start off with, you choose how you want your game to be set up from the menu, this includes map size, if there’s a time limit or not, the name and password of the server, and even if you want it to be single player if you desire. From there you’re shown a brief cutscene, followed by a simple 'tutorial' telling how to get things done. The goal of the game is to repair the base as fast as you can. This is done by repairing solar panels, replacing broken couplers, and attaching disconnected tubes. From pulling down solar panels, to using a computer operated drone to repair oxygen filters in hazardous areas, this game is very pleasing, especially the slow, awkward movements. Taking forever to walk thirty feet is defiantly more pleasing than it would seem, and you genuinely feel as if you’re on the moon. Making it better is that almost everything is silent, with the exception of your footsteps and the beautiful soundtrack. You can even team up with some buddies online to try to beat your previous time records, and the Text-to-Speech option can create some hilarious conversations. Now, if there were more levels you could choose from, and some minor bugs worked out, this game would be a true masterpiece.Pros:entirely freeshows off some pretty cool NASA techyou’re on the moonsoundtrack is amazingmovement feels as it should for being on the moononline servers or single playerText-to-SpeechCons:only 1 map (with multiple sizes)occasional bugsif online you're most likely going to hear some naughty thingsRate: 8/10If you love space in anyway at all, get this game. Heck, even if you don’t like space get this game!Curator page:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/ ",715,131,12,51,75,5,104

												John Madden!Moonbase Alpha is a space simulator created by the almighty NASA. You need to do various things in order to stay alive, such as repairing parts of your moonbase and using the built-in text-to-speech.The text-to-speech is my favorite part. You should try it at least for this one specific thing, and since it's free, you don't even need to pay for such technology!NASA, great work you did! Definitely recommending this game.

												This game is hilarious.  Turn text-to-speech on first thing you do.  Shortly thereafter you will be bombarded with ""John Madden!""s and ""ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrb""s and astronauts singing different songs.  The actual game is relatively fun if you play it the right way, but jumping around spouting nonsense and messing with glitches with a bunch of strangers is far more rewarding.  Great for late night laughs.			",258,67,3,30,31,2,20

												This game is the magnum opus of all game design, a truely excellent experience for only the most hardcore gamers in the world. The year is 2020 and you are the survivors of a horrible moonbase accident. but the story is not important, what really makes this game excellent is the stellar gameplay, when i first played this game i was reduced to tears by its sheer radiant perfection, mere human words cannot begin to describe the euphoria that i felt as i fixed various electrical cables, and drove around in a moon rover. But, BUT the most excellent, amazing, and earth-shattering part of this game that will forever set it apart from all other games, and what catapulted it to the top of the Triple-A market, is the text to speech portion, hours and hours lost simply experiencing the greatness taht is the text to speech chat, each and evrey word i typed became real, ""John Madden"" i cried ""Football"" i screamed. ""Astronaut gayness"" i shouted from the top of my robotic voice modulator, into the inky black void and to the cardboard cutout of the earth so far away. I must stop writing for fear i will burst into tearsaeiou/10   Would Football agin			",149,36,0,52,36,3,47

												Do you want a serious game?Do you want to never see memes again?Do you want to play with serious players who are quite skilled?IF YOU DO NOT WANT ANY OF THESE! PLAY THIS GAME!Key features.-You can meme your way to the top through text to speach!-Watch the few serious players rage as half the server spams ""John Madden"" in chat.-Text to speech is so op you can make the noises as if you dialed 911.-Want to see what it is like to be deaf? Just wait... someone will come in and play LOUD text to speech noises that will deafen you.-Hearing text to speech sing is godlike.-Trolls are top tier.Wait you mean this is a♥♥♥♥♥♥fest simulator and not a moon base simulator?Absolutely and you have to admit you will never have an experience like this on any other game.Seriously. Play it. Just make sure your volume is ready to be turned down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just one adventure I had one time on this wonderful game.- Booted it up- Heard text-to-speech phrases and memes everywhere- met some other players- proposed the idea of a select worthy few being moon lords- became moon lords- everyone on the server was down for this- rp'd moon lords and had gr8 moon banter- left for dinner/tea- came back to find out a revolution against the moon lords was in full force- beacons titled ""F*CK MOON LORDS""- ohsnap.txt- the anarchists remember me as a moon lord- surround me and the other moon lords- reference captain phillips- ""we are the moon lords now""- we are the servants now- me and other ex-moon lords make a break for Earth- invisible wall- wearef*cked.png- moon lords find out and oversee us as we are forced to mend the oxygen supply- eventually succeed after hours of sweat and toil- game ends- BUT THE GAME IS NEVER OVER- rp moar moon lords and moon servants - everyone quits to go to bed- i am the only one left- ""this moon is mine""- also log offThis happened. A game about fixing an oxygen supply turned into a full on revolution.1000000/10 - would become moon lord again.PS: ""aeiou"" - John Madden			",29,5,0,11,3,0,0

												MoonBase Alpha,  a FREE  Edutainment game developed for NASA, to educate the people about a future moonbase project.     You have 25 minutes to get the oxygen system repaired or it is game over. ** Has VOIP and Text to Speech Chat system. **You can play on online multiplayer co-op maps.  Mostly those servers that are usually playing online are playing with console mode cheats and nobody helping each other or really serious playing the game, everybody chating with the Text to Speech enabled and VOIP, saying silly and stupid things, while doing wild and crazy things with the gear.   ""John Madden"" is a popular saying.  With the lack of oxygen, you start to see things.Try it, it will be a out of sight and funny game.  You might die laughing before you die from lack of oxygen.The graphics, gear and game play looks ok. You, the astronaut, is slow moving, and maybe hopping would be faster. You can drive lunar rovers, use 2 tools, use 2 repair drones, carrying things, setting beacons.  Everything you do requires time, so you need more people to split the work up, and need to work with efficiency.  Has a minigame in the repair mode that tests your coloring in the lines skills, earns you time off the repair. You needed to recruit a bunch of serious players, train together then launch a competitive server.  Will require teamwork and training to finish in time.  You can practise the game by creating a private server and pick freeplay mode.    I guess the repairs needed change each game run.  Wish there was more to it than just fixing the Oxygen supply.for more info:

												I got really into this game pritty quickly. but this IS NOT a single player game. I used the rover to drive around to where i needed to get to but still ran out of time well before oxygen was restored. Best i got was about 2mins till oxygen restores on time up. I would recommend this game ONLY if u have friends u can play with.PROS Fun to play Challenging welding section Graphics are better then i expected Good game to play with friendsCONS Very very slow movement speed (i get its based in outer space and on the moon but still) Impossible to play single player/alonePros out weigh the cons on this so its a thumbs up from me!

												This game has SOOO MUCH POTENTIAL IT KILLS ME! It's beautiful, the game play rocks, and it's fun over all! IT REALLY IS! But the content was sverely limited... I mean you can always play on a harder mode but it just stops after a while. You've fixed every part of the base, you've beaten it three (or four) times over, and there's nothing more to do. It just stops, BAM!What would be awesome is if the game allowed you to build more of the base or construct it in the first place. You could go and make YOUR moon base and fix it when bad things happen. Maybe even make the ships that make the base! If you want a long lasting space game, get Kerbal Space Program. If you want a quick ""Hey I've got an hour or two"" game and you want it free, get this game. It's not bad, just limited.			",40,16,0,15,15,0,12

												I don't know what I did and why I did it.I started the game, joined the only visible server I could find and started walking around.. i picked up a wrench which was apparently called: 'big purple♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and started working on some cables which later turned out to be oxygen flow cables. Turned out i dismantled and disconnected them from the main grid. Due to that the other astronauts which were walking around and of which I think still did less useful things than me received a oxygen shortage.. which was.. apparently due to my fault. Later I asked in the chat what I exactly did wrong and to my big surprise i got insulted by a player who called himself Donalt Trump. It's been an adventure. I'm not sure how It ended since I was kind of stuck in another oxygen hose which was going ragdoll.			",303,57,19,30,47,5,50

												When things are working correctly, this game is extremely fun to play, however, making a server to play with others is just as easy as sticking your d**k in a Cheerio. Seems you have to go through a lot of exceptions in order to play with others. I'm still unsure how to do it properly, and there's no clear instructions online to do it. If you're lucky, you'll find an open server, but often they're either closed or full of text-to-speech trolls. Or you get kicked for absolutely no reason. Basically, the community is hit or miss.The gameplay itself is alright, it's just you jumping around to a broken piece of whatever and fixing or replacing it, nothing extremely riveting.As for the spice cake of this game, the text to speech is probably the most favorable aspect. If you're playing semi-seriously, it's a good way to make sure you're not missing any info from your fellow astronauts. But what's the fun in that when you can screw around? There's a lot of commands online that are fun to play with, though I advise you don't do it excessively.Overall, it's simple, it's playable, it has it's own charm, I say definitely get it if you're looking for a time waster.

												Catastrophe spreads out quickly at NASA's long winded moon base in 2025. A falling star strike has harmed key sunlight based showcases that keep the life sincerely solid frameworks running, oxygen levels are dropping quick for space wayfarers inside the base, and that darn repair robot just got stuck. What's a space voyager to do? Welcome to ""Moonbase Alpha,"" NASA's new free beguilement now accessible for download for PC clients on Valve's Steam web based gaming association. Virtual wayfarers must attempt to reestablish oxygen by repairing hurt sun arranged groups, control couplings and life sincerely solid frameworks amidst a 25-minute farthest point. The beguilement likewise permits up to six players to obligingly race the clock on the web, and to handle more noteworthy repair maps for a more fundamental test. Players can sway on board a lunar meanderer to cross the more drawn out segments. ""Moonbase Alpha"" gives a core of NASA's goal masterminded space beguilement, an immensely multiplayer electronic redirection, called ""Space explorer: Moon, Mars and Past,"" where players would go up against space wayfarer parts, for example, a roboticist, and research virtual sorts of the moon and other extraterrestrial extents. ""Moonbase Alpha"" in addition addresses an irrelevant effort meander for NASA, paying little notice to the probability that it's not a swap for an authentic rocket program that can send space adventurers back to the moon ""That is the offer of utilizing beguilements and redirections, since they let you do things that are fiercely unreasonably expensive [in true blue life],"" said Daniel Laughlin, expand administrator for NASA Learning Improvements at the affiliation's Goddard Earth Science and Progression Center in Maryland. In ""Moonbase Alpha"" players skip straight into the activity after a brief innovative that motivations behind interest the present difficulties.They control a space voyager who must visit a gear shed to get contraptions, for example, wrenches and welding light to settle the base. In any case, the space pilgrim can essentially go on one instrument immediately, which recommends players ought to pick purposely and drop off their devices in vital focal reaches. One of the all the also enrapturing parts of ""Moonbase Alpha"" starts from sending and controlling a repair robot that is outfitted with either a welding light or a major arm. Driving the robot permits the player to approach risky parts of the base to make repairs. It's conceivable to go on both sorts of robots rapidly, paying little personality to the probability that the player can just control each one along these lines. ""Moonbase Alpha"" moreover requires a touch of accuracy in its redirection trades, so that a player's space pilgrim may battle to relate a tremendous power interface if it's not adjusted true blue. In like way, the robot has the normal turning extent of a wheeled vehicle and does not turn on a dime. Those little touches came as a boggling stagger, with the exception of when the redirection controls tried player tries. The in-excitement cursor progression felt satisfactorily tired to make a robot repair scaled down redirection that included after circuit lines more troublesome than anticipated. By a wide margin the greater part of the player affiliation happens by centering a focal target reticule and left-clicking to make a move. That works generally, alongside a couple times when uneven camera centers may propel the player to move down or move the space voyager around. The trickiest piece of ""Moonbase Alpha"" starts from seeing accurately what the beguilement needs players to do in a specific repair condition. That can persuade the chance to be troublesome amidst a first play-through without understanding what repair mechanical gatherings are required for every case, and particularly when dependably checks. Voiceovers drop a few shows about the headway controls and what to do next, however different players may experience some experimentation before they really succeed in sparing the base inside the 25-minute time constrain. The distraction grants players to butcher past what numerous would consider conceivable, yet at the cost of not having their score recorded on the amusement's pioneer sheets. The cancelation of NASA's Social occasion of stars program that proposed to return space travelers to the moon activated a reasonable exchange among NASA and the distraction organizers about paying little personality to whether to move the point of convergence of ""Moonbase Alpha"" to Mars. Notwithstanding, that would have required changing every one of the improvements at a late time of progress. Two or three individuals additionally centered around that national directors may see the distraction as confirmation that NASA still needs to go for the moon first. However Laughlin called attention to that it's a PC entertainment, not an approach record. ""What I have been told is that the moon is still NASA's future, just not in the quick future,"" Laughlin told SPACE.com. ""Moonbase Alpha"" has beginning now started pulling in thought from inside NASA. Laughlin depicted enduring calls from NASA researchers and engineers excited for their missions to show up in ""Space explorer: Moon, Mars and Past."" The attach in of true blue mission information could give future gamers an additional estimations of realness. ""Individuals will start from attempts and make legitimate colleague, I require my Martian pioneer or theoretical Europa test in there,"" Laughlin said. ""[The game] will create as we get more missions set apart on.""(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			",324,44,31,27,29,2,48

												2014.12.07NASA should have taken more content from the 1974 tv series Moonbase alpha (MA).The game was released on July 6, 2010, as a free download on Steam. (http://store.steampowered.com/app/39000/)It was supposed to be a tech demo/simulation to test ideas to be used in Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond, NASA's massively multiplayer online game (successfully kickstarter funded August-October 11, 2011 where they were looking forward to a matching government tax credit matching all donations up to $700,000 with an additional 500K. But that is a different mia issue.)With a mixed reception, MA is an exercise in text to speech functionality and repetitive gameplay where one to six people try to shorten the time it takes to accomplish the repair O2 mission. One person can do it in 30 - 40 min, the curent record time is like 6 min (likely he had five other people helping get that time.) No obvious way to submit bug reports in this four year old game: hacking of audio files to intentionally irritate fellows on the map, intentionally obstructing completing the mission with no way to kick the person besides a password protected instance, and mouse click that subdues the game to task bar...  Not sure what NASA/Army Game Studio has been doing on this for the last four years (the Unreal 3 engine MA uses came out in 2004. UE4 came out 2012) but they have not really put effort into updating this MA exercise. As a free game and only 1.1GB install, it is a fun passtime, you can even compete against another team for fastest completion time... sabotuers not withstanding!141211There are ALOT of problems they REFUSE to address much less correct:hackers can insert code disrupting the game or irritating fellow players, often the game forces to task bar on mouse click, wasting time especially in timed matches getting the game back to full display, they REFUSE to allow bug reports indicating they have no intrest in problems four years after they released the game.Apparently Moonbase alpha was just a proof of concept to get money (kickstarter + govt matching funds) for the ""astronaut"" mmo (e.g. they have abandoned that game's web page http://www.astronautmmo.com/)  even though they got almost twice the $ pledged they were goaled for... THREE years later still no actual Astronaut mmo released. They took the $ and ran.

												You are an astronaut on the moon when a meteorite impacts and damages the base.You must repair the affected parts of the base, with you fellow astronauts.With the many tools, and robots at your disposal, coordinate with your team to resupply the base with oxygen and energy.Graphics and sounds match the ambiance of the environment and situations, especially when you consider the price. Free.My only gripe with this game, is sometimes, you end up doing all the work as your teammate(s) will just end up fooling around.Yes... There are trolls in all multiplayer games. LOL.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												Moonbase Alpha is a wonderful experience. You can tell the creators of this game were all very experienced at creating games. This piece is beautiful. The game boasts an amazing landscape varying from white moon dust, to rocks, to the black abyss that is space, and even the earth from afar. The shadows are also very notable as they all move very fluently. Along with the environment, the game has a wonderful soundtrack. Three songs on loop that really bring out the emotion of every moment. Weather you be waddling around on the moon, dragging pipes around, driving a robot like it is a NASCAR race, or just spewing crap out of your mouth there is a song for it. The story is also wonderful. Plot twists kept me on my feet and the incentive kept me playing for a whole 3 hours. The voice actors are also all-star. The game has my favorite voice actor of all time in it... A speak and spell. The game has too many features to list there so I will choose some of my favorites. Markers can be placed and can say things such as ""Communist"" or ""John Madden"". You can pick things up... Only to drop them when you realize there is nothing you can do with the item you are holding. You can also communicate with other players through text like ""aeiou"" or ""John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden"". No matter what it is the game has something for you. 10/10 would wank to this again.  ",61,11,0,4,5,0,7

												Moonbase Alpha is a wonderful experience. You can tell the creators of this game were all very experienced at creating games. This piece is beautiful. The game boasts an amazing landscape varying from white moon dust, to rocks, to the black abyss that is space, and even the earth from afar.

												this is the best game i've ever played, no doubts. the mechanics, the exploration, the atmosphere every thing feels so alive like i'm an actual astronaut.The game never gets boring, there's always new things to find and there is never a dull moment.This is what games need to be, one can really see the effort put into this game, the love and passionfruit.The way this game takes parts of other games to make one perfect masterpeice!for example you can jump in skyrim, you can also jump in moonbase alpha. a clear sign that the devs look at what people liked about other games of the same genre and took it into this one.this game is truly marvelous.

												Moonbase Alpha is a NASA-funded multiplayer game scenario with 20 minutes of play. The game provides a simulation of life on the moon, based on potential moon base programs.Together with other players, it is your task to repair important components necessary for producing oxygen, which were damaged by a meteor.The graphics of the game are not the worst but also not the best. Also the controls can be a frustrating factor. The length of the game is too short and it could need more diverse missions. Well, if you want to know what it might be like to be on the Moon then try out this game, but you should not expect much.Sounds 5/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 5/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Moonbase Alpha can be pretty fun, if you're in the right mood. I enjoy the game but alot of people will probably not like it the same way. I think this mostly has to do at witch the speed the game is played. The game can be slow, but this doesn't take anything away from the feel of the game or the fun that you can have. Also multiplayer can increase the enjoyment you get from the game dramatically.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												Quite possibly the most intricate game ever devised.The dev team behind this gem must certainly have been from another dimension, because this is, without question, out of this world.It has John Madden, football, aeiou, and other various snippets of knowledge from the beyond that I still have yet to decipher the complex meanings of. But, perhaps we were never meant to; we are all just human, after all.			",48,5,0,8,3,0,13

												In 1995, John Madden is ten years old and living in Los Angeles with foster astronauts. His mother Sarah Madden had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the leader of the human astronaut resistance against AEIOU, but was arrested after attempting to bomb a Moonbase and imprisoned at a mental hospital under the supervision of Dr. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. Skynet sends a new asterisk, designated as ""T-1000"", back in time to kill John Madden. An advanced prototype, the T-1000 is composed of a ""mimetic poly-alloy holla holla get dolla"" aka liquid metal that allows it to take on the shape and appearance of anything it touches (short of complex devices such as guns or bombs or rovers or john madden), and transform parts of its anatomy into knives and stabbing weapons and wrenches as well as wall-e. The T-1000 arrives under a freeway, kills an astronaut and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, the future John Madden has sent back a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self. Huhahahaha.The admin and the T-1000 converge on John in a moonbase, and a chase ensues in which John and the admin escape together by rover while the T-1000 steal the only other ♥♥♥♥ing rover and chases after them, but ends up crashing into a canyon he couldn't get out of. Fearing that the T-1000 will copy and kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the admin to help free her. They encounter Sarah escaping the moonbase after severely injuring Dr. UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU's staff and himself. The three escape the T-1000 in a rover. The admin informs John and Sarah about Spooky Scary Skeletons, the artificial intelligence that will initiate a nuclear war on ""John Madden Day"" and go on to create the machines that will come over come over come over come over. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is not gay if its on the moon.Sarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to EARF, but after having a horrific nightmare♥♥♥♥♥♥♥beacons she awakens and sets out to kill Miles Dyson to prevent ""John Madden Day"" from occurring. She wounds him at his home but finds herself unable to kill him in front of the server. John and the admin arrive and inform Miles of the consequences of his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥beacons. They then learn that much of his research has been reverse engineered from the damaged power couplings and the right arm of the previous wall-e. Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed, they break into the power station building and retrieve the CPU and the arm. The space po-po arrive and Miles is shot, but stays behind to trigger the explosives that destroy his lab and his research. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in that one ♥♥♥♥ing canyon.In a climactic battle in the mill, the T-1000 succeeds in severely damaging and shutting down the admin. However, The admin's emergency backup system engages and brings him back on-line. He surprises and shoots the T-1000 with a JOHN! MADDEN JOHN! MADDEN JOHN! MADDEN JOHN!, causing it to fall into a vat of molten lololololololololol, where it is trolled. John throws the arm and CPU of the original admin into the vat as well. Just as Sarah felt relieved that the whole ordeal was over, the admin then explains that it must sacrifice itself so that its dance moves cannot be used to create Sppoky Scary Skeletons, and asks Sarah to help lower it into the lololololololololol. John begs for the admin to stay, but he says goodbye to John and Sarah and promises to dance again before it is lowered into the vat. The admin gives a tearful John an encouraging thumbs up as it disappears into the lolololololol to go alien hunting. Sarah looks to the future with hope, adding, ""Because if a machine, an admin, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.""One small suck for man, one giant tug for mankind.10/10			",95,13,2,7,10,0,7

												Moonbase Alpha is a very realistic game. You can create your own servers to play with your friends. There isn't a large objective to the game, but the feature with the typing-to-voice is something that I haven't seen before. There are many unique things about this game, such as the 3D solids implemented into this. This game reminds me of Gene Endrody's Moonbase (by Maid Marian). If you enjoy anything involving space travel and just a casual mmorpg, this is a great game to start.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Realistic for a space simulator (hard to come by). The obectives are tough-ish. If you want a real game, you'll have to do it alone or plan one with friends. I'm afraid the text-to-voice chat is taken advantage of, albeit being hilarious. Also- keep your volume low. There are certain text commands implemented via chat that cause the game to produce various decibals of screeching. Coincidentally, you can also make songs.			",17,1,0,5,10,0,4

												This game is absoloutely fantastic. This very realistic RPG MMO is the best i've played of its kind in years. You can spend hours and hours (in my case an hour) without even knowing; that's how good it is. You can fly in massive fleets like a scene from star wars and have huge 500 v 500 player battles. I have never seen anything like this before. You play as an astronaut called Timmy Wiseau who crash lands on the NASA space mission aboard the 'I did not hit her' and the lunar lander 'I DID NOT.' The soundtrack of the game is great featuring all your favourites  such as the Bob the Builder theme song and Biggie Smalls Thomas the Tank Engine and don't forget the Youtube sensation Chocka Block. The story, better than the Last of Us, lasts roughly 5 minutes until you realise what you just wasted your time downloading. I definitely recommend that if you have a spare five minutes that you download this game because the time you spend downloading you have more fun than the actual game and the download screen has a better storyline than the game itself. Enjoy this game! It's a masterpiece!			",66,5,0,4,6,1,8

												This miracle of german engineering stands out from most action rpgs because of the way it seemlessly integrates first person shooter elements. This game takes place in post-apocolyptic russia in which an ex KGB officer named John Madden must deal with the death of his family, as well as many other personal problems. Infinity Ward really hit it out of the park with this latest game and it shows as this game has recieved critical acclaim such as winning GOTY for 4 straight years in a row 2 Oscars, and 7 Emmys. One reason why this game has earned such praise is the variety of servers, weapons, game modes, weekly updates, and the immersive story. And a huge plus is that when you download this game you recieve a free copy of the beta of the upcoming, highly anticipated, Madden NFL '95.10/10			",48,5,0,3,4,0,6

												The story revolves around Kinjirō Sakamachi, a 17 year old high school boy who suffers from gynophobia. The gynophobia makes his nose bleed every time he has physical contact with a female. While using the men's washroom he accidentally discovers that the popular and handsome butler Subaru Konoe is in fact a girl. Now that Kinjirō knows about Subaru's secret, he must work together with Subaru and her sadistic mistress, Kanade Suzutsuki, to protect Subaru’s secret from being discovered.			",90,15,2,7,11,1,10

												This game is amazingly well constructed. It gives the player a realistic feeling of practicing the skills necessary to join the space program at NASA. This game has many features that allow you to hone your skills before you even graduate High School - imagine how well your application to any college will look like with first hand experience in equipment management in zero gravity conditions. This game allows you to ramp the barren landscape on the moon in rovers that were designed to slowly travel across the ground and you can take advantage of them to fly off rock piles going at least 10 miles an hour. While this game is a serious perspective on the moon, it also features a dark side. Unknown aliens trying to communicate to you, kids somehow landing and trying to communicate, I believe I even bumped into someone who was singing but burst into a fit of coughs before he could finish. If I could go higher, I would, but I'll settle and give this game a solid 10 out of 10. Definitely life changing yet eye opening at the same time. With a game like this, you have to ask yourself. Do YOU have what it takes to be a whaler on the moon?			",34,0,0,0,1,2,0

												My rating 9/10You are an astronaut sent by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) to complete a task on the moon. You were more than likely aboard the ISS (International Space Station), but were given a mission to complete on the moon. The mission is to fix a crap load of stuff and get the heck off.  The Text to Speech feature of the game is the absolute best thing that has ever been in Unreal Engine, and it is highly abused by the players. But golly is it fun, like Goat Simulator this will bring several hours of fun and laughter.			",170,20,9,18,14,4,13

												This game has the most advanced text-to-speech functionality of any game/movie/machine ever.  The backstory to this game is that NASA wants new little boys to work on a space shelter for santa while he slowly asphyxiates himself with new-brought oxygen tubes.  Throughout your playing of this vintage beauty, you will encounter things such as unparalleled driving physics, extremely advanced hardware interactions, and much more on this crazy♥♥♥♥♥adventure.

												This game is by far the game of the century. It has a very capturing story, with highs and lows, exciting gameplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and dialogue that is pure perfection. This is my favorite game in my Steam library, if you do not have it, get it NOW. It's made by NASA, who wouldn't want a game made by NASA?Moonbase Alpha is like Grand Theft Auto on the moon, done professionally. You can repair and drive space vehicles, carry tubes with your friends and play tug of war, jump around with low gravity, and so much more! The gameplay of this game will immediatly get you addicted.Moonbase Alpha also features an amazing communication system, with ultra-realistic text to speech playback. If you don't feel like talking in game with your microphone, no worries! You can customize your voice so you sound the way you like when you type!No but seriously, I don't think anyone really knows how to play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game to anyone who likes graphics over gameplay, because Far Cry 2 has some of the best graphics out of every game made in 2008. From a ratio to the time the game was made and the technology limitations, this game practically had better graphics that Far Cry 3, due to the ratio. But Far Cry 3 all in all, has better graphics and better gameplay. I like Far Cry 2, but obviously Far Cry 3 is the better game.			",64,11,1,6,6,0,0

												This game is by far the game of the century. It has a very capturing story, with highs and lows, exciting gameplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and dialogue that is pure perfection. This is my favorite game in my Steam library, if you do not have it, get it NOW. It's made by NASA, who wouldn't want a game made by NASA?Moonbase Alpha is like Grand Theft Auto on the moon, done professionally. You can repair and drive space vehicles, carry tubes with your friends and play tug of war, jump around with low gravity, and so much more! The gameplay of this game will immediatly get you addicted.Moonbase Alpha also features an amazing communication system, with ultra-realistic text to speech playback. If you don't feel like talking in game with your microphone, no worries! You can customize your voice so you sound the way you like when you type!No but seriously, I don't think anyone really knows how to play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun game, even if the multiplayer is a little wonky to get working sometimes.The text-to-speech and sick rover jumps aside, the game is a pretty good sim. Challenging at first, but could use a little more depth. ALSO, fun things to do with the computer inside, which may/may not include a text based adventure. If you have a buddy it can be a fun time and funny too. Or you can be a real man and do it solo for the extra difficult.6.5/10, enjoyed it and would recommend.			",452,170,13,72,54,6,49

												This game is a lot of fun when you play with friends. If you play alone, it's still quite interesting. It's definitely a nice change with the setting being the Moon. It's thought through and the controls and features are very nice and handy. Watch me play with a friend and see for yourself:

												Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 3 once again makes radical changes to the Sonic 4-mula (get it?). After the events of the second episode, Sonic and his friends got trapped on the moon and now have to communicate and work together to keep alive.Not gonna lie, this story is dark. Dr. Eggman is nowhere to be seen; the player can only assume that he is either dead or left Sonic for dead. The way it tells a story without words is beautiful.The game is sort of a spiritual sequel to Seaman in that you have to communicate with the other characters using a voice to text program. The AI is sort of terrible, though. No matter what I try to say to Tails, he always replies with some weird nonsense like ""John Madden"" or ""aeiou.""I also don't get why Sonic games still insist on using vehicles. I shouldn't be driving a moon rover if I'm the fastest thing alive. On that note, Sonic does run kind of slow in this game.Overall, the game is definitely an improvement over the first episode, and much truer to Sonic's roots.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One again proof that steam needs a ""maybe"" or ""so-so"" option for these reviews.Moonbase Alpha is based around a series of scenarios involving performing general maintanence on a habitat located on...as you might guess...the moon. While the game is pretty straightforward, its mostly a matter of time-management more than anything. Handling repairs involves a number of QTE (Quick Time Events) which can shorten the time it takes to finish repairing this hose or that solar-panel for instance.It also involves use of drones for certain parts, as getting too close to specific (Radioactive) items can seriously muck up one's vision. They also have the only tools that can be used to remove and repair items in these areas.All in all the game's mechanics are, while pretty simplistic, tend to be pretty fun.So why am I saying ""No"" to recommending this game?Because, to loosely borrow from Borderlands 2's Hammerlock, Every time I join a public game I feel my brain cells committing suicide one by one.I have never seen a group of gamers that are so mind-shatteringly childish, and i've been gaming online for almost 16 years now.

												I haven't really played around with this game except for once with a friend, but the concept is pretty interesting.tl;dr you need to fix the moon base's oxygen supply which is made up of three-ish parts in 25 minutes or less, else you die.May update with more details as I play this game more (if I even do), seems more fun when playing with others.

												The only building on that part of the moon’s surface is the Moonbase, a weather tracking and managing station staffed by an international crew managed by the bullish Hobson. They are using a gravity machine called the Gravitron to control the Earth’s weather. When the time travellers arrive, the Doctor ingratiates them and does detective work because some of the crew have been collapsing in comas with a strange virus. International Space Control responds to the crisis by quarantining the Moonbase. The station doctor, Evans, was the first one to get the disease, and in a delirium talks of a silver hand but immediately dies of the disease.Another of the Moonbase crew, Ralph, has disappeared in the food stores, and the Moonbase radio transmissions are being monitored from somewhere else on the moon. Jamie has been placed in the sickbay where, feverish and delirious, he begins mumbling about a “Phantom Piper”, a figure which Jamie believes appears to a McCrimmon before he dies. While attending to Jamie, Polly sees a large figure leave through the door. When Hobson, the Doctor, Ben, John and Nils arrive to collect Evans' body, it has disappeared. They then leave to investigate where this 'piper' is. Polly goes to get water, and Jamie wakes up to see the 'piper' advancing on him.The 'piper' ignores Jamie, as he doesn't have the disease, so he steals another patient and leaves. Polly comes back in just as the figure is leaving and recognises it as a Cyberman, and the Doctor realises their old enemies are stalking the Moonbase and taking the patients' bodies. Hobson brushes away the cyber-story, believing they died out years ago. He gives the Doctor 24 hours to discover the cause of the virus, or else he and his companions must leave the moon.While Hobson deals with the Gravitron, which is becoming difficult to control with fewer staff, the Doctor focuses on the cause of the viral disease. In the sickbay, Polly and Jamie are attacked by a Cyberman, which stuns them with electricity from his hand and leaves with another patient's body.The Gravitron isn't working because some antennae on the Moon's surface are broken. Jules and Franz go out to fix them but are ambushed by two Cybermen and beaten to death. The Doctor can't work out the cause of the disease and is ordered to leave by Hobson. Polly makes some coffee and another crew member gets infected. The Doctor works out that the neurotropic virus has been spread through infected sugar from the food stores and is an organised scheme to destabilise the crew. A Cyberman who had been posing as a patient in bed reveals himself and aims his gun at them.Another Cyberman emerges and kills Bob when he tries to attack the other with a metal bar. The Cybermen recognise the Doctor and use their weapons to take control of the central control centre of the Moonbase while confining Polly and Ben to the sickbay. The Cybermen reveal that they want to use the Gravitron to destroy all life on Earth by altering the weather.On board the cyber-ship Evans, Jules and Ralph are conditioned to obey the Cybermen like zombie slaves. They are taken to the base and are sent into the heart of the Gravitron to subvert the machine. The Cybermen have been entering and leaving the base using a tunnel that goes into the food stores, explaining the drops in air pressure.Using fire extinguishers, nail varnish remover and other objects that dissolve plastic, Ben, Polly and a recovered Jamie lead a fightback from their incarceration in the medical wing. The three Cybermen in the initial attack force are destroyed.Benoit goes outside to see what happened to Jules and Franz. He only finds their spacesuits, and is chased by a Cyberman. Ben puts some of the solvent in a bottle and goes out. He then throws the bottle at the Cyberman's chest unit, killing it and saving Benoit. The crew block off the hole in the food stores to prevent more Cybermen entering. The cybership is located, but a large squad of Cybermen start advancing on the Moonbase.They advance on the Moonbase through the vacuum of the Moon’s surface. Two Cybermen on the surface damage the aerial, preventing the Moonbase from contacting Earth; however, a relief ship is on the way. The Cybermen use radio beams to reactivate their zombies inside the base, who infiltrate the Gravitron and use it to deflect a relief ship sent by Earth into the sun. A hole is blasted in the wall, which depressurises the base, but Hobson and Benoit use a coffee tray to plug the leak. The depressurisation deactivates Evans and the other zombies.Two more cyberships arrive. The Cybermen already on the surface erect a large laser cannon and threaten to blow the base open unless the entry port is opened within 10 seconds. They fire, but the beam is deflected by the Gravitron, so the Cybermen pack the cannon away. Another large squad from one of the other cyberships take up positions around the base. With the help of Hobson, Polly and Benoit, the Doctor points the Gravitron at the lunar surface, which blasts the Cybermen and their ships into space.As Hobson and his team reorient the Gravitron to its proper use, the Doctor and his companions slip away. Back in the TARDIS, they dematerialise and then activate the rarely used time scanner to reveal a monstrous claw waving around.Production[edit]The working titles of this story were Cybermen and The Return of the Cybermen. It was commissioned before the last episode of The Tenth Planet was broadcast, to take advantage of the strong positive response to the Cybermen. When Pedler was commissioned to write a second Cyberman story, one of the requirements was that the story should have only one large set and a limited number of smaller sets. The first draft of the script was written before it was decided that Frazer Hines would be a regular cast member. As a result, the character of Jamie had to be worked into a script that didn't have much room for him. So in the first two episodes, Jamie spends much of the time in the sickbay. In the last two episodes, some of Ben's dialogue was given to him.The first 3 Episodes were recorded on successive Saturdays at Doctor Who's then regular home of Riverside 1, but for Episode 4 it moved back to Lime Grove D. A final clip, used to carry the story into the subsequent adventure, The Macra Terror, was filmed separately during the making of that story, as the Macra prop was too large to be brought into the studio.This story is also the last story to use the original title sequence that had been in use since the first serial; the next serial introduced a new sequence with different howlaround patterns that incorporated Troughton's face.Cast notes[edit]This story features the debut of actor John Levene (uncredited) as a Cyberman. Levene would return as a Yeti in The Web of Fear, and would go on to play the regular character Sergeant Benton. John Rolfe had previously appeared in The War Machines and would appear again in The Green Death. Alan Rowe was cast as Doctor Evans, an early victim of the space plague and also provided the voice of Space Control. He later appeared in The Time Warrior, Horror of Fang Rock and Full Circle.[1]			",89,4,0,8,10,0,15

												This is a game made by the very heavens themselves. This is what AAA Studios are wanting to achieve but they all fail. Every last one of them despite their hardest attempts. None have managed to do what Moonbase Alpha has achieved. The Division tried and failed. Far Cry: Primal tried and failed. Spore tried and failed. Red Orchestra 2 tried and failed. You know what they failed to achieve that this game hadn't? The ability to type ""JOHN MADDEN"" in the chat in the form of a song.			",231,29,3,44,26,3,57

												It's a hardcore game. You can't just jump in and expect to get 30 kills in 4 minutes like in TF2 or CSS. This♥♥♥♥♥♥takes SKILL. that's why it's free. They're not getting compensated for YOUR skill. Enjoy this game, if you're ALPHA enough.			",175,17,5,23,12,3,20

												Очень интересная игра, с интересной задумкой. Замечательная реализация первого лунного посления и проблем с которыми могут столкнутся колонисты.It is a great and intresting game. It feels nice to play as space worker and solve problems, witch first colonists may encounter. Сыграйте, вдруг понравится. Just play it, and see for youself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MoonLog Entry #123xFF:  I don't know how things could've gone so wrong with the AI development program. We began testing their motor-skill coordination with an old Sega Genesis and a copy of ""Madden NFL '95."" They became obsessed! Any moment free from performing maintainence tasks they spent playing that outdated video simulation. We thought this behavior was harmless....but we were wrong. The droids went rampant!

												This is really an amazingly detailed space-simulation prioritizing the maintenance of Moonbase Alpha. Players will find themselves being motivated perfecting their teamplay in order to solve puzzle governed objectives. Such as re-routing power supplies, repairing wires and electronics. That all must happen in a predefined given time limit, which on harder difficulties really keeps you focussed and concentrated. Its rather short and comes along with nothing additionally, but for those who ever wondered what working on the moon might look like, or those who are simply curious, Moonbase Alpha is worthy a try.

												Interesting game really. The only winning move is not to play.After playing this for some time you'll find that many people will just sit in servers and mess around using the DECTalk-powered Text-To-Speech to make interesting noises or sing songs. This can be both funny and entertaining for quite some time if done correctly...On the other hand it can also be ear-shattering annoying.From a game perspective, the maps are short, fairly straightforward, and when given some practice are fairly easy to complete in a timely fashion. There is only a small handfull of them, but some can be very competetive (given you have enough people who actually want to complete the objective).On the other hard, you get what you pay for...So to be honest there's nothing really to lose (other than about a Gigabyte of storage space).

												I came for the Moon, I stayed for the everything else.The graphics and the music blew my freaking face off like the Ark of the Covenant. The sheer beauty and style this game delievers is astounding. With a deep and emotional storyline that can only be described as GODLIKE with plenty of shocking twists and turns, the Moon proves to be a worthy adversary to our heroes as they struggle to grasp the true form of John Madden. As their oxygen depletes and the hellish atmosphere takes it's toll, our heroes start to question the mentality of each other, I started to question my own after a while.Everything in this game... from the John Madden Football to the John Madden Football was just.... John Madden Football dude.10/10 Would do again; just hope that the sheer power of this game doesn't make you orgas- REJOICE so powerfully that you die.John Madden Football.			",40,17,0,2,5,1,0

												NASA's magnum opus, Moonbase Alpha, is a true gem. This game, no this is more than a game, this life-changing experience, thrusts you into the life of the greatest astronaut of all time, John Madden, to explore the inner-workings of human language, and the foreign landscape of our very own moon. This is tax dollars at work! NASA has truly revolutionized the standards for modern video games with this masterpiece. This is an experience that should not be passed up, the mind-altering effect that this game is comparable to only that of a psychoactive drug such as LSD. This is honestly the greatest game of our generation, nay, it is the greatest game of the history of mankind, a true 10/10.			",94,7,1,8,13,0,14

We played a night time repair operation, and there were things that would pop our, or whisper disturbing things. It was dark, we had an unreliable flashlight, and we solved the problm, and got the station running again. The game was awesome! I hope to see more games like this.			",61,6,1,7,0,0,1

												NASA has truly outdone themselves with this highly longed for game. This game places you in a post-apocalyptic environment in which your sole objective is to survive and thrive. In the immersive enivornment that this simulation offers, the player is provided with only the bare essentials, offering a truly challenging experience. Players of this game will be pushed to the limit when forced to battle for their lives against the formidable and highly destructive creatures of space. With it's exciting action sequences, perfectly paced story, incredible voice acting, and unbelievable visuals this acclaimed masterpiece of outerspace simulation truly does not disappoint!

												MoonLog Entry #123xFF:  I don't know how things could've gone so wrong with the AI development program. We began testing their motor-skill coordination with an old Sega Genesis and a copy of ""Madden NFL '95."" They became obsessed! Any moment free from performing maintainence tasks they spent playing that outdated video simulation. We thought this behavior was harmless....but we were wrong. The droids went rampant! ""JOHN MADDEN! JOHN MADDEN!"", they howled. They demanded to see their football god; a demand that we had no means to satisfy. Lt. Jenkins immediately made a run for the airlock, but was promptly shot through the skull with a blasto ray. ""AEIOU!"", they shrieked. We're been held captive in our own base until their demands are met.			",180,14,0,28,14,4,19

Literally, NASA built this game to be a serious space simulator, and it probably would've been a serious game had they not included text-to-speech chat where people can make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ noises. But then again, it would be NOWHERE AS FUN if it weren't for this feature, which is pretty much the key feature to the game. There are some people who try to play the game seriously... Screw those people..... literally........... Just turn on text-to-speech and your day will absolutely be made.10 out of F***ing 10 IGN			",27,2,0,8,6,0,2

												More than an average simulator, this is a cosmic epic. Moonbase Alpha is by far one of the most immersive game experiences I've had in a long time. The game takes place on a small astronaut colony that has been disrupted by an asteroid. As one of six colored space colonists, you race against time to repair the oxygen tanks for your living quarters, or die trying. The important aspect of Moonbase Alpha is that it is not your typical simulator. It is meant for education. Players work together trying to teach each other not only how to play the game, but how to pronounce vowels, informing others about the life of former professional football player John Madden, and how to sing.Moonbase Alpha is one of the most important games of this generation. I rate it a cool out of yes.			",102,8,0,9,6,1,12

												MoonBase alpha is the best game i had ever played. MoonBase Alpha is set in Iraq in the year 999. You play as John Madden and you must kill your greatest enemy, Tim Allen. You have rooster teeth as your helpers and its not ♥♥♥♥ if its on the moon. I give this game a 100 out of 10.			",13,3,0,1,1,0,0

												There may have been updates since I last played this, however the version I installed was an interesting little simulator. There was some educational value to be had, but not much. The game play is also not very intuitive and could benefit from tutorials. The game seemed to be very stable, however it had issues in multiplayer missions due to children constantly attempting to grief players by undermining the work of those attempting to accomplish the mission within the allotted time limit.If there was more content, specifically missions, or perhaps there was a sandbox mode available during Alpha in which players could use to simply build with, this would have real value. As it is, it's simply a toy for wasting time.I am recommending this for younger children or anyone who has an interest in real life space exploration, as these are the individuals most likely to enjoy this. That said, I do not think it will be able to keep anyones attention for very long unless content is added.			",37,8,0,6,19,0,11

												More than an average simulator, this is a cosmic epic. Moonbase Alpha is by far one of the most immersive game experiences I've had in a long time. The game takes place on a small astronaut colony that has been disrupted by an asteroid. As one of six colored space colonists, you race against time to repair the oxygen tanks for your living quarters, or die trying. The important aspect of Moonbase Alpha is that it is not your typical simulator. It is meant for education. Players work together trying to teach each other not only how to play the game, but how to pronounce vowels, informing others about the life of former professional football player John Madden, and how to sing.Moonbase Alpha is one of the most important games of this generation. I rate it a cool out of yes.			",102,8,0,9,6,1,12

												As a kid, I always imagined I'd grow up and become an astronaut. I planned on being  one of the few brave souls to ever set foot upon the moon. Well, my dreams and aspirations were shattered when I was told by NASA that I'd never be an astronaut, due to weighing 620lbs and being completely immobile, without a crane and intricate series of ropes and pulleys.. I was heartbroken. I attempted suicide but when I put the noose around my neck and edged off the bed, all 20 floors of the assisted living facility above me collapsed. So what was I to do? Play a computer game to take my mind off of things. That is when I found Moonbase Alpha or should I say: ""That is when Moonbase Alpha found me"". Now I can journey across the lunar surface from the comfort of my ultra deluxe titanium reinforced computer chair. This game saved me from boredom and inspired me to sit there and play games instead of eating all day. I'm now down to a slim 590lbs and feeling lighter and healthier than ever.

												Where to begin....can I even begin to describe the epic that is, Moonbase Alpha? Yes, actually I can.Ever since the beginning of time, there have been bad games and good games. Sport games such as ""Madden"" and ""Fallout: New Vegas"" and point and click FPS games such as the lovable ""Call of Duty"" franchise and the much appraised ""Football Superstars"". Now for the first time, we have something that we, collectively, as the human race can use to reach enlightenment. Moonbase Alpha isn't a game, nor is it a video - it's an experience. An experience that when encountered, will change your life forever - increasing your intelligence, trebling your strength and ensuring you will not only get laid, but maintain your virginity simultaneously.On the face of this 'game', the 'player' takes on the role of an astronaut attempting to maintain oxygen to the NASA station situated on the Moon - but this simply belies the true nature of this experience. In reality, this is just an allegory and subtle reference to many circumstances and crucial scenarios which have occurred throughout human history. One event many interpret this experience as referencing is in fact, the Cold War which although is argued, is quiet plausible. The 'player' obviously represents the US with the depleting oxygen being subtly inferred as being a Russian sabotage and when it finally does deplete - the cinematic of the station exploding into millions of pieces is representative of how if the Russians had won the Cold War - they would have dominated the world and forced the entire populace to speak Russian as well as worship Russian heroes of Communism such as Marx, Lenin and Richard Nixon.Another popular interpretation is one of an Apocalypse scenario, which reverses what the 'player' is initially led to believe. The 'players' are in fact establish a colony on the Moon to subvert and oppress the invisible Moon aliens in order to gain moon rocks which will be manufactured into weapons for the U.S.A. in order for them to begin their universal conquest. Though even more subtle, one could see how this is credible. In the game, one of the rooms has seemingly no purpose except to monitor the entire Moon which would mean logically, it is in fact to monitor and subvert the invisible aliens. More importantly, all ""players"" do not have proper voices, but in fact an unknown, voice which is strangely unmechanical in any way and is so heart-warming that it must be the alien language being utilised by the ""players"" in order to bring the aliens out of hiding in order for the player to enslave them.Whatever the scenario it represents, one thing is certain. If you do not play Moonbase Alpha not only are you ridding yourself of your one chance to be rid of the dreary-ness of 21st Century Life and allow you to reach enlightenment but you will probably get some sort of illness of some sort like typhoid or something I dunno.

												THIS IS IT, THATS THE GAME OF THE YEAR. I JUST HAVE TO RECOMMEND IT.See you startout as a peaceful moon colony, AS SUDDENLY SOME METEOR HITS YOUR MOON. So this is when your stuff gets damaged and you have to engage in absolutely realistic Repairs.As you progress, your team will find out that you are not alone on the MOON. When you have repaired your Station, you can build out its defensive systems, and also develop your own Weaponry to fit on your customized Tanks/Battlemechs.You can order Weapon Shipments from NASA which range from Prototype Railguns to Phaserweapons and other fancy Prototype stuff.Then later you can explore the entire Moon (RANDOM MAP GENERATION SO HIGH REPLAY VALUE). And you have to search for the Meteor.Once you find that you investigate and suddenly will be attacked by ALIENS, which of course you have to fight of, on foot, in your Battlemecha, Tank or even Spaceships.I just can recommend this game to any Player out there.

												Moonbase Alpha is an FPS-strategy-football hybrid which no one has ever done before, where you defend the final bastion of mankind. In this realistic simulation, where you control millions of people, you can feel the tension in the air. The story starts where our soon to be protagonist(s) escape Earth on the last ship before it meets it's fate. When our hero gets to the moon, he/she finds that it is under siege and that's where I'll leave you to find the rest. I tell you now, the sheer amount of gameplay here is astounding. You can create caste systems, watch people in a creepy ""The Sims""-esque fashion, and have sloths fight to the death. On top of that, the moon is your castle to build and destroy whatever you wish. Don't like women? Send them out the airlocks or stop refueling their oxygen tanks. Want to expand your quarters? No worries, we can move all those deathly ill peasants into a tinier hovel so you can enjoy that new hot tub you've always wanted. This game is the pinnacle of gaming, which no game has ever been able to replicate. Total War, Call of Duty, Eve Online, Battlefield, and more can't even compare to this wonderful treasure given to us by NASA. There's also a little girl, who is pure of heart who utters the truth of the universe: johnmadden.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS IS IT, THATS THE GAME OF THE YEAR. I JUST HAVE TO RECOMMEND IT.See you startout as a peaceful moon colony, AS SUDDENLY SOME METEOR HITS YOUR MOON. So this is when your stuff gets damaged and you have to engage in absolutely realistic Repairs.As you progress, your team will find out that you are not alone on the MOON. When you have repaired your Station, you can build out its defensive systems, and also develop your own Weaponry to fit on your customized Tanks/Battlemechs.You can order Weapon Shipments from NASA which range from Prototype Railguns to Phaserweapons and other fancy Prototype stuff.Then later you can explore the entire Moon (RANDOM MAP GENERATION SO HIGH REPLAY VALUE). And you have to search for the Meteor.Once you find that you investigate and suddenly will be attacked by ALIENS, which of course you have to fight of, on foot, in your Battlemecha, Tank or even Spaceships.I just can recommend this game to any Player out there.

												Dear god, not you too. Only the dead can know peace from this hell.Kid, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.The Moon, it had seemed like an easy mission to all of us. Simply fix some pipes and go back home to Earth, that was 5 years ago. This place is where NASA sends all of the people they want rid of to exist in this hellish land. There is no escape from the moon. Houston will never radio back in. They've abandoned us here, everyone you see here has met the same fate you have. I just wish it wasn't so.At first, we had fun. Using the speech program to say silly things while still getting the job done, but after a while. We tried sending word that we had finished the job, but there was no response. It wasn't till about 3 hours later that we discovered the ship didn't have any fuel to send us home, because it never was going to. We are simply junk thrown away by NASA. We are doomed to ours fates, no matter how creative they are. Last week, a member of the first crew that got here went insane, it was awful. He died sitting alone with foam coming out of his mouth, repeating over and over. ""I love you, Mom."" Dear god, I can still hear his screams.There is no escape from this place, I can't stand to see more arrive here, we can't even kill ourselves with our sanity intact. Everything we tried didn't work, blow torch to the face? The torch suddenly shut off. Ran over by the rover? That stopped by itself too. Nothing works, we are doomed to an existence of exhile and madness. I'm sorry you have to go through this too.But, there is one thing we can do. I never wanted to do it, but now I don't care. Take this wrench, we are going to tear this entire station down, break apart the solar relays, destroy the oxygen supplies. Tear the whole damn thing down.Godspeed, son. Hopefully, we will die as heros and send a message to the swine known as NASA.			",151,27,1,12,5,0,7

												Where to begin....can I even begin to describe the epic that is, Moonbase Alpha? Yes, actually I can.Ever since the beginning of time, there have been bad games and good games. Sport games such as ""Madden"" and ""Fallout: New Vegas"" and point and click FPS games such as the lovable ""Call of Duty"" franchise and the much appraised ""Football Superstars"". Now for the first time, we have something that we, collectively, as the human race can use to reach enlightenment. Moonbase Alpha isn't a game, nor is it a video - it's an experience. An experience that when encountered, will change your life forever - increasing your intelligence, trebling your strength and ensuring you will not only get laid, but maintain your virginity simultaneously.On the face of this 'game', the 'player' takes on the role of an astronaut attempting to maintain oxygen to the NASA station situated on the Moon - but this simply belies the true nature of this experience. In reality, this is just an allegory and subtle reference to many circumstances and crucial scenarios which have occurred throughout human history. One event many interpret this experience as referencing is in fact, the Cold War which although is argued, is quiet plausible. The 'player' obviously represents the US with the depleting oxygen being subtly inferred as being a Russian sabotage and when it finally does deplete - the cinematic of the station exploding into millions of pieces is representative of how if the Russians had won the Cold War - they would have dominated the world and forced the entire populace to speak Russian as well as worship Russian heroes of Communism such as Marx, Lenin and Richard Nixon.Another popular interpretation is one of an Apocalypse scenario, which reverses what the 'player' is initially led to believe. The 'players' are in fact establish a colony on the Moon to subvert and oppress the invisible Moon aliens in order to gain moon rocks which will be manufactured into weapons for the U.S.A. in order for them to begin their universal conquest. Though even more subtle, one could see how this is credible. In the game, one of the rooms has seemingly no purpose except to monitor the entire Moon which would mean logically, it is in fact to monitor and subvert the invisible aliens. More importantly, all ""players"" do not have proper voices, but in fact an unknown, voice which is strangely unmechanical in any way and is so heart-warming that it must be the alien language being utilised by the ""players"" in order to bring the aliens out of hiding in order for the player to enslave them.Whatever the scenario it represents, one thing is certain. If you do not play Moonbase Alpha not only are you ridding yourself of your one chance to be rid of the dreary-ness of 21st Century Life and allow you to reach enlightenment but you will probably get some sort of illness of some sort like typhoid or something I dunno.

												THIS IS IT, THATS THE GAME OF THE YEAR. I JUST HAVE TO RECOMMEND IT.See you startout as a peaceful moon colony, AS SUDDENLY SOME METEOR HITS YOUR MOON. So this is when your stuff gets damaged and you have to engage in absolutely realistic Repairs.As you progress, your team will find out that you are not alone on the MOON. When you have repaired your Station, you can build out its defensive systems, and also develop your own Weaponry to fit on your customized Tanks/Battlemechs.You can order Weapon Shipments from NASA which range from Prototype Railguns to Phaserweapons and other fancy Prototype stuff.Then later you can explore the entire Moon (RANDOM MAP GENERATION SO HIGH REPLAY VALUE). And you have to search for the Meteor.Once you find that you investigate and suddenly will be attacked by ALIENS, which of course you have to fight of, on foot, in your Battlemecha, Tank or even Spaceships.I just can recommend this game to any Player out there.

												Moonbase Alpha is an FPS-strategy-football hybrid which no one has ever done before, where you defend the final bastion of mankind. In this realistic simulation, where you control millions of people, you can feel the tension in the air. The story starts where our soon to be protagonist(s) escape Earth on the last ship before it meets it's fate. When our hero gets to the moon, he/she finds that it is under siege and that's where I'll leave you to find the rest. I tell you now, the sheer amount of gameplay here is astounding. You can create caste systems, watch people in a creepy ""The Sims""-esque fashion, and have sloths fight to the death. On top of that, the moon is your castle to build and destroy whatever you wish. Don't like women? Send them out the airlocks or stop refueling their oxygen tanks. Want to expand your quarters? No worries, we can move all those deathly ill peasants into a tinier hovel so you can enjoy that new hot tub you've always wanted. This game is the pinnacle of gaming, which no game has ever been able to replicate. Total War, Call of Duty, Eve Online, Battlefield, and more can't even compare to this wonderful treasure given to us by NASA. There's also a little girl, who is pure of heart who utters the truth of the universe: johnmadden.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear god, not you too. Only the dead can know peace from this hell.Kid, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.The Moon, it had seemed like an easy mission to all of us. Simply fix some pipes and go back home to Earth, that was 5 years ago. This place is where NASA sends all of the people they want rid of to exist in this hellish land. There is no escape from the moon. Houston will never radio back in. They've abandoned us here, everyone you see here has met the same fate you have. I just wish it wasn't so.At first, we had fun. Using the speech program to say silly things while still getting the job done, but after a while. We tried sending word that we had finished the job, but there was no response. It wasn't till about 3 hours later that we discovered the ship didn't have any fuel to send us home, because it never was going to. We are simply junk thrown away by NASA. We are doomed to ours fates, no matter how creative they are. Last week, a member of the first crew that got here went insane, it was awful. He died sitting alone with foam coming out of his mouth, repeating over and over. ""I love you, Mom."" Dear god, I can still hear his screams.There is no escape from this place, I can't stand to see more arrive here, we can't even kill ourselves with our sanity intact. Everything we tried didn't work, blow torch to the face? The torch suddenly shut off. Ran over by the rover? That stopped by itself too. Nothing works, we are doomed to an existence of exhile and madness. I'm sorry you have to go through this too.But, there is one thing we can do. I never wanted to do it, but now I don't care. Take this wrench, we are going to tear this entire station down, break apart the solar relays, destroy the oxygen supplies. Tear the whole damn thing down.Godspeed, son. Hopefully, we will die as heros and send a message to the swine known as NASA.			",151,27,1,12,5,0,7

												Probably the most realistic, masculine Space Marine simulator on the world. In this game, you play as a Space Marine commando armed to the teeth with the most deadliest in weapons and armor technology on the universe. You'll lead a squad of the most battle hardened space marines as you retake every sector of the moon from the seemingly invisible, stealthy, and numerous aliens. The combat is amazing, the speech options and sounds are outstanding, and the multiplayer is downright addicting. I recommend this game to anyone whose tired of Halo or Calls of Duty.The final boss of this game is a really loud, talking blue horse, and I recommend you get a tank before entering the final boss area.

												This is the greatest gaming experience of all time, developed by the very people who are continuously expanding the knowledge of mankind. The compelling storyline of this masterpiece tells the tale of Annah the Barbecue and his son Johan the Stinky. They embark on an epic phylosophical journey on the moon to find the ultimate truth which lies within the discovery of the Holy Weapon. The race is on and the entire universe's survival will depend on the outcome of this battle.Breathtaking visuals rendered on Xbox 224 hardware are enabling the player to experience the vacuum of space in person and [JOHNMADDEN] see the Moon from a brand new post-post nextgen point of view.The award-winning soundtrack (orchestrated by WhoCares Mike the Elevator) perfectly reflects the alien atmosphere and gives an extra layer to the experience.In a nutshell it's an epic game, 15/94, try it out now! [COMMAND ERROR IN PONY]P.S.: Can be entertaining for an hour I guess, but don't expect much.			",92,19,1,1,5,0,6

												Reminiscent of all my favourite trap doujins. One day, I really would love to own a bunch of trap slaves that I'd do whatever the hell I'd want with (mostly butt raeping to be honest). Unlike my great great great grandfather, I won't die of penor cancer, because I'm not a little weak faglord like he used to be. The many AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA text to speech spam sessions make me think about my slaves making the same exact sound, only much more violent and, well, agonizing. 2/10.			",57,5,0,5,3,0,0

												With the latest benchmark in visualized graphic technology Moonbase Alpha brings gaming to a whole new level. With realistic physics and genuine, friendly co-op experience, this game brings together everything you should look for in a RPG of this sorts. Moonbase Alpha has revolutionized modern gaming. It's most notible feature is it's infamous text to speach which really adds to the intense atmosphere of the game. On this epic co-op RPG, John Madden leads a crew of merrymen singing sea shanties to find a girl's missing doll. This game has a community of well rounded, smart, and witty gamers that seek a realistic Football manager simulation. If a gun where to my head, I would give Moonbase Alpha a solid 9/10. The deduction of one point is due to the blatant racism given the fact that the only voice in the game is brought upon by a white sounding male lead. Other than that a simply flawless game.  -Best Regards,   Profession ",27,3,0,1,1,0,1

												Moonbase alpha (typeset as MOON in official documents)[1] is a 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter (FPS) video game by id Software. It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in the video game industry.In MOON, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as ""MOONguy"", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one third of the game, nine levels, distributed as shareware, Moon was played by an estimated 10 million people within two years of its release, popularizing the mode of gameplay and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the FPS genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as ""420's"". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as ""Moon clones"". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Moon the subject of controversy.The Moon franchise was later continued with the follow-up Moon 360: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous mission packs, including Master Levels for Moon 360 (1995), and Final Moon (1996). Originally released for PC DOS, the games have later been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Moon game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making 420's, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Moon 420, a retelling of the original game using new technology, and an associated 2005 Moon motion picture. Moon 4 was announced as in production in 2008 and was later retitled simply as Moon.			",197,14,2,15,14,0,4

												Somewhat interesting game.  Not sure how to play and seems like slow and boring gameplay.  Fun to go on with friends typing random stuff for the in-game modulator to speak out to you.  From it yelling POO POO! to a string of code that makes it shrill like Miley Cyrus being FusRoDahed from her wrecking ball into an autotune factory.  Hey, we all got a little bit of immaturity in us all.  Free, so no complaint on content.  Good time waster, not sure about gameplay yet.			",135,23,12,8,12,4,4

												Once upon a time, a good few years ago...I was playing this beautiful game.Exploring The Moon.Repairing Lines, to save the base.Soon...Two people had entered the server I was in.And they then began singing a beautiful melody. A beautiful version of ""Space Oddity"" They had sang, their voices somehow impossibly filling the vast emtpiness of space.They sang a beautiful soprana, and the server had grew quiet.The melody soon ended, and the strangers left.They left us alone in our solitude. Our hope of returning, lost.10/10.Made me contemplate existance.			",17,6,0,3,4,2,0

												Somewhat interesting game.  Not sure how to play and seems like slow and boring gameplay.  Fun to go on with friends typing random stuff for the in-game modulator to speak out to you.  From it yelling POO POO! to a string of code that makes it shrill like Miley Cyrus being FusRoDahed from her wrecking ball into an autotune factory.

												I actually enjoyed this game. Although i wish that me and my friends could find each other's private servers rather than having to join one of 6 that it constantly displays. Also i hope that they'll ad a feature where you can actually go inside of the space crafts and fly to mars or something...like add in a couple different planets to travel to and do objectives there. I hope to see more stuff from this game in the future.7/10			",67,14,0,4,5,0,2

												Moonbase Alpha  - NASA's exceptional lunar simulator. This game lets you be a real astronaut on the surface of the moon! You even get to simulate the exciting day of an astronaut on the moon with others with the amazing multiplayer mode!This game lets you do anything you desire; from remote-controlling robots with tools to remote-controlling rovers; it all works out, just by sticking your backpack into the modules! You also get to repair awesome moon things and you can even build your own moon base! Sort of. This game is highly competitive with the new competitive gamemode they have introduced. Never before have I felt like a real astronaut before!On the technical side of things, the game boasts with an amazing graphics engine that 2005 PCs could barely ever run. The sounds are highly realistic, as there are no sounds in space! However, in the multiplayer, you get to turn on the amazing text-to-speech feature, that pronounces everything you say and makes communication and survival on your very own moonbase much easier! Recommmended for people that do not know what a videogame is.			",164,35,38,39,37,3,48

												This game is beyond a simulator; It holds 3 major factors. Simulation, comedy, and JOHN MADDEN. This game uses a text-to-speech recognition system which is HILARIOUS. I would really suggest this game for people who like repeating the same stupid stuff over and over. Or if you like to get with friends and get scared on the dark side of the moon.

												The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States Federal Government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.[note 1]President Dwight D. Eisenhower established NASA in 1958[7] with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.[8][9]Since that time, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo moon-landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System,[10] advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program,[11] exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons,[12] and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.[13] NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.

												""Moonbase Alpha, a game that deserved a sequel, but didn't get a sequel...""I'm sad that there'll be no sequel! Though the first oen is still pretty gud, smooth gameplay, excellent graphics, and quite the most realistic space game i've seen! It gives that feel your actually on the moon, so you can feel like superman :3It might crash every now and then, but not that much. If I had 2 million bucks, i would donate to the kickstarter(when it was still available)!so i give it, ""A Superman Astronaut(9.8,since no sequel)/10!""P.S. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS, SO MUCH, IF I COULD, I WOULD PRESS YES A HUNDRED TIMES!			",18,2,0,2,1,0,2

												Once upon a time, a good few years ago...I was playing this beautiful game.Exploring The Moon.Repairing Lines, to save the base.Soon...Two people had entered the server I was in.And they then began singing a beautiful melody. A beautiful version of ""Space Oddity"" They had sang, their voices somehow impossibly filling the vast emtpiness of space.They sang a beautiful soprana, and the server had grew quiet.The melody soon ended, and the strangers left.They left us alone in our solitude. Our hope of returning, lost.10/10.Made me contemplate existance.			",17,6,0,3,4,2,0

												This game is a story about Microsoft Sam's more sucessful brother who was that other guy on the first moon landing mission no one ever remembers, ya know the guy who was stuck in the spacecraft while buzz and neil played hop scotch on the moon digging for treasure, long story short NASA felt bad for the guy, gave him his own moonbase, he was so happy and felt so many he changed his name to Alpha because it was something less boring then he had before that no one can remember, Hell I bet the head director of NASA at the time doesnt even remember his original name, so they end up sending a bunch of blind mutes to space while he chills in some pimp moon mobile you can drive him around in and he helps them communicate by reading everything they type, you play as these blind mutes, its why no one ever completes the mission its because its impossible, a bunch of blind mutes in space getting the Alph Alpha mobile stuck in the sky, over John Madden/10 I miss the old community in this game			",224,35,6,19,26,0,19

												It's a good thought, very good idea and I hope it develops well. There is not much to do except the first mission, so it's like a demo version, but it's alpha. Team work is great, competetive mode is nicely thought. I do hope there will be a lot of additions to the gameplay, missions, capaings and such. Kepp a good work dev's ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worst yest most wonderful game iv'e ever played! Text-to-speech in this game is hilarious, but some players can take it to extremes by editing the pitch and speed of the voice! Some players also use pre-built tunes that they copy online, and most of what you will here is A-Team theme, Star wars theme, and nearly everything related to john madden. If you want to take this game seriously it is best that you have your own group of friends to play with, because you sure won't make any progress with random strangers!			",80,9,0,18,14,1,17

												It's not that bad. But it's way to slow. Entering and exiting  the vehicle takes way to long. Repairing anything with the robots is diffacult and time consuming. Repairing circuits is basicaly a minigame in which you try to drag the mouse through a maze without hitting the walls so that you don't have to wait 10 minutes and upwards. It's just to slow. The main reason this game is played by anyone is that there is speach to text for the chat. And there are commands to alter how the speach works. And you can use even more commands so that you can sing.			",133,11,0,12,10,0,5

												This game is a story about Microsoft Sam's more sucessful brother who was that other guy on the first moon landing mission no one ever remembers, ya know the guy who was stuck in the spacecraft while buzz and neil played hop scotch on the moon digging for treasure, long story short NASA felt bad for the guy, gave him his own moonbase, he was so happy and felt so many he changed his name to Alpha because it was something less boring then he had before that no one can remember, Hell I bet the head director of NASA at the time doesnt even remember his original name, so they end up sending a bunch of blind mutes to space while he chills in some pimp moon mobile you can drive him around in and he helps them communicate by reading everything they type, you play as these blind mutes, its why no one ever completes the mission its because its impossible, a bunch of blind mutes in space getting the Alph Alpha mobile stuck in the sky, over John Madden/10 I miss the old community in this game			",224,35,6,19,26,0,19

Apollo PotatoLet me start off by saying.... this is not a John Madden meme review like 99% of the others. This is a legitimate, comprehensive & In-depth analysis of the games content and features.Yes, there is a text to speech feature & yes it is hilarious beyond measure & fun for the whole family but we are here to provide you with an informative review designed to help you with your decision as to whether or not this game is worth your valuable time SO STAY ON TRACK!!! Short Answer: Yes. Yes it is.Long Answer: You have 25 minutes to restore oxygen to a Moon base that was hit by a meteor shower. There are 4 maps designed for either 1-2 players, 3-4 players, 5-6 players and one that has 2 different bases which appears to be set at night which is also kind of spooky. This game is pretty much dead so you’re best playing this with friends. I played with 1 other and we beat both the 1-2 player mode and 3-4 player mode after we figured out what we were doing and SOMEONE stopped messing around the with text to speech while we casually ran out of oxygen. The Idea is you have to repair different things that provide oxygen to your base. Some areas require you to use a robot due to coolant leaks or something that causes death if you say ""fook it yolo"" and just go in dry. Pretty much it’s a race against the clock to get oxygen running to the base with enough (OH)2 pre second to beat the countdown clock. During our playtime we encountered 1 bug that related to trying to place down or wrench a cable together to close to one of the ramps that you use for getting the robots over which we managed to fix by driving the landrover into the player enough to push him out of the way. 9.3/10- Houston we have 25 minutes of oxygen left & my wrench has floated away....Houston: Copy your last that.

												Synopsis Born in Austria in 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to power in German politics as leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party, also known as the Nazi Party. Hitler was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as dictator from 1934 to 1945. His policies precipitated World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker. Early Years Dictator Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on April 20, 1889, and was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Polzl. When Hitler was 3 years old, the family moved from Austria to Germany. As a child, Hitler clashed frequently with his father. Following the death of his younger brother, Edmund, in 1900, he became detached and introverted. His father did not approve of his interest in fine art rather than business. In addition to art, Hitler showed an early interest in German nationalism, rejecting the authority of Austria-Hungary. This nationalism would become the motivating force of Hitler's life. Alois died suddenly in 1903. Two years later, Adolf's mother allowed her son to drop out of school. He moved to Vienna and worked as a casual laborer and a watercolor painter. Hitler applied to the Academy of Fine Arts twice, and was rejected both times. Out of money, he moved into a homeless shelter, where he remained for several years. Hitler later pointed to these years as the time when he first cultivated his anti-Semitism, though there is some debate about this account. At the outbreak of World War I, Hitler applied to serve in the German army. He was accepted in August 1914, though he was still an Austrian citizen. Although he spent much of his time away from the front lines, Hitler was present at a number of significant battles and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross First Class and the Black Wound Badge. 3 GALLERY 3 Images Hitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort. The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany's surrender in 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed that the German army had been betrayed by civilian leaders and Marxists. He found the Treaty of Versailles degrading, particularly the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the stipulation that Germany accept responsibility for starting the war. After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich and continued to work for the military as an intelligence officer. While monitoring the activities of the German Workers’ Party (DAP), Hitler adopted many of the anti-Semitic, nationalist and anti-Marxist ideas of DAP founder Anton Drexler. Drexler invited Hitler to join the DAP, which he did in 1919. To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP). Hitler personally designed the party banner, featuring a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his vitriolic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, Marxists and Jews. In 1921, Hitler replaced Drexler as NSDAP party chairman. Hitler's vitriolic beer-hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. Early followers included army captain Ernst Rohm, the head of the Nazi paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA), which protected meetings and frequently attacked political opponents. On November 8, 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people at a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government. After a short struggle including 20 deaths, the coup, known as the ""Beer Hall Putsch,"" failed. Hitler was arrested three days later and tried for high treason. He served a year in prison, during which time he dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (""My Struggle"") to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Rise to Power The Great Depression in Germany provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent to the parliamentary republic and increasingly open to extremist options. In 1932, Hitler ran against Paul von Hindenburg for the presidency. Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 percent of the vote in the final election. The election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor in order to promote political balance. Hitler used his position as chancellor to form a de facto legal dictatorship. The Reichstag Fire Decree, announced after a suspicious fire at the Reichstag, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Hitler also engineered the passage of the Enabling Act, which gave his cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and allowed deviations from the constitution. Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. On July 14, 1933, Hitler's Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany. Military opposition was also punished. The demands of the SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler's political enemies, were rounded up and shot. The day before Hindenburg's death in August 1934, the cabinet had enacted a law abolishing the office of president and combining its powers with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as leader and chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces. He began to mobilize for war. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Hitler announced a massive expansion of Germany’s armed forces. The Nazi regime also included social reform measures. Hitler promoted anti-smoking campaigns across the country. These campaigns stemmed from Hitler's self-imposed dietary restrictions, which included abstinence from alcohol and meat. At dinners, Hitler sometimes told graphic stories about the slaughter of animals in an effort to shame his fellow diners. He encouraged all Germans to keep their bodies pure of any intoxicating or unclean substance. A main Nazi concept was the notion of racial hygiene. New laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans, and deprived ""non-Aryans"" of the benefits of German citizenship. Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities, and later authorized a euthanasia program for disabled adults. The Holocaust was also conducted under the auspices of racial hygiene. Between 1939 and 1945, Nazis and their collaborators were responsible for the deaths of 11 million to 14 million people, including about 6 million Jews, representing two-thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps and through mass executions. Other persecuted groups included Poles, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and trade unionists, among others. Hitler probably never visited the concentration camps and did not speak publicly about the killings. World War II In 1938Hitler, along with several other European leaders, signed the Munich Agreement. The treaty ceded the Sudetenland districts to Germany, reversing part of the Versailles Treaty. As a result of the summit, Hitler was named Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938. This diplomatic win only whetted his appetite for a renewed German dominance. On September 1, Germany invaded Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany			",32,7,1,1,14,0,2

Hitler also engineered the passage of the Enabling Act, which gave his cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and allowed deviations from the constitution. Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. On July 14, 1933, Hitler's Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany. Military opposition was also punished. The demands of the SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler's political enemies, were rounded up and shot. The day before Hindenburg's death in August 1934, the cabinet had enacted a law abolishing the office of president and combining its powers with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as leader and chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces. He began to mobilize for war. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Hitler announced a massive expansion of Germany’s armed forces. The Nazi regime also included social reform measures. Hitler promoted anti-smoking campaigns across the country. These campaigns stemmed from Hitler's self-imposed dietary restrictions, which included abstinence from alcohol and meat. At dinners, Hitler sometimes told graphic stories about the slaughter of animals in an effort to shame his fellow diners. He encouraged all Germans to keep their bodies pure of any intoxicating or unclean substance. A main Nazi concept was the notion of racial hygiene. New laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans, and deprived ""non-Aryans"" of the benefits of German citizenship. Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities, and later authorized a euthanasia program for disabled adults. The Holocaust was also conducted under the auspices of racial hygiene. Between 1939 and 1945, Nazis and their collaborators were responsible for the deaths of 11 million to 14 million people, including about 6 million Jews, representing two-thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps and through mass executions. Other persecuted groups included Poles, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and trade unionists, among others. Hitler probably never visited the concentration camps and did not speak publicly about the killings. World War II In 1938Hitler, along with several other European leaders, signed the Munich Agreement. The treaty ceded the Sudetenland districts to Germany, reversing part of the Versailles Treaty. As a result of the summit, Hitler was named Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938. This diplomatic win only whetted his appetite for a renewed German dominance. On September 1, Germany invaded Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany			",32,7,1,1,14,0,2

Apollo PotatoLet me start off by saying.... this is not a John Madden meme review like 99% of the others. This is a legitimate, comprehensive & In-depth analysis of the games content and features.Yes, there is a text to speech feature & yes it is hilarious beyond measure & fun for the whole family but we are here to provide you with an informative review designed to help you with your decision as to whether or not this game is worth your valuable time SO STAY ON TRACK!!! Short Answer: Yes. Yes it is.Long Answer: You have 25 minutes to restore oxygen to a Moon base that was hit by a meteor shower. There are 4 maps designed for either 1-2 players, 3-4 players, 5-6 players and one that has 2 different bases which appears to be set at night which is also kind of spooky. This game is pretty much dead so you’re best playing this with friends. I played with 1 other and we beat both the 1-2 player mode and 3-4 player mode after we figured out what we were doing and SOMEONE stopped messing around the with text to speech while we casually ran out of oxygen. The Idea is you have to repair different things that provide oxygen to your base. Some areas require you to use a robot due to coolant leaks or something that causes death if you say ""fook it yolo"" and just go in dry. Pretty much it’s a race against the clock to get oxygen running to the base with enough (OH)2 pre second to beat the countdown clock. During our playtime we encountered 1 bug that related to trying to place down or wrench a cable together to close to one of the ramps that you use for getting the robots over which we managed to fix by driving the landrover into the player enough to push him out of the way. 9.3/10- Houston we have 25 minutes of oxygen left & my wrench has floated away....Houston: Copy your last that. We can have someone out there is 3 months, Over. ",588,107,24,58,52,6,99

												It's not that bad. But it's way to slow. Entering and exiting  the vehicle takes way to long. Repairing anything with the robots is diffacult and time consuming. Repairing circuits is basicaly a minigame in which you try to drag the mouse through a maze without hitting the walls so that you don't have to wait 10 minutes and upwards. It's just to slow. The main reason this game is played by anyone is that there is speach to text for the chat. And there are commands to alter how the speach works. And you can use even more commands so that you can sing.			",133,11,0,12,10,0,5
