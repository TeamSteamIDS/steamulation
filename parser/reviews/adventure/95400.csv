												Incredible and cute puzzle game! You can play it alone but i'd honestly advise to play with a team mate. The coop is much better and funnier. Some puzzles are a bit tough sometimes, but a good teamwork can solve any of them. It's a typical ps3 indie game, original, fun, cute, relaxing. Just awesome if you want to have a great time! I strongly recommend it :)10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Co-op Puzzle games ever to be created (It's up there with Portal 2), true Co-op in which you HAVE to play cooperatively with another person in order to move forward in the puzzle, and alot of time you both will need to be in sync too.The puzzles are challenging and very creative (again, up there with portal 2) and it's a great fun figuring the solution with a friend (especially if you two are on voice chat).The music and Art design are both very good too, the only minor problem i had with this game is that the camera can be abit clunky at times.I'm really enjoying this game right now playing it with a friend, bought it at a retail 14$ for a 2 pack and i think it's fairly worth it, on a sale it's a steal.

												 Ibb & Obb offers an AMAZING art style I have never seen in any other game. The puzzle design is brilliant and difficult if you play it by yourself. (I recommend playing it in co-op mode, it will be easier than you think), It reminds me to Thomas Was Alone with a crazy gravity system (similar to Portal).  The soundtrack is enjoyable, relaxing, soft and makes me want to buy the OST. The gameplay is a little confusing once you start playing, but you'll handle it later. Going back to the puzzles: although the puzzles are brilliant, once you have reached the fourth level, it will give you an instantly headache. The good: ◘ Relaxing, and quiet soundtrack.◘ Amazing art style ◘ Great puzzles ◘ Good gameplay quality (I recommend you to play it with a controller)◘ Amazing PC portThe bad: ◘ THE ♥♥♥♥IN HEADACHES ;_; Ibb & Obb it's a great option to buy if you are looking for a puzzle-platform game.

												TLDR: Great coop puzzle platformer, totally recommended.POSITIVE- It's very easy to get into, and fun to play. - Great minimalistic artstyle, smooth controls and platforming. Good music.- Puzzles are clever and needs team work. - It really needs cooperative work, so will help to improve team communication.- You dont need any controller to play, a keyboard is just enough for both players.- Online coop just works fine just as local coop, so you wont face connection problem when playing with friend through internet.- You can still play it alone but it'll be so hard without friend (so i recommend to get one lol)NEGATIVE-NoneIt's one of the best coop games I've ever seen and totally recommend to pick this up. Full price might be too much, but you can buy it on sale. Suggestion for devs: It would be a great if you guys add a mini extra football mode to just play it casual. I loved kicking those little creatures, it could be a great extra soccer minigame. (maybe a DLC?)			",754,206,27,89,52,8,88

												This game is a delight. It's simple and challenging in just the right amounts. Most of the puzzles stumped us when we first encountered them, but only for a few moments - never long enough to feel frustrating. It's a cycle of 'Whee! Wha...? Aha! Whee!'This isn't something I would normally praise but I also appreciate the lack of a backstory or anything like that. You just drop in and go. It gives the game an admirable clarify of focus: ibb, obb and things that make ibb & obb pop. What more do you need?Good stuff.			",58,22,1,3,9,2,6

												Ibb and Obb is purely a co-op game that has challenging puzzles and the art style is fantastic. This game is for you and a friend to sit down, relax and try beat the puzzles that the game has in stored for you. This game does have a single player feature which requires you to simutaneously control Ibb and Obb. This is very challenging and it can be frustrating at times. The soundtrack is enjoyable and relaxing. I think it suits the game well. I recommend that you buy it and have a go with a friend. Challenge yourselves in this wonderful and beautiful co-op game.

												So I played this for awhile with a friend that bought it for me. It made us feel like idiots, but we had fun. Well, I had fun, my friend got frustrated and ragequit.Some choice quotes from our play session:Friend: I'm too tired to do physics puzzles...Me: Science is super hard, dood. That's why I does arts and voice stuffs.Me: This reminds me of Antichamber, in the sense that I feel like I'm super smart for breezing through like 20% of the game then I get stuck and I'm like ""my brain is a soy nut"".Friend: HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO THIS, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!*3 seconds later, I figure it out and do it no problem*Me: ...Friend: Shut up. Just shut up.Me: I said nothing.Friend: I can hear your ♥♥♥♥ing smugness through the microphone.Friend: Wait, hold up, we have to go back for the floating crystal meth.Me: Kay.*Camera won't let us go back*Friend: ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SERIOUSMe: HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAHAHAFriend: gggrrrrrRRRRRRRRRMe: Well, ♥♥♥♥ us, I guess.Friend: Hey, what's that?Me: I think it's a thing.Friend: No♥♥♥♥♥♥ Let's touch it's butt.*We reach it, it's a portal to a hidden stage*Me: Oooh, bonus level!Friend: Awesome, let's do this.Me: Mmk, it doesn't look too hard.*30 minutes of failure later*Me: I think we both need to get checked for brain damage.Friend: THIS IS THE MOST CANCERFriend: Oh, I guess we can get out, there's another portal down here.Me: Yeah, I guess that's the ""I ♥♥♥♥ed up, I thought I was smart enough to do the bonus stage but I'm actually really dumb, please save me"" button.Friend: I can't handle this right now. I need to go play something brainless. Like League.My co-op experience was excellent; I laughed so hard that I had a coughing fit and got a nosebleed.10/10 would ruin a new sweater by bleeding on it again.EDIT: I should probably mention that for maximum co-op enjoyment, you and/or whoever you play it with should be drunk and/or exhausted, the two of you should be voice chatting via teamspeak or discord or whatever you prefer to use and one of you should record or stream it if possible so that your other friends can enjoy your failure and success (but mostly failure).

Almost at the end of the game, there was some lag that made me finish the game by myself. However this game brought me so much fun and challenges due to its entertaining yet quite difficult levels. My only complain about this game is that it should have being longer, having more levels to play, as it was quite short. I recommend this game 100% ",759,186,16,51,51,11,55

												I have a hard time reviewing games tbh. This game, however, is a part of a whimsical challenge attributed to the integrity of the friendship with the person you chooce to play it with. I have decided to play with a person I trust in the game world and not just a random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that wants to tell me what to do. These challenges, with your friend, are overcome through communcation with a mouse-trail of bubbles (or microphone lol) follow by lots of facedesk slamming, frustration, screen cracking, mouse breaking and blood-curdling, nightmarish bouts of war with the developers indirect laughs in your face. It is a brutal level design for each of the areas and even the smartest people lack common sense, I took a while to write this review because, this friend I chose, we both need breaks and a mutual time to participate in this game. It is well worth it and not only does it build onto the integrity of your friendship, but it creates hatred for self; the realization that one is not always the brightest and when you do finally realize something, how hard it is to communicate it.

												Great coop game. Ibb & Obb is a puzzle filled world, where gravity and momentum is what it's all about. Important aspect in this game is teamwork and patience. The moment you die, your partner dies and this can get frustrating at times. The checkpoints however are very fortcoming, allowing you to start almost always from the moment you died. Fun game and beautiful music. If you like the co-op part of Portal 2, I can higly recommend this game.			",913,575,25,175,192,10,134

												One of the most enjoyable co-op experiences I've had. Great puzzles, beautiful art style, cute characters, good music. Get a whole lot of mileage out of a handful of simple gameplay mechanics. You'll find yourself screaming in frustration,  shouting and pumping your fist in triumph, erupting in cathartic laughter as it finally seems you and your friend will accomplish the intricate, difficult procedure you've spent so long figuring out and attempting, only to see your friend make a stupid mistake and ruin everything at the last second.The game only lets you communicate with your online parter by drawing blobby, imprecise lines onscreen. This could be seen as a drawback, but in fact it becomes its own meta-puzzle: how do I explain this detailed series of actions that will involve precise timing, without using any words? You come to develop a rudimentary syntax; you start saying yes and no by moving back and forth and jumping up and down, respectively, or you draw frantic scribbles on the screen to indicate frustration. It's so much more satisfying to solve puzzles this way; you really feel like you've accomplished something beyond the game itself. Of course there are also those infuriating moments when you give up trying to use the in-game language and resort to Steam chat, or even make a phone call and talk through it in real time. And then there are transcendent moments when you and your partner both know exactly what to do without attempting any communication at all. It's also great fun to be a jerk and push your partner over cliffs or into enemies. If I have only one criticism it's that if you're playing with more than one friend (say, one online and one IRL) there's no reliable way to keep track of which levels you've finished with each friend. Like, I beat the game with friend A while I was only a few levels in with friend B, and then I'd start up the game with friend B and some of the puzzles would start to seem mighty familiar, and I couldn't be sure if it was only because I'd already played them with friend A, or because I'd also already played them with friend B. You can reset ALL of your progress, which would have made it easier to kow where I was with friend B if I'd started with them AFTER beating the game with friend A, but I had two games going at the same time so deleting my progress with friend A would have deleted the friend B's progress as well, and it wouldn't have been fair to friend A, either, if we ever decided we wanted to go back and try to get all the crystals on certain levels without replaying all the others. The option for separate play ""sessions"" could have solved this (I always thought having three save slots in the Zelda games was overkill, but now I see the reasoning behind it). But, lengthy complaint notwithstanding, this is really a minor problem.I was lucky enough to get this in a double pack as part of a bundle, but It's definitely worth the full price.

Ibb & Obb		* 7/10No story. No settings. Just Puzzles. End of Review.No, seriously, how can a game like this be so nice? Really, there's no story because it wouldn't change that much, the setting is irrelevant it's more about the art itself. The only thing that matters in this game is cooperative work, and that's because this game is Cooperative only, either local or via servers.So, this is a sidescroll platform and you have to play with a friend as Ibb & Obb. All you have to do is run the two fellas along the world. A world split in half by the ground and you can switch side through occasional portals in order to get past dangers or obstacles. Obviously the other side has an inverted gravity and this is just one of the many little things that you will notice along your runs with your friend as there will be many more obstacles and situations that will require cooperation and teamwork, tight syncronization and creative solution as the more you'll progress through the levels, the more complicated and elaborated the situations will be.The artistic aspect of the game is so minimalistic, but colorful and polished, kind of childish but it's not that kind of dumb childish. It's something relaxing and maybe a bit nostalgic. The music isn't anything outstanding but it's a very nice and light musical accompaniment that will encourage that relax sensation you have while playing this game.I must admit that I kind of get angry when I get stuck with games both for difficulty or unsolvable puzzles, but with Ibb & Obb it just doesn't happen. I stand and wait, I try to figure a solution, a workaround, I discuss with my friend a possible way to pass through and if we just can't figure it out we'll just end our session to resume the next days (with success).+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. This is the only thing that matters: the game is very a very simple sidescrolling platform, where you and your friend help each other to get ahead of obstacles and dangers. That's all. And it's so simple that it's fun. VISUAL ART. As already mentioned this game is very neat, colorful and simple. It's not even 3d and I never felt the need for it to be. MUSIC. A very simple music accompaniment will set a relaxing atmosphere as you proceed the game. The music will never try to get in the way but still can be appreciated.---CONs--- NETCODE. There must be something seriously wrong with the game's netcode because when I play it in coop with my friend sometimes it works just fine, but most of the times it just lags like hell, and sometimes we see each other's character just walk forward until it meets an obstacle or death. The strangest thing is that these situations seems to happen mostly in areas with multiple enemies, and this led us to the point where it was impossible to play from our own places, so I had to grab my laptop and reach my friend to play and finish the game. Unfortunately it seems like no efforts were made for this well known bug. FINAL RIDDLE. The final enemy seems to have just one way to beat it and it relies excessively in timing to the point that we thought that our solution was wrong because simply impossible. Actually we had to do everything in perfect timing not wasting a single step and second. This is not the kind of solution I was expecting considering the rest of the game... LOADING. Well, to say it plainly It wasn't much intuitive to load my progress the very first time, as you always begin your game and you should choose the platforms to jump on to load a map. Problem is: there's nothing written to recognize the map or at least its number, there's just the number of collected gems. MENU SETTINGS. Well, I can understand the fact that there's not much to set, specially for graphics, but maybe it would be useful at the very least the audio levels. Nothing really bad or necessary, but it might be useful.I played this game on these machines:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 ",497,128,12,20,23,4,28

												A very fun platfomer/puzzle co-op game, you run around the world as the two creatures ibb and obb while facing different puzzles and enemies that will keep you intrigued and guessing. Some of the puzzles can deffaintly be a bit challenging, however nothing game breaking. Obviously this game is tailor made for two people to play, however it can be played singleplayer too if you so desire. There's not much else to the game besides the main game, but you won't need much else has there are plenty of secrets and challenges to keep you playing for a while. Pick it up, grab a friend, and you'll have a great time, it's a blast.			",24,13,0,3,1,0,1

												The most co-op fun i have had in an age. The game itself is wonderfully produced and the score is fantastic. Every puzzle rquires you to rely on your co-op partner to solve. Lots of secrets to find too if you are willing to put the extra effort in ( and die 100 times trying ). It has so much charchter though that dying isn't the annoyance you think it would be. It just makes you want to try harder.A must for any fan of co-op games.Straight Up 10/10			",574,272,15,109,98,4,169

												Starts out very interesting and follows a good principle: simple enough that they players always know that they have all the tools they need to solve a puzzle. They also use very frequent mini check points, so you don't have to start a whole level over....But then it digresses into really tricky timing platforming with multiple challenging tasks in timed sequenses and the fun sort of drains off to exaspiration. Put another way, when you know how to solve a puzzle but they needlessly have easy to fail tight timing/positioning things that all have to be done as one continuous chain where either person can fail, and have to do it all over again. I think I'd rather play something else at that point.If you really really love tricky platforming (both pricision/timing and intelectualy challenging), you may really like this game. I liked if for a short while and then hit a point where it felt like a chore and I didn't want to pick it up again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have never wrote a review before but this game is so cute I had to. I bought this in a sale but I would say it's worth the full price as you will have so much fun with it!This is a lovely and fun game to play with a friend or a loved one as it is a fantastic puzzle solver. You will enjoy playing it even more if you use a microphone in multiplayer so you can communicate and help each other to complete the levels. It took me and my boyfriend 20 hours to complete it and to do the achievements. The 'Quality Time' achievement was a lot of fun to do and took a couple of hours to achieve. Both of us enjoyed playing this and had a lot of fun dying throughout due to the varied difficulty. The levels start off simple and as you progress the later ones become frustrating and a little troublesome, but if you keep trying you will eventually finish the game. We both became stuck on some puzzles for awhile but we found the solution by trying many different ways.It is quite interesting and difficult to find all the hidden crystals and obtaining the highest possible score on all levels, but there are guides that can help you with that.In the game you can move your mouse and some paint follows which I thought was an excellent way to show the person you're playing with if you had an idea. Also, when you finish a level ibb & obb do a dance which I found adorable. The whole of the game is bright and colourful, and is worth playing to the end so you can see the final cutscene.After completing the game I decided to craft the badge. The emoticons turned out to be pleasant to use and the backgrounds are cute due to the little characters on them. I will be using these often as they are my favourites.The only negative I'd have to say is that the last few levels were really difficult for me and I made my boyfriend do most of the bits because I couldn't, I probably would have if I practiced over and over. This game involves teamwork if you're playing on multiplayer and patience to finish it. Oh, and another thing, I wish there were more levels!10/10 for ibb & obb! <3			",451,324,6,35,59,5,54

												Ibb and Obb is a fantastic little multiplayer, not too long, and not too short, it  challenges the mind to solve the puzzles.  A fairly relaxing game, there is no time limit, or anything too serious about dying, so you really can ake your time around these levels and get full completion!recommended to anyone who games casually with friends online, the only downside is no singleplayer.

												One of the best made coop games I've played. It's made of intelligent level design, beautifully simple aesthetics, amazing music, and they manage to increase the difficulty level smoothly from more puzzly bits to get you used to the physics and concepts of the game, to a more platformy end that you can manage well with experience.Love it!Definitely a must-play.

												A simple yet challenging game where you decipher puzzles using gravity that flips, foward momentum, various platforms and even the other player. If you want to play a game that keeps your mind ticking over but isn't too intense and doesn't spoon feed you prolonged monologues or hours of cut scenes then this could be for you.This game is really for two players so be sure to have a buddy around.

												I just randomly found this game while looking for a co-op or multi-player to play with a friend. I stumbled upon this game and almost immediately knew I wanted to try it. I bought the Friend pack without too much looking into it and my friend and I started playing. I definitely don't regret it and recommend it for anyone who wants a cute, but challenging puzzle game to play with a friend. The colors and background shapes are serene and the soundtrack can be relaxing, but also upbeat. The entire vibe is cute and light, which isn't to say that you won't get frustrated. The puzzles definitely get serious and there are plenty of levels to work through for the price. The double pack is a good deal. There are even little hidden levels to find and conquer. You will want to go through each one more than once to explore and collect everything. I'm only half-way through the game, but I felt the need to stop and write this review because I'm so pleased with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You have ibb & obb, the two characters that use Gravity as a solution to puzzles that they find. I found this interesting since I played it with my sister, we were stuck on one of the puzzles but managed to solve it after 7 minutes xD.It is fun to play Local Game, As im saying, I played with my sister, and we enjoyed it alot. She doesn't like to play games, but this one made her Smile!I recommend this because I recommend this. xDMy rate: 10/10			",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												Ibb & Obb is one of the most amazingly cute games I will ever play. Very cute and clever puzzle game focusing on gravity and momentum.Several hours of coop gameplay and craziness can definitely be expected. And it really is coop, the teamwork and moments where one of you has about two seconds to live unless your saved by the other make for some intense moments with these cute little blobs.Me and my girlfriend have never yelled so much at each other or a game :D			",181,38,30,20,17,4,31

												For an indie puzzle game this is worth the buy for sure, the art is amazing, the game is fun, and can have some difficult puzzles at times. The soundtrack is amazing in my opinion, if you want to pay the extra few dollars for the soundtrack with the game, then I recommened you do so. The game does require a lot of co-op but, with a friend it's very fun, using voice chat would be easier in case people get stuck. The secret levels can be challenging (personal interest, took a couple of hours to do them all), worth playing with a friend who enjoys puzzle co-op, and music is really enjoyable to listen to.

Posted: November 15, 2015
												This game is cute, has great music and challenging puzzles. And you play it in cooperation with a buddy. What's not to like?The puzzles are challenging not only in regard to their solution. They often require both players to perfectly execute several steps in a row, with very little room for error. This can mean that you have already figured out the solution and make it halfway there but then you misstep: Start over. Then, your friend is too fast: Start over. Then, you jump a little too early:  Start over. Then, your friend hits an enemy: You know the drill. Solving a puzzle can get quite tedious.Another issue is savegames: One level took us up to an hour (in the later stages), depending both of how well we could crack the puzzle logic and execute the steps. During that, the game saved our progress just fine; if we failed a puzzle, we'd only be back at its beginning. But whenever we had to quit before finishing the level (or had a desync or just didn't feel like trying the same puzzle for the umpteenth time), the next time, we'd have to restart the whole level from the beginning.Finally, playing it with a friend across the ocean, we found that in-game voice chat was delayed by a few seconds. Maybe it doesn't happen with less of a distance between you and your co-player. For us, it didn't help, what with some puzzles needing near-perfect timing. Towards the end, we thought about using an external solution like Raidcall, but it never came to that.Overall, the game can get quite frustrating.Before this, we played Portal 2, which did a better job of e.g. the savegame issue by having many smaller levels, so if you had to quit at some point, you wouldn't have to replay as much as in this game. And there, when you already knew the steps leading up to where you'd left off, they were usually pretty easy to reproduce. If you're looking for a fun coop puzzler, I'd rather recommend Portal 2.

												The best co-op game I've tried until now. The gravitational twist to the game play makes this puzzle-platformer very entertaining.The colour schemes and backgrounds all play an active role in gameplay - and this effective use of all elements in the game is to be commended.The thing that weren't as on par was the slight lag in the voice chat feature. My partner and I used skype voice chat in order to get faster feedback. Also, it was a bit buggy, and sometimes we would both be over a ledge we weren't supposed to be. Not that we let that go to waste. :PA simple, yet mind consuming & addictive game is perfect for gaming with friends and couples alike.I rate it an 8/10 for overall game play.			",60,26,0,23,6,0,7

												ibb & obb is a puzzle platformer wrapped up in a beautiful and cute art style. Its simple presentation gets the job done. I was never once confused by mechanics as the game introduced them to me by showing me... and I didn't have to read one word. I was, however, often very confused by the puzzles! Which is a very good thing! My coop partner and I thoroughly enjoyed working together to solve puzzles and get the platforming tricks done. It's very satisfying to finally get through a puzzle and get to that party at the end of the level! There were even times when we got a bit snippy with each other because of the level of cooperation needed to get through. If you're considering buying this, just do it. I loved it. It's a perfect game to play with a friend. It was a real pleasure to play this game and I hope to see more from this developer!			",803,368,15,158,80,3,120

												ibb&obb is a really fun and addicting game if you play it together with a good friend of yours. I highly recommend buying the 2-pack bundle and to play with a friend.The game is kind of a physics puzzle platformer. It is self-explanatory, from the first to the last stage you will see new elements being introduced in a way that requires no further explanation. It's intuitive and fun to explore the new elements.The music in this game is a highlight. It matches the clean, calming artstyle perfectly and fits the athmosphere of the stages perfectly. Get the soundtrack if you can, you won't regret it.The replay-value of this game is ok. As long as you have more friends to play it with, there will always be one who you can introduce to this game and trying to get 100% of the crystals and secret stages with them is just as fun as trying it for the first time.What I dislike is that the audio volume resets every time you start the game, it's far too loud. Also, when playing with friends from overseas, the game suffers heavily from lag - not really the games fault, but I found that to be annoying sometimes, anyway.I'd recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet and who has a friend to play this together with. I could imagine that single player is too hard, as you'd have to control both characters at once, but maybe you'll like the challenge of that, too.			",77,2,4,1,3,1,9

												I love this game.  Bought the double pack for me and my fiance at Christmas and we just started playing it.  We love it, logging 3.5 hours so far with only two sessions (the first was cut short due to Steam updates, but we couldn't wait to play more!).  This is an adorable co-op game (co-op required, unless you're skilled enough to run both players yourself in local co-op) with fun challenging puzzles.  The annimations are really cute and the level design is excellent.  Every obsticle requires work from both players working together (not idle for carrying). The preferred method of play would be with some one you can talk to either over voice chat or in the same room, communication and teamwork are key.Overall this is a great bonding co-op game and I highly recommend it!

Positive:- Simplistic yet beautiful art style- Nice calming music- Simple, functional game mechanics- Gradual learning curve - Difficult challenges- Very fun and fair- Replay value (improve your score)Negative:- You need another playerConclusion:Ibb & Obb is a fantastic puzzle-platformer. It's mechanics and physics are simple enough but the game gradually becomes more complex such that you have to combine these simple mechanics to solve the later puzzles. While difficult, it is very fulfilling to finally solve them.I haven't tried playing this game with strangers online, but I can imagine it can be frustrating if you can't communicate properly (there is an in-game function to communicate with your partner but a voice chat would probably be more useful). Thus I would only recommend getting this game if you have a reliable friend to play it through with you. Still an excellent game though.			",191,40,3,20,12,2,11

Some of the puzzles can deffaintly be a bit challenging, however nothing game breaking. Obviously this game is tailor made for two people to play, however it can be played singleplayer too if you so desire. There's not much else to the game besides the main game, but you won't need much else has there are plenty of secrets and challenges to keep you playing for a while. Pick it up, grab a friend, and you'll have a great time, it's a blast.			",670,263,29,56,23,10,129

												This game is perfect for co-op, especially when you see the price of two games compared to one game.This game looks cute, and I guarantee you, it is. The world, but also the objects and living animals(?), look really beautiful.The nice thing about this co-op is, that you really need each other. I'm not sure if it's even possible to play it alone.Also, the hidden levels bring a really nice touch to the game.The game is hard to play though, it's not easy, especially when you also want to complete the hidden levels, which are even harder than the normal game.What I also like about this game, is that it is developped by two Dutch companies, which I like, because I am Dutch. But even without this I would defenitily recommend this game!i would definitely recommend this game!!Info about the badge and emoticons of the game (NOTE: this is not in the game itself, it costs extra money):Nice about the game, but not really interesting for most people, I guess, is that the game has really nice badges.. At least the level 5 badge and the foil badge. The level badges below 5 I forgot about, so not talking about those. Also, the game has really nice emoticons, that you could get when crafting the badges. Especially the emoticon: :pinkheart:. I had the heart quite some time, then I found out, it's actually Ibb and Obb combined in a heart. This heart is also the level 5 badge.			",168,93,3,12,31,2,30

												Ibb and Obb is an absolutly wonderful game. It has a way of explaining all of it's simple mechanics without using any words. You find them out as you progress. Along with the simplicity of it comes the smooth and pleasant art style that just makes you happy despite some of the puzzles making you furious. It is a great game and I would gladly suggest it to any two people looking for something to do together.			",107,7,0,8,9,0,8

												I love this game so much. First of all, This game is so much fun in co-op mode when you are voice chatting with friends on like skype or teamspeak, the voice-chat in the game Ibb & Obb has a big delay and does not sound very good. So we used teamspeak instead. Some levels are pretty hard to get through but that makes the game even more fun, because my friend and I are raging the hell out of it. The Design of the entire game is fantastic. It has that simple look and the colours are vibrant, which I really like. Also the music is so awesome in this game, the music is really dreamy and fantasy which I really enjoy while I was playing this game.I totally recommend this game to everyone who likes to play a friend (unfortunately with 1 friend) in games, Then please buy this game and have a lot of fun! :)			",41,13,3,1,7,0,2

												This seemingly simple little indie game is so much more than I expected! I have been having an absolute blast playing this game with my friend. It's a similar experience to what we had playing Portal 2 co-op, occasionally hurting our brains trying to solve a puzzle and then facepalming when it becomes blatantly obvious (after you've spent 15 mins trying to solve it of course). ibb & obb actually has us both in tears a few times, just dying with laughter as we repeatedly fail jumps and die to the Studio Ghibli-esque wandering soots.The graphics are PHENOMENAL - the simplicity of it all works so well and the vibrant colours make me so happy. Even the darker levels were executed so well and add to the game: You have just enough vision so that it doesn't hinder you playing (like so many other games where you can't see 2 inches in front of your face) and it's fun not being able to see the soots. Nothing like a spikey lil surprise to make your day eh?Not gonna lie, I normally rage a bit while playing platformer/repeatedly dying games. Like I said earlier I've had the exact opposite happen..I cry with laughter when we keep dying. The whole atmosphere of the game is very zen-like and relaxing, and the gameplay is just so fun (lots of wooshing and sounds are made while flying through the sky) that I haven't raged or gotten annoyed whatsoever..which is great. :)Can't recommend this game highly enough. What're you waiting for go grab a friend! And if you don't have any friends...you should rent one for a day just so you can play this game. It'll be worth it, I promise.			",333,128,10,34,44,6,46

Great game to play with a friend, not so sure about random matchup.

												22 people playtested it and we got soft locked 3 times throughout the game.  Took ~6 hours to beat the game with most secrets.  Every stage was reasonable fun except for the spotlight stage and the final stage which was shockingly horrible.  You literally hold right and die to instagib max speed falling saws then you get to restart and do it again with your new found knowledge of random saw placements.  Just another good idea for a game with sub-par level design.  Also if you spam start + back on controller during the end credits it asks if you want to enter event mode and crashes the game :) fun way to end it after the awful last stage.			",54,5,1,4,5,0,0

												The artwork is very charming, but the game is deigned to be too much of a puzzle with a single set solution. Many mechanics are quite punishing for little reason. I found that they made it all too easy to unintentionally grief your teammate, through no fault of your own.There were some interesting concpts, but some of the puzzles required your coop partner to sit there and watch you as you failed over and over again despite knowing the solution to the puzzle.There are a lot of creative things about this game, but I alsso believe they made a lot of questionable design choices.Why do you die everytime your idiot ally dies?Why is it that for a coop I never feel like I'm working together with my teammate?Why am I always getting in the way of my teammate and greifing them?Why do these puzzles only have one solution to get past them?On the other hand they have beautiful stylization, and what aI believe to be a very pretty communication system that you use without words, But this game is very unintentional.I did however love the pricing for a twopack and I believe that all coopgames should follow a similar model wherein you are required to play with someone else, but an extra copy of the game costs a little bit more.

												Great fun to play, with a wide number of challenging logic and timing-based puzzles for co-op play. A lot of fun with a friend.However, it is let down by substantial, frustrating network issues causing desyncs and strange behaviours. We would have finished the game a whole session sooner if it hadn't been for repeated crashes and desyncs. If you're lucky, you won't encounter the same, but based on my experience I can't recommend the game.			",254,32,9,28,20,3,30

												Might be a fun game, but lack of colorblind-friendliness was a dealbreaker.The game's puzzles were fairly easy as far as I played, although I didn't much care for the way the two players can quite easily push each other into danger (resulting in many many needless deaths).I might like to play a version of this in the future with red and blue (for example), which would make it far more playable.

												ibb & obb is a super cute platformer, which is designed for two people to play. Some of the puzzles can be quite easy, yet some can be really frustrating. Single playing is a big NoNo!, as it is just way to hard/stressful to complete some of the more advanced puzzles; so playing with a friend is recommend, as it's so much more fun and super silly at times. So if you are overwhelmed by the games cuteness, love the mixture of dark/magical levels or just love puzzle games/brainteasers; this game is definitely for you. It's a no-brainer =P ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great puzzle co-op game and if you play online like i managed to do it is a lot of fun trying to communicate with eachother. The progression of the puzzles is good and it is also great fun to play with a friend. This game deserves more attention than it is getting and because of this it is VERY hard to get a multiplayer(online) game. It is a great experience and i suggest buying a 2-pack to play with friends.			",77,15,0,8,7,1,3

												I had never heard of this game, but I stumbled across it while searching for online co-op games to play with a friend.  I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I like this game so much that I wanted to spread the word.The basics: In Ibb & Obb, you are in a world that has an unusual form of gravity.  If you look at the screenshots, you can see that there is a line that roughly divides the playfield into a top and bottom.  When you are above this line, gravity works how you would expect.  When you are below it, you ""fall"" up, towards the line.  (In other words, you're always attracted to the line.)  You can only switch sides at the various gates in the level (the particle-y lines in the pictures).  ORdinarily these gates are white, but some gates are red or green.  Anyone can go through a white gate, but only the character that matches the color of the gate can pass through the red and green ones.The challenge comes from cooperating with your partner to solve the puzzles.  This often requires making clever use of your momentum when switching from one side to the other.  As you can see in the video, enemies can be killed on one side of the line, but the player on the other side has to collect the gems.What I like:This game is gorgeous.  I find the colors to be very satisfying, and I find the overall art style to be very pleasant.  Obviously not everyone may agree, but I want to really commend the developers for making such a stylish game.Same thing for the music.  Pretty much as soon as the game started, I thought, ""Wow, this music is great.""  I never really stopped thinking that.The gameplay is also fun.  The puzzles start off fairly simply to introduce you to the mechanics, then start to become a little trickier.  This is especially true once you realize that there are optional gems floating around in some places - getting these requires more thought than simply figuring out how to beat the level.  So far, the puzzles are hard enough that you feel satisfied when you beat them, but not so hard that you ever get frustrated.I'd also like to mention the way this game is packaged.  You can buy a single copy, and it would be a fair price, but for slightly more money you can buy a double pack and gift a copy to a friend.  This game is definitely meant to be played with a friend, and the devs make it very easy to do that by so strongly incentivizing the double pack.What I don't like:Honestly, I don't have any complaints so far.  I've really been enjoying this game.What I don't know:I'm not sure how long the game is.  That information might be available, but I haven't really checked.  Given how reasonably priced the game is, especially with a double pack, I don't feel like it would have to be super long for me to get my money's worth.  I'll update this if I end up beating it in 15 minutes the next time I play, but I haven't even seen all the areas highlighted in the screenshots, so I don't expect that to happen.Conclusion:I highly recommend this game.  It's beautiful, fun, and clever.  I only wish that I'd heard about it sooner!			",101,30,2,8,11,1,16

												Great game. It's pretty difficult when you're playing with someone and they aren't the best at listening, but that just makes it more fun. These days, most games are about random teammates, which isn't that fun, as you don't get to have that old school bonding moment while playing. I feel like this game captures that perfectly. I haven't completed the game yet, so I'm worried that the game will be a short one, but I suppose since it's so good, that will make up for it.Amazing art. Perfect soundtrack.

												Simple, tough and fun but with somewhat long-drawn courses. I recommend this game since it has the perfect amount of challenge (= pretty high) yet still remains fun. My partner gently disagrees (I'm surprised he didn't throw the controls into the wall) it requires two persistent players to keep the game moving forward at a general pace. The simplicity of both style and controls are wonderful, the downside is that it gets a bit repetitive after a while. All in all it still remains the easy-to-learn / tough-to-master type of game which I love. Now I only guess I have to find a new player 2.			",54,8,1,3,7,0,3

												Are you looking for another fun puzzle game? As a fan of the genre myself, I can say I look often. This game stood out for it's art style, co-op, and simplicity.When it comes to puzzle platformers, ibb & obb uses a recently popular mind-bending alteration on physics. Many of its peer platformers have also used dual or mirrored characters, but not quite in this same way. In those, you the player are able to control both. Here, each character must fend for himself, but also cooperate to succeed. It has taken cues from the co-op element of Portal, but is still self-contained.While I typically don't enjoy platformers in the genre, this was an exception. Simplicity is key, and the developers executed it very well. It doesn't remain the same throughout, and there is clear progression in the art, but it's always minimal, clean, and fresh. The smooth dream-like artistry behind it, including the music, is excellent and I applaud it.There is hardly any story, which is fine with this game, and what exists is only shown visually, and you are up to interpret it. It's not as integral, but makes for a neat dynamic if you think about it. I think this part could be developed further. While it's clean, and I like that, it's not overly progressed. It appears, and then goes nowhere. Because of this, it doesn't stick with you long after you play. It's good and lovely mental and cooperative exercise, but not much more.The puzzle difficulty is variable, and you can choose to pursue more challenging ones that don't hinder you from the main drive. Co-op makes this a lot of fun, as you decipher these physics traps together. It's a good communication and team-building exercise also. It certainly delivers on mental puzzlers, and if you enjoy them, I recommend it to you.			",73,16,1,7,12,0,5

												Ibb & Obb looks like it might be a good game to play with your young kid.  Simple graphics, relaxing soundtrack, cartoon atmosphere.  But it's actually pretty darn challenging for myself and my brother, who are in our early 20s.  The game requires a lot of 2D spatial critical thinking, and anyone younger than a teenager will probably have difficulty with the game.Ibb & Obb is a bit different from most puzzle platformers because the primary object you use to overcome obstacles is your partner, instead of the usual items or abilities in your inventory.  When one of you dies, both of you die.  However, the dev was smart and makes you respawn almost immediately and very close to where you died.  This allows the game to keep its relaxed feel, and when you die, myself and my brother found ourselves laughing instead of getting frustrated, because there's no real penalty for dying.Cool game and a good soundtrack make this a recommendation for me.  The only downside to the game is the simplistic graphics, but all the other ""Pros"" to the game outweight that single Con.			",1629,709,37,197,140,14,246

												I was really pleasantly surprized when I played this game. I was not expecting much at all, but I'm glad I was pushed into playing it by a friend. In a sense, the game feels clean and simple, but it gets more and more challenging as one goes on. And guess what? I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT! And I haven't even finished it! If you're usually pessimistic about indie games, and the simpilisity of the game bothers you to the extend that you expect it to be broken; then you are going to get the shock of yourlife, because this game is fantastic!

												This is an excellent cooperative game for those who like cooperation, and would like to hate who they are playing with.  Every single puzzle in the game requires both players to know what is going on, and to communicate constantly.  Voice chat is pretty much mandatory.  The puzzles are super-clever, and you will inevitably explore every detail of the mechanics to get the most out of every situation.  In my personal experience, I was practically screaming at my teammate by the end of the game, and it was awesome.  5/5 would inappropriately swear again.			",303,65,3,23,24,4,39

I'll just say this: If you think the trailer looks like your cup of tea, then go hit that ""buy"" button. It's great.And yes - it runs like a charm on Linux. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is challenging yet fun.  Playing with my friend Holy, we took the game head on and found ourselves having no choice but to work together to get through the levels.   Having to collect the coins quickly before they disappear also encourages us to be on opposite sides: so one of us can kill the monster, while the other is in position to collect the coins.We uploaded a video of us playing the first level or so, check it out if you want to see some game-play:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv4A-IB5Nlw ",219,66,1,47,34,2,23

												Pros:- Beautiful art schema is simplistic in its design yet the colors pop out at you- Soundtrack is a mix between ambiance and smooth electronic that'll lull you into a relaxed state- Controls are tight and responsive and make platforming a breeze- Lack of story allows more focus to be put on puzzles- Don't let the game fool you; these levels offer mind-bending challenges- Multiplayer works well and adds social depth to the overall experience- Runs well even on lower end machinesCons:-Game is desgined around multiplayer. If you don't have internet or a friend that could help, you could be stuck on a single puzzle for hours that would otherwise take 10 minutes-There are no checkpoints anywhere throughout the levels. If the game crashes, you'll have to start at the beginning of the level all over again.-Sometimes hard to connect to someone online for multiplayer-Doesn't have much replayability valueOverall Score: 7.5/10 ",75,15,0,4,6,2,6

												A cutsie game with actual challenge to your mind. I honestly suck at puzzles, so maybe it's just me, but I really find this game relaxing - yet at the same time challenging. Some of the tasks that ibb & obb have to go through, are pretty intense and require teamwork and a lot of thinking. I've only played a couple of hours, basically because of the colors and the music. I feel like I could lose my mind if I kept on playing for longer periods of time at once. If you have a good friend, or someone you'd like to get to know better throughout a game, this is really the one for you. + Ibb & Obb are the cutest characters in a while, yet so simple. + The milieu is beautiful and the background music fits the surroundings. + You can actually get different types of points, depending on how much diamonds you collect. - The game's been hard to start for many. (Including me). For me, changing the steam text layout settings helped, some might need to use other techniques to make the game start. Once you find out how; there's nothing stopping you.

												Highly recommended. One of the very best co-op games I've ever played, probably because it's obviously made to be played with a mate. Even though it can be played alone, it would be much harder and far less fun.Most challenges you'll encounter are incredibly clever, very simple but not at all obvious. It will put your brains to work without getting too frustrating.It's really beautiful in both visuals and audio. The world is very colorful and vivid, the music plays a great part in the game's feels and every detail is carefully polished in both areas.I totally recommend buying a two-pack. Best quality fun I've had in co-op gaming in a long time!			",729,233,36,76,91,7,117

												Best way to bond with a friend while yelling at each other or screaming ""It's my mistake, I'm so so sorry!"" The game is super adorable and the puzzles sometimes seem easy at first but are eventually a hell to execute. I wouldn't want another hell though! Sometimes we've been trying a puzzle for almost an hour and the satisfaction to completing it, is the best feeling I've ever experienced. The art style is also amazing, simple but it played with colours, music, even size! It does require strong teamwork, since timing is SUPER important in this game. It's been such a laugh and I will definitely have some nostalgia over this, since now we'll have to find a co-op game as good as this one, and that will be a difficult task! Thank you so much for creating this game!!And by the way, can I tell you how much of a troll this game is? You'll have to complete it to find out, I guess ;) #Weilai			",20,16,0,3,4,1,2

												This game was actually pretty fun. Up until the last level, my online partner and I were having a blast. Then, due to the lag and desync issues present in the game that the devs have been talking about fixing for over a year now, the last bit of joy left this game and I quickly went from enjoying the game to absolutely hating it.  The fact that this game relies on precision timing so much with such prevalent lag issues makes me give this game a negative review.I'd recommend this to players playing on the same computer, however, not to players online.

												ibb & obb might be the most adorable game I've ever seen.Psychedelic colors swirl around the screen, weird geometric characters dance about, parties are thrown for no reason whatsoever; it's just so 'effing cute and I wanted so much to fall in love with it. But playing ibb & obb is like petting a dog and having it bite your fingers off. It's cuteness is equally matched if not exceeded by its degree of frustrating, nonsensical design decisions, to where my head began to hurt so much I'm not sure how I ever managed to complete the trek through hell that was somehow hiding below the delightful exterior.Just to be entirely clear, ibb & obb is coop only, meaning you better have a friend ready and willing to brave its horrors with you before you even press start. And to this point there are some pretty cool ideas buried here, which force you to play cooperatively and make clever use of its main gravity inverting hook. There are two sides to every level, with each flipping your character over like you've cut a hole straight through to the other side of the world and gravity hasn't yet realized.Using both characters in tandem is almost always required to allow both to progress, be it providing a step up onto a ledge or using momentum to carry each other through. It's a fantastic hook but its implementation here is unbelievably hamstrung and convoluted. The camera that has to contend with two characters often going in opposite directions bears much of the blame, often obscuring parts of the environment or even your character entirely as you fight against it to keep moving as it holds you back. The pretty environments come at the const of making levels difficult to even comprehend, often blending so well with platforms or bubbles I needed to float in that I often had no idea they were something I needed to interact with.Puzzle designs, while on occasion genuinely brilliant, are often constructed such a ridiculous manner that numerous times throughout the game I thought we were breaking the game finding their solutions. So many moments are needlessly tedious and absurdly challenging, forcing literal split-second timing which its floaty, imprecise controls make cumbersome at the best of times and a living nightmare at its worst. Each new mechanic introduced only seems to worsen the already overburdened experience, leaving exasperated and fatigued before I was even halfway through. The abundance of network lag (which from what I've gathered is by no means an isolated issue) made parts of the game nearly impassible, as if the game was at last telling me to give up as my character ran wildly around at his own inclination.The dissonance between ibb & obb's truly marvelous artwork and mellow soundtrack and it's reprehensible gameplay is probably one of the most shocking I've ever experienced. It's bewildering and depressing, and I'm still finding it hard to fathom how miserable an experience it was to play when it all seemed so wonderful from the outside.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												The game is awesome. I absolutely love it but, I am stuck on the last level with a buddy of mine, and the game has so much lag and desync, that the Sea Urchen, Nematoads, The black spikey things with White Eyes, get glitched and stuck on my screen when they aren't there for my partner. So we can't beat the level the way we are supposed to, or else we would probably be done with the game. Until it gets fixed, or my internet does, We can't beat the game. But, other than that, the game is FANTASTIC. Love it! Classic!			",99,2,3,3,6,2,7

												I wish I could recommend this game, but there are issues which cannot be ignored. I can't in good conscience say that someone should get this game until they're fixed. I will admit though that some of these issues are due to being disabled, which will result in some hate (because as we know the only people who like disabled people are disabled people), but I need to talk about this.Screen ZoomingI have poor sight, so when the screen suddenly zooms way out I find it easy to lose track of my character, or I'll get vertigo and my precision will be off. In a game with online multiplayer, this kind of zooming is unnecessary and only serves to irritate the player. An online game should use a set zoom (with the zoom level in the options). A pointer could point the position of the other character. This wouldn't really require much extra code as there's a pointer that tracks the other player in-game right now (if one player goes too high off screen, it'll show the position of the player lower down), which makes this even more baffling.If this were fixed for online games, it would make the experience much more enjoyable. As it is, the constant stretching and shrinking, stretching and shrinking, stretching and shrinking makes me feel nauseous. I understand that a temporary zoom to show what you need to do may sometimes be necessary, but just trigger that then have the zoom go away. Or even give the player a 'zoom out' toggle key which they can use whenever they want.But making it zoom and zip around like mad makes it feel like a Ubisoft game where the controls are so often stolen away. This would be a much, much, much more playable experience if this was fixed.CollectiblesI have an anxiety disorder. Whenever I fail to get collectibles, I feel like I've failed my co-op partner. For some people, this is exciting, exhilarating, and fun. For me, it results in my heart racing, pounding, and feeling faint and panicky. That sense of panic will grow and my hands will start shaking. Combine this with the above issue and I find ibb & obb (especially on the harder levels) a genuinely unpleasant play experience.This could be fixed by having an option so that they don't decay. I know that there are some nutty, obsessive cheevo-hunters out there who're hardcore or no-core, so just disabled the Steam achievements tied in with collectibles if the co-op partners agree to turn on the option to stop the collectibles from decaying. That way, it's an option, which doesn't hurt anyone, and the hardcore cheevo-hunters can have their hadcore cheevo-hunting.As it is, though, the decay makes this a stressful experience. Otherwise, it would be a pleasant, enjoyable, serene, cerebral experience. It would be more like Portal 2, then. I love Portal 2, standing around and trying to figure out a test chamber without the immediate pressure of ermahgerd I stepped on a thing, now the collectibles are going to decay, whatever will I do? So I won't be playing much more ibb & obb due to this.Of course, this means that the collectibles will stick around if you die, too. I know, gosh, such a carebear. But I'm an old fart with disabilities, I'm not 15 any more. We can't all be perfect.It just really, really frustrates me because I could see the potential of this as a serene puzzler, it could be in my top ten with the likes of Myst and Portal, but this silly, ridiculous design decision to cause stress and anxiety for no good reason just does so, so much to ruin the game. And it does ruin the game. And it is stupid. And it does stop it from reaching its potential. I just want to shake some sense into the developers, because it could be so much more. It's so close to being an epic cult classic for the ages.Game SyncingThis may not be fixable, but it's a very serious issue. It also triggers my panic in various ways.Way 1:""You didn't get the collectibles.""""Yes. I did. I really did.""""No, you didn't. I saw them explode all over the place and you didn't even bother with them.""""But ... I caught the ball before it exploded.""""Not on my end.""""I did on my end, honest! I caught it!""""Have you seen me ignoring collectibles?""""Yeah, but I didn't want to say...""""Welp, that's a bug.""Way 2:""You need to get rid of this porcupine.""""I did. I did that a while ago, and the collectibles popped out. I saw you get some of them.""""...none of this happened.""""I think it's bugging again. Here, let me come back. Is this where the porcupine is?""""Yes.""""It can't harm me...""""Look, it'll kill me.""""Well damn. How do we fix this?""""Keep trying until it works, I guess?""It took me and one co-op partner some time to figure out that there were syncing errors. I'm very hesitant to play it with any of my other friends as we'd have to go through this again and again, with each new person playing. This isn't my idea of a fun time. The game should at least mention that these bugs can occur when booting the game if they can't be fixed. It causes a lot of friction between co-op partners.ConclusionThis very flawed gem has the potential to become the next Portal 2, one of the best co-op puzzle experiences on Steam, perhaps even the best co-op experience on Steam. But the first of these two issues need to be fixed, the latter should be fixed, but if extenuating circumstances don't allow it, at least warn co-op partners that it can happen to alleviate potential stress.This could be good. Could be. As it is, it makes me a bag of stress with shaky hands. I can't help but dislike it for that. I don't want too. I want to like it. But the way I feel about it means that I can't recommend it.It's great if you have perfect sight, motor control, and no anxiety. It's great if you can put up with the game sync issues without getting stressed. In that case? I recommend it without reservation, go ahead, it's the most fun you can have with co-op puzzling outside of Portal 2. But for anyone whom these may be an issue for? No.No. I just can't recommend this. I want to, but I can't. Please fix these issues so that I can recommend ibb & obb. I really, really want to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As of my first 1.5 hours, I haven't really appreciated this game much. My co-op partner and I found the puzzles to be minimally challenging for far too long, and I feel like my interest has been lost. Though I really would like to complete the game, I'm not sure that I will find the motivation. For reference, I really like Portal and indie platformers tend to appeal to me, but Thomas Was Alone lost me in a very similar way.On the plus side the aesthetic has a modern, minimalistic appeal and the animations are well done, and that was a big draw for me when I purchased the game. The game controls well with Xbox 360 / One controllers and the game detected them without issue. Those that appreciate the gameplay should find that the rest of the game is quite well made, though the sparseness of the settings menu can be a turnoff.I did experience some tiny framerate issues on my system with a mid-end i5, Radeon HD6870, and a solid state drive, but nothing that significantly hampered the gameplay experience. Though I will hesistate to blame the framerate problem on the game since it could be attributable to a problem with my system, I want to note that this PC runs most other games without hickups and it well exceeds the recommended system specs.Concluding, I think this game has charm and will absolutely appeal to some people, but it was not my cup of tea. Though I can't honestly recommend this game because I didn't enjoy it, I feel that it is absolutely worth a try if you think it might appeal to you.			",333,95,6,44,33,4,48

												I cant really recommend this game to anyone who'd want to play it with a friend.or alone for that matter, read below to find out whyI actually played this game ""offline mode"" for about 2 hours with a friend then he got really bored and we closed the game.Then I restarted it and played in a bit more than 3 hours in alone to finish the game and I almost did.See the base idea is nice, two characters each one depending on the other, each has its own special colored doors to enter through it and help each other reaching the next platform reaching the end.its a one touch death game, when one dies the other one does too, so you restart from the last chickpoint. Whats good The artwork is nice, although not that different, but you get the idea and its nice.Music is good and soothing.World design is simple and lovely. Whats bad -Animations are clunky to say the least, they might not look like it that much but its not perfect.-Gameplay is ok but there isnt really much to do after 1 hour, its the same thing, step on my head so i lift you up to the next place ... etc.-Its really really boring after 2 hours.-There is no story to go on with, nothing really keeping you in the game itself.NOTE I actually found the game easy enough to play it alone until almost the end, wasn't really that challenging ""Not trying to brag"" it just was too easy considering I am playing it by myself, controlling two characters in one keyboard.Its really sad that I really looked forward for this game at the beginning,  but got quickly disappointed when I saw its serious lack of content.I THANK HEAVENS that I got this from a bundle trade, because 11.99$ Is WAY too much for a game that runs out of ideas after 1 hour and can be finished in 4.I am sure people would disagree with this review but whatever the game really is not that good I am so surprised it has so many positive reviews, probably the rewards made people feel the game is better ? I don't know, I usually go crazy for this type of game.I actually got 2 achievements in the game, wondering why they dont appear here, maybe due to offline mode			",686,176,16,69,45,5,48

												I was a bit hesitant about getting this game. It looked like the kind of game that would start off good then become too frustrating and it is always difficult to say whether or not it would remain fun for long enough for the game to be worth getting. I gave this game a chance anyway because local coop games are so few are far between. So how long did it take to for this game to get annoying and frustrating? Twenty minutes… yes after only three levels this game had exhausted it capacity for fun. The game requires a degree of coordination between the players that was way beyond my partner and I. After my partner gave up on this game I attempted to play a bit more on my own but this game has no single player mode, you can play controlling both characters but again this requires a level of coordination I don't possess. There is also online play but if I couldn't muster the required level of hive mind communication with my partner on the sofa next to me then I how am I going to manage it with some random on the internet? So if you are a member of the Borg collective looking for a challenging game to play with a fellow drone, this might be the game for you. If you are looking for a bit of casual fun with friend this is probably not the game for you.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												TOO cute, a green one and a pink one, partners in collecting rewards and avoiding deathYou die, THEY DIEThey die, YOU DIEVery clever design.. fun puzzle game with sidescrolling perspective and some platformer elements, coop is where the game reaches its potential - be it internet or local.. I tried playing with both sets of keys but that is tricky; unless you're ambidextrous or very very persistent or both, this will probably end up being pretty frustrating and you will not get all diamonds (or whatever those white things are)Single player is definitely a viable way to play though, just tricky. Coop is where to be..			",260,38,11,16,13,3,16

												If you, and a friend are looking for a good time, and a true co-op experience, then Ibb & Obb is for you. The soundtrack is amazing, and the game looks beautiful. 15 levels doesn't seem like much, but don't be fooled the puzzles can be challenging. Just shy of 10 hours, and I see myself playing through Ibb & Obb multiple times! 10/10p.s Level 15, I'm not sure if it is a bug or connection issue, but it gets very glitchy. During the chase some of the ""monsters"" will spawn for one player before the other player making it almost impossible to get past. Only way around was to die multiple times until it was set right.			",199,26,3,14,17,4,13

												Ibb & Obb is a gravity-based puzzle-platformer.Which isn't to say you manually adjust gravity, as with some games, but that the entire game is composed of things like 'slow fall bubbles', trampolines, looped falling (where you drop from the sky after falling off the bottom of the screen), and reverse-gravity wells.Despite fairly simple concepts, the puzzles quickly move from charming and cute and simple, to demanding and clever.Unlike twitch/reflex platformers, once you actually figure out the trick to a puzzle, you're good to move on, which makes this a game more about testing your wit, than your reflexes- though timing is certainly important, as well.Ibb & Obb is one of the best co-op experiences I've had in a while, and I can certainly recommend it-Though there's some things I unfortunately have to point out.||PROS||* Co-op only play guarantees an experience built with co-op in mind at all facets. * Puzzles are based around clever reuses of a small set of objects, presented in more and more complex ways, thus creating a steadily progressing experience where you build off what you've learned from your previous successes, rather than having to start each puzzle from scratch.* Ibb & Obb (the two player-controlled characters in the game) are different sizes. This can have some interesting effects on gameplay, and is actually crucial to later puzzles. It's a nice twist that keeps each co-op partner feeling distinct in their roles. Similarly, the use of color-coded barriers limits which character can progress at points, creating interesting 'how do we both progress' puzzles.* Looped falling can be surprisingly hilarious* You can 'bend the system' by attempting crazy mid-air combos, such as trying to jump off your partner as they loop-fall. This can sometimes provide alternative ways to solve puzzles, for players that enjoy precision-reflex approaches over puzzle approaches. But really, it'll take quite a few attempts to do- though it's quite satisfying when you manage it.* Charming atmosphere, and the most adorable little interactables- that you can actually push into enemies to cause the enemies to change course, or bounce onto enemy killing buttons, or just kick around like soccer balls, sometimes to absolutely hilarious effect. Great little tidbit for more creative puzzle solving, and just general palate cleansing.* The ability to aim for a perfect score, by gathering all the enemy-kill score drops, for the more dedicated completionists.||NEUTRAL||* Secret stages are brutal and difficult to intuit, and may be best skipped by all but the most dedicated mental gymnasts. * This game gets hard. It looks like it's designed for kids, but most kids won't have the patience to complete this kid of game [and if you know one that does, give them a cookie, they're awesome].  This is definitely a game for the patient and the people who really like working through problems until they understand them. If you're into really puzzle-oriented games, enjoy teamwork, and physics manipulation, you're going to probably like this game. If your expectations run toward something more- or less- active in involvement, you may not.* Similarly, puzzles will require several attempts to figure out, and at the time we played, all the walkthroughs were for the console version (which has different stages, see Cons below). Plus side, every time we got stuck and needed an assist, it was us overthinking a puzzle, so there's that. :) Still, patience is a virtue- and one you may need to rely on for this game.Then again, you'll still die less, hate yourself less, and feel far less frustrated than with twitch/reflex platformers, so there's that~* Relatively short. 6 to 7 hours without the last level (see Cons), but that's mostly due to repetition in figuring out each puzzle. The core content is probably 2-3 hours in length, assuming a run-through where you know what you're doing. (Secret levels will of course extend this time a bit further, if you choose to do them.)||CONS||* The last level is broken on the PC port- or rather, several levels got reimagined for the PC port (which is kinda cool) but the reimagining of the last level caused it to be incompletable (which is kinda not cool). The game plays fine up to that point, so if you're able to view the end of the game being a level sooner, you'll be fine- If you're a completionist, this screw-up may drive you up a wall.Especially with given how demanding the prior level was- you can only imagine how awesome this final level could have been..* No mid-level save points, so you're forced to complete a stage to make progression in it.[Each puzzle section within a stage does have its own respawn point, however.]Plus side, once you know the puzzles, you can breeze through if you need to leave and restart- still, this feels like an unfortunate and arbitrary exclusion.* Likewise, this game seems to have low replay value, given that non-campaign-level challenges (ie, secret levels) are all extreme in challenge, and all puzzles in the game are fairly easy to complete once you know how to do them.This is a bit of a difficult game to describe, but if you like undertaking a mental challenge with a partner, and neither of you are the type to get agitated when you get stuck, then it's a fantastic game I recommend highly.As always with co-operation games of this nature, if either person gets easily stressed, expect eventual argument and rage-quitting.Despite that phrasing, it's not an especially frustrating game (in MY opinion), since everything CAN be figured out through rethinking and continously retesting your approach to a puzzle.Still, it's a bit niche in its challenge, a bit curious in how certain things (like secret levels) are approached, and, of course, the last level cannot be played.So..I tentatively give it a 4/5. Seriously, if it sounds at all good to you, give it a shot- and if it sounds at all not good to you, don't. ~.^			",647,380,19,136,44,14,153

												I wrote a lengthy version on gamespot.com, with fancy images. ( http://www.gamespot.com/ibb-and-obb/user-reviews/2200-12659853/ )But to summarize,NEGATIVE POINTS- The controls are a bit cheap, lack the ability to move precisely, which is needed in many situations in the game.Little reason to actually collect the points, more frustration than reward.- Unclear whether the player is in the middle or near the end of the level.- One of the important mechanics blends in too well with the background, making it unclear.NEUTRAL POINTS- Level designing is fairly good but could be much better in some areas.POSITIVE POINTS- Mechanics and concept are neat.- Creating a 2player platform puzzler is not an easy job.- Aesthetics are fitting and look good.- Particle effect on the cursor aids gameplay really well.I'd say 12 bucks is too much for the frustration though, if they simply made it a shorter game (with the quality > quantity mindset), spent some more time on the movement, leveldesign and some clearer indications I think this game would be awesome, but for this, no. I wouldn't recommend it.			",131,5,1,10,9,1,12

												I want to love this game. It's cute, the controlls are tight. The puzzles ARE good. I want to reccomend this game...but I cant.There's a big brick wall of problems here and there. While the puzzles are designed well there are more than a few instances of mechanics placed around the puzzle as if to throw you off of the answer (mechanical level was a big one for us). There is also a DISTINCT lack of button use. Sure the game is jump and that's it, but we had to restart a handful of levels simply because there's no die option. If you get stuck, too bad, restart the whole level. There is a series of levels in the dark where your visibility is limited. We quit here, and are unsure if we will return, the design felt cheap at this point, with synthetic difficulty.			",225,30,5,17,10,0,9

												This game is a preview of Hell. I have never been so frustrated, so nuclear♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥within the first thirty minutes of playing a game in my life. To be fair, it isn't the game's fault, it is my own intellectual incompetence. This game makes me feel like a high-functioning retard. I'm not alone though, me and my co-op partner even looked up YouTube walkthroughs, and the people doing the walkthroughs got stuck and gave up. If you and a buddy profoundly despise yourselves, go ahead and give it a shot. Otherwise steer clear. It looks simple and easy....... it is neither.			",128,39,12,8,8,0,11

												I usually don't bother leaving games a review at all, let alone a negative one......and, it pains me to leave this game a negative review, because it aims to be something very rare (and something I much desire) in the video game marketplace: an age-neutral co-op game. All the other coop games on the marketplace are shooters with blood and guts and the disemboweled souls of little puppies flying everywhere. I was hoping that the game would be something fun to play with young folk. It was excellent until we reached the little black spikeballs of death that chase you. Despite all our combined inginuity and (not too terrible) platforming skills, we could not progress past a certain scene with spiky deathballs that chase you. Was there a difficulty setting we could turn down? Nope. Were there cheat codes we could use to experience the rest of the game? Nope. Could we just ""git gud""? I suppose,  but the goal wasn't to play an intense, twitch-based, control-heavy platformer.. it was to have fun with a friend, and also to solve some cool two-player puzzles (like the gameplay trailer shows.)The little black monster also neatly brought into focus the game's other failings: the controls are unpleaseantly slippery, which exascerbates the precision needed to engage the puzzles and platforming elements, especially perching on your friend's head. Perching on your friend's head is an element needed to solve many puzzles, but for such a pivotal gameplay element, it relatively difficult to achieve. We always needed two or three tries to accomplish something central.All-in-all, from what I've seen, the concept is good, and the art is fairly cool, and the mood is cheerful, but the execution was a fail, because the execution kept us from experiencing the rest of the game. I wish I could reccomend this--I really do.			",52,17,0,7,9,0,19

												This game is not so much a puzzle game as a vehicle for the torment and suffering of hell. I have sinned, I have truely sinned in my life I will admit. However I am quite certain that I have never done anything so horrible as to bring this level of frustration and anger upon myself. If you want to find something to do on a Friday night, I'd recommend that you bash yourself in the head with a hammer rather than play this game. To the rest of you however who happen to be masochist, enjoy the pain that is Ibb & Obb.The game certainly starts out easy enough and being about puzzles, but it quickly goes from simply figuring out puzzles to managing to pull it off. More places than not, I had long figured out the solution before managing to actually apply the hand to eye coordination necessary to proceed through the level. In many places there were challenges that involved precise timing to avoid enemies.The other thing to note however is that this game, I believe, is the only game from steam in which I’ve never gotten a single achievement on. This is of course referring only to games that actually have achievements, but out of the very limited number of them, I managed a grand total of zero. I don’t care though, because I would sooner walk over a field of broken glass then swim through a sea of lemon juice and salt than I would ever play this game again.Edit: I realized after I posted this review that I did in fact get one achievement which I forgot about. The only achievement I got was for completing the game, but I forgot I had gotten it during my mad rush to uninstall this blight from my hard drive. My bad...			",45,10,0,9,3,0,2

												It seems like a nice little game for when you have a friend over.  I really like how WASD is used for one character, and the directional buttons for the other.  This allows simultaneous local gameplay.I imagine the online gameplay would be fun...if other people ever joined online to play. :/The art is simple, but somewhat lacking.  I imagined this to be a visual wonder, but its setup is lacking and more simple than a Flash tutorial on how to animate.  I guess I expect a bit more.Overall I'll give this a 5/10.  Not recommended.			",10,2,0,4,2,0,0

												Tried hard to be modern and artsy, but the 'PhyreEngine' unfortunately does not provide magical tricks to remove online delay, hence this 2p-coop-only timing puzzle videogame falls flat as an online experience. From what other reviewers wrote, it doesn't even work properly via LAN.If it were couch coop only, I'd moan that there's no online MP, but as it stands, I have to moan that the online MP isn't very good. Later levels are just about impossible due to the atrocious lag / delay and random erratic AI behaviour resulting from this.I sure like the comparably cheap two pack offer, but the bugginess / glitchiness as well as frequent reliance more on perfect timing than clever thinking prevents me from giving this game a positive review. Unlike it apparently was the case for other reviewers, my 1.5 hours of playing time did not include 'lightbulb moments' where I was mesmerised by the developers' astonishingly intricate puzzle design. At all. As far as challenging players with pattern memorisation and perfect timing goes, there are various games on Steam that make far far better use of those gameplay elements (SMB, Rush Bros and I assume Electronic Super Joy as well as SpeedRunners).Give this game a look if you engage in regular single PC dual gamepad multiplayer games, or if you happen to have a lot of patience for a game's issues when it comes to playing online with a close friend.P.S.: Voice communication is a must for all but the first few puzzlies. Not gonna be any jolly if you can't communicate while you play.P.P.S.: When you're STUCK SOMEWHERE due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEVEL DESIGN, it's impossible to kill yourself to restart from the last automatic save point. Good job, developers.			",3358,1277,127,344,498,39,549

												A really good game, nice music, nice design, nice gameplay..i really enjoy it.The only problem i have is the lags i get when playing with my partner and they are pretty bad..which is why i'll have to give you this negative review sadly, since it's a great game if it wouldn't be lagging (and it's definitely not an internet connection issue).Since this game is supposed to be played in co-op i consider this a big problem, big enough to make my review negative. My partner is teleporting really badly and sometimes the crystals you have to collect are shown as collected for him but splitted on the ground for me, and in the end we didn't get all cause of that.I really hope you can fix that problem cause then this will definitely turn into a positive review.

												Ibb & Obb is fantastic. My playtime may be low at the time of the review, but thats because I also have it on PS3. Are you looking for a coop game to play with your roomate, girlfriend, brother, ect? This is it people!  Grab 2 xbox 360 controllers and play on the same screen, or 2 copies of the game to play online. (Voice chat might be needed). It is also worth noting how relaxing this game is. Death isn't a punishment, but more of a reminder that you should be working together. The soundtrack is also superb with just the right ammount of imersion. My brother and I have played this quite a bit. Can't wait to try it with my girlfriend. ~PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												This is a delightfully fun casual platformer. Think old-timey Super Mario meets Portal. The horizon mechanic where one or both players can occupy the upper or lower portions of the level is fun and adds a little bit of flavor to your standard platformer.It also implements a light level of physics as jumping through gateways retains momentum a la Portal. This becomes a pretty important mechanic later in the game.My only negative is that it is an extremely linear game. There is only one way to solve a level--period. Not exactly a huge ding, just noteworthy.			",99,4,0,4,11,0,8

												ibb & obb is freakin' cool. A co-op game at its core, this indie puzzle gem is a perfect thing to take when you wanna make friends with someone or reinforce your friendship with them. Get a double pack if you both don't have own a copy of the game yet, it's just a few euros above the individual game's price, but it's totally worth it. You're bound to have a great time, I'm tellin' you!The controls are nice and fluid, the graphics are cute and eye-relaxing. Many of the puzzles are challenging and require close cooperation from you to beat 'em and go through. Some of the puzzles may evn take half an hour or more of brainstorming, but you won't really find it as a drag thanks to the lovely, soothing sountrack. The gameplay may last 7 hours, but it'll take you much more if you're into getting a great score at every stage and the achievements are pretty hard to get.9/10, totally recommended!

												9/10First off, highly recommended you only buy this game if you are going to play with a buddy.Anybody who is looking for a co-op puzzle platformer is looking at the right game. The smooth, colorful environment fits the game very well, and the music has a very relaxing tone (most of the time).The only thing that is stopping me from giving this game a perfect score is that there is one particular puzzle that is great at first, but later gets used again annoyingly. If it wasn't for a particular puzzle, I could say each one is unique.WARNING FOR ACHIEVEMENT ENTHUSIASTS: You must have an Xbox 360 controller in order to obtain all achievements!

												Great game overall, it's an original idea for a co-op game, and it is really good at making you thinkPros:-Fun graphics. I really love the art style 10/10-Great transitions between levels, they're really smooth.-Very challenging gameplay. Seriously the first few levels are ""oh okay that's cool, I get it"" but as you progress, the leves turn into more like ""My patience is wearing thin. Help me figure this ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥out, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.""-Voice chat (also a con)Cons:-Wish there was a bit more instruction in the game. Yes the whole point is for you to figure it out; I'm not talking about that. I mean the level selection is a bit wishy-washy. Since there is very little text instruction it can be a bit difficult to figure you what level you are selecting-The voice that is..... okay. First I don't like the weird modulation/virtualization it does to your voice. It kinda makes it hard to understand and I know it is supposed to fit the theme of the game but it seems that if they left it unfiltered it would have been better. Also there seems to be a 3.5 second lag between when I say something and when the other person can hear it. This might be my ISP, but I'm not sure. Also, NO PUSH TO TALK! This sucks! If you enable voice chat, it's always on, and this sucks for me because I play in the living room where my whole obnoxious family is and I'm really self-conscious about my TV blaring on the other player's headphones.All in all, It's a great way to challenge your brain and have some fun with your friends8/10 would recommend.

												Charming little puzzle platformer for coop play. Ideal when sitting on a couch with a family member or a friend. Be warned, though, that it is not really ""casual"". It starts easy, but the later levels get quite difficult both in terms of the puzzles and in terms of the platforming sections. There are a few places in the game which require pixel-perfect precision (with your very pixel-imperfect input controls) and can get quite frustrating. I was very reminded of Super Meat Boy in these sections.One technical note, this game suffers from graphical glitches on certain platforms, at the very least Linux with opensource radeon drivers. These glitches make the game a bit uglier, but most importantly they obscure certain objects (like air bubbles) which are necessary to progress and can make the solution even more difficult or force you to look at the solution online.

												Casual coop adventure for 2 people.Players can be both local or online connected (steam friends). This game requires both of players to survive until the end. I can't leave my friend alone when I pass the obstacles or make my friend go first into the danger to die. Most of the gameplay is puzzles, in which I talk with another player about how to deal with tricks. Communication is a large part of what I enjoyed in this game, since some tricks are really difficult and we had to join forces. Nicely made coop gameplay, also it has such neat graphic as screenshots show. And.. if you want, this can be played alone with both hands.			",632,322,16,73,71,9,69

												Had a really nice time playing ibb & obb, some of the levels were really complicated and if I'm honest I cheated a little bit >-<. I must say that sometimes the connection difficulties were quite annoying (especially in the very end of the game) which made it almost unplayable without a good connection.			",66,3,0,6,1,0,2

												We have finished this game with a friend of mine, and had loads of fun.It's such a gorgeous game with a great, soothing soundtrack by Kettel.Pros:- Absolutely gorgeous.- Great soundtrack and sound FX.- Challenging, without being too frustrating. (There were times we sat for an hour to solve a particular puzzle though).- There isn't always just one way of getting past something (although there USUALLY is just one way).- The satisfaction you get after thinking up a way to get past a certain puzzle: ""HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY"".- I'd say, 6 to 9 hours of gameplay, depending on your time efficiency.Cons:- I don't see this game being any fun without a good friend that you enjoy just chatting with.- Seriously, don't buy this game if you don't have a good friend you can play it with.- In contrary to what I said earlier, in fact it can get a bit difficult at times. If you don't like chatting and brainstorming with the particular friend of yours, you will probably get frustrated and quit the game forever.- We've encountered some bugs along the way, but nothing too problematic.If you meet the aforementioned criteria, this game is for you. 8/10 ",119,20,1,13,9,0,7

												Do you like other people? Do you like video games? Do you wish you could merge your love of video games with your love for other humans? Never fear, this game is LITERALLY designed for that! Command one half of the keyboard each; one keyboard + one controller; or two controllers. Although there's going to be frustrating periods where you'll yell at each other for not following each other's hastily thought-out instructions.Graphics: 10/10. Colourful, great paralax background, so many ♥♥♥♥ing colours. Can your graphics card drive a monitor? Then you can play this game! I can even switch to my integrated graphics card to run this game at 1080p 60 FPS, which saves my laptop from heating up. Sound: 10/10. Every sound feels like it was lovingly-crafted, and it shows. The sound is complementary to the game, and it really sets the mood.Gameplay: 8.5/10. Gameplay is clear, consistent, and varied. Each level is unique, but not unique enough you'll get lost. New gameplay concepts are introduced very well on-the-fly. However, some challenges require a lot of out-of-the-box complex thinking, so you will get stuck for maybe 20-30 min on a particular section. Overall (not an average): 9/10. Buy this game on sale!

												An ok coop game. Simple artistic input with a pleasant color scheme and adorable characters. Good puzzles to keep you thinking more than 30 seconds and a cute soundtrack will give you this adorable platformer. The cons are that even the game has an online coop it acts like a local mode coop when camera moves towards teh person who moves and sometime it doesn't and this is annoying if you need to do some fast coop progress at the end levels. Some puzzles doesn't have an impressive design, are quirky and unintuitive; needs rethinking. Overall find a buddy or play it with yo gf you'll get your time well spent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game traumatised me. It looks innocent enough in the beginning. Two colourful friends jumping and moving around, trying to get to the end of the level.And then you get to the difficult parts. And you begin pulling your hair out trying to complete it. And then you tell yourself, it's going to be alright.....you can do this....just keep going.But it never gets any easier. The moment you reach the last puzzle of Level 13, you will begin to question your life choices and what made you decide to play this game.If you ever manage to get past Level 13, congratulations, you're one of the few skilled people who could.I managed to do it with a friend. I thought that the moment of victory was upon us. We could finally beat Level 13! And before the last orb even touched my character, the game crashed...along with my spirit.So yes, buy this game if you want to face the devil and try to beat him.The devil always wins...Always...

												Synchronization through vocal communication is important. The game provides no way to synchronize actions other than skill alone. It does not feature hand holding countdown timers through a button press nor gameplay elements favoring synchronization.The directional controls feel like there is something uncanny about the acceleration rate, inertia and friction.The above combined makes it so that several puzzle elements are frustrating because they are non deterministic. A slight variation in position or momentum will cause your character to move in various ways with a difficult to predict outcome, meaning that a puzzle section has to be attempted many many many times before any success, even if you already know how the puzzle is meant to be solved.Some puzzles will require one specific player to execute one specific part of a puzzle. There are sometimes an urge to swap roles which can't be done.It may be difficult to have two players stay engaged through the entire game. The overall longevity of the game is obfuscated because an entire chapter may have such frustrating puzzles we had to stop at the end of each chapter and resume days later.There is frustrating difficulty but it doesn't feel ""bad"", it feels like it was intended to be this way.

I can't count the time I've purposely killed my partner or screamed like a dying pig. (▰˘︹˘▰) It also tests over how WELL you know one another. This game is only beatable with good communication & synergy. Regardless, this is super fun and not very time consuming, so that is a plus! :) P.S. OBB (pink one) IS THE BEST!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful and fun co-op game.  The puzzles range from easy to difficult, and there's a bit of timing puzzles as well.  The game does a superb job of introducing new mechanics and reinforcing what you've learned later on.  The core mechanic - that of using gravity and portals - is delightful in itself to play around with, that makes figuring out even a difficult puzzle feel fun.Even my non-gamer friends love to play this when they're over, and I have a blast watching them try to figure it out.

												Overall, it was a really cool experience. The stylised art style and soundtrack really gave the game the sort of atmosphere it boasted. +1 Adorable art. You can't help but come to love those little... things... beings... blobs.... Actually I don't know what they even areThe dimension portals in this really reminded me of the puzzles in Portal. Gotta start playing more of these co-op puzzle games. The puzzles were easy enough. At first. And then it got a bit tough. Then quite tough. Then wtf you don't know how many times we had to die or restart or how long it took to solve just a small fraction of some levels. Or maybe you do if you've played the game. Or maybe you're a freaking genius and I hate you.I'm honestly really impressed with how tough the puzzles got even in a 2D world. I thought it took alot more than that to make it as enjoyable to solve as the original Portal, and I was sure I would just gloss over this puzzle platformer with ease, but they proved me wrong. I'm probably just not playing enough of these puzzle games. But then again at certain points of time it boiled down to just pure luck or 1337 skillz to solve some of these, and the rage was real. Still, I really appreciate it for how difficult it got. :DWhich reminds me, when playing ibb & obb in single player I kept screaming when either got killed because of the shock factor from not paying attention to one of the characters and then realising you're suddenly dead. Maybe humans truly aren't made to multitask after all. *watches solo playthroughs on YouTube* wtf is disBtw got this cheap from a bundle and was a bit worried about the heavy co-op aspect since none of my friends got the game. Then I realised the bundle included not 1 but 2 copies of the game! Can't go wrong with this. Then again, the Double Pack costs less than a fifth more of the original price on Steam so it'd be dumb not to get that and invite your friend to play (and hope he likes timing and skill-based platformers or he'll end up rage-quitting).Haven't finished the game and already writing a review... Well sorry I just really love this game.			",245,121,5,47,14,2,12

Obstructed by black blobs that prevents you from passing the linear world, you rely on varius elements on the world to proceed.There are many mechanics similar to portal that may inspire fans to play.Solving puzzels, relying on your partner, and befriending the little yellow buds you see in your travels will be more than any thing you may felt.Also, its great practice for controling your temper :)Don't blame anything too much and try to enjoy it!

												Ibb and ObbFun co-op platformer/puzzle game. Plays like chill version of Super Mario Bros with ""outside the box"" thinking puzzles that remind me of Portal 2 co-op. You play as a pair of brightly colored pac-man ghost looking guys that either walk on the top or the bottom of a side scrolling level. The top-bottom thing has reversed gravity and holes that allow you to fall from one side into the other. This makes for many ""flinging"" style puzzles that you use gravity to accelerate you into the flip side world. There are enemies that can only be defeated on a certain side, and the goodies that pop out on the opposite side must be collected by your co-op buddy. The game is full of ""aha!"" moments and working together makes for plenty of high fives. It supports both local or over the internet co-op. If you have a friend and like to use your brain, you should make some time to put both to good use and play this game.			",346,116,13,28,36,2,44

												This is a really wonderful, relaxing-yet-challenging game. My fiance and I are both gamers, but we wanted something we could play casually together, just the two of us, without getting super competitive. This little puzzle game requires that you work together, and it's really fun when the two of you finally solve a challenging puzzle. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a bit of work to play with a friend or s/o.I'm only about 2 hours in. So far, my only complaints are that the scoring system isn't self-explained, and I'm not sure what the replay value of the game will be. Although, I'm sure we'll find out. The soundtrack and the art are both very beautiful, and the game was well designed. I'd give the game an 8.5/10, and definitely say it's worth a shot.			",110,16,0,23,2,1,10

												Really fun two man puzzle game.  Not much else to say.  The puzzles themselves are pretty challenging but I actually found the platforming to be difficult as well.  On the secret levels you can figure out how to complete it and still end up spending 20 minutes just getting the perfect set of moves.  Definitely a good game.			",88,3,1,5,4,1,18

												I really liked this game. Clever platforming elements, excellent co-op mechanics, and the graphics are really cool. It has challenging difficulty, and if you're playing solo controlling both characters at the same time, it's really hardcore. I also love the music, it fits the game really well and creates an incredible soothing atmosphere.			",49,8,2,4,4,2,2

												A lot of fun. I'd highly recommend this game. It had us screaming at the screen.It is just as well that it has delightful visuals; it prevented us from smashing my desktop to tiny little pieces just long enough to complete most puzzles.			",94,31,1,5,14,0,6

												So, I forget where I first read about this game. Probably somewhere in the vijagame jouranlisms.  I really liked the visual aesthetic and the idea of a puzzle platformer built not just with co-op in mind, but built entirely around co-op as a necessary central mechanic.  I ended up playing the first level and a half solo just to get a feel for the game, and came away with the impression that it was going to be a cute, clever, but ultimately soft experience.That was quite some time ago.  Recently got into it seriously with a friend, and damn, my initial impression was proven wrong.  This game is certainly cute but it is anything but soft.  ibb & obb will challenge your brain meat.  The semi-hidden bonus stages especially; they gave us several excellent opporutnities to flex our brain muscle and were always very satisfying to solve.  Considering all your character can do is move and jump, it's amazing the depth of puzzles they're able to create with concepts like maintaining or building momentum or manipulating which direction gravity pulls your character.The only basic mechanic you have other than moving and jumping is a little colorful bubble trail thing you can create with either the mouse or the right stick, if you're using a controller.  It's the only communication tool you have in-game, and I was impressed with how much information we were able to convey to each other using this simple, visual medium.  Of course sometimes we had to open a chat window to talk deeper strategy, but still it's an elegant solution for the issue of communication between players that fits in with the game's minimalist approach to it's mechanics and aesthetic.I only have a couple negative points to share. The game starts out slow as you learn the mechanics and builds up the complexity on a pretty satisfying curve, but there are a couple challenges that boil down to basically challenges to your manual dexterity rather than your abilty to problem solve, and those are never as satsifying.  Secondly, we played online and towards the end experienced some pretty bad lag, which the game was not always good at mitigating.  We ended up with some weird lag artifacts like random enemies spawning in locations they shouldn't that only damaged one of the two players, or multiple copies of either ibb or obb respawning at once, or just really long wait times to respawn after death. Generally play was smooth and honestly you have to expect some problems when you play online over a crappy connection, but when the lag got particularly bad, the game had more trouble with it than I was expecting.It's a relatively short game but there's so few games out there that are anything like it, and those few hours are densely packed.  ibb & obb is pure gameplay; there's no text or any exposition of any kind anywhere in the game.  If you dig platformers and puzzlers and various combinations thereof, and you've got a friend with similar interests, there are certainly less engaging ways you could split $14.  love that the ""Best Friends Forevr"" double-pack only costs two dollars more than one copy on its own.  If you buy the two-pack and split the cost with a friend, you're both basically getting the game 40% off.  That's how strongly the developer believes in their vision of a 2-player co-op puzzle platformer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wasn't expecting too much of this game. Just a simple platformer for cooperative play and a bit of light fun.As it turns out some of the puzzles can be rather tricky to work out and require some teamwork and coordination. Not sure if it was due to networking issues, or a fault in the game, but trying to cope with a delay between the players just made it even more challenging. But also really rewarding when finally getting it right.Maybe the standard price is a bit on the steep price for such a simplistic game, but if you find someone also interested in puzzling platformers with a rather different art direction, this is a good game to check out for an hour or two's fun. Can't really speak to the length, as I have yet to complete it.			",564,127,21,71,33,6,90

												While this game does many things very well, there are a couple that really bothered me.ProsThe game has a very cute and minimalist aesthetic that I enjoyed.The puzzles have a pretty good difficulty curve, with progressively more challenging puzzles.I also liked how the game exhibited new mechanics. There are virtually no words throughout the game, and the game does a nice job of showing you how to do something before you do it (at least for the beginning puzzles).NeutralThe controls felt a bit off at first. The jump felt a little too floaty. But after about 10 minutes, it wasn't hard to adjust to it.ConsWhile I said that the difficulty curve is fine overall, much of the latter part relies too heavily on being able to precisely time and coordinate movements between your partner with little room for error. If you or your partner mess up, you'll have to retry.My main gripe however, which will probably sound pretty inconsequential, is the fact that the game doesn't exactly excel. The game does things well, but not really well enough to stand out. It makes nice use of it's gravity-changing doorways, so they don't feel tacked on, but unfortunately, there's not much else to set it apart, and with so many indie puzzle platformers, you really need to do so.

And I wasn't disappointed at all.It does however involve teamwork, and a smart brain since it does involve some thinking on your end and your partner's end! But I love it! No regrets purchasing it at all. You got to learn how to deal with gravity and etc too so.....keep in mind you might spend quite a few minutes like I have trying to figure out how to get through the levels. Would 10/10 tell people to get it! Enjoy it and try not to rush through levels!			",42,9,0,12,3,0,0

												Ibb & Obb is simply one of the best co-op puzzle platform game I've ever played. Do NOT play this game with your best friend or SO because you will come out with anger management issue at the end!! I can't count the time I've purposely killed my partner or screamed like a dying pig. (▰˘︹˘▰) It also tests over how WELL you know one another. This game is only beatable with good communication & synergy. Regardless, this is super fun and not very time consuming, so that is a plus! :) P.S. OBB (pink one) IS THE BEST!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful and fun co-op game.  The puzzles range from easy to difficult, and there's a bit of timing puzzles as well.  The game does a superb job of introducing new mechanics and reinforcing what you've learned later on.  The core mechanic - that of using gravity and portals - is delightful in itself to play around with, that makes figuring out even a difficult puzzle feel fun.Even my non-gamer friends love to play this when they're over, and I have a blast watching them try to figure it out.

												Ibb and ObbFun co-op platformer/puzzle game. Plays like chill version of Super Mario Bros with ""outside the box"" thinking puzzles that remind me of Portal 2 co-op. You play as a pair of brightly colored pac-man ghost looking guys that either walk on the top or the bottom of a side scrolling level. The top-bottom thing has reversed gravity and holes that allow you to fall from one side into the other. This makes for many ""flinging"" style puzzles that you use gravity to accelerate you into the flip side world. There are enemies that can only be defeated on a certain side, and the goodies that pop out on the opposite side must be collected by your co-op buddy. The game is full of ""aha!"" moments and working together makes for plenty of high fives. It supports both local or over the internet co-op. If you have a friend and like to use your brain, you should make some time to put both to good use and play this game.			",346,116,13,28,36,2,44

												Extremely good co-op puzzle platformer.  The mechanics are really well designed for co-op specifically.  This is NOT just another random platformer with co-op tacked on!  The music and visuals are also incredible.The only ""downside"" (if you think of it that way ) is that the game ramps up in difficulty pretty quickly.  There are a few places, especially the ""secret"" areas, where progressing requires BOTH of you to execute several actions in a row perfectly and in sync.  I don't really view this negatively, but there were a few frustrating areas.			",273,75,2,15,22,5,19

												A fun game to pick up and play with a friend or online. The soundtrack is amazingly relaxing and calm, one that won't wear out your patience if you're struggling on one of the obstacles. If anything, it probably helps with keeping you from getting frustrated. On that note, obstacles require creative ways to get around them, and playing in co-op really brings this out. The only downside I can see to this game is that there is no in-game way to communicate via text; players would have to communicate either through voice chat (in-game) or a Steam chat. Otherwise, this game is a really nice and enjoyable experience all around. All in all, it reminds me of Portal minus the frustration. Get it on sale, and you'll be a happy camper. 8/10			",92,26,1,5,8,0,2

												I had a lot of fun playing this with friends; it pretty much became a party game where everyone watched and cheered the two currently playing.It works in that you have a simple physics engine keeping the entire game together. What makes it difficult? The fact that teamwork is a must! Co-op games aren't usually this intensely reliant on how in sync - not just coordinated - you are with your partner! The art is charming, the music is fitting, and the whole premise is astounding. Rather difficult when playing with someone beside you, and dare I say practically impossible when playing without any way to speak or otherwise coordinate with your companion!I enjoyed this greatly and wholeheartedly recommend it.

												The concept may be pretty basic but they pull it off pretty nicely. The puzzles are designed for two people and they were fun and just challenging enough and overall me and my friend enjoyed playing it. Nothing we would play for a long period of time but it was pretty fun in short doses. And if the game works for you then you will probably have an alright time. However me and my friend experienced network issues all the time and it ruined the experience. Delay and stuff not spawning for both players are bad enough but we also experienced desynch issues which caused the game to be unplayable. Connection problems does also not mix well with checkpoints.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

I'd recommend this to maybe couples or good friends, but possibly not for children as it will get very challenging later on, but if you have kids and want to challenge them this will definitely be a good game for that goal.

A Challenging Co-op ExperienceIbb and Obb is a cooperative game meant to be played with a partner. It's a 2D platformer in which you have to complete puzzles together in order to progress. Each person plays as one of the titular characters, and your goal is to complete levels by helping each other get past obstacles through various means.The game design is simplistic, but elegant. The world is divided into two parts, above and below the ground, and gravity is inverted while you are below, meaning that you will ""fall"" upwards. The game is simple enough that the lack of a tutorial doesn't really matter; players can intuitively figure out how things work.My main gripe with this game is how hard it can be for someone who's not used to playing video games. Although the controls are easy enough for just about anyone to grasp, some of the puzzles can be extremely difficult to complete. My partner and I got stuck on an early level because one of the puzzles required her to complete a series of actions precisely, with very little time to spare. She couldn't do it, so I had to do that part for her in order to finish that level.Currently, we're at a point which requires too much coordination, and we both agreed that it would be next to impossible for us to get through together. Thus, we've simply stopped playing the game, which is sad, considering how much fun we've had playing so far, despite certain bouts of frustration.Another annoyance is that there is no in-game option to switch characters. Your character is determined based on whether you created or joined a game; if you start a game, you will play as Ibb, the green character, whereas if you are joining a game, you will play as Obb, the red one. I feel like the inability to switch characters is such a big oversight, because depending on which one you play, you will have different obstacles to overcome, and some of them are much more difficult, in my opinion.In summary, this is a fun little two-player game that is very easy to pick up. It's an especially great game for couples in long distance relationships, as you may sometimes find yourselves yelling at each other, which often leads to laughter. However, I would not recommend this game to those without any prior video game experience. Both players need to have good coordination together to be able to make it further into this game. Overall, this game can be challenging, but it is certainly enjoyable.			",83,6,5,6,14,0,5

												Great if you have someone on voice chat to play this with. Good thing it was cheap because after I finished it it's just sitting there on my library...Simple concept, and a 10 year old could probably have done the concept graphics, but it has a charm of its own.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a delightfully fun casual platformer. Think old-timey Super Mario meets Portal. The horizon mechanic where one or both players can occupy the upper or lower portions of the level is fun and adds a little bit of flavor to your standard platformer.It also implements a light level of physics as jumping through gateways retains momentum a la Portal. This becomes a pretty important mechanic later in the game.My only negative is that it is an extremely linear game. There is only one way to solve a level--period. Not exactly a huge ding, just noteworthy.			",99,4,0,4,11,0,8

												Very few games do co-op right. Some have little to no co-op interaction, and the players might as well be playing alone. Some have ""shared lives"" where the less experienced player feels like they're dragging down the team. Ibb & Obb has the best co-op mechanics of the many, many cooperative games I've played.Ibb & Obb is a puzzle platformer. Both players are needed to solve every puzzle, meaning a player is never left out or dragged behind. Sometimes the puzzles require that the players fill specific roles--Ibb. the green guy, is allowed through green portals and Obb, the red guy, is allowed through red portals. The developers cleverly alternate the use of these portals to ensure that no one player always takes the active role in each puzzle.My sole criticism is that Ibb & Obb doesn't have in-game communcation to match the intricacy of its puzzles. Players can only draw colored lines in the air, but they are fairly short and fade quickly. This problem disappears if you're playing couch co-op or are using a mic.The puzzles are excellent and make clever use of teamwork and physics.The graphics and visuals are very pleasing.The soundtrack is amazing and certainly worth owning as well.Ibb & Obb is among the best of the indie, co-op, puzzle-platform, and artsy genres. If you've got a co-op buddy, this game is definitely worth your time.			",526,192,10,64,44,4,102

												Casual coop adventure for 2 people.Players can be both local or online connected (steam friends). This game requires both of players to survive until the end. I can't leave my friend alone when I pass the obstacles or make my friend go first into the danger to die. Most of the gameplay is puzzles, in which I talk with another player about how to deal with tricks. Communication is a large part of what I enjoyed in this game, since some tricks are really difficult and we had to join forces. Nicely made coop gameplay, also it has such neat graphic as screenshots show. And.. if you want, this can be played alone with both hands.			",632,322,16,73,71,9,69

												Great coop platformer which provides for a bunch of funny, frustrating, rewarding moments with a friend.Controls are super responsive and puzzles are really nicely thought, making getting into the game a zero effort task.Although the pointers help communicating and synchronizing the moves with the other, voice chat is super recommended, not for coordination, but for sharing your laughs and victorious remarks, as well as the expletives when either of you repeat some actions for the 111th time and the other fails miserably that one time when you were about done with the current puzzle.10/10 would troll and be trolled by my buddy again.

												ibb & obb is a 2-player puzzle platformer best played on the couch with a steam controller.  Most levels are easy enough to beat but tricky enough to keep you interested.  There's almost no mechanical skill to the game; it's all about wrapping your head around simple puzzles based around the idea that gravity pulls you toward the centre (instead of the bottom) of the screen.If you want a fun co-op platformer, ibb & obb is the game.

												While this game does many things very well, there are a couple that really bothered me.ProsThe game has a very cute and minimalist aesthetic that I enjoyed.The puzzles have a pretty good difficulty curve, with progressively more challenging puzzles.I also liked how the game exhibited new mechanics. There are virtually no words throughout the game, and the game does a nice job of showing you how to do something before you do it (at least for the beginning puzzles).NeutralThe controls felt a bit off at first. The jump felt a little too floaty. But after about 10 minutes, it wasn't hard to adjust to it.ConsWhile I said that the difficulty curve is fine overall, much of the latter part relies too heavily on being able to precisely time and coordinate movements between your partner with little room for error. If you or your partner mess up, you'll have to retry.My main gripe however, which will probably sound pretty inconsequential, is the fact that the game doesn't exactly excel. The game does things well, but not really well enough to stand out. It makes nice use of it's gravity-changing doorways, so they don't feel tacked on, but unfortunately, there's not much else to set it apart, and with so many indie puzzle platformers, you really need to do so.

												Awesome co-op puzzle game to play with a friend. Vaugely reminds me of the first time I played portal 2. A little replayability because you must collect all the crystals, but you can beat the game fairly quickly. Puzzles vary and keep you thinking, some time based some placement based and sometimes you are just running for your life. I only wish the game was longer. The cute artstyle can attract the not so serious gamers, but the complexity of the puzzles can keep any puzzle enthusiast playing. Would highly recommend.			",43,15,3,0,11,1,4

												I rate Ibb and Obb 5/5. Sadly, I will probably never finish it as I know no one who is able to play this game adequately. It isn't that this platform puzzle-adventure game is difficult. It isn't very difficult. It's just that all of my friends are into playing other types of games apparently. They play RTS (real time strategy) and other things. Oh well but that's the way it goes. It can be hard to find someone who is as good as you are at a game and ALSO wants to play it with you at the same time that you do. As this game depends on cooperation (most of this game's puzzles require a high-degree of cooperation) you need to play this with someone who is as competent at the game as you are and despite how cute this game looks, there are some fairly mind-bending puzzles in this game, but that's also a good part of this game's charm.The music in this game is excellent. The sound is good and cute. The graphics are cute. The game runs really, really well. The controls are, if you are a platform gamer, intuitive. But you MUST find someone else who thinks the controls are intuitive as well. Your mother who only plays complex scrabble-type word games and who has never managed to win a super mario brothers game won't be good enough at this and so the game will be sort of frustrating. This really is one of those games, like the cooperative mode of portal 2, where you should ideally be playing with someone you know really well and who is at least as good at the game as you are.

												Ibb and Obb is a cute, and beautiful co-op puzzle platformer. While you can play on your own, I don't recommend it as many puzzles rely on execution with percision movement.The visuals of the game are stunning and every level has it's own unique feel to it. Complimenting the visuals beautifuly is the soundtrack which I do recommend you get with the game.The puzzles are about a medium difficulty in the main game but can range from medium to hard in the secret levels. Once again, though, most of these puzzles rely on percision movement to complete. Overall, the game is very accomidating towards the 100% crowd and I can find myself spending many hours with my friend doing a full 100% of the game. I recommend this game if you have a friend to play it with. Otherwise, maybe skip it for now or just let an extra copy sit in your inventory for a while.			",187,49,1,15,13,2,12

												Very nice, cute game. I used to play it with my boyfriend in the same room. This is the game, which let us spend some time together not only in shooter games, but try something different. We learn how to understand each other, how to not get crazy and angry about each other. We played it as long, as it was possible to actually go through the level. At some point we finaly started avoid to play, cause we saw it's impossible to go through that level. Anyways, my memories is very nice about it, and I would start again to play after a year from the first level again. Game was a gift, so in that case I have nothing to regret. If you already have it - please enjoy, as much, as possible. If you think about buying it - thing again, if you're obssesed with finishing the whole game. Negative reviews is kind a right about how hard is to control two people moves at the precision accuracy. Wouldn't buy it for 10 euros.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Co-Op puzzle games I think I've played in a long time. Many games have come out for two (or more) players to try to solve puzzles together, but fall into one of a few traps: -One player too easily can take over, directing the other player(s) to the solution or simply doing it all themself, while waiting for the others to catch up, or making the others feel the puzzle is being spoiled for them.-The game forces each player into a specialized role which means they each have a specific job to do, and whoever is better/faster at the game is left waiting for others to figure things out. (Which makes it feel like everyone is playing their own solo game together, but separately.)-The game tries to force individual problem solving by limiting or not giving any ways for the players to communicate.Ibb & Obb does a good job of not falling into any of these traps through thoughtful puzzles and unique style and gameplay.The gameplay and style are truly unique, both in terms of design and visuals/music. A very lovely game that is challenging without being too hard, and has plenty of content without being a grind nor too short.  ",96,23,1,6,6,2,8

												Making seemingly simple puzzles almost impossible due to overthinking is my new hobby. For added effort, I like to complete all the achievments, as the game can be completed with little effort otherwise. So go ahead and grab your favorite snacks and gaming buddy and head out into the mysterious nature of ibb & obb.			",482,143,11,52,62,7,80

												Very smart and cute, and the soundtrack isn't bad either, but don't be fooled. Behind the colorful, happy-go-lucky exterior of ibb and obb there lies an insanely difficult hellscape of puzzles, with timing, gravity, enemies, and worst of all, reliance on teamwork blocking your way to success and happiness. I beat this, somehow, before playing Portal 2 for the first time, and this made that game look like a complete cakewalk. This is no joke. I do not think I could beat this game again if I tried.

												Yo for real I loved this game and played for a LOT of levels with some different buddies. It is a ton of fun for the first handful of levels but after the puzzles get progressively harder they introduce something so insane. They make everything pitch black and only the player can shed light. So like dude.. it makes some of these levels legitimately impossible if you're not willing to spend like 10 minutes per puzzle. But i recommend it because its fun and I cant really give it a negative review for being too hard. Good job developers! such a sick concept until the darkness grips the heart of these two characters.			",49,17,0,1,5,1,1

												I really wasn't expecting too much of this game. Just a simple platformer for cooperative play and a bit of light fun.As it turns out some of the puzzles can be rather tricky to work out and require some teamwork and coordination. Not sure if it was due to networking issues, or a fault in the game, but trying to cope with a delay between the players just made it even more challenging. But also really rewarding when finally getting it right.Maybe the standard price is a bit on the steep price for such a simplistic game, but if you find someone also interested in puzzling platformers with a rather different art direction, this is a good game to check out for an hour or two's fun. Can't really speak to the length, as I have yet to complete it.			",564,127,21,71,33,6,90

												This is a beautiful, well-crafted game.The controls and game-mechanics are introduced organically through gameplay, without so much as a word of instruction, which is definitely no easy feat and probably the thing I think is most amazing about this game.The puzzles are sufficiently difficult that when you finally get that light-bulb moment, the rush cannot be topped, but equally they're not unfair or excessively punishing.The music, sound design and art style are minimalistic and stylish, but neverthless manage to convey a lot of emotion about how you should feel in a given level.Working together with your friend to solve the puzzles often involves ""signing"" - when you move your mouse it draws a line in your character's colour across the screen where the cursor is, that the other player can see. This is a simple yet powerful system for letting your partner know what you're thinking and what you'd like them to do. However, sometimes its just a tiny bit too simplistic and a built-in text or voice chat would have been nice, even if its only used occassionally to express the more complex plans.If I had to name a bad point, its that the game is essentially multiplayer-only. It is possible to play the game on your own, by controlling both ibb & obb yourself, but this quickly becomes an impossible multitasking demand. Its an unfair gripe though, because the game's whole point is about working together with a friend to solve the puzzles: don't buy if you don't have a friend to play with, otherwise, I can't recommend this game enough.

												This game traumatised me. It looks innocent enough in the beginning. Two colourful friends jumping and moving around, trying to get to the end of the level.And then you get to the difficult parts. And you begin pulling your hair out trying to complete it. And then you tell yourself, it's going to be alright.....you can do this....just keep going.But it never gets any easier. The moment you reach the last puzzle of Level 13, you will begin to question your life choices and what made you decide to play this game.If you ever manage to get past Level 13, congratulations, you're one of the few skilled people who could.I managed to do it with a friend. I thought that the moment of victory was upon us. We could finally beat Level 13! And before the last orb even touched my character, the game crashed...along with my spirit.So yes, buy this game if you want to face the devil and try to beat him.The devil always wins...Always...
