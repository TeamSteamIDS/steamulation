												I had so much fun with this game! I recommend this for Harry Potter fans only - as you won't understand what's happening if you haven't read the books and seen the movies. The puzzles can get tricky. I got badly stuck quite a few times, but my solution was always the same - destroy EVERYTHING. Maybe this is common idea with LEGO games? I'm not sure, because this is my first. Either way, I immensely enjoyed the artistic style of the world, the somewhat open-world layout, and the hilarious LEGO retelling of the stories. If we had stars to give, I'd give it 5.			",50,16,0,11,3,0,1

												Played Lego HP 1-4, and now finished the story here.The game really improves on year 1-4. Everything is better now. From more special abilities, to better menus.After finishing the story, you have to re-visit everything with new characters to find all the hidden stuff!I really wish more games could be like Lego games.Marvelous gameplay, charming graphics, excellent attention to details... Simply PERFECT!11/10			",16,5,0,5,2,0,6

												For those who've played the Lego games, you will understand how to play. It is a bit of a challenge for kids to figure out as it's a problem solving kind of game. I love the uniqueness of the story lines in the Harry Potter series, as they try to not mimic the movies entirely, but create a totally new experience other than the basic plot. I reccommend for older kids and adult fans.			",67,30,14,8,7,1,10

												The second in the Lego harry potter series of game, encompasing the final films.One of the major things that differs from the first game is the graphics. Both the lego and normal 3D environments have a much higher resolutiion and quality, in addition to the ""magic"" effect graphics. This coupled with some new gameplay challenges, like duelling, add lots more variety to this game.Again, there is no voicing in this game, but it does expand the soundtrack to include music from the later films.Another change worthy of note is that this game does not crash intermittently like the first lego hp game. It does however suffer from end-of-level saves only, which means that if the game bugs out somewhere [which it occasionally does] you'll have to restart the entire level.If you played and liked the original HP lego game, then you'll definitely enjoy this one.

												Fun and full of secrets. I loved the humor and the LARGE world I could explore. It takes me a very long time to find all the secrets.With a game this big though, it is not surprising there are a few glitches. One that I experienced was where I used the map to become Ginny and the gang, but when I entered the hallway where you see all the houses' dormitories, I couldn't leave unless I went to Diagon Alley. It was a way around it, but only JUST.For the record, if you experience any kind of glitch where you can't leave a room without the game shutting down, go to Diagon Alley.All in all, a great game, lots a secrets, a few glitches. 9/10			",15,4,0,1,1,0,2

LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 (Action-adventure)Notes: Controller highly recommended! Ginormous snake warning!I'll skip the usual options and general gameplay description since I covered it all in my review of the first Lego HP game HERE.  There are a few changes to the core of the game besides the expected changes in scenery.First off, the graphics are more complex than in the first installment.  The changes help to illustrate the growth of the characters, both in physical age and in maturity.  Those familiar with the HP series of books/movies know that eventually we move away from Hogwarts and into entirely new areas.  LEGO HP handles these new areas very nicely, and they manage to tie everything together in a way that feels both isolated and connected at the same time. We have some new spells this time around, but the irritation of missing things if you don't have Wingardium Leviosa (levitation) selected is gone.  This time around anything that needs WL to interact with will have a pink aura around it, whether you have the spell selected or not.The key bindings are slightly different than in the first game, due to the needed addition of...Dueling!A lot of your boss fights are going to feature dueling, at least in part.  For easily-won battles, enter the dueling circle, throw up a shield, match the (spell) color of your side of the circle to theirs, then just do whatever the screen tells you to do.Like the first game, each Year consists of one six-episode chapter, with the exception of Year 7, which spans two chapters (12 episodes), for a total of 24 story-based levels.Collectibles:- 200 Gold Bricks- 20 Red Bricks (to unlock extra abilities - be sure that you remember to turn them on each time you play!)- 60 Students in Peril- 24 Hogwarts crests (four pieces each)- 24 True Wizard achievements- 19 Spells to purchase at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes- 112 base characters, most of which have multiple outfits to unlock, for a grand total of 200 Character Tokens to findI have mixed feelings about this installment.  The interface is improved, and the gameplay more complex and interesting, so those are definite pluses. While the graphics are better for this game, I kind of miss the simpler graphics from Years 1-4, hence the mixed feelings.Overall, I truly enjoyed my second foray into the world of LEGO Harry Poter, and THIS time I managed to 100% it ;D  Absolutely recommended.

												First of all, I love both LEGO and most TT games (especially the STAR WARS games) and I grew up with Harry Potter.Storywise, there is some really good, typical, visual humor and the Story is of course amazing, if you enjoy Harry Potter.The big deal with this game is however, that the raw gameplay is fantastic. Of course, you have to own a controller, because the game is, in my opinion, unplayable without one. But if you`ve got that figured out, there is nothing between you and an amazing game.It brings together two of my favourite game genres, Open World Exploration and ""Collect `em all"" type games, similar to most other LEGO games. However, the levels are enjoyable, the cutscenes wonderful and TT manages to get me through Sirius`s death scene without crying, so that is definitly an accomplishment on their part!I have 100% this game twice(if you are stuck somewhere, feel free to add me ;) ) and I can still lean back and have a good time. Of course, LEGO games have always been family oriented, but if you pick up a friend that enjoys Harry Potter too, you can have a great time no matter your age.Finally, I`d like to add, that this is a very relaxing game to play, even if you aren`t a Harry Potter fan, and who knows, maybe you`ll even read the books or watch the movies after the game caught your eye. Have a wonderful time playing, if you are on this page already, you might aswell buy it (IF YOU HAVE A CONTROLLER!) :)			",78,5,0,6,5,0,7

Jokes aside, I really enjoyed the game.  The keyboard configuration is a tad awkward, so I found this configuation to be more helpful: K - Tag; E - Special; R - Action; Space - Jump; 1 and 2 - Spell Switching			",35,37,0,8,5,0,1

												I was a definite lover of the first Lego HP game on the DS, so I was really excited to buy this one for the PC. And I'm so glad I did! It's hilarious and great fun to play in a casual fashion - although I will say you do definitely need to know the Harry Potter story anyway, as the cinematics contain only grunts and nudges in the traditional Lego game style.But all in all, this game is fantastic fun and is absolutely hilarious - no less than I expected!

												Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7 was the first thing I installed after playing through the first one (1-4). I wanted  to see how the story would continue, and since this game came out years after the first one, I expected graphical improvements and other nice features. I though this was gonna be another funny game to play. I think that's actually correct, but performance keeps me off this game.Funny thing is, for a lot of players with low-end graphics card this game runs good. For me, using a Nvidia gtx 980 however, game does not. I played for a few hours, really tried to like this game, but when framerate dips between 60 and down to below 10, it's really hard to do so. Normally I would just wait to write a review until the problem is fixed, but since this game was released in 2012, I don't think they will ever update it properly. It's sad to see, since the graphical improvements over the first game is great and everything about the dark and gritty wizard world is also nice. There is a lack of harry potter games available, so it's sad when the ones available aren't great either. It's even worse when the game has potential, but it dragged down by poor performance. It's a little wierd too, because the first one (released in 2008) runs great on new high-end graphics card.I got dizzy playing this game so I had to quit it, which sucks, since I really like both LEGO and Harry Potter franchise. I wanna recommend this game, but I really can't do that, unless you are running an old machine or if you have an xbox 360 to play it on.			",1471,589,50,140,180,18,243

												Harry Potter's innocent days are over. The boarding school antics have trickled to a halt, classrooms have gone silent, and even Quidditch matches--once the mark of happier times--have fallen by the wayside. In their place, a much darker picture has taken shape, marked by the ever-increasing fear of death. As far as stories go, it's not exactly a walk in the park, but it's nothing that a good Lego sense of humour can't handle.Like its predecessor, Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 excels at finding the true heart of the story it is trying to tell, layering this otherwise bleak premise with its own particular brand of cheekiness without sacrificing the essence of J.K. Rowling's world. This is a fun, richly detailed game that rewards curiosity and offers plenty of gameplay variety, making it well worth the effort for Lego and Harry Potter fans alike.Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 weaves together events from the final three Harry Potter books and the final four films. Despite the necessary liberties taken to mesh three narratives into one, the game manages to employ a multifaceted structure that is easy to navigate: each of the four chapters of the game is divided into smaller subchapters, each comprising a new part of the story. While the Vita version is a slightly simplified version of the console game (for example, cutscenes sometimes replace extended gameplay sequences, and some activities are different), it loses none of the charm.The gameplay is consistent with past Lego games: each short level requires you to complete a series of puzzle-solving tasks using a range of character abilities while knocking down and rebuilding large parts of the environment. There are also myriad side missions, quests, and collectibles. While the game's story moves along with effortless charm, it's the collectible element that adds both variety and replay value.There's a certain kind of addictive satisfaction that comes with collecting absolutely everything, and the game rewards this interactivity in a multitude of ways: 200 gold bricks, 24 school emblems, 20 cheats, and the fulfilment of becoming a ""True Wizard"" stud collector. It's also smart about the way it does this: only a proper playthrough unlocks all the characters and their respective abilities, and given that a lot of the game's environments feature areas and puzzles that are not immediately accessible, this adds a good incentive for a later reexamination.The Vita version of the game employs a number of touch-screen controls, which work well for some activities and not so well for others. For example, throughout the game you have access to eight spells, acquired in stages and presented in a spell-wheel system that can be cycled through on the fly, using either the right or left bumper or the touch screen. The game has made things a lot easier by eliminating the need for a lock-on mechanism, meaning you can shoot spells out of your wand to your heart's content or use the crosshairs when there is something specific you want to target. Casting spells with the button controls is simple enough: use the square button and the thumbstick to target and fire.You're also supposed to be able to charge and aim spells using the touch screen, but this never works as well as the button layout--the touch screen very often does not recognise where you want to aim the spell, and your character ends up shooting randomly. It's much simpler--and quicker--to use the buttons. The touch screen does come in handy during duelling, however, where you can block spells by simply swiping left or right. You can also use the touch screen to select highlighted objects that can be magicked by holding your finger on the object and then making a rotating motion, which activates the spell; again, this usually proves simpler and quicker with the buttons.The addition of Weasley Boxes in the game goes towards helping make the experience feel new; the boxes themselves--which contain numerous joke products providing special abilities for the surrounding puzzles--can be accessed only by members of the Weasley family, making red-haired companions a must in the free-play levels and providing you with an incentive to switch between characters more often. There are also Luna Lovegood's Spectre Specs, which let you see and build with invisible Lego bricks.As in other Lego games, there are certain exemplary moments full of well-dressed charm: Dumbledore's botched escape from his office in Order of the Phoenix, Harry's awkward romantic entanglements in Half-Blood Prince, and Snape's grisly death at the hand of Voldemort for the horrendous crime of eating all the muffins. This well-maintained lighthearted tone--a hallmark of all Lego games--is possible here due in large part to the attention to detail paid in the game's design.The game's environments are well detailed and contextually accurate, providing a rich backdrop for the action. The cutscenes re-create some of the film series' most inspired moments; the opening scene of Half-Blood Prince is a particularly fine example of this. They succeed in doing justice to the story's darker tone through the expertly crafted flashback sequences which are presented in a striking, sepia-toned aesthetic that reflects the maturity of the source material.But it's not all smooth sailing. The loading times can be a bit of a bore, especially since the game requires a substantial amount of time to load even when you're walking in between rooms and scenes. There's also a slight inconsistency with some of the game's smaller tasks, which are inserted at various moments throughout the story but have little bearing on what's happening. This is irksome only during the particularly high-tension moments, some of which are peppered with a number of bafflingly mundane activities, like building a cart or collecting ingredients for a potion. Thankfully, these moments are infrequent.For those who aren't ready to say good-bye to Harry Potter just yet, Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 is a charming way to stay inside J.K. Rowling's magical world a little bit longer. Despite the occasional slipup, the game successfully builds on the original story to offer a simple yet satisfying experience that has depth and replay value. There's enough to engage and have fun with to appeal to fans of Harry Potter as well as fans of previous Lego games.			",77,3,3,9,3,1,1

												Well, I'm a huge fan of LEGO games: LEGO Hobbit, Marvel, The Movie, Star Wars: The Complete Saga and ( of course ) this game itself are all in my Steam library and this has been just as good as the others ( better, in some cases ). This game summed up a journey I had been on since I played LEGO Harry Potter Years 1-4 years ago in 2010 on my Nintendo Wii and I must say that this has been a great way to finally finish the adventure five years later! Plot:The game goes through the last 3 Harry Potter books and the last four films. You get to play through 24 levels of magical mayhem, each story consisting of six levels a lesson or two and some free roaming in the open world. Fans of HP and his amazing adventures will be enthralled to see LEGO's comedic twists on the story and to discover references to both the books and the films, from obvious ones like locations and characters, to tiny ones like the objects characters will sometimes hold for a few seconds if you watch them closely ( e.g every minute or so Neville Longbottom will get out a plant, stroke it for a few seconds and then put it away, this is a reference to the Mimbulus Mimbletonia he owns in the Order Of The Pheonix book. Gameplay:There is lots of magical gameplay to experience and 7 spells to unlock: Wingardium LeviosaLumosDiffindoAquamenti ( yes I looked it up )Focus ( The spell Snape uses to get inside Harry's mind in Order of the Pheonix )Expecto PatronumReductoThese spells allow characters to break special objects, levitate things, spray water, create objects out of red brick, light up areas and defeat all sorts of magical beings. There is also a brilliant feature where instead of an 8th spell, you get a special pet, animagus, or just object that that character possesses (e.g. Harry has his Invis Cloak, Hermione has Crookshanks the cat and Remus Lupin has the power to turn into a werewolf ). Another good feature to note is the fact that 5-7 has added duels. This allows you to fight against many characters by using spells you have collected. You must use these to shield yourself, or try to defeat your opponent. These duels are a key part of the 5-7 levels, so you'll have lots of time to prepare yourself for the grand finale: Harry vs Voldermort in Deathly Hallows pt. 2. Between levels you will be able to explore one, two or all three of the main hubs. The main hubs are as follows:Hogwarts CastleLondonA small part of the countryside, used to represent Harry, Ron and Hermione's trek in Deathly Hallows Part 1Each hub has lots to do and extras to collect, for instance, London does not only include the Muggle part, but also The Leaky Cauldron and both Diagon and Knockturn alley. The free roam world does alter depending on which of the four stories you are currently playing in:Order Of The Pheonix is a sunny, safe environment with racy, peaceful and happy music.Half Blood Prince has a darker environment and Death Eaters can attack you at moments in both the alleys and The Leaky Cauldron. It also has a slightly sadder tune in the background.Deathly Hallows Part 1 has a rainy and very dark environment with lots of common Death Eater attacks in both the Muggle and Wizarding parts of London. Hogwarts is only able to explore via the Marauder's map and you have to play as Neville, Ginny or Seamus.Deathly Hallows Part 2 has a dangerous environment before you defeat Voldermort, where Death Eaters attack in London, both the alleys and even Hogwarts. After you defeat Voldermort, the open world becomes safe and sunny with slightly sad music in the background.			",17,12,0,2,3,0,2

ALERT: I am a really big Potterhead!!! :-)As I've told in the review of LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 I am a big fantasy fan, and Harry Potter is my all time favouritest.I have read all the books multiple times, and watched the movies again and again. For me, Harry Potter is just a special story, I really am addicted on it.To be honest, I really respect J.K.Rowling and all the actors, and other people who worked on this piece of art. Of course I like Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint,Emma Watson,Bonnie Wright and Alan Rickman the most, but there is not a actor which I do not like.I am going to pretty much write a simmilar review as I did for LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, cuz again this is something special for me.Exploring HogwartsTo be honest I am a little bit sad, because I think that the castle is a little bit smaller. But it doesn't matter, because of the other places you can visit(Tent area). Also a great thing is, that the castle has changed a bit and there are a bunch of new areas and I really like that. After all, Hogwarts are still beautifully made.Prettily made levelsThe levels are really great and I enjoyed them. But the part in The Horcrux and The Hand where a huge amount of Inferi attacks you on the island, was a little bit harder for me. They always stopped me from drinking the potion. After all, all the levels follow the story as told in the movies, and they are great! There is also a lot of collectibles you can find and that is the best thing in Lego games for me.Tons of playable charactersThere is really a lot of characters in this game and even that some are same, just with different clothes, the quantity of them is really big. As I told in the review of the previous part, my favourite ones are Ginny Weasley,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. As for the dark mages, I always choose Severus Snape.Perfect cutcenesEven that I haven't included this in the review of the previous part, the cutcenes are great. They look pretty much same as in the movies and I really love them. They are funny and fit the game perfectly. And the humor in them is also well done, for example Professor Slughorn refusing to give Ron a invitation for his Christmas Party.Final verdictThis game is really well made and I really enjoy it. I plan to finish it multiple times, because I can not get bored of anything connected with the world of Harry Potter and his friends. Again awesome work from Warner Bros and Travellers Tales!10/10 ",19,2,0,1,5,0,5

												If you enjoyed LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, or any other LEGO game, then you will enjoy this game.As the title suggests, it continues the story from the first game and follows that games template closely. The basic format of the game - with the 6 levels for each film, exploring Hogwarts and the other areas and then all the collectibles - is the same as the Years 1-4. However, to keep things fresh there are new areas that have opened up, new spells and new abilities to try.Much like the last game, and any LEGO game, the levels will all need replaying to get all collectibles - but this shouldn't be a surprise to fans of the series. But with the various characters to try and new things to unlock if keeps things interesting.As for performance, I realize a number of people report lag problems for this game. I can only speak of my experience and I had no issues. Either the problems are fixed or I was just lucky.Regardless, after my experiences with this game I would easily recommend it.

												I love lego games and I'm a suepr harry potter fan. So this game wasn't too bad! Pros:+so many awesome characters +new spells+just harry potter and legosNeg:- they changed the way you cycle through spells from 1-4- Diagonally is changed dramatically - The joke shop is a joke in and of itself-the cycle through function of the character is a joke since it is side scrolling They honestly changed a ton of workable things from years 1-4 in this one and just make it far more annoying to try to play but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. I do strongly wish they kept the features the same way from the first game.			",26,23,0,6,5,0,3

												Note: This review is for both Years 1-4 and Years 5-7 of LEGO Harry Potter, since they're basically two halves of one gigantic LEGO videogame.This is yet another LEGO videogame, and everything that you expect from these games is present here: easy to play with exploration, light puzzles, and simple combat. The setting this time is the magic world of Harry Potter, and TT games did an amazing job at recreating that atmosphere with LEGO bricks. Each game covers 4 movies, and one of the best features is that you can freely explore Hogwarts and other locations, connecting the 24 missions that each game has. You'll also learn and use spells, but for me they were generic. The cutscenes are well done and there's a lot of comedic value. Replayability is also high. In the end, they're two good LEGO videogames that you should get if you like the LEGO videogames and/or Harry Potter movies.			",267,164,6,31,13,4,38

												This game completes the LEGO rendering of the Harry Potter stories. I still haven't the foggiest idea what was going on as the game does not have any dialogue in it at all. Despite that I enjoyed this game. Just like the previous game it is done with a lot of humour and there are fun things to interact with throughout the levels. My graphics card struggled a bit when in split screen mode and turning the graphics settings down didn't seem to make any difference either to the performance or to the appearance. If you have played the first game you will want to play this one as well. I enjoyed this so much I am going to go and watch the films to find out what was going on.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												It's okay for Harry Potter fans. In my opinion it's better for younger gamers, than adults who wanna return to early HP world. If you're new to LEGO games, you either get drowned and fascinated in it or get bored easily. It's that type of game, where you collect coins and get precetnage of your entire game. I've never been into that type of games, because I find them easily boring or annoying at some point, but it was quite enjoyable when I played it with somebody else. I don't like doing 100% of game, if I don't truly fall in love with it, especially when it says 99,9% done - it's just too much work with so little tasks. If you're like me, you'll probably go through this game with no ""oh wow"" or give up after a few chapters. I prefer way way better the original Harry Potter games, but that's just me, I'm not so much into LEGO games.			",28,5,1,11,7,0,3

												It’s fun if you are into this niche.Story:It’s Harry Potter. Pretty much. The movies not the books.Like the first game, it roughly follows the story and tries to recreate it. Some sections are stretched for the sake of length which makes sense. The trouble with the later games is that there is a lot of stuff happening that's hard to convey via lego storytelling. For example, the last year doesn’t even mention anything to do with Grindelwald but does recreate an abstract version of the the Tale of the Three Brothers.This brings up a nitpick where the tone of the movies really isn’t matched. The later movies are depressing as♥♥♥♥♥♥with a lot of deaths but the games don’t address that. Every death is made funny in some way as to be not too depressing. You might say it’s made for kids but which kid is going to understand the revelation of snape being the half blood prince through grunts or a visual representation of the concept of happiness beating evil because he isn’t alone? You have to read the books to understand the plot at all and no one talks so it seems weird that they toned things down. Gameplay:If you’ve ever seen a lego game, it’s another one. You walk around, collect studs, do minor puzzles, and collect a million other things. The game feels more polished than the first but after finishing both, I can’t tell what exactly changed (they’re that similar). If you played the first one, you know what this is like. The only addition is that there are more character specific abilities now, more environments other than Hogwarts, and you loose some spells for other ones. Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)It looks better than the first one for sure with a lot more details. It’s not great looking like the Lego Movie game was but it’s good enough. The frame rate is usually at 144Hz but it stutters a lot (down to 30) when you’re going from area to area especially to hogwarts. It’s super annoying when you have to go from one place to another and it takes forever.Final Thoughts:Like the first game, it’s a Lego game. They’re pretty similar. This one can’t make up it’s mind about whether or not it’s a kids game or made for adults but that was part of the first one. Overall, I thought it was not bad. Try it out on sale and see if you like the gameplay. Can get slow at times but it has its charm. UNLESS YOU GO FOR THE 100%. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT♥♥♥♥♥			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												This is an awesome game. It was fun and stuck well with the films. It was a bit of a pain that you had to relearn all the spells from LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, leaving your character with next to no magic for the first year of the game... but I suppose if you look at it in a certain way that could have made sense, though it affects the flow form the first LEGO Harry Potter game to this one. But overall it is a really good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an astoundingly good game.  If you enjoyed the books and/or movies, you'll love the Lego counterparts.  It must be a great honor to have Traveler's Tales cover your franchise, because they treat each one they do with loving care.  The Harry Potter games are especially easy to recommend, though, because it plays more like an adventure game than an action game.  I did have a strange performance issue that prevented me from enjoying the game until I updated my graphics drivers, but other than that and a few additional very minor complaints I absolutely adore this game.

												It's alright. Haveing played 1-4 as well it was mostly just more of the same. Maybe i just got old but i found the game quite tedious. It's easy to play through, puzzles weren't too difficult, but once you done and can go back and unlock characters and do all the stuff to get 100% it's just tedious work that i had no interesting in doing. To me, it seemed like the storyline was really short and the rest of the game was just tedious work to unlock characters and such. That's why i played through once and haven't went back.

												Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 is yet another licensed Lego game and a sequel to Years 1-4. As you can masterfully detuct, it's based on the movies of the last three years of Harry Potter. And yes, the last one is divided into two parts in the game too. Developed by Traveller's Tales and released in 2011. Nope, no talking yet. Nope, still never-ever online multiplayer.It also was released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, NDS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, iOS. From the main consoles you can guess that Wii has the worse graphics. However PC doesn't come as the best, as it's not optimised and they don't sell DLC for it like for consoles: DLC pack of 10 characters and DLC pack of 5 silly magic to shoot at honest people. It doesn't sound important though.NDS, 3DS, PSP, Vita and iOS are also interesting to mention. As usual, Traveller's Tales can't decide what kind of Lego game to make for portable systems. Years 1-4 had some kind of isometric fetch quest with characters telling you things in dialog box. Years 5-7 seems to be made from scratch and made itself to be like a cutted down version of main game, while occasionally doing unique things. Single-player, yea. It is however nasty that PS Vita was forced to have as much of content as Nintendo DS, despite being much more powerful.Technically, PC version comes with bunch of problems.First of all, it's not optimized. Many people reported to have low framerates. Some have it only at start of levels, others have it constantly. Be ready that you may not run it smoothly.And another one is control mapping. The game doesn't remember them and you will have to rebind buttons on each game's launch. I also had a minor glitch where when I chose USB controller the game would show me square characters instead of words like ""button"" or ""axis"".At least it doesn't freeze or lose save or make progress impossible like Years 1-4 for some people.Gameplay-wise, yea, it's another Lego game. Casual, can't die, collect-a-thon. That was before characters talked. It still has a hub world of Hogwards and some story missions take place in it instead of separate levels. Mostly for classes. And yes, it's a direct sequel to Years 1-4. It added this fancy magic duel where you just have to attack with same-colored magic as opponent and then button mash to do damage. Though, I must say that magic selection this time around is more fun due to being more varied. They require doing a bit more thing then just moving target over things as game automatically chooses magic for you. Like, there is water-shooting magic.However, this is the one early Lego game that I beat on a single breath, so to say! I liked Harry Potter books a lot and read them all but I didn't remember books 5-7 much at all. As a result, game acted as refresher. As said, characters don't talk, so new people will not understand much and will not find it fun. But oh boy, I had a lot of it, remembering all the plot twists, reminding myself which one belonged to what year and laughing out at all the Lego jokes. It also wasn't complete comedy as there was a bit of drama, mostly thanks to that awesome soundtrack, so it was quite an experience to me personally.But then, I am not sure if it's because the game being objectively better than previous Lego ones or my personal bias in this case. Probably the latter.And hey, it has a level without wand and a 2D-like fancy-pantsy-artsy stage as well.Also can be noted is that this LEGO game pushed graphics up, using by-modern technical standards. Mostly you will see how shadows look awesome on all those lego details. High-quality and clear and superb lighting. Shame about not-so-awesome optimisation though.Also, yes, gamepad is recommended.And yes, I still feel that game mixes battle and puzzles nicely. Most often it's puzzle-only, just very few fights. I approve it in casual Lego games. Ok, not ""mixes"", more like ""pro-puzzle"". Still approve.Anyway, if you are fan of Harry Potter and got a friend, try this one. I liked it a lot. If you are not, then ehhhhhh yet another Lego game.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

The only problems are the controls (Which you can change) But when you exit the game and re-open it, You'll have to put in the controls again.

												I would reccomend this mostly to the age range between 8 - 15, or to serious fans of Harry Potter or Lego. I have never thought to myself ""I shall sit down and play some Lego Harry Potter"", but it's great fun to play with my little brother.The gameplay is similar to most of the Lego games, and understandably so to the first game. The open part of the world is much larger, as you can go from the Diagon Alley out into actual Muggle London and down to King's Cross Station, as well as having most of the Hogwarts areas from the first game.Storyline-wise, it follows the 5-7th Harry Potter movies (no prizes for guessing that). The 'dialogue' is the traditional Lego 'grunt-and-point' that we've come to expect, but it's not as funny as in the old Star Wars games.It's a perfectly good game, but I was never much impressed by the books/movies it was based off, so I'd give it a solid 7.5 out of 10.[Edit]: Having now played it to completion, I have only one thing to say: Bogrod.

												Unlike the previous Harry Potter Lego, this game's jokes are a bit off-putting. Especailly if a fan of the book. Some are hilarious, but others fall short, but that's a problem with how much darker the source material got and the people who made this game trying to get in jokes and hilarious moments in the sensitive and depressing scenes of the series such as the death of various main characters.The last two years are a massive pain with Death Eaters appearing everywhere and then causing you damage by shooting you and getting mobed by them. This is a cause of frustraition, however as this mostly happens in the last part of the game then you don't lose any studs when you get killed which is very suiting.As I managed to unlock the x4 multiplier I've managed to get enough studs to afford anything and make completeing this game 100% so much easier.I really can't wait to play the Marvel Lego heroes game.

												This is the best game in the world! It's great comparing the scenes in this gae to the same scenes in the books and films. Playing this game has insired me to finally watch the later movies, and that has greatly improved my life. :D The game does require some more content, though. More spells on the ring! And the spells don't work on everyone; it's rather annoying when stupefy doesn't work on Umbridge. I had a thought for apparating; that there could be a button you press and then you select any place that you've been, then you apparate there. And it would be nice if the apparition effect were the same as in the movies. Another complaint would be the bright colours of Lego bricks detract from the mood, and I don't like the satire much, but I suppose it's a Lego game, and that's what they're like.    Even with these faults, I still give the game fifty out of ten :)			",1,2,2,0,4,0,0

												Much better than the first one in graphics, gameplay and the fact that it hasn't crashed once yet (apart from when I first loaded it).

												My experience is heavily biased by having just finished years 1-4.  It's not a *bad* game... it's just not as enjoyable as the first game.  There's nothing specifically awful, it's just that every aspect of gameplay feels slower or has little niggles that make it more awkward and interrupt the flow of destruction.I wanted to get all the collectables in the first game, this one just felt like a chore.

												What a disappointment!!! I was so looking forward to this game after the amazing years 1-4, but I couldn't even get past the second scene without giving up.My problems:- which idiot decided to change the control settings from game 1 to game 2???- everything that's within a few steps from where you are is blurred............. and gets unblurred when you get closer........... talk about a migraine trigger- the camera changes angles at the most inconvenient moments :X- Harry has conveniently forgotten all his spells from years 1-4 except for one, even the ones gotten through the storyline.......Honestly, this game should have been a breeze and enjoyable after getting the hang of years 1-4, yet I feel like I'm playing a completely different game, which is not quite what I was expecting. The blurring thing and the changing camera angles is a serious deal-breaker.			",36,11,0,23,12,0,20

												Maybe Harry Potter could cast a magic spell over us before we see his new movie.He could point his magic wand and utter an incantation like ""NoDozeium Offem."" Or ""RedBullium Energizus.""That might help get us through ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"" a mystical slugfest of gloom, doom, death and dysfunction, a wearying tale of color-bled, never-ending scenes of isolation and despair, mistrust and miscalculation.Hard-core Harry fans will not be deterred by the meandering plot and bleak parade of expository sequences piling into each other.But how else could ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" be anything beyond what it is: a beginningless, endless warmup act that lays the foundation for the climactic Battle of Hogwarts in Part 2, scheduled for release July 15?Director David Yates has already supplied us with two well-crafted ""Harry Potter"" films: ""The Half-Blood Prince"" and ""The Order of the Phoenix."" Screenwriter Steve Kloves has performed a masterful job of translating and condensing J.K. Rowling's epic novels to the silver screen.Only after Part 2 comes out will anyone be able to gauge if breaking Rowling's seventh and supposedly final Harry Potter novel into two movies was the best decision.Meanwhile, Yates and his crew should be commended for sticking to Rowling's literary vision and not dumbing down the material for ""Harry Potter"" neophytes, who won't have a clue what's going on in some of the character-driven plot developments.With the sinister Snape (Alan Rickman) apparently in the camp of Harry's arch nemesis Lord Voldemort (the serpent-like Ralph Fiennes), our intrepid trio of Gryffindorians has a quest: to locate and destroy a series of ""Horcruxes,"" objects that contain bits of Voldemort's dark soul.Voldemort devotes himself to finding and killing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). So he and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) take drastic, sad measures to protect their families as they go on the lam to stay alive long enough to find the Horcruxes and the magical sword that can destroy them.Despite frequent attacks by the Death Eaters and occasional scenes of bravery Harry's friends volunteer to become Harry clones to distract assassins ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is a measured, leisurely movie.Its showcase sequence is an extended, dramatically arid stay in the woods where the trio hangs out, and because of the influence of a Horcrux (or something else?), Harry and Ron bicker over the perceived affections of Hermione.There's actually a fairly steamy moment when an emotionally ravaged Ron, looking like an extra on the set of ""The Walking Dead,"" sees Harry and Hermione in a sensuous naked embrace, a hallucination inspired by the Horcrux.""The Deathly Hallows: Part 1,"" opening at midnight Thursday, marks the darkest, most violent Potter film so far. John Williams' familiar and comforting Potter theme barely surfaces in Alexandre Desplat's subtle, appropriate score. This is not a familiar and comfortable film.Neither is Part 1 a completely dull movie with long, lingering shots of monochromatic vistas. It packs a few narrative surprises here and there, and brandishes moments of quietly exploding drama that give Watson, Grint and Radcliffe the best acting workouts of their lengthy Potter careers.Originally, Warner Bros. wanted to convert this first film into 3D, but canceled the plan because time did not permit the process to be done properly.Too bad, because I can think of at least three shots in Part 1 where the 3D effects would have jolted viewers into the rafters.

												So I bought this alongside the LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 and completed the first game prior to moving on to this.Like the first game, this game is also very broken with graphic glitches galore and appalling AI.  Whilst fun to start off, it becomes tedious by the end.  When you go to buy extra characters or select other characters to play, the tokens constantly changed between unlocked and locked.   To say this element is what the game is all about, why has this never been fixed?  The lighting on this game is incredibly harsh and can white out the screen.  At least on the more positive side this game does not crash on certain levels preventing the player from advancing unless hidden game files are modified.  The AI of other characters is nothing more of a nuisance.  I can be in a big battle and yet the other characters stand there like lemons as if nothing is going on.  If they're not standing around like a lemon, they'll be getting in your way constantly.Advise you buy in the sale and not full price for a broken game.			",3,1,0,0,8,0,3

												I cannot in good faith recommend this game. It has everything that all of the previous LEGO games have, but it also comes with its own problems. The main one is that it can be incredibly boring. A few of the missions just don't have anything going on with them. No enemies, no plot points, nothing. Then when the game realizes that you probably should have enemies, it spams you with them, so you literally have to stop everything you're doing every few seconds to beat them. It gets repetitive, and shows that the game developers don't realize that there's a big difference between challenging and annoying. The makers of Candy Crush also have no idea what that line is, but whatever. Also, all of the best LEGO games have humor, or, at the very least, characterize their characters pretty well. They're fun to watch. That is not the case with this one. I didn't really care about any of them. Most of the levels feel like busywork instead of actual levels that advance the story. Heck, some of the levels in between the levels that weren't really levels were more interesting than the levels we got. I'd say that, if the game got one more re-write for the story, it could have been a lot better. As it was, it had a few glaring problems. I'd say no to this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game, combining Lego and Harry Potter again.  However, it suffers from even worse technical glitches than its predecessor.  I had to uninstall the game after it caused multiple blue screens and even a computer restart.  I got to a part in the last year of the game that seemed to trigger these events everytime I reached it, to the point where I could no longer continue.  Rather than risk damaging my computer, I uninstalled it.			",283,69,3,22,10,2,14

OK, let me start off by saying > You NEED a Controller to play this game <This is a very typical example of a very poor port to PC. Even though the Keyboard control, as poor as THAT is, exists, there's no sensible use at all for the mouse. In fact, it seems the DEVS were SO lazy, they put as much thought into this as the Italians did when they built the Tower of Pizza. You simply need a controller, nay, an XBox controller to play this game.So, in conclusion;•	The PC controller scheme sucks•	it's ALWAYS advisable to build on a good foundation, and•	the world STILL wobbles uncontrollably.

												Although this games works 100% I can't recommend it because years 1-4 fails to work at all and this is clearly an issue a lot of people have had with years 1-4. And a major failure in this game is the complete lack of dialogue, the game may look like Harry Potter but it sure as heck doesn't feel like when you're playing it with the characters just moaning and groaning the whole time, I played for 30mins and just couldn't stand it anymore. I should have researched the games better here on Steam to discover the problems people have had and to find out there's no dialogue from the movies so it's my own fault that I wasted money on these games. At least LEGO Lord of The Rings is MUCH MUCH better!			",93,15,0,4,8,0,2

												While some Potter/LEGO fans may love this title I cannot look past the horrendous cut scenes; the characters do not speak instead they mumble like they have food in their mouths.I hate not recommending this game because the local co-op game play is awesome but the cut scenes really ruined this game. All the other LEGO games I have played have not had this issue. I have read it is due to copy write but that is no excuse.			",137,28,2,7,7,0,3

												Game doesn't run. It's not my PC either, it's the game. I've been hunting down solutions for the horrendous fps drop, but everyone is having the same problem and the developer hasn't fixed it. Doesn't even work on the lowest resolution settings. I don't understand this, because the first game worked great. You're better off just rereading the books at this rate.			",12,4,0,5,2,0,0

												This is the first LEGO game I've ever played and I absolutely love it. I purchased it last Monday and by Wednesday I had already completed the story. So far I'm working on unlocking everything. I loved the gameplay and the humor elements they added were great.The only issues I have is the wonky controls, where you have to work hard to get vehicles to do what you want and to get your character to go in the correct direction, and the fact that they cut out some important things like all of the deaths in Deathly Hallows.Besides that, the game is fun and I would definitely recommend it!

												This game in the series becomes harder to recommend than the first. Stuttery frame rates on a 4k series I7 tied with a GTX 780ti shows poor optimization (tried with a variety of drivers to the same effect). Also, the story telling just felt off, with both me and my wife (who have read all the books and films) feeling slightly confused about what is going on.The other big let down is, a heck of a lot of assets from the first game have been re-used, making the whole game feel like an add on and repetitive. We also managed to get our characters or important objects stuck in scenery, and unable to progress revealing game breaking bugs. Having to restart a level a third time because of this lowered the fun levels deep into the frustrating. Compared with newer Lego titles like LOTR, this game holds no candle. Buggy, un-optimized, rehash feel that has no chance of me ever going back to get 100%.Would only recommend to die hard fans, and even then only just. For everyone else, there are much better games in the family co-op genre out there. 6/10			",716,264,22,74,58,6,80

												The graphics in LEGO HP: Years 5-7 are a pretty big step up from the first game. The semi-open world is also a bit more interesting, but not quite as filling as LEGO LOTR. I could talk about story, but it's a LEGO game based on an internationally known IP, so I won't. And I could talk about gameplay, but it's a LEGO game, so I won't. That said, it's a LEGO game based on a beloved franchise, and they stick close to the source material, namely the movies here, while also keeping that LEGO humor. Overall, this is a good LEGO game.8.5/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												I'll say one thing about this game right from the start and that is that my feelings on it are quite mixed in some aspects.The gameplay and graphics are vastly improved from Years 1-4 plus the area you can explore is simply GINORMOUS and I found the humor to be quite good overall.It's said humor though why my feelings are mixed as it often ends up creating a great mood whiplash.For example, during Year 7 Part 2 (the game follows the movies to create four chapters same as in years 1-4) in the part where Harry and the others find Snape dying it at first seems to be played seriously with a very different and sober track playing but by the end of it they SHOVE HIS HEAD INTO A BARREL to get the memory (about him having loved Lily and working as a double-agent for Dumbledore) and then Harry and the lot happily walk out.That said, I may be taking things to seriously with this game since it is a LEGO game after all but in my opinion the darker parts of the HP story just don't translate well at all.(Looking back at the end of Year 4 in Y1-4 and cringing hard)Nice game but play for the jokes and the interpretation of the story, not the original story.

												I don't know why many gamers can't get this game running, luckily it works on my pc and I'm happy to play it because it is so well made!! The scenes recreates almost exactly the movie and characters are also funny!It can be tedious sometimes to smash all the bricks or defeat bosses but overall I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Harry Potter.It's much more and more and more and more enjoyable if played with firends in local Co-op!I didn't try with 2x Keyboard or 2x Xbox360 controller, I play it with a keyboard and a controller and they works great simultaneously.The only issue of this game is that sometimes the keys change layout or lose the configuration, good that there's only a few key to map, each time the game starts. But it only happens at the beginning I noticed, now I play it without mapping 'em again.yes, would recommend it!			",123,10,6,8,7,1,6

												Harry Potter (and Voldemort) meet LEGO for the final time in years five to seven, right before Potters' big graduation from Hogwartz. This installment is significantly better than the last, and for a great many reasons. You'll have the chance to play through the final movie installments ranging from London to Hogwartz, and you'll encounter infinitely more interesting foes and friends.The lack of voice acting may be equally as shameful as it's predecessor, but it's not missed in this one as the immersion is outstanding. In this game you'll feel a part of the world and all of it's charm, you'll find a beautiful artistic direction which embraces the darker nature of the story. You'll also for the first time get to play through history, and as the three men in the story of the dealthly hallows.The mechanics are a lot better and more interesting and they feature a dueling mechanic which could feature as it's own game it's that much fun. In a Kame Hameha style want battle, though it was extremely badly implemented in the original, the sequel has refined this fantastic ability.If you enjoy LEGO games, if you like Harry Potter, you'll definitely enjoy this title. It gets to a point where you're almost taking as many screenshots as you may in the Hobbit and LOTR LEGO titles.			",141,23,2,7,3,0,6

												Awesome Game. Only improves upon years 1-4. Graphics UP a level. Hermione and Ron look wayyyy more like they actually do, along with Sirius,Remus,McGonagall,Voldemort,Bellatrix and the Weasleys. Lots of new additions... THE DUELLING IS SICK! Also Luna and the spectrespecs, apparation to name a few. The spells work a bit differently but thats a good change. We've now got aguamenti, diffindo, and more. BUY THIS GAME! it also has great replay value, like you go back to the levels but it goes wayyyyy faster then you get the characters and just save and quit all in 5-10 mins per level. Soundtrack is BEAST. Only critiscm is that they still don't talk but they make it very obvious what is going on. Overall, BEST LEGO GAME EVER			",9,3,0,0,2,1,1

												Once again, playing another Lego Game as I have become quite addicted, mainly to the point this particular one and a few others were bought for me as a Gift by my Boyfriend, bless his heart and love him massively for being so sweet... I find myself truly enjoying this Harry Potter Game along with the First Harry Potter which again my Boyfriend bought for me as a Gift..... Being a slight Harry Potter Movie Fan, I like seeing how accurate these characters are to those in the Films, going through the Storylines myself as these beloved people I've grown very fond of (in an odd way) and learning to use the spells that they too also learnt to use.  Basically I rate this Game as a Goodun to Buy but ONLY if you are addicted to Lego Games, because these types are more of a puzzle solving games and may be quite boring to those who are more used to guns, running around with multi-players and those types. So to those who are buying this Game, welcome to the Joys of Lego Gaming.			",23,11,0,5,7,0,3
