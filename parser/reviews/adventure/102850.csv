												This one's tough for me to recommend. It's a solid concept: you're an alien that's crash-landed onto earth, and you've been brought in for experiments in a lab on the bottom of the sea. You and a mysterious alien friend of yours need to escape. The catch is that you get this ability to warp from place to place around you, including within objects. It's a clever concept, and it looks and feels pretty good for a game that lists a usual price of $10. The puzzles are generally challenging, and some of the challenge maps are quite tough.Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. You have to deal with stupid EA account BS every time you log in, or you can't access your save file. The story is pretty flat and not that dynamic, and from what I've heard, the game runs like crud on systems with older CPUs. There's little incentive to collect everything you find (no achievements, no end-game rewards, and the powerups you can get from SOME of the collectables don't change up gameplay that much). I really had to force myself to finish this game after spending maybe 4-5 hours on it total. It's not even that long, I just wanted to collect as much as I could.If you're really desperate for an indie game, I guess give this a try? Otherwise, it ain't worth it, especially if you're giving EA your money.			",455,127,7,69,23,6,41

												This game is an absolute brilliant idea for a sneaky stealth type game. You are an alien that humans have beat up, drugged, and experimented on now it’s time to get even, it’s time to free yourself. You have abilities to trick, deceive, and even make the humans explode. There is a limited amount of skill upgrades you can purchase using grubs you collect while sneaking around.The first time I warped into one of the scientist bodies and made it explode made me laugh harder than I have in a while.You look a lot like one of Gru’s minions, the one with the scuba googles on.I hear some people complaining about EA’s need to have you log into their system to play. I personally didn’t find it that bad I already have an account with them for some of my other games.I highly recommend this game one of the better ones I have played in a while.

												Buy? Likely-=TL;DR=-WARP is an amusing action puzzler about an alien that is trying to escape a high security research facility using it's ability to teleport, internally combust canisters and enemies, and create an intangible clone of itself called an ""Echo"". It's a neat mechanic that isn't used in many games and lends itself to some intresting puzzles.-=Overview=-WARP is a pretty neat game. It's semi cartoonish appearance hides it gory nature, as fragging enemies result in gory and satisfying explosions. The protagonist is a yellow alien that has been captured by humans for research. It soons gains or regains the ability to telport short distances, which allows it to move quickly and hide in objects of it's same size - which are mainly various canisters and the torso's of humans. The alien can ""charge up"" these items, causing it to explode violently. Eventually, you can earn the ability to create an echo of yourself to distract enemies and later, swap places with objects, as well as the ability to throw objects that you are hiding in. Throwing and telefragging are the only ways to kill enemies beyond environmental hazards, so you need to use the camera to scope out an area and find out to get past guards and hazards,-=Presentation=-On the PC, the game looks somewhat bad. The modeling and texture work itself and actually fairly smooth looking (though the alient model has some slight blockiness close up in cutscenes). The content and assets actually look good, but the total lack of anti-aliasing destroys that work, as everything on your screen looks almost as jaggy as PSX era games. I have a feeling the console versions doesn't have this problem. You will need use your graphics card anti-aliasing in order to improve this, but even after that, it looks more like an effect than a proper in-game smoothing. The developer failed on this part. There's not much to say about the soundtrack....I'm sure there was music and ambience, but I don't remember any track. The main menu has a nice extraterrestial sound though. The sound effects are great however - the warping effect sounds believable, explosions of objects and people seem realistic, and the alien makes a chittering, sqeaking type noise that make it seems like it came from another planet. The sound design, besides the lack of music (which admittedly, does help with the sterile research environment) works well for immersion.-=Experience=-The game is fairly easy to play and may occasionally challenge you, but most players should be able to solve the game if you understand the mechanics. I only got completely stumped once. The game plays in an isometric fashion where you never change height (slopes and stairs) except for elevators to another floor, so I never thought about the game in that third height dimension. There is one moment where you must throw a canister over a obstacle about the height of the alien. Since you never have to do this anywhere else, it's easy not to realize you have to use the crane in the area to throw a canister over that obstacle. The average player is more likely to die from environmental hazards and turrets than they are from guards. Bosses provide some moderate challenge (especially the very annoying last battle). The biggest challengs comes from finding grubs through out the world and from challenge levels, These grubs are currency for minor upgrades available at certain checkpoints. There is no respec or buyback, so you should choose upgrades wisely, but fortunately, no upgrade is so necessary that you will loose if you didn't ""Build your toon correctly"". The experience is severely ruined by the Origin/EA requirements. You have to log in to the game every time you launch, which doesn't make sense as there is no online experience beyond leaderboards and oddly enough, a friends system just for this game (it's possible that it would pull from your Origin friends - I don't have any though). You need to enter a key upon first use of the game. The login experience is pretty annoying, as it's easy to accidentally log out (at least for me) and have to log back in again. The login screen is mouse based, even though the game is mostly keyboard based and after typing your user name, you have to press tab twice to get to the password field where you can then login, and have another screen telling you that you have logged in (while still being able to control the main menu with your X Input controller, oddly enough), but having to use the mouse to click OK. It's way to clunky. More clunkyness ensues as you can't rebind the keys and it looks like the game assumes you have a controller connected (I did have one plugged in at all times, but I have a feeling the game will always show XBox style prompts regardless)-=Conclusion=-I did enjoy the game and it's unfortunate that this game didn't appear to sell well (perhaps it did ok on consoles) - I only have two friends who have this game, and nobody else has wishlisted this. I've had this wishlisted for a long time due to its interesting mechanics. I think this game could have been extended tremendously with a level editor, where players can make levels for each other. Players who like to speed run can probably get enjoyment out of finding the fastest way to play this, but unfortunately, I've only seen one video for this. Funnily enough, some of the challenge levels have clearly hacked/cheated leaderboards, with times of literally .500 seconds. It's a good puzzler that gave me about 7 hours of enjoyment. A high skill player can probably do so in 1-3 hours less.			",965,265,43,131,97,11,157

												You warp into people and turn them into blood geysers, is there anything more to say? Good atmosphere, nice sounds, good looking animations. Unfortunately this is pretty much a direct 360 port so the controls are not as tight as they should be unless you have a 360 pad, there are no video setting outside of resolution and vsync, no mouse usage, and mixed control prompts. It's a shame about the lack of graphics options because this game could go from nice looking to gorgeous with ease. Overall the mechanics,unique, well executed, and so much fun it is well worth the full price and a steal when on sale.			",209,73,5,15,17,2,31

												The concept is good. Gameplay is fun.The game is CPU intensive but shouldn't be. It is badly optimized, it lags horribly. It can become a slide show sometimes.There's also a UI problem where you can use your gamepad for everything except for login into your EA account. At that exacte moment you have to use your mouse.The puzzle difficulty is fine, but the challenges are impossible. I recommend this game only if it's on sale for 5$ or less.

You can upgrade several different skills that can really change your approach to the game -- whether you prefer sneaking undetected, running and evading capture, or blowing up enemies from inside.Graphics, sound, and controls are all nice. The story is somewhat linear, but fun nonetheless. Granted, it has that EA account nonsense, but I'd reccommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just... Wow. In a good way.Let me begin with the concept as a whole. You see many games about fighting some alien(s) that escaped containment, but how often do you actually get to play one?Then there's the playability. Even though the unusual control scheme may be hard to get used to at first, it's completely worth getting used to. The only keys you need to know are the arrow keys and C. The mechanics are wonderful.Finally, we have the story. I'm not going to say much because spoilers, but the ending was incredibly touching.Of course, there are also bad things about it. Here are some of the things I thought the game was lacking:Level editor :cA sandbox mode after finishing the game, to explore the area.A demo.And that's pretty much it. I absolutely recommend the game. It's got some of the best mechanics I've ever seen.			",136,21,3,13,27,4,34

												Entertaining, perhaps, for a time, but ultimately underwhelming. The learning curve is basically flat for the whole game till the end, where it suddenly spikes hard. Oftentimes you are placed in a situation with no solution discoverable -- obvious or otherwise. The narrator-type character's onscreen effect is the moral equivalent of alien beergoggles, it killed me more than once. The game proper has very little depth, the upgrades are too expensive for you to ever see more than two of them (of which you will most certainly want the fast-warp upgrade).I never seemed to unlock the swap/launch upgrade, even now at the supposed end of the game.The ""Explode people"" mechanic is trite, the violence is unecessary pandering.Taking a large view, this game feels short, two-dimensional (in terms of gameplay depth), and probably not worth 2$, much less 10$Strong Reject on it's merits.

												My wife bought me this game because I assume it looked cute. Holy hell was I suprised when I blew a dude up.It's an EA published game, take that with a grain of salt. Your ""progress"" isn't tracked if you don't sign in but ""progress"" is limited to high scores and distance travelled (and, you know, other things that GTA3 did for free) and all that. Don't let the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cover the diamonds though.The game is actually pretty fun. Took me a few hours and I didn't actually collect everything, not that it stops you from winning at all. Collectibles are... forgettable. I think they opened concept art or something. Didn't care. No real reason to collect all the grubs since the power ups are hardly neccesary. There are multiple ways to solve some rooms and some of the puzzles took a bit of thought. Death is quick and reloading is quick too, which is good. No long, drawn out, slow-motion falls or anything.I have a newer rig so I didn't experience any slowdown or lag issues until one wierd room in the final areas but it cleared up after I died.Overall, I recommend it. It's fun, it's different and it's a bit of a challenge. If you can stomach handing $10 to EA, go for it.			",673,155,32,92,55,5,98

Some of the puzzles further on in the game can get a bit tricky but nothing is overly complex in my opinion.  This is a really fun cute game.

												There's the good news and the bad news.The good news is- this is one of the best games I've tried this year! You're playing this cute little alien guy who teleports around and brutally murders people by blowing them up from the inside. If you've played Unreal Tournament, that's also known as ""telefragging""- actually, this game could easily be named something like ""Telefrag-the Game"" :PNow, that's kind of justified because the humans captured the little alien and were performing horrible experiments on it, and are trying to shoot it on sight without any attempt of communication, so... yeah :)The gameplay is strangely addictive and the puzzles (because of course there are puzzles) are reminiscent of Oddworld games, where one wrong step spells doom for the alien guy. Based just on those facts, I could HIGHLY recommend grabbing this game.Now... the bad news. This game WANTS you to have an Origin account. Yeah, that's EA Games for you. It asks for EA login, then it asks for the serial key, then, after activating and starting the game, it asks for the SAME serial key, only this time you can't paste the damned thing and need to type it in manually. After that, you need to log in to the Origin account, AGAIN, from the game... WHY? Why doesn't it just let me play the game when I try to start it? Why does EA HAVE to meddle with pointles layers upon layers of DRM? I guess at least the only ""good"" thing you have from all this is, the game actually registers on your Origin account as well, so yeah.BOTTOM LINE: If you're prepared to endure a bit of pointless logging in and typing a 16-character serial number manually like in the olden ages (or registering an Origin account if you don't have one), this game is AWESOME. Go get it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARP is an action puzzle game with a very unique twist, your character is able to warp through objects or into them, allowing for all sorts of possible ways to access different areas or complete challenges.  Initially the game felt a little too derivative of Wall-e in style, until you are introduced to the ability to warp inside of people and explode them from the inside out.  From that point on I was intrigued and enjoying the aesthetic of cutesy style mixed with over the top gore.  Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are supported, as is the gamepad.  The only unlikable aspect of the game is the third party EA DRM, but it's significantly less intrusive than the Ubisoft launcher or Windows LIVE.  I would recommend this title to most gamers who enjoy twitch action and puzzle solving, but be prepared for some very difficult challenges and a high twitch factor similar to Super Meat Boy.

												A great little game, its cartoon style belying a great deal of violence and disdain for human life (even more than the 'Splosion Man games).

												This game's puzzle mechanics are satisfying. They're definitely unique, especially since a preferred playstyle can be chosen. You can stealthily get around by means of trickery and concealment by creating fake copies of things and swapping around the locations of objects, people and yourself. On the other hand, you can find creative ways to use your powers to waltz on out of every guarded room without leaving anything recognizable as human behind you. You can also blend a very functional gradient between the two. There's plenty of variation in the enemies' appearances and behaviors, not to mention humorous dialogue.Where the game comes short isn't really a single issue. In general, it feels watered down. It's a great game in concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Puzzles lack variation. The art is nice, but it gets monotonous to walk through the same hallway for the umpteenth time. The aforementioned playstyles are enjoyable, but they're not flexible; upgrades are irreversible. To mitigate this, you'll have to backtrack and hunt for the currency used to purchase the upgrades, which, admittedly, can lead to some of the most enjoyable puzzles.Essentially, the concepts offered potential that was untouched. The game feels incomplete in important aspects of gameplay. Many puzzles are bland, repetitive, or unchallenging. The gameplay is somewhat incompatible with the physics engine used, allowing exploits that get you to higher elevations than you should be able to get to. The game's length is short. Overall, it feels underwhelming. I really do think that this game's core mechanics are far from lacking, but it's the nuances that overshadow the parts that would otherwise shine.TL;DR: While mechanics are creative and enjoyable, the presentation is trite and disappointing.

												Neat idea for a stealth action, sorta metroidvaniay kind of game. However, suffers from frame rate issues, poor gamepad support (mine only functioned 90% of the time, which isn't enough), UI problems, and swingy difficulty curves.It's hard to really sum up how all the little problems just add up against Warp. Small stuff like having to go back to an older checkpoint, so you can resave at your current one.Some of the worst parts of the game for me were the optional challenge rooms, which thankfully were truely optional.I actually ended up playing all the way to the final boss, then decided I wasn't having enough fun to want to spend the last 30 minutes to finish the janky, unpleasant fight, just to see the ending.Really the definition of a below average game. This could have been much better with just even a little more consideration of the overall package.Avoid this one and save your money for the next stealth game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Uh oh, poo my pants, Warp is from EA and indie?!? Hmmm!The floppy sloppy design and buggy wuggy mess you often run into mid-game definitely brings that indie feel across. Warp's a cool idea with the most mixed of executions, but it's mostly good. It's never terribly fun, but it's not like it's boring or anything, either. It just kinda floats around in the vacant, drooly department that leaves you staring at the screen until you finally reach the game's ending. There's no worthwhile story in Warp, so the bulk of the game should rely on level design when we're talkin' stealth and platforming, but, unfortunately for Warp, the level design remains middling, and difficulty pops up and down unpredictably.On that note...not shabby! ;)			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												WARP is a stealth-action puzzler where players take control of little alien who is abducted by humans and must find his way out from research facility. He must use powers of other aliens to accomplish this task while completing different puzzles and defeating his enemies. While game may last only 3-4hours it’s actually great and enjoyable. There are 3 different powers to wield and amazing locations. Also to note you can collect grubs that can help you upgrade your powers like walking more silent or just make better use of your abilities. Finally after completing story you can try out challenge room to test your skills and manage to kill enemies as quick as possible. While it may be a poor port from console it still manages to hold on high spot as good indie game. The only flaw may occur is that you are required to have Origin account, and maybe for better gameplay use controller. Otherwise great game to enjoy and relax. 8/10-Overall. 7/10-PC version.

												Warp is a console app store game brought to PC without considering the PC client base at all.  Not only that but like all games sutured onto to the glutounes corporations you need to sign up for an account under another game client to play it.  Gameplay wise the puzzles are extremly simple and clearly made by uncreative people.  You are never challanged and the upgrades you receive are never impressive.  They try to tack on some narrative like all modern puzzle games, but that falls flat on its face in how trite it is.  You won't want to purchase a soundtrack for this music score either, it's completly lackluster by all account. *SIGH* you actually feel like you're getting dumber while playing it.

												Should have been better...The game clearly has something going for, the aspects about the premise in combination with the wonderful and shining aesthetics, all of that sharing a diverse and simplistic style of playing. It is a concept that i enjoyed, however, the biggest problem about the game comes just from the first minutes as i realize the game just doesn't have the options necesary for any ""pc game"" to have.My fear began as i witness only three options in the video settings, resolution, vsync, fullscreen, i could have accepted that if the game had allowed me to play or even traverse to the menus using my mouse, it didn't.Not only that but the game is locked at 30 framerates per second.It's dissapointing to say the least, frankly the game is fun, but as i said before, it could have/should have been better.

												Bloodsire asked me to review this so here you go: You can tell this game was built for consoles. If you warp into an enemy you have to hit left and right in order to burst them from the inside. Which is cool and all, but you have to use the arrow keys. For some reason it doesn't think that WASD should be default movement, and you can't change the key bindings in options. Its okay I guess. Its kinda a puzzle lite sort of game, has some sort of clever stuff but also some frustrating stuff as well. WARP MORE LIKE PORTAL LITE IMO GET♥♥♥♥♥♥ON NERDS!			",332,43,0,21,10,0,29

												Warp is a great game if you like the combo of cute but deadly, you play as an alien who was captured by scientists who want to find out what makes you tick, you soon escape and find that you are not the only one, it is a pretty gory game, but an excellent one. It has a lot of challenges and pure genius moments that will make you smile when you complete them, very fun to play and easy to get into. My only complaint is the length of main story, but it does have challenge rooms that should keep you busy.			",366,59,12,18,11,3,15

												This game is insanely fun! The little guy reminds me of Stitch of Lilo and Stitch only he has no qualms with warping into a person and reinacting the chest popper scen from Alien. This game is a great mix of puzzles, stealth, and little bits of awesome that make me squee.			",281,64,1,45,13,2,31

												Nice Puzzle game. It has charm, good pacing and the right lenght (about 5 hours). It's not as memorable as Portal or Braid, however, and the puzzles are on the easy side. I would say $5 is the perfect price for this game. The store page says it requires Origin, but actually you just need to accept Origin's terms of service the first time you run the game, you don't need to run the client or log into Origin when playing.

												ステルスゲー＋パズルのクォータービューアクション。全編英語だけど、むしろ英語わからないほうが面白い。キャラクターが謎生物Xなので人語を解しないという要素を十二分に堪能できる。チュートリアル的な要素とトライ&エラーの要素をうまい具合に調整しているので、とてもサクサク進めるし、値段の割に結構良いボリューム。ファミコンのアクションゲームを彷彿とさせる感じが昔ながらのゲーマーには気持ちいいかもしれない。頭をつかうゲームに疲れたら、試してみるのもいいかもしれない。			",43,3,0,11,8,0,4

												Once again, i find myself encountering a game that people refuse to buy for some reason (such as my friends, wont even hear me out on it!).You play a Zero , a mysterious alien brought to a underwater science facility. Under a innocent facade, you are underestimated, until you regain your abilites...now reap your revenge in an effort to escape this evil place.Your ability? Easy, WARP. With this you can teleport a short distance in front of you, through walls, blockades and into barrels...and people.As you move through the facility, is becomes clear that stealth is vital and that you must uses your brains to solve reacurring and puzzling traps as you try to escape the clutches of the scientists.And now things get serious, as your abilites grow with (spoiler alert)  echo (a projectable ghost image of yourself), Swap (use your echo to swap places with a distant object) and Launch (shoot objects your hiding in at a violent force).And then there's Frag, the ability to explode things while your inside them, such as barrels, power supplies and...people , yes it can get a bit violent and in cold blood too, however, the scientist do talk like jerks...With impressive graphics and a rare, third-person, open roofed take on gameplay, WARP packs quite a memorable punch and will have you unable to put it down until you have all those little, slippery, impossible to catch- why-would-you-put-food-there- grubs...(one day, one day i will have all of them and purchase all the extra abilities, oh yes i will...) (for more great but surprisingly unknown games, cheak out Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet) ",71,23,0,4,8,0,3

												Funny little puzzle game.Absolutely not for kids, even if the graphic at first approach seems so.A tad to hard last boss battle and and abysmal sad ending if you kill too much people which ... it's one of the game fun things.My suggestion ?

												Terrible, terrible console port. I tried my very best raising the FPS above 20, without any success. Don't buy this one for PC. Even if it's on sale.Edit: Now that I've got a much more powerful PC it seems to work alright, with the exception of the framerate being capped when first installed. There's a handy reference to unlock it over on the PCGaming Wiki: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/WarpIt's an alright, quirky little game and quite fun. The port still stands out as terrible though, so beware before buying it.			",600,185,22,57,66,7,93

												EA sucks! They make you sign in to Origin, twice! Then they make you ""activate"" the game with a CD key, twice! The menu sustem is also crap. It's inconsistent and clumsy. Please EA, just die already.That said, the game is pretty awesome. I had a hard time putting it down and played for 3 hours in the first sitting. Graphics are good and control is decent, at least with a controller. I love all the little sounds the alien makes. If you're a fan on minions, you'll love this little guy.			",164,5,4,1,6,0,3

												Of the six games included in EA's very own ""Indie Bundle"", two titles had never crossed my ears: Gatling Guns and WARP. When I accepted from the latter its offer of a five hour journey, my expectations were low. I didn't expect anything earth shattering, but I also didn't expect WARP to be as fun as it is.Played in aerial perspective, WARP's narrative follows the exploits of an alien named ""Zero"" who finds himself captured by scientists and held hostage by mercenaries. Using his assortment of powers (primarily teleportation), Zero must escape the lab that confines him.WARP breathes fresh air into the stealth genre with its deceptively childish visuals. Make no mistake, this is not for kids. F-bombs are dropped quite often and deaths are particularly gruesome. The gameplay demands of you to not only think, but also act hastily.At the price of $9.99, WARP won't give you the most bang for your buck. But should you find it at a discount of 50% or more, it's worth a look.Grade: B			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												Warp is a game reminiscent of the old Metal Gear series, but with Portal elements. A stealth game with teleporting features is a bit of an odd mix, and so whether you like this game will be entirely up to you. I found it entertaining, but after one playthrough, I think I'm good.

												I'd recommend against picking this one up. The game was clearly built for the XBOX and so it doesn't control very well on the PC. Worse, is that the game, while novel, is not intuitive; ultimately you will find yourself getting through obstacles via trial & error. I like the idea of the game, but it's poorly executed and poorly ported.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's actually really fun, Stealth action like classic metal gear + puzzles elements like portal. but instead or portals you can warp short distances (through walls, into object even inside peoples bodies)it also features and upgrade stystem to gain new abilities or upgrade them.only thing i didnt like was i needed to sign into origins to activate the game on my PC, already had a origins account but I can see that being bothersome to some people.
