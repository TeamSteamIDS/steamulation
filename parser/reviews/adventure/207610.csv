												The Walking Dead is a story-driven adventure game.Though it feels more like an interactive story, than an actual game, it still got me from the first minute.There is not much gameplay in it, you walk here and there and talk to other people and every now and then you need to make choices (for most of them there is a short time limit).There are a lot likable (and not so likable) characters. Together with the choices you have to make, it is a thrilling and emotional experience.Highly recommended if you like story-driven games and/or adventures.			",315,208,6,26,27,4,18

												Loved every part of this game.Some people may argue that your choices don't actually matter, and I'd say they are not wrong... But they are not right either. The choices you make in the game may not have an impact on the end itself, but it will have an impact on how the story gets told to you. Will you become a respectable man, or will you be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throughout the entire game? The choice is yours. What does matter here is the travel, and not the destination.The graphics are enjoyable; you really feel like you're part of the original comics universe. The game developpers also had the good idea to create their own story and not simply take the comics story. This is not a simple adaptation of the comics books, this is a parallel story which does not make some fan services; the references to the books are smart and really not invasive.All in all, this is a simple, yet very enjoyable story-driven point-and-click, merging some humor and a lot of drama in a good and smart enough interactive story.Turn the lights off, and play it alone or with someone else, and discuss about the choices you should make or should have made.A must play!

												I really have to say this game is almost perfection. I was worried about it going in that it would focus too much on random zombie action and take away from WHY we love the Walking Dead. We like it because it actually has story and character development. Not just random gore. The game is a point and click adventure. If that's not your type of game wait for the crappy FPS coming out soon. (That I'll still probably play.) The timed decisions mechanic is a great move from the developers. Only have seconds to make a split choice really ripens the tension and panic of your situations. On top of that the game has a lot of content. 5 full episodes that can be a couple hours each to finish, with different paths and outcomes depending on how your handle things. Every choice you make can affect you way later down the road to similar to the style Mass Effect recently took.If your a fan of the show, comics, zombies in general and like a good game that will challenge your wit and morals, get it.

												The Walking Dead is an episodic interactive story adventure developed and published by Telltale Games based on The Walking Dead comic book series.  The game consist of five separate chapters which we released spread out across 2012. The game takes place shortly after the start of a zombie apocalypse in the US state of Georgia. Most of the characters are all unique to the game. You play the role of a university professor, who is also a convicted murderer. You rescue and care for a little called called Clementine.  Very much unlike other adventure games, there is hardly any puzzle solving to be found in The Walking Dead; it focuses mainly on the story and character development and relationships. The story is heavily effected by dialogue choices and actions taken during quick time events - these choices will often lead to game altering changes such as a character being killed off etc.  All of the choices and events from one episode are carried over onto the next. I have also leaned since completing the game; that Telltale actually tracked the choices made too, and helped them to influence their writing in later episodes in the story. You play the game mainly in a third person perspective and the camera changes depending on the scenery and objects around the player. You are constantly in communication with the rest of your group of survivors; you will build friendships, enemies and you will bond with most of the characters in someway. You will be emotionally attached to them, especially the young child, Clementine. While most of the game is also based around the dialogue, there are a number of quick time events throughout the series, normally I am not a huge fan of QTEs, but these are required in the story in order to get their point across and to at least keep you conscious of your surroundings when playing. Graphics do not play a huge role in this game; it is by far the least important aspect to be seen. Saying that; the art style is nice and many developers should learn from this that having top of the range graphics isn't always the be all and end all for when creating a game. The story is probably the best I have ever seen/heard in a video game; you will be drawn in from the minute you start interacting with different characters, learning about their backstory, building bonds. There are so many twists and turns in the story to keep you guessing too. By the end, if you are like me, you'll be a complete and utter emotional wreck with that the cast have gone through. This is one of the only games that has almost brought me to tears. Since the game doesn't resolve around fast paced action other than the QTEs, there isn't any real difficulty; there is no ""wrong"" choice when it comes to dialogue, you are free to let the story develop however you choose. Each of the chapters level design are so well thought out; there are tons of objects to interact with, pick up and use with you in future situations. If it is of any interest; then you will be able to do something with it. The art style really gets across how doomed the civilized world is in the ruined remains of cities and towns. I have run through The Walking Dead two times now; my first play through was back when it originally came out during the sporadic release of the episodes, and just recently when I played through them all in a big binge. It is very rare that I want to play through a game again a second time; and The Walking Dead offers exactly the same excitement the second time around; you make different choices allowing the story to change and adapt to them. The whole game takes about fourteen hours to get through all of the chapters; so you are looking at a really good length game/story too. The game can be played using a controller too - which is a nice touch given that this is the perfect sort you could play while sitting back on the sofa and soaking up the story.  I also had no other technical problems while playing. Most people already have The Walking Dead; and most will probably have already played it given it's age now. But this is a genre defining game that has brought the adventure games right back to the forefront of PC gaming. You need to experience this heart wrenching tale. Even if zombies aren't your thing; you will get emotionally hooked from the get go. Do your self a favor and play this masterpiece.

												This game is fundamentally astonishing! All characters got an interesting (sometimes dark) story. The storyline will force you to feel totally involved in this great adventure! You'll have to take tough and important decisions according to moral,logical reasoning or your affection for a character. Characters are really deep so you'll feel some sympathy (or hatred) for most of them. If you love the tv show, you'll love this game for sure! I swear you'll hold your breath til the very last minute :) I srtongly recommend it!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By and large, most choice-driven games have followed the same formula, inviting you to make your mark in the world by deciding if you want to be “good” or “bad,” and accepting the binary nature of existence. But in the post-apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead, where the titular dead walk the decaying earth, the notion of good and bad is somewhat dated. There’s no “right” when right can mean shooting an innocent child before it can turn into a flesh-eating beast, and there’s no “wrong” when wrong can mean stealing the supplies you need to survive from those just as needy as you. The Walking Dead is the story of the choices you can’t live with, and the choices you can, coming together to create an experience as depressing and pessimistic as it is remarkable and memorable.The Walking Dead never pretends to be anything less than a cruel, dour analysis of humanity’s downfall. You’re tossed into the cuffs of Lee Everett, a convicted murderer on his way to prison when the first episode begins. In the opening moments, his police escort is sidetracked by the zombie apocalypse, freeing Lee into a world that’s not nearly as comfortable as a jail cell would've been. Soon, he’s joined by the young Clementine, a child left on her own after her parents took a poorly timed vacation and her babysitter contracted a bad case of the flesh munchies. And off into the new, horrible world Lee goes, hoping to find Clementine’s parents despite knowing that they’re likely dead; off to find sanctuary when he doubts one even exists.In stark contrast to the rest of gaming, The Walking Dead is more focused on what you do than how you do it. There aren’t many traditional puzzles, per se, as much as there are tasks that you’re asked to perform to move the story forward. Menial activities like finding batteries for a radio or starting up a train aren’t all that engaging by themselves, but they serve a very necessary pacing purpose, as well as give you a chance to explore the world a bit and get to know the characters better. If you’re looking to rampage around Georgia popping the heads off of undead monsters, you’re better served by one of the many other zombie games on the market.Though some might be turned off by this minimization of traditional gameplay, it works well in the context of the game. The effect you have on the world is fairly minimal by design, mixing together Telltale’s point-and-click adventure game style with a smattering of quick-time events and choice-driven dialogue. This amorphous take on gameplay works very well to make you feel like you’re a part of the world, without allowing you to go too far off the rails. But just because you’re not allowed to stray too far off the beaten path, doesn’t mean you don’t have an actual influence--on the contrary, your words and actions actually play an integral part in crafting the world.Incredibly strong writing and voice-acting give the narrative the spotlight it deserves. The vast majority of the characters you interact with are well-developed, and it’s hard not to feel compassion for even the meanest of the bunch, making you actually care about who you foster relationships with and who you choose to disappoint. What’s more, your actions have an impact not just on the events that you encounter, but in how people treat you. Don’t back up Kenny when his son is accused of being bitten, and he might not have your back a few episodes later when you need him to. Side with Lilly when she’s trying to ration the food, and she might respect you enough to help you in the coming episodes.Your choices, both large and small, have repercussions, and can change the course of the remaining episodes--even if it’s only a slight shift. Split-second choices made later in the game can rewrite how people react to you regardless of how you’ve treated them up to that point, making each and every action all the more important. Inaction, too, is usually an option, amplified by the inclusion of a timer that makes it possible to completely miss a chance at making a decision, forcing you to sit on the sidelines and watch whatever your indifference hath wrought.These decisions wouldn't be as emotional if it didn’t feel like there was something on the line, but there is: Clementine. The hopelessness of the world would be infectious if not for her constant optimism, giving you something to fight for. She’s slow to adapt to the fact that good and evil are now meaningless, and her innocence keeps the concept of hope alive in the survivors. More importantly, it makes it harder to justify going against what you think is truly “right,” since you know you’re going to have her big, sad eyes staring up at you. It’s heartbreaking and motivational, inspirational and depressing.The Walking Dead’s success isn’t in creating a Choose Your Own Adventure game with hundreds of possible outcomes and limitless plotlines. Instead, it reflect the reality of life, reminding you that many of the choices you’re given have predetermined outcomes, and some things simply can’t be changed. And yet, this undermining of everything that makes The Walking Dead unique is arguably its greatest triumph. Despite not always being in control, The Walking Dead makes you feel as though you are. Even though you can’t always save someone from death, you can give it your best try, shaping the person you are. And it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth the effort to change what, in all likelihood, can not be changed. Sure, you can replay it to see what else would happen, but that won’t change anything. It won’t change that you’re not going to leave The Walking Dead happy. You’ll feel like you made mistakes. You’ll feel like you could have done better, if you gave it another go. At best, you’ll leave without any regrets, knowing that you did the best you could do. The Walking Dead deals in a spectrum of emotion that few other games dare to take on, and it does so with aplomb. It’s utterly triumphant, crafting a narrative that proves the power of the medium by embracing what makes it unique, leading to one of the most memorable gameplay experiences ever created.

												Telltale have made a game in The Walking Dead that helps redefine the Point & Click genre and bring into a more modern era. Alongside that they've truely mastered the art of 'choice'. Many games have attempted to bring the player choice and consequences, but few have managed to do it with great success. Most of the time the player is left with Ending 1 or Ending 2 even though they made 100 'crucial' choices throughout the game.The Walking Dead, however, manages to really make the player feel that their choices matter, if not only in the game than morally and emotionally too. It achieves this by having a very story driven game that is supported by some of the best characters in a computer game. Characters that you don't really like (by design) due to their very human faults and personal baggage, yet as the journey progresses you become fond of them - they become part of your group.That's when you know Telltale have you hooked in. They manage to pull off The Walking Dead dynamic far greater, and with more ease, than the TV show has ever achieved in 3+ seasons (to date). Sure, computer games have the benefit of having no real watershed or TV Regulations to censor it's content; yet that's not what makes The Walking Dead game effective. It's the high emotion dialect, the interaction between the characters and the observations you make as Lee (... and you will find yourself becoming Lee). All of this happens as a great underplayed soundtrack supports the drama, which at times pays a little tribute to previous Zombie Movie music (such as the electronic throbs of Dawn of the Dead's music). When I look back I find no real fault in The Walking Dead, as long as you're aware of what you're letting yourself become a part of. This isn't an action game - it's one of the best emotionally driven interactive stories you will play. It's very easy to see why this game won so many awards in 2012. So if you're a fan of strong characters, story driven gameplay, or are perhaps intrigued at the prospect of a modernised 'Point and Click' adventure then you should check out The Walking Dead. The good news is that you'll be able to play all 5 Chapters of Season 1 today, which will put you in a good place for Season 2 (which will hopefully be released early 2014).The bad news is... you'll have to wait for the drip feed of each chapter in Season 2 to be released...

 The Walking Dead 	Life won't be same as before.One of the most heartbreaking stories I've ever seen, played or read about. 9.5 /10You have to make very difficult choises through the gameplay which changes storyline, you will be impressed by this, and you have to think really fast, beacuse when you are deciding whether save boy or man , they are already being attacked by zombies in real time. When you are chatting with people you gotta have quick answers like you were actualy there, so this help you to delve into this game really deep.If you are a fan of Walking Dead tv series this is something you can't miss.

												This game is awesome, nothing less.I got 18hs straight playing it, just cannot stop until finish, through a really good and very tense narrative and different action/gameplay style who puts you in the middle of difficult decisions, which have direct impact on what's going on next.You have not always the time to think about, just react, but if your reactions are bad you can have troubles now or after, consequences brought by your decisions. And just like on real life, some of them you will have to carry with you until the end of story.Although you have to follow a lot of dialogues, more than real action, you cannot simply sit down and think, most of times. You have to be ready to act or make decisions, so you just stare at the screen, and not rarely you can feel you're really there, a deep immersion factor.Soundtrack is decent, matching the tension. Graphics are wonderful, and history too.I can see just two problems about that game:You can lost a split second, confusing by the controls, and sometimes it's lethal. The good news is that although the game have not a better save system than autosave, if you die on the middle of an action scene the autosave brings you exactly at the point you died.Also, the game have a lot of replay value, if you think you can have different decisions to make and different things to handle according on how you act before. But the game needs a way to skip some cut scenes or even dialogues faster, for those who previously finished.One of the best and imaginative games i've ever played.			",685,344,30,98,83,8,127

The graphic's in game really do a good job of putting forward the fact that this was orriginally based on the graphic novel's and at some points looks just like it but full of colour and this adds the one thing i felt was missing from the graphic novels (controversial point to raise but for me i wanted to see more colour in the book's).The sound and script in game is top notch and the voice actor's really do a good job of putting forward the emotion's that their on screen character's are feeling at certain point's in the game (the attic scene with the child and the ending scene with Lee Everett (voiced brilliantly by Dave Fennoy) i will not forget in a hurry).Dave Fennoy Interview (Lee from Walking Dead) (@ Dragon ...

(Even though the above is not from my play through this is exactally how my game ended as well)Will you want to play this game,if you are a fan of the walking dead in any way what so ever then yes and if you are also wanting a well put together and utterly entertaining piece of entertainment then look no further,just be prepared for one hell of an emotional journey that will stay in you heart and your subconscious for a long time to come.(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)			",2028,1186,31,262,147,8,210

RATING9/10GOODThe Walking Dead Season 1 is one of the best episodic ""adventure"" games if I can call it like that because this is really an adventure for us ""gamers"", I really got hooked up with the game really fast, like 30 minutes in game and I couldn't stop playing it until I finished it. Characters are simply amazing, ambient, story, plot...this is simply a game where you care about certain characters and what will happen with them. What an amazing character Lee was, while playing it there's definitely that TV Show series feeling. Definitely look into playing this, you won't regret buying it. One more thing to note, if you're getting the game, also consider getting that DLC story extension, it's really worth it.BADNothing really bad with it at all but one thing, once you finish it do not but do not start playing it again, because most of choices are leading towards the same consequences, that's what I realized while replaying it and I stopped replaying it because of that.

												I just don't get how i ignored this heart breaking and shocking story in these few years. I always love to experience emotional stories. A story which will bring my emotions and reflect back at to me. I had The Walking Dead in my library for 2 years but i felt it's not like what i love to experience. Like how Life is Strange is. But after watching just a glimps of Clem and Lee i started to play this. Starting was kinda boring for me, just when Lee was in police car. Then everything changes by it's moments. I tailored it's story by my own some easy choices and hard choices or way too hard choices. The Walking Dead is much more aggresive and different than Life is Strange. In The Walking Dead, your previous choices will have some consequences. Like at the end you'll have some. But whatever you choose in Life is Strange, ending won't be different because their endings are inevitable. So it's much more different. Well You can make better relation by your choices like supporting them, helping them, aiding them. So in return sometimes someone will help you and support you. In few moments i cried a lot but the ending just destroyed me. That was so damn heart breaking. This story have the greatest ending among every other stories. I sill feel broken in myself for Lee. I'm really inspired by him. Lee, The Greatest Hero in history.In one word, it's story was something else. I can already tell, The Walking Dead have the most heart breaking and emotional story. The Walking Dead just tugs your heartstrings with the lovable characters. You will know why this got Game of the Year award in 2012. It is totally worthy of it's price. Even i would like to overpay for this story. Now here are some iconic ways of this title,  Ways Analysis Scores   Quality An amazing title with perfectly written story  10   Characters Every characters are perfectly created and voiced 10   Utility No crashes, no bugs, no errors, no glitches for me. So i can say it's perfect 10   Controlling Feels comfortable with point and click system 10   Immersion Ultimate and unbreakable fusion between story and title 10   Design Excellently designed on 2D visuals 10   Visuals Eye soothing visuals on 2D. Feels like visuals touched with water color paint 10   Comparison Emotional, shocking, heart breaking, amazing and thoughtful than any other stories 10   Content Many kinds of contents to collect for the cause of survival 10  In this title, Clementine and Carley attracted me and Lee was the only hero there. I'm glad Lee could reach his destination. Story was too hard to experience because i had to suffer some unbearable situations. I had to choose some terrible options for someone's greater good. Kinda someone supported me and someone disagreed me. Story could lift my mind to it's serious situations. I know it's just a written story. But this story got some emotions. There was some much sufferings. In story, i could see how Lee tries to keep alive everyone until his last breath. Some people were just selfish and some were too worried about their families what they should've been obviously. But i saw how survivors killed another survivors to stay alive and live more. But some just sacrificed their precious things for saving someone else. Lee did the same. He went through every dangerous ways to save Clem. Many times i gotta go through shocking moments. This story gave us the most fearless and brave hero, Lee Everett. I can't forget this hero in my entire life. Lee changed my life and my intensions. There is no hero like him. He'll always be remembered for what he have done for Clem. One thing to say, If you experienced this story and you didn't become emotional or feel cry then you don't have heart. You are just sick and ♥♥♥♥ing stone. By experiencing this story, you can testify yourself. There will be many hard choices for you. You'll be able to know yourself.Also i voted The Walking Dead for Steam Award ""I'm not crying, There is something in my eye"".31.12.2016, here they just won Steam Award. I really prayed for this to happen. Though i always love Life is Strange but in the name of emotions The Walking Dead always comes first. You did it Lee.You went through all of this...started in handcuffs to protect everyone from a dangerous killer. Then you died in handcuffs to protect yourself from harming the little Clem who you loved and cherished as a daughter to your last dying breath ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I highly recommend the Walking Dead. This is more of an interactive story that anyone can play wrapped together like a point and click adventure. Most of the time, you're just watching a great story play out with excellent voice acting. It is based more on the comic book than the TV show, but the first episode does have a character from the TV show in a cameo. The story will have you playing Lee, a man that starts off in police custody until a zombie apocalypse happens. You will meet a little girl named Clemontine and basically be her guardian.  The story is littered with crazy and hotheaded characters, along with pleasant and reasonable ones for a nice contrast.In this story, you make decisions that affect lives. Who lives and who dies. After completing the game on PSN and going through it on Steam, I have a pair of play throughs contrasting. Even small choices like who you side with in arguments will drastically affect the dialog, but not the story. Everything will unfold in a way that is pre determined, but its always your choices that will get you to the same place. Basically someone will always have to die and someone will always hate you. The story gets pretty intense and they talk about topics that no other video game would touch, such as killing kids. Its not all heavy, there is some humor sprinkled in and moments of down time. Because of the choices, this warrants several play throughs, but nothing really changes the game, so much as the dialog and how people react to you.The game is broken into 2+ hour episodic chunks that come out every so often in 5 episode 'seasons.' You can either buy the episodes one by one, or buy the season pass. There is even an interlude episode to bring you from the first to second season. Personally, I say wait until a season is over to buy the entire season than play episode by episode month after month when they come out.			",1128,324,52,104,96,15,167

												The game is just very captivating and moving. Music and climate are high. The man despite the fact that the game can be completed in little more than 10 hours can really bind strongly to the characters. Dedication, fear, mutual aid, quarrels, the joy of trivial things etc. I think playing shows all the possible emotions of people posed in such a situation. The diversity of our comrades characters differ greatly. Some of you may not like, but overall a really polished game. The graphics in this game is not the most important, and this line not everyone can appeal to, but I think it's really cool it looks as a whole. As someone got hold of the devaluated on Steam did a good step. In terms of story, the game for me is in second place when it comes to the game in general. The game really moves and the final scene almost brought me to tears. I would recommend! 9.5 This assessment perfect for this game.			",654,209,26,42,57,8,68

												Finished the game and 400 Days DLC some time ago. I have to admit that my eyes got wet after finishing main story.Sadly i can't say the same about DLC, which was short, not actually shocking, very predictable and most important - lil' bit boring.Not sure what thoughts did they have while making the DLC, but i am sure that none of the REAL Walking Dead fans liked it at least in a half like main game. That DLC was just too short to even feel a bit of the atmosphere. Can't say it about Lee's story - which gave me a lot of intense feelings.If i had to rate the game, i would give it:The Walking Dead - 10/10 (honestly, it is the best game i ever played).DLC? I'm giving it 5/10, just for having ""The Walking Dead"" in the title.			",570,190,26,95,37,9,81

It's very emotional. This game reminded me of the graphic novels. Glad I bought this. Really worth on sale. Wouldn't pay the full price though. Great game overall and I recommend it.

About the GameThe Walking Dead game is a telltale game that tells the story of a man named Lee who is on his way to prison for committing a murder. The trip takes an unexpected turn as his life turn into a living hell.Storyline/GameplayJust like it's TV series counterpart. The Walking Dead game is not about killing zombies. There is barely an action in the game. TWD focuses more on the psychological effect of a world crisis into the human mind. The game will handle mostly about frustrations and being smart. You could say this game involves a lot of puzzle-like gameplay utilizing what's around to survive. The puzzles aren't that hard but it might be tricky for some and it can get really boring and repetitive. Mechanics""This game is taillored by how you play.""True and false.This is very misleading. Although changes are made when you pick different choices in the end it will go back to the linear storyline and proceed accordingly without taking your choices into account. From time to time, you'll see ""<name> will remember that"" but they do not have an impact to the game. The same thing basically happens just different dialogues.GraphicsThe Walking Dead series gives off a thrilling atmosphere despite having intentional cartoonish textures and low-poly models. But overall, how the entire world and character are designed makes this game really good overall.Final thoughtsAlthough I gave mostly of the bad points in this game, I still recommend you to buy it especially with a discount. The story can really live an impression to some people and you might enjoy the horrific adventure.			",410,121,2,81,31,1,37

												An emotional rollercoaster that is probably the greatest game to have ever existed. This game focuses on interactions with other characters, developing loves and hates, enemies and friends along the way. Unlike the Walking Dead: Survival Instinct game, this one IS NOT a shooter, and actually has fairly little fighting of any kind. Definitely worth the buy. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this game!

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:The Walking Dead by Telltale Games is an episodic video game based on the popular Comic Book series of the same title which was made mainstream by an equally popular TV series, also of the same title. The game features 5 'Episodes' with a 6th Episode as DLC. It boasts an outstanding plot, great characters and immersive choice and consequence based storytelling.You are Lee Everett, a professor on his way to prison for the murder of a US State Senator who was having an affair with Lee's wife. The game starts with Lee at the back of a police car when he met an accident that wounded him and killed his officer escort. All hell breaks loose when he discovers that the dead now walks and is hungry for human flesh but, in his desperate search for help, he stumbles across a young girl named Clementine. Follow their struggles as they try to survive a terrifying and deadly world in this post-apocalyptic suspense game where every choice you make directly impacts the lives of the people around you.PROS:+ Great use of 3D cell-shaded art style+ Excellent example of Consequence based choices and Story (The game's biggest selling point)+ Great Story+ Great voice acting+ Memorable characters+ True to the Comics source material+ Good game time and nice replayability+ Guilt inducing choices+ Stress inducing choicesCONS:- Restrictive camera- Very small maps with no room for exploration (I don't mean it should be sandbox, but it would have been nice if the players had more leg room)- Gameplay is a bare minimum (not much to do)- Some choices have no real impact to the overall plot- Tendency to have some boring scenes and segementsCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. RECOMMENDED for both fans of the comics and gamers who are into good stories and plots. The Walking Dead by Telltale Games is the best example of immersive consequence based storytelling I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The story is top notch with a well written and well round characters who were excellently voiced. The art style works in the game's favor as the cell-shaded world captures the look, feel and tone of the comics.Gameplay, sad to say, is a bare minimum, nothing to do more than make decisions. Some of the action sequences are heart pounding, but in it's core, its just a regular Quick Time Event scenario. The game also suffers from a restrictive camera with some odd angles. Despite these though, the game is still WORTH IT whether it be full price or sale price. This is a MUST HAVE game even for just the experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

The Walking Dead is an adventure genre zombie point & click game developed and published by Telltale Games.The Walking Dead is a game I would never forget, it is a game I incredibly love for many reasons. Out of all the Telltale Games I have played The Walking Dead would still always be my favourite, it’s not just my favourite Telltale Game maybe even my most beloved single player game that I had ever played in my life. The Walking Dead has one of the best storylines in video game history, starting from episode 1 to 5 the story is constantly progressing, always getting better. Telltale has really nailed the storyline perfectly. With the incredibly well voice actings played out by Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett) and Melissa Hutchison (Clementine), it has really brought the the characters to life making players actually feel like they are part of the character. The atmosphere of the game changes really maturely, it's never repetitive or filled with cliches and with The Walking Dead’s sound track it greatly supports the tone and atmosphere a lot.On to the characters, this is another part which I think Telltale has also nailed perfectly. Just from the first episode already Telltale has made the protagonist Lee Everett a legend, A character that players would always remember and respect, he is also my favourite character in videogames.The second character Clementine is also one of the most beloved character in the Walking Dead series,this even makes her the main protagonist in the following up seasons, season 2 & 3 and players truly adore her. As the story progresses the characters relationship develops stronger, players feelings for the characters also builds up. I won’t be sharing any spoilers of the game but I will mention the my feeling at end of the game. There are many reasons why countless players would adore Lee Everett and Clementine and this is because of their bond together. When the game reaches the end I was so attached to the characters and the story. I cried When I first saw this game I never expected it to be any good, because personally I am more into FPS games, and The Walking Dead was nothing close to FPS. (except for a few minor scenes you have to shoot zombies with your pistol in first person) Even though I read a lot of reviews and watched different game interviews about Telltale’s The Walking Dead, I still wasn’t convinced, but when I finally tried it myself, I completely underestimated The Walking Dead. This is a game I would 100% recommend to everyone, I don’t expect my review to be much of a help because this is a game you would have to experience it yourself to understand. My main point is to just give it a shot, you might like the game or you might not, everyone has different opinions. Its gameplay time is over 20+ hours which is incredibly well for a game priced at US$24.99, but trust me it’s worth it.If you dont cry to the ending, I can only say one thing you're either a guy with no feelings or a cold blooded person.

												This game is probably listed high on my list of games I have played.The whole games is a development of story and character. The sole purpose as being the player is to make the decision that could mean a multitude of different events. Either a character dies. A character does not listen or heed your advice anymore. You become their leader or you become the hated individual. This whole game is built solely on the premise that the player makes the decision through point and click. Whether conversation dialogue or quick time events, it is up to the player to decide which way he will go. Kind of like those ""choose your own adventure books"" where you jump to a certain page in the book to see what your decision brings.I have never watched the Walking Dead TV show but this game made me want to start. I thought the story and the plot around Clementine and your decision as Lee to protect her made this a compelling character dynamic and plot. It makes you the player feel relevant in the events and your decisions, which makes the point and click experience more compelling and an improvement from previous point and clicks I have played, where puzzles and story were linear.This game made me a fan of Telltale and led to me playing others from the developer. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story and character development and other games by Telltale.			",4087,1648,167,500,613,58,644

												TL;DR : This game gets you in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feels everytimeThis is the game with the deepest story I have ever experienced.Real bonds are created between you and characters in this long journey,and the game guarantees to make you feel happiness,despair,sadness or regret everytime you would have to.Hell,I've never been attached to a real life person as much as I hated/loved some characters in this game.It's totally worth the full price,tough this game could have even been priced at a higher sum and I still wouldn't regret buying it.The immersive atmosphere cannot be felt or seen in a trailer or let's play,instead TellTale ultimately manages to tailor a dynamic course of actions in which the only immersion you'll get is through YOUR personal playthrough and emotional investment.""The Walking Dead"" is a true gaming gem that will go down in history.

												The Walking Dead could have been named 'Father Simulator' as you take on the role of Lee a convicted murderer who is thrust into the role of father figure to a cute little girl, Clementine. You have to protect her as you trek your way across the United States mainland in search of her actual parents. In your cross country trip you quickly learn that life in the zombie apocalypse is much like life prior where you're just moving from one ♥♥♥♥ed up situation to another and that you need to be prepared to deal with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at every turn.This game will make you feel dem feels, and has a good art style and an interesting story and atmosphere, if you don't mind the slower pace you'll enjoy this game.

			Views: 2,452		

			We dive into Telltale's acclaimed adventure game The Walking Dead and take a look at the Brand New 400 Days DLC. Reviewed by Trent.		

 The Walking Dead fits into the comic canon and features cameos from popular characters but it's real focus is on original characters. You take control of Lee Everett, a college professor who has been convicted of a serious crime and beings the game in the back of a cop car. After escaping from his cuffs and surviving a near fatal encounter with a walker Lee stumbles into the home of Clementine, an eight year old girl whose parents left for Savannah prior to the onset of the zombie epidemic. Her innocence juxtaposes Lee's dark past and she is in many respects a source of redemption as Lee takes it upon himself to protect her and help reunite her with her family. The relationship between Lee and Clementine carries the experience. Clementine herself is very likable and despite her age she never comes off as too needy or whiny. Lee himself comes off as sympathetic and  cultivating his relationship with Clementine is an emotional investment rarely found in games. Where The Walking Dead's tale succeeds is in its focus on the dark side of humanity rather than the danger of undead flesh eating cannibals. At times it can be brutal and gut-wrenching. There are conflicts within your party, conflicts with bandits and clashes with other survivors. These situations are more compelling than facing off with walkers and offer an appreciable degree of moral ambiguity, generally culminating in a brutally nihilistic resolution. This moral ambiguity is important since most of the gameplay in The Walking Dead centers around managing your relationships with those in your party. Members of your groups almost always have dissenting opinions and it breeds conflict. During conversations you get to choose how to respond and unlike other titles that allow you to voice the protagonist and make choices, The Walking Dead features a timer that prevents you from analyzing your decisions. It keeps the tension up and the conversations flowing naturally. Who you side with and what you say determines how close you are to each person and can ultimately affect how they react in future scenarios. If a character feels that you have their interests in mind they will back you and those who you oppose may become hostile to Lee. While this sounds great on paper in practice it's not as exciting as it seems. The problem is that in spite of giving you a lot of decisions to make, The Walking Dead doesn't change much in terms of it's narrative arc. Some scenarios ask you to make a choice that to save one character causing the other to perish. These two characters generally serve the same role in the plot and there isn't a compelling reason to see both scenarios play out since you won't see any noteworthy additions to the experience. You see the same locations and partake in the same scenarios and puzzles. You as the player have little overall influence on the the narrative and the experience is cheapened by attempting to take another approach on a second playthrough since it becomes apparent very quickly how inflexible the game is. With it's episodic release schedule, it's wholly understandable that The Walking Dead doesn't feature a massive branching narrative but it would have been nice if the path you take to the conclusion of each episode could vary. As it stands there isn't much replayability in The Walking Dead.Puzzles and gameplay in the Walking Dead are rudimentary, some sequences have you aiming a weapon to take down a few walkers, quick time events are sprinkled throughout the game's five episodes and DLC and there are only a few puzzles. While The Walking Dead gleefully avoids the obtuse puzzles that characterize many point and click games it's simplicity can be off putting to veteran gamers. Puzzles have very apparent solutions and often the only objects you can pick up are the ones used to solve a puzzle. Having a few red herrings or multiple solutions to a scenario might have made these sequences more rewarding.			",1843,697,76,250,218,18,319

												The Walking Dead is second best TellTale game I've ever played. The Second best only because I liked the season 2 a bit more which is probably because season 1 made me emotionally attached ;)Your character is called Lee and he has to make many difficult choices. He can choose to tell the truth or lie to protect himself and people he cares about. Especially kids make choices not easy at all. Very often you are forced to decide between two options and none of them feels like a victory. People will die, of course. It's zombie apocalypse after all. There is time pressure  so you might regret hesitating or choosing the wrong option just because you missed  one important word when reading all options in hurry.The story is very interesting, exciting, brutal and dramatic, full of twists and surprises. Every character in  the game is very unpredictable. I remember when I was just about to like someone and side with that person, he/she suddenly did something very stupid and all the sympathy was gone. You never know what is happening inside of each of them so you never get to feel like you have a full control of any situations.Combat/Action parts are quite fun but can be stressful. You need to react fast and aim very often or search for an item which could help you. If you fail because you hesitate for too long, it will usually not happen again. It's not a very difficult game.Graphics are not impressive at all. Background textures look quite terrible but honestly who cares about a visual quality when the narrative and sounds take your breathe away, right?Warning: The game can make you feel very sad and emotional. That's very rare I would say. There are not that many games which made my eyes wet and made me drop some tears. If your heart is not like an ice cube you will love The Walking Dead!100% recommended! Go and get this game + season 2! NOW ;)			",252,57,1,14,4,1,0

												The Walking Dead is a narrative-driven adventure about a zombie apocalypse that has the feel of an interactive comic book.  This is executed perfectly by Telltale with a cell-shaded art style that mimics a comic and a very well-written story that tailors the story to the choices and actions of the player.Gameplay is very simple.  The player is often presented with choice-driven dialog.  The narrative is carefully paced through player interactions with objects and persons in the environment and the action pieces are accomplished via quick-time events.  This style of gameplay is perfect since it does not burden the player with complex mechanics and allows for focus on the plot and story elements.As I have already mentioned, the story is very well written.  Characters are well developed to the point that I cared about them.  Tough decisions are often presented which were almost always painful to make.  What really impresses me most is that this game is presented as a survival story and the zombies are often not the worst dangers to the team.  This really makes me think deeper about the primal nature of humans and some of the disturbing things we would do to survive at all costs.  This is not your typical zombie game.  I have never watched the TV series that this is based on, but if the narrative for those shows are like this game, I may just start watching these.This is a very good game for those who like narrative-driven adventures.  I highly recommend.In addition, if you are an achievement hunter, it is very easy to 100% this game by simply doing a single playthrough.			",230,21,2,26,20,4,45

												It is what it is and it's a rather enjoyable game if you let it tell its story with the minimalistic gameplay and non puzzles. It's the ride that counts here and any fans of the comic book will enjoy that a lot. At least your decisions have consequences even if they are not as far reaching as you would hope at times so in that regard its far more of a RPG than most so called RPGs nowadays.

At the moment of this review I have played for 14 hours. I could go for another round to see a different situation.Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? YES. More than 30.000 hands up can't be wrong.A few words about this game? It's hard. It will make you feel it, even if you don't want to.  Do you like zombie games? This IS your game.

Graphics: It's a game released on 2012, It's a point and click type, and comic style. That's important because it's not a top graphic game, but here this is not the most important. Let's say that it accomplish it correctly. Music: The music... ok... does it have music?. Just joking! The music is there but so soft, so into the background that you barely notice it. That is not bad and it really goes with the drama, the action moments, the sad ones... but it not stands out. I can't remember a song that provoked me some emotion. 


Peaceful day

Story: Ok, here is the reason of so many positive analysis. The Story is really GOOD. From the beginning to the last moment, It traps you, introduce you inside the skin of Lee and makes you feel the fear, the despair, the horror, the sadness, the fatigue... and besides that, you will be living it, because you will influence that story and when something bad happens and if it's your fault, you will feel bad, or angry in case it's from another one fault. The game allows you to modify some variables of it. Not drastically, because if it's wrote that one npc will die, you can't do anything to avoid it but others will change, mainly, your relationship with the members of the team.For real, this is the BEST part of the game.Gameplay: As I said, It's a Point & Click game/adventure. You can't run, you can't skip kinematics, you don't have an inventory or the option to hide when you want to. The story will determinate when you have to do it. In combats you will have to move fast to kick, to press a lot of times the ""Q"" to charge your strength to move something of to push away a zombie who jumped on you. In general terms you will enjoy it a lot.Negative point: The end of the game is already wrote.  All your actions will adjust to fit that at the end, so, if you saved one person because you really like it over the other option, and the game don't have the possibility to let him/her be alive at the end...

												When it was first announced that The Walking Dead would be getting a video game version, you wouldn't have been crazy to assume it would be some kind of survival horror shooter. After all, zombie shooters seem to be all the rage these days. But The Walking Dead was never really about shooting zombies, instead focusing on the horrible things people do when trying to survive. Zombies aren't as scary as people pushed to their limits, and it just takes a couple walking corpses to get people to show their worst. So instead of some sort of bullet-filled slaughter-fest, Telltale has decided to create a socially focused point-and-click adventure game.On the surface, this genre fits The Walking Dead superbly. The game forces you to make harsh decisions constantly. Nearly every dialogue choice is timed, forcing you to answer with your gut instinct. As a result, the main character Lee Everett very quickly becomes a reflection of yourself, causing you to empathize with his plight. Though this does get annoying at some points, most notably points where there really isn't any sort of urgency to your response, it does successfully prevent gamers from exploiting the system to always pick the ""right"" response.The decision-making in The Walking Dead is probably the most enjoyable part of the game. Let's get something straight right now: There is no happy ending to a zombie apocalypse. At times, you will have to choose who lives and who dies, and that is a weight that will sit heavy on your shoulders. Very simple decisions could mean the difference between surviving and becoming zombie chow, and it's not always obvious which decision you should make. Thankfully, it's incredibly hard to get a ""game over."" Your comrades might die, but you continue on, dealing with the ramifications of your decisions while you're just trying to live another day in a zombie hellhole.One thing that makes The Walking Dead stand apart from other adventure games is its constantly updating tip system. The game informs you via pop-up notices whenever you do something actively important to the story. It will notify you as to how people are reacting to your decisions and remind you of important facts you have learned. Because of this, you don't feel like you are flying blind during social interactions. The game notifies you of the consequences of your decisions, and this not only lets you play the game more intelligently, but also makes subsequent playthroughs much more fun as you know exactly where the story branches off.The writing for the most part is great, but there are some strange parts that feel like they were put in just to pad things out. An example is when an adult radio journalist needs your help to get a radio working. Not only did she not realise that it had no batteries, but then she asks you to find her batteries because she wouldn’t know what they look like. I’m sorry, but my four year old niece could have gotten that radio working, so that whole “quest” came off as more annoying and made the character look a lot stupider than she is presented otherwise. I mean for God’s sake, she’s the character that everyone lets hold the gun!This game is certainly not a point-and-click adventure in the traditional sense. The focus on building an inventory and solving puzzles is seriously toned down, replaced by an intense focus on story instead. It feels more like a ""cinematic gameplay experience"" than a traditional point-and-click puzzler. It would be more apt to compare the game to Heavy Rain, a sort of interactive movie, than to Monkey Island.When there are puzzles, the game makes sure that they aren't too hard. Everything you can interact with is highlighted with clickable icons so you are never stuck wasting time trying to find that one important item you missed. Your inventory isn't even usable in the traditional sense. You can't access it in any way. Instead, simply having an item will bring up new options when trying to interact with other people and your environment. Some of these interactions are red herrings, of course. I once tried to use a remote control on a combination lock, only to find that the remote ""wasn't that universal."" Still, the game greatly streamlines the traditional point and click gameplay process.Not only that, but failing puzzles doesn't necessarily stop the game. Instead, the game simply continues on, generally leaving you in a disadvantageous position. Unfortunately, this does mean that you can miss out on some important story details by performing certain actions too early, and this makes the story feel like It's jumping around a bit. At one point, I found out that two characters liked each other, only this wasn't until one of them had already met a tragic end. If I had talked to people in a different order, I would have known this ahead of time, which would have made the death scene hit much harder.As gripping as the story is, there are some major flaws in the gameplay that mostly stem from its adventure game formula. This mostly has to do with finding item A to give to person B to progress the game. At one point you have to find a picture of a zombie in order to convince your friend that he once worked at a pharmacy and may have the pharmacy keys. However, the zombie is the only one in the area wearing a pharmacist's uniform, and this is very easy to see even from far away. Similarly, the picture doesn't even look at the zombie, which at this point is rotted beyond recognition. It felt like I should have just been able to say ""Dude, look at what he's wearing."" But I couldn't.Points like these pop up all throughout the game. At one point you can't reach a brick that is a few inches in front of you, even though there are tons of long objects that would allow you to knock it your way. To reach it, you have to get outside, but to do that you have to axe off the lock on the gate. This would be a fine puzzle, except you find the axe at a motel—which you get to by leaving the place you were via the back entrance. If leaving via the back were so easy, you literally could have just gone around front and picked up that damn brick. There's also a whole puzzle about finding a weapon to kill zombies with, but at this point you had already passed several knives, canes, and even a shotgun that the game didn't allow you to pick up. It just breaks your sense of immersion at points. It strikes me that these puzzles could have easily been reworked to be more plausible.As much as I nitpick, I still enjoyed The Walking Dead. As a fan of the comics, the game absolutely nails the tone and setting. Important characters like Hershel and Glen make an appearance, and they act just as you would expect them to. The voice acting is great, and the models are very expressive. You can tell exactly when someone is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you, or terrified at the zombies that are chasing you.

												‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍In my opinion, this game is just great! Yes, there's a simple gameplay, simple quests in the game. I reccomend this game to people who like story line. Everything you do impacts the future. Just imagine yourself in the place of the protagonist, what would you do at the moment? Sometimes it's too difficult to make a choice in the dialogue. Very hard to make a choice when you need to help two people who are caught by walkings, but you can only help one... ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍Here you meet a little girl, Clementine. You think ""Oh, another one freaking problem..."". But later, you see this isn't just a little girl who studies in the first grade. This girl is even stronger in spirit than tough guy with steel muscles, she is wiser than many of the survivors. Here you set a major task to defend her at all costs. ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍The ending... It's hard to watch. But I won't reveal the plot. Occasionally in the game take place absurds, but i'm ready to forgive the developers for such a story and incredible cast. ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍The only lack is the DLC ""400 days"", it sucks.  9.5/10			",282,68,11,29,19,0,36

												In recent years we've seen a new dawn for the dead in video games and so it's perhaps unsurprising that The Walking Dead comic books by Robert Kirkman and hugely popular TV show by AMC has been given a video game release. Like a movie from the master George Romero, zombie games often have the word 'dead' in the title: If not walking, they are left 4, rising or on an island. However unlike a George Romero movie these games place very little emphasis on the previous lives of the zombies before they joined the ever swelling ranks of the undead. In all other zombie themed games I've played previously there is no sense that these infectious and deadly creatures were once your neighbours, your friends or even husbands, wives and children. Indeed by contrast the Walking Dead game is not an all out action game it is very much story driven and one requires as much watching as it does playing.Your adventure starts with you (Lee Everett) convicted of murder being taken to jail. Whilst on your way to serve time for your crime the zombie apocalypse has started and a crash on the highway leaves you free but dazed, confused and surrounded by the hungry undead. I won't say much more about the plot but soon after you meet Clementine, a young girl left on her own and you will perhaps agree with me that she is one of the best characters ever created in a video game.Throughout the episodes you will meet lots of other survivors and every charcter is incredibly well designed and accompanied by professional voice acting that is convincing and appropriate for the setting. The cel shaded art style fits perfectly with the comic book series really brings the characters to life. But the real beauty of the game is how you interact with other characters and how they ultimately relate to you, the decisions and the convesations that you have. There are a few crossroads that you find yourself at and you'll be forced to make a choice, quite often with very little time to consider the ramifications. Many choices have consequences and can mean life or death for those around you.The game is played very much like a point and click adventure allowing you to examine objects and interact with other characters via a dialog option This play style is broken up with quick time style events when action is required which might be fighting off a zombie with a weapon or bare hands, escaping from an enemy, avoiding gunfire or accessing a building. It's a surprisingly satisfying experience and these action sequences can often be very tense and nerve-racking as you'll often find yourself in a mini panic as you struggle to survive.This was an emotional rollercoaster and I found myself sat in silence pondering what I might of done differently as the credits rolled up the screen. Indeed, I was sad that experience was over and I was left wanting to find out more. What happened to a character in particular? I wanted and in fact needed to find out. I started season 2 and very much like a binge on Netflix found myself saying ""just one more episode!"" ",911,413,29,216,68,6,104

												The Walking Dead was an emotional and an adventerous journey. It's one of those rare games that make you feel for the characters and get attached to them and their story. While the gameplay is pretty simple, it's the decisions that you have to make which are hard, too hard at times. The circumstances and situations that are portrayed in the story makes you see how tough decision taking in life can be. If it''s tough for you to decide something major in a video game, about fictional characters then I can only imagine how tough it would be in real life. In some cases where I had to decide the fate of someone who killed my friend or something similar and was clearly a bad guy, even then compassion comes into play and even deciding the fate of a murderer gets really tough. The game makes you do brutal things. Physically normal under  such circumstances as presented in the game but emotionally brutal.The story of this game is grasping and really interesting from the start. The decision making and choosing what or what not to speak is a great factor that makes the game. The quick time events are great as well. This game would make you feel contemplative many times, sometimes a bit melancholy, might even make you shed a few tears and would also make you feel enraged at which points you would feel like killing a character or beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them but when the game actually gives you the choice to do that, it would become a hard choice. Funny how the human mind works.			",1001,407,36,150,107,15,182

												The Walking Dead TV show on AMC has broken worldwide audience records and every new season just keeps upping the ante on the previous one. This game is based on the official TV show, but its story is different with new characters, although they still evolve in the exact same zombie world as in the original TV show.There have been too many zombie-themed games prior to The Walking Dead game, but the latter infuses renewed energy into an over-exploited genre. Its primary strength lies in its story. The graphics and game engine are particularly fine-tuned to deliver the intended experience. Oh, what a fantastic story! The script is simply superb and pushes the limits all the time. You can never be sure of what's going to happen next. Any of the main characters can meet with some unexpected event and die. You learn that early in the first episode. The game itself revolves around your decisions and the consequences of your acts will guide the rest of the gameplay. The first season comprises of 5 episodes plus 1 DLC which bridges the storyline between season 1 and 2.Throughout the game, it really surprised me that some of decisions i made from episode 1 still carried over to the other episodes, until the last one. The characters reacted differently to what i had expected as they recalled some of my actions in the previous episodes of the game. This changed the game and ultimately the game experience. You can replay this game several times and depending on your choices when interacting with the characters and the game itself, you will be able to explore The Walking Dead game's universe even further. This game reveals surprises at every corner. The human factor and the line between what's morally right and what's needed to survive is often blurred. You will have some difficult choices to make as the story evolves but sometimes you just have to do what it takes to get out of the situation alive.It's zombie apocalypse and civilization has ceased to exist. You play as one of the survivors in a small group, not knowing what to expect. The game delivers a truly excellent story, right next to the high standards set by the original TV series. This title is basically half movie and half game. Explore and appreciate the realism and consequences behind your every click and turn.			",335,88,19,43,34,2,43

												I never mentioned this story, but Telltale's original point and click masterpiece ""The Walking Dead"" has a very special place in my heart. At the time I thought that Telltale created a whole new genre, which we all immediately fell in love with, but after their latest games (Borderlands, Game of Thrones and Batman) I can see now what actually made me love TWD.Telltale's TWD was one of my first games on Steam. Back then I didn't know how to check the forums or even properly use Steam. So when this game came out, I bought it and when I finished episode 1, I thought that I had to pay the same amount for all the next episodes. That's way overpriced, I thought, and with no knowledge of checking the forums or with no Steam friends to ask, I just uninstalled and forgot about it.After some months when all the 5 episodes came out, I realized that I actually don't have to pay for them separately and can play them all at once. I immediately installed the game and played from start to finish in one sitting (~6 hours). I think that's the only proper way to play these Telltale games. Wait for all the episodes to come out, then play it. Unfortunately it will be extremely difficult to commit to this since spoilers and curiosity might ruin the wait.

												Oh man, the characters and story is so much better and keeps you way more involved than you think it would. It’s up there with the first season of The Walking Dead tv series before it devolved into a sh*tty soap opera in its later seasons. I’m hoping season 2 and 3 of the game doesn’t make the same mistakes the tv series made.  Apparently this is based on the comic book universe and not the tv series universe, so any main characters you run into in this like (SPOILER)…..Glenn, is the Glenn from the comic book universe.Things are constantly happening and escalating which keeps tension high and you slightly on edge throughout, you just know something f*cked up is about to happen most of the time. It’s not like the tv show where there were a lot of filler episodes in the later seasons. There’s 5 episodes in the game, and one DLC episode each lasting around 2 hours in length. Each episode has you go to a different area, so your surrounding environment is always different. The DLC episode 400 days is way too short, and seems to be only for introducing characters that will be in season 2.The characters in this are really great, Lee and Clementine being the two standouts. The writing, character interactions and voice acting all comes across as authentic and better written than the tv series.Don’t be fooled by the cartoony aesthetic for the game, this is maybe the darkest and depressingly bleak game I have ever played (in a good way), or at least finished. The ambient and sombre musical scores really add to it as well. Episode 3 is especially f*cked up, putting you in situations and having you make choices you REALLY don’t want to make (“quack”, if you’ve played it you know what I mean by that). This game is the definition of giving you the feels, getting to you in an emotional way which many games and other types of media like tv or films even fail to do most of the time.Saying all of that though, the actual “game” elements are severely lacking. I know it’s a point and click game, but they have you do the most basic searching and puzzle solving you could think of in a game. Example being, you need to find a pencil, and when you go to “look” in the RV that’s literally the only thing you can interact with, there’s no choices, or other objects to pick up. Most of the time it will be telling you to find a weapon, and there’s only one weapon there, there was only once or twice where it actually let you choose between different weapons. Also the overall narrative only has one trajectory, you will always end up in the same place, at a certain moment one character will always die, you get to choose who lives and dies, but later on if that character dies and you wonder if you had chosen the other person instead, would it have turned out differently?…..it doesn’t. The choices you make and dialogue options you choose may affect your appearance or how certain characters treat you, but overall it’s the same story whatever you choose.Luckily the characters and writing are strong enough to overcome those drawbacks. Is it worth you playing it instead of watching a walkthrough on youtube? I would say yes, depending on how you answer questions or who you side with, you can find out more about people in your group so it has some replay value in that sense, and your playthrough would be different enough that it’s worth playing. Also when it’s actually you clicking a button to smash a zombies head in, or making tough emotional decisions, you are way more invested in the outcome than when you are a passive observer.

												This is a pretty unique game, the focus is not on the gameplay, shooting, action or whatsoever, the key element is the story here. Interesting characters guide your way through the zombie apocalypse and your choices have a big impact, not just on their relationship with you, but lives may depend on you! Character development is done really well in this one. You can actually relate to some people from the game and careful with the emotions...It's a nice break from all the run and shoot games, if you're in for an amazing story, then go play this one! :)			",79,27,0,3,3,0,1

												Without any doubt this is the best ""interactive movie"" i've ever played. The story is so great that keeps you playing hours in row wanting it never to come to an end. It's as creepy as emotional. You get to choose your own fate. Depending on your actions - you can make people like you or hate you. There are a lot of tough decissions to make, and you dont have a lot of time to think, there are just a few seconds, and you must decide instinctively. Episodes keep evolving better and better till, eventually, you wake up being entirely in their world, linked with the characters, and struggling for survival as you would in real life.

												This game was incredible to play. Every choice, response and action that you do or do not do affects what happens next and can be devastating or rewarding. I played this game using headphones, in the quiet so I could immerse myself completely into this game and it was amazing. It was nothing what I expecting when I loaded up the game, it's not all kicking Zombie♥♥♥♥♥ but progressing with your companions, earning their trust and unavoidantly - destroying it too. There were some jumpscares and a gruesome scene (at least for my choice anyway) near the end of the story and it was rather shocking. The whole last chapter pretty much had me tense, assuming I knew what was coming. Midway when I finally got Clem, everything was falling apart. The last scene is rather heartbreaking and properly had those water molecules flowing from my eyes, it was too much and was expertly crafted.The music alone makes this game amazing. From intense scenes to almost silence. Without the Music and sound effects I don't think this game would have been half as immersive as it is. Can't wait to buy Season 2. If you haven't played this game yet, you're missing out, big time.			",154,22,7,17,13,2,15

												I was hugely recommended The Walking Dead and completed it in full in 11 hours over the course of 3 days.First of all, The Walking Dead is great fun and tells a compelling and interesting story. However, it is not a game, and I refute anyone who states that it is.The Walking Dead is an interactive movie with control elements. There are very, very basic actions you can partake in, but to call that a ""game"" is insulting to gaming. It's a very well made interactive story, like a cross between a movie and game.My criticisms on this title would be that the conversational options are not ""free"". The game is very very much on rails, regardless of what you say and do you will end up in the same place, but things will be slightly different. I made a mistake by playing this directly after Alpha Protocol (the king of choice-based play) and drew me into comparing the two constantly, which negatively affected my enjoyment of the game. So, don't do that.Otherwise, a great, polished and enjoyable experience. Looking forward to the next chapters!Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												I bought this game because I love the tv series ""The Walking Dead"" and its really similar. There are alot of dialogues in the game where you have to give answers. The answer you choose changes the whole gameplay... its a bit like in reallife: When you say something stupid or you lie and they notice it... everything changes... And you can't go back in time. :D There are also fights in the game with zombies and you have to search solutions... for example how you can save someone who is catched in a house with some zombies infront of the house when you have no weapon. ^^ I really like this game. I just miss Daryl. ♥ So I will buy the second game of TWD too. :D			",224,60,10,20,8,0,13

Posted: August 8, 2016
												The central premise to this game is that you get to make important choices, and those choices change the outcome of the game.  It's like a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  The problem is, your choices DON'T change the game.  You can spend the whole game trying to keep someone alive, but they will still die.  You can repeatedly try to leave someone behind to be eaten by zombies, but they will keep surviving.  It's frustrating while you play, and it gets more and more frustrating the further you get.You are also never allowed to be reasonable or diplomatic with the NPCs.  You are constantly forced into situations where you have to ""pick a side"" in some pointless, idiotic argument over nothing, which is the game's way of forcing you to unnaturally alienate your incredibly thin skinned companions.  Not that it matters, because again, when they help you, when they betray you, and when they die, is all pre-determined, and you cannot change it.So basically the game is a huge jerk off.

												What A GAME!... Brilliant story, interesting characters... Sound, voice acting, art style, direction, music, gameplay... Everything is SO incredibly good that words can't describe all the experience of playing this game.From the very beginning the story catches you and you feel attached to Clementine and survival becomes even more important because of her. All characters are very well written, all of them will build some connection with you, letting the fate of the group in your hands and making you take the (hard) decisions that will affect all the story.The gameplay is pretty simple and works very well, the puzzles aren't that hard but all of them are very well designed. The greatest thing in the gameplay is the timer on the choices you have to make, it keeps the tension on the story.It IS a masterpiece and you must play it. Even if you don't like zombies.

												This game has such an amazingly gripping story, it left me with the feeling of needing more. It's so easy to get attached to the characters and there are so many emotional twists and turns, some of which are unexpected, that it never seems to get old or dull. The gameplay itself is decent, the controls are sometimes a bit unclear, but they're easy to get the hang of after an hour or so of playing. I recommend this game to anyone, even those that aren't fans of The Walking Dead comic or TV series. The story alone will have you at the edge of your seat and wanting to finish the game in one sit-down.			",178,43,2,29,20,2,16

												I absolutely reccomend this game, even if you never watched the series.When I started this game I was affraid that it was going to be one of those extremely predictable zombie games again, but it wasn't, it's far from predictable.The character development is amazing, you really get to know everyone you meet in the game and get either attached to them or despise them, you will find yourself doing anything to help one character sometimes.The story often takes unexpected turns which keeps the game interesting, and near the end it gets pretty emotional....really emotional, I hade to wipe some tears from my face when I saw the ending, sad but amazing, when the credits rolled after the last episode I cried, something I normally never do.So yes, this is absolutely one of the best games I've ever played, maybe even THE best in terms of storytelling			",325,83,6,17,21,3,35

												Neither Horror nor Adventure have ever really been my genre. But I got several friends who kept recommending this game, so I finally got it some days ago and just finished playing through it. The story is amazing and will just make you sink into it. It's an exciting and emotional adventure from the very first to the very last minute. There is so much more I want to say, but I don't want to risk to spoil anything.From all games I have ever played, this is the one I regret most to not have played earlier – and there have been many!

												So much to say, the first of which is that THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS!  If I mention anything specific, it is only a fabricated example.  That being said, let's start with the technical stuff, which is based off of the keyboard/mouse PC gameplay.I should also mention that I've never seen the TV series, nor read the comic series that this game is based upon.  I have read that this game follows a different set of characters, so you don't have to worry about spoilers via crossovers.MOVEMENT:  W-A-S-D or Arrow keys.FIGHTING:  Q and E keysSAVING/PAUSING/LOADING:There is no option to save -- it's automatic.  Watch for a swirl of lines in the top right corner.  This is the game saving your progress.  If you exit the game or go back to the main menu, you will lose anything you've done since the last auto-save.To pause the game, just hit the Escape key.  You'll go right back to where you left off (even in the middle of a conversation) when you continue.THE ZOMBIES:These are not the running, jumping, climbing, can-almost-think-type of zombie that you see in the movies as of late.  What we have in The Walking Dead are the more classic-style of the undead.  They shamble, barely have the coordination to stand upright.  They're slow because their bodies are rotting away.  They will never stop coming. There seem to be three things they react to:  Sight, sound, and a ravenous hunger for living flesh. To fight off the undead, rapidly hit the Q key when you see the prompt on the screen, and be ready to hit the E key to attack as soon as the prompt pops up.  Sometimes you'll have to use the mouse to aim an attack, and that's not as easy as you may think!  During fighting scenes the cursor can be hard to move around.  Make no mistake, this is definitely intentional, and a brilliant decision by the development crew.  It really adds to the reality and intensity of the situation, further immersing you in the story.YOUR CHOICES WILL AFFECT THE WAY THE PLOT OF THE GAME.  You're told this each time you start a new chapter of the game, and it's absolutely true.  Not only do your choices carry over from one chapter to another, but also to new seasons.  We play as a man named Lee, and WE choose what his personality is like.  Is he angry and defiant?  Calm and caring?  Some combination of the two?  That's entirely up to YOU, and it will affect how the other characters interact with you.There is not a lot of fighting, as one might expect from a title about zombigeddon.  Yes, of course we struggle, we shoot, we flee, and sometimes we die... but the primary thrust of the game is the story.  This is like no adventure game I've ever seen, seeming more like we're part of a movie, rather than playing a game.In tense situations, as in real life, we don't have an unlimited amount of time to decide what to say or do.  We have to make some snap decisions, and it heightens the immersiveness, wrapping around our psyche, taunting, calling, making us unable to stop thinking about what's happened, and what WILL happen because of our choices.The way interactions and inventory are handled are much different than I'm used to.  You can see small icons that show your inventory on the left-hand side of the screen, but you don't do the usual ""click on inventory item, then click on the scene"" routine.  Instead, when you mouse-over a hotspot on the scene, you will see options that you can choose from (assuming that there's more than one action available.)  If it's possible to try an inventory item on that spot, you'll see it in the options.  Just use your mouse wheel or arrow keys on your keyboard to highlight your desired choice; same as you do when you're having a conversation or choosing an action to take.This is not the kind of game where you can speed up the dialogue or skip cutscenes.  The Walking Dead is all about experiencing the story, and what a story it is!  Intense, gripping, distressing, touching.  Through all of the turmoil and strife, there are still moments that made me smile; even laugh out loud!  The only other game I've seen that evoked so much emotion was Cognition, though of course for entirely different reasons.SIGHTS & SOUNDS:You can see from the screenshots that the characters are done graphic art-style.  Not surprising since this is based off a comic book series.  And yet... deep within the gameplay, there are startling moments when the characters look real.  I would swear that they had live actors doing the modelling.  The mannerisms are so well done, the nuances of expression so poignant.  A slight softening of the eyes, the ghost of a smile... Beautifully done!There is some gore, but it's tolerable... and to be expected!  This IS a game featuring the dead, after all!  I have one friend who is not into zombies at all, and another who really can't stand gore, and both were so completely sucked in by the story that they couldn't stop playing!The music is so perfectly melded with the situations you encounter that they're well-nigh unnoticeable.  There is nothing to jar you out of the the environment, nothing to distract you from the situation you're in.The voice acting is absolutely superb.  Of course there are some exceptions, but very few.THE VERDICT:If you haven't figured out how I feel about the game by now, you must have skipped over the rest of the review!  There's been a lot of hype about the game, and it's all -- in my opinion -- very well-deserved. If you're looking for complex gameplay, this isn't for you.  Likewise if you're looking for a lot of combat or a shoot 'em up.  The Walking Dead isn't a game; it's an experience like no other, and one I highly recommend to anyone who loves a good story.I am dying to play Season 2 -- No, not literally!  Leave my brains intact, please! -- but for now, will have to settle for playing the game through for the third time :D			",520,548,5,64,35,4,42

												I would really like to recommend this game, because I very much enjoyed playing through it and the atmosphere was fantastic, but I can't. Why? Because the main point this game advertises is that your choices matter, it even says ""The story is tailored by how you play."". Unfortunately it's a big lie, whenever you can make an impactuful decision, the game will just correct course so it will go in purely linear fashion. Refuse to go somewhere? The group will outvote you (even though they normally never vote on anything). Have a situation which can result in a character living or dying? If you saved that person, that person will die very soon anyways. A choice between saving character A or character B? You can consider the character that you saved dead anyways. It's just a lazy work by developers. Only some dialogue choices are referenced later, but even those sometimes feel out of place or are just wrong (for example 1 character saying ""we"" about himself in last chapter, because it was not predicted he could be alone).

												The must buy for every Walking Dead fan. It's not based on the tv series. It's based on the comics and there are few cameos from those as well. Keep in mind that this game is not all about blasting thousands of zombies away. It's stories about survival and the people. In this game you have to make hard choices, usually all them have some pros and cons and will haunt you later in the game. It's a great game and this game truly is tailored by the choices made. There are even really surprising twists, which sometimes make you think that you should have done it the other way. But that's what makes this game so great. It has a great plot and all the episodes are out. So what are you waiting for? Grab it and see zombie apocalypse from the point of casual people trying to survive rather than a single hero surviving and slaying hundreds. Just warning tho, this game isn't a fairy tale. It's really depressing, but in a good way if you can say that.			",238,32,8,16,17,2,27

I hate zombie games and other zombie related stuff...And i loved this game!Dead Block, Dead Pixels, Dead Head Fred, Dead Effect, Dead Island, Dead Nation, Dead Rising, Deadlight, Dead Space, Dead State...Zombies should be only in RPGs where necromancers brought 'em back to walk on Earth. At least that would make sense. OK, having couple of zombie games is fine...But this is out of hand! I don't understand why people keep eating this s**t up. Most zombie games, like 3/4, are not even mediocre! They're downright horrible!This game tho. This game right here. This, this is a masterpiece. The storytelling, voice acting, character development, the music...It's all so very well done.If you're a bit more sensitive then you will cry...A LOT. The game does a great job of keeping the story intense at all times. You just can't wait to see what happens next.There's not much gameplay but that's fine in my opinion. We play adventure games for the story and this is why i like TellTales new take on the adventure genre. The formula they have in their latest titles is just so perfect for storytelling!The gameplay is there tho. Some quick time events, a bit of walking and picking up items...That's pretty much it.I recommend using a controller and playing while sitting on a couch 'cus you want to sit back and enjoy the story...Like you're watching a good movie. A long movie.Took me about 10h to finish the entire game. That's about 2h per chapter. That's like a length of a full ""The Walking Dead"" season. Only that this one is actually good and has a gripping story.This is one of the few zombie games i recommend getting. There's not many original zombie games out there so getting a rare pearl like this is pretty much a must for every gamer. ",707,129,45,70,35,10,64

												Looking back at this game, makes me feel pretty sad tbh fam. It makes me want to simply hit my head and forget all that happened in this one joy of a ride. As much as I do a lot of crappy reviews, I think this was like the first game that made me like the point and click genre. It pulls you in with an amazing story and it never felt rushed. The characters were each played so well, and it makes you sympathize with some of them. (Let me hug Clementine pls.) The episodes were correctly played up to par and it made me want more. Never have I ever felt so much more anticipation on what seems to be a simple game. This game does have what it takes to be an emotional ride, and wish TellTale would make more masterpieces like this. Overall, I would most absolutely recommend this to anyone, and it is a must buy for all gamers. You would have a hell of a time.			",118,21,4,12,3,0,3

												To get acquainted with The Walking Dead: The Game costs, only if at you everything is all right with knowledge of English, and you perceive dialogues as important need, instead of silly chatter between fights. After all the zombie apocalypse in The Walking Dead: The Game — only scenery, some kind of shelter in which the main character should ""be grazed"". The gloomy picture against which the present drama of the relations is played. The plot of ""A New Day"" covers the first days of infection. Those which Ric Grayms (the main character of the comic book and series) safely carried out in a coma. But, as well as in the original, large-scale scenes of an apocalypse stayed behind scenes. Patrol cars carrying by by, the helicopter which has flown over the head, and rare firing in the distance — here and all doomsday. We will hide in the thrown houses, to wander about Hershel's farm (one more character, the acquaintance according to the comic book and series), to barricade in the shop which was once belonging to parents of Li Everett... In each of scenes you learn something new about the past of the main character and his little companion. The relations of the child and Li who involuntarily became ""nurse"" — a keynote of all series. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			",82,13,5,9,4,0,5

THE WALKING DEAD, SEASON 1Wow! What a grand Interactive TV show that is better than the rest!By and large, most choice-driven games have followed the same formula, inviting you to make your mark in the world by deciding if you want to be “good” or “bad,” and accepting the binary nature of existence. But in the post-apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead, where the dead walk the decaying earth, the notion of good and bad is somewhat dated. There’s no “right” when right can mean shooting an innocent child before it can turn into a flesh-eating beast, and there’s no “wrong” when wrong can mean stealing the supplies you need to survive from those just as needy as you. The Walking Dead is the story of the choices you can’t live with, and the choices you can, coming together to create an experience as depressing and pessimistic as it is remarkable and memorable. This game will linger like a good book.Zombies with a great storyIn stark contrast to the rest of gaming, The Walking Dead is more focused on what you do than how you do it. There aren’t many traditional puzzles as much as there are tasks that you’re asked to perform to move the story forward. Menial activities like finding batteries for a radio or starting up a train aren’t all that engaging by themselves, but they serve a very necessary pacing purpose, as well as give you a chance to explore the world a bit and get to know the characters better. If you’re looking to rampage around Georgia blasting the heads off of undead monsters, you’re better getting one of the many other zombie games on the market. L4D comes to mind.Compaired to the other Interactive gamesI have played many interactive types of video games and WDS1 IS THE BEST! No doubt about it. Very satisfying.AND REMEMBER: A Zombie outbreak could be prevented if people were buried with their shoe laces tied together. :D ",124,12,0,8,12,0,16

												If there's a genre I avoid like the plague (excuse pun!), it's zombies - so I've really not even bothered reading reviews about The Walking Dead - my mistake right there.  So, here I am reeling from a game with quite possibly more feels in it than the entire legendary series of Mass Effect (pure videogame blasphemy, that).  Yet, I was only tempted into buying The Walking Dead by its namesake Pinball FX2 table where scoring choices declared that I'd chosen to 'save' one person or another (I just wanted to find out what all that was about...).  How mistaken I was to think this was some kind of zombie FPS!For fellow gamers who hate zombies, let me put this out there: this game is not actually about zombies.  With a title of ""The Walking Dead"" and a zillion screenshots of, well, zombies - I might sound like I'm off my rocker here, but no.  An unexplained disease outbreak has suddenly taken place (you never get to find out what, how or why in the game) which results in the dead returning to devour the flesh of anything they can grab (yep, sounds suspiciously zombie-like, doesn't it?) but this is really just the backdrop to the storyline.  The backdrop event could equally be about a nuclear holocaust, or some killer virus outbreak (kinda not far off this story actually).  It is the events caused by this cataclysmic, life-changing backdrop that you play through.  The game is a story-rich masterpiece about survival.  You will constantly be presented with moral choices and difficult dilemmas.  Do you trust fellow survivors or not?  Do you depend on them?  Do you let a threat live?  Do you let compassion rule over logic?  Do you be honest or withold the brutal truth from a child?  In truth, you might do a little of all these things because this is a game with very few rights versus wrongs.  There is little point flipping through walk-throughs in hope of pursuing the perfect game.  It simply doesn't work like that.  You will be presented with tear-jerking choices where neither is great, but you HAVE to choose.  Heartbreaking moments surface throughout - so all but the most hardened of players might appreciate a box of Kleenex by their side!  This game is very much the 8-person lifeboat scenario where you forever always seem to have 9 people.  Who goes?  YOU decide.  But not everyone can live happily ever after and life is not always fair...I don't know how true to the comics the game happens to be, but I will say that the characters were very easy to care about (even the dislikeable ones had a story), the artwork is novel and effective (somehow 3D without losing the water-colour comic essence), and the haunting melodic music throughout sets the tone for the dark storyline perfectly.  The game plays well with both keyboard/mouse and gamepad and doesn't require a ninja PC to play it (which is always nice).  There are no pointless 'collectibles' missions to detract from the story and no quick-save options to dilute the pressure of the instant-decision process (though for busy people it is never-the-less possible to rewind back to an earlier point if part of the story is missed).  For anyone who enjoys a great story-driven adventure built strongly upon the choices you make throughout each episode, this game is the real deal.  If you want a game where what you do really seems to matter, and where a few shocks and anguishes won't be too distressing, then I highly recommend this game.			",238,117,21,21,132,3,67

												A powerful story I got to experience, not just observe.In an era of games about survival, The Walking Dead examines both your heart and mind, not just your trigger finger.Will you protect yourself from threats by any means or will you try to keep your humanity? Who will you help and who will you hurt? Sometimes, even if you do your best, the worst will still come afterwards. While not a fan of the TV series and never having read the comics, I found myself immediately immersed in the world of this game and connected with the different characters. It felt like I had to think and react in near real time. The choices I could make were often far from ideal and the conflict affected me deeply. At times my heart was lifted and many it was broken. A brilliant story with gameplay that isn't about winning, but introspection. I don't feel I can say more than what's been said about this game by others, just add myself to the collective of people who think they experienced something exceptional. Any perceived flaws are slight blemishes that can be easily looked past due to the many highlights this game offers and the total refinement of the story, in my opinion.			",138,42,1,6,8,0,6

												It is hands-down the best story-driven game i have played to this day.It does not have a long story but in that short amount of time you play this game you get extremely involved with the characters and have to make some really tough choices you sometimes even regret.Definitely the deserved winner of the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye”-Award!No doubt a 10/10.

												I don't write reviews. I feel it's a waste of time and effort but I felt a need to do one for The Walking Dead.The stylized graphics look really great to me. For the times I noticed it, the music is great and perfectly matches what you're looking at. Gameplay is your typical point and click but with keyboard movement controls and QTEs thrown in which works well. All these make for a mediocre game if not for the story which is what makes this game the masterpiece that it is.All that being said, I hate this game. I only recommend this to get as many people as possible to suffer with me.The game will constantly put you in situations you do not want to be in and force you to make hard decisions. Many times I wanted to stand up and walk away but the game will suck you in and compel you to keep going through its many screwed-up events. We're talking about ""A Song of Ice and FIre"" level of screwed-up. You find yourself loving the characters and hating some but one thing you won't be able to do is be indifferent. Even the most passive gamer would find him/herself emotionally invested. I was an unwilling participant and fought as hard as I could against the poignant and visceral feelings the game stirs up but broke down at the very end.I play games for amusement and entertainment, I was neither amused nor entertained but was powerless to stop myself from seeing the game through. The last time I felt this way was when I watched ""Grave of Fireflies"" the first time and I had to watch reruns of Modern Family and Big Bang Theory over the next few days to recover. I am currently steeling myself before firing up Season 2 and was advised to get Tales From the Borderlands as a possible antidote after.TL;DR: A masterpiece. 10/10. Will never play again. Play it and taste bitter regret afterwards. Avoid if depressive, do not play if suicidal. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is truly amazing. I as a fan of the series, could not miss it. It is much heartier and more severe than the TV series. I was very happy that the game is sustained in the style of comics, as it is a little smooths everything. Stunning heroes, great music, great views. This interactive story will not leave anyone indifferent, even those who don't like zombie game, and those who do not like this genre. Each character has its own character, you get used to them, you miss them experience (even minor). The game will sometimes makes decisions so quickly that you regret about his spontaneous choice. The game makes upset, angry, and sometimes even turn away from what is happening on the screen. It includes an excellent drama and the spooky horror. All series and even the seasons are related to your previous decisions, which gives full sense of immersion and responsibility for your decisions, whatever they may be. you will not be disappointed1. Потрясающий сюжет, заставляющий переживать за всех героев и полностью быть в их шкуре в самых диких ситтуациях, и переживать как они.2. Отличное музыкальное сопровождение. Музыка и нагнетает атмосферу, где нужно, и заставляет чуть ли не слезу пустить в драматичных моментах.3. Хоть игра и выполнена в виде комикса, жестяка и суровости в ней намного больше, чем в сериале, и драмы больше в десятки раз. Играл я после сериала, и неожидал на сколько игра меня проймёт. За душу берёт местами сильно и так же сильно иногда заставляет отвернуться от экрана или разозлиться на ситтуацию и на выбор.4. Игра сделана в стиле интерактивного сериала. Приходится принимать решения быстро и изменить их больше нельзя, вы будете переживать за свои ошибки, я уверен. Также ваши решения переходят от серии к серии и даже во второй сезон.5. Рекомендую не спойлерить себе и играть спонтанно. Даже плохие решения по началу могут вылиться в хороший итог в дальнейшем. Играйте от души и от эммоций. Игра не ведётся на РПГшные выкрутасы, ВЫ НИКОГДА не выйдете сухим из воды Игра из серии MUST HAVE. Даже если не любите сериал, зомби тематику или такой жанр игр как интерактивка, всё равно сыграйте ради сюжета, вы не пожалеете			",2726,1124,108,322,419,45,474

Product received for free
												The Walking Dead is a game point and click genre of horror based on the comics of the same name created by Robert Kirkman. Since the game was developed and published by Telltale Games with release date on 24 April 2012. In fact, the game itself can be considered an ""interactive cinematic"" where more watch than play, but even so it does not takes the most important sense: decisions.We must face many difficult and very stressful situations, perhaps the time is regarded as the greatest enemy that the player can have. After all, every choice is a totally different answer and even when we remain silent (there is the ""..."" or when the time runs out choice) it might mean something. Can strengthen friendships or create enemies, but perhaps what is more cruel to anyone who plays or is the explicit violence, for the most part, but the decision of who should help. In the beginning, all are strangers and it's just a game any, but as time passes you can know them better and to create affection for each of them or even depending on the situation you can create anger and try everything to take revenge someone who was bad for both you, Lee Everett, and for Clementine. This tie the player creates with the main characters is something indescribable and eventually becomes so strong that at times you might end up crying. When walking story, choices as who stays and who goes, and who enters the group may be common and really dangerous, after all are not what they claim to be.The game's story is quite cliche, try to survive in a world full of zombies, and despite all the harm they caused, can not compare to what humans can do to satisfy your survival instinct. But the game can develop the plot in a way that I consider exquisite, creating a differential and an incredible depth, highlighting even more the series and comic.Things that caught my attention in particular:- Trama completely engaging and full of twists.- Striking characters and well worked, mostly.- The quality of animation is equivalent to the designer of the comic.- The choices affect the continuation of the game.- Great emotional load that can affect the player an indescribable way, the amazing thing is that we end up creating a special affection by the protagonists.TWD no doubt is a remarkable and unforgettable game with an amazing story and simple gameplay. Perhaps the only game of the problem is the lack of difficulty, but perhaps this is more a matter of accessibility and so those who want to just ""see"" can take the course also, without fear of ""suffering"". What I find most impressive is how this game can shake the sentimental and the ease that he has to become admired by those who have the pleasure of playing. There should be no doubt why the game has won the GOTY in 2012, after a masterpiece like this should receive their deserved recognition.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.

												when i first played this game ( episode 1) i was like what is this game ?!! lol looks dumb (first time i ever heard of the walking dead also Telltale ) boy was i wrong,30 min after that i was like HELL i need the second episode ASAP ( had to wait a month for the second episode to come out) now good thing you got the full game + the dlc ( took me 20 h to complete it without the dlc) .- first of all the plot : (the best thing you get in this game) the story is divided to 5 episodes ( back in 2012 you had to wait and pay for each episode but now you get the whole thing ) your decisions and choices will affect the main plot event in season 2 which i think its the best thing you can ask in a video game ( cause it feels like you're actually live the story not just playing ) also there is not right or wrong , bad or good decisions you just have to do what you think is best ( like in real life) ohh you will meet some people from the TV show like glenn and hershel.- graphically : the devs choices to make the game looks like a 3D/comic art style ( like in the comics i guess ) witch is great considering the origin of the game .-now the gameplay : like any other point and click game you walk with WASD and the mouse to look around and to select or grab stuff + QTE when it comes to fight ( sometimes to gotta be quick making decision)-sound: perfect voice acting ( really get in to you when the game gets emotional) + a lot of dialogue , music and sound effects are great .-no multy of course ( duhhh) but after each episode , the game with compare your choses to other players around the world and show you the statistics so you can see how people played games like this one ( also in the end of the game)-bugs or glitches : sometimes characters and items glitches in the game and sometimes they becomes invisible but doesn't crash or block the progression in the game( maybe something to do with windows 10 or my pc who knows).-achievements : 48 easy achievements for achievements hunters like myself ( story related you just have to play the game to unlock them) 40 from the main game and 8 from the dlc so make sure to get it to complete everything.-steam trading cards.finally, i highly recommend this game for anyone that wants a good storytelling game worth the money ( i warn you you gonna cry :3) or make sure to grab it on sales (around 4.99$ - 7$) if its too much for you and dont forget the dlc because it adds some extra to the story and you will need it in S2.9/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												Genre: AdventureThe game is based on the comic book series from Robert Kirkman and plays in the months following a zombie apocalypse. You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer, who was on his way to prison, when the zombie apocalypse starts. In your adventure you meet a lot of different characters, including one known from the movie series. The most important of this characters is Clementine, a little orphaned girl, that you defend on your journey throughout the game.You have to make a lot of tough decisions in this game and the cool thing is that at the end you can see how the other gamers decided to play the game.From the storytelling part this is probably one of the best games in the last years.Positive:+ very good storytelling+ nice comicstyle graphics+ good voice actors+ breathtaking moments+ you make decisions, that influence the game in a way...Negative:- ... but in the end don't matter that much- episode format means that you have to wait some months to play the next chapter (outdated, as the game is completely available)In the end this is a very great game and a must play for every fan of adventures, zombie stories and i recommend everybody else just to try it out. It is worth it. Fun gameplay: ca. 14 hoursAchievements:Type: PlayingDifficulty: Very EasyTime needed: Little			",1237,476,53,178,162,20,248

												This game flourished off the back of the success of the TV series, but it's every bit as enjoyable and well made in its own right. I'm one of the people who enjoyed the comic and the early series' of The Walking Dead more because they were more about the decisions and choices the characters make in different situations and scenarios and helped to show that human nature is an ugly beast, but very complex and interwoven, and never black and white. The video game facilitates this same process- showing the results of our different choices and decisions through the characters, and because you're playing one of those characters and vested in their outcome, everything that affects the world affects you on an emotional level.When it came out it was a somewhat unique gameplay mechanic for Point & Click Adventure games, and it's still limited- most choices don't actually affect the world or the linear story, yet it absolutely reaches you and makes the story and the things happening on screen more vivid and real.

												At the first sight, this was a game that didn't interest me, but the day I decided to give a try... I could not have been more astounded by how wondrous this game truly is, I was sucked into this story driven phenomenon instantly. It is not focused a lot on gameplay, let alone on random zombie killing, but rather character development, and the deep story of Lee Everett and Clementine. This game is dark and emotional, you'll have many tough, important, and tense choices to make throughout your journey, with usually a very limited amount of time on them. On top of all this the game is long, you'll spend a large amount of hours to beat this diamond. This is easily Telltale's magnum opus, and worth every single penny. 9.7/10.0 ",332,52,17,28,17,1,21

												This is a preliminary review, since I'm only 1.5 hours into the game and haven't finished episode 1 yet.Let me start off by saying that I really don't care for anything involving zombies, with the exception of two things: Shaun of the Dead[www.imdb.com] and Left 4 Dead 2. And both of these things I like in spite of the zombies, and not because of them. Other than that, I just plain don't like zombies, and I'm well and thoroughly sick of them crossing over into every medium and genre imaginable. So it means something when I say that The Walking Dead overcomes my zombie hate easily and gets to be the third exception.As an adventure game, so far, TWD is no challenge. In fact, I've only stopped because I just hit the first ""puzzle"" I couldn't immediately solve, and that's probably just because I overlooked something. Gameplay is a mix between point and click, dialogue trees and the occasional quick time event. For those of you who hate QTEs (as well you might): the QTEs presented here are telegraphed well in advance and require little timing skill, so they actually enhance the immersion rather than breaking it from having to replay them over and over again, which is the major problem I have with QTEs.The appeal here is the story and not the gameplay, and the way it draws you in is masterfully done. Characters are introduced and you're given reasons to care for them (either positively or negatively) with a minimum of exposition and infodumping -- and that includes you, the protagonist. At the same time, it's clear that the story is driven by you and your actions, and you're not just clicking through to the next cutscene. Does every choice you make matter? Probably not. Is the game adept at making you think it does? Very.That's all I can say after 1.5 hours -- but if the rest is as good as what I've already seen, you should absolutely pick this up if you don't mind your games having more story than challenging gameplay. If you play games more for the elements of competition and challenge, though, this game's not going to satisfy you. Likewise, if you're into zombies for the gore or horror, this one probably won't excite you -- blood, severed limbs and strong language are not avoided, but they're not the focus. As interactive entertainment, though, this is great stuff.			",136,36,1,17,7,2,27

Telltale The Walking Dead: Season One ReviewWhen looking at the Steam awards and was told to choose a game that I wasn't expecting the tear up at, I naturally thought of this game. Telltale has tailored this game almost perfectly with twists, horror, sad moments and of course, decision making. I'm also writing this review because I am in love with this game and I would like to say why.The game allows you to make decisions that can potentially make all the difference later on. Having played through this game several times, I've noticed that even something you say early on in the game can make a difference to a coversation with a character later on. Your decisions will affect the opinions other characters have on you, which makes you feel involved. Personally, I prefer the game over the TV series and comics. I may well be a minority for it but the reason being is that I feel more involved in the story, which makes me care more for the characters. Making choices on who to save will make an impact on character relationships. I don't think Telltale got enough credit for their detail in characters such as Clementine, Lee, Carley, Doug, Kenny etc. I'm glad Telltale took their own route and made their own character's for their Telltale series. When I began to play this game a few years back, I had very little knowledge on what the game was about. I brought the game because I liked the concept of the decision making. If I could go back and play it again without any knowledge of the game, I would. I want this experience again.Keep that hair short.			",600,180,17,63,59,5,52

												At this point, everyone should know what The Walking Dead is. The original comics. The legendary TV series at AMC. The dreadful Activision game and the point-and-click Walking Dead game. This game is very different from other video games as it relies more on storytelling, dialogue choices, quick decision making, and interactive mechanics like the Humongous Entertainment games when I was a toddler. I am one of the ""late"" gamer who just purchased this game during the 2014 Summer Sale. I already knew that the game did well, but I was not convinced that it is really that perfect. I was completely wrong. The first episode capture my attention and how dialogue choices can affect a player's emotion. You will feel happy when you pick the right choice. You will feel angry that your choice led to an utter disaster. You will feel sad when a character that you connect with fell apart. You will cry that you should had done something else. There is no doubt that The Walking Dead franchise is outstanding, but this game is, arguably, the best. I am very glad that I got this game and you should get this game too. Try this game out. It will convince you to continue playing until the last chapter in one playthrough.			",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												This game is brutal.Let me back up a little there. I saw the release of the game originally and expected it to be based on the first series of the TV show, not the graphic novels which I was unaware of, so I watched a few minutes of people streaming it then put it on my list of games to buy some time, no big hurry though. Then about a month ago I watched someone playing a while and remembered I wanted the game and lo and behold Steam put it on sale. I bought it.Sometimes I play a couple of hours of an FPS online and I get tired but it's a physical tiredness, The Walking Dead left me emotionally and mentally drained. The short time I watched people streaming it I laughed at their choices and told them how they were going wrong, armchair gaming, warrior style.  Now I have played it for myself I can see I was no better than the people I watched stream it, with my choices. This game is like interacting with a movie, the story is there but how you play it decides the outcomes of many situations and can decide the type of person you are, morality wise. When Kenny doesn't want to help me at the end of Chapter 4? I know I made some bad choices.I don't want to give any spoilers away, just play this game. Oh yeh, I said this game was brutal? If it doesn't punch you full on in the feels, you should check your pulse.			",103,31,5,3,11,4,4

												The Walking Dead is an excellent interactive story with believable characters, beautiful artwork, voice acting and music, and a powerful emotional impact.There are some puzzles to solve and zombies to kill, but mostly the game involves deciding what to do or say to the other characters during time-limited interactions that are often filled with tension. These decisions make the story feel like it is your own, allowing you to shape Lee and his relationship with Clementine and the other characters, and I felt this resulted in it having more of an impact on me than if I had watched it on TV.The characters are well developed and felt real, many becoming people for whom I cared (and still think about) and it hurt to see them suffer during what were intense and sometimes devastating scenes. Oftentimes I found myself questioning my decisions, regardless of how justifiable they seemed. But while the story is pretty grim at times, there are touching moments as well, particularly during the interactions with Clementine, who is the heart and soul of the game.Expect to get around 2-4 hours per episode depending if you inspect everything and exhaust all dialogue options. I enjoyed The Walking Dead, and it is easily one of the best games I have played.			",16,50,0,7,0,0,0

												First of all, I did not watch the Walking Dead TV series or read the comic books. So I bought this game without any expectation. Once I completely finished the whole game, I was blown away. The story line was near perfect.However, I would like to add that the Point and Click genre of this game is a bit rudimentary. The reason being, most (not all) of the choices a player makes does not really change the whole story line. This brings up another question. I hate to say this but in our current computer programming technology, the Point and Click genre is at its infancy. Perhaps in 10 or 20 years time, this genre will evolve into maturity and the story lines of this genre will be near diverse in nature.Perhaps in the future, our children and grandchildren might laugh at this game for being too rudimentary by the choices a player makes in the game. We shall see but currently, considering the limitation of computer programming, this is a great game though. However try to buy it when it is on sale. I would give this game 8 out of 10.

(This Will Be An On-going Review)I am not detailing what happens in each Episode but I am giving my Personal thoughts towards the Episode itself.Episode 1: Episode 1 literally had me clinging to my seat. The moment I layed eyes on Clementine. Wait, that sounds weird. The moment I gazed.. the Moment Clementine saved my life, I knew she was going to be my Favorite. She has shown that, she brings an Emotional and Heartfelt attitude towards the game. There is just something about her Character. The decisions that I made in the Episode I hope don't come back to get me in Episode 2. See you soon Clementine!Finished Episode 1 on 1/01/2017.Episode 2: So.. to explain my thoughts surrounding Episode 2. I cried. I feel as if I have let Clementine down, I don't know how I am going to tell her in Episode 3, if you actually do, what is on that Camcorder. I watched it. I actually had tears down my Face! This game draws you in, makes you fall in love with the Characters. You make such hard decisions, I made some that I am not proud of so far. But I have done everything in the best interest of Clementine. I actually have the sense of feeling as if she where my daughter, I swear, I am naming my first Daughter 'Clementine'!Finished Episode 2 on 1/01/2017.Episode 3: With everything that started happening it was leaving me Clueless. All I wanted to know who was the chick on the Radio, but Safe to say I actually have no idea. I am still certain it was Clementines Mother. I never told her about it. However; I did tell the group that I was headed for Jail on Day 1. I mean, honestly saved me to be honest. We have now witnessed the Death of 3 People. I literally cried all night, I couldn't cope. Like, why? Can we kill Ben for what he has done to the Group? You are on my Hitlist buddy - your skating on Thin Ice!May you Rest In Piece.. Duck, Khatja and Carley.Finished Episode 3 on 24/01/2017.Episode 4: Currently Not FinishedFinished Episode 4 on 00/00/2017.Episode 5: Currently Not FinishedFinished Episode 5 on 00/00/2017.(Special Episode) 400 Days: Currently Not FinishedFinished 400 Days on 00/00/2017.I am Currently doing a Youtube Let's Play, want to check it out?

												This game is phenomenal and powerful. Very few games take into account the consequence of your actions as seriously as The Walking Dead does. It is quite a bleak experience, don't expect things to be sugarcoated here, the walker threat is real and its impact is felt throughout the whole game.The voice acting is top notch, which is a good thing, since this game is entirely plot driven. The characters are all great, you're meant to love some, hate some, and be somewhere in the middle of the road with others. Everyone has their own shades of gray, and the game really sends home the message that morality is secondary when you're purely dealing with survival. Every choice has its outcome, and its advantage along with its disavantage. It's worth replaying just to see how different it can be simply due to the most minor of decisions that you may have taken. It will make you remember each and every ""yes"" and ""no"" you have given, whether you like it or not, and you'll feel the full weight of the hard decisions you'll have to do due to circumstances that are, at times, unavoidable, so tread carefully.It is a point and click adventure, yes, but not one that gives you obscure clues like some games of this genre do. I personally do not have much experience with point and clicks, and while at first I thought I'd have trouble navigating through it, or even being stuck, I did just fine. It has its quick-time event moments when things get more hectic, and I found it fit the game perfectly.This game was again, a powerful, emotional, and unforgettable rollercoaster ride. It also brings out the dad in you and I'll just leave it at that. I need to play Season 2. The Walking Dead belongs in everyone's favorite game list, and I urge you to play this if you haven't yet. You won't come out unchanged. ",858,258,31,163,96,14,179

Absolutely amazing game!This is one of these games you can get addicted to for hoourrs, the story is extremely ""gripping"" and you get so hooked to the characters!The characters in this game are just AMAZING, they are all special and unique in their own way! If you are like me a ""a dude with alot of feelings"" you will easily get attached to these characters.The graphics are cool too, nothing to complain about!The game is about 13-14 hours long and If you buy a DLC its around 2 hours longer. (I recommend getting the DLC because its good too)I finished this game for maybe a year ago [2015-12-14] and I still think of it, time to time. That shows that this game is really great! I still wanna replay this and I will do it someday!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^My RatingI easily give this game a 10 out of 10! Mainly because of the story but also because of the characters!

												One of the most engaging interactive adventures I have played! Incredibly strong writing & voice-acting give the narrative the focus & impact it needs maintaining a good pace through all 5 episodes.Choices made throughout the game have repercussions & vary the outcome of the story. They also give small timeframes to decide which adds significant intensity.Fans of the TV Show will get a little more from the story & locations as there is some crossover but its not a prerequisite to enjoy the game. You never know who is going to live or die, but unlike the TV Show here you atleast have input on who makes it & how it goes down.Emotional, memorable, heart-breaking, disturbing adventure set in a Zombie post-apocalyptic world.One of those must have experiences for any gamer!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

 This Is The Best Game I Have Ever Played.  This review doesn't contain any kind of information that is official or something like that. It only contains my opinion towards the game.  After playing this game over and over again, I noticed that there are some pros and cons about this game, and that's what I'm going to list in this review.  Pros  Comic Book Relief.   The game is based on the graphic novels of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard, Robert Kirkman being the writer of the '' The Walking Dead '' Comic Books. Besides having the same graphics, It also has the same environment and some of the characters of his series, like Glenn that appeared on the first episode.  Storyline.   The Walking Dead ( Game ) has one of the best storiess I have ever saw. Because It gives you several options on how do you want the game to keep going, you can either support Kenny's plan ( Find a boat ), Lilly's plan ( Stay at the Motor Inn ), Clementine's plan ( Find her parents when they get to Savannah ) or create your own plan as the game progresses.  Lovable Characters.   There are characters that stay with you until the end. Because of that, you kind of create a strong bond between you and the characters. Besides, in this game, You'll also see that there are a lot of different characters, the reason is that the game wants you to identify yourself with one of the characters. Immersion   Now, this part is going to sound weird, but when I finished playing episode 1 & 2, I started to really like Lee, Clementine and Kenny, because of that, I kind of saw me as being Lee. Every choice I did after those episodes, I felt that I was the one doing them, not Lee. This game, at some weird reason makes you become the character, as if you really were experiencing what is happening in the game.  Emotions   Because of the Immersion and the Lovable Characters that I mentioned before, The game really punishes your feelings with no mercy. I'm not going to talk a lot about this subject because I don't want to ruin your experience, because this is the best pro about the game, I'm just going to say 1 thing, don't stop yourself from experiencing this game, let yourself feel the game, create a bond between the characters you really like, immerse yourself into the game, stop holding it back.  Choices   Be careful to the choices you make. Your choices influence the game a lot, and not only this season, the choices you make here also influences the season 2 and 3 of the '' The Walking Dead '' game.  So be aware. I'm going to give you a tip, If you aren't clear about what to do, just pause the game pressing space ( Only works for season 2 & 3 ) or by pressing the '' Esc '' button, And just take a moment to think about what you'll choose. It'll help you not to make precipitated choices. Cons  Sorry, but there are no cons about this game.  And Clem, Keep That Hair Short. ~ Lee  ",90,31,2,5,4,0,6

Posted: April 3, 2015
												First, some insight on why I'm reviewing a game that is already considered ""Overwhelmingly Positive"", and somewhat ""old"". Simply put, I fell in love with this game, and I couldn't stop playing it until I finished my first playthrough. A friend of mine even called me crazy, but he was the one crying when he first played it.I just hope you, or anyone else that plays the game, enjoy the game as much as I did (and will, even more).Without any further delay, I present to you my review of The Walking Dead, season 1.GameplayYou control a character called Lee, who is a convicted felon, that murdered his wife's lover (wouldn't we all?), and soon you find yourself between a sword and a wall, when a little girl called Clementine comes to your rescue.The story between Lee and Clementine will be the center of TWD: S1, as you meet survivors, some more evil than others, who force you to make decisions that will tailor the game. In the end, you'll not only be crying, but also thinking, ""could I've done anything differently?"", ""could I've saved him/her?"". The answer is something you'll have to figure out on your own.The graphics are comic bookish, which sets a nice mood to the game, since The Walking Dead is, in fact, a comic book series.The soundtrack doesn't fall behind, as it feels both smoothing and terrifying, depending on the situation you're facing.Pros Well written story that captivates the player, making the player feel he's part of the story; A wide array of choices to help the player choose where his loyalty lies; Touching story (a box of tissues should be included with the purchase of the game); Captivating graphics; Thrilling sountrack; Amazing voice acting; Realistic display of emotions.Cons The menu sound is incredibly annoying and repetitive, good thing you don't spend much time there anyway; You can, sometimes, tell when a new ""clip"" starts, as there's tiny distance from the characters previous position; Despite the story being incredibly well written, and the dialogues pretty smooth, there are some parts where if you go back to talk to someone, they just basically say to each other: ""Hi"", ""Hi"", ""Bye"", ""Bye"". Would be easier to just disable the option to talk to them, like it happens on other bits of the story; I saw Katjaa holding Duck, and then for the next minute or so of the story, everytime she appeared she looked like she was holding something, but Duck wasn't anywhere to be seen (a friend of mine told me this also happened to him on a console playthrough).VerdictI'd give it a 10/10 as I feel none of the cons/bugs are game breaking, while having a brilliant and touching story.Note: I wouldn't call myself a fan of the series. I like it, I'll watch it if it's on TV, but it's not something I look forward to watch every week. I feel it got boring after a while. However, the game is a lot better than the series. But that's just my take on it.PS. I also cried.			",195,74,5,28,41,1,22

												I am a big fan of The Walking Dead TV series and this game brings The Walking Dead into a Game series perfectly. This game has a Story, Character Development, Walkers, Deaths and Drama, just what I love about The Walking Dead.You are Lee, a convicted murderer for the man your wife was cheating with. You are in a police car when it hits a walker on the road, the car spins into a forest and you wake up in the middle of a forest full with walkers, you don't know what they are but you climb over a wall into a garden, and there's a girl, Clementime, shes alone, orphaned by the apocalyse.You make it your job to look after her, to let anything happen to her.As for gameplay, most of the game is cutscenes, these don't get boring and you are involved the whole time, by choosing what your character says and the many quicktime events.The game changes on your choices in both of these events are comparable to Mass Effect.Outside these, there are parts of the game were you have to walk around and talk to people, walk through walkers and interative with objectives in a point and click 3D form.If you are a fan of the TV Series, Comic Series or just zombies in general, I recommend you get this game, there are 5 episodes in this Season and each will last nearly 2 hours each. Anyone will love this great Game Season.I give it a 10 out of 10 ",173,40,2,21,13,2,32

												Although I am a big fan of The Walking Dead, to playing this game I got for longer time. For the first time I saw the game on YouTube. Initially, the graphics has discouraged me, but this game confirms that sometimes it doesn't matter on it. You play all the time as a teacher and murderer Lee, whose life stories are developed simultaneously with the game. With Lee you recognize the other main character - Clementine , who will also accompany you in a whole game. During the game you will know more new characters but also some of them you will lose, due to your decisions which affects the course of the game. However, in the game you have limited decision time and less able people may have a problem with selection answers. Great voices of the characters and a soundtrack perfectly complements a powerful story.+ the diversity of the characters (some of them you will love, some of them you will hate)+ powerful story+ great DLC+ Clementine ♥- you can't skip the end of every episodeDLC: 400 daysI am glad that I receive this DLC to the walking dead. For me, one of the best DLC, which I have played. It is a great complement to the main story. It consists of five stories of various characters, who will at the end meet and get together.10/10	 ",237,65,6,19,16,1,21

												A video game has never wrenched my heart as much as this one. Less like a video game, and more like an interactive storybook. The writing is top notch, the voice acting is spot on.

 Review: What is the ultimate goal of playing a video game?  What do we, as those interacting with the medium, hope to walk away with when we let go of the mouse and keyboard at the end of a gaming session?  The answer is simple, but it is often difficult to achieve in most games.  We play games to attempt to grasp a sense of accomplishment and connection with the story that we just dedicated precious time to accomplishing. Telltale Games’  The Walking Dead  provides the player with a definitive sense of satisfaction and concern for the story laid out over the course of five episodes.  An expertly crafted story guided by Telltale Games, but shaped by each individual player, guides the narrative of  The Walking Dead .  Set in a sudden and bleak zombie apocalypse, players assume the role of Lee Everett as he embarks on an emotionally powerful endeavor to survive in this new world whilst still holding on to what little sense of humanity can be grasped. The ageless formula and storytelling abilities of the “point and click” genre has achieved a near-perfection in every episode of  The Walking Dead .  At moments, controls can become finicky such as when navigating the main character, Lee Everett, around tight spaces, but this shortcoming in control is easily forgotten as the narrative itself of  The Walking Dead  slowly build up momentum and gathers the attention of all who have the chance to enjoy the game. Positives: The sense of personalization to the story and connection with the characters felt by the player in  The Walking Dead  is rarely found in gaming today.Episode 5: “No Time Left” instantly ranks amongst the most powerful moments in all of gaming.Even the smallest decisions made seem to come back and appear later on in the game as both minor references and also major repercussions.Musical score is equally as powerful as the writing of the story itself.The multitude of different endings possible leave for a very high replay value. Negatives: Controls can become tough to operate at times, but these moments were rare and few and lasted for only a brief few seconds.Pacing can become slow at some instances in the story, particular in Episode 3: ""Long Road Ahead.""  This by no means takes away form the overall experience of playing  The Walking Dead , but at points, momentary issues with pacing become prevalent. Summary: Telltale Games’  The Walking Dead  is a rarity in gaming today.  The connection developed and nurtured with the cast and their plight in the game begins instantly from the first moment and carries with the player through to the rolling of the final credits.  Support Telltale Games’ near masterpiece and download  The Walking Dead  today. Overall Score: 9.5 out of 10.0			",91,34,0,10,3,2,1

												I'm expecting this review to be short and so should you. This game has classic gameplay that can't be really talked about much. There aren't guns here or any machetes. This isn't Left 4 Dead.This grabs the comic books and says: ""Alright, remember when zombie slaughter is cool in the TV Show and fanboys don't shut about how awesome it is to chop heads off and look at Daryl's marvelously awesome hair of badassness? Well ♥♥♥♥ all that! We want to tell a story, like a true zombie game should tell, about the desperation of the survivors in a world lost to a virus that came out of nowhere!""And it succeeded at that. More so than the TV show. I now want more Telltale TWD Games. Not the TV Show.The TV Show kinda sold it's soul. You start 1st and 2nd season with what? Oh right, zombies, desperation and survival.""- Guys, this♥♥♥♥♥♥s giving more money than Brazil gave to the stadium contructions for the World Cup 2014! We gotta do more seasons!""""- Sir?!""""- Yes, Zach?""""- Uhh, I think zombies are becoming repetitive by now and the fans would be sick of zombies in a 3rd and 4th season...""""- Well, ain't this a zombie TV Show?""""- Ehhh...Good point, Sir! But I think we should add variety! How about add a generic villain and make this another TV Show about turf wars?""""- Uhmm... Interesting, Zach, and what about the zombies?""""- ♥♥♥♥'em, Sir! We'll slap some Microsoft Paint background in there and we focus on the gun on gun action between humans! No one will expect that! It's like a plot twist!""""- Heh...good idea!"" (After 5 minutes) - ""Yo! I just wrote the script for the next 2 seasons, print this♥♥♥♥♥♥and give it to the actors!""*A lot of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ later...*It became so boring and no longer unique. They are just rolling this into a big snow ball that will never end! It was so cool before, about true survival. Not anymore. Now it's like Dragon Ball of some♥♥♥♥♥♥ About looking badass n' stuff...Ugh anyways. I'm happy to report the game is the true return to the Walking Dead. This game is 90% story focused with conversations and decision making. Like an RPG, where you Role-Play. Gameplay's far from an RPG though. It's like a traditional point n' click adventure. Mixing items and solving some issues/obstacles along the way. Very simple and it's even simpler in the game. The puzzles are very easy and dont require much Einstein thinking.The star is the characters. You play as Lee Everett, a convicted felon for murder who has a car crash on his way to jail. He then heads to a home to get assistance. He then meets a lovely little girl alone at home. Clementine's her name.A huge journey then starts! With you protecting Clementine from anything that resembles a threat. A journey about emotions and hard decisions for you to make. It exhibits shock to the point of the player suffering true disgust and his/her stomach turned upside-down (Oh man... chapter 2. Holy...)Anyways I'll cut down to the chase. This is the best storyline in a video game ever! I've been gaming for over 12 ♥♥♥♥ing years! This game in the end accumulated everything you build up through your 10-12 single player campaign to deliver the most hardcore and blood-pressure increasing ending I've had the pleasure of witnessing. Everything ended with some suspense and at the same time, a satisfying sense of conclusion. And then the credits rolled...I couldn't see them well to be honest..."":O, why?""Because my eyes were covered in tears... yeah... I cried like a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the end and I am 100% proud of that. It proves games can tell emotional stories no other entertainment type can. You can't get this related to a character unless you play as them in a video game! Also proves I'm human! So... it killed 2 birds in one stone...That was the ultimate proof of success of it's storytelling. And I will never forget this game nor stop recommending this as much as I humanly can.There isn't much to talk about tbh. Voice acting is superb. Plot Twists and bat♥♥♥♥♥♥awesome. The ending is... no words can be said because no word exists to describe it well enough...Graphics are looking for the comic book look. And it succeeds. It tried to get the look right (which it got) and not to get Crysis 3 PC-Melting 1080p 3D Looking grass!Problems... ehhh... some bugs. I got stuttering issues on the first chapter. A huge bug/glitch on the second chapter. Game-breaking I'd say. But I managed to get it fixed, just restart a checkpoint or wait for the bug ""to run away"".Also, some choices seem like they matter. LOLNOPE. Some give you the (well done) illusion of choice, when if fact: you don't have it. You really don't. I would say it's quite disappointing.But as a (semi) linear story. It's perfect, it really is... Oh look, this review is huge again! I really can't control myself...Anyways, my final score is an 8/10 and I will go against common knowledge that score is what mattersin a review. Because it doesn't. it only appeals to those math/score nerds (like me). The Walking Dead is my personal Game of The year of 2012, even though other candidates have much higher scores of 9's and 9.5's.So go wild! Grab the money you saved for your rent or your girlfriend's engagement ring and get this right now!			",405,39,12,32,24,8,42

If you are a fan of zombies and TWD or just like zombies, good characters and a long and interesting story about a group of people trying to survive a zombie apocalyps than you must get this game NOUWW!!!

												This game is just simply amazing and beautiful. It's not just another zombie game where you see how long you can survive by killing thousands of zombies. It tells a story and that's a nice change of pace. It follows closer to the comic than the TV show and that's what I love about it. In my opinion the game is FAR better than the TV show. I guess the hype is all it's lived up to be. Graphics: 10/10Story: 10/10I recommend this to anyone who loves The Walking Dead.			",81,11,2,8,3,0,2

Immersive, gripping, emotionalWell, much has already been written about the video game ""The Walking Dead"" (season one). As a huge fan of the tv-series, I wondered how the game would turn out to be. Would it be another gore- and slaughter-festival, and how would they manage to incorporate the grim feeling of the series into a game?The answer to this is simple: TellTaleGames came out with a trump card, by casting this game as an interactive story. It's not about gore, not about fast and furious action, not about mashing buttons and quick reflexes (although there a some mild action scenes here and there). No, the whole idea is: you are the protagonist in a world where Walkers have taken over, and you have to make choices in order to survive. Choices: that's where this game is all about. Some trivial ones, some which have to be made fast (the time you have to decide is often limited), and some totally impossible and even heart-breakingly difficult. And what's more: it's often impossible to tell beforehand how the choice you make will influence the game and the story.Seldom have I felt so emotionally involved into a game. After a couple of chapters and especially by the second episode (there are six of them, all good for a couple of hours of gameplay), I was completely into this game, feeling connected to the main character and to the little girls he has vowed to protect. Form that moment on, this was no longer a floating gaming experience, no, it was more lke reading a gripping book, but with an extra: the ability of steering the story to a limited way. Awesome!Gameplay: 28/30 (simply superb storytelling)Graphics: 16/20 (comic novel and shell-shaded, very well done)Sound: 8/10Replayability: 16/20 (it's tempting to play a second time and make different decisions)Stability/technical: 17/20 (there are some short hiccups now and then when the screens change)Overall: 85/100			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												The problem with reviews for games like this (at the time of writing episode one is over two years old) is that pretty much everything has been said already.You probably already know that the story telling and emotion crammed into this 12 hour game is unbelievable. You don't want the game spoiled for you as this would essentially destroy the whole experience, but the ending for season one is probably the most heart-breaking moment in video games I have ever experienced - certainly since Shadow of the Colossus.Definitely pick this up and immerse yourself in the world, the characters and the choices you make along the way. The game shines through your emotional investment.			",279,88,5,41,50,7,56

												This game is a complete and utter joke...that is if your definition of a joke is a game with an amazing storyline, unique gameplay, and a million different choices and paths to take. Unfortunately, when it all boils down to it, you get the same ending but still, you get to choose what friends you make, same goes with your enemies, not many games give you the luxury of the sort.This may sound odd to some but, I also love the visuals/graphics/camera angles in this game, mostly because it takes me back to the Playstation 2 era. I remember playing alot of PS2 games that had hand drawn textures, just like this one.The music is just...beautiful, very suspensful stuff, you don't usually find music like that in games anymore, thanks to the ""crapstep"" genre, just go listen to BF3 or 4's soundtrack and you'll see what I mean...Overall, this game gets a solid 99/100 from me. Why the one missing point? Well, I uhhh...errrrr...sometimes the characters glitch out in cutscenes! Yeah, that's it!...			",121,13,9,4,6,0,12

												The recent TellTale games have quickly become my favourite games and it began with this incredible game. The Walking Dead has you play as a Lee Everret, a man on his way to prison on the day the outbreak began who takes on a small girl, Clementine, who you vow to protect as you journey through the big bad world looking for more survivors. I've never been a fan of point and click games but I am a fan of rich singleplayer stories and that is what this game delivers+Gorgeous cell-shaded art style+A compelling story +Unrivalled story telling+Amazing voice acting+Five episodes each around two hours long+The choices you make have consequences on the rest of the game, sometimes minute, sometimes massive+Very interesting characters who have rich backstories+At the end of each episode you can compare your choices with others who have played the game+Less focus on zombies, more focus on the people who you meet meaning you quickly become attached +The most heart-wrenching ending to a game I have ever encountered+/-Most of the gameplay comes from looking around or quick time events but if you're here for gameplay you're in the wrong placeVerdict:10Easily one of my all-time favourite games. It's probably not for everyone but I for one adore it. The perfect game for those who love a good story and/or The Walking Dead universe.El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

												4/20 Would bang againThis game is EASILY the best game I have EVER played. The music is breathtaking and goes well with the scenes, the story is emotionaly demanding, and everything about this game is wonderful. My only complaint is that it didn't last longer. I don't know why your still reading this, hit that buy now button. Personally in the top 3 list.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

IntroThis story driven game was developed and published by Telltales. The game was released in a series of episodes that came out months apart from each other.The episodes themselves were decently long going up to 1 (or 1 1/2) hours.  I am glad they learned from their experiences from their previous title Jurassic Park. It could have easily went bad if they didn't learn how to better develop fleshed out survival scenarios with characters who feel like they have depth and made reliable and realistic choices that you could relate to. Game or Interactive Movie?The only thing to keep in mind is that the freedom of movement compared to other games is obviously far less since its a adventure game. You cannot go back and revisit areas without reloading the chapters (unless its segments within that chapter). That’s because from chapter to chapter you're in a completely different location. This works well with constantly changing the environment. Character DrivenWalking dead doesn’t shine for having a great plot because lets be honest there is nothing really original with the overall idea of a zombie apocalypse. The characters and the angle they take on the story is what makes this extremely interesting. The depth is not on the zombies itself but on the instincts of survival. When people are backed into a corner sometimes the best and worst of people shine. Choice is Character DrivenChoice in this game didn’t feel like it impacts a lot like other games, however it does impact your relationships with the other characters. This to me is really nice because it doesn’t feel like i could bargain with NPC’s like, saying something nice 5 times to neutralize the time i robbed their piggy bank. Death is Character DrivenDon’t get used to anyone around you because they are not going to stay around for long. Typically people in this game die sooner or later depending on the choices you make. Some deaths are even unavoidable, but I will not spoil what ones. I will say that some of them got to me weather it was startling from the explosive instance of death or the slow horrible but inevitable death lingering around them. EndingWithout spoiling anything, this ending really concludes well with the game. It gives you satisfaction of beating the story, while also making you want to have more.\			",608,187,12,74,51,9,81

												I wanted to try this game for a long time to see what is all the fuzz about. I never thought much for this game, because it was a interactive movie like game.  This game will get you with great characters, sad plot and with well designed world. This game is all about story telling, so dont expect action packed or a really hard game. I really liked it. If you are softy gather some tissues i dont think that of myself, but the ending stole a tear from me. This game is full of emotion. Well done Telltale.			",110,18,4,21,9,1,11

Telltale did a great job and the series is my favorite as a whole even compared to Fallout.David ""Dave"" Fennoy is the greatest voice actor ever.WE ALL LOVE AND MISS YOU LEE.

												An amazing and captivating game which allows the player to immerse themselves within a world of choice during the course of a zombie apocalypse. You are a university teacher responsible for the death of your wife's lover and being sent to prison.The story is split into 5 episodes, roughly 2 hours each, in which you meet other survivors and develop opinions on their character. You can also make more difficult choices in the spare of the moment, creating or breaking bonds between certain characters. The beauty of this game is that every choice, every dialogue can affect certain opinions of you and alter the story somewhat importantly.The game offers a solid 10+ hours of gameplay, not including the DLC ""The Walking Dead: 400 Days"" (which is also an amazing and fairly cheap add-on) and the range of choices which alter the game, gives it an element of replayability.Overall, the game was simple and fun, with it largely focusing on the element of choice which allows individual players to tailor a personal experience. The graphics were unique and had the usual Telltale Games look about it. An amazing game I'd recommend to all Walking Dead and non-Walking dead fans alike.			",876,305,42,105,98,5,149

												Games that are tailored to the decisions you make are pretty few and far between these days, and eventually that itch is going to need some serious scratching.  Well, scratch away, people, because Telltale Games has you covered with this episodic title.  Basically, in a nutshell, the game is a dialogue heavy, decision based platform with a few quick-time event sequences in them.  While it's compared to Heavy Rain, The Walking Dead has strengths over Heavy Rain, and vice versa.  The decisions in The Walking Dead feel like they have a much greater impact on the story than Heavy Rain, however, the QTE sequences in Heavy Rain are extremely intense and failing them has great consequences.  In The Walking Dead, QTE failure just makes you restart it, so literally nothing is at stake during them and they feel like padding.  In the end, The Walking Dead is a very absorbing title for those who enjoy games with decision making over action, and is well worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interactive fiction, where your decisions supposedly affect the story line. Well, they sometimes do.I'm not sure the grand scheme really changes, but you really get into this new, harsh cold world and have tough decisions to make. It is mostly an interactive movie,but so involving that (we played together) my 11 years old son cried at the end of chapter 5 (S01).I made it to season 2.I usually don't like adventure games (since the old king quest games) but I really like what Talltale made in their games, and this game is perfect in what it is supposed to do.

												The Walking Dead... I wouldn't call it a ""game"" really, but it's an amazing, interactive, zombie themed story with comic based graphics and full bag of emotions. If you are looking for zombie shooter action game, you won't get that in here. Really, look at this game as if it was an interactive show with elements of adventure game, which gameplay is really simple and quick to learn. Your decissions will affect the other characters, some will keep their distance, some will be friendly and in the end you also might get emotionaly attached to some characters (including the one you control), the same way it works in TV series.If you like zombie games/series/movies and are you looking for something different, you are going to love this game. Hats off to the Telltale Studios for bringing us something new, something different.score: 9.5/10			",106,16,7,11,4,0,5

												Walking Dead is rather like watching five episodes of a new version of the show, complete with credits and “previously” montages, which all seems a bit odd for a video game . Based on the comic rather than the TV show, the game-play is a little lacking. Instead the game focuses on the story and the numerous difficult decisions and their often dire consequences. Oh, and now and then you have to hit a few keys in typical QTE style. It seems almost as if the game designers didn’t like the TV show and wanted to bring us the original story, but couldn’t afford live actors. Despite this, it has to be said that the story is much, much better than the TV show. For a start there is a black guy as the star, rather than the all American, gun toting plonker sheriff that we have in the TV show. And although there sure is stereotypoing, it's far less than the TV show - women can not only shoot in the game, but they often steal the show in the action sequences. That’s a totally different picture to the TV show, which often painted them as only fit to do the cooking and washing up.So all in all the game comes recommended, but don’t expect great game-play, instead settle in to a great story and atmosphere.

												The Walking Dead was one of the first games I was introduced to on Steam. I hadn’t ever played a game quite like this one. Before playing The Walking Dead, in my eyes games were limited to Pac-Man, platformers like Mario, multiplayer racing games, Zoo Tycoon, etc. I never really experienced a “choose your own adventure” game before, and prior to playing this game.. I wasn’t really all that interested in trying one either.Although I went into this game kicking and screaming, an episode or two in, I was hooked. I was not a huge fan of the blood and gore, but that aside, the story was very inviting. I truly felt as if I was making all of the major decisions in the game, therefore influencing how my character, as well as all those around me would turn out in the end. I grew attached to some characters (Ben) that took me on an emotional journey at times, which was interesting to me, because I never knew that games could get you to feel such emotional ties to a fictional character.Like I mentioned earlier, this game lets YOU decide how you want to play the game. You could play as the hero, or the villain. You can choose to leave people behind, and you can choose to save peoples lives. The most interesting part of the game is seeing how your choices you make earlier in the game can influence how your games pans out 2 or 3 episodes down the line.You start out the game as a man named Lee. You do not know much about Lee, but you soon start to see his backstory unfold. He may have a criminal background, but you can choose whom, if anyone, you want to share this information with as you begin to make bonds and partnerships with people. You later run into a little girl named Clementine. You learn she is currently on her own when something terrible happened to her babysitter when her parents went out on a trip. You and Clementine team up and try to escape the monsters that seem to be taking over the area. She reminds you time and time again that the main goal is to find and reunite her with her family, until then, you are her guardian. The things you two will encounter and defeat together give you two an almost inseparable bond. You two start to learn things about each other not many people may know, which will help you in the end when you have to make some major life altering choices. You will meet a number of other survivors, victims, and criminals along your journey together. You will have to make decisions on who you trust and don’t trust, and hope that the people you do bring along for the ride will have your back when it counts.Just remember that ALL of the choices you make, whether they are big or small will have some sort of repercussion. Some decisions you will have to make in a split second, and others you will have a little more time to think about.. but all your decisions are very important. Even though you may not always be able to save everyone from death and destruction, you have to remember your main goal is to keep Clementine safe. This is another layer to the game that makes all of your choices in the long run an emotional journey. Just when you think that you feel you’ve gotten away with something, remember you will have her watching you from the sidelines, learning to act just as you do.I hope you do give this game a fair try. There is a reason it has been so successful, the writers do know what they are doing. The artwork is different which makes gameplay enjoyable. Even though you are placed in a time period that may be depressing and hopeless, the graphics somehow make you almost feel a glimpse of hope to reach for. Being an apocalyptic type game, there is a fair share of blood and guts, but most times it is safe to turn your head and look away for a slit second. Embrace this different form of gameplay and open your eyes to the new experiences and emotions that will rapidly unfold when you play this game.			",9,2,0,0,2,1,1

												Looking for a game with a really decent story?Try this one.Even if you disliked Robert Kirkman's TV series,you will probably enjoy playing this.The gameplay is basically ""point n click"", but the story is so well written that you will find yourself wacthing a movie and not really playing a game.It deserves all awards it received.If you are a Walking Dead fan, think no more:this game is just for you.If you are new to Walking Dead, this is also a good place to start.If you disliked the comics/TV series, you should at least give it a shot.

												The Walking Dead is a point-and-click game with a heavy focus on dialog and writing, with a beautiful cell-shading art style and fantastic voice-acting.Dialog choices you make will heavily affect the game, and characters will talk to you, hold grudges against you or do kind things for you depending on those dialog choices. The characters feel human, and you really feel a part of this journey to survive. I really don't want to talk about it too much because I don't want to ruin the magic for you.I would recommend this to everyone, gamer or not. It is so easy to pick up and play. Make sure you don't give up on this game, it does start a little slow, but when you hit its rhythm, it has one of the best stories I have ever played through. It is so hard not to fall in love with this game. It is a phenomenal piece of work, with such a moving story. If you like a good story, Clem and Lee's adventures will most definitely fit the bill.

												Pros: - Great story- nice voice acting- it's definitely a nice experience. Totally worth it if you like the genre. Cons:- ""Choices Matter"" or ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" my♥♥♥♥♥ Basically you'll go from A to B, it doesn't matter what you do.Obviously your choices will have an impact on the game, but you won't really ""change"" your adventure.Anyway, if you don't plan to replay the game, you'll probably won't notice that, at the end of the day it's not a big problem. - A few bugs: I had to rewind a few times chapter 3, it was quite frustrating. - Sometimes you can't do what you want to do, for example: I really wanted to kill a certain character, but the game didn't give me the option ""kill"" :C ",693,219,20,57,55,9,64

												Love this game, if your into zombies and click n play style games then this is for you.Great storyline based on the comic, not sure how close this resembles the tv program but either way it works.Plenty of gore and violence just like a typical zombie horror, and i feel its a slow paced game but not the type to make you bored.Its a choice based game too, so each decision you make has an affect on the game and how it plays out. No questions buy it you havnt already.Id also advise to buy the 400 days DLC, its short but a great add-on, and im looking forward to season 2 as the story continues			",2748,1068,103,260,364,26,439

												The Walking Dead is an interactive graphic adventure, the first of Telltale Games to be critically acclaimed.You follow Lee and Clementine from the very first days of the incident that took place in Robert Kirkman's The Dead Walking universe. I'd just say it was an amazing story, worth every praise it has already got. What makes this one different from the other Telltale games I've played is that I was more identified with the characters, their pain, their tears, their choices and their regrets. I broke in tears playing this... And I still would if I played it again.★★★★★ | Loved it ",1106,404,22,130,65,14,117

												There is nothing to say about this game, which has not already been said. Having that said, I am going to say this. I doubted the game upon start. I rejected the choice of graphic style. I thought the music was lacking, I felt the characters were shallow. When I was mid-way through, I was hooked, I felt that someone had touched my heart, I was shocked about some of the scenes, I had built up new friendships, I had glanced at love and I were curious about the future.When I finished the game, I sat empty, yet my mind was filled with new wonderful things. I cried, not only from loneliness, but from happiness and fulfillment. I was ready to let it go, yet something inside of me wished for more.If I would have missed out on this game, I would not have been as complete as I am today. Though just a game with a lot of options, it changes you. It’s hard to walk away from this game untouched, or to wonder if it were something you could have changed. Was there something you could have done differently? ",220,99,3,41,27,2,54

												The Walking Dead is an adventure game by Telltale Games Studios best known for developing episodic games, such as Sam & Max, Wallace & Gromit, Tales of Monkey Island, Back to the Future, and Jurassic Park. The game is based on the award-winning comic book series created by Robert Kirkman, entitled The Walking Dead.The game is split into episodes that make up seasons, just like a TV show. The main protagonist of the first season of The Walking Dead is Lee Everett. The story begins at the outbreak of zombie apocalypse, at the time when Rick Grimes (the protagonist of the comic) is in coma. When the infection begins its bloody harvest, Lee is sitting handcuffed at the backseat of a police car. He was arrested for murdering a man who slept with his wife. The developers decided to present adventures of an entirely new group of people, while the major inspiration in the creation process was Robert Kirkman’s work, which is regarded by the developers as the canonical version of the story. Players can visit places and meet characters well-known from the comic books and learn additional information about them. The first season of the game is divided into five episodes. Completing each takes on average about two hours.The gameplay mainly consists of exploration, conducting conversations, collecting items, and solving puzzles. From time to time there are also simple action sequences, but it is worth noting that QTE (quick time events) do not play such an important role in this game, as they did in the previous production from Telltale Games - Jurassic Park. In contrast to a typical zombie game, The Walking Dead is not about exterminating hordes of undead. The developers decided on a slower-paced gameplay, and players need to keep quiet, especially in places where the walking dead like to roam.The Walking Dead is the first game from Telltale, in which decisions made by the players influence the experience. What you do in the first episode has consequences later in the story. It is worth noting that players have a limited time to make a decision and do not have a chance to carefully reflect on possible repercussions. When it comes to puzzles that you encounter in the game, they do not resemble “adventure game-like problems”, but reflect the reality of a zombie apocalypse. The creators also saw to it that the environment was interactive, so to provided players with more freedom when solving puzzles.The title has attractive, cartoon-like graphics, slightly resembling the comic books by Robert Kirkman. The game does not feature multiplayer mode and is distributed only via digital means.9.4/10			",190,44,1,46,12,1,12

												Just an amazing and extremely sad story.If you are not playing this game because you don't like the walking dead tv series well I don't like it either! Yes I watched all the seasons and I think the whole story is crap, how the characters behave, they all act like idiots or teenagers with a lot of hormones on them, everything that happens is stupid and you can't believe it I cannot feel attach or care with any of the characters because they are idiots and do stupid things, they are always putting themselves on risky situations for nothing. Here in the game on the other hand it's just as real as it gets (well sometimes you will find silly things but they are very scarce throughout the game), your main protagonist acts like a real human ADULT guy and the choices you made are really hard ones and they do carry consequences in both long and short term. You will end up caring for the characters.You will hate some characters and love others, but all of them behave like real people!The voice acting is superb!This game is a must game, BUY IT you won't regret it.The bad: Well the game is very poor optimized, don't know if it's the engine or what but it will hang between scenes for a few seconds, it's really annoying.The save system is not the best either, it will save from time to time (always on the same parts) so lets say you made a choice but you dont like it and want to load and try it again...well bad luck for you, sometimes you will have to play 30min...You can't skip the dialogs. (in a game like this with a lot of choices it's a must!)The DLC is very short!Last and I don't know if this is a bad thing (it was for me) the dialog options sometimes goes too fast, there are times when you don't have time to read what's on the screen but you need to take an action or the game will do it for you, lets say you need to read 4 lines in 3 seconds. (most of the time the games picks to not say anything at all on those cases) Happened to me 1 time on the entire game but It felt like the game was forcing me to take an answer and maybe with more time to think about it I would picked other and not that one.

TWD remembers me of that despite the fact that you can't really go back to the decision page and look up what could've happened if you had picked another option. You just feel bad after every choice you make.Nevertheless, this ""game"", that's more like an interactive movie, tells a brilliant story about companionship and fringes of society.

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English:Seriously, just buy it. It's wonderful, i can tell without a doubt that it's one of the best games i ever played in my entire life. It's an interactive story in a zombie-apocalypse universe, where all your choices will influence the events and the final. Yup, it's that kind of story.  And not a simple story, but a well written story, with well done characters and above all, an EMOTIONAL story. Because, let's face it, this game not only has an intuitive and enjoyable gameplay and a great story, but it even offers a series of emotions that leave its mark, if you LIVE fully the game. And they remain with you. It's simply perfect. 10/10, and i would forget it just to play it again. (Sorry for my bad english.)Italiano:Seriamente, compralo e basta. E' stupendo, posso dire a mani basse che sia uno dei migliori giochi a cui abbia mai giocato in tutta la mia esistenza. Parliamo di una storia interattiva in un universo di apocalisse zombie, dove ogni scelta che fai, influenzerà gli eventi che seguono e sul finale. Esatto, è quel tipo di storia! E non una storia qualsiasi, ma una storia ben curata, dai personaggi ben caratterizzati e soprattutto una storia EMOTIVA. Perché diciamocelo, questo gioco non solo ha un gameplay intuitivo e piacevole ed una storia fantastica, ma offre anche tutta una serie di emozioni che lasciano il segno, se vivi il gioco appieno, ti rimangono dentro. E' semplicemente perfetto, 10/10 e lo dimenticherei volentieri, solo per giocarlo e riscoprirlo ancora.			",256,136,0,45,18,0,36

												Decent controls with an effective user interface, The Walking Dead only lacks a fullscreen borderless-windowed mode in the video settings and built in accomodations for when playing the game offline, because without an internet connection your achievements will not be tracked and you may experience long pauses between segments.That being said, what this recommendation really comes down to is simply the story. As far as video game plots go, I'd say this is one of the best. And coming from someone who probably doesn't have much taste at all for the average story-driven game, that's saying quite a lot. Personally I've found most video games to lack good story development. Even when they are highly praised for it, like BioShock Infinite for example, to me they usually become rather boring after the first couple chapters of gameplay. The Walking Dead is the greatest exception to that, without a doubt it has found the perfect mixture of fast paced story-telling, interactive gameplay that will affect the plot, and characters that will not only strike an emotional response, but will have you growing more and more attached to them as they develop indepth throughout every episode.I'm confident this game can be recommended to almost anybody. After you've played through the first episode the story will keep you coming back for more. And with the amount of impact your gameplay decisions have on the plot, anyone who picks it up will become very attatched to this game and its characters.			",46,4,1,4,4,0,7

												After being recommended by a lot of people to play this game, I finally did, and I must say it would have to be one of greatest and moving zombie apocalypse games, and playing it was actually an amazing decision. And after that, now I am recommending it myself.  So this game is based on The Walking Dead comic books, and something that I really like about it too is how the graphics of the game follows the theme of comic art, which I found to be great. You can see even if the characters aren’t talking, the expressions on their face show their emotions. I really thought that was great. The sound effects are amazing, and always keep you focused on the game and make it that little bit more realistic (and can make you jump as well even if you’re not paying full attention).The game gets you from the moment you start it. You go on a journey through tragedy, fear, pressure, suspense, sadness… the list goes on. If you play this game and don’t get emotionally attached or feel any sort of these emotions I’d be surprised. 	Speaking of surprises the game is full of them, it’s unexpected, and some things that happen in the game will leave you shocked. The gameplay is simple, and the game itself is kind of like a movie, and when prompted you follow the instructions given. I like how the story is based on the decisions you make yourself, which is just another reason why I loved this game.There isn’t much else to say, all I’d suggest now is grabbing a copy of this game and a box of tissues and enjoy yourself!✮✮✮✮✮			",77,10,0,9,3,0,3

												I've seen my share of zombie movies and played my share of zombie games without ever becoming particularly impressed by any. Honestly I find most of them outright stupid, and with the zombie hype that has been going on the last few years the genre as a whole mostly leaves a foul taste in my mouth. But somehow I got talked into watching this show called ""The Walking Dead"" and it totally blew me over. Well written, great character building and feelings flying all over the board. I found it amazing that something related to zombies could be THAT good.Then I learned about that this series, or rather the universe of that series, was going to be carried over to an episodic adventure type game by no other than Telltale Games. A company that has helped keeping the adventure genre of gaming alive when it felt almost extinct. As a BIG adventure game fan I have happily supported this company by getting mostly everything they have put out, and that was also mainly the reason I got this series as well.I honestly had very little expectation of how this game series would be as I failed to see how it even would work to transfer the great writing and suspense that I experienced in the TV-series to an adventure type game. Even though I read good reviews of it I kept putting off playing it. I was absolutely certain that it was going to leave me disappointed.Well, finally I got around to play it, and now I kick myself fo not playing it sooner. I can not believe how good this game is. I don't think I can remember better storywriting in any game I've played before. You really get to know the characters you meet and you get feelings and opinions about them. You're forced to make tough decisions in critical moments and you can never be sure if you did the right thing. Well, there is not really any clear right or wrong. There is mostly various shades of grey. Not only that, but your decisions affect the ones around you, and they will remember what you did or didn't do, and the game itself shapes itself around all this and creates different routes and takes on what you experience while playing through it.All characters are masterfully voiced by a selection of excellent voice actors that helps making the experience close to magical. You'll find yourself laughing, crying, yelling at the screen and acting in panic. And you'll probably feel that you're in the middle of it all.Now, it has to be said that this game is probably not for everybody. I can see, and even understand that people might find the gameplay itself to be a bit dull or repetetive and probably feel there is little gameplay at all. If you hate QTE's then you might want to shy away if you do not appreciate a good story. Also, even though I quite like the artstyle I see some people being thrown off a bit by the comic like cel shading, and I believe the game would be even better with a bit more realistic touch. It certainly looks good enough in its own way and should in any way be avoided with that as a reason.I consider this game to be one of those games you absolutely should not allow yourself to miss out on. It is a game for the history books and you would want to tell your grandchildren that you were there to play it.I rate this game 10/10Recommended for everybody who appreciate video games, and their mothers too.Happy GamingTJ			",703,637,38,102,124,8,148

												Wonderful game in my opinion. There are some flaws such as the illusion of choice at some places (you can't change the main script event), not very much of a gameplay itself (mostly QTE and choosing between 3 variants of an answer), but these flaws don't spoil the whole impression you get when you play the game.I am not a fan of TV show Walking dead (watched a few episodes, didn't like them) and I haven't read the novel, so I didn't know what to expect from the game. But when I started it, I fell in love. Telltale games can really tell the tale, the story is the main core of the game.The characters are alive, they have personalities. My favourite is of course Clementine. She's just a child who becomes grown up having seen bad things happen throughout the whole story. There are some genuinely funny moments, but the most memorable are the tragic ones. Honestly, I almost cried during one of them.The game uses cell-shading style, and I think it really suits here. The game is based on graphic novel, so it looks like one.All in all, it's one of the best stories I have ever played. 10 out of 10.P.S. What concerns DLC 400 days. It's a good addition to the first season, as you meet a few familiar faces. And I know that it is a bridge between 1st and 2nd seasons, but as a standalone game it isn't worth it. For the fans only.			",264,157,14,55,23,4,33

												Very good game I highly recommend this game, without a doubt! However... the graphics for a 2012 game are pretty poor but if you are the kind of person that likes story driven games, you'll love The Walking Dead. Gameplay can get repetitive, so I would suggest playing every episode day by day, if you play all 5 episodes in one day I think it would be pretty boring. So yes, I recommend this game and I would give it a 9.5/10 there is no questioning why this game won game of the year 2012 so many times - Side note buy this before ""The Walking Dead: A New Frontier"" or ""The Walking Dead: Season 2"". But yeah, the story provides a unique experience, and I would pay full price for this game, without a doubt!			",97,20,0,10,8,0,9

												If you're a fan of zombie shooting or can't stand to be in a more psychological story game, don't buy that. The Walking Dead is a beautiful, albeit tragic, tale of people surviving a walker apocalypse: the choices you're making, while not impacting the ending, have an effect on your relationships with the others and also for other episodes: you save someone in Episode 1 instead of the other, it's that character that will appear the rest of the season 1. Buy it. Seriously.In more words, you're incarning Lee Everett, a convict that kill the man sleeping with his wife. He accepted his guilt as the honest man he is and during his journey to the jail, the police car has an accident with a zombie. Lee, surviving this, meets Clementine, a little girl, all alone in her house as her parents are in Savannah and her sitter is kinda... well... a walker now. Together, they'll journey through Georgia, meeting Kenny and his family, Lilly and Larry, her father, Carley, Doug and many others. Some of them will be just passing by, the others will be a group. Lee has only Clementine in mind. And during the five episodes, it will be like that.The first episode is introducting Lee, Clementine, Kenny, his family and the rest of the people that will be your group during the game (albeit some of them will disappear or appear later). You have also some characters from the comic/TV series as Hershel Greene or Glenn.The second episode is showing the life at the motel, where the group established his shelter. Some local people invite them to their farm, though Lee or Kenny are suspicious of the place. Drama will follow.The third episode is mainly set on the road, as the shelter has been attacked by bandits: between a RV and the train, Lee and Clementine will lose friends and meet new ones though a new enemy is finally revealed.The fourth episode is set in Savannah, where the group arrived and search for a boat, though they meet another group and agree to help each other. Some decisions are also made and Lee seals his fate.The fifth episode concludes the game: Lee searches for Clementine that, naive as she is, followed a stranger promising that her parents were alive and waiting for her, despite his state....The story is really the strong point of the game. While it's true that you're mainly pointing to stuff to have information and discussing, some choices have to be made: save that person or the other? Trust someone or not? Some quick time events are also present, some of them are kinda rigged because you can't win them but you don't necessarily die. Also, your decisions are influencing your relationships with others.The graphics are also quite good. Colorful yet tragic. Anyway, you're not bored because you're moving around too. Besides, the voice acting is also well-done.Nah, I loved the game, with all the tragic fates, some unexpected, some you're happy to see and others you wish they never happened. It's a nice entry into the Walking Dead universe, much more respectful than the TV series: they killed Andrea when she is a badass in the comic and still alive...			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

На протяжении игры не раз придется столкнуться с неоднозначным выбором, от которого будет зависеть жизнь ваших спутников.

												Let me be clear. This game is a cinematic point and click adventure game. But not as in the sense of old school Lucas Arts Point & click games ála Days of the Tentacle. Let's say this games forte is in the storytelling and creating illusions of you making valuable choices and putting them right in your own hands. The preset is good and episode one sucks you right into the world, directly from the getgo you care and want to be involved in the main characters adventure and see what the story is about and how it all plays out. The best part of this game, outside of the story is the pacing. Very rarely do you get frustrated by getting stuck somewhere in the game becuase you are unsure of what to do next, which usually is the case in such games. It only happened to me once in this game where I had to go and youtube it and to see how to get to further ahead in the story (The keys in pharmacy shop). That's what's so great about this game and maybe also not so great. Since the choices are so clear and given, it leaves you, the player, with little to no alternatives to do what YOU want. Say that perhaps in an heated arguement I would like to get out of there, or perhaps in an outbreak I want to stand and shoot more zombies and play hero, or I would like to escape with everyones valuables in the middle of the night and leave them stranded and so on. Of course these actions would not jell well with the main storyline, which I do get, but in a game like this, if there is anything I could wish for, it would enabling more choices for the player to make and truly effect the goodness or badness or the meh-ness of the character and the fates of those whom the character encounters. However, wIth the given choices also comes the responsibilities with the chosen actions, and this is why I think the pacing of the story is so good. With fever options a clearer story emerges and you are hooked in it all the way from the beginning until the end, at around 2,5-3 hours of gameplay, with some replay value if you care, I personally don't.The Walking Dead is simply a fresh take on the Point and click genre and makes me want to play some more. But for 10$-20$ I am not so sure if I can say it's worth all your money. But if you can get it on a sale somewhere, around 3-4 dollars/Euros, it absolutley is worth both your time and your money. The game will get you invested and interested, which is all that really matters in the end.I can't wait to get started with episode two.			",117,19,2,5,9,1,10

Is you cant change the fate of carly or doug, which annoyed me quite a bit, but overall the game is extreamly great. Great voice acting, animation is fine and the writing is really.. I ending was quite hard to go through. Worth? Yes. A little pricy for the hours you put in? Maybe but if you dont mind, then its totally worth it.			",94,10,1,10,5,0,9

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English:Seriously, just buy it. It's wonderful, i can tell without a doubt that it's one of the best games i ever played in my entire life. It's an interactive story in a zombie-apocalypse universe, where all your choices will influence the events and the final. Yup, it's that kind of story.  And not a simple story, but a well written story, with well done characters and above all, an EMOTIONAL story. Because, let's face it, this game not only has an intuitive and enjoyable gameplay and a great story, but it even offers a series of emotions that leave its mark, if you LIVE fully the game. And they remain with you. It's simply perfect. 10/10, and i would forget it just to play it again. (Sorry for my bad english.)Italiano:Seriamente, compralo e basta. E' stupendo, posso dire a mani basse che sia uno dei migliori giochi a cui abbia mai giocato in tutta la mia esistenza. Parliamo di una storia interattiva in un universo di apocalisse zombie, dove ogni scelta che fai, influenzerà gli eventi che seguono e sul finale. Esatto, è quel tipo di storia! E non una storia qualsiasi, ma una storia ben curata, dai personaggi ben caratterizzati e soprattutto una storia EMOTIVA. Perché diciamocelo, questo gioco non solo ha un gameplay intuitivo e piacevole ed una storia fantastica, ma offre anche tutta una serie di emozioni che lasciano il segno, se vivi il gioco appieno, ti rimangono dentro. E' semplicemente perfetto, 10/10 e lo dimenticherei volentieri, solo per giocarlo e riscoprirlo ancora.			",256,136,0,45,18,0,36

На протяжении игры не раз придется столкнуться с неоднозначным выбором, от которого будет зависеть жизнь ваших спутников. Telltale Games сумели с помощью ""мультяшной"" графики передать эмоции не хуже любых кинематографичных игр и доказать, что в жанре ""про зомби"" еще не все сказано.			",64,7,2,8,1,1,3

												Greetings to all who read the recommendation, I will say at once that I have not previously done so strictly do not judge, and so I would like to start by saying that the comic book series by Robert Kirkman is just awesome (I advise everyone). The walking dead remained the exception. So start with the graphics, if you honestly that I really liked, very well drawn in a minimalist artist.I'm not at all a fan of this genre of games, but the game I really liked, she is simply breathtaking and you're immersed in a cartoon, and you start to worry about all the characters. I believe that the biggest advantages of this game is the idea, the script and its embodiment in life, but not quite well but at a decent level. Cons: it is a very short game that I hope will add a lot of additional dome.I think you need to turn the game into the series with the additions people to wait it out as a new series. General and all I wanted to write a very cool game 8 out of 10. Buy and enjoy.			",104,8,3,7,3,1,15

												If you enjoy suspense filled, story driven cinematic adventures.. or atmospheric trials of survival at its finest.. or simply came here because of the mainstream success of the television show and comics.. just know.. you will not be disappointed.  As of this post, only two of the five planned episodes have been playable, but the way the game puts you in direct control of a torn man and a little girl, as well as the future of other individuals they discover, is perfect and really does leave you with that anxious feeling of having to wait for a new episode or season of your favorite show. I truly believe this is a great piece of entertainment and well worth your time and money.  I do recommend, however, playing through each episode in one sitting, thus completely soaking in what just took place at your fingertips.			",1012,235,33,160,67,7,189

												I'm going to make this short, simple and spoiler free as possible.Buy this game, now!I have never really been a big fan of PaC(Point and click) games, however this is one of the best games I've ever played. I'm going to tell you right now, this is not a game you're going to play for gameplay, action or whatever. This is a game you're going to play for the story, which is the main focus. Think of this more as a interactive movie, or even more accurately , a show.  Gameplay is a relatively similar to other PaCs, though there are some very minor differences such as more focus dialogue and story.A short, spoiler-freeish summary of the story:You're  Lee Everett, a former professor of history at the University of Georgia who, for reasons I'll let you find out, was heading to jail...on the day of the apocalypse. However, you didn't make it. You later find a little 8 year old girl named Clementine, alone, and you decide to take care of her. This where the main point of the game comes in; Keeping safe, and taking care of Clementine, who you will end up caring about a lot. Telltale does a amazing job of making you care about Clementine, a game as never made Me as emotionally invested in characters as The Walking Dead does. There are, however, a few small performance issues and graphical bugs, but I found turning off AA(Anti-aliasing), setting shadows to low and having it run as administrator fixed most of the problems.I would go into more about the games story and all that, but I really don't want to spoil to much.Please just trust Me, buy this game, and it's DLC 400 Days. Even if you don't want to pay full price, then wait for a sale and ♥♥♥♥ing get it then!I promise you, you will not regret it!If I had to do a stupid score thing, I would give this game a 9.9/10 and 400 Days DLC a 5.5/10=======================================[Updated My review]After playing through season 2, I'm going to change My rating for 400 Days from a 8.7 to 5.5/10 and would also say that you could skip it, as choices you make in it are, in season 2 at least, pointless, and most of the characters, minus Bonnie, have nothing more then pointless cameos.

												Rating: 9.5/10This game manipulates your emotions in such a way that you actually start feeling you're in the game. It is really immersive. You somehow start caring about every character, feel bad for the ones that died, get angry at someone else, etc. No, it doesn't have great graphics or a lot of action. It is just a simple narrative, story-driven game where you won't have anything else to do rather than walking and clicking on stuff. But the way in which the story is narrated, the way the game gives you tough decisions to choose from, the great storyline it has, is what makes the game amazing.			",185,18,2,32,12,2,23

												Sadly, I watched gameplay of all of the episodes of this season, season two and the DLC. But, that didn't stop me from buying it. Even this late after release. From what I saw - It was an awesome and unique game, like no other. I have much respect for taletale for that. They did not care what was trendy and what the mainstream thought they wanted. Insted, they gave us a more immersive and emotionfull  experience. A really interactive story. Not only did you interact with the game, the game interacts with you. It makes you reflect your descisions, it makes you think of how things can go, about life, etc. It triggers the most humane part of us, when the world in-game isn't. It is the game I've always wanted in the back of my mind, for years.So, even after knowing how somewhat the story might turn out like, I played it and I will never regret it. I had forgot some of how the story went, and my own choices made it turn out differently - Which is what made the game even better. The atmosphere was amazing, I can tell you. Not going to spoil anything, but there were moments where I felt sad for what happend in the game, looking on how things might turn out if similar occations happens. The inner greedy and bitter will have their inner them, radicalized and so will the good ones. The good people will do any thing they can do, to avoid the worst possible occations, to avoid hurting people, to help people. But, how you are treated, can also make you bitter. That's what this game reminds me of - You have to keep up the spirit, fight for the good, fight for humanity, or at least what's left of it. Show your humane side, your inner good. I see myself in Lee, partly due to the descisions I make is what fits my personality, and thereafter his. He did everything he could to protect Clem. He lost his folks, and didn't hesitate once - He kept on moving.The only bad thing is that telltale told us that the story would be tailored, by how you play and the descisions you made. But, that is only partly through. There are tons of situations where I could've done something, but didn't get the choice, and often when I did get a choise, I didn't get enough. Like, being able to backstab someone (the ♥♥♥♥♥ Lilly). Such features are needed. More freedom of movement, and deciding where to go between several routes, not just to savannah. I hope they once pull up again that is better than this game on descision making, even though this one still is the best one out there. Because, if they so did - I would've done anything in my power to save Carley. I could've jumped in front of Lilly and saved Carley, or jumped at Lilly. No, this game doesn't give that ability, which sucks. Telltale, you better come up with another similar game that does this right, or if possible, release an update for this game, that does it. Heck, even open up for mod support, so people can fix that themselves.Still..This game is a piece of art. That's what it is, and not a single person can deny it. No other game has made be feel more emotional than this game, and making me emotional isn't easy. I usually never show emotions in my life, emotions are things I keep on the inside. While this game, managed to bring it out of me. I don't have words to describe this game. It's a true masterpiece, and if you haven't played the game already - You better do it!Hands down, best game so far.			",39,3,0,1,2,0,1

												Amazing game !!PROS:Rich plot, well build-up characters, that you feel sympathy for, one way or another, even if you think they are ""bad""...Beautiful, comic-like graphics, different from what we may be used to..Game manages really well to keep you there...anticipating for what comes next... The choices you make give a movie-like atmosphere to the plot, with a couple of really emotional momentsCONS(?):As almost every decision-make game, you cant really escape from where it s leading you.However,your decisions affect the way the characters feel for each other, making you sometimes want to think more about what choices you make. It makes you care about them.It doesnt have that ""action"", like going crazy on your mouse and keyboard, but still you ll face some tough situations, where you ll die a couple of times before you ll be able to beat them.This game tells a story, a story you unfoldDefinitely a 10/10			",92,21,0,0,5,1,3

												As a huge fan of the The Walking Dead (TV series) I can honestly say that this game fits in well with the lore.  I truly feel like a character who's doing their best to survive while meeting and working with other survivors to make the most of a bad situation.The game is definitely not a Left 4 Dead for those who are looking only for that kind of a game.  The story, however, is incredible.  You feel like you're truly a part of the cast of a television show or a movie.  I am not usually a fan of 'Adventure' games, but this one has quickly become one of my favorite games on my computer and that's only after playing the first episode.			",622,155,2,165,79,3,130

IntroductionThis game... wow... this game sure puts you on an exciting rollercoaster of emotions. The Walking Dead by TellTale Games, is a must-have game that needs to be in your steam library. I mean honestly, you and everyone else who doesn't have this game, should be throwing money at it.AtmosphereThe atmosphere in the game is simply astounding. If you decide to go heavy into this game (which you should, to get the most out of it), in tense moments of the game, you really feel it along with the characters. I found myself shedding a tear or so when something bad happens/happened. And at the end, oh boy did I turn into a fountain. Honestly, if you didn't shed a single tear at the end, congratulations! You're a psychopath.ChoicesChoices in this game are very impactful. Sometimes not so much, but a majority of them are. I won't spoil anything, but just be ready to make not only tough decisions, but fast ones as for most of the choices you have a certain time limit, which varies in length.MusicWhat kind of music is to be played when and where is simply gorgeous. To me, music can make or break a moment, deciding the factor whether you couldn't care less, feel horrible for the character, or be happy like the sun.RelationshipsTo kind of go along with the choices section, there are so many different relationships you can have with people. You can befriend Larry, or be an enemy with him, and so goes for Kenny and everyone else.NegativesThe only thing I can really put down about this game is some of it's realism and glitches. (yes, I know that it's a zombie apocalypse and it's not real, just a game der da duh), For example, at the start when Lee slips on some blood, the blow his head takes (giggity) should have killed him or immobilized him for a while. There are also some continuity errors such as ""I only got one bullet left!"" then shoots three bullets.PlotThe plot of ""The Walking Dead"" is great. It's involving and it's alot easier to remember since you're the one making the plot. This is just a quick, and basic run-down. (no spoilers ahead) You start off as Lee. He's on his way to prison when they are involved with a car crash. a little girl saves him and from then on they fight for survival.ConclusionOverall, I would highly reccommend this game to anyone a fan of story-based games, a point-and-click adventure or a fan of ""The Walking Dead"" television show or comic books. 9/10.

												Literally just completed the story... What an incredible journey this game took me on. Can't remember the last time I felt so strongly connected to a games set of characters, feelings, backgrounds... I've hardly touched this particular Point & Click game style before but I am pleased to say that through this Telltale experience I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't just feel like I'm experiencing the story, I'm controlling it! My decisions ultimately changed the way my story progressed. This is not something I've come across alot in games, therefore its great to see this being a unique feature in The Walking Dead.I can see now why its rated as ""Overwhelmingly Positive"". If you are one of the crazy people that haven't purchased this yet, go ahead and go for it. An unforgettable gem worthy of anyones time & money. Already have Walking Dead Season 2 to continue with, and will definitely be going through more Telltale games as a result of this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I decided to give a chance to TWD after seeing so many positive reviews. Although I like the zombie theme, the series never excited me and I never read the comics, I was surprised at how good and special this game is.I confess I had already tested other games from Telltale and didn't like, point and click adventures are not my thing, but with the TWD I liked the gameplay, it's a game focused more on plot, dialogues and interactions of the characters but that has a dynamic side, with situations in which you should have quick reaction. The graphics are cartoony and the game has great sound quality, effects, soundtrack and voice acting.It's the storyline and script that the game shines, thoroughly engaging and captivating, a story in which you must make choices that impact during the game and in relations with the characters, there impactful moments when it is impossible not to be touched, addition to all is the construction of the characters, their qualities, defects and emotions is perfect, the immersive factor is present in a unique way in this game. The DLC is a good length, although short, sets the stage for the second season, I have to say I enjoyed the game much more than the series, I highly recommend it to everyone, even those who don't have much interest in this kind of game.9/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												I don't like zombie apocalypse games/movies. Possibility of it sounds for me really stupid - especially in our modern world with our GPS systems, payment purchases through fingerprints and fast Internet on the space station. But this game changed my opinion about zombies, because:1. This game magnificently shows you, how hard it is - to kill a zombie, which 10 minutes ago was a human with his own feelings, wishes, thoughts and memories.2. After 2-3 hours of game process you start thinking: who's worse - people or zombies, because all of them do awful things.About the game itself - it's brilliant. There isn't so much action, the whole game process is just point'n'click and sometimes QTE (with choosing phrases in dialogues). But the story and characters are wonderful. I would also like to note voices of characters, especially Clementine. Voices...well...impossible to describe it, actors did their best.Strongly recommended for:1. people, who want to see excellent story in the game2. people who like zombie apocalypse3. people who don't like zombie apocalypse (they will change their mind, as I did)imho, 10/10			",125,25,4,8,5,2,7

												In this movie from critically acclaimed director Hillary Duff, you play as the titular ""Walking Dude"". As a spiritual successor to The Big Lebowski this film falls somewhat short, but that isn't to say that it's not an interesting piece when taken on its own. It explores complex themes well out of the range of its predecessor; in fact, much of the story is told through flashbacks to the first Gulf War. I wasn't expecting such stark political commentary! I was also especially fond of Steve Buscemi reprising his role as ""Clementine"". That man is a true master of his craft.Overall, I would give this jogo seven out of ten. John Marston dies at the end.			",232,18,6,42,16,0,16

												Hi folks, this was the first time I had a chance to play this kind of game. I just tried it as I was enjoying the AMCs TV series with my girlfriend (we're still in the loops I tell you haha) The experience was distinctly exquisite and the story was a topnotch. You will quickly get attach with the character especially with Lee and Clementine. Here, you will be trained to make hard choices and DEAL with it.As for the graphics, I think it will run on any system even without discrete graphics card so you don't have to worry. It runs flawless though there's nothing in the graphics that will make you awe.If you're a fan of the Walking Dead, this is worth trying, but not everyone will appreciate it's beauty I guess.8.5/10  Great!

												As someone who does not keep up-to-date with the latest Walking Dead tv episodes, I've found this game to still be excellent, exciting, surprising, emotional and a ton of fun. It makes you feel as if the choices you make actually matter and keeps you engrossed in the story and wondering what's coming around every turn.The only real issues with the game is the sometimes clunkiness of the controls (Xbox controller recommended) and the seemingly bad optimisation leading to some considerable frame drops during portions of the game.Overall, whether you're a Walking Dead fanatic or just looking to check out one of the Telltale game series, I highly recommend trying The Walking Dead series before any others.

												I never thought a video-game would make me cry... Except for Mario Kart.With the joke aside, I'll list the pros and cons of this game:CONS:-Graphics: Yes, I know it's made to look like the comic book, but it just looked too dated to me. -Animation: Usually when the characters talked their lips didn't match their words.PROS:-Story/Plot: The story in this game was AMAZING! The people at TellTale knew how to draw their gamers into their game and make them feel connected to the characters.-Gameplay: Overall the gameplay was pretty good. It had just the right action and dialouge.-Controls: I don't feel there was nothing wrong with the controls. It was the basic click and/or move.WARNING: If you look up this game on YouTube spoilers will arouse, I don't reccomend doing that.Eh this is hard to put on a scale, but I'll give it a 8.8/10. I had a fun time with it, and can't wait to play the second one.			",149,43,3,4,5,2,2

												First off, it's important to realise that this isn't an action game where you beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of zombies. It's more like watching episodes of The Walking Dead, making decisions for the character and thinking on your feet. Essentially, it's a story based game, which is really, really enjoyable, if you love The Walking Dead.Your character is Lee, a guy who got in some trouble with the police when the apocalypse hit. He meets a little girl, Clementine, and the pair embark upon a journey together, meeting different people along the way. The story itself is absolutely captivating, and rest assured, even the most indifferent of people will shed a tear by the end of this game. The story changes completely depending on which choices you make, which is really difficult for somebody as bloody indecisive as me, and I had to restart sections frequently because I'd felt my choice had been wrong. It's moral led, which makes it even more challenging, as you have to make difficult decisions about food sharing, lying to people you like and ultimately, saving people. The game is extremely engrossing and you can't help but get emotionally involved. This was the perfect 'Sunday' game for me. A game you can ultimately enjoy playing when you're feeling a bit rough from all the alcohol you had the night before (ahem). It is involving, enjoyable and tests your survival instincts - not just finding food and shelter, but also your manipulation or capitulation when dealing with other people. I absolutely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the TV series or comics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has to be one of the best stories in a game that I've ever played. While the characters are very average, they are just regular every day people, the interaction you have with them creates an attachment, and emotional bond that you can't have with film or books. This is the first game that has had me tear up during its saddest moment. So because of that alone, this has to be the best, most immersing story I've ever experienced in a game.

												Really good experience, intriguing story, interesting characters and interactions. More like a interactive movie rather than a video game, which can be both good and bad. The good repesct is that it really got some really amazing cinematic moments and emotional events, which is impressive. The down side though, is that it basically don't offer a lot of freedom of choices especially on the key events. No matter what you do, something will destinated to happen and some people will inevitably die. It can be interpreted as you can't controll other people's life and death like in other RPG games though, but it did frustated me when I realized that.			",318,55,4,42,20,5,62

												The Walking Dead is a story rich game, the protagonist of the game is Lee Everett, who is a convict heading to jail, soon enough, he discovers that the entire world has some type of zombie infestation. He then has a second chance of survival. The Walking Dead's characters are amazing with unique personalities and plans. Some characters will attempt to stop you and become your enemy, and others will fight by your side and stay with you through-out the entire game. The Walking Dead is a pure genious game that deals with extremely heavy emotions, I bet everybody at least pushed out one tear at the end of the game. I would reccomend The Walking Dead to all of my friends, it is an extremely well-done and memorable game.			",31,4,0,0,3,0,0

												Wow what a gem this game is.  You play as Lee a man with a questionable past thrown in at the deep end at the start of a zombie apocalypse, at the start of the game you meet Clementine, a little girl alone.  Throughout the game Lee and Clem meet all sorts of characters and together try and survive in a world gone mad.The Storyline is dark in places and full of twists and turns but i felt myself constantly wanting more, it was like a book i couldnt put down chapter after chapter.There are lots of great things i can say about this game, the character development is some of the best i've seen in any game.  The dialogue is perfect, it really gives each character a personality and you get the feeling these people really exist.  With every conversation i found myself not just trying to say the right thing but voicing my own opinion as if i was the main character i was playing (Lee).  From dilemma's to arguements to simple discussions and decisions this is a game that will make you wonder a second later if you did or said the right thing.  The fact that almost everything you say or do has a lasting effect and moulds the game to your decisions amazes me.  The quicktime events are quite simple at times but then it really catches you off guard at other times where you near enough need lightning reflex's.I've never been a fan of cell shaded games but this is just something else, graphically it looks fantastic.By the end of chapter five i didnt want it to end, i felt a real deep connection to each of the characters, even more so with Lee and Clementine.Telltale did a fantastic job with this game and really can't wait for future installments of this series.9.5/10			",1567,586,84,146,238,26,242

												I have never really been too fond of the Point-N-Click Genre, but when i bought this in a steam sale i was blown away. The main catch of the game is that you are Lee Everett a convicted murderer on his way to prison but shenanigans happen and you end up in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.The rest of the game has you solving ''puzzles'' (using the term loosely since most of the puzzles are Putt-Putt level). And making choices for you and your survivor group such as: ''Oh no, theres only 4 pieces of food for 10 people who do i give them to and why?'' and: ''Gawrsh! two individuals i just met are under attack by zombies! which one do i attempt to save first?''Its choices like that that have you wondering throughout the episode wheter you did the right thing or not, but more on that later. The dialog and bonding with the other survivors feels suprisingly good. All the characters are packed with intense, deep and sometimes even funny dialog.The game consists of 5 episodes which arn't very big and took me 2 - 3 hours to complete per episode. A cool addition thing is that the stats are tracked and displayed at the end of each episode so you can see what everything else did.The Walking Dead world is filled with a lot of clues, backstory and information about how other survivors perished and other humans adapted to their new threat.But all this praising? isn't there anything bad to say about this game? Sadly yes, a lot of characters have random moodswings and sometimes the conclusion of a choice you made feel weird, for instance. Theres a survivor which you meet at the beginning of the game and being my first pal and all i helped and supported him as much as i could through episode 1, but when i got to the end of episode 2 and disagreed with him about smashing an innocent persons brain in i got constantly berated by him about how i ''Never have his back!'' and that kinda spoiled the feeling of the game for me.In conclusion, whether you've read the comics or watched the show doesn't matter (some characters make cameos but its not much.) If you fully want to explore everything the game takes about 12 - 14 hours to beat and i'd say it's well worth buying if you're a fan of zombie games (keep in mind that this isn't a gun-toting game but rather an emotional rollercoaster.) or the Point-N-Click genre in general.Make sure you have a sturdy ''Q'' key though.

												Wow what a gem this game is.  You play as Lee a man with a questionable past thrown in at the deep end at the start of a zombie apocalypse, at the start of the game you meet Clementine, a little girl alone.  Throughout the game Lee and Clem meet all sorts of characters and together try and survive in a world gone mad.The Storyline is dark in places and full of twists and turns but i felt myself constantly wanting more, it was like a book i couldnt put down chapter after chapter.There are lots of great things i can say about this game, the character development is some of the best i've seen in any game.  The dialogue is perfect, it really gives each character a personality and you get the feeling these people really exist.  With every conversation i found myself not just trying to say the right thing but voicing my own opinion as if i was the main character i was playing (Lee).  From dilemma's to arguements to simple discussions and decisions this is a game that will make you wonder a second later if you did or said the right thing.  The fact that almost everything you say or do has a lasting effect and moulds the game to your decisions amazes me.  The quicktime events are quite simple at times but then it really catches you off guard at other times where you near enough need lightning reflex's.I've never been a fan of cell shaded games but this is just something else, graphically it looks fantastic.By the end of chapter five i didnt want it to end, i felt a real deep connection to each of the characters, even more so with Lee and Clementine.Telltale did a fantastic job with this game and really can't wait for future installments of this series.9.5/10			",1567,586,84,146,238,26,242

												This has to be one of the best stories in a game that I've ever played. While the characters are very average, they are just regular every day people, the interaction you have with them creates an attachment, and emotional bond that you can't have with film or books. This is the first game that has had me tear up during its saddest moment. So because of that alone, this has to be the best, most immersing story I've ever experienced in a game. This is definitely worth playing.			",263,61,17,25,22,2,42

												I've actually had this game for quite some time, but never really bothered to play it, due to a combination of not having seen the show and not really knowing what the game was even about. Finally I forced myself to stop procrastinating and pulled up the first couple seasons of the show on Netflix. Now that's another story entirely, but it pushed me to give in and boot up the game.The first thing to note is this game is EXTREMELY story-driven. There's little walking around and even less controllable combat. But that doesn't matter, because the story is amazing. The storyline and dialogue are very interactive, and at least half of the dialogue choices you make influence something in the game, whether it be how someone else feels about you, or a friend's fate. Excellent voice acting and music only add to the story, which, like the show, puts you on a roller coaster of emotions from anger to fear to sorrow. My only complaint is the texture quality is rather low in areas, but that can be overlooked. I very much enjoyed this game.			",630,208,24,56,64,4,88

												The Walking Dead is one of the most brilliant things I have ever played. I've never been a fan of point and clicks, but my god, the story of this game. Never has so much emotion, tension and terror been wrote so well into a video game like this. This game made me cry, it made me make unspeakable decisions, and it did what no over game has ever done; it made me care about the characters Lee was with, as though they were my own freinds. My own family. I never gave up on them, and as I played the game further and further I felt everything slipping out of control till the inevitable end. And the thing I know is that it didn't all have to end like that. I could've saved people, and while I was playing I kept asking myself would it have been different and better for the characters if I had made choice A instead of choice B at point X in the game. This game makes you think about the world we live in, and it makes you feel overwhelming emotion toward the most real, most compelling, most engaging characters I have ever met in a game. I am in love with this game.I knew these characters for no more than 15 hours, yet they felt real to me. I genuinly did care about them. I can definatly see myself playing through this game again, trying out different choices, and seeing different paths. 10/10 Telltale are ♥♥♥♥ing writing wizzards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, it's important to realise that this isn't an action game where you beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of zombies. It's more like watching episodes of The Walking Dead, making decisions for the character and thinking on your feet. Essentially, it's a story based game, which is really, really enjoyable, if you love The Walking Dead.Your character is Lee, a guy who got in some trouble with the police when the apocalypse hit. He meets a little girl, Clementine, and the pair embark upon a journey together, meeting different people along the way. The story itself is absolutely captivating, and rest assured, even the most indifferent of people will shed a tear by the end of this game. The story changes completely depending on which choices you make, which is really difficult for somebody as bloody indecisive as me, and I had to restart sections frequently because I'd felt my choice had been wrong. It's moral led, which makes it even more challenging, as you have to make difficult decisions about food sharing, lying to people you like and ultimately, saving people. The game is extremely engrossing and you can't help but get emotionally involved. This was the perfect 'Sunday' game for me. A game you can ultimately enjoy playing when you're feeling a bit rough from all the alcohol you had the night before (ahem). It is involving, enjoyable and tests your survival instincts - not just finding food and shelter, but also your manipulation or capitulation when dealing with other people. I absolutely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the TV series or comics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the rare games that reminds us of the importance of holding onto our humanity - even while making the incredibly hard decisions that can affect a group of (in-game) people. It's not about a series of random choices or making the ""bad decision"" just for the hell of it. The game makes you start to care about those choices. And who is to say, really, what the right or wrong decisions are in a time and place so desperate as the world full of the dead walking? One of the best moments came as early as Episode 2 - where Lee, the main character, is forced to divide up a few food rations among too many people. Obviously it was one of those agonizing decisions faced by the protagonist, but I found myself more moved by that one moment than by many of those big ""AAA"" titles, even the ones that focus on a huge, immersive story. I'd recommend this even for those who have never played an adventure game before, or think that by doing so, they aren't playing an actual video game. Certain points in the game require a quick decision or action, which makes this more than just a linear, interactive story. The Walking Dead has it all - great story, gripping plot, complex characters, nice visuals, and lots of content. In fact, I'd say this one game has more hours of content than a lot of more expensive titles out there. Unlike some adventure games, where decisions don't really affect the ""big picture"" outcome, this game will record early decisions and have them influence events in later episodes. Additionally, the vast array of choices and possible paths can add many more hours or additional playthroughs to an already great game. Highly recommended if you want something a bit different from the market's latest shoot-em-up zombie game.			",352,258,0,43,28,2,14

But its much more than that.Its storytelling and characters is what defines it.Thru a campaign of five episodes we get to know a man and a young child on their journey thru the horrific world of Robert Kirkmans ""The Walking Dead"". Its somber, engaging, heartful and sad, and is a game for a new generation of gamers, that seek story as their first priority.Its hard to not feel when playing this game. And thats the best part of it.If you want a good game with engaging story, this is it!			",206,34,6,17,24,1,32

												I expected this game to be good, but nothing remarkable. So when I played through this game, I was stunned.This is yet another one of those guys that made me bawl like a little baby. The strength and power of the emotional bonds in this game are nothing short of exemplary. This game made my choices feel very impactful, and in my view not many games do that. There's a plethora of choices to make in this game, and it's very nice to see that each one has a significant outcome in your adventure.God, this game is amazing. You may argue about the gameplay being somewhat tedious and time-consuming, but it's the narrative and storytelling of this game that'll make you shed some serious tears. If you're not a fan of point-and-click adventures and you're expecting a fantastic adventure, this may not be for you.But if you're looking for a tragic and memorable story, by god is this a game for you!

Every outcome in this game is heavily affected by your choices of actions and speech, so you'll have to make the best decisions depending on the situation. You'll be asking yourself: ""What is gonna happen if I have done this??"" after every action that you have chose depending on the situation.I'm personally gonna give this game a rating of 10/10 althought it is just a point and click adventure, but most importantly..the story is top class.

												Fun game, but get it on sale. This game represents a growing ""genre"" in video games that some have called ""interactive storytelling."" There isn't really a ""game"" in here, in the sense that you don't control everything your character does. This game reminds me of a rail-shooter (like house of the dead) except you don't have a gun and the few shooting sections that are in the game are terrible. No, this game is more akin to a point-and-click adventure that uses a lot of quick-time events and every now and again you can move your character around, woot! However, if you are a fan of point-and-click adventure games, or have an open-mind to that kind of experience, then none of what I have said so far is really a problem. This game's glaring flaw is as Morpheus once put it in The Matrix, the problem is choice. This game claims to give you tough choices that will completely change the outcome of the story, but that is a total lie. Almost every choice in the game has little-to-no effect upon the over-arching story. The only thing your choices affect are the relationships with other characters, but you will never find yourself in a different town/base with completely different companions, or that any of your choices have more than one outcome, as all of the big decisions are locked in. Many choices aren't even choices! For instance, (SEMISPOILER ALERT) early on you have to choose to save the life of two people in trouble, but it's not really a choice because one of them is a child! What monster would chooses the other person? By the way, it doesn't matter anyway, because no matter what you choose the child lives and the other person dies. See what I mean? Every decision is like this, so it really matters little what you choose. So if you get this game, get it on sale and play it for the enjoyment of the story, don't expect to make any waves with your decision-making skills.			",127,8,2,9,2,0,5

PriceI bought the entire season for 5.74€ during a steam sale.Introduction The Walking Dead - Season 1 is an by Telltale Games made episodic Point&Click game based on the comic book by Robert Kirkman, and AMC’s The Walking Dead and was released in 2012. It features lots of great characters and great storytelling.Graphics / Surroundings This game features just like any other Telltale game the cell shaded art style. Which looks fine for today’s standards, but this is not the focus of this game so we’ll look past that. In terms of open world there isn’t really anything, it’s a pretty linear game.AudioMusic is there but very lightly on the background sometimes, so you’ll barely notice. The voice acting was done very well though and this is a big pro for this game, it really makes this game feel way more like a tv show or movie. Which can be a pro or con for you.GameplayGeneralAs said this is a Point&Click game so there will not be that much to say here.You can’t really do much more than just follow the story and occasionally walk around and explore a little, sometimes you have to react in combat and occasionally you have to use a gun. StorySo this is where this game really shines, You play as Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who is given a second chance because of a zombie apocalypse. While looking for shelter and safety you come across a little girl named Clementine, whose parents were out of town when the apocalypse started. Together with her you will make a journey and along the way you will come across lots of different people, some will stay a for a longer time with you and some might go their own way. Your choices affect the story, so if you decide to be nice to people they might do something nice in return later on. Ones you meet some of the longer-staying characters you will have the option to check on them occasionally, if you do so it can help you later on or not.Performance / SettingsThis game ran just fine on my pc, there should be no difficulties here.Verdict98/1001.

Its somber, engaging, heartful and sad, and is a game for a new generation of gamers, that seek story as their first priority.Its hard to not feel when playing this game. And thats the best part of it.If you want a good game with engaging story, this is it!			",206,34,6,17,24,1,32

												I expected this game to be good, but nothing remarkable. So when I played through this game, I was stunned.This is yet another one of those guys that made me bawl like a little baby. The strength and power of the emotional bonds in this game are nothing short of exemplary. This game made my choices feel very impactful, and in my view not many games do that. There's a plethora of choices to make in this game, and it's very nice to see that each one has a significant outcome in your adventure.God, this game is amazing. You may argue about the gameplay being somewhat tedious and time-consuming, but it's the narrative and storytelling of this game that'll make you shed some serious tears. If you're not a fan of point-and-click adventures and you're expecting a fantastic adventure, this may not be for you.But if you're looking for a tragic and memorable story, by god is this a game for you!

												Really good experience, intriguing story, interesting characters and interactions. More like a interactive movie rather than a video game, which can be both good and bad. The good repesct is that it really got some really amazing cinematic moments and emotional events, which is impressive. The down side though, is that it basically don't offer a lot of freedom of choices especially on the key events. No matter what you do, something will destinated to happen and some people will inevitably die. It can be interpreted as you can't controll other people's life and death like in other RPG games though, but it did frustated me when I realized that.			",318,55,4,42,20,5,62

												This is a really amazing and unique game, almost all your decisions have a consequence, unfortunately some few things are 100% predetermined. The game is full with memorable characters, and you will get really attached to some of them which will reflect directly with your future decisions. I found the environment to be a bit limited, but the immersive dialogues and sudden events really make up to it!			",532,183,35,76,85,10,146

												My favorite game of 2012. Rarely do videogames succeed in telling a decent story, it's very difficult to pull of in an interactive medium. But the game design structure of ""The Walking Dead"" nails it perfectly and it's concept can be ported over to tell any kind of tale. A great leap forward in the craft of videogame storytelling.

												So, firstly when I saw this title I thought it will have sam plot as TV series. I was wrong.This game really shows, how cruel can be people when they are in danger. Greedy and awful.This game shows the other side of human visage. It tells beautiful story of survivior- Lee and his ward- Clementine.I just could not stop playing when I bought it. Unfortunately I haven not got internet connection, so Steam statistics show just 5.8 hours. But for real, I ended it two times and both times it was very sad but beauty story.I think everyone should try playing that title, even if you do not like 'point and clicks'. This is not normal 'PnC', this is like interactive movie, where you decide, what will happen next.That is why I hardly recomend this game. Telltale- good job ;)!Pros:-Plot (whole history is awesome)-Moral choices (you can decide about almsot everything)-Optymalization (game works really good, even on older PC's)Cons:-Lots of choices do not change game much (also lots of them do not change anything)-Gnere (this is individual but some people hates 'Point and Clicks'My rating:7.5 out of 10			",80,11,0,6,3,0,3

												This game was the first game of telltale I have ever played but after playing this game I become a hugh fan of this company. This game is a story base game, throughout the entire story you are making choices ( sometimes big and sometimes small - the story adjusted to your choices and make them look meaningful, you feel like you have a huge rule on controlling the story  ). The story can be very emotional and make you attached to almost all the characters you talk with.In the zombie apocalypse word no one is safe, not even you, this results for a few epic moments of character deaths.Your way of play-through can result characters death or even save their life, there are also other choices that are hard to get, a moral ones, this game make you feel like you are actually inside the game and not just playing it. To conclude this game is very good and they managed to do the end of the story even better than the rest of the story. This game will make you want to play the 2 season of this game and even try telltale other games and maybe will even make you cry.My score: 10/10 -Perfect game.			",94,11,0,12,3,0,7

												The Walking Dead: Season 1, is well... a rollercoaster ride, really. While the cartoonish graphic which reminds some to the comic book might not appeal to those who prefer high quality, crisp images, the story is what draws people in. Out of all the games I played over the years, only a few sticks in my mind. Some because of sheer humor, stupidity and excitement; one is because of the multiplayer experience it has offered; others... well.. because they have 'infamous' reputations, good and bad depending on one's perspective. This game, was memorable in its own way. I'll start discussing the gists of the story, before going into the choices, graphics, etc.The story begins with the main character, Lee, in a cop car going to prison for a crime he commited. Let's just say, along the way, an 'accident' happened, and his life with the people he met along the way, changed forever. As society falls into disorder and chaos, the small groups that remained tried to maintain what is left of their humanity while hoping for the best. As the name of the game suggests, the situation doesn't improve and continues to deteriorate. To some people, they might not be able to handle the pressure. To others, it became a free-for-all. The fact is, when there is no rules, what stops a man from becoming a beast?Now, choices are one of the main driving force of the story. The game present us a story with choices, just like games before in the past have done so. But it is done in a more simpler way along with a *quicker* time limit, because you can't put down your computer and cook lunch while you have to decide which person you going to save from the undead that's going to rip them apart limb to limb. The choices in the game, are plenty and ranges from the typical 'good guy', the '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥', or just *silent* which gives the player a more personalized experience as you got to choose your own choices. Nonetheless, as the name suggests, one would expect grisly scenes, and the game does not hold back on some moments in the game, giving the ""WTF! I can't believe he/she did that!"" reaction. However, this game also succeeds in capturing the emotions that the developers (probably) want the gamers to experience which comes from excellent voice acting, especially for the two main leads, Lee and Clementine, a little girl he met after the 'accident'. It is also interesting to see how the relationship between Lee and Clementine changes throughout Season 1. It happens so gradually, but when you realised it, she was able to stand on her own two feet and take care of herself. Another props for the degree of realism (as you can't really babysit a kid in an environment where quick judgement and thinking on your feet means you get to live another day. While Lee wants to protect Clementine, he knew that sooner or later, Clementine will have to deal with it.Now, we talk about the gameplay. The puzzles are fairly simple and not too challenging. While some people might want harder puzzles, I find it just okay as what I find that the puzzles are not the main points for the game. I also want to mention that luckily, I do not have glitches, as I have hear that other people playing the game encountered bad glitches. Luckily, there is none of that in my games and even though it may exist in other gameplays, it doesn't turn into a game-breaking one.Then, I want to talk about the ending. No spoilers. Why? Because I find that by knowing the spoilers, basically you were shown the magic trick before you see the show, which in a way, renders the excitement and experience of seeing it for the first time to almost nothing. You might be excited, but you wouldn't feel it the same way if you didn't know it from the beginning. Let's just say no tears are shed. I was just chopping onions with the invisible ninjas in the room. All I can say, Telltale managed to create a great game that can and will be set as an example for future games. Why?Well.. I guess, it is because of the story, the emotions, the human side of things. What I find is that games don't need to have high-end graphics, famous actors doing the voice-overs, and customizeable items. I guess, the 'human moment' where the characters interact with each other, it also affects us and as we unconsciously used our intuition and beliefs to make the decisions, we would feel the emotional impact as well i.e. when we save someone but couldn't save another, we feel dread. It might not be as dreadful if you don't spent much with the character-per-se, but when the choices include the characters we have spend a few episodes together, it becomes a much harder task.The Walking Dead is worth buying full price, even though I bought it during steam sales :PKeep that hair short.EDIT: I also nominated this game for ""I'm not crying, there's something in my eyes"" award			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was never a big fan of all those zombie-slaughter-games. I only bought this game a while ago because it was part of the HumbleBundle. Now after I've finally came around to play it I felt very bad for only paying $1 for this game. It is incredibly nice, the story has alot of cliff hangers and quite some surprises. Everybody should give this game a try, but every sane person probably already played it. :)To make me feel better about that $1 steal I bought the 400 Days DLC and will also pre-order Season 2.

												Probably one of the best adventure games ever made, I've always felt like this season shines in a way that Season 2 just really, really, really doesn't. Really great pacing, a very somber tone that fits the story perfectly, and a cast of characters who actually feel like people, who's poor decisions are the result of more than them just being flat-out stupid. Nothing in this first season feels contrived, and while it's kind of vague to say, I think season one has a sense of ""humanity"" that the later seasons lack.			",310,80,5,33,11,3,23

GraphicsThe game is designed in a Cell Shading technology engine. Everything is simplified and realism is a matter of perception.For me personally; I'm a crazy comics fan, my dream is to make a comic book myself once in the future.Having checked the comic of the original The Walking Dead story, I say the game looks imspiring and I really liked it.The environment is simple enough to let your eyes go through the areas, and detailed enough to set up teh perfect mood for teh perfect moments.It's nothing like Borderlands I can tell you that. You may check trailers and you will understand.What we got here is a realistic comic story coming alive through animation.however, i noticed some bugs. not sure if its cos of my rig's age, but i noticed some very few bugs in the game.like a door animation missplacement once, or a face animation that was supposed not to be talking but the mouth was animated if it did.But well.. IMHO those were completelly minimal stuff to me. bugs exist in all games anyway so.Music and soundsMusic enough to let you concentrate on what you have to concentrate on.Pretty much is there, but doesn't take your attention away.No special soundtrack selections though no.Sounds and sound effect are pretty neat. Everything is simple and cool.Zombie sounds are pretty as amazing as i expected.GameplayThe game is focuses on a story, passing through your monitor's screen like a movie.The developer's said what you do matters on what happenes next, and they give you dialogue selections.BUT don't get it wrong. The story WILL take you into direct events and you will just have to follow that line.The only reason they give your those dialogue and action selections is to form the herp's character as you wish and affect the way the other characters see you and talk to you later on.You can be a good guy, a♥♥♥♥♥♥ a neutral person. the NPCs will remember your decisions and actions and it will affect their dialogies depending how much they trust or like you.Meanwhile the style of the experience is around the mood of an adventure game.Very basic moving controls, going through puzzling situations, examining items and landscapes and stuff.ControlsVery simple controls. W,A,S,D movement, itema nd action selections, left click for action.Using your cursor will help you look and investigate the places and items you want, aiming to kill zombies and generaly perform actions.The StoryIf you also are a fan of The Walking Dead, then your most def need to check this game cos then you knowhow awesome this zombie plot can be.If you are not then 2 things; either watch teh series first - cos the game contains a few spoilersor if you don't like the show just check teh game as a piece in your zombie fan collection.A warnign though. This is no happy candy smiley story here. We are talking about drama and crazy plot spins.If you like drama combined in a zombie story, then you will love this story for sure.The CharactersQuite a number of characters to meet in the game. The story leads you right to them anyway.The voicing is simple and nice. Each 'person' in the game has its own character and background story.You will have to interact, take decisions, gain their trust of ♥♥♥♥ them up. make friends or enemies.it was interesting for me going through the game, talking to all the characters, finding out about their motivations, trying to seek alies while in the middle of that survival horror you are places in.value/timeThe developers were smart enough to bring you the story in pieces.This way you still feel the need to see more and you never get bored.ATM there are 3 out of the total 5 chapters of the game available, each comes as a form of a free autoDLC updateallowing you to continue from where you left last time.The game is worth the while for zombie fans and fans of the specific comic or the show.I'm not sure how much it will last in time, probably not for much longer.The tv show is going to open the 3rd season soon and seems like there's a lot more ahead to see.So game developers will probably just end our game story at teh 5th chapter, and leave the ground free for Activisions FPS The Walking Dead game, coming (as said) on summer 2013.conclusionso yeah. recommended depending your tastes.for my tastes this game is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.hope this review helped you.check screenshots and trailers if you like.also check this gameplay vid in the link bellow with little to no spoilers inside, it will help you take a look of what this is about.

												This is a video game based on the comic book with the same title. Many of you may already be familiar with this as there's a TV show adaptation that is currently at its 4th season. To be honest, I never expected that a video game developer would come out with an adventure game based on this series instead of an action game (preferably, an FPS). Also, we know how rare adventure games are nowadays. So, its very existence is commendable and I can confirm Telltale Games did a wonderful job with it.The game, at times, feels like an interactive episode of the TV show. Rarely are you given the option to wander around and use many objects at your own pace. Gameplay is very easy: there are objects / people clickable so that your protagonist can interact with these. Occasionally, you get to make choices. These choices determine who will survive. I liked this as there are no good or bad decisions. Regardless of which decision you have made you'll anger some of the survivors that tag along with you while others will like you much better for the choice you've made. The game employs a third-person perspective but there are many scenes where the camera angle is different and gives the game a more cinematic feel. In case you are attacked by a walking dead you have to quickly react otherwise its game over. I did not like these as some of these QTEs (quick time events) were quite annoying and required a fast reaction. Other times gameplay was at my leisure so these break-ups I did not particularly like. Decisions you make carry over to the next episode and will also affect the end game in Episode 5. Some will help you when in need while others retaliate for not assisting them early on. I liked this concept and I found the story very, very dramatic. It is unusual for a video game to be this sad. You grow to like the characters and you feel really bad when they are overcome by the walkers.My review is based on Season 1. I liked it a lot so I'll definitely purchase and complete Season 2. The only downside of the game is the 400 Days released. It was a DLC and I believe it was too short and was not worth of its money. Still, if you like adventure games and miss those good-old point-and-click games released by LucasArts Walking Dead can bring back some really good memories.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												You will find yourself taking care of people who can not stand on their feet , diving in deep thoughts after harsh decisions and choosing sides between people who can't get along. Incredible story telling and beautiful soundtrack will make this emotionally driven story even more astonishing I would recommend this game to anyone without a doubt. I'm pretty sure ending will give you some hard time ;(			",82,14,1,8,2,1,7

												First of all, I think The Walking Dead is a horribly overrated and sometimes completely silly TV show. I have never read the comic from which it is based. Having said that, this game is one of the best adventure games in recent memory. It reminds me a lot of the old point-and-click games that I miss, like The Dig. I was as skeptical as could be and I am thoroughly enjoying this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was never a big fan of all those zombie-slaughter-games. I only bought this game a while ago because it was part of the HumbleBundle. Now after I've finally came around to play it I felt very bad for only paying $1 for this game. It is incredibly nice, the story has alot of cliff hangers and quite some surprises. Everybody should give this game a try, but every sane person probably already played it. :)To make me feel better about that $1 steal I bought the 400 Days DLC and will also pre-order Season 2. Props to TellTale Games!			",476,202,22,46,41,8,78

												Obviously if you've heard of walking dead you probably have an idea that this game is about zombies. I haven't read the comics, but I have watched the television series. My initial thought was it was going to be a game that had the television characters in here and basically replaying the episodes via games. However, they have a different storyline going on in Georgia, where convict Lee finds a young girl Clementine that he takes it upon himself to protect. Along the way Lee and Clementine meet other survivors that he must make difficult decisions with. Like most telltale games, this has a set of different choices you can make. Although at times I feel like any choice I make seems to have a negative connotation, I really loved the storyline. The ending was satisfying, and it led me to really want to continue on to season 2. There isn't a whole lot of action, and the puzzles are difficult to solve. Really, this game is just a sit and enjoy type of playing.			",81,110,0,9,23,2,4

You will have to make many tough choices within the game and you get to see how your character grows because of those choices.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game, nice story, responsive controls. It pretty much got everything right. I specifically enjoyed the time aspect of the conversations. Opposed to other point and click adventure games, you can't take too much time before selecting what to say next, it tries to emulate a realistic conversation by putting pressure on the player.Which is interesting and it pulls it off pretty nicely.Graphic wise it's decent. Not bad but not amazing either. The cell shaded textures look nice but some of them are visually pixelated, especially when the camera gets up close. The animations weren't impressive either, however the game excels in gameplay and decision making.You will be often times surprised by a very difficult choice that you have to make... all that under the time pressure.I recommend this game, it was a good experience!

												This game is amazing! This game is probably one of the best games I've ever played. It's not number one but it's up there. I decided to get the game since it was on sale so I don't spend as much money. Well, i'm glad I bought it. I would even buy it if it wasn't on sale! The voice acting is amazing as well. It fits the characters perfectly. Your choices is what makes the game more interesting. It's not just one storyline that the Developers decided to stick with. They wanted YOU to decided the end. You never know how it might end which makes the game a very good game. Love the comic/cartoon graphics of this game. It also fits the game perfectly. I'd give this game a 10/10. I highly recommend it if you're up for a nice story. P.s. I HATE Larry			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is all character development. If you think there's going to be a lot of action, you're wrong. The gem of this post-apocalyptic wasteland is the time you spend bonding or identifying with the characters. The story moves forward and forward, and only one thing remains constant in this game; Lee and Clementine's bond. Above all else, think about Clementine, because Lee is there with his manly soothing voice. In all seriousness, the game is GREAT. A lot of solving puzzles, defusing situations, and learning how each person stands in a situation. There are only a few hard choices compared to the second season, but assuming you choose the right choices, this ride of a game will take you from neutrality to empathy, to sadness, and then just misery. You're going to be flat-out bawling like I did when I finished this. The 400 Days Expansion is also worth its money, because it too affects the second season and any person that plays this game and finishes will crave more anyhow. This game is well done by TellTale, and always remember:                                                 Duck is a detective.			",82,19,0,13,7,2,13

												If you had to choose one game to play EVER, I would recommend the walking dead. Besides the obvious characteristics of what make a good game, a well made story, deep characters and a smooth gameplay, the walking dead throws at you loads of hard decision making. While the game itself suggests that your decisions affect how the story moves, they might affect how you see yourself as well. The walking dead is a life lesson waiting to be learned.

												I voted ""No"" as a warning to people who expect this to be a game. It is NOT. It is a movie where you occasionally get to do some clicking and solve (very simple) puzzles. Don't expect to be kill zombies all around (although you get to kill some).+ The game represents the atmosphere of zombie-overrun world very precisely+ The comic-styled graphics are a brilliant idea - Your choices does not matter. Seriously. You can be cruel or nice - in the end the result is the same. Sometimes you get to choose who dies and who lives but that's only temporary. BTW - the minus point is actually part of the whole ""The Walking Dead"" franchise idea. The only thing that matters is to survive. Again - it is a nice but it hardly classifies as a game. So don't spend money on it if you really expect to ""play"" The Walking Dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot recomend this game enough. I'm not used to these type of games, and I thought it wouldn't fit me when I first started playing, but after the first 20 mins I knew it would be something else. To me, this game is really close to perfection. It is the only game I've played that really adapts to the choices you make, and when I say ""really"", I REALLY mean it. It has got a fabulous storyline and for the first time ever a videogame ending left me with tears in my eyes. Yep. You get so engaged with the characters of the story that you become one of them. Definitely the best purchase I've made in years, I'm really happy to have played this. If you did read this until this point, then please, buy The Walking Dead. I promise you will never regret it, just give it a chance. Game of the year, definitely.´EDIT: 2 years have gone by - still feel the same way.			",206,33,4,27,21,2,22

												The Walking Dead Season 1 weaves poignant story-telling and beautiful art to create a game that I can only describe as a masterpiece. This point-and-click adventure game features excellent character development and a well-paced plot which serves to maximize immersion. Even if you are not familiar with the Walking Dead in other mediums (i.e. the TV show or comics), you will find yourself attached to the characters in this game. Every heart-wrenching decision you make has consequences, some large, some small, and you will often find yourself wondering if you made the right choice.Keep in mind, however, that this is not an action game. Don't look to this game for any sort of combat or survival mechanics. The purpose of the game is to tell a story, and it is an amazing narrative about love, loss and morality. If this is what you are looking for, then I would HIGHLY recommend the Walking Dead Season 1.			",102,23,1,19,28,1,20

												This will be a short review, because there's not too much about this game I can say that will not spoil this game. Based off Robert Kirkman's critically acclaimed 'The Walking Dead' comic book series, this game is a point-and-click narrative adventure; you control a character named Lee, who has to fight to protect a young girl named Clementine in the wake of a zombie apocalypse.Told over five episodes, TWD is played out like a typical point and click adventure; click on items, click on dialogue bubbles and click on areas to make Lee move. You'll rarely be in direct control of the action, but this is a strength rather than a weakness. You're a viewer of a cinematic masterpice, along for the ride, who chooses Lee's every word and makes every decision for him. The decisions you make will affect your relationships with other characters and ultimately affect the way Clementine views you and acts the way she does. The voicework and visuals is phenomenal, and allows you to experience the game just the same as a film or a television series. The story is brilliantly told, and you'll find yourself genuinely caring about the characters as events unfold, which is a damn marvel in today's gaming industry.The Walking Dead is a unique and entertaining game, with emphasis on narrative and character development unlike any other game I've ever played. You'll remember the ending long after you finish the game, which only serves to demonstrate the quality writing exhibited by Telltale. 10 / 10 ",310,28,9,21,14,0,36

												*For Those Of You Looking For An Honest, Detailed Review*Gameplay: For those of you that don't know, this game is more of an interactive movie, as opposed to a fully imersive game, but that doesn't make it any less interesting. Some people say that you're decisions do not actually impact the story which is kinda true and kinda false. The decisions that do impact the game tend to be a 2-choice decision usually deciding which people survive and those that don't. Other conversations that have 3-4 options tend only to result in slightly varied dialouge which all end up at the same conclusion. Also, your answers to those ""impacting"" questions will be re shown at the end of each episode showing what percentage of other players made the same decision as you. Kind of a nify addition.Controls: I actually streamed the game to my laptop from my desktop, and played it in bed with a controller. This game is perfect with controllers considering that most of the time you're not pressing more than one button at a time. On occasion you'll have to aim and shoot quickly, but it's not nearly as fast paced as an FPS. Story: Ohh.... THE FEELS.... This story, just like the Walking Dead TV show (Which I am a huge fan of) the game focuses less on the ""Senseless zombie killing rambo god♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and more on the drama, trauma, stress, and conflict that can come to those survivng the zombie apocalypse. Here is a breif Synopsis: (Mild spoilers):Your name is Lee. You have been arrested for murder, and are on your way to jail when the cop driver hits something on the road and swerves into a ditch. You wake up to the Zombie Apocalypse. You eventually manage to flee your way into a nearby neighborhood where you meet Clementine - the most sweetest, kickass, little girl you will ever meet. Clem and Lee then decide to make their way to Savannah, where Clem's parents were supposedly staying. Along the way you make many friends, have some heart breaking losses, and are faced with situations that I hope I never have to face in real life.Throughout the game, you will learn so much about your fellow survivors that you will consider them family. And I swear that unless you are some heartless, emotionless, souless monster, this game will hit you right in the feels as well.Graphics: The story is enough, If you only consider games if they have Triple-A graphics, then shoo, we don't like you're kind.I hope this honest review helped sway some of you into buying this awesome game!

												The Walking Dead is a graphic adventure, played from a third-person perspective with a variety of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead. In my opinion this is the perfect and I rate it a solid 10/10 a must buy!			",126,7,0,9,12,1,27

												6.5/10. Bought this because I am waiting for Life is Strange finale and wanted to play something similar. I give this game full marks for lip sync and voice acting. You must not find this game as emotional as Life is Strange, but the tension in this game is so good. But hey, choice doesnt really matters and you feel that they can make infinite episodes of running away from zombies with similar puzzles but with a different location....then a few survivors die in the process and it loops over like that again. No, I expect somthing more, like a few more characters built like Lee and Clementine. Still worth a go...buy it when it is on sale. 14.5 hrs of gameplay for you to finish the game.

												It can not be true.. I just do not believe... I was crying like a 9 years old girl... And i am still doing it... Oh, ♥♥♥♥ing wait! 9 years old girl was crying only ♥♥♥♥ing once for a whole game and i did it 3 times... No words, i am still crying... I did a lot of wrong decisions in my real life, but never i did it so hard as in this game... There were a moments, when i just spammed Alt+F4, when understood, that pressed wrong key because of lack of time... This is best game i have ever played. You can say that i do not now anything about really good games, but i do not care. There is no more time to write a review more. I have no more tears on the eyes, so i need to buy second part of this game and play it to cry more.If you will ask yourself why did not i say anything about cases, characters etc. you need to understand, that this game is not about the story, it is about the life, feelings and all the heaviness of life...

The game has an amazing atmosphere and a picture of a group of people and their moods, which can directly change all our choices throughout the game - YES! , One button we can change the whole course of the game and go at its own discretion.

												When i saw this game at first i was thinking that it'll be boring. I didn't like the style. I hated the zombie plot and stuff. I played first season on my phone and forgot about this game for a long time. However, after about two years i saw this game on sale, so i've decided to give it another chance and i wasn't disappointed. The plot was so heart-touhing, so interesting, so unexpectable, that i couldn't stop playing. I've been playing whole night till i finished first two episodes. I was thinking only about this game. Nothing more. When i came home I continued the game ASAP. In the end of the game i was so miserable. I couldn't stop thinking about the god damn ending that made me cry like a little kid. This game going to make you feel sorry, happy and mad at the same time. This game KNOWS how to make you feel real stuff. That game remains my favorite now on. Thank you, TellTaleGames, I love you.

Type: Single Player, Story Driven Point and Click Game.Pros+ Great visual design.+ Excellent writing and voice over performances across the board.+ Characters are filled with depth and morality is more often than not more grey than black and white in this title.+ Simple puzzle design works in this title's favour, as its meat lies in its story and characters.+ Engaging story that has the capacity to draw emotion out of the player themselves.+ Fantastic sound design and music that adds layers of ambiance to the title.Cons- While necessary, the QTE elements of this game can be tedious at times, but they complement the tension filled moments they accompany quite well. - Scene transitions can be iffy due to the game's engine.Get this if you enjoyed: Life is Strange; The Sam and Max Series; The Secret of Monkey Island Series; Full Throttle.

												Really enjoyed this. Not really a fan of the TV show, but I've had a blast playing this game. Really well-executed gripping moments, great characters, and a charming art style. As expected, the game centers around a small group of characters who are trying to survive the zombie apocalypse, having to deal with not only the undead walkers, but also bandits and heated disagreements between one another, which at times lead to explosive conflicts. The game especially focuses the most on the father-daughter type relationship between Lee, the main character, and Clementine, an 8-year old girl he meets at the start whose parents have succumbed prior to the start of the game. Their relationship is very deep, emotional, and was pulled off very well, making you care for both characters. There are many difficult decisions presented throughout all 5 episodes, whether it is having to choose which of the two characters who are in danger to save, choosing to mercy kill someone or not, deciding which character to side with in arguments inside the group whilst losing trust with the other character, and so on.As with most Telltale games, there are quick-time events present every now and again, requiring you to act quickly. Most, aside from maybe 1 which comes to mind, are pretty easy enough so not to be offputting for those players who hate QTEs (like myself). A few catch you off by surprise, but the game saves very frequently between the cutscenes, so even if you die, you only lose like 10 seconds of progress.A very touching story overall. Between this game and Wolf Among Us, I think Telltale has become one of my favourite developers. Not sure why I've not gotten into these games earlier. Even if most choices in them lead along a linear story path and have little effect on the outcome, the stories themselves are crafted so well that they simply absorb you into their world. I'm sure going to be checking out season 2 of this and other Telltale games in the near future.			",267,51,3,33,6,0,17

												I  wouldn't really call this a game, it's more of an experience. Despite the phenomenal experience it provides, i cannot recommend purchasing this product for the full retail price simply because there is little replayability. Think of it as a TV show, how many times can you watch it before you are completely sick of it? That being said it is definitely worth playing through atleast once. It is an experience you won't soon forget. Your heart will fight your mind as you struggle to make the right decision in many situations. It's not as important, but the art and sound is incredible aswell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, why don't you own this yet? While somewhat lacking in the puzzle solving elements which are a staple in most point and click adventures, Telltale focus on creating an incredibly immersive story with characters you actually care about. Some of the choices you have to make in this game will really hit you hard and has genuine repercussions instead of just black or white, along with some truly shocking moments throughout the five episodes. I haven't enjoyed a game storyline this much since Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I've not really been a fan of Telltale's games in the past but what they've achieved with The Walking Dead is nothing short of amazing. This is my first delve into The Walking Dead universe and I was just hooked from the start right until the end. You'd be doing yourself a great disservice by not picking this game up as you are in for such a treat. Highly, highly recommended!			",217,38,1,18,9,2,16

												This is not the perfect interactive novel but what Telltale's The Walking Dead is a classic tale of human survival whose foundation is built on solid voice acting, great visuals and masterful writing that conveys the difficulty and emotion of human interaction when the sh*t hits the fan like no other work in it's genre that I've experienced.    Other notes. 1) After each episode I didn't watch ""Up Next on The Walking Dead"".  No option to turn this off.  2)  Turn on Detect Selectables and Turn off Story Notifications.   Pixel hunting is not what this is about.  3) There are a few sequences where the lack of inverted controls can cause issues for people that are not comfortable with non-inverted controls in the first person.  4) If you're not a fan of this genre play it anyway, it's that good.

												I recommend this game for several reasons, these are some:1. It'll become in the best game you'll have ever played.2. You'll be in love with the nearest characters.3. It'll make you cry... And I'm not kidding.4. It's amazing what this game can cause on you.5. Don't worry about money, it's worth it, the best game you can buy.Well... This game was really incredible, when I bought I didn't even know what I was going to play, I mean, I thought this would be another game more for my library but when I started playing it I realized the story was catching me slowly, I mean, every minute spent in game it's awesome, you want more and more, you don't wanna stop. I've seen some reviews where people trash talk about this game just because they think ""This isn't a game"", they actually say that due to this isn't a FPS game or maybe because it doesn't look like any other survival game, this is more like a graphic adventure which is simply amazing, I love FPS games, even the games where I've spent more time have been FPS and survival games like Killing Floor because I really love them just that you have to be objective, that's the reason you need to be aware if you read one of those reviews, do not pay attention, that's trash, what you really need to do it's to buy this game, play it then write a review. I almost forget, certainly this isn't a game, this is more than just a game.About the game characteristics, I really liked the facial movements, I mean, when they smile, they're worried, they're afraid or when they are angry or whatever they are, I mean, I have to say that ""Tell Tales Games"" did a great job here, you can feel what the characters feel, the enviroment is pretty good, the voices are amazing, I think it could be one of the first facts which make amazing and cause a lot of emotions through the game. There's just one thing I didn't like and well... it's funny because this game was so good that even my mother played it and she doesn't know much about English and we played it with Spanish subtitles and there were some gramar errors, no big deal but you know, sometimes that's annoying, I guess who translated this game was a native English speaker who studied Spanish or something like that, it was't so many errors but it's just a suggestion.If you thought there wasn't anyone like Rick Grimes... Then you are going to know Lee Everett10/10			",149,30,8,12,8,1,9

												One of the greatest games created by TellTale.Based off of the comic series of the same name, The Walking Dead places you in the shoes of Lee Everett: a convicted criminal who must now survive in a zombie apocalypse. While trying to survive he runs into other survivors, most notably a little girl named Clementine. It's up to Lee to protect Clementine from both the undead and the living.With the exception of a few minor characters who only appear in episode 1, The Walking Dead is not connected to the main plot of the comics, so even if you haven't read the comics or watched the show you can still fully understand this game.The game is a point and click adventure that focuses more on the struggles of surviving/solving puzzles and less on mindlessly murdering hundreds of zombies (though there still are some action sequences). This will probably scare away most buyers, but the people who can get past this will find themselves enjoying one of the most emotional games available on Steam (to those that DO want a mindless Walking Dead shooter, you can purchase the mediocre Walking Dead: Survival Instinct for double the price of this great game).Along the course of the game you'll be able to make certain choices that may affect who lives/dies or how others treat you. Although these choices don't really lead to any major ""alternate paths"", they are enough to making yourself feel responsible for every choice you make. You may be tempted to redo your playthrough so you can redo one choice you made, but it's honestly better to just keep going since it'll make your current playthrough much more meaningful.Every survivor in the game is fleshed out and has something that makes them unique. Whenever a main character dies you will almost always have a rush of emotions - whether it be anger or sadness. Unlike most zombie games you will actually care about the main characters and how things turn out for them. Overall, there are some really amazing moments in this game that may leave your eyes running.I wish I could go into detail about how great each episode is, but I don't want to spoil them. Even if you aren't a fan of The Walking Dead comics - or zombie culture in general - you will absolutely love this game.			",124,28,3,14,14,4,6

												I  wouldn't really call this a game, it's more of an experience. Despite the phenomenal experience it provides, i cannot recommend purchasing this product for the full retail price simply because there is little replayability. Think of it as a TV show, how many times can you watch it before you are completely sick of it? That being said it is definitely worth playing through atleast once. It is an experience you won't soon forget. Your heart will fight your mind as you struggle to make the right decision in many situations. It's not as important, but the art and sound is incredible aswell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aside from some rather odd game mechanics which take a little getting used to, this is quite possibly the most emotionally resonant video game EVER MADE.  An amazing story, excellent characterisations and voice acting, and a feeling of actual involvement in events beyond just shooting stuff (or copping sleazy lap-dances, a la GTA).  ♥♥♥♥ers even nearly made me cry a few times...which hasn't happened since the climax to Bioshock 2 (what is it with these manipulative ♥♥♥♥ing game designers and appealing to the paternal instincts of male gamers to protect loveable little girls?  Paging Dr. Freud)...   Anyway, if you don't believe that mere video games can have all the narrative impact of a great feature film - yours truly certainly being in that category before playing this - and are adventurous enough to try a game which is ultimately more about hardcore decision-making than brutal violence - though it certainly has its fair share of that, too - then give it a go.  ""Interactive storytelling"" at its very, very best.Verdict: 9.5/10.			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												[Note : This review applies to both Season 1 and Season 2 taken together but applies to each one individually]Before buying this game, I didn't expect anything special. I knew it had good reviews and that's why I tried it.It turned out to be by far the BEST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT I've ever bought in my LIFE, better than any movie, game, book or anything else I've ever bought so far. The game genre is said to be a ""Point'n'Click"", but in fact it isn't that much ; there is no puzzle, there is just the story, and you implicated in it.I couldn't say this is a ""game"" though, you won't play, but you will be told a story, a beautiful story in witch you will be emotionnaly implicated as long as it speaks you to. Basically, I could say that the game is a big cutscene that you influate by your actions (by what you say in fact, choosing how to answer to the main characters). I KNOW that it sounds strange or bad, but it isn't, there is no way to properly describe how good this ""game"" is. To be a bit more clear, I would only see 3 reasons why someone could not like a game like that : ● They don't like cell-shading graphics (look at the screenshots)● They absolutely hate stories that take place in a Zombie Apocalypse environnement● They don't have a good English Level or don't know how to Install translations (2nd Season is in Full-English)Pros : + Incredibely good voice-acting and credible characters+ The way you are emotionally implied in the story, never had I seen that before in ANY game+ The possibility to ""influence"" the story and that you always feel that what's happening is because of your choices+ The whole story is intense, everything is useful, there would be no part to scrap down, I wasn't bored a SINGLE SECOND.+ Clementine as a deuteragonist (Season 1) and protagonist (Season 2), Tomboys as a main character FTW. :heart:+ The story is in NOW WAY predictable, you never know what will happen next. + Incredibly good ""filming"" and animation and character facial expression, as good and even better than most TV Series.+ The end... really... only time I cried in a Video Game. + Good Music (special mention for the End Credits)+ Simple controls : WASD + Mouse+ There is no need of a Gaming PC to run this, most computers will do the job+ You don't play this game, this is the game that plays youCons :- It has an end... no really... NO CON(-) Can have some resolution problems that can be fixed by the simple addition of a line in the start options on Steam(-) Translations in other languages than English are fan-made, the one for Season 2 isn't included with the Game ; play in English if you could for maximal effect. Conclusion : A MUST-TRY (at least in Sales, and at least for Season 1), 11/10 : best ""game"" and product I've ever purchased in my life ; I know that every game I'll play for a decade will surely not be as good as this one ; this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, THANKS Telltale Games =) + please, Clementine again in Season 3 :beg:PS. There is absolutely no need to know the Comic Series or the TV Series ""The Walking Dead"" to enjoy this game, the story is an original one based on the Comics. PSS. You will certainly need a little time to fully enter in the story, try to play at least 2 hours before saying that you definitely don't like it or you could miss something. PSSS. You need to play this ""game"" ALONE for a maximum effect.			",77,20,2,7,4,0,4

												I wrote a recommendation when this game first came out. On the first 5 minutes, I was hooked, and I said it was a 'great game.' However, after playing to the very end, I now understand the previous recommendation did not do this game the justice it deserves. It did not even come close.This game was brilliant. I will not reveal what happens, but the game's ending is the most heart-wrenching video game moment I have ever seen. The graphics may not be that of a 2012 game, but the pure excellence of this game is worth more than all the graphics in the world. Never have I seen a game that gives you a chance to create such a strong bond with all the characters that you meet, even the ones that didn't particularly like you. Throughout the entire story, I was on the edge of my seat, even after the last credit rolled off the screen. With astonishing writing, compelling characters, a heart-wrenching ending, and a strong emotional consistency, this game is - without a doubt - THE best game of 2012.Fellow gamers, whether you like zombie games or not, hear me out: play this game.You will not be disappointed.

												Right in the feels.The Walking Dead is an adventure RPG in the vein of old style point and click games. You are tasked with moving the protagonist through a series of puzzles and decisions through a point and click interface. You meet a lot of characters who all react to you and your decisions in different ways. Decisions you make can result in anything from someone being angry with you to the direct death of a main character. The characters are all memorable. All of them.The puzzles are fun and not too difficult to solve. The game is more about the other people and how you treat them and acti infront of them.You should play this game for the story if nothing else. The story is fantastic and the decisions you make hold weight. It's kind of an interactive choose your own adventure book.The art style is very enjoyable and the writing is some of the best. I can't talk about the plot too much at the risk of spoiling it but I will say that it is a very satisfying story.I really enjoyed this series of tales and highly recommend you play them!

When the main character helps someone, I'm happy and proud I could do something helpful. When someone turns out to be traitor, I'm really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out and I feel a need of killing him. There're no words to describe the experience when playing this game. You HAVE TO play this piece of art.When I launched this game for the first time, I didn't like the grapchics.

												Let's begin by saying that The Walking Dead isn't so much a game as an interactive ""choose your own adventure"" book. There are a few action sequences but for the most part you are interacting with the different characters you meet and making decisions about what you should do at different decision points. These decisions have repercussions on what happens in the story.As a game it isn't very entertaining to be honest. As a story it is both bleak and potentially inspiring depending on how you look at it. Had I paid full list price I would have been greatly disappointed in both the game play and the length of the game. However, on steep sale this isn't a bad way to spend 8-10 hours or so. Just don't go into it expecting a happy ending or really even closure to the story as this is ""Season 1"" of a longer story arc.			",94,53,4,25,24,2,53

												If you look from the point of this not being a game and infact being a story then it is beautiful. The way Telltale managed to tell the story while giving you some involvemnet was captivating, true your choices don't really account for much (if someones gonna die, you can't save them) but still with each decision you will make different characters respond to you in different ways.The graphics, while not amazing for a game released in 2012, are beautiful, the comic-booky look works really well with the story feeling of the game. Voice acting is astounding and the music helps to keep the atmosphere. It is a little glitchy/buggy, but hardly enough for you to take notice of given then compelling side of the story telling.The characters are good, each with their own history. You can almost get to know these people, feel emotion with them as if you were actually Lee, it is submersive and it does this aspect well. You start the game in a police car on your way to jail,the car then hits a 'walker' and crashes its way off the road into a small wooded area. You have escaped jail, you are given a second chance at life, well too bad that second chance just happens to fall at the begining of a zombie apoc. You encounter a small child and take her under your wing, protecting her as if she was your own child, trying to always look out for her, do your best for her, ultimately ensuring her safety above your own. Travelling from place to place with the survivors you round up on your journey eventually endind up in the city of Savannah, this is where things got complicated for me, the ending. It is lacking, the last chapter and the things that happen in it just made me scream WTF, the actions of a certain person not justified fully enough to account for the things they are trying to do. It is a poor ending and after being so submerged in the rest of the game this kinda ruined it for me slightly, although I still enjoyed the game and the final, final, final bit was great.Overall it is really a point and click adventure/visual movie with minimal input and not infact a 'game', but it made me feel emotion and it kept me entertained for 16 hours, I'd play through again too, just to make different choices, even though I know they won't affect the overall game.

												A good story is that one that evokes you with different reactions and feelings, and let me tell you, this game definitely gives you that. With a different pace and style than many games, this exquisite piece of game will give you such an experience that you don't get in many titles, especially on the Zombie/Survival genre. Based on your actual desicion making, your first experience will give you a sense of responsibility for every action you take, and will sumerge you into the story and develop a sense of caring for every character.

												One of the best games I have played. The story is just so immersive, You just want to keep going (even though You have to wake up early for work...). Wish there was more You can do to 'tailor' the story the way you are, but I guess, some of the trade offs are for the best. One of a kind experience, highly recommended. Gonna for sure try other Telltale games and Season 2.			",277,79,12,55,38,5,66

												Lots of nice situations, often times without the option you would want.. but what do you expect - and it all goes down alright for the sake of story.The game is quite good, quite lengthy and the final chapter quite impressed me. I enjoyed it as a whole and I recall a lot of it despite playing the 5 seasons over approximately 18 months.There are some great characters and some great situations. The game holds your hand a lot, but it's mainly a story-telling experience anyway - the only issue I had with the gameplay was the lengthy *actions* that can trigger if I clicked something twice, which you might do if you think that your character (Lee) might have the same insight you have (not often the case). Nonetheless, the game is fun and I recommend you play it, though probably picked up on a good sale tbh.My biggest peeve was that a good number of episodes were driven by character interactions between your group, but the game never presented me with the option I wanted (namely who I should be accusing). I found it weird as much of the game was about managing relationships AND ACCUSATIONS, but the time that I most wanted to accuse somebody of the poison that saw massive change (and the loss of the single group member that I wanted to keep), there was no option to remove the single most destructive group member (my opinion for a while before that happened, and ultimately proven by the end of the game to be your *worst* team member).I hope Telltale Games grow a pair and tell their funding groups that they want to make a more ambitious game. From what I've heard, they may already have done so.			",169,24,2,28,41,3,57

												When I first played this I thought it was going to be horrible being a point and click adventure and all but as I played through and progressed through the story I felt myself becoming more attached to certain characters even relating to the protagonist with some similar issues maybe not as extreme but over all I was able to put myself in his shoes even in some parts feeling sadness of the character in myself. It has great drama and story progression based on your choices something I rarely see in video games these days. It's more a interactive show than a game, hell I actually liked this more than the Walking Dead tv series. I truly recommend this, if you want a good interactive story you'll enjoy this. Also If your looking for a shooter where you can rip through tons of zombie hordes and care less about story than this isn't for you, it's not Killing Floor.			",121,13,1,13,10,0,27

												One word: Masterpiece!If that is not enough:It is a point and click - puzzle - strongly story based game. The Story is effected by your actions and seeing lets plays with different outcomings is amazing! The story is really like an interactive ""The Walking Dead"" episode. You decide and you take care of you and the characters you started to care about.. it is strange and amazing how you start making thoughts about the characters. You can easily feel into this game, the character and the situation. Great story, characters, comic graphics and settings! 11/10 (I hate that, but this game really deserves it!)

												I played this game many moon ago when it released on 360 and recently purchased it on STEAM to play through once again. It is one of my personal favorite games. While having zombies in it, the fun doesnt come from cracking their heads (although there is plenty of it). The game is based around the relationships and interactions you have with the NPCs through the decisions you make during tough situations. You will both make and burn bridges with characters. You only hope you didnt side with the guy that gets killed ten minutes later and are stuck dealing with the guy you sided against for rest the game. As you will find if you play the game, the living can be much more dangerous than the dead. 12-15 Hours (more if you buy ""400 days"" episode) playthrough depending on how much stuff you examine. Its a great game, with an amazing story (that your choices help write), that is very different from other ""Zombie"" titles out there!			",57,6,1,9,2,0,4

												It's an engrossing storytelling experience. The voice acting and body language are good, the art is good, and the characters keep ending up in new situations to be uncomfortable about. Gameplay-wise, it's a pretty simple point-and-click adventure with trappings of choose your own adventure on top, and some quicktime events for action; not that special really. But still, as a CGI show with little things to make for a more personal single viewer experience, it's pretty great. Especially the episodes other than #3.			",272,85,2,39,30,1,78

												Okay, so I never planned on playing this when it first released.Adventure games are not really my jam, but many people told me I should give this game a shot nonetheless since it was different. Boy were they right. The story is compelling, the gameplay is not as ""bland"" as your usual Point&Click Adventure and since there are many different paths to take, there is a lot of stuff that can go wrong (or right) during your run.My one concern with the game is that many decisions will ultimately end in the same ending, but the game tries to make you feel like every single decision changes a lot. But that is criticism at a high level.This is so far the only videogame to ever bring me to tears and that is quite a feat.If you are sceptical, grab this game in a sale and maybe you will be just as happy about it as I am.

As an adventure game it didn't meet the thrills of puzzle solving, but it did bring a new level of atmosphere in storytelling within a video game.  I don't think I've been this emotionally involved when playing a video game.  This game helps breach the gap between games and movies.  Excellent game, go play it.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												The walking dead is an adventure game but surely it isn't the kind you would expect it. The game play is based on your rather fast responses throughtout the game and your very often quick decisions that decide how to game play will carry on. The game is very well done when it comes to pretty much all the aspects. The game will genuinely make you care about some of the characters in the game and what happens to them when the story continues, the game will surely make you emotional.  Walking dead is a game i would highly recommend to anyone its a 10/10.			",179,29,6,14,13,0,5

												As a fan of the first season of the show, I really wanted this game to work. It was recommended to me as a great story driven game with deep charcters. And it is exactly that, but more!Not really enjoying this genre - I was beyond pleasantly suprised with the game! It made me reconsider my thoughts on the genre as a whole.The word as we all know it has ended. Zombie craziness has ensued. You are Lee, you are riding in the back of a police car when the game begins. You'll find a small child and become responsible for her and here is where the similarities between your playthrough and mine will end!Your game will be shaped by the choices you make, or don't make, the things you say, or don't say and the people you save, or don't...The game has an understandably small cast, because, you know, the world has ended.The charcters you encounter are well written and believable. Resulting in sometimes agonising choices that need to be made. I found myself really caring about the charcters and wanting to do what's best for them all. This is a credit to the game designers who have done an outstanding job with designing them .As Lee you will have limited time to read through the choices and shape the game you want to play. This game will demand a reply if only to find out what would have happened if you'd said something different at that critical moment!Decisions I made in the first episode are coming back to haunt me even now, in the middle of episode 4!Although there are no real brain crushing puzzels to be found, there are a few basic ones to be solved and that's fine.The puzzles never get too trying or boring and are broken up very nicely by bludgeoning, slashing, stabbing and a general variety of very satisfying zombie killsA great introduction to the genre and a great game in general too!

												As a standalone game, The Walking Dead is excellent. I specifically say standalone, as there is a sequel, and it's very obvious from the ending of the first one that there was more story left to tell. Unfortunately, the sequel shames the greatness of the first game. So, if you're able to enjoy the game on its own merits, despite the emptiness from the story not being continued after the final episode, I would definitely recommend it.The Walking Dead is in many ways a story first, then a game. The main interactivty comes in with adjusting the way the story goes to your liking. The player character, Lee, can be as compassionate, morally grey, or obnoxious as you like, despite the presence of his moral compass so to speak, the young girl Clementine, whose parents have been lost to the zombie apocalypse. Granted, Lee will still show he cares a great deal for Clementine even if you make him a complete jerk, but you can still play him in a way that'd make it seem like poor Clementine would be better off without him. If you try to play the compassionate route, all the moral dilemmas that the zombie apocalypse throws at you may make you realise that doing the right thing isn't always so clear!It should be made clear, this is a story that revolves around the characters, as does the interactivty. Do not expect major branching, or even really much branching at all, in the plot. But do expect some variety in how long certain characters stick around and how they act towards Lee depending on what you have him say and do. Chances are, you're going to come out of this game wondering just how confident you are in your own morals.The biggest flaw of the game as it stands on its own is by far the lack of bug removal. You probably won't run into anything major playing through it once, but if you replay it, which isn't exactly an odd choice when I've played through it about 8 times and still haven't seen everything, you become more likely to have your save messed up, or the cursor refusing to go all the way to the right of the screen, and so on. On a technical level it's appalling how little Telltale cared.If you can get past the fact it doesn't really feel like a complete story due to the lack of a good second season, the fact your choices only affect characters to a degree, and the horde of bugs, this is a good game. Hell, before the second season really went to crap during its final two episodes, I barely had a bad thing to say about this game, the main gripe really is that its sequel is so bad. If you want an extremely immersive, gripping, emotional interactive story, this may be a good place to look!			",14,15,0,3,1,0,1

												I wrote a recommendation when this game first came out. On the first 5 minutes, I was hooked, and I said it was a 'great game.' However, after playing to the very end, I now understand the previous recommendation did not do this game the justice it deserves. It did not even come close.This game was brilliant. I will not reveal what happens, but the game's ending is the most heart-wrenching video game moment I have ever seen. The graphics may not be that of a 2012 game, but the pure excellence of this game is worth more than all the graphics in the world. Never have I seen a game that gives you a chance to create such a strong bond with all the characters that you meet, even the ones that didn't particularly like you. Throughout the entire story, I was on the edge of my seat, even after the last credit rolled off the screen. With astonishing writing, compelling characters, a heart-wrenching ending, and a strong emotional consistency, this game is - without a doubt - THE best game of 2012.Fellow gamers, whether you like zombie games or not, hear me out: play this game.You will not be disappointed.

												This would be the 2012 game of the year for me. Some people argue that the price is too high but I disagree. Because of the amount of choices you can make, you can replay a completely different storyline bringing up replay value. With Telltale's Sick B*****dism running aground the choices you make, you feel emotionaly invested. Also, because it has an almost completely different cast of characters, Glenn and Hershel are the only exeptions, Telltale has the ability to throw them into any situation. Did I mention the score this game offers? The songs fit tremendously well with whatever emotion is being convayed. With great story-telling, scares, emotional investment, music, and blood-pumping action, I give this a...                           -9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is freakin' incredible. The fact that you get to take part in the plot makes it amazing. They do a pretty good job at letting you get to know the characters, so there will definitely be difficult decisions to make in this game! It's also really cool how they show you how everyone else behaved in those same situations. Great plot, really unique gameplay. Recommended 5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has to be one of the most well written games I've played since I picked up Bastion. The story alone makes the game worth the money, even if you pay full price for the game. You will be moved by the deep connection Clementine and Lee build and you will cry...a lot. The gameplay has a few things that can be adjusted (like a run feature?), but it's hardly anything that takes away from what the game's true focus is. Even if you're not a fan of the show, or haven't even watched a single episode you can still enjoy this game. 9.5/10			",413,105,6,71,34,4,55

												I was quite hesitant in reagards to telltale games products. Had read a lot of reviews that complained these are not actually games. Kind of agree. These are all about the story (the category should maybe be ""Interactive story""). And oh boy. I tell you guys i'm not the one who cries at movies, or is generally thought of  as sentimental. But this game.. this.. interactive story.. ffs.. got me bursting out in tears by the final. Never ever been as touched by a audivisual product. This really gets you involved.			",67,27,6,11,20,0,26

												Waaay better than the TV Show and probably the first Telltale Game I actually enjoyed. I didn't like how Telltale games became so simplified that they're essentially just one long cutscene that asks you to push a few buttons from time to time, because I like a little more interactivity in my adventures. I also don't usually believe in license games for shows or movies. But I finally chose to ignore that and give them another try and treat this like something I might watch on TV - And I'm glad that I did! Gameplay is hardly worth mentioning, it's super easy and all as mentioned. But the story is one of the finest I ever got to play, creating a real emotional investment that reminded me a little of ""To the Moon"". There's lots of drama, flavored after the show of course but a lot more tolerable because there's no lame fillers / much smaller fillers than in the show and you get to be able to participate yourself, even if it is barely more than an Illusion of choice. Each episode was pretty nice and satisfying. There's also always some twists to keep things interesting so you don't always know what to expect. Choices don't matter as much as they want you to believe so I dunno about Replay value, but I wouldn't wanna miss this for sure. Get it for the cute little Clementine alone! :D			",516,165,16,48,30,5,69

												When i first heard the reviews about this game i was a little unsure whether i would enjoy TWD. However after a couple of minutes the story quickly took hold of me and I loved it.  See this more as a playable story than a  game. It is fantastic at what it does. However i had a TON of crashing problems... i could not load the game for ages and the saving feature broke down after about the 4th season meaning i had to skip sections i had previously done therefore the game made decisions on my behalf. It took a while but i changed the settings to run off a windows 2000 setting. Apart from the launch issues it was a great buy..			",70,6,1,6,4,3,4

												I have now just finished the very final eposide, and I felt I needed to write up a new recommendation here. This game is one of the best I've ever played, to be honest. The shining beacon that guides the game home is ofcourse the absolutely outstanding writing. The story and the characters are amazing, and I can honestly say it has made me cry quite a few times. But it's also made me laugh, and cheer, and given me the goosebumps. It is without a doubt one of the most engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences ever, and you should not even hesitate with playing it.  The ending was superb, but I won't spoil anything for you. The story is the main factor here, so you really need to experience it for yourself to understand why I love it so much. The only thing I think I can pray for now is that Telltale continues on to make a second season. I don't want to leave this world, I have grown so incredibly fond of it!			",994,296,27,120,82,12,159

												The Walking Dead is an interesting visual novel/point and click type of game. When I first went into it I thought it was about  talking to my group and trying to change their fates through our interactions. I was horribly disappointing to realize no matter what you do or what you say, the outcome is always the same. There is a huge amount of ""illusion of choice"" There is one point in the game where you have to choose between saving this guy or saving this girl. When you save one, the other dies and the story goes in a different direction and encourages replaying the game! Right? Wrong. Not twenty minutes later, the person you save dies anyways. In the end no matter your choice, both end up dead. There was no choice! This pattern continued through the whole game, I'd be promoted with a choice and the inevitable would eventually happen. I finished the game with a bad taste in my mouth. That is until I saw a discussion online about Kenny, one of the characters. The thread started off with someone saying how awesome Kenny was.He always had your back, was friendly, sacrificed himself, he was cool. I agreed. However most people in the thread said he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I was completely in disagreement! They were even listing quotes he NEVER said in the game! That was when it hit me. The events of the game are unchangeable but the characters and the way they interact with you is completely different for each player depending on your choices. Kenny was a nice guy in my game but a jerk in many other people's games. It made discussion about the game a ton of fun since everyone's experience with each character was completely different. Some characters tell some players things other players will never hear them say.Sure the events were out of your control but that kind of game would be a little high budget for Telltale, so I think what they pulled off was pretty well done all things considered. My advice is do NOT go into the game with the thought that you can change the outcome of certain character's gruesome fates, but you can change their personalities, and compare the differences and similarities between your characters and your friend's characters' personalities. Your ""best bro"" in your game could be your friend's biggest rival or worst enemy!			",24,13,0,2,3,1,2

												I don't have a daughter, but if I did I would probably hate her because she wasn't Clem.  The decisions I made in this game weren't about what serves my interests best, or the interests of the group, but on what a bunch of electrical pulses communicating in a binary language in the form of a young girl would think of me.  More or an interactive story than a game - there aren't much in the way of mechanics - but it's the story, and vitally, the tough choices you have to make that keep you gripped and progressing forward.  Your young companion is not just someone you have to protect, but it is someone you have to justify your choices to, and the game makes sure that this is something that matters.Very easily the best 'Walking Dead' story, and an excellent example of how gaming - as loosely as the term can be applied to this game - can be used to help convey emotion which other mediums can often fall flat of due to their passive nature.

												Let's begin by saying that The Walking Dead isn't so much a game as an interactive ""choose your own adventure"" book. There are a few action sequences but for the most part you are interacting with the different characters you meet and making decisions about what you should do at different decision points. These decisions have repercussions on what happens in the story.As a game it isn't very entertaining to be honest. As a story it is both bleak and potentially inspiring depending on how you look at it. Had I paid full list price I would have been greatly disappointed in both the game play and the length of the game. However, on steep sale this isn't a bad way to spend 8-10 hours or so. Just don't go into it expecting a happy ending or really even closure to the story as this is ""Season 1"" of a longer story arc.			",94,53,4,25,24,2,53

												Telltale's The Walking Dead is based on the canon of the hit TV Show and graphic novel series.  It is a point-and-click adventure game with quicktime elements - and it's a very good one.  The narrative, storytelling, and characterization is top notch and if one can refer to a story as ""heavy"" this game is more like having a pickup truck sitting on your chest.  It's a prime example of interactive storytelling and is an excellent model of how you can use the gaming medium to convey a story to an audience - even the camera angles it utilizes were wonderful, from staring at your reflection in a puddle as you beat someone's brain in to adding tension by having a skewed angle while you climb a ladder.  The game did have some pitfalls that comes with the point-and-click genre that it didn't avoicd unfortunately - repeatedly viewing things instead of acting on them/with them, repeating dialogue options accidentally without the ability to skip them, a few character and graphics glitches (I vividly remember speaking to an invisible Vernon and Kat cradling an invisible Duck in her arms) but besides a 4th wall breaking comic intervention these small negatives don't detract too much from the story as a whole.  The plot is very adult in nature and the gore and heavy themes are what you'd expect from a ""Walking Dead"" branded product.  What I found most interesting was the ""illusion of choice"" that seemed to be woven throughout the game.  Many people complain that every dialogue option and every choice you make should have an effect on the outcome of the game and many do; however, there are more than several situations in the game where no matter what you do something is going to go down in a certain way - many times in a way that could shock you.  As such, I recommend playing this game by the seat of your pants, don't reload, don't try again.  It's a more rewarding experience in the end since probably that one thing you didn't want to happen is going to happen regardless of what actions you take.  This can be seen as a pro or a con depending on your personality.  I find it a plus, as it allows Telltale's writers to weave a tighter narrative that has a much larger effect on the viewer than if everything turned into sunshine and rainbows for you (which is not going to happen anyway).  Leave it for a second playthrough if you must, but imagine this game as more interacting with a movie that you can steer around as you please to explore the world and interact with the characters in.  SPOILER FOLLOWS - Finally the ending wasn't too fulfilling to me, it almost seems like Telltale was holding back for a future release.  I would have liked to see how your 'parenting' options throughout the episodes effected Clem, and allowed you to see what kind of person she becomes after the credits roll.  Even if her actions post ending were in a montage format that would have been fine, allowing you to see if Clem can survive in this world with the lessons you've taught her. /SPOILERSPros:Great storytelling (narrative, themes, camerawork, ""whole-package"", etc.)Heavy, adult themes Cons:Minor point-and-click pitfallsEnding didn't ""wrap up"" to my satisfactionSome characters (while good) felt a little static or seemed to be only ""plot-devices""Even though I wasn't too impressed with the ending and the cons *appear* to outlist the pros this game is definitely worth a playthrough.  The story is great and this game is a great entrance for any gamer into interactive storytelling and what poing-and-click adventure games can be. B+			",711,211,14,90,55,8,86

												If you look from the point of this not being a game and infact being a story then it is beautiful. The way Telltale managed to tell the story while giving you some involvemnet was captivating, true your choices don't really account for much (if someones gonna die, you can't save them) but still with each decision you will make different characters respond to you in different ways.The graphics, while not amazing for a game released in 2012, are beautiful, the comic-booky look works really well with the story feeling of the game. Voice acting is astounding and the music helps to keep the atmosphere. It is a little glitchy/buggy, but hardly enough for you to take notice of given then compelling side of the story telling.The characters are good, each with their own history. You can almost get to know these people, feel emotion with them as if you were actually Lee, it is submersive and it does this aspect well. You start the game in a police car on your way to jail,the car then hits a 'walker' and crashes its way off the road into a small wooded area. You have escaped jail, you are given a second chance at life, well too bad that second chance just happens to fall at the begining of a zombie apoc. You encounter a small child and take her under your wing, protecting her as if she was your own child, trying to always look out for her, do your best for her, ultimately ensuring her safety above your own. Travelling from place to place with the survivors you round up on your journey eventually endind up in the city of Savannah, this is where things got complicated for me, the ending. It is lacking, the last chapter and the things that happen in it just made me scream WTF, the actions of a certain person not justified fully enough to account for the things they are trying to do. It is a poor ending and after being so submerged in the rest of the game this kinda ruined it for me slightly, although I still enjoyed the game and the final, final, final bit was great.Overall it is really a point and click adventure/visual movie with minimal input and not infact a 'game', but it made me feel emotion and it kept me entertained for 16 hours, I'd play through again too, just to make different choices, even though I know they won't affect the overall game.

												First of all, if you think that this game is like your traditional point n click game (like Nancy Drew) then this game is not the game your looking for because Telltale Series game are a bit more than just point n click, You control the actions, relationships and dialogoues of the characters in the story.  The Walking Dead is a Telltale Game Series where your decisions affect the flow of the story and not the actual ending itself. You decide what dialogues you see fit for the situation and the actions you choose affects your relationship towards the other characters.If you want to embody your own personality into the protagonist (Lee Everett) then go for it. You might even know what it feels like to make tough decisions and what it feels to make big sacrifices. This game is not just choosing dialogues but also interacting with the environment. (but not like Nancy Drew)The story is totally very good. It would make you feel like your watching the series itself. The ending is very sad and touching. It can make you shed tears.This game is really worth buying but I recommend that you buy it when it's on sale (preferrably a daily deal) so that you'll be able to buy the DLC and Season 2 for a cheaper price.The 400 Days DLC is not worth its price since it's quite very short for the 5 additional characters but what's good about it is that the actions you chose on Season 1 and 400 days will be carried over to Season 2. That's why it's worth buying Season 1, 400 Days and Season 2 altogether. Overall, it's a great game with a totally touching story. By the way, I'm not a fan of the series but I highly recommend it to everyone.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 10/10Music: 10/10Overall: 9.8/10			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

												Ever watch the walking dead and think ""Huh, wonder how I would do""? This is an absolutly wonderful way to figure that out. An almost 100% pure player decision game. The game features Lee, a man being lead to prison for a crime you learn more about later in game, and a ton of people who may or may not make it to the end, depending upon your decisions and actions. can your party survive? Can you risk falling in love with a point and click, reaction time game? It's a must try, and if you love it as much as I, there is a season 2! Don't forget to play 400th Day before Season 2! It fits right in the middle			",82,16,2,11,6,0,11

												I'm not a zombie genre fan. I think the whole genre is overdone and exhausted. While The Walking Dead S1 is a story about a zombie apocalypse, it's a damn good one, enough for me to highly appreciate the game. Experience the highs and lows of a group attempting to survive the apocalypse through the eyes of Lee Everett. The player becomes immersed into the story, and becomes emotionally attached to the characters. Interact with the game through quick-time actions, and make game changing decisions. Experience is greatly improved if each chapter (five in total) is played through in 1 sitting, so plan ahead and make sure the game needn't be paused midway. Good luck, and may your brains remain inside your head.			",307,108,10,37,22,2,51

												This game is absolutely amazing. But not by standards of games you are used to. This isn't one of those -Grinding, beat up the enemies repeatedly, level up, or run through enviroment kind of games... this is an emotionally involved decision driven game. There are many options for discussion and relationships with characters. Most everything is a cutscene with a choice in between, and there are small puzzles between discussions and a lot of button mashing. The graphics are also unique and most people would struggle to get used to them this day in age, but I don't. I love this game with all my heart, it's amazingly genuine and full of incredible characters that each vary and all feel realistic and sincere. I for one do not call this game boring for its unique gameplay, or ugly for its unique style. So please, try this game, give it a chance, and be in for the experience of your life. I keep coming back for more time with Lee. My total hours played should just tell ya.			",23,6,0,10,3,2,1

												Based on the Kirkman graphic novels rather than the TV show, Telltale's The Walking Dead represents a shift in tone for the company, from comedy adventure game necromancers to gut-punching best-of-a-bad-situation simulators!The focus is on a strong narrative that runs through the season, with hard decisions & character development front and centre. Gameplay mostly consists of mild (often guided) exploration, rudimentary inventory management and in-context quick-time events, which serves its function of moving the story along between locations and disasters.If you are a fan of any facet of The Walking Dead (TV or graphic novel) then this is indispensable.

												Easily the most intense and brutal point and click I have ever played. While being very much on rails this game does allow you to make decisions that affect the plotline and characters in minor ways. Playing through a second time will reveal how much these decisions really don't change the story at all, but the first time around is great!			",237,90,3,34,19,3,37

Some decisions you make are frustrating but it all adds to the overall feel of the game and makes it a lot more realistic I think e.g. if you sided with one person over another in real life that person would be p***** to.I recommend for anyone who is into zombie games and an in depth story game as it is a great game to play!

There're no words to describe the experience when playing this game. You HAVE TO play this piece of art.When I launched this game for the first time, I didn't like the grapchics.

												The Walking Dead is the prototype game in the industry that shows that storytelling and characterization in video games can easily match those we see in movies or television series. Your choices matter here more than anywhere else and can lead to devastation or salvation when you expect it the least. The well written story and your attachment to the characters - main or supporting - will keep you moving forward and make you question every decision you've made before. It's a game of 'what ifs...'. The story begins right on the first day when the epidemic starts. The main character is Lee Everett, who is on his way to jail in a police patrol vehicle when they hit a zombified humanoid they'll refer to as 'Walkers'. After a bit of wandering in a forest we meet Clementine, the eight year old girl whose nanny has also been turned and her parents are cut off in the faraway Savannah. The two start bonding right after they meet and Lee tries to look after her the best he knows. It's a really an emotionally powerful relationship from the gecko that only gets deeper. The game never tries to be unrealistic about the characters and their motives. Their goal is to survive no matter what, and I mean no matter. Not to find out what has happened or get some kind of cure. No. This makes it so interesting, you aren't Superman nor an action hero with unlimited bullets. The characters are real, everyday people that care about their families and themselves.The game has an episodic character. It has 5 episodes each lasting around 2-3 hours that adds up to a total of 12-14 hours of gameplay. Your choices move the story forward and the game sometimes hits you with an impossible choice that will make you wonder minutes after it. Sometimes it's really hard to make a choice, but sometimes it might not even matter in the end. You just never know when somebody steps in and changes everything. It's a great balance of making up your mind and not knowing what would've happened if. What is spectacular about the game that the other characters have their own stories and plans too, and it might not tally with your's. The rest if the cast isn't there to make your life comfortable. They aren't soulless vessels that obey everything you say. They can act on their own, even if you don't like it and often confront your choices.As a Telltale game it has a comic book character that is unquestionable unique, but hardly state of art. Neither artistically nor technically is a phenomenal game, but it has its own tone. It has other problems too. Frame-rate drops are annoying and camera angle changes can result in a momentary freeze of screen. On the audio front the situation is much better. The music and the voice acting is top notch, that supports the deep and emotional story.Telltale has hit the mark with The Walking Dead: Season 1. It's a spectacular point-and-click game where puzzles are secondary to the story. Yes, there will be times when you have to ask questions like, 'how to make this happen?' or 'how to make that work?', but those are only evanescent. The real question that you'll ask all the time is 'what is the right decision?' But you'll find out that there isn't one. It's a cruel world where everybody tries to survive and some tries to retain their humanity. If you're trying to find a superb interactive story, look no further, because The Walking Dead is a must have experience.Rating: 84/100; Replay Value: 5/5; To Beat: 12-14 hours.

												When it comes to the Walking Dead: comics > this game > tv show.  You must play this game for the story - but don't expect too much else.  Here, the pointing and clicking is more so about making quick (but important) decisions than it is solving puzzles.  There are a few basic puzzles and action sequences throughout - but you aren't playing the game for these.  As long as you know what you are in for, this is a great experience.

The dialogue in the game can be pretty funny but is mostly depressing, which is to be expected. The choices you make in the game really do have a strong impact in the later stages and the limited time to choose keeps you on your toes.			",219,41,2,10,5,0,4

												HOOOOOOO boi. What a game this is. So if you're looking at this review then you're probably wondering, what is The Walking Dead? Well, it's a 5 part episodic game made by TellTale Games based on the comic series ""The Walking Dead"". That was a mouthful, but yeah basically, this is a game where your choices affect the story. How, you ask? Well, simple enough. I'll explain it to you. Imagine that there are two people and you need to save one, who would you save? Guy A or Guy B? Who you choose will affect certain outcomes in the game but it doesn't change that much here. Stuff like will you save this guy or not? Basically those things. Moving on, it's time to start the review.Story: ( I won't spoil much)You are Lee Everett, a man convicted of killing a man who slept with your wife. You are sentenced to life time to serve in prison, you get in the car with the police officer, everything is all right. However, as the car is moving the police officer hits someone and as a result, the car crashes. You gain consciousness and find an exit out of the wrecked car. You see the police officer dead on the ground, you get his keys and uncuff yourself. He comes back alive, however not the state you'd want him to be. You kill him and go into a house you see after escaping from walkers. You find out that this house belongs to a family of a girl named Clementine. As you investigate through the house, you slip on a pool of blood and a walker attacks you. You have to kill her with the help of Clementine. It works, and she dies. Then you have to decide if you'll go find help in the dark or in the morning. (summary ends here)The story is pretty great, there were a lot of twists I wasn't really expecting on the way. It gets better and better every episode, more so with the final one. I loved Episode 5, it was really great imo. Perfect execution and ending. TellTale nailed it with the story.Characters:I for one would say that the characters in this game are really fleshed out. They feel real and can leave an impact on you. You might be asking yourself, ""why would Lee go out on his way to protect Clementine all the time?"". Well, that's quite a question but it's easily answered. He takes care of Clem because he wants to be there when her parents aren't, and adding up to that, he always wanted kids of his own. Going back to the characters. There's one character I didn't like much. Particularly Lily. I won't go into detail but, you want to care for her and understand her but then she does something really really bad. I didn't forgive her. Another character that isn't liked much as well is Ben. Why isn't he liked? Well, he gets a lot of people killed and is the cause of a chain of events that happens inbetween 2 episodes. He puts the group in danger because of his clumsiness and cowardness. He's a good guy but he's not really dependable.Sound:The gunfire sounds are pretty good. The sound of hitting stuff is good too. The sounds the walkers make are believable I guess. I don't know much about the music since I didn't really put my attention to it but that ending song is great. The one thing I know that is good is the voice acting. The voice actors really did a fantastic job in voicing their characters. Everyone's voice was pretty good, all scenes were acted really well. Graphics:I love the art style of TellTale so I like the cellshaded graphics that they did for it. Graphics aren't that amazing but they're good to me. They put a lot of work into the art and I can see that well. Overall great graphics.Gameplay:Not that much gameplay since it's an interactive story game but I like the gameplay. It's simple point and click. The shooting parts were fun too. As for the choices, TellTale again did a good job by making me pause for a while and think of what to do before choosing.

												I'm not sure if I loved this quite as much as everyone else seemed to, but it was pretty excellent.  You really are presented with one impossible choice after another.  Some episodes are better than others, and I thought the game was weighted down with relatively uninteresting characters, but the story and the experience is well worth it.

												This game is amazing but god is it emotional wreck just waiting to happen. Literally on every turn. Try not to bond with any characters in this game... cause it won't be pretty in the end. The replay level is pretty decent, I mean you can probably go about how you choose your story in different ways though, somethings are still going to happen regardless. I'm hoping the DLC is just as great, in which I'll update once I've completed that. I totally recommend this game! Not to mention the soundtrack is beautiful. [8.5/10]			",62,9,0,14,6,0,4

												One of the best story driven games I have ever played. The decisions you have to make are heavy and intense. Every chapter offers new twists and turns. The gameplay is a simple point and click, with some action variety thrown in, but don’t let that turn you away. The animation can be a bit choppy/stiff at places, but this game is a complete 10/10 in my book and I would recommend anyone with an interest in a beautiful story driven experience to pick up and play this game.

												Getting tired of the sometimes good, mostly mediocre character development and storytelling of the t.v. series?  Give this game a try and enjoy the anxious decision making moments you're faced with involving the lives of Lee, Clementine, and Kenny.  Very few games can make you honestly care about the characters portrayed like THE WALKING DEAD does and if this game doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you should probably see your psychiatrist about that.

												This game is pure interactive story more than anything. There are a few puzzles, some quicktime sequences to keep you on your toes, but more than anything it's a game that sells itself entirely on the strength of its narrative. If that's not what you're looking for, this won't be for you. Character models and animations are a bit dated, lip-syncing is pretty average, nothing about this game on a technical level really stands out. But as an interactive story, I can honestly say I've never felt so invested in a group of fictional characters before. Everyone is flawed but usually sympathetic, and the protagonist and his constant child companion are some of the most likeable characters in games.Even if Lee isn't a generic ""everyman"", you learn to very quickly identify with him and see things from his perspective, and Clementine is perhaps the only well-done child character in any video game ever. She's realistic, she's cute, she's scared, and she looks up to you. Every action you end up taking will end up going through the filter of ""what will Clem think?"", and the writing and acting does a wonderful job making you really live with your decisions. Despite the many player choices, this isn't a heavily branching story. The overall plot remains relatively the same regardless of what you do, though the fate of the supporting cast can vary. More than a branching plot, it wants to make it feel like your story, that everything that happens is a result of your choices, and it loves to make you feel guilty, whatever you end up doing. The writing and acting are excellent, and it's an emotionally brutal story in a way so rarely pulled off in games. Even if you don't like this kind of game, even if you don't even like zombies, this is a devastatingly sad tale that really needs to be experienced for yourself, if you can see past the limitations of the game built to tell it.

												This game will make you afraid.It will make you laugh.It will make you cry.It will make you love.It will make you hate.It will make you question your choices, not only in the game but in life itself.It will make you wonder what could have been.It will make you realize things you have never thought of before.If you have never played this game, you have never fully understood the concept of a zombie apocalypse. I'm not sure I understand it fully, even now.But one thing I do understand is that this is the most beautiful game I have ever experienced. At times, you may not have fun. You may feel wronged. You may feel cheated. You may feel repulsed. And this game is not for the faint of heart.But if you ever hope to fully understand yourself, and others, you will play this game.Play this game.

												This game is fantastic. Even though its nothing like Left 4 Dead or Killing Floor, it is still an amazing game. It has a interesting and touching plot with many different choices and options. You can be a cold blooded killer or the one who risks their life for others. The choice is yours. It is very casual and requires little to no skill to play  and succeed. The episodes did take a long time to come out but no worries now since they have all been released. 10-12 Hour Story Plot but It should be replayed to try and take different routes and make other choices. 95/100			",105,23,0,17,19,2,8

												The Walking Dead Season 1 is an episodic movie series, ONLY it's interactive which means you're both playing a game & watching a movie at the same time.Who Are The Developers:This game is developed by the brilliant minds at Telltale Interactive, who not only create games but they create storybooks inside games.About The Game:The Walking Dead is all about choices, choices that in the end may have dire consiquences & in terms alter the games experience each playthrough and throughout it's multiple episodes.The Review:In Season 1 of The Walking Dead you play as the main protaganist, Lee Everett, who is on his way to prison on day 1 of the Outbreak for commiting a fellony.Right off the bat you're thrust into the story that is both compelling to play through & complete & so  entertaining that awaiting each episode felt like what the Television series feels like while it is on break, it makes you want more & the lust of satisfication can only come from completing it as each new episode gets you even more sucked in.The story is 100% top notch and it not only makes you feel like you have to do everything in your power to protect Lee & Clementine (the secondary protagonist in Season 1 & the main protagonist in Season 2) from harm, this game forces you upon some VERY tough decisions but expects you to make them so quickly at the same time, otherwise death is grasping you and choking the life out of you while it sinks it's teeth in to your soft neck.During the episodes of The Walking Dead, you make choices that affect the entire game each episode & as i said early this creates a domino effect on the next episode that can either be a good thing or a bad thing, so make sure you're 100% about what choices you make.This game creates all types of different emotions, it can create: Suspence Fear Horror Happiness Sadness And on the final episode can even bring your emotions so low it can induce crying in even the toughest people. (Because the final episode is so heartbreaking & you feel as if all the work you've put into the game is being let out during the last few minutes of the episode).The Verdict:This game is an emotinal rollercoaster & a DAMN fine interactive story at that, it is one which if you're a fan of the the TV Series or even the Comic Books you'll be wanting to buy, even if you're not into The Walking Dead and are just looking for a story driven game then this game is for you & i can 100% guarentee that. (I swear on my life!)This game gets a 10 out of 10 from me.Why does it get a 10 out of 10? Because it's so damn good, it has a strong story, each and every character you meet feels like they are a real person & you're in control of each and every friendship or enemy you make in this game, if you make someone a friend then you're going to be treated like a friend and that friend will come through thick or thin to save your♥♥♥♥♥if you're in need of assistance but if you make somebody an enemy then you'll feel the hate from them with every choice you make and that will make the game a lot more difficult, so choose your friends carefully.Not only these few things but each episode brings new dangers to face & more hard decisions to make which all bring you 1 step closer to the absolutely beautiful but terribly depressing finale which will have you almost in tears (if not in tears anyway).Do I Recommend This Game?:Really do i need to say this? YES of course i do with 1 hand on my heart and a straight back i will stand by my purchase with this & NEVER ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK!BRING ON SEASON 2 AND ALL IT'S EPISODES I NEED MORE!Check Out My Review For Season 2:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/261030/ ",192,17,2,7,10,1,5

												When i first heard the reviews about this game i was a little unsure whether i would enjoy TWD. However after a couple of minutes the story quickly took hold of me and I loved it.  See this more as a playable story than a  game. It is fantastic at what it does. However i had a TON of crashing problems... i could not load the game for ages and the saving feature broke down after about the 4th season meaning i had to skip sections i had previously done therefore the game made decisions on my behalf. It took a while but i changed the settings to run off a windows 2000 setting. Apart from the launch issues it was a great buy..			",70,6,1,6,4,3,4

You feel the weight of every step, of every decision, you have to loosen every screw and push yourself to the limit. And at the end, you will find yourself staring into the screen at 4 a.m. in the morning feeling  like a real zombie apocalypse survivor - you will wonder if you could have done anything differently to save those you came to love. It will leave you gasping with tears in your eyes. This is how a story in game should look like. This is how games should make you feel.			",119,29,1,15,12,1,30

												HOOOOOOO boi. What a game this is. So if you're looking at this review then you're probably wondering, what is The Walking Dead? Well, it's a 5 part episodic game made by TellTale Games based on the comic series ""The Walking Dead"". That was a mouthful, but yeah basically, this is a game where your choices affect the story. How, you ask? Well, simple enough. I'll explain it to you. Imagine that there are two people and you need to save one, who would you save? Guy A or Guy B? Who you choose will affect certain outcomes in the game but it doesn't change that much here. Stuff like will you save this guy or not? Basically those things. Moving on, it's time to start the review.Story: ( I won't spoil much)You are Lee Everett, a man convicted of killing a man who slept with your wife. You are sentenced to life time to serve in prison, you get in the car with the police officer, everything is all right. However, as the car is moving the police officer hits someone and as a result, the car crashes. You gain consciousness and find an exit out of the wrecked car. You see the police officer dead on the ground, you get his keys and uncuff yourself. He comes back alive, however not the state you'd want him to be. You kill him and go into a house you see after escaping from walkers. You find out that this house belongs to a family of a girl named Clementine. As you investigate through the house, you slip on a pool of blood and a walker attacks you. You have to kill her with the help of Clementine. It works, and she dies. Then you have to decide if you'll go find help in the dark or in the morning. (summary ends here)The story is pretty great, there were a lot of twists I wasn't really expecting on the way. It gets better and better every episode, more so with the final one. I loved Episode 5, it was really great imo. Perfect execution and ending. TellTale nailed it with the story.Characters:I for one would say that the characters in this game are really fleshed out. They feel real and can leave an impact on you. You might be asking yourself, ""why would Lee go out on his way to protect Clementine all the time?"". Well, that's quite a question but it's easily answered. He takes care of Clem because he wants to be there when her parents aren't, and adding up to that, he always wanted kids of his own. Going back to the characters. There's one character I didn't like much. Particularly Lily. I won't go into detail but, you want to care for her and understand her but then she does something really really bad. I didn't forgive her. Another character that isn't liked much as well is Ben. Why isn't he liked? Well, he gets a lot of people killed and is the cause of a chain of events that happens inbetween 2 episodes. He puts the group in danger because of his clumsiness and cowardness. He's a good guy but he's not really dependable.Sound:The gunfire sounds are pretty good. The sound of hitting stuff is good too. The sounds the walkers make are believable I guess. I don't know much about the music since I didn't really put my attention to it but that ending song is great. The one thing I know that is good is the voice acting. The voice actors really did a fantastic job in voicing their characters. Everyone's voice was pretty good, all scenes were acted really well. Graphics:I love the art style of TellTale so I like the cellshaded graphics that they did for it. Graphics aren't that amazing but they're good to me. They put a lot of work into the art and I can see that well. Overall great graphics.Gameplay:Not that much gameplay since it's an interactive story game but I like the gameplay. It's simple point and click. The shooting parts were fun too. As for the choices, TellTale again did a good job by making me pause for a while and think of what to do before choosing. And that concludes my review of The Walking Dead.Story 10/10Characters: 9/10Sound: 9/10Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 8.5/10			",199,24,1,19,4,0,9

This is not a first person shooter game or that kind of stuff.... this is a point and click game. if you don't like that kind of game.... you will not like this game and think this is just some boring stuff.i like the characters a lot and the story is just keep getting interesting from an episode to another episode.one of the best game i have ever played for sure.And this game is the reason for me to play The wolf among us, Tales from the borderlands, and game of thrones because telltale is just amazing.10/10 for me			",65,13,0,1,3,0,0

												*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*>bought the walking dead>played through the first 2 episodes and half of the 3rd>was happy in every single second of playing it>after the 2nd half of the 3rd episode i ragequited>after looking at the achievements i thought things would be better>played through the whole game, cried10/10 would let it break my heart again :<<<But yeah no overall i'd say the game is amazing if you have time for it and you can play games like these where they're heavy on story if anything and not that much on other aspects/things.Graphics are cartoony, your choices DO effect how the plot unfolds, although there's some bits where you can't change them, which was kind of sad seeing as how the game is mainly multi plots and your choices effect things.There IS some combat in this game, however don't let your hopes up cause it's not really revolutionary or all that great.Like i said the game is dependant on it's story first and foremost, and the game is worth every single penny, i paid 13 bucks for it and still wasn't♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off after playing it.

												Well.. I don't know what to write. It is so emotional game. Some moments easily shocked me. I played so many games in my ♥♥♥♥ing life, but that game.. that game is one of the best games I ever played, if not the best. A great storyline, credible characters and awesome graphics. There isn't much more to be written, just buy it and you won't regret at least I didn't, this is really my cup of tea. DLC 400 days is good too if you want to know some characters from the second season. You can complete 100% achievements there as well.			",165,41,10,15,23,4,29

												Excellent storytelling throughout is where this game is really strong. You do begin to actually care about a lot of the characters which is something most video games are lacking (although admittedly, a lot don't aim for this). This is where the ame truly excels; it will scare you, shock you, make you laugh, probably cry, and in the end you'll just genuinely enjoy it (and after all, isn't that what we all play video games for?).The decisions you make as you go through are also a big selling point. the developers have clearly worked very hard on this aspect, and your decisions will have a very real effect on the game. The decision points are well designed, with almost all of them being difficult choices that really make you think about what you would do in the situation. You also get a breakdown at the end of each episode of how many other players made the same choices as you, which is a nice touch.There is also a very unique graphical style to this game, at first it seems a bit strange, and you could almost accuse the graphics of being ""bad"", but it gives a feeling to the game like no other, which can only be a good thing.The gameplay is a bit lacklustre, and at times frustrating; you'll probably find yourself thinking you didn't really deserve to die there more than a few times. This gameplay often consists of quicktime events, so it isn't exactly the most revolutionary game in that regard, but they are at least used to relatively good effect though; they seem to be mainly used as a way to keep the player engaged, often occuring when you don't expect it and making you spring into action. This, in part, means that you don't get bored during a long play session, and the episodic nature of the game serves to further break it up; playing through one episode takes a couple of hours, much more and you'd start to get bored.To sum up; this game feels very different to any other I've played. The storytelling is fantastic, the graphics are neither good or bad, but certainly different, and while the gameplay leaves a bit to be desired, it takes a back seat so it really won't bother you. I would recommend this game to anyone 9/10			",249,84,27,35,36,7,65

The Walking Dead sits firmly in what is the experience of this story told across graphic novels, the TV series, and this game. The game mechanics remind me, in a good way, of my childhood experiences with Choose Your Own Adventure books; the most notable difference that the choices not only affect your outcome, but the outcome of those that are surviving with you as well. TellTale's art style and storytelling are top notch, and the experience is worth the price of admission, in my opinion. They are definintely setting the bar for episodic game entertainment.

Сюжет немного пересекается с сериал, но действительно немного, поэтому даже не думайте, что игра эта по сериалу и посмотрев его вы всё будете знать-это не так. Графика тут рисованная в стиле Бордерландс и скажу вам прямо-это круто. Даже те, кто не любит данный стиль игр, будет играть в неё из-за сюжета.			",122,6,7,8,4,2,10

												This would be the 2012 game of the year for me. Some people argue that the price is too high but I disagree. Because of the amount of choices you can make, you can replay a completely different storyline bringing up replay value. With Telltale's Sick B*****dism running aground the choices you make, you feel emotionaly invested. Also, because it has an almost completely different cast of characters, Glenn and Hershel are the only exeptions, Telltale has the ability to throw them into any situation. Did I mention the score this game offers? The songs fit tremendously well with whatever emotion is being convayed. With great story-telling, scares, emotional investment, music, and blood-pumping action, I give this a...                           -9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Minimal action but sometimes you have to react fast and it makes you jump with a shot of adreneline. Interesting how the show differs from the game (which is supposed to be true-er to the comic).I probably wouldn't play if I wasn't a huge zombie nerd and a total WD show fanatic. But since I am this is a lot of fun in a unique way.			",47,26,0,18,6,2,8

												Based on the Kirkman graphic novels rather than the TV show, Telltale's The Walking Dead represents a shift in tone for the company, from comedy adventure game necromancers to gut-punching best-of-a-bad-situation simulators!The focus is on a strong narrative that runs through the season, with hard decisions & character development front and centre. Gameplay mostly consists of mild (often guided) exploration, rudimentary inventory management and in-context quick-time events, which serves its function of moving the story along between locations and disasters.If you are a fan of any facet of The Walking Dead (TV or graphic novel) then this is indispensable.

												I played this game many moon ago when it released on 360 and recently purchased it on STEAM to play through once again. It is one of my personal favorite games. While having zombies in it, the fun doesnt come from cracking their heads (although there is plenty of it). The game is based around the relationships and interactions you have with the NPCs through the decisions you make during tough situations. You will both make and burn bridges with characters. You only hope you didnt side with the guy that gets killed ten minutes later and are stuck dealing with the guy you sided against for rest the game. As you will find if you play the game, the living can be much more dangerous than the dead. 12-15 Hours (more if you buy ""400 days"" episode) playthrough depending on how much stuff you examine. Its a great game, with an amazing story (that your choices help write), that is very different from other ""Zombie"" titles out there!			",57,6,1,9,2,0,4

												Hats off to the best story game ever!TL;DR version available below.The Walking Dead is an episodic interactive drama graphic adventure video game developed and published by Telltale Games. Based on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead comic book series, the first season consists of five episodes and having some extra episodes only available with the 400 Days DLC. There's later The Walking Dead Season 2 aswell, so buy that aswell if you're planning to buy this one.The game takes place in the same fictional world as the comic, with events occurring shortly after the onset of the zombie apocalypse in Georgia. However, most of the characters are original to the game, which centers on university professor and convicted murderer Lee Everett, who helps to rescue and subsequently care for a young girl named Clementine. Telltale did an awesome job creating such a brilliant game. They've maintained the level of story and gameplay so that you won't notice any flaws. Unlike many graphic adventure games, The Walking Dead does not emphasize puzzle solving, but instead focuses on story and character development. The story is affected by both the dialogue choices of the player and their actions during quick time events (QTE). If you aren't good with QTE games, it'll take you quite a time to do finish any objective then.There's everything in this game, which goes from good scene to disturbing one, tense one, or the heart breaking. It's one a hell enjoying story I've ever played. I wouldn't mind buying another series by Telltale because I love how they made this, those graphical works, environment, and stuff, all are best.Rating: 9.9/10TL;DR If you want to enjoy an awesome story line and wanted to get emotional in real life, you should try this out.

												One of the best story driven games I have ever played. The decisions you have to make are heavy and intense. Every chapter offers new twists and turns. The gameplay is a simple point and click, with some action variety thrown in, but don’t let that turn you away. The animation can be a bit choppy/stiff at places, but this game is a complete 10/10 in my book and I would recommend anyone with an interest in a beautiful story driven experience to pick up and play this game.

												I can't believe it's taken me so long to play this. If there's one thing I love in games, it's immersion, and The Walking Dead absolutely nails it. It feels like you're watching a far better written version of the show, plus you get to make the extremely tough decisions, making you relate with the characters like never before. Please do buy this!			",100,25,2,12,8,2,14

												The Walking Dead is an interesting visual novel/point and click type of game. When I first went into it I thought it was about  talking to my group and trying to change their fates through our interactions. I was horribly disappointing to realize no matter what you do or what you say, the outcome is always the same. There is a huge amount of ""illusion of choice"" There is one point in the game where you have to choose between saving this guy or saving this girl. When you save one, the other dies and the story goes in a different direction and encourages replaying the game! Right? Wrong. Not twenty minutes later, the person you save dies anyways. In the end no matter your choice, both end up dead. There was no choice! This pattern continued through the whole game, I'd be promoted with a choice and the inevitable would eventually happen. I finished the game with a bad taste in my mouth. That is until I saw a discussion online about Kenny, one of the characters. The thread started off with someone saying how awesome Kenny was.He always had your back, was friendly, sacrificed himself, he was cool. I agreed. However most people in the thread said he was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I was completely in disagreement! They were even listing quotes he NEVER said in the game! That was when it hit me. The events of the game are unchangeable but the characters and the way they interact with you is completely different for each player depending on your choices. Kenny was a nice guy in my game but a jerk in many other people's games. It made discussion about the game a ton of fun since everyone's experience with each character was completely different. Some characters tell some players things other players will never hear them say.Sure the events were out of your control but that kind of game would be a little high budget for Telltale, so I think what they pulled off was pretty well done all things considered. My advice is do NOT go into the game with the thought that you can change the outcome of certain character's gruesome fates, but you can change their personalities, and compare the differences and similarities between your characters and your friend's characters' personalities. Your ""best bro"" in your game could be your friend's biggest rival or worst enemy!			",24,13,0,2,3,1,2

												Telltale's The Walking Dead is based on the canon of the hit TV Show and graphic novel series.  It is a point-and-click adventure game with quicktime elements - and it's a very good one.  The narrative, storytelling, and characterization is top notch and if one can refer to a story as ""heavy"" this game is more like having a pickup truck sitting on your chest.  It's a prime example of interactive storytelling and is an excellent model of how you can use the gaming medium to convey a story to an audience - even the camera angles it utilizes were wonderful, from staring at your reflection in a puddle as you beat someone's brain in to adding tension by having a skewed angle while you climb a ladder.  The game did have some pitfalls that comes with the point-and-click genre that it didn't avoicd unfortunately - repeatedly viewing things instead of acting on them/with them, repeating dialogue options accidentally without the ability to skip them, a few character and graphics glitches (I vividly remember speaking to an invisible Vernon and Kat cradling an invisible Duck in her arms) but besides a 4th wall breaking comic intervention these small negatives don't detract too much from the story as a whole.  The plot is very adult in nature and the gore and heavy themes are what you'd expect from a ""Walking Dead"" branded product.  What I found most interesting was the ""illusion of choice"" that seemed to be woven throughout the game.  Many people complain that every dialogue option and every choice you make should have an effect on the outcome of the game and many do; however, there are more than several situations in the game where no matter what you do something is going to go down in a certain way - many times in a way that could shock you.  As such, I recommend playing this game by the seat of your pants, don't reload, don't try again.  It's a more rewarding experience in the end since probably that one thing you didn't want to happen is going to happen regardless of what actions you take.  This can be seen as a pro or a con depending on your personality.  I find it a plus, as it allows Telltale's writers to weave a tighter narrative that has a much larger effect on the viewer than if everything turned into sunshine and rainbows for you (which is not going to happen anyway).  Leave it for a second playthrough if you must, but imagine this game as more interacting with a movie that you can steer around as you please to explore the world and interact with the characters in.  SPOILER FOLLOWS - Finally the ending wasn't too fulfilling to me, it almost seems like Telltale was holding back for a future release.  I would have liked to see how your 'parenting' options throughout the episodes effected Clem, and allowed you to see what kind of person she becomes after the credits roll.  Even if her actions post ending were in a montage format that would have been fine, allowing you to see if Clem can survive in this world with the lessons you've taught her. /SPOILERSPros:Great storytelling (narrative, themes, camerawork, ""whole-package"", etc.)Heavy, adult themes Cons:Minor point-and-click pitfallsEnding didn't ""wrap up"" to my satisfactionSome characters (while good) felt a little static or seemed to be only ""plot-devices""Even though I wasn't too impressed with the ending and the cons *appear* to outlist the pros this game is definitely worth a playthrough.  The story is great and this game is a great entrance for any gamer into interactive storytelling and what poing-and-click adventure games can be. B+			",711,211,14,90,55,8,86

												A fabulous game that's truly engaging from start to finish even if you have no prior knowledge of the series from the graphic novels or television show. An amazingly rich story with many meaningful characters. This story is about survival--and you never can quite feel safe--but that just adds to the realism of what one might imagine a Zombie Apocalype would be like. I love games with very meaningful storylines--where your choices matter and have consequences--and this is one of the best. Also, because zombies.			",44,21,1,17,3,0,9

												First of all, if you think that this game is like your traditional point n click game (like Nancy Drew) then this game is not the game your looking for because Telltale Series game are a bit more than just point n click, You control the actions, relationships and dialogoues of the characters in the story.  The Walking Dead is a Telltale Game Series where your decisions affect the flow of the story and not the actual ending itself. You decide what dialogues you see fit for the situation and the actions you choose affects your relationship towards the other characters.If you want to embody your own personality into the protagonist (Lee Everett) then go for it. You might even know what it feels like to make tough decisions and what it feels to make big sacrifices. This game is not just choosing dialogues but also interacting with the environment. (but not like Nancy Drew)The story is totally very good. It would make you feel like your watching the series itself. The ending is very sad and touching. It can make you shed tears.This game is really worth buying but I recommend that you buy it when it's on sale (preferrably a daily deal) so that you'll be able to buy the DLC and Season 2 for a cheaper price.The 400 Days DLC is not worth its price since it's quite very short for the 5 additional characters but what's good about it is that the actions you chose on Season 1 and 400 days will be carried over to Season 2. That's why it's worth buying Season 1, 400 Days and Season 2 altogether. Overall, it's a great game with a totally touching story. By the way, I'm not a fan of the series but I highly recommend it to everyone.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 10/10Music: 10/10Overall: 9.8/10			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

												As a standalone game, The Walking Dead is excellent. I specifically say standalone, as there is a sequel, and it's very obvious from the ending of the first one that there was more story left to tell. Unfortunately, the sequel shames the greatness of the first game. So, if you're able to enjoy the game on its own merits, despite the emptiness from the story not being continued after the final episode, I would definitely recommend it.The Walking Dead is in many ways a story first, then a game. The main interactivty comes in with adjusting the way the story goes to your liking. The player character, Lee, can be as compassionate, morally grey, or obnoxious as you like, despite the presence of his moral compass so to speak, the young girl Clementine, whose parents have been lost to the zombie apocalypse. Granted, Lee will still show he cares a great deal for Clementine even if you make him a complete jerk, but you can still play him in a way that'd make it seem like poor Clementine would be better off without him. If you try to play the compassionate route, all the moral dilemmas that the zombie apocalypse throws at you may make you realise that doing the right thing isn't always so clear!It should be made clear, this is a story that revolves around the characters, as does the interactivty. Do not expect major branching, or even really much branching at all, in the plot. But do expect some variety in how long certain characters stick around and how they act towards Lee depending on what you have him say and do. Chances are, you're going to come out of this game wondering just how confident you are in your own morals.The biggest flaw of the game as it stands on its own is by far the lack of bug removal. You probably won't run into anything major playing through it once, but if you replay it, which isn't exactly an odd choice when I've played through it about 8 times and still haven't seen everything, you become more likely to have your save messed up, or the cursor refusing to go all the way to the right of the screen, and so on. On a technical level it's appalling how little Telltale cared.If you can get past the fact it doesn't really feel like a complete story due to the lack of a good second season, the fact your choices only affect characters to a degree, and the horde of bugs, this is a good game. Hell, before the second season really went to crap during its final two episodes, I barely had a bad thing to say about this game, the main gripe really is that its sequel is so bad. If you want an extremely immersive, gripping, emotional interactive story, this may be a good place to look!			",14,15,0,3,1,0,1

												This game has one of the best stories your ever going to find. I really wish I connected with the characters a little more because I've heard many people ended up crying at the end and yes I think it was really sad, but I think I lost the connection from some ""puzzle"" sections of the game where you have to solve problems and collect items. Some of these sections I just found really frustrating and couldn't do what I would do if the situation was real life. The choices you get to make during the game are super awesome and it shows you what other players picked at the end of each episode which is an awesome addition. Don't let this review keep you from buying the game, it's a really great experience just not perfect.			",39,7,4,1,3,0,0

												I have now just finished the very final eposide, and I felt I needed to write up a new recommendation here. This game is one of the best I've ever played, to be honest. The shining beacon that guides the game home is ofcourse the absolutely outstanding writing. The story and the characters are amazing, and I can honestly say it has made me cry quite a few times. But it's also made me laugh, and cheer, and given me the goosebumps. It is without a doubt one of the most engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences ever, and you should not even hesitate with playing it.  The ending was superb, but I won't spoil anything for you. The story is the main factor here, so you really need to experience it for yourself to understand why I love it so much. The only thing I think I can pray for now is that Telltale continues on to make a second season. I don't want to leave this world, I have grown so incredibly fond of it!			",994,296,27,120,82,12,159

												“So, you think you’re strong, right?You think you can last longer, take more pressure. You know what’s best for yourself as well as for the people around you. Right?Right. Let’s put you to the test.”That’s what The Walking Dead is essentially about. What we’re looking at is… †checks her game record† …a 14-hour game-movie-story. For most people this will be an exceptionally intense experience. This is far less about standard gaming than it is about storytelling, & the story being told will put you through a handful. That’s what it means to do. As the story unfolds you’re confronted with many decisions, most of which are neither easy to make nor to be taken lightly. Nearly all of them you have to make under genuine pressure. The game doesn’t judge; this is up to yourself. It, however, observes carefully. Even though not all of your decisions seem to have a massive & immediate influence on what happens next, everything you do is noted.The Walking Dead as a story has quite a radical way of handling its protagonists. Something similar you might get to see in a horror movie… The game doesn’t make much of an effort to wait for you to catch up. The pressure is on everyone; on the people inside the story as well as on you, the outsider playing the game. It’s a good thing that there are several chapters/episodes, & finishing one of them does not, immediately push you into the next. So you get breathers. Time to think, time to look back, even a chance to actually go back in time & do things differently if you so decide. It’s still furiously intense, fiercely confrontational. If you make your way through this & it makes you feel like you just got pushed through a mixer, don’t worry; everything’s purrfectly fine. So you think you’re strong. Right? You think you’re a toughie, a hero, a leader. Right? Then go ahead, try this. You'll have to prove it to this story.-†kali			",27,9,0,7,2,0,2

												It's an engrossing storytelling experience. The voice acting and body language are good, the art is good, and the characters keep ending up in new situations to be uncomfortable about. Gameplay-wise, it's a pretty simple point-and-click adventure with trappings of choose your own adventure on top, and some quicktime events for action; not that special really. But still, as a CGI show with little things to make for a more personal single viewer experience, it's pretty great. Especially the episodes other than #3.			",272,85,2,39,30,1,78

Seeing post-apocalyptic life from another person's point of view and being helpless to physically aid them adds to the desire to make the best choices possible to help them survive. I loved it the first time around and am now running through it again to see the different outcomes. I would highly recommend this game to anyone considering it.			",18,5,0,7,4,0,18

												The Walking Dead is not another zombie game, it's a game that happened to have zombie apocalypse in it but main focus is on characters. Game explores interactions in a closed group of people and you often are forced to make hard decisions whenever you like it or not. What i noticed early on that not every stranger you meet in game is honest or open with you. Often you'll be faced with situations that requires somekind of trust and you just cannot trust someone for whatever reason. Everything you do or say has consequences in one way or another and sooner or later you'll have to face them. At the end of every chapter you get little chart showing your choices and what other players picked. Main protagonist is Lee. A black guy who has a secret which he (you) can reveal to the rest of group or not. Lee early on in the game finds a little girl Clementine. After Lee finds Clem he promises her to find her parents and they travel together from then on. Even though Lee isn't Clementine's dad he sure does care about her like it's his own daughter, giving her symphaty and tips when she need it. The game is worth to play just to see how those two interact. Also note that Clementine isn't boring nor annoying for a child character. Possibly best portrayed child character ever in video games. Overall I'd give this game 10/10 even though this doesn't feel like a ""real"" game but I have to question what is a game? This is exemplar of ""chose your own adventure"" book. Story has great pacing, nice soundtrack and tension where it's needed. It is unbelievable how good this game story is so I highly recommend to play it for everyone even those who don't play many games. ",61,11,0,4,2,0,2

												Lots of nice situations, often times without the option you would want.. but what do you expect - and it all goes down alright for the sake of story.The game is quite good, quite lengthy and the final chapter quite impressed me. I enjoyed it as a whole and I recall a lot of it despite playing the 5 seasons over approximately 18 months.There are some great characters and some great situations. The game holds your hand a lot, but it's mainly a story-telling experience anyway - the only issue I had with the gameplay was the lengthy *actions* that can trigger if I clicked something twice, which you might do if you think that your character (Lee) might have the same insight you have (not often the case). Nonetheless, the game is fun and I recommend you play it, though probably picked up on a good sale tbh.My biggest peeve was that a good number of episodes were driven by character interactions between your group, but the game never presented me with the option I wanted (namely who I should be accusing). I found it weird as much of the game was about managing relationships AND ACCUSATIONS, but the time that I most wanted to accuse somebody of the poison that saw massive change (and the loss of the single group member that I wanted to keep), there was no option to remove the single most destructive group member (my opinion for a while before that happened, and ultimately proven by the end of the game to be your *worst* team member).I hope Telltale Games grow a pair and tell their funding groups that they want to make a more ambitious game. From what I've heard, they may already have done so.			",169,24,2,28,41,3,57

												I can't recommend this game enough.  I didn't find any bugs and the story truly morphs (to certaine extent of course) to adapt to specific choices.  As an adventure game it didn't meet the thrills of puzzle solving, but it did bring a new level of atmosphere in storytelling within a video game.  I don't think I've been this emotionally involved when playing a video game.  This game helps breach the gap between games and movies.  Excellent game, go play it.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												The walking dead is an adventure game but surely it isn't the kind you would expect it. The game play is based on your rather fast responses throughtout the game and your very often quick decisions that decide how to game play will carry on. The game is very well done when it comes to pretty much all the aspects. The game will genuinely make you care about some of the characters in the game and what happens to them when the story continues, the game will surely make you emotional.  Walking dead is a game i would highly recommend to anyone its a 10/10.			",179,29,6,14,13,0,5

												As a fan of the first season of the show, I really wanted this game to work. It was recommended to me as a great story driven game with deep charcters. And it is exactly that, but more!Not really enjoying this genre - I was beyond pleasantly suprised with the game! It made me reconsider my thoughts on the genre as a whole.The word as we all know it has ended. Zombie craziness has ensued. You are Lee, you are riding in the back of a police car when the game begins. You'll find a small child and become responsible for her and here is where the similarities between your playthrough and mine will end!Your game will be shaped by the choices you make, or don't make, the things you say, or don't say and the people you save, or don't...The game has an understandably small cast, because, you know, the world has ended.The charcters you encounter are well written and believable. Resulting in sometimes agonising choices that need to be made. I found myself really caring about the charcters and wanting to do what's best for them all. This is a credit to the game designers who have done an outstanding job with designing them .As Lee you will have limited time to read through the choices and shape the game you want to play. This game will demand a reply if only to find out what would have happened if you'd said something different at that critical moment!Decisions I made in the first episode are coming back to haunt me even now, in the middle of episode 4!Although there are no real brain crushing puzzels to be found, there are a few basic ones to be solved and that's fine.The puzzles never get too trying or boring and are broken up very nicely by bludgeoning, slashing, stabbing and a general variety of very satisfying zombie killsA great introduction to the genre and a great game in general too!

												The Walking Dead is one of those games that really draws you in. You get so involved with the story, you get attached to the characters. I would recommend this game to anyone whether you like The Walking Dead series itself or whether you're just a fan of zombies.I will warn you though, you might need some tissues because it is an emotional rollercoaster!10/10 - A great game from Tell-Tale. One that I certainly won't forget.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game was very enjoyable and I loved every minute of it. The timer was a cool add to the game also. i had liked that too.

												I never was very fond of zombies. I only watched the first and half of the second season of The Walking Dead TV-show and each other (post-)apocalyptic scenario (as War against Machines, Nuclear Holocaust, Alien Invasion or global Eco-Disaster) I prefer over a zombie apocalypse - both in real life and in video games. But if you are interested in a strong narrative and a video game triggering emotions like a great movie would do, then there is no way around Telltale's The Walking Dead. The gameplay is minimalistic. You click on already highlighted objects/persons to push the story forward but not to solve any puzzles or riddles or fill your inventory as you may expect from an adventure game. Even ""Heavy Rain"" was more of a game than The Walking Dead is, but this is interactive storytelling at its best.The great voice-acting makes all the characters you meet reasonable and authentic. Actually Melissa Hutchison (who speaks Clementine) won the “Best Performance by a Female"" at the 2013 Spike Video Games Awards.Oh well, talking about Clementine. Usually children in video games are just plain annoying or they are drawn in an unlikely precocious way acting like adults with their bodyscale set to 0.6. Not so here. I can't imagine the cold-hearted kitty-slaying villain you have to be to not care about Clementine and do whatever it takes to guide her safely through this horror. It broke my heart when we had to part.So eventually you will figure that all your gameplay- and dialogue choices won't even change the outcome of the story but just how your fellow companions stand towards you and whether if they like you or not. And maybe that is the most important lesson we can distill off The Walking Dead for the upcoming apocalypse – both in real life and in video games.First playthrough: ~15 hrs.Here is a three episode mini-series from Extra Credits about various topics relating to Telltale's The Walking Dead.

												Never thought I'd see anything top the experience of Mass Effect so soon. I have only played through this game once, but you could feel how the game not only set you in front of a choice but also expected you to deal with it. No good, no bad, just ""hope you can live with the consequences"", all with a story that you can't help but get emotionally invested in (keep tissues nearby). The game reflects on and compares your decisions throughout the game with gathered data from Telltale at the end of every episode if you have an internet connection.The game focuses on story, in the purest way I've ever seen a game execute it. It still clings a little too much to the pace-killing puzzles of the Monkey Island era, but the puzzle areas are generally very small (the probably largest area in the game is a hallway, two rooms and a backyard) and the usual ""use every item on every item on the screen until something happens"" procedure is simplified by the compact and confined GUI.Other than that, you spend most of your time talking to people and watching cutscenes. Many cutscenes involve quicktime events to reenforce that you have to take account of your actions and promises. Have you promised to shoot someone? The game puts you back in control and expects you to pull the trigger with a mouse click.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a guy in your party? You better defend yourself by smashing Q when he jumps on your throat.Dialogs are often timed too to add to the tension, and give you the option to willingly stay silent when they are. In my opinion, the silent option adds very well to the immersion in a couple of conversations where none of the other options could accurately express what I/my character was thinking. The writing of the dialogs and the voice acting are excellent and create believable characters.The game is very consistent and not only respects your choices, but also has some of the characters remember very well what you do. For example, you can be caught if you lie and contradict yourself in a later conversation. I've found no immersion or cohesion breaking bugs (Concelor Anderson anyone?), the game generally does a very good job at keeping the Fourth Wall intact once you've become used to the quicktime events.I think games are still figuring out how to perform incredible storytelling and The Walking Dead delivers an experience that I'm looking forward to see serving as an inspiration for a new generation of adventure games. I recommend this game wholeheartedly to everyone who is not ashamed of crying in front of a computer screen.P.S. I also highly recommend watching the Extra Credits Mini-Series on this game, starting with this one:

												The Walking Dead just an amazing adventure-horror game.Even If i didn't watch the TV-series it was awesome.The graphic are a little bit like a comic. Sound and atmosphere fits very good into the story. The controls are easy. The puzzle's are not so hard but also not too easy.A game where the characters and the story is on top. The characters are well written and you will connect with them. The dialogs between them are brilliant. There are some brutal, deep & very emotional scenes.The story is just heart touching. It changes by your choices, there are many hard ones where you need to think and you only have a certain time to choose. I don't think there is a right or wrong choice, everyone has its own and you will see the consequences later. The main story won't be affected from this choices.The Walking Dead has one of the best storys i've ever played, better than most movies. It took me 11+ hours to finish this incredible game.Everyone who are thinking of buying it, you will not regret it.Thanks to Telltale Games.Rate: 10/10			",13,6,0,0,0,1,0

												It is hard to evaluate The Walking Dead as a game because it is so story driven; I feel like I am reviewing the story more than the game. I would describe this title as an interactive movie. The story is quite good and each character has a very definitive and well realized personality. The voice acting is fantastic. There is a lot of dialogue and decision making rather than killing zombies and action (the latter certainly happens, just not in large doses). Sometimes the story does drag a bit and one of the episodes was flat out boring. Overall, nice production and good piece of storytelling. 9/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			",66,50,1,8,4,0,7

												This game is beautifull. The characters are so well writen, and consistant in thier personalities. The choices feel meaningfull and have effects 2 or 3 episodes down the line. The smaller choices do affect how poeple interact with you. Not to mention the great storyline, and the beautifull relationship between Lee and Clementine, and the tragic and beautiful ending. The fact the end of this game made an emotionless monster like me cry is commendable, and i cannot recommed it enough. It has the perfect blend of Story, Action and Emotion. 10/10			",89,9,1,20,14,0,19

												A beautiful game with an even better story. You play as protagonist Lee with your 'sidekick' Clemintine as you both attempt to survive through the zombie appocolypse discovering the real enemy not to be the dead but the living. The story is catered to how you play and the choices you make- I wouldn't recommend it so much for the gameplay as it is heavily reliant on quick time events. It reminds me of the 'pick your own ending' novels that I would read when I was younger. A game for those who want to invest in a story rather than gameplay and high tech graphics.

												The Walking Dead is a fantastic game. It's got a great storyline, excellent character development, and fantastic gameplay. But you shouldn't go into this game expecting a lot of action because, while it IS suspenseful, it isn't centered around action. It's more of an interactive story, just like any other Telltale game. Overall, I would recommend this game to anybody who's looking to play an amazing game with a lasting impression.			",144,21,3,27,15,2,11

												I..... actually cried. I had doubts that I would but I honestly cried.An incredible game, unique but played for its story. The choices you make really do affect things. I commonly regret my decisions that I made, just as you might in real life. The suspense and action are just enough and things aren't too fast paced, nor do they get boring.Overall a great game, so far only done one playthrough, I'll do another one later to see the different things that I can do.

												Скажу сразу-игра хорошая и интересная. Хотя её вполне можно назвать мыльцом и на телевизоре с джостиком в руках в неё играть лучше, однако даже с ПК вам она доставит не мало удовольствий. Сюжет немного пересекается с сериал, но действительно немного, поэтому даже не думайте, что игра эта по сериалу и посмотрев его вы всё будете знать-это не так. Графика тут рисованная в стиле Бордерландс и скажу вам прямо-это круто. Даже те, кто не любит данный стиль игр, будет играть в неё из-за сюжета.			",122,6,7,8,4,2,10

The Walking Dead sits firmly in what is the experience of this story told across graphic novels, the TV series, and this game. The game mechanics remind me, in a good way, of my childhood experiences with Choose Your Own Adventure books; the most notable difference that the choices not only affect your outcome, but the outcome of those that are surviving with you as well. TellTale's art style and storytelling are top notch, and the experience is worth the price of admission, in my opinion. They are definintely setting the bar for episodic game entertainment.

												this game is a must-have! actually it´s more an interactive movie than a game. the story is brilliant with several twists and really tough decisions, some of them you have to take under (time) pressure, which is pretty thrilling. during the game and especially at the end of the chapters i catched myself repeatedly just being amazed of how the story really touched me beyond the zombie apocalypse. you can´t go wrong with this game, just don´t expect an action FPS, rather be prepared to lean back and let the story suck you in.

												Lots of nice situations, often times without the option you would want.. but what do you expect - and it all goes down alright for the sake of story.The game is quite good, quite lengthy and the final chapter quite impressed me. I enjoyed it as a whole and I recall a lot of it despite playing the 5 seasons over approximately 18 months.There are some great characters and some great situations. The game holds your hand a lot, but it's mainly a story-telling experience anyway - the only issue I had with the gameplay was the lengthy *actions* that can trigger if I clicked something twice, which you might do if you think that your character (Lee) might have the same insight you have (not often the case). Nonetheless, the game is fun and I recommend you play it, though probably picked up on a good sale tbh.My biggest peeve was that a good number of episodes were driven by character interactions between your group, but the game never presented me with the option I wanted (namely who I should be accusing). I found it weird as much of the game was about managing relationships AND ACCUSATIONS, but the time that I most wanted to accuse somebody of the poison that saw massive change (and the loss of the single group member that I wanted to keep), there was no option to remove the single most destructive group member (my opinion for a while before that happened, and ultimately proven by the end of the game to be your *worst* team member).I hope Telltale Games grow a pair and tell their funding groups that they want to make a more ambitious game. From what I've heard, they may already have done so.			",169,24,2,28,41,3,57

												This is the first review I've done where I'm gonna be completely straight with everyone.This game is f'ing amazing. Even at full price, buy it. It has loveable characters, heartbreaking tragedies, and choices that will break your heart into millions of tiny shards. But I love it. Not many games can make you feel the way this one did. You may not love the concept or the playstyle, but I guarentee you will love the people. I had never played a Telltale game before this, but now I want to give them every dollar I have. They make amazing content and characters. You will never play a more heartbreakingly beautiful game in your life.As a survivor I can only give you a small bit of advice. 1: Keep Clementine safe, she doesn't deserve any of this. 2: Take care of yourself, you're not invincible either. Good luck out there. Make good choices, be happy with your choices, save Clementine.			",51,14,0,11,8,1,5

												Having completed the story only minutes ago, I can barely see enough to write this review.  The tears, make them stop! Brilliantly executed storyline.  Fantastic game.  More of an interactive movie than a game and a damn fine one at that.  I admittedly was a bit jaded from the TV series partly because (in my very humble opinion) I liked so few of the characters.  Thus, I held off on trying this one out even though I bought it well over a year ago.  If only the show was as well written as this game.  It was near perfection!Some of the choices you're forced to make are just gut wrenching.  The game was far more disturbing than I imagined it would be and that factor only contributed to the experience.Very much looking forward to season 2.  I need a few days to recover because my feels are damaged, badly.Play this, you won't regret it.  Huge props to the developer!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not heavy in gameplay, Walking Dead is very much about the ambiguities of 'right' and 'wrong' choices and consequently a reader can find themselves quite easily lost in the narrative. I consider the game a triumph for narrative in the medium of video games.			",103,40,0,12,7,1,19

												This is one of the best story games I have ever played, it might not be like GMod, CS:GO or GTA V but it's amazing, one of the best of it's genre, pretty much all computers could run it! My computer can't run most games on 60 frames, but this game did just that, the least fps I saw was 20 and that was for a split second when the game was loading. In this game you control someone called Lee Everett, at the beginning of the game you are in a car with a cop because you did a crime, you murdered a guy that was sleeping with your wife (That pretty much doesn't matter in the whole game,but it does get brought up a few times} And in the car the cop is asking you questions and turns around to look at you, best driver of 2016 right? And when he does so a walker/zombie is walking across the street and you crash, later on you meet a girl called Clementine and so on, you meet other survivors such as Larry and Kenny, don't want to spoil too much so that's all I'm gonna say, in this game there are 5 ""Episodes"". these are just parts of the game, in every episode you have to make a decision, there's always at least one big decision, and some small choises in dialouge, whenever you speak to someone you get 4 or less choises to say, you can actually change relationships in the game, if you were nice to someone, they'll be your friend (No♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock) but you can also be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to them,  the game doesn't have much action but it's still amazing I've had this game for about 5 hours but it's still amazing, I would recommend getting it on G (2) A because it's less than 4 dollars there :D (It doesn't allow me to put those letters together,  the first letter is g, then it's 2, then it's a then it's .com) Have fun :D(This is pretty much the tl;dr)Pros:Can run on almost any computer at 60 fpsYou can change the way other people think about youGood storyGood characters (If one dies chances are you'll cry)Inbetween:Emotional at some partsCons:Not much actionGame is quick			",111,11,1,10,4,0,2

You will become attatched to the characters, especially the main character, and you will be forced to watch how the game plays out while you make spontaneous, on the spot decisions. You will laugh, you will cry and you'll be in shock throughout the game.

												This game is absolutely wonderful. I'm a big fan of TWD, both the comics and the show, and this certainly lived up to expectations. Even though I told myself throughout my whole first playthrough not to get attached to any character (because seriously, it's The Walking Dead - we all know what happens to our favorite characters), I still did and the ending still pretty much ruined my life.When playing through this, I definitely recommend not going back to change anything your first playthrough. Even though I hated some of the choices I made at the time, it definitely made the whole experience more enjoyable. I recently replayed it on a different save right before the release of Season 2 just to see where other choices would have gotten me and it was just as amazing the second time even though I knew everything that was going to happen.

The overall visuals is great as it has a heart wrenching storyline that are truly unforgettable. This game feel more like a movie where the choices really make a great deal of differences, Although the difficulty of the gameplay is quite low, the decisions that i have to make is consider very difficult. I highly recomend this game to people who enjoy post-apocalypse type of game with great storyline and also to top it off, the awesome voice actors in the game...I'm looking forward to The walking Dead Season 2			",3,3,0,0,1,0,0

												+ Great story+ Realistic and graphic world+ Forces you to make tough choices- Annoying quick time events don't add anythingNot really a game, but an interactive story, so be warned, there is almost no gameplay here! Very compelling story, which forces you to make tough choices, that make you wonder what would happen if you had chosen differently. After each chapter, it shows you how your choices compared to everyone else who played the game, which is cool. Turns out I'm kind of a jerk, lol. In the end though, the results are always the same. I won't give anything away, but it turns out some of your gut-wrenching decisions don't really matter because certain events have to happen to push the story down the rails it's on. However, your choices affect how those events play out, which is satisfying. It's loaded with quicktime events that try to make you feel like part of the action, but I found them to be annoying. Why bother making me sit up and mash a button every 15 minutes or so after I just got comfy in my chair? Loved the art, which made it feel like a comic book. Great soundtrack, too. Very atmospheric.84/100A great story that explores some very grim realities if humanity was ever faced with a viral epidemic. Should have just focused on being a choose-your-own adventure than trying to force a 'game' element in. Not for the ADD crowd who like to skip cutscenes. ",122,58,1,25,15,5,23

												The Walking Dead isn't just ""a great videogame story."" No, it's simply ""a great story.""  Don't let the tired concept of zombies put you off this game. The zombie apocalypse is merely a delivery mechanism for incredibly written human drama on display. Life's never easy. Tough decisions must be made, and in a world already gone to hell where there is no good and bad or right and wrong, all you can do is own your choices and pray you and your friends can scrape your way through another night among the dead.

												Personal Rating: 10/10This game is a masterpiece. I played the Xbox version and picked it up on Steam because the Xbox version was a bit iffy. This review WILL NOT contain spoilers by the way. The story is beautifully crafted, a truly amazing narrative as you follow the survival of Lee Everett and a whole host of different characters, from redneck man, old man and nerd man. This team of rapscallians take on the world of zombies, people and possible death by boredom. The graphics are fantastic, using a cell shading sort of thing almost like Borderlands did, it fit's the game perfectly, I can't imagine the game having a different sort of graphical style at all. The choices you make in this game are excrutiatingly difficult to make and do have an impact, whether it be choosing between two people or giving out food to someone. While it's been a while since I played the third, fourth and fifth episodes, I do remember the choices you have to make.Another thing this game has, is the fact that it's possibly the first and only game to have made me cry and feel emotionally invested to such a large extent. It's amazing how they did this and I commend Telltale for this.It's a beautiful game and for the price it's at, it's like stealing food from a survivor. There is quite literally nothing wrong with this game, maybe the occasional bit of lag or stuttering but other than it's truly, truly marvellous.			",264,79,11,24,42,3,35

												Interesting story for fans of the show, even if characters are completely different a lot of the themes and challenges faced in the show also come up in the game.  More an adventure game with lots of story than a novel in my opinion but gameplay consists of collecting pieces of the story by choosing who and what to interact with, which does change the overall story though only in small ways which I know some find disappointing.  If not a fan of zombies and lore of the Walking Dead show and the challenges that brings it probably isn't as fun.			",714,281,6,120,55,5,125

												To anyone who hasnt picked this one up yet, doso. The walking dead is really one of the best games I have played in years. The tense story and well acted characters really just suck you into the world.    Really Just one of the best games available, and for 12.50$ or whatever its going for it is a fantastic deal.

This game is a story driven game that really does play on what choices you make. It seriously will play on your feels! Telltale games is amazing at telling stories and is very creative not making just a point and click game. They also do really cool tidbits at the end of each episode saying that this many people made this choice and that choice.			",188,53,1,12,8,2,6

												Good game and story. The producers and directors of the game know how to produce the feeling that you are in the game, creating the thought that you are actually in the ""zombie apocalypse"", not just playing, but living as Lee Everett. The many characters - and catastrophes - unfold a larger atmospheric gaming experience. I recommend this game, and to hell with the price, trust me here,  it''s certainly worth it			",26,3,0,3,2,0,3

												Now it may only show i have 2 hours but i also have this game on my xbox one(over 18 hours and 96% complete), and let me tell you ITS ADDICTINGFirst of allIf you do not like games where cutscenes take a while then you may not like this game.But its amazing story telling and characters are great.The ReviewWith over 18 hours on this game I'd like to say this is one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure of playing, the story is great, characters are amazing, but actually controling lee himself can be a bit of a time waster considering the slow walk speed of lee(and any other character)It has great atmosphere and has jumpscared me more than once!(which is great considering that hardly happens to me)With each episode the story gets better and better making you want to play more. And since the game is already fully out it is a great time to get it as it will leave you on the edge of your seat everytime you get to the end of a episode.In short i recommend this game			",40,2,0,6,6,1,1

NOTICE: This review was originally written for the Xbox 360 version of the game and may not entirely reflect the PC version. The full, unedited version of this review may be viewed HERE[www.trueachievements.com].Walk a Mile in Their ShoesTelltale Games is no stranger to adventure games, and The Walking Dead is no stranger to success lately. A rapidly growing zombie mythos, The Walking Dead has hit the media trifecta with this game: literature, film, and gaming. But can this last piece of the puzzle equal the overwhelming acclaim of its other pieces?Telltale's five episode series is self-admittedly more in tune with the Walking Dead comic books, and does not branch off of the television show. While set in the Walking Dead mythos, the plot and characters are original and unique. Furthermore, you do not even have to be a fan of the series in any form to appreciate this riveting, nerve-wracking journey. This review contains no spoilers but concerns the series as a whole, not the individual episodes. The review is broken up into segments with concise summaries immediately following each.GraphicsPros:-Decent graphics for the price-Style is reminiscent of comic series-What little user interface there is, is partially customizable to tailor to your playstyleCons:-Nothing spectacular, no stand-out locations, just-enough-for-the-job visualsSoundPros:-Voice actors exceptionally well suited for their respective characters-Script and acting for bulk of game is captivatingCons:-Cannot skip dialogue, meaning thorough players will rehear a lot of potentially bland scriptPlotPros:-Huge focus on plot leads to a captivating drama-Player choices can shape character opinions, dialogue, and cutscenes-Each episode delivers a powerful punch of plot, but also contributes to the plot as a wholeCons:-Hard pressed to think of anyGameplayPros:-Gameplay choices lead to a plot tailored for you-Rewind feature makes it possible to second-guess your choices, if unhappy with outcome-If connected to the internet, choice synopsis at end of each episode compares you to others-Control over dialogue, “struggle” sequences, and suspenseful sequences immerse the player-Simple enough to be enjoyed by casual Walking Dead fans looking to enjoy this title-Few to no glitches or bugsCons:-Hardcore adventure players may not be satisfied with the puzzles, or lack thereof-Players not fond of visual novels may dislike the large focus on dialogue and plot-Slow readers may struggle with timed dialogue choicesLength/Replay ValuePros:-Although short, delivers a powerful gaming experienceCons:-Not the best money-to-hours ratio-Very little replay value (full game – players may use rewind to experience different choices)Total Score: 8.2/10 ",240,53,17,35,35,4,28

												Despite its pretty simplistic gameplay, The Walking Dead has an incredibly gripping and engrossing storyline, with a wondeful cast of characters. Morally gray choices are the staple of the game, oftentimes putting you in a conflicted position to make a snap decision between survival and hurting the characters you care about. Fantastic game and highly recommended.			",265,63,4,54,62,3,64

												This is an amazing experience, now if you are looking for a ""game"" in the sense of ""shoot everything, go where you want etc."" then this isn't for you, stop reading, i'll wait...i said stop....DUDE I SAID, oh wait, u don't mind that? well lets continue shall we?This is an amazing Story based game (or interactive story based on your feelings), it keeps me wanting more and more to find out what was next.You Play a man called Lee Everett, you begin In a Police car for murder, after an acident you are thrown into this new zom-zom filled world (Fun times!)After looking for help you come across a young girl called Clementine, her parents are nowhere to be seen, and this is start of a great story.You will meet many great characters on your journey with Lee and Clem, some you will love and some you will hate, but the good thing is you care one way or the other.You will also have to make hard decisions, who gets to eat? what is the best course of action? why does duck not shut up? many things to be thought about.Will you do right for the group? Clem? Yourself? its up to you my friend (although if i hear you hurt my little girl i will hunt you down and get revenge....or ask for cookies as recompense)The only downside i would say to the steam version is the Full Price, seems a little bit high compared to PS3 and Xbox, however if you can grab it in a sale, or its sounds like your cup of tea, then please give this a go, i feel you won't regret it (or maybe you will, if you do then...oops, my bad i suppose)This is an amazing experience, my favorite game of all time and something that shows games don't need to permently put a gun in your hand to experience something, 10/10 from me.

												I cried,  cried real tears at the ending. Hot damn I haven't cried that bad since Marley and Me,Fantastic game, I loved it and if you're a fan of The Walking Dead then you'll love it too.There isn't too much in the way of gameplay, the action scenes take place in quicktime events which can be a little annoying as you'll die occaisionally but the main strength of this game is in the drama which is far better than any you will find in the TV shows (although maybe a little less mature than the novels or comics). Each of the five episodes will take you about two hours to complete so ten hours in all (even thoguh I got 13). However, I could see myself replaying this at least once or twice just to make different choices. I probably wouldn't pay full price but it's a must have in a sale (I got it at 75% off).

												TellTale's The Walking Dead is one of those rare gems of a game that has the ability to polarize and unify players simultaneously. Its story does not insist upon itself or attempt to be profound, simply human. The choices in the game are not metered by ""Good"" or ""Bad"", more so: ""Do"" or ""Die"". Definitely a game to experience and earns a place on the ""Games-To-Play-Before-You-Die"" list.			",80,16,0,6,9,1,5

												This game is awesome, i love it! I play for 3 days now and i am a believer now! A few quicktime-events are a bit clunky, but it works... and isn *t a game-breaker at all. Needed some time to addept to it, but now it works well for me.Best positive things to mention:Diverse and coulerfull charakters, everyone with personal goals you have, to deal with to hold the group together.Everything is fresh and new and is a totally new story, so you don *t play the story of the Tv-series. It 's just a little bit mixed up with characters you also find in the series, but the story unfolds in a different way so you get surprises and it 's hard to trust new group-members.I enjoyed every single moment i played the game, because everything you decide will cause meaningfull actions, so you really have do decide wisely and with caution.Little downside for me are the quicktime-events, i get along with now, but could be a bit more fluid.... and bit easier to handle. Sometimes, before you find the mouse-curser to aim on your foe you are already done, so you have to act quickly and accurate at the same time, or you are going to die. But these events happen not too often so it 's ok.Only moment yet, that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me totaly off was that i lost a very nice person, i tried to protect, because i liked the person very much and was to me the most trustwothy one. It seemed she was supposed to die and i didn 't find any way to save her live....even worse, it seems she didn 't do anything wrong.All thumbs up!! I keep my eyes on tell-tale-games now!

												The Walking Dead is a very good example of what can happen if the writing is good, the characters are strong and if the plot and execution of that plot is well done. You play as Lee Everette, a man who found himself stuck in a hopeless world full of despair and lost hope. Everything seems to suck for Lee, but then he found Clemintine, and then everything sucked a little less.See, Clemintine is the  definition of cute and she absolutely makes this game. She gives the player a reason to feel sorry and actually lets the player open up emotions to the people you meet along the way.This game deals with alot of mature themes like, drugs, murder, suicide,♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.But the one thing stands out is the fact that there aren't many ""happy"" moments and that is perfect in my opinion because this game is depressing.... in a good way though.The story wa amazing and the writing was brilliant however, the voice acting could have been alot better. The art style in this game is very nice and gives you a sense that your'e playing a comic book, wich you kind of are because this game was based on a comic book. If you like the tv show then it's possible that you will like this too.The Walking Dead isn't for everyone since there isn't much gameplay but I would recommend that you give this game a shot since it really deserves your money			",39,5,4,3,3,0,0

												I came into this game as not being a fan of point and click adventures. Games like Monkey Island bored me to tears, but being a fan of The Walking Dead TV show I thought I'd try it out.I have to say that as a fan I really enjoyed the story. I found the characters engaging and interesting. It was also nice to have somebody different from the TV show as the main protaganist.The puzzles are a little simplistic and tedious at times, but for me this was a good thing as they didn't frustrate and let me continue on with story.If your looking for a real challenge then look elsewhere, but if you want a different story in The Walking Dead universe then this should suit you just fine.

												What can I say? Probably the best Telltale-Game.If you like the ""Telltale formula"" and you like The Walking Dead (or at least zombie apocalypse scenarios) you will love this game.If you are not familiar with the new""Telltale formula"" it´s simple: Much story, good writen caracters and a little bit of gameplay... and the ilusion that your choises realy matter. ;)But don't get me wrong. If you get into this game the little issues will disappear so fast that they barely don't matter at all.For me it was one of the most emotional and best games I've ever played. If you can still talk hours about the game with friends after finishing it, the game has done a lot right.There is hardly any other game I can recommend as much as this. So give it a try, i'm sure you will not regret it.			",97,22,0,39,14,0,21

												Amazing game. If you want a game with a lot of action this is might not be for you, as it is based heavily on dialogue.  While you'll still trigger the same events in the game no matter what your choices, it is still nice to play a game that makes you feel responsible for your actions. This is easily a must-have, even if youre not a fan of any other Walking Dead media. I only have 2 main complaints though people yet to buy this game should look out for.1. Technical issues. They happen, although most won't notice them unless they know it's coming.2. Full season. Basically, you can't buy 1 episode and see if you like it, then buy the rest. Instead you have to buy the full season. If it's on sale for $6 something this won't matter, buy it. If you're considering getting it for full price (Which it's worth) you should have a full idea of what you're getting into.But I digress. These are really only small complaints in what is easily one of the best games of 2012 and an essential to anyone who is looking for a good story where they truly affect the people around them. 9.5/10 ",124,28,1,7,8,1,5

												Personal Rating: 10/10This game is a masterpiece. I played the Xbox version and picked it up on Steam because the Xbox version was a bit iffy. This review WILL NOT contain spoilers by the way. The story is beautifully crafted, a truly amazing narrative as you follow the survival of Lee Everett and a whole host of different characters, from redneck man, old man and nerd man. This team of rapscallians take on the world of zombies, people and possible death by boredom. The graphics are fantastic, using a cell shading sort of thing almost like Borderlands did, it fit's the game perfectly, I can't imagine the game having a different sort of graphical style at all. The choices you make in this game are excrutiatingly difficult to make and do have an impact, whether it be choosing between two people or giving out food to someone. While it's been a while since I played the third, fourth and fifth episodes, I do remember the choices you have to make.Another thing this game has, is the fact that it's possibly the first and only game to have made me cry and feel emotionally invested to such a large extent. It's amazing how they did this and I commend Telltale for this.It's a beautiful game and for the price it's at, it's like stealing food from a survivor. There is quite literally nothing wrong with this game, maybe the occasional bit of lag or stuttering but other than it's truly, truly marvellous.			",264,79,11,24,42,3,35

												Oh man. Okay, so hear me out. 'The Walking Dead' AMC's hit TV series is a huge thrill ride with character connections and diverse story lines. I bought this game because I figured I enjoy the TV series. I did not expect what I have witnessed playing through this game. Take up the role of the main protaganist, Lee while you battle out an adventure against walkers and look after a girl called Clementine right until the bitter end. Choosing and interpreting the game to see how you see fit with different speech and actions which alter the story you play completely. As I write this review my eyes are leaking and my fingers shaking. ""This game ♥♥♥♥ed me up, quite frankly"". Buy it or regret it. If you want an emotional thrill ride with intense action and anticipation who enjoys gameplay and mulitple story lines, buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥now. If you're a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, however, ♥♥♥♥ off back to Call of Duty or whatever♥♥♥♥♥♥you play. 37/10			",78,7,2,5,2,1,0

												T_T What a journey....Here's the game divided into segments.- Graphics 10/10Telltale using a comic style graphic design was the perfect choice for what it offers and it fits the mood. - Storyline 10/10Anyone who has played this game has had one of those moments where they tear up even just a little. The walking dead game was a joruney and a rollercoaster of emotions through out the whole 5 episodes. It has it's plot twists and a sad but beautiful ending that will make you want to try the season 2 of the walking dead which I suggest you buy. This game's story mode alone made the full price worth it.- Options 9/10I wish there would be more graphic options for the game and some more gameplay options but other than that it's good. Offers the obligatory subtitles option and plenty of options regarding hints and help.- Controls 8/10I had moments of frustration when I got couldn't move the camera to the way I was going and the keyboard controls in general in my opinion are weird. I definitely suggest using a controller for this one.- Gameplay 9/10As much as I liked the story the gameplay makes the game unique in it's own way and makes you want to play more of it.The choices you make in the game, the lines you choose, the people you trust make up the ending. There need to be more games in which you choose the path you take, will you go with the whole group or go alone? Will you kill this guy or walk away? It all matters, and that is what I like about this game. I expirienced a glitch at one point where I couldn't connect to the game even though it's a singleplayer game what fixed this issue was before clicking start upon launch I pressed Alt+Tab and it worked like a charm. - Final Verdict 10/10This is a must play game for everyone, I recommend this game for any gamer to try at sometime in their life.

Every aspect of this game is done so well (characters, voices, music, artwork etc) that when you get to the end, you will end up in tears.Huge powerful emotional impact that will leave you on the edge of your seat...Now off to buy Season Two!Sale or not, I recommend buying this game it's worth every cent. 10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an interesting game. The theme of zombies is overdone in the gaming industry but you don't get that feeling of ""ugh zombies"" in this game. You tend to think of it more as a survival situation. Although I didn't cry (most likely because I played the game over a time span of a day and a half) the bond between Clem and Lee is like no other. I felt an emotional connection to the pair especially when a certain soundtrack would play. It would remind me when Lee pushed Clem on a swing back at the dairy farm (traumatic flashbacks). I don't entirely like the art style although it definetly does set the game apart from others. Probably my favorite part is the decision making and the regrets that come after. It's fun to replay and see what different things can happen. Overall it's a pretty good game (aside from the random glitches...).			",14,2,1,0,5,0,1

												Cold, cruel, dark... how do I describe this game? No, this story? I just hope for one thing, and that is that no one has to ever experience the kind of emotional suffering involved for people in real life with real life decisions like choosing between lives to save or between your own welfare and your children's. No human should have to be forced to make those kinds of decisions. But that is exactly what this game forces you to do. Sure, you can stay silent during conversations, but you'll lose all respect.I played all five episodes, one each day, and I've just finished the last one. And I feel like I really don't want to play another Season. This game is not hard, it's brutal. I think about things like the apocalypse a lot, like what a world full of the living dead will be like, or a world where only you are alive. This game had me questioning, as I still do, the worth and value of human existence in times of prolonged suffering. Is there hope? Real hope? Or is that simply a mental mechanism to keep going and find a reason, however illogical, to keep living. What is the purpose of life, what are we living for? To raise up children, to just enjoy ourselves, to keep moving towards the inevitability of death? However unreal and farcical you may think a zombie apocalypse is, it acts as a compelling context for life questions.And not just that. It serves to seek out how we might react in a certain situation. Everyone has different personalities, and I'm sure you'd agree with me when I suggest that in this modern society, it's difficult to really know someone within a few days of meeting them. But when the world goes to absolute sh*t, there is no need for false impressions anymore. You can see people pretty square on. I had my brain in agony deciding, at times, what to say. I found myself trying to protect Clementine as much as I could. I realised her deepest desire was to see her parents, and I kept that in mind. I tried to save whoever I could. I saw people as humans, I saw them beneath their often capricious personalities (Kenny, Larry, Lilly - heh, even me sometimes). I tried to keep a level head all the time, and I guess that goes with my own underlying scepticism of life, held together by vocally agreeing with people who are good by their actions. I defined good as judging people not by what I or even our group needs, but by what the person being judged actually says they need. I could cite several situations, but I note this is a review, for those yet to buy the game.I'm glad, now looking at the game as a whole, that TellTale didn't do a 'Last of Us'. Not only is this game true to the comic book foundations of TWD, but it meant that more resources can go into making a fantastic decision-based story that feels so real and just draws you into it. Yes, you are not Lee Everett, you don't have his history, his family, or even his words (talking about the choices of dialogue you get), but it's close enough to identifying what kind of a person YOU are, because each dialogue option takes a certain philosophy and moral direction. Mostly, I was consistent, but sometimes, such as with Larry, I blew. I could talk a lot about what this game teaches you, or has taught me, but I must restrain myself, knowing not to let a review become an essay in philosophical thought.I haven't played anything like this before. It's different, and it's intelligent, and it will make you, yes, force you, to really think about what you say and do.			",35,10,0,2,1,0,0

Только для начала стоит уяснить,что это не шутер в котором небольшая группа людей истребляет половину населения зомбированого Китая,а - это душераздирающая история о жизни простых людей в тяжелые времена,в которой суровый бородатый геймер плачит громче девченки после просмотра любовного сериала.Игра - настолько интересная,что даже не играя,а бесконечно нажимаю Q,я получал множество эмоций и адреналина.Тем-более это единственная игра в своем роде на ПК,так что проходить мимо нее однозначно не стоит,Клементина ведь обидется ...Плюсы игры :░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░-Очень интересная история :-Множество необычных игровых моментов :-Колоритные персонажи :-Комиксовый визуальный стиль,который придает игре определенного шарму :-Свобода небольшого выбора :-Клементина собственной персоны .Минусы игры :░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░-Немного однообразный геймплей игры :-Иллюзия выбора.Тут два варианта: полюбить историю и персонажей или клеймить игру за геймплейный минимализм.Я смело выбираю 1 вариант и с нетерпением жду второй сезон !Моя оценка игре : 9,5 из 10.

												Хочешь отправится в опасное приключение по просторам зомби-апокалипсиса ? Тогда Добро пожаловать во вселенную игры The Walking Dead ! Только для начала стоит уяснить,что это не шутер в котором небольшая группа людей истребляет половину населения зомбированого Китая,а - это душераздирающая история о жизни простых людей в тяжелые времена,в которой суровый бородатый геймер плачит громче девченки после просмотра любовного сериала.Игра - настолько интересная,что даже не играя,а бесконечно нажимаю Q,я получал множество эмоций и адреналина.Тем-более это единственная игра в своем роде на ПК,так что проходить мимо нее однозначно не стоит,Клементина ведь обидется ...Плюсы игры :░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░-Очень интересная история :-Множество необычных игровых моментов :-Колоритные персонажи :-Комиксовый визуальный стиль,который придает игре определенного шарму :-Свобода небольшого выбора :-Клементина собственной персоны .Минусы игры :░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░-Немного однообразный геймплей игры :-Иллюзия выбора.Тут два варианта: полюбить историю и персонажей или клеймить игру за геймплейный минимализм.Я смело выбираю 1 вариант и с нетерпением жду второй сезон !Моя оценка игре : 9,5 из 10.

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- Pick up and play game which is relaxing and unique- Story strong with decision making genuinely shaping your game- Every decision you make as that little bar gets smaller, a desperate situation where you may kick yourself afterwards is very immersive. CONS:- A little buggy in areas, often talking whilst on screen falling behind, but nothing major as it doesnt take away from the immersionVERDICT? I cannot wait to play more Telltale games but after 5 episodes you can feel drained so they're not the types of games you can play in a row.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

The Walking DeadFirst of all, I would like to point out that many people have already written an excellent review about this game. However, after finishing this one I really felt the urge to let you know how I experienced this wonderful game.First ImpressionWell, as far as the first impression (~1 hour playtime) is concerned, I have to admit that I was delighted by the “cartoonish” texture and the “emotional depth”. I only expected and heard the best from “Telltale Games” but they somehow managed to surprise me.StorylineSo, now let´s talk about the story and the gameplay as such. Throughout the game you are playing as Lee, a convicted murderer. However, it might sound weird but I never felt any sort of hatred since the current problems (epidemic) are obviously far more important. As I already pointed out, you are Lee from now on and every following day might be your last one. The good thing though is that you aren´t alone. You are lucky enough to find Clementine, a girl aged 8 who lost her parents in Savannah. While Lee and Clementine stick together throughout the game some other “friends” you will make get lost or die, it´s all up to you. You don’t really have a final destination that’s why you are going to places where you expect to be safe.Choices“This games series adapts to the choices you make. The story is tailored by how you play.”As you might have already figured out that choices are fairly important in the first season of “The Walking Dead”, I would like to spend some time on figuring out whether choices modify your game completely. Well, I guess “Yes” and “No” is probably the most appropriate answer. You can pick one out of four different answers/reactions, which is of course and enormous variety. On the other side it doesn´t really change much. Let me explain myself with the following example: You have to choose what to do. Do you want to save a person XY our will you leave him/her behind? You have two totally different things you can choose from. But the story which follows afterwards will be the same for 100 per cent. You could argue that your decision you made is in some way really emotional and tragic but it doesn’t really change the gameplay. (I hope that was understandable since English isn´t my mother tongue. :/)GraphicsThe texture used is really unique. It´s just typical for all the “Telltale”- games. You can like it or hate it. (Well I guess that wasn´t really helpful but the graphic standards are really high nowadays which means it´s up to your choice. Look at some screenshots and you will know what I mean.)Mechanics (kept simple)Movement: WADSInteract: MouseChoose interaction: Mouse wheelPlaytimeNot only because of my lack of skill when it comes to Quicktime-Events (which occur regularly) but also some chapters I redid in order to figure out what would have happened if I had chosen something different it took me approximately 14.5 hours to finish this game.PriceI bought the game during the last Winter Sale but I think buying it for full price is also completely acceptable.Summary10/10A+Fantastic game for all type of gamers. I really recommend buying this game due to the emotional storyline and the wonderful graphics used.I hope my review was somewhat helpful. As I already pointed out, English is not my mother tongue so please keep that in mind. If you can give me any good advice: JUST DO IT.Mr.Visi0n ",57,6,0,2,3,0,11

												Emotional and well-paced point-and-click adventure game with an excellent story. It's so immersive and touching, you might actually forget you're playing a game and think you're watching an episode of a TV series. The comic-book graphic style suits the game perfectly. Rarely can a game make you feel so attached to the characters. Can't recommend it enough.			",166,79,0,31,4,2,25

												The Walking Dead has convinced me of the merits to episodic gaming. I found that the game stands by itself and that you don’t have to be a fan of the comics or the TV show to thoroughly enjoy this game. Although, it is really cool when you are a fan of the universe to get to interact with some of the characters that you know and love. The game allows for the player to make an abundance of choices that really do have an impact on how the game plays out. This leaves the player with the ability to go back and replay the game and have a completely different experience each time. This game has me hooked and I will definitely be playing the next installment.			",144,18,6,28,25,1,15

												One of the most enjoyable, unique and impressive games I've ever played. It's emotional, epic, involving, fun and so in-depth with regards to the characters and the revolutionised choice-based plot.The way Lee comes across entirely depends on you, as does the relationship with the people you are stuck with/chose to survive along with you. Very clever and heart-wrenching. The final scenes had me welling up and the last time I did that over a game was, like, 8 years ago.I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone. If you want a standard 'run around and shoot zombies using two brain-cells' game then don't expect that here, but do expect something different and a million times better. It just should be exerienced.			",69,62,0,9,0,0,0

												Cold, cruel, dark... how do I describe this game? No, this story? I just hope for one thing, and that is that no one has to ever experience the kind of emotional suffering involved for people in real life with real life decisions like choosing between lives to save or between your own welfare and your children's. No human should have to be forced to make those kinds of decisions. But that is exactly what this game forces you to do. Sure, you can stay silent during conversations, but you'll lose all respect.I played all five episodes, one each day, and I've just finished the last one. And I feel like I really don't want to play another Season. This game is not hard, it's brutal. I think about things like the apocalypse a lot, like what a world full of the living dead will be like, or a world where only you are alive. This game had me questioning, as I still do, the worth and value of human existence in times of prolonged suffering. Is there hope? Real hope? Or is that simply a mental mechanism to keep going and find a reason, however illogical, to keep living. What is the purpose of life, what are we living for? To raise up children, to just enjoy ourselves, to keep moving towards the inevitability of death? However unreal and farcical you may think a zombie apocalypse is, it acts as a compelling context for life questions.And not just that. It serves to seek out how we might react in a certain situation. Everyone has different personalities, and I'm sure you'd agree with me when I suggest that in this modern society, it's difficult to really know someone within a few days of meeting them. But when the world goes to absolute sh*t, there is no need for false impressions anymore. You can see people pretty square on. I had my brain in agony deciding, at times, what to say. I found myself trying to protect Clementine as much as I could. I realised her deepest desire was to see her parents, and I kept that in mind. I tried to save whoever I could. I saw people as humans, I saw them beneath their often capricious personalities (Kenny, Larry, Lilly - heh, even me sometimes). I tried to keep a level head all the time, and I guess that goes with my own underlying scepticism of life, held together by vocally agreeing with people who are good by their actions. I defined good as judging people not by what I or even our group needs, but by what the person being judged actually says they need. I could cite several situations, but I note this is a review, for those yet to buy the game.I'm glad, now looking at the game as a whole, that TellTale didn't do a 'Last of Us'. Not only is this game true to the comic book foundations of TWD, but it meant that more resources can go into making a fantastic decision-based story that feels so real and just draws you into it. Yes, you are not Lee Everett, you don't have his history, his family, or even his words (talking about the choices of dialogue you get), but it's close enough to identifying what kind of a person YOU are, because each dialogue option takes a certain philosophy and moral direction. Mostly, I was consistent, but sometimes, such as with Larry, I blew. I could talk a lot about what this game teaches you, or has taught me, but I must restrain myself, knowing not to let a review become an essay in philosophical thought.I haven't played anything like this before. It's different, and it's intelligent, and it will make you, yes, force you, to really think about what you say and do.			",35,10,0,2,1,0,0

												I can't say it enough. GET A PROJECTOR!! It will change your gaming life!!!! This game was nice, BUT, it was so much better on my wall! Games like this one, Jurassic Park & The Wolf Among Us, with huge storylines and limited interaction possibilities would be better enjoyed with the picture as great as you can make it! Yes I have imported my decisions into season 2 (mass effect), I played the DLC, & am excited to hear of further upcoming seasons. The main protagonist, an african-american man, is a romantic, and easy to like, although he won't (can't) continue beyond this season. I am still getting used to the idea of playing a little girl (Clementine) in season 2. As a story, and played through the projector on my wall, I liked this game, HINTING that without doing that my enjoyment as much as I did now may have been reduced by HALF! So yes that big-picture made a difference! Nice.			",906,268,12,52,34,7,57

												This is the first Telltale game I have ever played, and it definitely was not what I expected.  Given their previous games and despite the subject matter, I was not expecting such a dark game but they pulled it off very well.  I can't think of any other game I have played that gives the player such difficult decisions to make and they do have a significant impact on the story later on.  The storytelling and voice acting is fantastic, as I would expect.Graphically, the game really isn't great.  It is styled to look like the comics, but many of the textures are absurdly low resolution for a modern game which hurts the visible detail.  It's passable though and not really the focus of the game.The gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag for me.  While I do like the innovative way they deal with many ""struggle"" events with a cursor that appears in a random place, the ""mash button to do something"" sections have been done to death in this and other games, and was never immersive, interesting, or good for your keyboard/gamepad.  I really hope season 2 isn't full of that as well.I am definitely looking forward to playing other Telltale games and I have a few on my list, if mostly for the storytelling.  Now back to dealing with zombies in season 2.			",862,202,24,72,69,9,114

												Playing for the second time, this game always gets me. It's full of surprises, thrills, feels, everything mixed up. It's a wonderful story, wonderful gameplay, game is truly a masterpiece in every way. I already beat it once, but since TWD Season 2 came out, I wanted to play this game once again, just to feel like it how it is to play as a Lee. I think that no other game will make you as sad/happy as this one. It has it's moments where the tension rises to the maximum, where you actually feel somekind of bond between characters, especially bond between you ( main character ) and Clementine.I can't say anything other than you should try this game for yourself. It's quite unique experience, worth every single penny. 10/10			",302,76,6,22,14,1,29

												I highly recommend this game. The Walking Dead is all about storyline and Characterisation. Much like in Comics and TV-series it builds strongly into emotion and depression of this Zombie-Apocalyptic world and in this game you can make choices. Depending on your choices - you can make people like you or hate you. There are a lot of tough decissions to make. When I first heard about this title I didn't even know what The Walking Dead was when my friend told me to play it but this game totally surprised me in what it does emotionally and also it got to me in TV-series.. I think it's a really best interactive story-telling game and a game that everyone should play ;)			",462,98,12,72,34,4,44

												Originally released as five episodes starting in April and ending in November 2012, The Walking Dead: The Game casts us as Lee Everett, a convicted murderer on his way to the big house. However, before Mr. Everett can trade his denim shirt for an orange jumpsuit, the zombie apocalypse breaks out and gives Lee new goals in life: namely, surviving at all costs and protecting a little girl named Clementine.It is these two goals that make The Walking Dead: The Game the juggernaut that it is. See, The Walking Dead is an adventure game, but it’s not the kind of adventure game you’ve come to expect. Sure, you’ll need to figure out how to get a radio working and how to distract walkers here and there, but the real draw here is a “choose your own adventure.”As you play through the five episodes, the big moments come when you choose how Lee responds to situations and what he says in conversations with his fellow survivors. Choices and dialogue pop up on screen with timers, and you have seconds to pick exactly what you’re going to do or say. Whereas previous adventure games from developer Telltale Games would let you run through every possible line of dialogue, that isn’t the case here. In The Walking Dead, you choose, and the game moves on – adapting its story to each decision.This is what makes The Walking Dead so special. You and I are tasked with the same goal of protecting Clem, but the way we do it might be completely different. I might choose to befriend someone you hate, and you might choose to leave someone I took. I might shoot my mouth off in anger, but you might keep your cool; either way, the group will remember that and the dynamic will change. The decisions you’re making in the moment have ripples that go throughout the entire adventure. When you get to Episode 5, the things you have and haven’t done – the choices you haven’t thought about since Episode 1 – are going to come up.Will our endings be completely different? No. The Walking Dead: The Game is telling us the same story and thus taking us to the same conclusion, but it allows us to experience it in different ways. I’ve heard some naysayers refer to this as “the illusion of choice” -- as in what we’re doing or saying really doesn’t matter because it all nets out relatively the same -- but that’s selling the journey short. The Walking Dead: The Game is like a coloring book: we each have the same black and white sketch, but it’s up to us to fill it in as we see fit. The relationships I’ve built, the emotions I’ve felt, the choices I’ve made – that’s what makes The Walking Dead: The Game so endearing.Part of that connection comes from excellent writing from the Telltale staff that manages to be funny, tense and scary at the right moments, amazing voice acting from Lee and Clementine, and a visual style that’s pulled from the comic book world the game is set in and that never manages to get boring. There’s this perfect storm here that manages to create such believable characters and set us in their world.When it comes to actually playing The Walking Dead: The Game, Telltale whipped up a new adventure control scheme. Like I said, for choices, text pops up and you have to jump on it, but for controlling Lee, one stick controls the character and the other controls an onscreen reticle you can use to interact with objects and people. When the action gets going and you need to shoot zombies or fight off walkers, it can be jarring to use the reticle stick to line up shots, but that’s part of the fun – the game catches you off guard with things and you have to scramble to the foreign control in order to survive.What holds The Walking Dead: The Game back from being a masterpiece are technical hiccups that have been well documented throughout the episodic adventure and are common Telltale stumbles. Scenes freeze as the next one loads, gameplay slows down as the game tries to process intense action, and save files inexplicably disappear. These are disappointing, but in the end, experiencing The Walking Dead: The Game is well worth any technical blemish you might have to sit through.While we have not encountered these problems, some owners of the Xbox 360 disc version of the game and Xbox 360 units without hard drives have reported stutter/playback issues. For information on how to fix that, see Telltale's support page.			",142,25,2,9,6,0,6

It's a point and click puzzle game that also involves making decisions although those decisions don't matter at all.+ Characters who feel and act real and that you actually care about+ Only takes itself seriously when it needs to+ Art style that stays true to the comics- Not enough gameplay.- Animations make me think all the characters in the game are robots- Too many quicktime events- Decisions make no actual difference in the storyOnly buy it if you know and are okay with exactly what you're getting into.

												A gripping tale of love, loss, and a whole lotta zombies, Telltale's The Walking Dead is a ride you don't want to miss. There are some questionable choices made, and certain story beats feel a little less fleshed-out than they could be (no pun intended), but overall I think TWD is an experience everyone should get the chance to play through for themselves. The art is exceptional, with a pretty unique style, and the sound is decent-to-great, but the main two pillars of this game are story and gameplay, and both are handled beautifully.The gameplay itself is a mix of quick-time events (which actually are pretty fun and usually exciting, and include some interesting variations on the norm), puzzle solving, and dialogue/story choices, and it plays out really well, drawing you into the story and letting you explore to find out more.The story is why you'll really be playing this, though, and it doesn't disappoint; it's a knockout. It starts fast and hard and only lets up to lead to the next big event, much like a good rollercoaster. Towards the end of the game, I felt that the locations stopped varying as much, but that's a small flaw in a bigger picture of neat locales and scenarios. The story beats range from sad, to interesting, to downright horrifying, but they're the most interesting when they're completely surprising. That's one thing: Some twists, for me at any rate, were easy to spot coming, but that didn't ruin my enjoyment of them. I really cared about these characters as I spent more and more time with them, and the way the story handles dark and grim themes draws you into the world and never lets you go.I'd hesitate to call it my game of the year 2012, but it's up there. Beautifully done, kudos to Telltale, and with a sequel slated for release later this year, there's never been a better time to experience The Walking Dead for yourself.9.5/10			",475,90,5,45,26,6,34

												To begin, I don't play point & click style games, just not my thing, however... Being a fan of the walking dead, I've debated getting this for ages, and seeing it in a bundle, I finally gave in and got it. The gameplay itself isn't really exciting, the controls felt weird to me in a few situations, and the choices I made in the game felt really minor for the most part. As far as I can tell, my choices simply alter the relationships between the characters, with no significant impact on the stories outcome. That being said though, the story for this was truly amazing, and that's more then enough. If I were to sum up this game in a single sentence it would be...This is a must watch interactive movie for any TWD fan.			",164,16,3,17,15,2,10

												This was my introduction to the Episodic TV-show-like point-and-click genre and I was not disappointed.This is not a game in the traditional sense but more like an interactive TV show where you help the onscreen characters navigate a hopeless world. Pros Fantastic Compelling StoryTough DecisionsGreat CharactersGood ActingTime-limited decisions Cons Some weird camera mumbo jumboSome weird level design that has me looking in completely the wrong place for 10 minutes hitting the same 3 objects in a row. This gets really annoying when I know exactly what has to be done but the game won't let me because I have to do some weird superfluous action first due to weird level design. Overall This was a great introduction to a genre I didn't think I would like. Make sure you play with a gamepad as this game is best played on the couch with friends. If you haven't played any games in this genre yet I would recommend Life Is Strange first as that plays a little more like a traditional video game and is also better. This was a fun play-through though and is highly recommended.			",131,20,0,38,37,0,49

												I can't say it enough. GET A PROJECTOR!! It will change your gaming life!!!! This game was nice, BUT, it was so much better on my wall! Games like this one, Jurassic Park & The Wolf Among Us, with huge storylines and limited interaction possibilities would be better enjoyed with the picture as great as you can make it! Yes I have imported my decisions into season 2 (mass effect), I played the DLC, & am excited to hear of further upcoming seasons. The main protagonist, an african-american man, is a romantic, and easy to like, although he won't (can't) continue beyond this season. I am still getting used to the idea of playing a little girl (Clementine) in season 2. As a story, and played through the projector on my wall, I liked this game, HINTING that without doing that my enjoyment as much as I did now may have been reduced by HALF! So yes that big-picture made a difference! Nice.			",906,268,12,52,34,7,57

												One of the most enjoyable, unique and impressive games I've ever played. It's emotional, epic, involving, fun and so in-depth with regards to the characters and the revolutionised choice-based plot.The way Lee comes across entirely depends on you, as does the relationship with the people you are stuck with/chose to survive along with you. Very clever and heart-wrenching. The final scenes had me welling up and the last time I did that over a game was, like, 8 years ago.I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone. If you want a standard 'run around and shoot zombies using two brain-cells' game then don't expect that here, but do expect something different and a million times better. It just should be exerienced.			",69,62,0,9,0,0,0

												Playing for the second time, this game always gets me. It's full of surprises, thrills, feels, everything mixed up. It's a wonderful story, wonderful gameplay, game is truly a masterpiece in every way. I already beat it once, but since TWD Season 2 came out, I wanted to play this game once again, just to feel like it how it is to play as a Lee. I think that no other game will make you as sad/happy as this one. It has it's moments where the tension rises to the maximum, where you actually feel somekind of bond between characters, especially bond between you ( main character ) and Clementine.I can't say anything other than you should try this game for yourself. It's quite unique experience, worth every single penny. 10/10			",302,76,6,22,14,1,29

												This is the first Telltale game I have ever played, and it definitely was not what I expected.  Given their previous games and despite the subject matter, I was not expecting such a dark game but they pulled it off very well.  I can't think of any other game I have played that gives the player such difficult decisions to make and they do have a significant impact on the story later on.  The storytelling and voice acting is fantastic, as I would expect.Graphically, the game really isn't great.  It is styled to look like the comics, but many of the textures are absurdly low resolution for a modern game which hurts the visible detail.  It's passable though and not really the focus of the game.The gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag for me.  While I do like the innovative way they deal with many ""struggle"" events with a cursor that appears in a random place, the ""mash button to do something"" sections have been done to death in this and other games, and was never immersive, interesting, or good for your keyboard/gamepad.  I really hope season 2 isn't full of that as well.I am definitely looking forward to playing other Telltale games and I have a few on my list, if mostly for the storytelling.  Now back to dealing with zombies in season 2.			",862,202,24,72,69,9,114

												Unbelievably believable, totally dramatic, and absolutely fantastic adventure that reveals the significance of emotional narrative for video games.Setting a new level of empathy with virtual characters, it's something more than just another interactive movie - and it's definitely more than any other generic story game could offer. It is probably the best game of the year, so don't miss it. Just don't.And yep, Telltale, you have my heart again.			",764,309,27,80,64,6,93

												To begin, I don't play point & click style games, just not my thing, however... Being a fan of the walking dead, I've debated getting this for ages, and seeing it in a bundle, I finally gave in and got it. The gameplay itself isn't really exciting, the controls felt weird to me in a few situations, and the choices I made in the game felt really minor for the most part. As far as I can tell, my choices simply alter the relationships between the characters, with no significant impact on the stories outcome. That being said though, the story for this was truly amazing, and that's more then enough. If I were to sum up this game in a single sentence it would be...This is a must watch interactive movie for any TWD fan.			",164,16,3,17,15,2,10

												It's a great game to play through once, the story is good and even though you can't really influence where the story goes you can influence the characters in the story and what happens to certain ones and how they act. It's fun for a playthrough and while there's some replayability in seeing what happens if you do something different there's not enough to warrant multiple playthroughs, it is a fun experience though.

												""First of the year"" review! I wish everyone who reads this a nice and joyful 2017! Let´s start right into with something good, just like a positive review for an awesome game!What should I even start with? The Walking Dead is simply one of those games you can´t dislike. You just can´t.As you might have expected, I am a HUGE friend of story based games and this one is definately one of the best you can find among those. I enjoyed my time with it, more than with a lot of other games. As soon as I will have finished Season Two, I will probably complete the entire first season again, so that I can make different choices. I am sure every playthrough is an entire new experience. Despite the comic graphics, the gore is intense. Unlike many other Zombie games, there are no cutscenes and you are always focused on the events. Telltale tried to keep the comic style from their inspirators, but they created graphics so realistic that it´s frightening. Don´t expect from this beeing your average Zombie game. It´s not a shooter. Not at all. Unfortunately the gameplay is as boring as empty space, you wander arround, click on dots, search the screen for items and defend yourself by instantly pressing ""Q"", as this is the only thing necessary to pass the quick time events. In most cases you don´t even have to shoot Zombies, no, walkers, but instead run away, by holding ""W""-key... There isn´t real music, except for the credits song, but all other sounds are great. Also the voice acting is fantastic, all roles are synchronized trustworthy, suitably pronounced and emotionally, at the right moments. English is the only audio language, so you should master it, but the subtitles are available in some other languages and the translation is allright, the few mistakes don´t matter.Storywise this is fantastic, the storylines make the game. I don´t want to spoil you any parts, but I promise you, you will like it. This game will stay in your mind for a long time. If you love stories, you must play this on your own. Don´t watch it anywhere, take part in it. The only thing that disturbs me are the achievements, of which only two require specific handling. All other are gained throughout progress. That´s a nice thing for achievement hunters, but I think such a game should either have achievments which require some effort or none. But ""no effort achievements"", as I use to call them, are in fact annother Telltale-feature, so we should get used to it.22,99$ is quite a lot of money, but they will reward you with 13+ hours of the best of intense, interactive, emotional and memorable stories in the history of video gaming. I wish everyone will think about this and not about the weak gameplay The Walking Dead has. With that said I want to thank you for reading, I´d like to ask you for a rating or a comment on how to improve my review and I hope all of you will have a nice year 2017; hopefully WITH playing The Walking Dead.

												There's not much gameplay to speak of, even for a point and click game. Compared to others in the genre there is very little in the way of puzzle solving, instead being replaced with exploration and character dialog. In a sense, it's probably the closest thing you can get to a fully interactive movie and it's a damn good one too!As you try to stay alive after the zombie apocalypse, you are forced to make some tough choices, usually having a huge impact on the characters around you who, through some really fantastic writing, you really come to know, get opinions on and even appreciate.If you're looking for a game that will push and pull your emotions in all directions, and is also both highly polished in audio and video, look no further.

As soon as I will have finished Season Two, I will probably complete the entire first season again, so that I can make different choices. I am sure every playthrough is an entire new experience. Despite the comic graphics, the gore is intense. Unlike many other Zombie games, there are no cutscenes and you are always focused on the events. Telltale tried to keep the comic style from their inspirators, but they created graphics so realistic that it´s frightening. Don´t expect from this beeing your average Zombie game. It´s not a shooter. Not at all. Unfortunately the gameplay is as boring as empty space, you wander arround, click on dots, search the screen for items and defend yourself by instantly pressing ""Q"", as this is the only thing necessary to pass the quick time events. In most cases you don´t even have to shoot Zombies, no, walkers, but instead run away, by holding ""W""-key... There isn´t real music, except for the credits song, but all other sounds are great. Also the voice acting is fantastic, all roles are synchronized trustworthy, suitably pronounced and emotionally, at the right moments. English is the only audio language, so you should master it, but the subtitles are available in some other languages and the translation is allright, the few mistakes don´t matter.Storywise this is fantastic, the storylines make the game. I don´t want to spoil you any parts, but I promise you, you will like it. This game will stay in your mind for a long time. If you love stories, you must play this on your own. Don´t watch it anywhere, take part in it. The only thing that disturbs me are the achievements, of which only two require specific handling. All other are gained throughout progress. That´s a nice thing for achievement hunters, but I think such a game should either have achievments which require some effort or none. But ""no effort achievements"", as I use to call them, are in fact annother Telltale-feature, so we should get used to it.22,99$ is quite a lot of money, but they will reward you with 13+ hours of the best of intense, interactive, emotional and memorable stories in the history of video gaming. I wish everyone will think about this and not about the weak gameplay The Walking Dead has. With that said I want to thank you for reading, I´d like to ask you for a rating or a comment on how to improve my review and I hope all of you will have a nice year 2017; hopefully WITH playing The Walking Dead.

												Clementine is the best video game character ever. I honestly never got into point and click games that much and probably never would have even played this had it not been for getting Episodes 1 & 2 as part of Playstation+ one month. So glad I did. This is one of the best story games I have played in a long time. Great characters and tons of tension. A great emotional journey, and to me this game is better han the TV show. I care more about the characters here than I do on th show by miles.			",554,280,18,56,35,8,38

												The Hachiko movie is a comedy in contrast with this game. I cried like a daddy's girl when I finished the last chapter. If you like Kirkman's TWD comic as I do then you'll love the game as well. It brings you into a dark deep atmosphere of postapocalyptic world, you'll follow characters stories and will make choices of their desteny. TWD game is the best game of such genre and it's how I see the perfect game that is related to the main comic series.10/10			",248,76,8,35,36,0,31

												The plot was unnecessarily too slow at times and that “you are not pressing the button fast enough” fake difficulty was annoying from time to time, but over all I enjoyed this title very much. The problem with this game became apparent when already at the DLC levels I restarted the game just to find that my saves are missing. After some googling I found out that this happened to quite a few people already and that TTG had no solution for it. Taking into account I played this way after  the release date I would expect such huge problems to be patched already.I would not recommend any game that messes up basic functionality such as saves, but for a game that is an interactive story that builds on your choices this is even bigger no no!Well at least this saved me some money as I'm not getting furtherer seasons :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Walking Dead made by Telltale is trully a masterful piece of work. Telltale Studios overdid themselves by making great lovable characters, an impressive art style (which is very rare nowadays with all the mainstream games) and a story which will leave you speechless. To put it short, everyone who loves ""The Walking Dead"" universe should definitely buy this game and play it thoroughly, hell, even people who don't have a clue about this should at least try it, it will change your opinion on games forever.

												The walking dead is a true adventure game. It is based off of the point and click mechanics of adventure games, but you do have some movement and control on your character. These mechanics work well, but they are not the highlight of the game. The highlight of the game is the story, characters, and the choices you will make throughout the game. Every choice you make determines how other characters react to you and whether they will help you or not in certain situations. The mechanic works exceptionally well, although, sometimes the story still feels kind of linear. The last episode would be the most disappointing in how your choices all merge into the same ending sadly. I know it is extremely disappointing when this happens, but I cannot complain since it is a small development studio and when pressed for time and resources, you can only do so much. I still highly recommend the game since it literally feels like another walking dead season! Pick it up and enjoy the amazing story!			",340,27,2,69,25,1,68

												Relationships forged and broken while struggling to overcome all odds of the damned world that they know now, Telltale Games has certainly grasped its audience with its unique take of The Walking Dead series and added elements of sorrow and grief of each and every charracter's struggle of survival. Though the passing of it all may be sluggish at times, no doubt it's story will definitely be enjoyed and emphatised as they move on each step forward of the events occuring.

												Waiting for season two with bated breath. What more can I say?OK I guess I can say the cameos are awesome, the storyline is engaging and you really grow to like the characters. When something bad happens, it frustrates you because you care about these people. I found I was enjoying myself far more than I did while watching the show, and I quite like the show. If you ask me, that's high praise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Walking Dead is a game that is is for people that prefers the story to hitting things with fancy looking sticks. The game claims (and is not wrong in doing so) that the decisions that you make affects the story further down the line. These decisions can range from how to respond to what someone says to being given a situation where you have a good reason to kill someone and deciding if you want to do it. The choices you make will decide how people respect you and how willing they are to help you or listen to what you say.The Walking Dead is based off a comic book series of the same name, but you don't need to have seen it to understand the story  as you play as someone at the onset of the zombie situation who is having to learn how everything works anyway. You play as a guy called Lee who has conveniently commited murder just in time for a horde of zombies to eat the policeman driving him to jail. You meet a girl called Clementine and you two go off on wacky adventures to stay alive amidst a zombie apocalypse. You meet a variety of people and form relationships as you go off to find a more permanent place to hang out.The whole decision making mechanic is rather fun, however there are times where I choose something to say, but Lee says it in a different way than what I was expecting. For example, during a group discussion, Clementine wanted to go to the toilet and I said ""Then just go"", but I didn't expect him to be angry at her when saying it. This doesn't happen too much, but it doesn't help with immersion. I also like that the game doesn't focus on zombie killing, but rather on regular people actually trying to survive the zombie apocolype, involving rationing food and trying to find supplies in abandoned buildings.The Walking Dead doesn't go for realism in terms of graphics, but chooses to instead go for a comic book style of detail. This is probably good for this game as it could detract from the storytelling.I would not recommend it to someone wanting to just fight zombies or for a game with good graphics, but I would highly recommend it for someone who wants to play a game for the story it tells. If that is your preference, then this is worth playing.			",80,86,0,3,13,1,12

It is a story driven game whereby your choices affects the later parts of the game. Its sort of like those old school game books, where you have to make choices and then flip to a particular page. The characters and choices makes you feel connected to the story. Controls works smoothly havent experience any problems from the game. Love the artworks too. Any fans from the walking dead series will definitely enjoy this! Im looking forward to getting my hands on season two. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasnt play it yet.

												Probably my all time favourite adventure game - despite its current, incomplete release. The Walking Dead thrives on its excellent storytelling and character-based narratives, which together, conveys a more realistic and believeable zombie-apocalypse world than any other Z-related fps. Each player experiences a unique playthrough, driven by complex, moral decisions that has different consequences, and will ultimately, influence their outcome of the story. This is by far, one of the most interactive games that allows a player's own personality to impact on their experience. It is in their interest to explore each chapter carefully, collecting clues / information about other characters / situations before making a decision. A masterful addition to the already superb repertoire of Telltale adventure games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a must have.  Very good story, great characters (both main and side). A big part of it is the choices/actions feel real and really make you think ""what would I do?"". What really makes it stand out are the hard, hard choices you have to make and fast.  This adds to weight of your decisions and can sometimes come back to bite you (no pun intended).  On top of that this games finds just the right way to pull at your emotions adding even more to the outcomes of some decisions.I'm never really been one for ""Point & Click Adventure"" games but this one was a lot fun.  Also the art style reminds me a lot of Borderlands in the way it looks.  Another thing about this game is how they really tired to make the characters seem like real people who make mistakes and have faults.

												One of the best games I have played. Telltale Games really does a good job at connecting you to the characters. Great story for 10+ hours of gameplay and an awesome DLC. Anyone who says this game sucks is lying. Just stayin			",24,4,1,1,3,0,1

												I'll admit this was the first TellTale game I played and I was not disappointed! I was skeptical about a unique Walking Dead story, but playing the first episode washed away my fears. That Clementine though... not many games make me shed man tears.			",705,182,11,97,45,8,95

												An incredibly fascinating experience which cannot be praised enough.It gave me more shivers than most films I've watched as I grew extremely attached to some of the characters.Due to the joy I got out of this and ""The Wolf Among Us"", I'm probably going to pre-order every TellTale-game in the future.

												Fans of The Walking dead will love this game. I remember waiting for each new episode with excitement, but the game does have some cons.The Pros:1.  An immersive story2.  The game makes you question your decisions and face the consequences3.  The game makes you feel for the characters4.  Each episode is better than the previous The Cons:1. Some feel the conclusion of the game is a slap to the face because the outcome is largely not in the hands of the player. (I feel the ending was perfect)2. The first episode is not the best. It does give a treat for the comic readers though. The episode is riddled with cheap jumps cares, low quality audio for a character, and a few minor graphical errors.3. The 400 days DLC feels on par with the first episode. It features 5 minor stories and how they converge. There is a tie-in with Season 2 that is mediocre so far and it does not look like it is going anywhere.I would give this game an 8.5/10 ",196,32,6,22,12,1,29

												♥♥♥♥ing. Amazing.Alright, so to lay it out for you...On the company and their style:  A lot of people have been giving Telltale flack after how Jurassic Park was so heavily Quick-Time-Event oriented.  Understandably so.  Let me start off by clearing this up - This game is NOT QTE ORIENTED!  At all!  The closest it has is a few moments when you need to make a decision under pressure - if you don't decide fast enough it just makes something else happen.  Very neat aspect!On the Walking Dead IP and it's use here:   This is NOT based off the Television show.  That has NOTHING to do with this game.  This is set in the COMIC world with COMIC art style.   HOWEVER, it's a story that hasn't been told - focused on a character that we never knew.   That said, there are cameos and locations from the comics that are amazing to see as an avid reader.The game itself:   ♥♥♥♥ing. Awesome. Zombie. Game.  5/5.			",164,21,0,36,34,1,38

												The Walking Dead, as said by wikis and such, is supposed to be based on both the comic book series and the TV show. Being a fan of both, I really appreciate this games atmosphere and plotline. It an emotional rollercoaster with the occasional jumpscare here and there. The graphics are not much to ponder on considering its a classic 'Telltale Games' type. The story is well-crafted and not what youd quite think would turn out. As an addition to the game, the 400 Days DLC was also a nice little sidestory or introduction to these excess characters. I look forward to Season 2 of the game and happily await the TV series return as well.			",93,15,1,12,6,3,12

And I LOVE IT!It's got one of the most engaging and interactive stories in video games. Your choices really do matter and will affect the outcome of the story in many ways.It features one of the most well written and realized child characters in videogames, movies and TV combined. Finally a child character who isn't either completely useless or the most annoying person in the gameCurrently replaying it to get my decisions right for when Season 2 comes out real soon!

												The Walking Dead will take you through the real angst of a zombie apocalypse. No cool guns, no Rambos, just you trying to survive and protect those you love in the middle of hell on Earth. And thing can, and will, go badly.Based on the comic, this game doesn't bear share the same storyline the TV series does. As for the gameplay, there isn't much more than a few easy puzzles, action events and clicks, similar to Heavy Rain with less trivialities. Graphics aren't that poolished either. Music and sound FX fit well but aren't particularly outstanding. The strong point is the story, that's very well narrated and will have you immersed the whole 12-14 hours the game lasts, peaking during the ending.If you like zombie games and a good story, don't doubt this game is for you, 8,2/10			",141,29,1,7,10,3,12

												The Walking Dead is kind of like one of those choose your own adventure books. Even though the story is quite linear, you must follow the path provided, the choices you make (via conversations) elicit different outcomes, so no two playthroughs are exactly alike.It isn't exactly challenging in terms of combat but that's not the point of this game. This game is just like being in the comic but you get to make the choices.The graphics rock.Soundtrack and ambient audio is awesome.Story and script are awesome, and 'realistic'.Had no glitches at all (which is rare).Really well fleshed out characters (but they shuld be, they've been in the comic for long enough)Bonuses: Problem solving in a hurry - yes, please!

												The first time I played this game I didn't know what to expect. I initially assumed it was simply a horror game and went in completely blind, since even now I haven't watched the TV series.But don't let the fact that you haven't watched the show dissuade you from playing this game! I don't know if they link up to each other or not, but the game is totally playable to newbies of the franchise.The way the game plays out is that you constantly meet new characters with different situations playing out, in which you must choose an option or response to further the story.Although there are finite possibilities (obviously), you feel drawn in by these characters and situations in such a way, that you want to choose the best responses to each situation possible, to either help or hinder others.You are part of the story, and with stats at the end showing how you reacted vs others. It makes for some interesting hindsight.These actions you perform form a bigger picture in how things will progress later on down the line, some choices are more important than others, but they lead so far that they go into the second game.With the second game fully accessible to everyone now, this is as good a time as any to try this franchise, and see for yourself why it is a must-buy! Would definately recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy a game for it's story, then this one if for you. In ""The Walking Dead"", pretty much all you do is click to choose which out of three or four lines to say. It's a pretty calm game in terms of interaction; more like the game you'd play when you just woke up and aren't exactly ready for a more intense FPS. I think it's decent and I'd suggest it for the story line. It pulls you in and really makes you want to find out what happens.			",8,1,0,3,1,0,3

												If you want a game where you make choices that impact the narrative in a way beyond ""you get +5 blue points and -5 red points and now you can use blue dialogue options"", then you want The Walking Dead. Don't get me wrong- the major story milestones are set in stone.  But everything around them can change pretty dramatically, in terms of character behaviors, interactions, and some very impactful decisions.  You'll hit the big moments everyone else hits, but the whole journey will be unique to you and your decisions.The Walking Dead is an important game for the future of interactive narratives in mainstream titles, and you should play it.

												A pensive thumbs up, because it isn't my cup of tea when it comes to games. The Walking Dead is a story telling game, and for a story telling game it's top notch. The writing is solid and the voice acting is top notch. There is a lot to explore and plenty of things you will want to mouse over. Lee and Clementine are a great pair and you start caring for them early.That being said, the game moves slowly and requires you to be a methodical inspector of the environment. Not good for someone who likes to run around a map shooting anything that moves.  I was quickly getting bored and finding ways to get the zombies to attack and found that even the defending yourself to be..meh. This is more about my personal game preference more than failure in design. You just have to know what sort of game you like.			",28,6,0,0,1,0,0

												11/10.My first point and click type of game, and my first Telltale game aswell. I have zero regrets and cannot wait to play Season Two. I dont watch the tv show but I've read a lot of the comics, those are pretty sweet! This game tries to follow a similar art style to the comics, it looks great and it runs great even on a laptop (a8 apu). I played this on a big screen with a controller, some parts I feel would have been easier with a mouse. The script writting is beyond great and the decision based mechanics are incredible but you gotta think quick!, Im really liking this type of genre where you can decide outcomes. Every episode left me wanting more. Pros+Very immeraive storyline+Unique art style+Variety of gameplay mechanism+Zombies+Runs greatCons-Emotional Rollercoaster-Gets you right in the feels.

												After playing through this season twice (once on 360, once on Steam), I can definitely say without a doubt in my mind that this is one of the best, most emotionally compelling story-based games out there. If you want a ride of emotions, buy this game. The gameplay is sparse, but that's not what the game is about. The actual gameplay is based on you (Lee) making decisions that affect you and your whole party, leading to friends, enemies, conflict, and lots of death. Overall, the first playthrough is about 8 hours long and every playthrough afterwards is about 6 hours since you know what you want to do. If you haven't played this game and love a good story, buy it now, or wait for a sale. It typically goes for 75% off and it is more than worth it at that discount. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			",114,21,6,23,18,0,13

												OK this game has 20000 reviews so I'll be short. As an adventure game amateur I was really blown away by the great atmosphere, the expressive characters , and the difficult choices this game give you, as well as the alternative endings. The story is really intense, even at times unrealisticly so, but mostly it's well orchestrated, there is a great story in this game.The story and genereal atmosphere and graphic is so great in fact that it might blind you to the flaws of the game. The gameplay in itself is really minimalistic, it's there but compared to the storytelling part of the game, it kind of feels anemic. The puzzles are very simple and\or obvious , and it feels like the designers didn't want anything to go in the way of the story. The quick time events with the weird q button are more annoying than scary, I have gone through the game but I still haven't figured out how it works. I kind of liked the action sequences involving fighting and guns but this was rather primitive as well.  Still it's obvious for me that a ""the walking dead"" serie is the future of adventure gaming, with atmospheric graphics, deep characters and convoluted storylines. However gameplay must be a part of it to really hit the spot, with real puzzles to solve.As it stand The Walking Dead is dangerously close to be an interactive story with different endings, nothing wrong with this kind of games especially when it's well done like this one, but I really think it could be more with some added gameplay especially in the puzzle section. With a little luck Telltales will deliver something like that soon, and we might just experience a new golden age in the adventure game scene...			",192,88,1,44,13,0,24

												A story driven point and click adventure game and for sure, is one of the best Point and click adventure games ever made (with monkey island ofc). The story of Lee and Clementine is truly amasing and the choices you have made, really make a diffrence. Even Thou it has some techincall issues like techincall hiccups, but they're not game breaking. Overall this game is worth your time it gets a 9/10 from me.			",64,6,0,1,4,1,5

												This is a great game. It has a very compelling story, and you will most likely become at least a little attached to the characters. It's very fun to be able to treat certain characters how you want to. If you're looking for replay value, you can play through the game again, making different decisions, but there isn't much replay value after that. This is of course because you already know what's going to happen no matter what you do.I recommend to pick this up, although since you're probably only going to play it 2 or 3 times, your best bet is to buy it on sale.

												The story line is driven by what choices you make as the character, Lee, who is trying to survive and keep a little kid safe.There's plenty of tough choices to make that alter the outcomes to a scenario and what other characters feel and think about you. Not alot of killing involved, not as much as the TV show but mostly about making some hard decisions that you might feel are wrong but you gotta do it to survive.Good graphics 4/5Interesting story 5/5400 Days DLC 1/5 - Too short.

Very good game.The storyline is amazing and is written by the choices you take, truly worth the money spent.Storyline: 9.5/10The storyline is amazing, filled with plot twists and new things is revealed all the time. Not too much to say here.Graphics: 9/10The graphics has a comic feel to it, just like the comic that this game is based on. It doesn't feel weird at all as you might think, it fits right in. The only thing that i feel they could do better, was the effects.Gameplay: 8.5/10As i stated in the start of this review, the story is tailored by the choices you take in the game. However, sometimes the story might evolve in another way than what you chose/thought of it to go. This, together with the fact that sometimes it might be a little tricky to find out what to do, drags down my rating a bit. The animations however, feel just like they should together with the comic style graphics.Sounds/Music: 10/10The soundtrack for the game is amazing, sounds just like it should and doesn't feel repetitive throughout the game. The music combined with the neatly done voice acting and sound effects, makes the game a joy for the ears.Overall rating: 9/10The game in general is amazing and definently worth the money. However, as stated in this review i feel there is some things they could've made better. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes a good story.			",37,3,1,2,0,0,0

												Honestly, I didn't know what to expect from this game. Most of the time, I try to refrain from playing games based on movies or television shows, but this creation stems from a comic book series. I think we can all agree that the best games are usually based off of comic books!I was surprised at how much I enjoyed playing this game. Your decisions directly affect your relationships in the game (not so much the story progression). I really appreciate a game that isn't 100% based on combat, but is more focused on the story itself. Those are the games that stick with you, those are the games that are really beautiful. This story was so captivating - I had to play the whole thing through. In the end, I cried my heart out... I was so overwhelmed with emotion.I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone (and don't worry, the zombies aren't THAT scary!).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Story The story of The Walking Dead is the strong point of the entire game. You play as Lee Everett, a convicted criminal who gets a second chance at life thanks to a zombie apocolypse. While fleeing, he comes across a young girl named Clementine, whom he vows to protect. Throughout the story, Lee comes across a variety of characters, some of which want to help him, while others want him dead. It's up to you, the player, to decide how to handle these situations while the threat of zombies looms at all times. The plot of the game is it's selling point. Perhaps one of the most emotionally involved story in gaming to date, The Walking Dead makes you feel apart of the world by allowing you to play the role of Lee through voice dialogues and decisions. The game promotes the fact that every decision you make or every answer you give will have some impact in the story. Although this may not be true at all times, the story is still quite incredible. Play the game for this reason alone. Gameplay The gameplay of this game may seem very boring to some. The game mainly consists of prompts while talking to people or moving your mouse over objects and clicking on them. The occasional action seen will be a bit more interesting, but overall the gameplay is only a vehicle to deliver to story, don't expect anything addictive or innovative. Design The Walking Dead is made using a cell shaded art style, similar to the Borderlands series. It works marvelously, as it gives the game a realistic feel without appearing cartoony or arcadey. The environments and characters all look great, as do the zombies and the mangled corpses you come across.The sound quality in the game is phenomenal, which is to be expected in a dialogue heavy game like this. The only flaw I found with the design of the game occurs during some conversations and some action seens. Occasionally while talking, after inputting your selection, the game will skip over what the other characters are saying in order for Lee to say the line you chose. Also, during action scenes, occasionally there will be a jump between the animations once you make a selection, i.e. choosing to hit a crawling zombie will make the zombie warp to a position where you can hit it. These flaws are noticeable and can be annoying to some. Technical & Achievements Minus the hiccups mentioned in the previous section, the game runs very smoothly on the maximum settings. Thanks to the cell shaded styling, the game isn't very GPU heavy, except for some high action moments. The game provides a decent settings menu for graphics and audio, as well as options to remove the HUD. There is three save slots available so multiple playthroughs are encourage. Make sure to keep your saves in order, as they can be used for The Walking Dead Season 2 to continue your story.The achievements for the game are incredibly easy. You literally cannot miss a single one except for two in the 400 Days DLC which are easy to obtain. Some would say this is good as it does not detract from the experience. I would agree with those people. TL;DR - The Walking Dead is spectacular, whether you are an existing fan of the series, or simply looking for a story that will pull you in. I would recommend you also buy the DLC 400 Days as it adds more to wonderfully crafted world. Buy this game.  ",144,26,3,6,18,0,11

The storyline changes as you progress, depending on choices you have made along the way.  There is brutal zombie killing (so far with an icepick, fir axe, shotgun) but it is not the focus of the game.I highly recommend it if you like walkind dead, the topic of zombie survival, or just good horror story telling.

												This game is friggin' awesome! It'll make you laugh, cry, and if you're like me.. Yell at the screen in frustration. Yeah its a real emotional rollercoaster from start to finish and its just done so darn well. Personally I don't think I've ever got so attached to characters in any game before. Their stories and actions will force you to make some hard decisions and since everything you do changes the way the game plays out, you might walk away a different person inside after its all said and done. Its got lots of dialogue, some light puzzles, and plenty of action for what is mainly an interactive storybook.

												While not much of a 'game', it's more like an interactive story, I would still like to recommend playing The Walking Dead. Don't buy this game expecting an action-packed zombie survival game, because it is far from it. In fact, all the 'gameplay' in this game consists of clicking on specific items in the scene to inspect them or pick them up, point-and-click style. There are not even puzzles to solve and there is not really any difficulty in the game (which makes investigating scenes feel a bit 'slow' at times). Just try to get immersed, get emotionally attached to the characters, don't hate on the 'cheap' emotional manipulation and enjoy the story! Because, even though the story borrows serveral 'scenes'/ideas from the TV series and it isn't too original overall, it IS enjoyable enough to be worth the money (if you buy it on sale anyway..)

												The Walking Dead Is less a game as it is interactive fiction, but that's not a slight but a compliment as you will feel truly involved in your characters actions, choices and destiny. There are elements of old school adventure games here and there with some puzzles and acquiring items, but generally your biggest weapon will be the actions you take and you will need to make the right ones quickly. The game is hard to explain to someone who hasn't played it, you can fully describe the mechanics but it won't do the title justice, it's one of those games you need to 'play' to fully appreciate its uniqueness and craft.The story and acting is top notch and impressive, you will feel drawn into it and it is on par with the series and my limited knowledge of the comics. Visually I'm not as big a fan, stylistically everything sits in a weird place between comic and cartoon and has a tendency to be at odds with the darkness of the narrative. The animations are also a bit janky having been key framed and manually done rather than captured, facial expressions sometimes being a little over exaggerated at times, looking almost Disney in execution. For such a brutal and honest game, it doesn't always gel and can distance you from the moment briefly. Overall though The Walking Dead has been really well done and I am tempted to go day one with Season 2. Telltale have shown they have the skills to deliver a substantial and well written adventure game, I am looking forward to their work with the recently announced Game of Thrones and Borderlands titles and will buy without hesitation based on their work here. While my game time on PC is short, I have completed all the original episodes on iPad bar the bridging one for the sequel 400 days. I am currently replaying on PC in preparation for Season 2 and exporting my save game over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Walking Dead tells a great story and is good through and through. It shows you can make a zombie video game without needing it to center around fighting zombies rather through dealing with other humans and their interaction. This game is a great piece of storytelling. 400 Days is alright, but honestly not very important in general and doesnt develop its characters very well. It is easily missable. I do recommend the main game however.			",514,82,8,39,17,4,38

												I love this game! Been following the series on netflix (still not up to Season 4 but getting there). I like how everything you do effects the outcome of what goes on. The story is really cool to watch unfold and you get pretty invested in the characters. I haven't made it all the way through just yet but, I am enjoying the journey for sure! One of the better games I have played and I am looking forward to Season 2!**UPDATED REVIEW 1/27/2014**All right, so I have completed 100% on this game including the 400 Days DLC (which is great all on it's own). I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS GAME!!! I admit, there were some tear jerker moments which had me going. That to me is what makes a game great. If it is able to pull out all those emotions while you're playing it. Truly this is one of the best games I have ever played! I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the show or novels.			",38,4,0,2,2,0,2

												A grim adventure game which quite successfully mixes drama, puzzles and action sequences. Inspired by the Walking Dead graphic novel series, the game puts you in the role of a regretful convicted criminal at the dawn of a zombie apocalypse.The story is dark and goes to some depressing places, it's well told and bleak but with some lighter moments too. Each chapter of the story is and has its own focus, playing out very much like a TV series would. There's a larger overarching narrative, whilst each episode has its own core dillemma. Your choices in each episode have varying degrees of impact of the following scenes and episodes, with some particularly shocking moments and tough choices.I got about 2 - 3 hours out of each episode, for about 12 hours of total game time, which impressed me for an adventure game of this nature. The 'cinematic quality' of each episode improved as they went along, it felt like Telltale really hit their stride around episode 3, then start using some interesting camera angles and cinematic techniques for episode 4 and 5.A second 'season' is in production, so keep your save files handy.

Along the way he stumbles upon all characters from every walk of life, including one little girl named Clementine.  As a role playing game it allows you to predetermine the outcomes, choose which side to take and where abouts you'll end up, which you will have to deal with the consequences (whether good or bad).Fell in love with this game and would recommend it to anyone!

												I opened a Steam account only to buy this game; the slippery slope I got into is a price I'd gladly pay once more for a game this freaking good.While built upon the oh-so-popular serie, the gameplay is anything but; a graphic adventure game which uses both dialogue-based and point-and-click mechanics in a way that surprises, you take the roll of Lee Everett: a survivor to the zombie apocalypse. From the very begining you find yourself having the possibility of, yes, point-clicking in the usual way of everything laid out for you, only to being suddenly thrown into a nail-bitting moment when the accuracy and speed of you doing so is the difference between life and undeath.And then you find what really drives this game: the choices you make when dealing with others. It might be something as easy as choosing day or night travelling, or something as tough as deciding wether to kill or perform CPR on a man who isn't clearly dead.This game is like a choose-your-own-adventure book on steroids; with many tough choices having only a moment (for there will be a timer, sort of like in real life) to be taken, you WILL think back to many of them, and wonder wether they were right. TWD will drag you into the story and push you such extremes you will both want to hit your monitor at times, while others you'll find you're at the verge of tears.Only reason I can think for not buying this game (other than being short on cash) is if you only like fast-paced games or care nothing for story (so fair warning). Of-freaking-course I recommend it.			",7,5,0,3,0,0,0

												[9/10] - A masterfully crafted piece of art. Telltale Games has delivered a phenomenal story, that's incredibly detailed and well thought out, and even emotionally investing at times. It's a dark and depressing story, but one with glimpses of hope that shine through like a beacon of light in the darkness of the world around you. This game tests your ability to stay focused and make tough, heart-wrenching decisions and even tests your humanity at times. It's intense one moment, and subtly peaceful the next, all the while making you wish you'd never have to really live life like that in the world they've created for you. Overall I was extremely impressed with this title, and it will forever change my opinion of point and click games. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Mass Effect, as this title easily climbs the ladder to be right next to it in terms of storytelling and decision making.			",381,70,2,36,24,3,66

												The Walking Dead easily consumes you with horror and great storytelling. You will quickly become emotionally attached with the unforgettable ensemble of characters and exceptional storyline. Even the simplest decisions scattered throughout the game ALWAYS prove just as challenging as the toughest. Crucial timed decision making and their various outcomes lead to very diverse storylines and add tons of replay value.The Walking Dead is a survival horror “point and click” adventure game that you don’t want to miss out on. Telltale pursues to entirely change any remaining naysayers opinions of the ""point and click"" genre with this release. Every aspect of this game is a precious work of art!

												I had originally played the Walking Dead to completion on a friends account but realized that the story was so compelling that I had to pick up to support Tell Tale anyway. While gameplay mechanics aren't perfect, the meaningful story and characters more than made the experience an incredibly enjoyable one. There are moments filled with stress, surprises, power, and emotion. This is due, in part, by the excellent cast of voice actors. In conclusion, if you appreciate a game with a strong story where you appreciate and anticipate whats gonna happen next, I strongly recommend the Walking Dead. I am currently replaying each episode and look forward to purchasing Season 2. I recommend playing this specific game with a controller instead of a keyboard, but this comes down to my general preference.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It moves fast, thankfully there are no unnecessary  puzzles etc and everything is in line with the story. The characters shine,  interesting and memorable. The game's full of tough choices, you will be surprised at the decisions you make under pressure and it will always make you wonder if you did the 'right thing'. In a 'survival of the fittest' post apocolytic world, there is no right or wrong, it is just survival. Compassion is hard to come by and  it is each man for himself. Most survivors are alive, but would have lost their soul. It gives you insights into how quickly our civilized society could degrade into.. given a catastrophic situation. Great game indeed, a definite recommend to everyone. I am sure you will enjoy it.Rating: A+ (Outstanding) ",185,26,3,18,9,0,28

To be honest I actually shed a tear at the end of episode 5 that's how much this game touched me which is great! I have never felt this much for a game.

												When I first played this game, episode 1 I was surprised with all the good reviews. But then I played episode 2 and my god, at the end of that, I was shocked, it was one of the best feelings I had ever had over any game ever besides the Last Of Us, I mean nothing can beat the story of that game although this does come close to it. Anyway, I haven't beaten the game but I plan too, great so far! *Note that this game is very stressful, I found myself saying things like, ""What the actual ♥♥♥♥?

												I love this game. The story is amazing, drawing you into the lives and world of the survivors you meet through the course of the game. The first episode is not as impressive as the other four, but it manages to introduce most of the major characters effectively. Each episode is a gripping experience, with very well-written characters and some genuinely emotional moments. If you love a good story and aren't put off by point-and-click gameplay, this is a must-own.			",570,191,11,107,42,4,91

												Wow. I went into this as a bit of a cynic, having found Telltale's episodic games very hit and miss. However, this series well and truly lived up to the hype. It's been a long time since I've found a game storyline so touching and engrossing. Well-written, generally well-executed and with gameplay which doesn't get in the way; indeed, the gameplay helps sell some story aspects such as an injury to the character. It's not a huge challenge in the sense of puzzles, but choices do have a significant effect on the story - which, given how engrossing it is, means a lot.There's a couple of bits which are a little too emotionally manipulative - the boy and the dog, for instance - and the final chapter is a little jarring, but otherwise it's an outstanding effort. Can't wait for the next season. Just one downside: be careful of a bug which prevents your choices from carrying over. It can be fixed (there are two preference files, just replace the old one with the newer one) but it's best to avoid having to go back too far.			",417,156,10,77,70,11,98

Fantastic story, but lacks gameplay.The Walking Dead tells the story of a Lee Everett, and a small child named Clementine who Lee looks after. It takes place during a zombie appocalypse, and has a very dark setting. While the Walking Dead offers very little gameplay (Mostly Quick-Time Events), it has a very touching story. The game makes you feel like you're talking to real people. It gives you options of what you want to say, and the other characters dialog changes based on your's. The game also offers you other choices differing from conversation. These include who you will give food to, and which people you will save. The game feels incredibly immersive and has a deep story. If you're looking for a plot-based game, pick this game up.			",139,23,1,5,15,0,4

												Ok, so I wasn't sure what to expect of the gameplay. The best to describe it is an interactive movie kind of game. It is a very story driven game where you can search areas for items or sequence triggers, it is not a FPS. I do like it very much though, its like you are in an episode of the show, choosing what Lee does. There are moments of danger where you have to react quickly to target zombies or objects or else it will end badly for you! :P Also, the choices you make impact the game, characters live or die or plot twists depending upon what you decide. I bought the base game which has 5 episodes I believe, i have finished the first episode and it took me just about 1.5 to 2 hours. I think many people will like this game :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's entirely story-driven and the fate of the characters involved is in your hands, which is what makes it beautiful in its own right.

This isn't a bad game, but the fact that it's so highly rated is more of a reflection how terrible character development and story are in all other games, rather than this being a must-play.

												The Walking Dead is brilliant, cruel, heartbreaking and shocking at the same time. There are definitely not so many games out there where you feel sorry for the zombies you have to kill! A lot of the available choices can hurt deep down in your soul and you'll regret many decisions you have to make. While playing this game I felt completely involved with the characters as the story is amazing, with several unexpected and shocking twists!If you're an adventure genre fan this game is an absolute must have, though it is more of an interactive story than an adventure. I'd also highly recommend it to anyone who tends to avoid this genre, especially if you're also a fan of the comics or tv-show.The 400 Days DLC fell a bit short on the amount of content in my opinion, but is still worth it. Just grab it on sale! ;D			",723,877,4,140,111,4,81

												In a world where everyone is infected and nobody is safe, your actions will speak louder then words. Every choice you make has a concequence, everything you do will change the outcome of the game. Telltale does a fantastic job in writing and moving the story. Hold onto your butts and be ready to be hit hard in the feels for what is one of the best games I've ever had the experience of playing. A MUST own or at least playthrough by all gamers of all types.			",47,24,0,15,7,1,6

												Super awesome story, loved it so much. It would be just such a good game, if it it weren't for for the fact that if it ever crashes you will lose all of your saves. Happened twice. Other than the hardly ever starting up without doing some tinkering and losing your saves, this is an awesome game.			",91,16,1,6,5,1,12

												When you first play the game, the one thing that hits you is the art style; Designed around the illustrations of The Walking Dead comics with a completely new cast of characters. The game is solely based on the decisions of the player, from things to say; to pivotal plot points, the game gives you a variety of options to choose from and a limited time to do so. Throughout the game you can get very attached to the characters, one minute everything's fine, the next you're sent into shock as something may have gone horribly wrong. This is what the game does well and builds its story around this alongside the problems and drama you will face. This interesting point and click adventure asks the player to scavenge and be creative with how they handle situations;  using a pillow to silence a gun or even distracting zombies with TVs on display in a store. Also the game has a system where each character will remember your actions and recall them later on in the story; this can be when you don't take sides with someone or when you don't agree with their ideas. This can lead to characters holding grudges or characters willing to back you up.It's episodic format what originally helped the pacing of the game; each ending on a different note that will cause you to buy the next episode to continue those compelling moments of the story much like when you read the hardback comics. Although since all the episodes are out, you can buy all of them together and play through the them all. Honestly the story is what I like about the game the most; this is because at the end you make a choice that will cause you sadness either way; even when Lee is bitten there is no escape from his fate. Even after you've finished playing you will remember the game for it's strong characters, some have which may have died and some may have survived.  ",78,30,1,4,11,0,3

												I love this game. The story is amazing, drawing you into the lives and world of the survivors you meet through the course of the game. The first episode is not as impressive as the other four, but it manages to introduce most of the major characters effectively. Each episode is a gripping experience, with very well-written characters and some genuinely emotional moments. If you love a good story and aren't put off by point-and-click gameplay, this is a must-own.			",570,191,11,107,42,4,91

												Don't be fooled by the art (which I think is superb btw). This game has a very dark and engaging story filled with profanity and incredibly shocking graphical moments.It sets a new standard in Point-and-Click adventures. I've never played a game that heavily customises the way you perceive the main story based on the choices you've made.There are no wrong choices. Select truthfully and the game will reward you with an outcome that you deserve and will understand. Even if you think it's a bad choice. You'll appreciate the story much more and thank me at the very end.There's probably enough alterations in this game to warrant 2 more play throughs. There's no multiple alternate endings like some games do. All the changes happen as the story is being told. What you do in episode 2 might change something in episode 4. Lee Everett ... lol, what a name XDThe game is about 14 hours in length for first play through. I bought it for $12.50 and no regrets if it goes cheaper the next day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I began ""The Walking Dead"", I honestly did not know what to expect. The only thing I knew about it before-hand was that it has gotten worldwide critical acclaim and that it was sort of like a point-and-click kind of game, which I'm not too big of a fan of. When I started playing it, however, my thoughts started to change. By the time I had completed episode 1, I was eager to beat the game just to find out what happens. Surprisingly, the game isn't too heavy on gameplay. Instead, the story is what drives the game forward. I was always excited to play the game so I could find out what would happen to the characters. The game has a ton of drama and suspence to spice up the plot, which is needed since the plot is what the game relies on. The fact that the game changes depending on the choices you make is (to me) one of the biggest and greatest features of the game, and it adds a lot of replay value.By the end of the story (which isn't terribly long, maybe 12 hours or so), I had gotten so emotionally attatched to the characters, which made the ending one of the saddest endings I have ever witnessed in a game. It seriously made me teary-eyed. So, in conclusion, ""The Walking Dead"" isn't heavy on gameplay, but that's not really what the game's supposed to be about, and you just have to adapt to it. It's the story that makes it incredible, especially the fact that it changes depending on the choices you make.9/10, would recommend to anybody who would like a good story or fans of the TV show/comic.

												I went into The Walking Dead with few expectations. I was only vaguely familiar with the comic's existence. I believe the show had at least started, but what little I'd seen of it bored me. I wasn't even particularly familiar with Telltale Games at the time, outside of knowing they handled newer takes on the Monkey Island and Sam & Max properties. That was it. And now, I can easily say The Walking Dead remains one of, if not, their best adventure game, even with more of the same world and visits to other worlds adopting the choices-with-consequence model The Walking Dead established.Right off the bat, The Walking Dead manages to establish its setting at a breakneck pace without being confusing or unclear. You're in Georgia. You're in trouble. Then suddenly, you -and- Georgia, and the whole world for that matter, are in a whole lot more trouble than anyone bargained for. The core cast gets established fairly quickly, then the pace begins to ease up a bit to give you time to get comfortable with your new avatar and his associates. Lee, the one left to rot. Clementine, the one left behind. Kenny, the one left to act. And there are plenty of supporting characters, all distinct, many memorable, helping hold up these eventual pillars of the story as well.One point of contrast between how conversations and action sequences is handled in The Walking Dead really struck me: it's the little things, like what you choose to say or whom you choose to say it to, that have the longest-running impact and the greatest effect on your overal experience of the game, and in most cases, there's no undo. Meanwhile, coming back from failure during a quick-time-event, which typically ends in fatality, is almost instant, and is the closest thing to ""fixing"" any of your actions you get a chance to do. This really helps emphasize the importance of the characters and their interaction over any sort of outside actors or circumstances that is the core of the game on the whole.If you decide to play through The Walking Dead, you're going to cry. You're going to yell, too, and smile. You'll love some characters, you'll hate others. And the best thing is? It's unlikely the moments and people that fit those lists for you will match up exactly with anyone else. Even if you're not a fan of the other Walking Dead media properties, you owe it to yourself to play this game.			",836,398,38,114,89,9,112

												Telltale's spin on The Walking Dead is in many ways a success. The graphics on the game are pretty good. The story line, though extremely linear, is one that you can definitely enjoy in a single playthrough. The characters are, for the most part, well thought out, and engaging. Lee and Clem are both easy characters to love, along with their entertwining story. **Spoiler Alert** From this point on there will be portions of the game that will give away some of the storyline.  I almost freaked out when they had me dream that she became a walker. O.o  Some of the things that I think would have really pushed this game over the top if they had been better are as follows. The ability to TRULY choose my own story, I've played through many of the episodes 2-3 times trying to gain different outcomes, but it always ends up the same. Even when you choose between saving different people Telltale takes the choice away from you later on so that you have to follow the story line they've laid out.  Take for instance saving Carly or Doug. It doesnt matter because they both die later due to Lilly going insane, and there's NO WAY to stop it from happening. I replayed the episode 3 times before finally googling it to see if there was any way to stop Lilly and found that there wasn't. This to me is the major flaw to this, and all of the other Telltale games. They're not truly unique stories, and you can't truly change the way things happen in the end no matter what you choose. My biggest gripe with this series, as well as the other games I've played of theirs is that I can't really change the story, just a few minor plot points. If you're going to sell a game as a ""Choose your own Adventure"" type game, then please make it actually be able to be played through multiple times with different outcomes each time based on choices of the player. In closing, I absolutely love the idea behind TWD, and the GoT series by Telltale, however they've sold us majorly short in my opinion on the whole ""Choose"" part of the adventure, it is nothing more than smoke and mirrors while they push the linear game that they wrote on you as a player. The games at face value are fun to play through once for sure, maybe even twice if you want to change the persona your character has, but not much more than that as the story never really changes.  Would I recommend this game? Yes when it's on sale. Just don't expect as much as I did when buying it.			",55,20,0,13,36,2,19

												Overall pretty good. The game has a few down points but all in all I would give it 70/100 (50 is average). The game basically follows a group of people surviving the Zpocolypse like the show. It plays as an interactive story and the player makes choices for the main character. There isn't any gameplay really it is just point and click for I would say 75% of the game. The rest are small real time button mashes that you have to do, which are really kinda pointless in my opinion. The good thing about the game is that zombies are actually a pretty big part of the game unlike many ""zombie"" genre media that turns into nothing but soap operahs with a few zombies in the background as plot motivators. A qucik look around the internet and you will find that people get pretty emotionally invovled in this game, so thats always a good sign. For me, it wasn't as engaging but still well worth the time to go through it. Hard to say much else without spoiling the game for those who haven't played it.For the not-so-good. I think the most fusterating part of the game is the controls. They are very loose and don't always work. The control scheme can be annoyingly difficult to manipulate at times. The other major issue was as with almost all choice based games there are often times when my personal choice just wasn't an option. You get 2 or maybe 3 choices and none of them are what I considered good so your left with just picking the least bad. That kinda kicks you out of the emersion a bit. Lastly, story wise and this is a little bit of a spoiler I guess, but eventually you realize that none of the choices ""really"" matter in the game. It plays out pretty much exactly as it always will and ends up the same, just the dialogue is a bit different along the way. That is a dissapointment, but understandable considering the game would be huge otherwise and would be pretty hard to navigate the players through a understandable story.Some other critique I have is mostly in the way of graphics. Overall it is a good style and the game looks good, but there are gliches here and there and the animations are sometimes wonky. Nothing game breaking or really bad but a lack of polish nontheless. So overall worth it. If you like this sort of game it is definitely worth picking up. If on the fence, it is worth picking up on a steam sale. I played it straight through and the play time is accurate so probably 12-16 hours for most people.			",225,78,3,50,26,0,43

												Rarely have I seen a story so well developped, characters so lifelike, group dynamics so accurately rendered, a general ambiance so gripping in a videogame. The gameplay itself may be fairly basic, the graphics aren't bad or even bland but they aren't eye candy at all. Yet it hardly matters as this game's forte lies entirely elsewhere. The consequences of your every actions on the story line keep  you constantly wondering, involved and waiting in quiet, tense expectation for whatever will come next. The Walking Dead does not really deliver the horror or adrenaline that the title or scenario suggests, it does not compete with tenors of the survival genre, but it does deliver a deep and long lasting experience and is without a single doubt a masterpiece.

												Just like other titles (The Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series, for example) this game is a masterpiece. The more it goes further, the better it gets. The more its history reveals, the more you want to discover. It's one of those games which can hold the player to the screen till its end.

												Quite possibly the best experience I've ever had with a computer (even better than pron).There just aren't word to describe this game (or rather, an interactive movie). The storyline throws though decisions at you at every corner and makes you feel various emotions, especially at the end. Looking back at my play time, it had 21 hours with not much replay value, but feels like so much more and the story is unforgetable. It costs $25, but the experience with making your own choices is priceless. Just buy it100/10 which reduces to a 10			",50,13,0,4,10,0,1

												Honestly, I didn't plan on getting this game initially, I had watched a few people play it before, and it felt like it was just another game. But thats when you're a spectator, picking up the game yourself, you have to deal with a whole new reality. This isn't an instance where you can backseat game or pause the video for an answer. You have to act in the there and now, making split second decisions and reactions that otherwise could have dire consequences in how events play out in the story. Granted, the story is a heart jerker, there's no denying that, but if you enjoy a story for a content, the rich life of the seams that exist between the beginning and end of the fabric as it were, then you will play this game. There are many different paths that this game follows, and it is impossible to say which one you will go down. Whether it be on purpose, or you hit a key on accident, you cannot undo what you have done. This game focuses on the reality of living in a world of the dead. While it does follow a set story to an extent, the bonds you build with most of the characters feels real and sincere, the same goes with the friends you don't make. Enemies in small groups you're forced with can often lead to butting heads and arguements even if they only slightly disagree. Weigh your options carefully, and tread softly, in the land of Telltales ""The Walking Dead"".			",25,10,0,8,9,0,6

												A very story driven narrative which is well put together. The voice acting and dialogue is good and I found myself invested in the characters. The visual design is very stylised and as a result manages to remain looking great (and will not date) despite not requiring or using current graphical power and techniques.The gameplay is light, being primarily point and click with the occasional QTE or gallery shooting section. Normally this would switch me off but the important thing here is the narrative and this more than makes up for the lack of gameplay elements.People have complained that your decisions do not change the outcomes enough on multiple playthroughs, this is partly true, there are events in the game that are out of your control. I have found that this in some respects is nessesary to keep the narritive tight and can help build a sense of hopelessness as well. More often than not, even if your actions do not change a physical outcome, they do change characters views of you and that can come back to bite you later.All in all I recommend this if you have wanted a story focused zombie apocalypse game and were disapointed with things like the disparity between the dead island trailer and what the game wound up being. It isn't a perfect game (lack of gameplay elements) but it is worth playing.  ",176,61,2,35,14,0,28

												TLDR - Virtual comic book with QTE.My Rating - 7.5/10Plot:-The game takes place in the same fictional world as the comic, with events occurring shortly after the onset of the zombie apocalypse in Georgia. However, most of the characters are original to the game, which centers on university professor and convicted murderer Lee Everett, who helps to rescue and subsequently care for a young girl named Clementine. Kirkman provided oversight for the game's story to ensure it corresponded to the tone of the comic, but allowed Telltale to handle the bulk of the developmental work and story specifics. Some characters from the original comic book series also make in-game appearances.Although replay value is a little low despite the fact of it being a game that lets you control the outcome of an ending, it is still indeed a thrilling, suspensful and stressful game all at the same time.DLC content (400 Days) was a little disappointing to be honest. Didn't have much back story on it and it was left with a huge cliff hanger. Unlike the original story line, which we all know that it continues off with season 2. But for $3, I guess it wasn't that bad after all.Not the best Telltale series game yet but it still is worth the money if you're a big Walking Dead fan.			",38,33,3,4,2,2,1

												OK this game has 20000 reviews so I'll be short. As an adventure game amateur I was really blown away by the great atmosphere, the expressive characters , and the difficult choices this game give you, as well as the alternative endings. The story is really intense, even at times unrealisticly so, but mostly it's well orchestrated, there is a great story in this game.The story and genereal atmosphere and graphic is so great in fact that it might blind you to the flaws of the game. The gameplay in itself is really minimalistic, it's there but compared to the storytelling part of the game, it kind of feels anemic. The puzzles are very simple and\or obvious , and it feels like the designers didn't want anything to go in the way of the story. The quick time events with the weird q button are more annoying than scary, I have gone through the game but I still haven't figured out how it works. I kind of liked the action sequences involving fighting and guns but this was rather primitive as well.  Still it's obvious for me that a ""the walking dead"" serie is the future of adventure gaming, with atmospheric graphics, deep characters and convoluted storylines. However gameplay must be a part of it to really hit the spot, with real puzzles to solve.As it stand The Walking Dead is dangerously close to be an interactive story with different endings, nothing wrong with this kind of games especially when it's well done like this one, but I really think it could be more with some added gameplay especially in the puzzle section. With a little luck Telltales will deliver something like that soon, and we might just experience a new golden age in the adventure game scene...			",192,88,1,44,13,0,24

												I've been playing point and click since I was a kid.  My very first computer game was a point and click.  I was a bit skeptical about these games since there are no puzzles, so they are not really traditional point and click games (i.e. Monkey Island, Sam and Max, etc) but I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  Wonderful story telling.  I loved how life or death everything felt and you felt like you were really making these decisions for these people and the consequences that were happening because of them.  Solid all the way through.  I won't say much about it because it's too good to give anything away. I swear I didn't cry.... no really... for real...			",101,146,2,29,28,0,17

												With The Walking Dead, Telltale have brought their signature gameplay style and aesthetic to a new level. While their previous efforts often stumbled in the story compartment, The Walking Dead is one of the best stories ever told in gaming and is worth your time and money, even at full price.The aesthetic the game resembles the comic it is based on, with dark outlines on everything and an overall cartoony style. The tone of the game is quite dark, but the aesthetic somehow fits regardless.The gameplay is based on a lot of simple puzzle solving, as well as quick time events and decision making. The conversation system is robust and offers several options for you to pursue in any conversation, and they affect the game in a small way. There are major decisions you have to make throughout the five episodes that will affect your story. It's no Mass Effect, but the choices you make still matter and will affect which characters live, and which characters die a horrible painful death.Gametime is about 12 hours with almost no filler (unless you get stuck on a puzzle).I recommend this game wholeheartedly, even if you were not a fan of Telltale's previous work. Haven't played the 400 Days DLC yet. ",544,140,12,67,49,6,81

												If I had to describe The Walking Dead in one word I would say ""Brutal"". While this sounds like a criticism it is anything but. It's brutal, raw, and unbelievably good, but more on this later. The pacing, with incredibly tense moments (the truly amazing thing is that there are probably more tense dialog exchanges then action moments) juxtaposed with gut wrenching loss and tender hopeful moments, is masterful. The fact that critical decisions must be made (or not made) quickly works terrifically and is completely immersive. On a whole the conversation system is one of the better ones out there. Almost always you can tell from the prompt the content AND tone of the response which most systems fail to do. The characters are believable, varied, and deep but there were a couple times you could see your previous interactions with the person causing some seemingly out of character moments. Overall the mechanics and graphics, combined with a minimal but very effective soundtrack, are superb. Now about the feelies...While I don't want to get into what is and isn't a game, this most certainly is a game but the goals are just different then you may be used to. There are no points, there is no winning. This is the mindset you need to be in when going into this game. If you are unwilling to let your guard down, unwilling to feel, unwilling to actually immerse yourself in the story and live with your choices then you will walk away disappointed. This game is really a pure RPG. It doesn't need all the typical mechanics because that's not what defines a role playing game. I can not emphasize enough how much you can get out of this game if you are willing to lose yourself in it and make the decisions that feel right in your gut and heart, not the ones you think will give you a better ending. Once those decisions are made you need to live with them. You will second guess them, you will wonder if things would have turned out differently, and you most likely will come to regret something you did or said. That is part of why I led with the word ""brutal"". There are hard, nearly impossible, decisions that you have to make and live with in mere seconds. If you play this game and don't strongly feel at least some emotions, if it doesn't wear you down and weigh on your thoughts, you are not tough, you are not cool. You are short changing yourself. You are missing an opportunity to learn about yourself. As gamers we are constantly told our hobby is mindless entertainment, with little or no redeeming value. The Walking Dead is ready to prove that wrong, if you'll just let it.--- 400 Days DLC---400 Days is not meant to be the total emotional wringer that Season 1 was. It isn't trying to draw you in deep to a single character and experience. As such it won't have the same impact as Season 1 but that's fine because it wasn't supposed to. I think the problem is calling it Season 1 DLC when in reality its more of a bridge between seasons. You play 5 different, but intertwined, stories that introduces characters you are likely to meet and maybe play as in Season 2.Really the impact will just be delayed. When you're playing Season 2 and you know from experience a characters back story it gives a lot more weight to their existence, or lack their of. In Season 1 some of the early deaths didn't have a big emotional impact because we knew nothing about the character. If you play 400 Days that will change in Season 2. An early loss of one of these characters will carry some weight since you'll feel like you know them and will have formed an opinion of them. That being said there are still a couple of of those signature Walking Dead moments, showing how good Tell Tale is at this since they were able to set them up in only 15-20 minutes.If you are planning on playing Season 2 then I highly recommend 400 Days. It will wet your appetite for Season 2 and and should make it even more enjoyable, that brutal, visceral Walking Dead enjoyability.			",209,73,5,15,17,2,31

												The Walking Dead has one of those universes where anything can happen and the possiblies are endless. I loved palying as Lee and protecting Clem as we fight The Undead...and The Living. The season was great even though I knew what happen 2 years before I bought the game. The stories that reminded me of the stories and conflicts in the show and comics are similar. The choices in this game aren't hard once you have an idea about it, but living with your choice can change you. I also like how you grew with the characters like Lee and Carley (If you chose to save Carley). I also liked the easter egg like a truck that says ""♥♥♥♥♥♥Happens""; like Rick Grimes says in The Walking Dead TV Show Season 4 (Spoilers) when he uses a machete and kills Thomas in self defense. Other things like the comic book appearance of Glenn and Hershel...not the show but comic versions. (The game is connected with the comics and novels, not the show) Well anyways I liked this game and I recommend this to any TWD fan.			",15,6,0,0,1,0,0

You will quickly become emotionally attached with the unforgettable ensemble of characters and exceptional storyline. Even the simplest decisions scattered throughout the game ALWAYS prove just as challenging as the toughest. Crucial timed decision making and their various outcomes lead to very diverse storylines and add tons of replay value.The Walking Dead is a survival horror “point and click” adventure game that you don’t want to miss out on. Telltale pursues to entirely change any remaining naysayers opinions of the ""point and click"" genre with this release. Every aspect of this game is a precious work of art!

												Definately a great immersive experience, but should be considered an interactive, visual novel. It has a great atmosphere, a strong narative and contains characters that express their feelings and opinions that produce and environment that is both believable and realistic.Although an unusual art-style, the game's artwork is unique and exhibits a sketch drawing style that is similar to the original walking dead comics.This 5 episode series introduces tough choices and experiences which can alter the storyline depending on your choice, giving awesome replayability, drama and action. Although the conclusion never changes depending on your choices, just being able to voice your opinion and communicate with the characters is more than enough to satisfy the player. The first episode might be mediocre, but it does develop and interesting events occur. Rating: 9/10 Although the gameplay elements are limited, this is still a great time-consuming story to enjoy and experience wether you are up for the price and the appocalyptic and eerie atmosphere. I couldn't recommend this game more.			",69,7,0,12,3,0,12

												The most awesome game ever. The emotions created by this game are incredibly real. You feal real anger and pity for the haracters and the choices you make are really hard. And the game forces you to decide quicly! Wrong decicions got real consequences but you cnnot just load a save and change it. You have to live with your choices to the end of the game which makes your choices so much more hard and real. Just amazing work from Taletale that is currently KING of storytelling!

												Many games claim to have interactive storytelling, but very few pull it off as well as The Walking Dead does. More than just a zombie themed Point-and-Click adventure, The Walking dead features a incredibly well writen, believeable and above all, likeable cast of characters. Characters that will live and possibly die by your hands. The choices you make in this game do matter, and a small action you may have forgotten about could very well crop up again several episodes later.  Even if you think the zombie genre is overdone, pick up this game. You will not regret it.			",189,22,2,18,10,1,10

												The first few episodes feel linear, but establish the plots, characters, and setting really well. By about halfway through they hit their rythme and I really felt like I was in control of the story. A must buy for any Walking Dead fan, and a great buy for anyone else looking for an adventure game with a great story.			",234,61,2,44,6,3,28

												Simply, amazing.This is, I think, the best game I have ever played in the last 18 months; TWD has an amazing story, a good choice system which really tugs your morale system and has you pausing the game making the choice (rather than being pressured by the timer!) or googling to see what other people did... I believe this justifies a good story!The gameplay can be infuriating at times.. a lot of walking back and forth tapping A (controller) on things to see if that's what you're looking for.Combat: combat is fairly limited to RT (mouse 1 click) for a gun or A to kick a zombie in the face.This game should be purchased for the narration and story, not the game mechanics.

												When I heard people/editorials praising this game and how ""emotional"" and ""attatched"" you get to the characters I thought to myself ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no f'ing way.""This was because Video games as a medium has failed to show me any emotional aspects in the past. I've had games where i felt bad for some characters, but for the first time I felt myself actually discovering/getting to know/care about fictional characters. I wanted to choose decisions which would benefit the characters. Every pivotal dialouge choice was so pain stakingly difficult as there usually was no exact ""benefit everyone!"" answer. Although the game is nothing much than an ""interactive"" movie, your decions ultimately do matter as they change some dialouge choices and who lives/dies. And to confess yes i did shed some MANLY TEARS in the last chapter. God damn. The game will really catch you by surprise, and shock you at how effective it is at making you immersed in its world. You won't notice at first ,but when the twists and turns jump out (and the game does this fast, even in the very first episode things go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll really start to realize that you do care for what happens to the people inside the game.It's worth the price of  full admission to experience one of the finest games ever to be concocted last year. If  it's on sale it's a must have.			",487,94,12,18,11,1,20

												I was not by any means a Walking Dead fan until I played these games. I tried watching the TV series and I couldn't get in to them. Mainly because I was tired of the whole zombie smash kill apocalypse thing, and I never thought any other zombie experience would be able to captivate me. Then I stumbled upon The Walking Dead Game. This game is a story telling masterpiece with writing on par with the likes of Metal Gear Solid. It is most likely the best game I've played in 2012 and I have already named it my game of the year. It has very interesting characters that you'll care about and twists and turns you'll never see. From Clementine a lone little girl you begin to care for to Lee the mystery of a man you begin to play. It is a thrillride with the backdrop of the zombie apocalypse, and this time around the zombies took a backseat to the characters. It is an entirely different perspective of a would be zombie apocalypse and I HIGHLY recommend you do your self a favor and play this wonderful game. This game isn't about zombies, it is about a touching story of people and their will and spirit to live and survive while fighting to maintain their humanity. This game will break you emotionally, but it is such a beautiful and touching experience that I'm thankful to have been able to play it.			",101,29,1,10,9,2,16

												Telltale never ceases to amaze me! This game is really amazing, and nothing like I've seen out there. This game is all about the story and how a game can really make you care about its characters.This five episodes adventure will make you cling on your chair and think carefully on every choice you'll make, because everything has a consequence. There is no ""Black or White"", ""Good or Evil"". It's all about survival in a chaotic world.The gameplay may scare people away for being a point and click adventure, but if you like a good story, give this game a shot and you won't regret it.This game is worth every cent you spend on it.9/10			",142,28,2,27,23,1,9

												This is a story based, zombie apocalypse, point and click, emotional roller coaster with some action elements. Story follows group of people who try to survive in the world filled with mindless walking dead, who roam and eat the living. Based on books and TV show of The Walking Dead, with it's own twist. Game doesn't look anything special visually, and has a grim cartoony look to it, but what it lacks graphically it delivers emotionally in spades. Game has choice and consequence system, people remember what you did or said and it can bite you hard later in the game.I'm a 30 year old grown man, and man tears were shed at the end of the game. I think this was the most emotional moment I experienced in all of my life. Insane voice acting power. The Walking Dead TV Show needs to make notes off of this. Great piece. Recommended.

												I really have to say this game is almost perfection. I was worried about it going in that it would focus too much on random zombie action and take away from WHY we love the Walking Dead. We like it because it actually has story and character development. Not just random gore. The game is a point and click adventure. If that's not your type of game wait for the crappy FPS coming out soon. and about gameplay, There is not much gameplay in it, you walk here and there and talk to other people and every now and then you need to make choices (for most of them there is a short time limit).There are a lot likable (and not so likable) characters. Together with the choices you have to make, it is a thrilling and emotional experience. You have not always the time to think about, just react, but if your reactions are bad you can have troubles now or after, consequences brought by your decisions. And just like on real life, some of them you will have to carry with you until the end of story. ",110,12,4,12,15,0,9

Each decision changes the story like a read your own adventure book but as you go from episode to episode your relationships with characters grow stronger and you find yourself caring as if making a decision actually has an impact on your own life in some way. It's the ultimate in moral growth.I definitely recommend this game.			",327,50,11,18,35,4,24

												The Walking Dead I a spin off game of the Walking Dead Series originally created by Robert Kirkman. This game was created by TellTale Games, and is just another amazing game to add to their repertoire.Gameplay:  You play either as Lee, (the main character), or as Clementine, as you move through the game. As Lee, your main goal throughout the game is to ensure the safety of Clementine, the little girl you meet near the beginning. The choices that you make directly affect what kind of relationship your character has with Clementine, as well as all the other characters in the game. The movements and controls are really smooth, throughout the entire game. It was not an overly challenging game, so even inexperienced gamers will have a relatively easy playthrough. Graphics:The graphics for this game were incredible. Everything looked almost too real to believe it came from a game. You can easily just stop and stare at the landscape around you. Jaw-dropping is the word I used the first time I had the chance to really get into the game.Audio:The voice acting was phenomenal. They really did an amazing job making the emotions really come alive. The music also complimented the atmosphere the game was trying to accomplish.Storyline:The follows the experiences of Lee and Clementine as they move through the apocalyptic zombie-ridden world. As you proceed through the game, the relationship between Lee and Clem gets more pronounced. Even though they are not related, they act as though they are. I felt like Lee took on the role of 'Uncle.' They are basically inseperable and Lee is more than the main reason why Clementine made it to the end. Her taught her everything he possibly could to help her survive.This game blew me away. I loved everything about it. From the unbelievable graphics to the voice actors and the storyline itself, everything wrapped together made for a truly amazing game. I was highly invested emotionally invested in the characters, and the tears at the end made it all seem that much more real. I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone!!

												Definately a great immersive experience, but should be considered an interactive, visual novel. It has a great atmosphere, a strong narative and contains characters that express their feelings and opinions that produce and environment that is both believable and realistic.Although an unusual art-style, the game's artwork is unique and exhibits a sketch drawing style that is similar to the original walking dead comics.This 5 episode series introduces tough choices and experiences which can alter the storyline depending on your choice, giving awesome replayability, drama and action. Although the conclusion never changes depending on your choices, just being able to voice your opinion and communicate with the characters is more than enough to satisfy the player. The first episode might be mediocre, but it does develop and interesting events occur. Rating: 9/10 Although the gameplay elements are limited, this is still a great time-consuming story to enjoy and experience wether you are up for the price and the appocalyptic and eerie atmosphere. I couldn't recommend this game more.			",69,7,0,12,3,0,12

												Overall this game was a unique experience that is not your everyday type of game, but is worth playing and I would suggest this game to almost anyone. It is a game that simply tells a beautiful and tragic story. It sucks you in emotionally and does not let go. i have not played any other game that has got me to care about video game characters so much.			",201,30,6,16,13,1,33

												It's a beautiful game, like wow though if the ending doesn't make you cry, you either have no heart or you're like my little brother, and you're a flipping a-hole with no emotions.This game was worth my entire TF2 backpack, which is what I sold to buy this butt cheek.

												This is one of the best adventure / drama games to have come out in quite a long time.  You play as ""Lee"" a likable protagonist with a questionable background.   You are thrown head-first into the world of ""The Walking Dead"" from the comics and TV shows.As you progress you will come across the same locations and characters that Rick does in the comics, yet at different times than Rick.  The decisions you make in each chapter carry forward so they have true consequence.   How do you decide who will live or who will die?   Think quickly or you'll all be overrun.I would give it a solid 91% on the Yeti scale of greatness.			",569,150,23,70,69,9,112

												    I picked this game up after hearing a lot about it during a summer sale and never really got around the actually playing until my SO, who watched the first season of the TV show, questioned me about it on my desktop.     I knew beforehand what type of game I was in for, and decided to invite my significant other to play along with me, thinking it would be an easy game to introduce her into the part of the video game world that WASN'T Mario Kart.    This is the perfect game for this situation. Got a friend or significant other you want to play a game with, and one or both of you are new to games? This is right up your alley. The game plays like more of a interactive movie. The controls are (for the most part) easy to understand, and the plot is very inticing, and the characters are what make this game so perfect. You wont find a single character (except for one, i've heard) that crosses into another part of The Walking Dead universe, and this game requires no previous knowledge of the series.     Seriously, pick up this game, play it with a friend or SO and you'll experience a variety of emotions with eachother. You'll have your own inside jokes about the quarks of the game, and you can open up an entire relationship with this person and future games of this kind. This is the perfect social game.

												It dosnt matter if you like the Walking Dead or just like to play a game that has many different story paths this game is a must play.The story line is amazing and keeps you thinking and guessing the entire way to the end.It has a decent gameplay length.The many different story paths gives you a chance to really get into the characters who are really easy to love or hate as they really do come alive while playing.The game has a replayablity about it where you can restart and try a different way to play the game than how you first played.The DLC is a nice extra if you are willing to buy it (not expenisive but it is short) but if you want a perfect game or the extra achievements I guess you have to.It was well worth it for myself and I am looking forward to when I get the next season.

												This is a real Masterpiece as is season 2 of it.the 400days dlc is a rippoff kinda tho, serves zero addition to season 2 besides some (useless) background ""info"". one would be better off to search for a 15min walkthrough of it on youtube and walk on imho...really enjoyed both seasons, great + intense story which I can only recommend anyone being a part of, for a while :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an absolutely brlliant game, I love that for a point and click it can be played with a controller as well as mouse+keys. Follow the heart warming tale of Lee and Clementine as they try to survive in the newly infected world. Choose which companions to save, which to kill, and make other hard decisions that affect possible outcomes while you play this game. Fantastic story, I even bought the DLC, which was good as well, short but you get to star as 5 different characters. I would recommend this game to anyone, I was not a fan of the show, but this has to be the best point and click I've ever played. (Wolf Among Us and Deponia right behind.)			",219,83,8,19,18,3,20

The Walking DeadGreat story. What a huge emotional journey!The Walking Dead is an interactive story-based game where your choices change the outcome of everything. This feature had me thinking through situations more carefully than I normally would in other games. It really feels like the characters lives are in your hands.The characters are convincing and voiced excellently. It doesn't take much to love them or hate them, depending on their role, of course.P.S. I would recommend picking up the 400 Days DLC as well, as it ties into The Walking Dead Season 2.10/10Would try not to cry, lie down, cry a lot again. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
