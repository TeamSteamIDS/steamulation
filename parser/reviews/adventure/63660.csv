												Myst is a point and click game from the olden days, where things were simpler. FMV was taking off, and a slew of adventure games came out, one of them including Myst. What made Myst so special, you ask? Well, it told a story from a new perspective, and had mind-boggling puzzles. It really gave you this sense of adventure. Sure, the game has aged like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's a good trip down memory lane. Get past the graphics, and you can treat yourself to an adventure classic. *NOTE* This game has techincal issues on Steam, and I have experienced crashes, and has made the game almost unplayable. It's very glitchy and unstable in this condition. If you desparately want the game, try out GOG. The game probably runs fine with Win XP, but watch out for anything newer.			",440,128,21,40,38,1,35

												Ladies and gentlemen: the game that put CD-ROM drives on the map. Not only was Myst a technological masterpiece at the time, it also gave adult players that same exploration and puzzle-based point and click adventure that kids were consuming in waves. Puzzles are rarely difficult, and just require you to write things down or explore everywhere, at most. The beauty of Myst is the sheer level of immersion. You're not told what to do or where to go. You just open a book and climb in, and since all you're doing is clicking stuff to interact or move, it leaves you free to explore the universe of Myst and take it all in. Be prepared to do a little reading and puzzle-solving, as well as a lot of exploration. Buy this game if you want a deep and immersive experience, if you're interested to see what all the hubbub was about back in the 90s, or can't get realMyst to run right on your computer (it can happen).

												Not very compatible with Windows 8.1.  I was hoping that the availability on Steam meant this awesome game would be miraculously ported to modern platforms, but I had the following problems:- no animations worked.  Anything that was animated just didn't happen, such as the message from Atrus giving you the clue to rotate the tower.- occasional full crashes.  You can't even use Task Manager to kill the process, you have to reset the machine to recover.  The crashes were mostly due to saving the game, but also occasionally due to animation.I got it to work through the whole Channelwood Age (+- about 5 reboots), but because of the above I had a hard stop at the clock tower, whose puzzle involves animation and continually triggered a freeze.I'm off to try realMyst-Masterpiece, which was developed much later (2014) than this (2000).UPDATE: ""realMyst: Masterpiece"" is definitely the way to go.  Even ported to a 3D engine, the game still looks visually appealing, but more important is that it is rock solid on Win 8.1, and they cleaned up a few gameplay issues.If you're interested in playing Riven, I can highly recommend the one from GOG.com over the one on Steam.  I tried both, and the GOG version was also rock-solid compared to the Steam version.			",29,20,0,4,2,0,1

												If you're like me, you've bought upwards of ten legal copies of Myst over the years and sought it out in less reputable varieties even more than that, in a desperate attempt to get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing running on modern PCs. I was able to accomplish this with this version, but if you're a fan of the series, you know damn well the first real puzzle is getting it to run. To anyone who isn't familiar: the quicktime movies are essential, so if you load up the game and just see a book and not an opening movie, you haven't figured it out yet. Keep trying.

												Myst: The [Crippled] Masterpiece Edition 8 / 10Update 4Yeah... on my win7 64bit gaming PC even with XP sp3 compatibility I am getting crashes every 5 minutes.... Why? I dunno.... gotta move on to something else... 'nuf time lost....I changed my review after getting a personal comment from Noitalever. I run a Win7 64bit Pro and to run this game requires that the Myst.exe run in compatibility mode for XP service pack 3. Find your steamapps folder > common > Myst Masterpiece Myst.exe and right click to properties. Check box for XP SP3 compatibility. Leave all other boxes clear [I tested each one and in combination without improvements]. Doing this back flip in Win8.1 requires more technical knowledge than I can explain. Better to find an updated release that specifically supports Win8.1 on another digital download service : )This compatility mode restored transitions, videos, and better volume control for at least 5 minutes. Yeah I know what you are thinking... FM sideways....I played this game in 1994 on a Mac with a 15 inch screen and it was beautiful.In this 2011 re-release to the PC you relieve the wonder of this magical release. Note that  it impossible to get this to play full screen unless someone would like to share this secret with me; there is a black box around the play screen  [Note I tried setting various screen resolutions and color depths without improvement ]This is one of those relaxed games, a thinking point and click without any time constraints. If you are a fan of this genre you will be delighted. The time to Experience this Modern Digital Art we call Games is Now. It will be very hard in the future to play Classics and so seize the day. Don't waste Time, Appreciate the modern Van Gogh's that live amongst us.			",693,342,14,62,81,6,107

												The original and iconic Myst at its best: the Masterpiece Edition. I can't reccomend it enough. It's a great point and click puzzle game where you land at a mysterious island in the possession of a strange book. You find 2 brothers stuck in 2 books, each telling you to help him and not the other. So you choose. And go on a strange book trip to help him.The puzzles aren't hard per se, but they're decontextualized. That's the hardest part of the game: trying to figure out what the hell does [insert thing here] do and to what is it related. Not that this game is hard, not at all, but you have to be good at connecting clues. Some more obvious than others (  ♥♥♥♥ing spaceship trip I tell ya  ).Now there are some things to keep in mind as this is an old game. You may not be able to play it due to compatibility issues (Windows 10 worked fine for me but 7 did not). In that case you always have the realMyst versions. Many copies have an awful bug at a certain rotating tower where it doesn't turn North or West. It forces you to check a guide for the clues but does not prevent you from leaving that Age and finishing the game. Given how old this game is there's really no tech support from the devs, so don't bother.There isn't a whole lot going for replay value besides the  4  different endings and different dialogue but it's still a wonderful experience and I definitively would love to visit the island of Myst and the remaining Ages as well.

												An utterly beautiful game. It's simplicity and odd charm still ring through today, even though it is a point and click from the early nineties. I truly love this game, and I recommend it to all who are looking for something just a little different. The puzzles are not too hard, the art is gorgeous and the story is enthralling.Best to keep a pen and some paper with you while playing though, as note taking is essential.My one complaint would be that it is too short, but to fix that there are four more games in the MYST series, going on to Riven, Myst 3: exiles, Myst 4 and Myst V. After that is URU: ages beyond Myst, and Cyan, the creators, are currently working on Obduction, the sequel to Uru. I cannot wait to get stuck into this series, and the rest of you shouldn't wait either. Myst is only 4.99 on steam and it is money well spent. So what are you waiting for? Dive in!

												Myst was one of those games that really took the world by surprise.  It's an adventure game in a first person perspective where you click on your screen to turn or move forward.  Unfortunately, the resolution is stuck at a 640x480 detail level, so full screen does not look that pretty by today's standards.  What changed in Myst compared to other games is that you were told absolutely nothing and given no direction whatsoever.  This is all about exploration and figuring out what the world expects of you.  Now, this can make it extremely difficult if you are not able to catch the little clues hidden throughout the world of Myst, or this can make it really feel like an adventure as you search every nook and cranny for the clues needed to pass each puzzle throughout the world of Myst.  There are different islands to go to which offer different environments and a variety of puzzles.  The world itself can feel very lonely at times since the only characters you will see are typically embedded in books where finding pages throughout the world will help reveal more of the story.  However, the story is very short and succinct compared the long list of puzzles that you will go through.  A classic in its time.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												A frame-for-frame remake of Myst that doesn't lose any of the charm or mystery that launched the franchise. The puzzles are still quite tricky (probably moreso for today's generation of gamers) and the exploration aspect is just as we all remember it. It's probably not the most objectively engaging adventure game of all time but it's definitely worth the revisit for those who loved the original. Does it stand up against modern games of this genre? Well yes, because there are no modern games of this genre.			",121,22,7,16,15,0,25

												Just a heads up: If you have a computer that is NOT from the 90's, be prepared to do a bit of Google searching and troubleshooting to get the game to work correctly.  You will probably have to run in compatibility mode to get the videos to play, and the wrong settings may cause frequent crashes.That being said, Myst is a fantastic game.  Very well made for its time.  The puzzles are the perfect difficulty: fairly challenging, but never so hard to make you give up.  (Although if you get stuck, you can click the bottom of the screen for hints.)  The world is interesting and the plot is unique.  Basically, there is a reason that this game is among the top 10 best selling PC games of all time.  Myst is a classic, although you probably already knew that.			",438,144,9,40,30,2,66

They don't have to like it, or even finish it, but just to play through and see how gaming was back in the early 90s. The stills are still(hah) pretty good-looking, and it's a strange, quirky island with a lot of detail and depth. 9/10..Unfortunately there are massive issues with this version of the game on Steam and newer OSes.

DON'T do any of that, you will not see any of the cutscens, including the books. Beyond that, it's Myst. If you don't know what Myst is, then welcome to PC gaming. Myst is one of the games that defined PC gaming in the 90s. If you have a brain, play it. If you don't have a brain, play it, cause you might grow one. Immerse yourself in the world and just enjoy.

The atmosphere and sense of discovery make for a amazing adventure that make you feel like you are there.  The Masterpiece Edition, is an updater version of the game that uses the higher, uncompressed 24-bit truecolor images, which is a noticeable improvement over the games previous 8-bit images.  While the game is showing its age and has some compatibility issues with Windows 7, it is still an astonishing game, one that I always love coming back to.I highly recommend Myst to anyone who loves puzzles, and even if you don't..

												Just completed... this game scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me as a child, so glad to have conquered it finally.Hints in this version help, but sometimes they didn't come up and other times they came up even when you didn't ask for them. Most of them were good that it didn't tell you everything, but it did ruin one part which I think I would have got to on my own without them. Seems the compatibility settings mess it up.Got it to work sort of well on my windows 10 64-bit laptop. I had Quicktime 7.7.4 installed from itunes or something, so I didn't have to install quicktime 4 like other people mention. In the end the most stable compatibility settings was disable display scaling and admin rights. I don't know if these were even required. I had a lot of random crashes initially, and ended up playing most of the game in ""Windows 98/ME"" mode. That seemed to be the most stable, until I got to the Mechanical Age and there is this tower rotation simulator that sounds like a radio in the war room. When I tried that it would crash and disabling the ""Windows 98/ME"" mode seemed to work. It still random crashed, but didn't bother me as I got use to saving when I made major progress and I was keeping notes, so I never really lost that much progress. I haven't played realmyst, but I enjoyed the slideshow behaviour of the original. Like in the Channelwood age it is really easy to get dis-orientated so I had to keep notes. I don't know if that would happen so much if you have full control like realmyst. Realmyst basic version seemed to have its own compatibility issues anyway.			",3,3,4,1,0,0,1

												It may have been a decent revamp of the game at the time, but it's terrible now.  It solves none of the vast compatibility problems you're faced with in getting the original game to work, and I was not able to discern any graphical improvements.  (I had been under the impression that the graphical update was the entire purpose of this version of the game).If you have an XP box sitting around somewhere, you might be able to get it to run on that.  Anything newer and you'll face monumental problems in getting it to work.  (Of particular note is the need for an ancient version of QuickTime that Steam failed to package with the game (it handles DirectX and .NET and uPlay, so it seems reasonable to expect) - I've heard both 6.5 and 4 referenced; I think I was able to get the original game running with 2 point something.  OldVersion.com is where you'll want to be going to handle this part of the compatibility issues.)It's a pity.  The original game is quite the excellent puzzle game, and Masterpiece Edition really sounded like the most faithful remake option.  (Free-roam exploration has its place.  Uru and Myst 5 did an excellent job in demonstrating that place is NOT in Myst games.)   And yet, despite that bias, I'd have to suggest anyone wanting to play the original Myst (who isn't an old hand at wrestling with major compatibility issues or a collector of old computers) should go for realMyst.  Unlike the sequels (particularly Riven), the stuff you'll need to find isn't so much hidden as walled off by puzzle-barriers, so you won't have to worry about missing important factors in the background details because you have nothing indicating that a particular area is worth taking note of.  (There's a couple things in Riven I'd never have found in free-roam - they show up because you're forced to look at it from a fixed perspective...kinda like that sidewalk art that looks entirely 3D if you stand in just the right spot.)

It seems they fixed it!I bought the steam version of Myst, like, a year ago and wrote a negative review because it honoured me with countless crashes and nonexistent intros. A common problem.Now that I redownloaded it, it works nicely. The intro was there and when I quickly went to a section that used to make it crash (clocktower), it was stable. (on Win10 64bit)Sooo... if you want to play a classic, mysterious, pathbreaking point'n'click game from the 90s, it should be a safe buy now. (note that most of the negative reviews stem from the instability of the previous, non-fixed version, not from the quality of the game itself)			",88,36,2,5,6,0,1

												This is, as the package calls itself, a masterpiece.  You are alone, stranded, and in a land very alien to you.  All that you know is that you touched a book that shouldn't have been where it was.  Many questions are asked, but the truths to them all are nowhere in sight.  Time to do a little digging.  Behold: old tales of betrayal and mystery, old worlds once cherished, old questions that neither were nor will be answered, and an old game which brought these elements into an everlasting perfect union.

												It runs perfectly fine on my computer with Windows 8.1.  Its a veeeerry challenging game but it would probably be best not to go to walkthroughs unless you really need to because that could take away from the fun of the game.  Ive never been much of a PC gamer so its not really nostalgic for me but I do like the simplistic yet addicting feel to it.  It is most definitely worth $6.00.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I wasn't able to change the combatibility of the game in windows ( I'm running 7 ) because the game isnt actually downloaded to the desktop through steam.

Not for the impatient or the easily frustrated, some of the puzzles are quite difficult, but they always make perfect sense in some way once you grasp what's happening.I did need to fiddle around with compatibility settings, as initially the game kept crashing on me.

												Myst is one of those games that you spent hours as a child on your Windows 95 trying to solve the crazy amount of puzzles. I must have spents countless hours with my brothers and I recall actually beating the game. While it hasn't aged well and the gameplay is vague, it still has one of the most interesting stories that pulls you in. Trying to play the game again though, well, I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't imagine trying to get past all the ridiculously mind boggling puzzles or trying to read several guides again. I clicked my way through the island for a bit and it did bring back some nostalgia, but it also brought back some severe head scratching moments, like, ""How the ♥♥♥♥ did I manage this at 8 years old?""While it's a great game for people that have never played it, it really is nerve wrecking and will just make you mad.10/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												I bought this game to introduce my children to the Adventure game genre, and it didn't disappoint! It's an immersive game with puzzles that are intuitive enough for a young child to solve yet still challenging enough not to bore an adult. The only problem is that it may take a bit of effort to get the right settings for the game to run properly on a newer OS, and even then you may encounter a glitch or two - but it's worth the trouble if you are determined to play this classic game. If you really don't have the patience to downgrade Quicktime and run through visual and audio settings however, I suggest you save yourself the trouble and just play something newer.

Unofrtunately it is old and doesn't run perfectly. That said, I have Windows 7 and ran Myst in compatibility mode on Windows 98 and the only issue was saving and loading took a while and seemed like it was crashing, but after about a minute the game would return to normal. Overall this is one of my new favorite games and I would recommend that everybody try it out.			",80,16,0,15,10,0,8

												To explain this game to someone is kind've weird. It's a puzzle game with a deep story which you can easily get invested in but when you tell people it's about books they turn their heads and question you. Or in the worst case they'll say something stupid without letting you finish like ""Pfft. Nerd."" The story in question (free of spoilers) is about some random bloke finding the book fo ""Myst"" which when read takes this unknown person to the island of Myst. Upon entering Myst you get adventurous and creepy vibes about the island and it's good fun when you finally discover the answer to certain puzzles. A puzzle in itself is actually getting the game to work functionally. Depending on what Operating System you the compatibility can be completely random. Crashes can be frequent for some and I've heard of some people having visual glitches. Luckily for me on my Windows 10 PC I did not have many problems except for one specific certain area crash which could easily be fixed. The big fix to this is buying the remake: realMyst: Masterpiece Edition but the compatibility issues are not as bad as I've made them seem so you could just live with this version.

												A simple premise, that becomes a mind bending but beautiful Adventure Puzzle game. You're a man who somehow, falling through a book, end up on the Island of Myst. No one is around, and theres nothing but a note sitting on the ground waiting for you. From here on you have to figure out the next place you need to go, and do, all with your own wits. The game is difficult, but the beautiful scenery and the feeling of being totally alone keeps you playing. Game-wise, this version of the game is a sort of railed adventure game. That rail deviates and splits hundreds of times, but it keeps you from wandering off into the forest with no reason. Those who dislike that, there is another version entitled ""Real Myst"" which removes that rail and allows for free movement.Graphic wise, I believe this game stands up even today.

												Myst is a point and click puzzle-game, where you explore the Myst island and four different ""Ages"", and collect lost pages. To get into these Ages, you need to solve puzzles. To get back to the Myst island, you need to solve puzzles. Graphics are rather old and it shows, but combined with ambient sounds and music, I find the atmosphere quite engrossing even after all these years.The game itself is excellent, yet since it is VERY old, it may not even be possible to play this on your setup. I would dearly suggest NOT to buy THIS one, but rather trying something like realMyst: Masterpiece Edition, which is far more recent version of the game.			",135,54,5,40,24,3,53

												Incredible game marred by a myriad of technical issues. Even after I got it working with Windows 7, it crashed every few minutes and would occassionaly refuse to load at all. This version should not be for sale on Steam because it is nearly unplayable.			",82,43,1,19,6,0,3

												♥♥♥♥ the piano puzzle in this game in which all five sliders are hypersensitive and I've counted and recounted each slider over a hundred times and my solutions are never accepted. Even after turning mouse sensitivity down and double checking with multiple walkthroughs to make sure I was doing it right (I was), this♥♥♥♥♥♥still doesn't let me through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Complete WASTE OF MONEY. Heard so much about Myst and wanted to experience it. This game should not be this hard to run!!! Windows 8 / i7 core Geforce gtx 765m Game lags like crazy, would not load animations till set on run as win98, now video runs but game crashes constantly. DON'T WASTE THE MONEY! Buy a newer game.

												Bought All the myst games, now they have a glitch, Steam says bcs I played over 2hrs am not up for refund of ANY kind, although it can take MONTHS of playing to uncover the entire story, so you wouldnt find all the glitches anyways. This version as well as the other ones, of the main first Myst game, do not work. I can only play for 10 mins, trigger the puzzle in the lighthouse and this freezes my entire computer. Have to hard boot it. This is a new Asus ROG too, not a cheap computer, but steam.. I will NEVER buy another game. Your digital copy gets errors and you refuze to replace w a new program  ?~!!?!?!  HORRID AND A RIP OFF> REPORTING YOU TO THE BBB !!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game. Oh. My Dog. Yes.I first played this game when I was 5 on my dad's computer, so admittedly there's some nostalgia bias here. But I've played it many times since then, and it really is fantastic. It's old as balls in computer game years, but it holds up.This is the type of puzzle game that takes some commitment from the player - you'd better have a notebook handy to write down all the clues and hints along the way, because the game does not make things easy for you. Full disclosure, I still haven't beaten the game because I always get stuck on one particular puzzle. Every year or so I make another attempt, hopefully this will be the year. That said, the challenge is what makes the game worth it; many puzzle games nowadays are way too easy, and it gets boring. If Myst gets boring, it's because you're stuck and you may need to take a break, think about it, and have another crack at it later.Biggest complaint is that it's a little awkward running on modern OS's; I was able to get this running on Windows 8.1 with (so far) no issues, but it can be a little clunky on some people's systems. Make sure you have Quicktime installed, and check the Steam forums for good compatibility settings.			",54,9,0,8,3,0,4
