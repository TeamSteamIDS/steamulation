Blackwell Unbound is the second installment of Blackwell series, and it is a prequel to the first game. Here, we take the chance of experiencing the previous generation of the Legacy, with Lauren Blackwell. I have to say that the previous game left me with such great expectations, I rushed to play this one and first, was quite confused not the find Rosa. The city, the time, even Joey's attitude was different. Then I realized that finding Lauren instead, was a welcoming surprise in the end.In this game we play as Lauren Blackwell, Rosa's witty and daring aunt back in 1970s. She is a chain smoker, a lady with an attitude and she has the guts that Rosa lacked in the previous game. She takes the day as it comes, and doesn't rest until a case is closed. Alongside Joey - the famous legacy himself - they investigate many potential cases and guide restless spirits to their after lives. In this specific period of their partnership however, they shall meet a strange old lady and end up witnessing a darker shade of what being a medium actually means.This game is a bit grim in tone compared to the Blackwell Legacy. Dialogues carry sharp, two sided meanings, heavy with bittersweet feelings and a burdening suspense. The nature of the cases, and their resulting situation reveals a darker, shadier side to the medium business. Since we already know how Lauren's story will end eventually, seeing her venturing further down into her end is somehow heartbreaking.Lauren is a strong character, as I briefly described before. She is so driven and so courageous, she ends up being downright suicidal sometimes. Her relationship with Joey is completely different whence compared to Rosa's relationship. We experience the advantage that Lauren and Joey already knew each other for a long time. So there is no awkwardness in their relationship. There is no ""Oh no, ghosts are real?"" period. I wondered if there would even be a little romance between them! I personally think this was a great opportunity to discover further background and in-depth personality to Joey and Lauren Blackwell.The gameplay is nearly the same as before, yet the loveliest addition to the game is that Joey has become a playable character now. You are welcome to send him through walls or use his perception to check on the environment to catch a small nuance that may help you to progress in the case. I have to add that the voice acting was remarkably improved compared to the first game also. Alongside the commentary feature which we are already familiar with, you can enjoy some backdrop jokes, concept arts and various unused recordings when you finish the game.All in all, I liked this one and now I feel more attracted to the Blackwell series altogether, witnessing Lauren and Joey in their time. Whence you look up on a family tree and compare the generations, it is not possible not to connect yourself better with given history. I cannot wait to play the third part and see what Rosa has been up to!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												This is a great prequel to Legacy. All of the investigation flows really smoothly and I only consulted a walkthrough for one minor thing that I missed. Really satisfying.			",680,270,14,90,52,8,108

												Perhaps The Blackwell Unbound’s biggest contribution to the series, is giving it a far larger scope and nuance than what was only hinted at in the first game.Long before Rosa Blackwell ever met Joey Mallone (or had even been born for that matter), Unbound follows her aunt, Lauren, Joey’s previous “hostage” and an experienced medium at the point we find her. Unbound isn’t so much about her adventures with Joey though, as it is a foreshadowing of what we already know happens to her.In many ways she’s the spitting image of her niece, though certainly more confident and assertive than the depressed Rosa we met in Legacy, yet tied by the common thread of having largely given up on the world. Lauren has devoted herself to helping lingering ghosts move on to the afterlife, but otherwise is unsure for what purpose she’s living for. Or at least that’s what she tells herself, but when caught up in an investigation she becomes a wholly different person.Lauren is persistent and dedicated to doing whatever is necessary to finish a case, no matter if it means pressing people for information they’d rather forget, or putting her life on the line to catch a killer. Maybe it’s because she feels she has no other purpose that she’s able to so readily move forward, unafraid of how dangerous it could become. By abandoning her worry she’s able to fully embody her role as a medium, as if she too was a ghost and nothing could harm her. She’s a refreshingly capable heroine in a landscape of unstable sex objects, who manages to be tough without losing her humanity. There’s the feeling she’s still scared underneath her fearless exterior, and allows herself to become vulnerable at times to avoid a complete breakdown, but she’s always in control of any situation she puts herself in whether interrogating a witness or firing back when Joey gets brash.It’s in the final moments of Unbound though that are the most affecting. We’ve already been told what eventually happens to Lauren in Legacy, but it’s seeing it and hearing Joey’s ignorant condolences that made me almost angry at what his presence has done and continues to do to the Blackwells. It casts Lauren and Rosa’s relationship with him in a different light and made me question his every word, now unsure if I could trust him the way I was, wondering if he had a more nefarious purpose for being there all along. Much of Unbound feels inessential, like another episode in a show you enjoy but could afford to miss, but its implications on the larger whole of the Blackwell saga is perhaps the most significant bit of exposition in the series thus far. Suddenly things have become a hell of a lot more complicated.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. ",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

Short Verdict: Blackwell Unbound is the second installment in my favorite point-and-click adventure series in this century. The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. BU tells the story of Lauren Blackwell, a medium, and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in the 70's, if I'm not mistaken, and investigating cases related to ghosts who have problems moving on to the afterlife. It's definitely better than The Blackwell Legacy, but the sequels are even better. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! I had played it a few years ago and it was still fun to replay it now. Don't forget to play The Blackwell Legacy first! While you could play BU as a standalone game, you'll miss a little bit if you haven't played TBL.Pros: Despite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable The story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun The puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either The dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough. And this game has no problems with different volumes like its prequel. Has a very interesting mechanic in which you combine clues instead of items to solve puzzles, and that works really well with the investigation theme This time you get to control both Lauren and Joey, adding a lot to the puzzles Beautiful retro graphics BGM is awesome, way better than the already good tunes from TBLCons: Sometimes the audio played doesn't match the text written The low resolution annoys me a bit (you can set it to 1280x960, though, but that option is hard to find) While the game itself is a lot more polished than its prequel, they didn't take the time to properly proofread the dialogues, especially the ones with a character named C.Bought on: PC and Android Bundle 11 by Humble Bundle for an average of US$ 0.55 (roughly R$ 1,46). It's also totally worth its full price, which isn't high at all!			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

 “BOO! Oh, look. I scared it to death. Wait. No. Hold on. It was already like that.” Blackwell Unbound represents the second of five parts in the Blackwell series. On its own it is a prequel dealing with the past of the first game. Compared with its predecessor it has a better balance between gameplay and storytelling. Other strong points are the mature characters and their witty dialogues. In addition the puzzles are more logical and the voice acting remains top notch. While the main story is not as strong as in Blackwell Legacy, the underlying storyline profits from this flashback.  Trivia: The storyline of Blackwell Unbound was originally a part of Blackwell Convergence, but due to budget issues it was decided to release the game content as a stand-alone.

												After playing the Blackwell Legacy, I was totally amazed with its storytelling regardless of its somewhat simple graphics. The game certainly took me by surprised and when I saw the next game in this saga, Blackwell Unbound, I didn’t want to play it as I thought it couldn’t live up to its standards. Well I simply caved in and installed the game. Once completed, this one moved me more than the first (Blackwell Legacy) with even better character development. There were also slightly more technical improvements however the puzzle elements were the same; that is wasn’t challenging enough and lack thereof.Blackwell Unbound takes place in 1973, meaning it served as a prequel to Legacy. The game assumes the player’s knowledge of the main character Joey and introduces a new one, Lauren. Lauren is the aunt for Rosa from Legacy and her demeanour is considerably different as Lauren is more confident in her abilities as a medium. Then again, it didn’t explain at all of how Lauren was introduced to Joey in the first place. Nevertheless it’s a refreshing outlook of Lauren’s more assertive personality considering she is a chain smoker from hell. I guess that’s the 70s for ya.The gameplay is in the style of a point and click variety – that is you literally just do that, point at a hotspot like an item or person and it will interact. Right click the mouse for the character to analyse and left click to interact. There is some inventory management where only Lauren can access (as after all, Joey is a ghost) and the neat notebook feature is here again. What this feature does, once it gets an update prompt, you can join sentences together to form another. Yet to those who’d played Legacy, there’s a new feature where you get to control both Joey and Lauren individually. This is pretty neat considering some puzzles requires swapping between characters.Speaking of which, there are only a handful of puzzles to solve yet thankfully, they are all logical so they are no mind-bending at all. For some, this maybe a put-off however the plotline and game’s pacing hits the spot as there’s momentum instead of having a difficult puzzle to bottleneck the tempo. Also the storyline is so well written with realistic problems that’s very welcoming. The general mood is sombre yet well fitted for the plotline.Thankfully to enhance the sombre mood, the musical scores by Thomas Regin is nothing short but exceptional. All the scores are well suited for this game and has that jazz feel. Not overdone however very welcoming and professionally composed. It’s that good I purchased the soundtrack in iTunes for USD $10. Graphically it is powered by the Adventure Game Studio (AGS), graphic artist Erin Robinson made some alterations, mainly with the characters and done a wonderful job at it. They are all dressed up as if it was the 70s and there’s little to be said about pixel hunting. Yet the opening screen where is shows the Statue of Liberty overlooking the Manhattan skyline at night is lovely to see.It’s pretty rare that an adventure game sucks me in as well as Unbound did. The game’s length, depending upon your detective skills I guess, could take around the five hours mark. However I really cannot let go of this game until completion as mentioned before, the game’s pacing and storytelling is simply fantastic. Granted there’s a couple of bugs where the written text and spoken words differ and at one occasion, the text is there however the voice is muted however, and thankfully so, didn’t ruin the game. There’s obvious love and care poured into this game and the game’s ending, as much as I did actually panic, feels like I need to perform a standing ovation! A definite must play.8 / 10			",729,439,34,169,129,5,186

												Not the biggest fan of the games of this series. While they are alright bite-sized adventure games I never really liked the characters very much (other then Joey). The puzzles were alright and the dialog...decent but I never got hooked on the story as a whole. Think this might be in the better half of the Blackwell games but as I cant really recommend any of the games seperatly as you should play all four as a whole you'd have to experience everything no matter what.Has some tricky achievements that will require some extra focus (especially the smoking achievements). If you dont plan ahead during your first playthrough or use savefiles in a clever way you will need to beat the game twice. Also make sure, like all Blackwell games, to turn on the commentary track during your first playthrough.Time to 100%:  ~3-5 hours			",942,372,36,86,96,14,164

												The second game in the Blackwell series is a prequel, and involves a very important character mentioned in the first game. It is shorter, and the plot is not as gripping as Blackwell Legacy. However, there's some fun puzzles and introduces a new way to find information and solve puzzles which was not possible before. The writing is solid, and the voice acting is really great as it was in the first game.			",126,102,0,62,6,1,13

												Blackwell Legacy & UnboundBackground: Love Point & clicks. Stumbled across this as a reddit recommend during the summer sale. Played  shortly after Perfidious Petrol Station (similar style game) so was in the mood for retro gaming. Reviewing both the first and second game as they are very similar and i played them back to back.Impressions: Anyone whose played the first two Blackwell games will point to their lo-fi charm.. Blackwell  captures the days of SCUMM/Lucasarts perfectly... all too perfectly with it's qwerks, dead-ends, glitches and clunky interface. But as ever it's the story and characters that need to stand-out and within 5minutes I was hooked on the plot and invested in the characters.The Good:* Superb story in a world that feels lived in.* Original gameplay ideas that are fun to explore.* Great characters and cases that make logical sense.* The Notepad mechanic is genius.* Recaptures the days of Monkey Island.* Achievements make replay more fun.* Commentary is fun and enlightening.The Bad:* Voice acting can be a little off (part of the charm).* Can get deadended because you missed clicking one thing.* Save/Load interface is awkward.* Can't ALT+TAB on Win 7 without locking up and CTRL+DEL.* Some visuals are stretched by widescreen monitors.* Some lines unvoiced or used in error (very few).* Commentary is spoliery don't listen on first play-through.* Short length but value when bought as a pack.* Bonus features has audio swearing not in the main game.Recommended for: Old school P n' C fans who value plot and characters over glitz. Ideal for nostalgia hounds and teens who like the supernatural.Conclusion.7/10. It won't blow you away but it's a solid set of games and deserves to be played.			",683,273,20,84,61,7,96

												Blackwell Unbound is one of the first few point-and-clicks that I genuinely liked. The game focuses on the story and character interaction so I found that I didn't have to think too much in order to progress through the game. I just found myself getting into all the conversations with the various personalities.At certain points of the game, I found myself wanting to know more about certain characters. It's a bit unfortunate that the scope of what you discover isn't as broad as what it could be but then again, that kind of information can derail from this type of game's main focus.My only real gripe with the game is how Lauren keeps flicking her cigarette all over the place when her apartment has like 3 ashtrays and an ashpail outside. You would think she'd use one of them.			",1696,736,69,252,221,20,307

												This installment of the Blackwell series is a prequel, you take control of Lauren Blackwell (Rosa's aunt) and Joey!This game was a bit shorter than Legacy, most likely because there were fewer places to go and less items to pick up.However, don't let the length of this entry deter you, it's just as good as Legacy. I liked the dynamic and dialogue between Lauren and Joey; and it was also a fun and unique twist to be given the ability to play as Joey. As Joey, he not only speaks to other spirits but he can also go through walls and inspect areas/items and make observations that helps with the investigation. I also appreciated the extended explanation (albeit brief) of how spirits and mediums work, I had worried that that part of the Blackwell story would be left out. The one complaint I have, although minor, is the fact that you are only able to access the bonus galleries after the credits roll. I had to save my game as soon as the credits finished rolling in order to have infinite access - by loading my save file.So, I hope that feature has been improved upon in the later installments.

												Second game of the Blackwell saga, and actually a prequel to The Blackwell Legacy, The Blackwell Unbound is one charming point and click adventure. Featuring Lauren Blackwell, Rosa's aunt, the game is full of little details that will help us understand that part of Lauren's past we just had a glimpse of in the first game, and her connection with Joey. New York in the seventies is so freaking cool in this game, and so are the strange and funny characters (and ghosts) that Lauren and Joey will find on their journey.As always with the Balckwell games we're not talking about a game hard to beat, the puzzles are pretty easy, but even if I don't like it very much I'm inclined to think that it is a specific design choice to make the story flow freely at any time. The narrative aspect of the Blackwell games is prominent, the story is very well written and it always feels that the player can identify with the characters and some of their problems, and choices. Plus, Joey. Joey's awesome. So, essentially, the Blackwell Unbound is a good game ""per se"", a very cool second chapter of the saga, and a great prequel.			",165,160,2,24,6,1,14

OverviewThe 2nd title in the Blackwell series, Unbound is a prequel to the 1st Blackwell game, Legacy. You play as Rosa's aunt and predecessor, Lauren. Game mechanics are pretty similar to Legacy, with the notebook still in use. You get to control both Lauren and Joey. Unbound features 2 cases to solve, and contains several easter eggs and some interesting Steam achievements.Likes Story - More content here compared to Legacy. Characters - At first I worried I wouldn't like a chain-smoking protagonist, but it all turned out fine. The spooks were also fairly interesting, especially the female one. Setting - This takes place in the '70s; the retro vibe was successfully conveyed. Ability to play as Joey - This gave the game some variation. Music - You can never go wrong with smooth jazz. And a piano. Graphics - Like those classic old-school Sierra games; my type of nostalgia. Voice acting - Lauren does ""jaded and bitter"" really well. I really liked the female spook too. Easter eggs! - Just like the good ol' days. One involves a floating head! Steam achievements - I didn't bother getting them all, but if you do that'll glean you maybe an hour or more of gameplay.Dislikes Length - Still too short for my liking. Say 2 hours at most. Too few locations - You backtrack a lot and have to visit the same places over and over. There aren't many scenes to explore. It gets a bit tiresome after a while. A bit one-dimensional - I was hoping for a bit more intrigue plot-wise. Things are too straightforward and spelled too plainly for the player.SummaryUnbound for me was a definite improvement over Legacy in terms of game length and story breadth, and as you can see from above, there were many other things I liked about it. However the plot was all too clear-cut and lacked mystique and finesse, and game length left much to be desired. As a standalone game I would not pay more than US$2 for this.

												After the first Blackwell game I was hooked on the story, but had things I wished future entries would improve on. I'm glad to say the second game was just the kind of leap forward in quality I was hoping for. The music was borderline inappropriate in the first game, and here in the second game it's just perfect. The art is better, the game is more stable, and the puzzle designs are more ambitious, without turning into a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Like the first game it’s short and easy, which is perfectly fine for the story it’s trying to tell. I had a great time with it.			",277,51,9,27,7,0,6

												The Blackwell series is a very very good point and click adventure with pretty good voice acting.You need to play them all to really feel the story and the depth of the characters. The Finale(Epiphany) was FANTASTIC(you may shed a tear). Its one of those games where the toil of playing all those hours actually felt meaningful in the end. The Voice acting was satisfying enough to make you forget its actually a point and click game.Some solutions to some puzzles may not be that obvious at first, but if you dont get it,plenty of guides there.Since almost all the blackwell games have similar mechanics, didnt think of writing different reviews for each of them. 9/10 for the series. Writing this after playing all the 5 episodes.Kudos to Dave Gilbert and The whole Team.			",137,70,0,11,10,3,1

												Blackwell Unbound is far superior to the original Blackwell Legacy game in terms of user interface and gameplay. It actually felt like the designer put a good amount of effort into fixing many of the deficiencies with the first game. Although this one goes backward in time and is a prequel to the first game. It is possible to play Unbound stand-alone without getting lost from missing out on the first story. Unlike the first game there is actually a sense of closure with the ending.

												(THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE)While I could tell you about the cute pixel art, atmospheric music or mysterious story, all of which are great, they are also things which I kind of expected to be great from a point and click adventure game.What I didn't expect is the direction the game took with actual gameplay and problem solving. Forget L.A. Noire, this game makes you feel like a true detective. This can be kind of said about all of the Blackwell series games, but for some reason I felt like it shone the most in this one. (maybe its the chain smoking of the main character)First of all, important events get written down in your notebook, but instead of your character reaching conclusions on their own, you have to actually connect important notes yourself, to either make educated guesses, figure out if characters are lying or just notice that two cases might be connected. I have never seen such mechanic in a point and click adventure game before. Some people felt like it was annoying so they took it out in the next game, but it has since made a return in the fourth.Something which they have improved from the first game is the way you do research. In that game, you would use your clues in the notebook to research things, which meant that it would sometimes come down to you trying all the options to progress. In this one however, you need to actually type in the thing you want to search for, which means that you actually have to notice clues in things like letters, photos or the enviroment, which the playable characters won't even mention. This is actually the first time a game made me draw a mindmap on a piece of paper to note down all the suspicions I had and important figures and their interactions with oneanother.Another addition from the first game is having control over your little ghost partner, this leads to some clever puzzle solutions where you have to send him to scout out areas which you don't have access to, or create distractions for you to take advantage of, something which has since been much refined in the later games.The only issue I had with the game stems from it being made out of material cut from the next game Blackwell Convergence. You see all of this game was originally supposed to be a flashback in the next game. While this hasn't hurt the games length, it does kind of create a problem with the order youre supposed to play the games in. If you play this before Convergence, it will kind of....ruin the mystery a bit (I'm trying not to spoil anything). Whereas if you play Convergence first and then this one, you will already know how everything will play out. Best way would be to play Convergence up to a certain point, then switch to this, then switch back, and so on, and so on. But the issue with this is that you won't know the moments when to switch without knowing the whole story, so you would need someone to tell you when to switch, and I can't really write the moments when to switch here, because the moments themselves would be a spoiler.....It might be just something bugging me personally, and it definitely doesn't hurt the game as a whole.

												Blackwell Unbound is the second game in the Blackwell series: you'll play as Lauren, Rose's aunt, and will need to solve two ghost cases that seem to be connected to an actual living killer. Joey will once again be at your side as your spirit guide and, this time, you'll be able to switch control between the two characters.PROS:-good story with two fairly interesting investigations and a decent ending-Lauren is a strong, no-nonsense and slightly depressed lead and a quite interesting character. Joey is back with his snarky remarks and shows quite a bit of affection towards her-controlling Joey is fun and makes puzzles more interesting to solve-fully voice acted, the voice acting is also better than what it was in Legacy-the jazz soundtrack is great and gives a good 70s vibe-good amount of nicely designed puzzles-once again there's a commentary track giving you interesting info on the gameCONS:-some voices are a bit poor, there's also some instances where you can clearly hear distortions or sounds coming from the microphone used to record the voice actor-short at around one hour and a half to complete-graphics are a tad too simple-if you don't play the games in order there's no explanation on who you are, why Joey is following you or anything else story related

Blackwell Unbound acts as a prequel to Legacy and does a decent job at giving us a glimpse of who Laures was as a person and what kind of relationship she had with Joey: some elements, like the puzzle design and voice acting, have improved quite a bit while others, graphics and an ending that's perhaps a bit rushed, have somewhat declined but overall this is a pretty good game.There's no denying that this is a well-written story and that the two cases are engaging enough to keep your interest up till the end so despite production values that might feel a bit low at times Blackwell Unbound is an easy recommendation for adventure fans, just be sure to play Legacy first.

												Blackwell Unbound is a second game in a Blackwell franchise, being yet another point-n-click adventure with pixel-art yet modern approach. This one is actually a budget prequel, starring Rosa's auntie and jazzy setting of older New York.The engine is quite old, but trusty and should work just fine, despite sometime being weird about using anti-aliasing over the pixel-art. Mostly when characters sprites are being scaled. It has a weird thing where all dialogue would be insta-skipped after pressing Shift+Tab, commonly used for Steam overlay. Pressing Tab will fix it.As you can see, this game is a prequel, starring Lauern, Rosa's auntie along with Joey the sidekick ghost in older New York. And as you can actually see, it feels like a prequel with more of budget animation, the pixel-art isn't more simple and isn't as amazing. Still does job done. The odd thing that annoyes me is talking animation, for some reason everybody bobs whole head down upon opening mouth. The music is heavely using jazz in pretty much anything, which gives a special atmosphere to game's setting, but I like it less than in the first game.And yes, it's a modern point-n-click, with no deaths or dead ends. This time puzzles are a little better, though some notebook combinations don't make perfect sense. A good innovation is ability to switch between two character, though Joey doesn't have as much of use. Still makes it more like a team.The plot starts dynamically right off the bad, unlike the first game where half of the game was you wandering around aimlessly. Here you got two seemingly unrelated cases. Yes, investigating in same time and deciding which clues belong to which one. Doesn't have big plot motivation to push you forward though. The plot also sets things going for the third game, so you shouldn't miss this game either.Lauern is also more of mature character than Rosa, and the way that two main heroes interact with each other, with ability to chit chat, is quite fun. With unique part of being a heavy smoker.Achievements are quite usual, and there are two that are related to amount of times Lauren smoked through the game... So in one walkthrough you wil spend some time watching her picking on cigarrete and another one you better be speedrunning. Aha.And yes, game once again delivers on extra content. The commentaries mode is still there and this has drawing artist speaking sometimes too. Game designer's commentaries are there too and once again he mostly speaks about his experience with voice acting.And once you beat a game, while abusing people by doing photographs, you will unlock other extra content, including voice acting bloober and now also having a collection of early versions of music and even concept art for the third, upcoming by then, game in the series. No worries, pixel art is different in final version of the third game, will not spoil too hard.So yes, another solid entry in the series. Sets things up for the third game and is good enough to be stand-alone. Favourite among fans and developers, despite being more of budget title. Check it out.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												Rosangela Blackwell is a struggling author living in New York, and a medium. Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to ""the other side"" throughout the series. In BLACKWELL UNBOUND, the player is taken back to the 1970s. Here you get a glimpse of how Lauren Blackwell (Rosa's aunt) and Joey Mallone, a ghost/spirit guide, lived and worked together.  The focus in this installment is on two separate murders whose ghosts are trapped in the physical world.  Without revealing too much, Lauren and Joey come to find that both people were murdered by the same person, who is completely insane. This insane person will appear again, although in a different form, in the remaining installments.  Originally, 'UNBOUND' was supposed to be a flashback sequence within the next installment, 'CONVERGENCE.'  However, it became so large that it became a game in its own right. Note: UNBOUND features a real person as a character. Namely, writer Joseph Mitchell of The New Yorker.To enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.

												This is the second game of the series. I liked the first and I figured i'd just play them all.The story as usual is extremely good and this time you play as your Aunt! I noticed a save limit though ( you need to manually delete them from the SteamApps folder... ) Also the most annoying achievement yet, smoking achievements. The resolution hasn't improved, 2 character voices in particular had a weird... Cheap microphone sounding to them at some points in the game...Obviously not everything is bad about it, or I wouldn't recommend it! This one has less backtracking, which is always good! The ''puzzles'' are also alot better than the first one and you really need to use your imagination!Overall, all the Blackwell games are worth playing if you like point-and-clicks! They aren't perfect, but they got one of the best stories i've ever experienced in a game.			",1398,507,40,151,122,22,188

												This is my favorite game of the series. Why? Because of the setting. Their portrayal of 1973 life was accurate enough to make me nostalgic. Although I was a baby in the 70's, enough of it carried over into the early 80's that was when my first memories were forming. Things that are to become relics or already have, like wired phones, telephone books! (these were Google before the internet), cold calls, smoking everywhere, tube tvs, transistor radios, were all nice details that breathed life into the game. Thanks Wadjet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this sequel to the previous Blackwell: Legacy, the narrative switches over to Rosangela's aunt and predecessor, Lauren. Lauren and her spirit guide, Joey, have been working together for some time by the start of this game and so the introductions and surprise of the last game have been replaced with an easy rapport. The transition of protagonist could have been disruptive, but considering the previous game ends on the question of Lauren's life and career, the chance to learn more about her was a welcome one. By making a full game of the answer instead of gaining this information through flashback or exposition (either from lost letters or Joey himself), you get a chance to see Lauren and Joey really interact with one another. In fact, moments where Joey has to comfort Lauren or talk her through the problem at hand are a common mechanic used to pause and sort through a twisted, interconnected set of cases. This installment has everything the past one did: retro/pixel graphics, great writing backed by great voice acting, and puzzles that are engaging as well as logical. Most importantly, this installment builds the same need to learn more, to see where this is going, as the last one did. I'm not sure if I'm excited to actually play the next game (I did play this immediately after finishing Legacy), but I am eager to learn more about the Blackwells and their relationship with the spirit world.

If you enjoyed the first game then you will really enjoy this one to gain some insight in the past. The gameplay and story are very much the same as the first game but has more locations to visit and are all connected to one another very well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish (like many others) that Steam gave 'meh' as a review option. I don't want to say 'not recommended' as it's not actively bad, but it's not great either. So I'll just summarise a few of the pros and cons and hopefully that will help you decide whether this game is for you or not. As context, I played Blackwell Legacy immediately before I played this, and I started off liking that, but by the end of the second game I think some of the mechanics are wearing a little thin.Pros- Music much better than Blackwell Legacy (which was pretty irritating and there seemed to be no option to turn it off)- Interesting enough story/concept- Characters OK-ish, writing OK-ish- Good to be able to swap between the main characters this time around- Good to have two cases to solve rather than one this time.Cons- The game is too short for the price and quality. It's being sold on steam as five separate games, but really they are ,pre like episodes and probably should be billed as such- I did not enjoy the graphics. I am a loverof classic point and click games and I realise that's where they were going with the style, but to me it felt they went a little too far back in time. The graphics style just didn't seem to fit.- The vast majority of the game is walking back and forth to the same destinations to talk to the same people to see if you can ask them anything else that will incrementally advance the game. It feels pretty repetitive.- The voice acting and sound quality is terrible. Really terrible. You can hear breathing/distortion from their mics (something I've never before noticed in a game - apart from Blackwell legacy...) and the voices themselves for the most part are cringeworthy, to the point that it felt comedic when it wasn't supposed to. One of the characters almost sounded like the 'Drugs are bad, mmmkay' chap from South Park. There were a few terrible 'old lady' impressions. This game would be improved by not having any voice acting at all. (And it would fit more with the retro point and click vibe to have no in-game speech, so I'm honestly not sure why they included it)In short, I don't honestly think this game is worth the money at full price, it's aleady short and a lot of the game feels like back-and-fort padding. You will probably only enjoy it if you are a die hard fan of the genre (like me!). There are other games which are much better value, all round brilliant point and clicks such as Time Gentlemen Please! or Deponia. If you can pick it up in a sale though it might be worth a look, for the story. ",132,310,1,19,16,2,19

												Blackwell Unbound is a prequel to The Blackwell Legacy. It is a point and click adventure, and sticks to the usual control scheme and playstyle of the genre. In Blackwell Unbound, you play the aunt of the protagonist of Blackwell Legacy. Since this game sort of jumps in to the middle of a relationship between a medium and spirit guide, it is helpful to play the original game first to get some explanation on what is going on. With the help of Joey Malone, a ghost from the 1940's, you must solve mysteries and help lost ghosts find their way to the spirit world. It is a nice shake up of the usual detective story dynamic. While you still must look for clues and interrogate witnesses, you are doing so with the help of a ghost. You can switch from time to time between Lauren and Joey, the ghost, to help you advance. Certain things can only be done by Joey, such as moving through walls or talking to other ghosts in the real world.Blackwell Unbound runs a good bit shorter than The Blackwell Legacy. I really enjoyed the notebook functionality in the first game, but found it a little lacking in this one just due to the overall shortness of the game. This may be because while there is one overarching story, there are two distinct mysteries to solve. The first game just had one mystery that kind of led to another and so on, but the clues really built off each other and involved a lot more using the notebook to combine clues and interrogate witnesses.The graphic style is pretty much unchanged from the first game. It is reminiscent of early 90's adventure games, which in my opinion have aged better than games from the late 90's and early 00's that begin using 3D. They look well enough, but they are really lacking in detail. It's ok to use that style, but I'd like to see it sharpened up a bit with some more detail added overall.The voice acting is much improved, with only small complaints. The main character in particular sounds so much better. She sounds engaged in the story, while her predecessor sounded a little bored. Joey sounds the same, which is neither great nor bad. The main villain sounds pretty terrible in Blackwell Unbound. It really kind of removed me from the story. I think you will understand when you hear it.Overall, I actually enjoyed this more than Blackwell Legacy. While it was a little shorter, and I missed using the notebook as much as the original, I found the overall improvement of the story and voice acting won out. I really like this main character more, although I'm not expecting to see much more of her. I will definitely try out the next game in the series, and recommend you give this game a look.Grade: B+			",776,367,21,112,93,8,122

												Bllackwell Unbound is the second game in the Blackwell adventure series. If you're not familiar with this series, I'd suggest you just start off with the first game, the Blackwell Legacy.Anyway, here we are back in the 1970's as Lauren Blackwell, Rosangela's aunt and her medium predecessor. I have to say this game has a much more involved story line, and it's a wonderful step forward for the series. I really enjoyed the prequel angle, jumping in time and seeing what it is like being a medium from another perspective. Lauren is a more interesting character in my opinion, though I may grow to really like Rosa in the later games.Unbound has a very noir feel to it, it taking place all in one single night. You investigate two deaths, one of a saxophone player and the other of a woman who shut herself in her own apartment for years. These two stories are written quite confidently, and I especially enjoyed the one about the musician. There's something really compelling about investigating the deaths of these characters. You're digging into the past, step by step you learn about people and their issues.But the real highlight was the end. Obviously I won't spoil it for you here, but just know that this game isn't just about two random cases without any more personal connection to Lauren. When the credits rolled, I found myself empathising with her a whole lot, and it really cast a spotlight on Rosangela and the things that lay in wait for her.Blackwell Unbound is an excellent continuation in the series, offers the usual great banter between Joey and the main character, has interesting cases to solve and above all raises the stakes for our heroine(s). A big recommendation from me!			",254,109,3,58,29,4,76

												The sequel to Blackwell Legacy is actually a prequel, but it contributes to the saga in a meaningful way by providing a bit of the backstory. Aesthetically, the game is even simpler and scaled back than the first entry, but this actually improves the ambiance.

												This was terrific, better than the first game. It's still a paranormal noir firmly planted in NYC, but the protagonist in this one is more appealing. She's tougher, more self-assured, and bitter and cynical like a private eye should be. Following up leads in the phone book is a nice oldskool touch. And the music is great. Cigarettes and jazz against a starry night, it doesn't get much more atmospheric. Get it if you liked the first Blackwell. Get if you liked 1954 Alcatraz or A Golden Wake. This is where it's at for modern adventure games.			",65,94,0,3,2,0,3

												It's a bold or possibly insane mind that makes the second episode of a series a flashback, especially after working so hard to establish characters in the previous episode.  And yet, somehow, Blackwell Unbound pulls it off admirably, all while adding some well-considered features and enhancements to the formula of the previous game.To be fair, the characters explored in Unbound aren't completely unrelated.  Returning (or pre-existing) from the previous entry is ghostly sidekick Joey Mallone, this time teamed up with Lauren Blackwell, aunt of the previous game's Rosangela Blackwell.  Much of Lauren's past was shrouded in mystery in the previous game, dialog hinting only vaguely at her life as a medium.  While this game doesn't give you all the answers, or even most of them, it does at least give you a pretty decent glimpse into her life before Rosa.The interface in Unbound is much the same as it was before: your standard Adventure Game interface, but with the added twist of a Notes page that lets you review and combine clues and facts.  Unbound adds another, very welcome feature: the ability to control Joey directly.  Rather than being little more than an object you interact with to complete certain puzzles, you can now float around in Joey's (lack of) shoes.  This makes Joey feel much more like a partner, vital to completing certain puzzles even, rather than a floating bit of comedic relief.Most of this game seems like a huge step forward for the series, despite chronologically being a step backward.  The dialog, the interface, even the ambiance and tone of the game all feel a bit more well developed and thought out.  This is still a short game - episodic and all - but despite the brief time spent in the game's version of 1973 New York you are still left with a very clear image of the city... at least as the game's developer meant to portray it.To be concise, Blackwell Unbound is a short-but-excellent example of the classic point-and-click Adventure game genre, and a worth sequel to the original Blackwell Legacy.  Despite the change in setting it does a good job of carrying the torch, so to speak, and provides an interesting plot complete with entertaining characters and clever-but-not-frustratingly-illogical puzzles.  Another title that anyone who has any love of the genre should feel confident in spending their money on.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

★★★★☆The series' second episode expands on the universe and the characters while fixing some of the predecessor's faultsBlackwell Unbound, the second episode of the Blackwell series, retains all the charm of its predecessor while adding on to it new gameplay mechanics (like searching a phonebook) and fixing some of the more frustrating points of the first game. There's no more bruteforcing required here, just connecting the dots throughout an enticing and satisfying plot. The better soundtrack and better sound quality overall is just icing on the cake. The only flaws I can point is that I thought it was a little too short and the new dialogue boxes, while more minimalistic, make me miss the gorgeous full character art that was present in the first game.In summary, bullet-point style:Pros👍Retains all the charm of the first game, very nice pixel art👍Gripping plot with fleshed-out characters. I hope I see more of Lauren even though I know this is just a prequel.👍Satisfying gameplay that doesn't feel linear, you can switch between the cases you're investigating as you go👍The music is seriously well done, as well as better sound quality and voice acting👍Joey cut back on his snarky toneMehs👉Once again hard to adjust video/audio settings — had to google to find out you can do it through winsetup.exe on the game's folder👉New dialog boxes are more minimalistic, but I miss the portraitsCons👎A bit too short			",635,201,21,72,60,8,96

												Here’s a point and click series that has been eight in years in the making. Fortunately, I did not spend eight years waiting to play them all as I started in early 2014, just in time for the last one to be released. The series aging poorly over a such a long time isn’t really an issue here as it’s done in the 90s style of point and click adventures. Pixel graphics, above-par voice acting, items to pick up and most of all, a compelling story.What do I think? Not bad, not bad at all. The characters draw you into well-written, appropriately voiced, engaging point-and-click adventure. It’s probably one of the most intuitive adventures I’ve played in a while (especially after playing Monkey Island and Sam & Max). It’s also the only point and click adventure I’ve played set in modern times, in the real world. It’s weird to have to think ‘modern’			",256,105,4,31,22,1,39

												The second in the Blackwell series of point-and-click supernatural adventures, prequel to the Blackwell Legacy, where you get to control Lauren and Joey.Unlike some other adventure games the mysteries are largely solved by gathering clues and combining pieces of information, so it's less puzzle-based and more like detective work, with a methodical process and moments of insight, which grounds the experience - yes, one of the main characters is a ghost, but the problem-solving is built on real-world logic, not magic.Another thing I love about the series is the way the relationship between the two main characters develops and matures, and the characters get fleshed out as we learn more about them and their backstories. You can also see the art style and character design mature with each installment.			",152,102,4,15,9,1,34

												I enjoyed this short adventure game, which is the second in a series.  It had a nice story, was relatively short (~2 hours for my first play through), and not too difficult. It seems like older style games I remember, where you make choices from short menus in order to advance the story. But if you miss some important points along the way, you'll have to backtrack a bit to get them before you can advance again. Luckily, the story is rather linear and it didn't look like the game could be put into an unwinnable state, so you can keep trying. And there are some achievements, so there's some replay value here to get them and perhaps see more of or a different aspect of the story. Pretty good game.			",1084,532,46,115,100,10,184

The puzzles and story progression are generally logical. I found I needed to refer to a walkthrough only a few times. If you like adventure games with a good story, I can recommend playing the Blackwell series. Play them in sequence one after the other to get the full effect.

												The Blackwell Series. I'm starting to like these games more and more. I gave the thumbs down to the first game Blackwell Legacy with a question mark, since it wasn't altogether that bad (see full review on my profile). I've come to realize that these games are not your typical point and click adventure. Let me explain. Most point and click adventure games (at least the ones I have played) are puzzle based. This game on the other hand is more dialog/clue based. There are a couple of puzzles in the game, but the game stays true to what it should be a murder mystery (Don't worry the game is not graphic at all, just a bunch of cartoon looking ghosts).I still give the first game about 6/10. The main reason being too much storyline setup, a couple of really annoying puzzles (the director apologized for these), and super short game. While not the best game, it accomplished something important. It is like the introduction to a very good book. You can not only see that the director learned from some of the mistakes made in this game to make Unbound much better. It also helped in being able to jump right into this one, as characters were already set up. If you want to play this game, it is important to play Blackwell Legacy (Hey, its short! Maybe that was a good thing). You can definitely put this on the buy list. Here are my Pro's and Con's.Pro's: Great Storyline for three different characters. Lauren Blackwell and the ghost she helps. The character interaction between Lauren and Joey is very good, you'll love these two characters and their relationship. No ridiculous puzzles in this one. Some hard one's, but nothing way out in left field. And the game is also longer too. Most of the stuff that was good or bad from the last game was improved on.Con's: Art is still not the best, but that is the style. Although the music music in this game probably did a better job at setting the right mood, there just weren't really any toe tapping tunes that the first game had.I'm working on Blackwell Convergance right now and it is going good thus far.Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!

												2nd series of my favourite point n click adventure games, it tells the story of Lauren Blackwell the aunt of Rose Blackwell, i think the 2nd series have the best soundtrack ,because of the jazz and ending song, the story is good, but maybe a bit short compared to the other series  ",806,412,31,136,82,10,128

												I thoroughly enjoyed the entire Blackwell series. The interesting story and characters and the great music and voices overcome the so-so graphics. Joey is a joy. The puzzles and story progression are generally logical. I found I needed to refer to a walkthrough only a few times. If you like adventure games with a good story, I can recommend playing the Blackwell series. Play them in sequence one after the other to get the full effect. This series is now in my Top 5 Adventure Games list.			",19,66,0,14,0,0,0

												It's a bold or possibly insane mind that makes the second episode of a series a flashback, especially after working so hard to establish characters in the previous episode.  And yet, somehow, Blackwell Unbound pulls it off admirably, all while adding some well-considered features and enhancements to the formula of the previous game.To be fair, the characters explored in Unbound aren't completely unrelated.  Returning (or pre-existing) from the previous entry is ghostly sidekick Joey Mallone, this time teamed up with Lauren Blackwell, aunt of the previous game's Rosangela Blackwell.  Much of Lauren's past was shrouded in mystery in the previous game, dialog hinting only vaguely at her life as a medium.  While this game doesn't give you all the answers, or even most of them, it does at least give you a pretty decent glimpse into her life before Rosa.The interface in Unbound is much the same as it was before: your standard Adventure Game interface, but with the added twist of a Notes page that lets you review and combine clues and facts.  Unbound adds another, very welcome feature: the ability to control Joey directly.  Rather than being little more than an object you interact with to complete certain puzzles, you can now float around in Joey's (lack of) shoes.  This makes Joey feel much more like a partner, vital to completing certain puzzles even, rather than a floating bit of comedic relief.Most of this game seems like a huge step forward for the series, despite chronologically being a step backward.  The dialog, the interface, even the ambiance and tone of the game all feel a bit more well developed and thought out.  This is still a short game - episodic and all - but despite the brief time spent in the game's version of 1973 New York you are still left with a very clear image of the city... at least as the game's developer meant to portray it.To be concise, Blackwell Unbound is a short-but-excellent example of the classic point-and-click Adventure game genre, and a worth sequel to the original Blackwell Legacy.  Despite the change in setting it does a good job of carrying the torch, so to speak, and provides an interesting plot complete with entertaining characters and clever-but-not-frustratingly-illogical puzzles.  Another title that anyone who has any love of the genre should feel confident in spending their money on.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												Your choice is really simple actually. If you enjoyed the first game of this series, ""The Blackwell Legacy"", you'll find this one even more enjoyable. It has ""better"" design, comparing to the previous installment, of course. It serves as a prequel, and follows a part of Lauren Blackwell's life, Rosangela's aunt. The soundtrack is much more improved and I really love the addition of Jazz and what not. Just get the entire bundle on this series, you will not regret it. Voice acting is basically equal to the previous title, and I love some of the recorded voices (especially Joey Mallone's). Please keep in mind that if you are not a fan of the point&click genre and if you mind playing a game with low resolution and low quality (pixelated) graphics, then the Blackwell series is not or you. I mean, the whole of WadjetEye's are not for you. Cuddos for The Shivah's easter egg. Really recommend this title.

												Here’s a point and click series that has been eight in years in the making. Fortunately, I did not spend eight years waiting to play them all as I started in early 2014, just in time for the last one to be released. The series aging poorly over a such a long time isn’t really an issue here as it’s done in the 90s style of point and click adventures. Pixel graphics, above-par voice acting, items to pick up and most of all, a compelling story.What do I think? Not bad, not bad at all. The characters draw you into well-written, appropriately voiced, engaging point-and-click adventure. It’s probably one of the most intuitive adventures I’ve played in a while (especially after playing Monkey Island and Sam & Max). It’s also the only point and click adventure I’ve played set in modern times, in the real world. It’s weird to have to think ‘modern’			",256,105,4,31,22,1,39

												The second part of the Blackwell Series is a prequel to the storie happening in part one, The Blackwell Legacy. Here you have to solve again mysterious cases of ghosts. Is it good? Yes! Is it long? No, you need maybe two to three hours of concentrated gameplay, and still - there are some things that have to be discovered and uncovered. It is recomended to make photos in the game, not only to solve the adventure, but also to get some fine background information.As a graphical adventure it is good to play and at some times there is some Laura Bow (Colonels Bequest, Dagger of Amon Ra) feeling coming up. Yes, I know, they are old-school and chances are you don't even know those classics. But I liked them back then a lot. Though easy in riddles, there were still enough things to solve.However, IF you have not played Blackwell Legacy, you are still able to get into the story.			",1554,811,52,244,215,11,265

												Blackwell Unbound is the second instalment in the Blackwell series, and interestingly, it’s a prequel to the first game, The Blackwell Legacy, set almost 30 years prior to the events of the first one.Unbound is where the series really kicks off and start the format of introducing more than one separate cases (ghost you need to save) in one game that in the end tie into a bigger plot. This episodic format restricts puzzle elements somewhat but it also removes the frustration that comes with most adventure games, especially the indie title where finding the solution to one puzzle requires you to explore a dozen or more maps for that elusive clue.The overall quality of the game is a step up from Legacy, the writing and the dialogues are improved by quite a lot, and puzzle solving still requires finding clues and combining them instead of the classic use Item A on Item B type, unrealistic adventure game method.Overall this is a very good follow-up on a promising first game, paving the path for the future instalments.

												An excellent prequel to The Blackwell Legacy.  This game digs into a bit of the backstory hinted at by the first game, but frustratingly leaves a lot of unanswered questions.... hopefully the next two games get to them.Overall it's a nice old school adventure game, with a mature and well-written plot and full (Decent) voice acting.  There is a bit of pixel hunting in a few scenes, which is annoying, and this forced me to a FAQ on two separate occasions.  For $5, this is a great 3 hours of entertainment, so be sure to snag it if you're an adventure game fan.			",110,90,0,23,14,0,38

												I liked the Blackwell Legacy better and can't really recommend this game unless it somehow completes the series.  There were few puzzles in this game; it was mostly ping-ponging between locations and clicking on lines of dialogue to make the story progress.  The voice acting and sound production was not as good as Legacy.  Recording artifacts like breath noise on the mic  stood out for me.  The ""extras"" that are unlocked after beating the game help; they are an inside look at voice acting, directing, and the concept art used to develop the game.			",111,52,0,6,6,0,6

												Story is perhaps more hardboiled and rather more interesting after playing both the prequel and the sequel. Even though they took out some fancy stuff like the nice avatars system and the pixelart was odd, Unbound sure has some of the fanciest art on the entire series, JUST LOOK AT THE DAMN COVER. I wonder why they changed it so much on Convergence.In term of game mechanics, us being able to control Joe for the first time was in fact a pretty good and solid development that was needed to make this franchise once again stand out. Unlike Convergence character development is small if not laughable, but that seems to be on purpose, since this one seems more like a setup for the last game in the story line.First title in the series in which I found no bugs too! Just like the others, get it if you find the bundle at a cheap price and in need for some noir settings and Convergence is worth playing the others to understand it fully.Edit from the future: There's in fact one more game to this series but I'm waiting to get it on sale before changing this review.

												New Features: Unbound (episode 2 and a prequel to Legacy) improves on the first game by making it possible to manually control either Lauren or Joey. This proves useful, as Joey can do certain things as a ghost that Lauren cannot. Unbound also replaces the ability to research leads via computer with researching leads via phonebook/telephone. This new research method is actually very fun, and once you realize how it works, you'll enjoy using it every time.Item / Inventory Use: Definitely in there, and you'll definitely use items on environment and also combine items; however item/inventory use is relatively downplayed compared to a lot of other point-and-clicks.Puzzle Quality: Very good! Puzzles are sort of ""L.A. Noir"" in nature. You interview NPCs to acquire information on particular subjects, and the important information you find is jotted down in a notebook. You can then use the idea in your notebook like inventory items during interviews with other NPCs to pry for new information. You can also combine ideas in your notebook if you think there is a connection, which can create new ideas and generate new leads to investigate. There are also inventory type puzzles, but the interview puzzles are the main attraction.Solution Quality: Very good solutions to puzzles and solutions make perfect sense. (Just make sure you exhaust all dialogues!) I never felt like solutions were illogical or overwrought nonsense. It's safe to say that this game avoids the hugest problem that games in this genre usually have.Story/Characters: Very good! In fact, this point-and-click emphasizes these aspects the most, so if those are the most important thing to you in a point-and-click, then you don't wanna miss out on the Blackwell games.Dialogue Quality: Very good! Lots of dialogue to explore, and the character dialogue is well-written, believable, and interesting.Length: Very short! Games in the Blackwell series are more like ""episodes"". You can take one down in one or two hours if you know your way around a point-and-click.VERDICT: As far as the point-and-click genre goes, you absolutely don't want to miss these---especially if story and characters are your favorite part.

												Blackwell Unbound is a prequel to the first game, Blackwell Legacy. This time you're Rosa's aunt, Lauren, and you get to solve two cases back in the 70s. Of course, something weirder than usual is going on. The sound quality is much better in this as opposed to in Legacy, which makes immersion easier. The art is excellent as usual. The game is only about two hours, but the story, writing, and characters make it well worth playing. Another gem from Wadjet Eye.			",233,375,2,75,46,1,45

												I'd certainly say this was a step up from the first game in the series; though it assumes knowledge from the first game and you'll likely be lost playing this one first.The story's stronger here and better paced, throwing you right in to things and keeping your attention the whole way through. The puzzles are very far from obscure and generally if you pay attention pretty simple, which is what I like to see. The stories of the characters here are all very intriguing and bittersweet in different ways; the ending especially is hard to know how to feel about, and I'm happy for that. It's also nice to be able to play as a character who was rather important to the first game but also dead there; gives her more depth, and she's certainly a far different character from Rosa. All in all I enjoyed this quite a lot and it's made me more interested in playing through the rest of the series.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

Honestly, I recommend the whole Blackwell series while I'm at it, Joey is such a lovable character and even if you don't enjoy the game you have to love him. Besides that there are interesting cases to solve and a lot of back tracking and thinking you have to do; you literally cannot win the game by spamming the mouse around the screen like most other games.

It  lacks the good storytelling in which the others excel and the color scheme is often jarring. Also figuring out what to do is really annoying at times (having to do something repeatedly, up to six times, annoys me.)If you like the Blackwell series skip this one.

												The second installment in the Blackwell series-- a big improvement on the first game, but gameplay still not very intuitive.

												Blackwell Unbound is a prequal and tells the story of your aunt Laura, who gets mentioned in the first game, and Joey. While still a bit short the game is longer then Legacy and the story more is far more interesting and fleshed out. As with all Wadjet Eye Games it is worth it to play through it again with the commentary track enabled. So once again if you like point and click adventure games go for it. 8/10			",564,222,18,114,74,3,72

												Initially I gave this game a recommendation, but really, it's borderline. It wasn't as terrible as the lfirst game but now I'm not so sure that means I can give a ringing declaration. It was an  OK time-waster; a poor man's Phoenix Wright, if you will. Tries and fails at humour but at least this sequel is solvable without walkthroughs, and you have two cases this time, so you can switch between them when you get a little stuck on one.I still had to change my screen resolution to prevent the text being cut off.

												Way too short, dialogue ""puzzles"" that make no sense, and voice acting thats all over the place.While this title shows us a few glimpses of what it could be, the execution is pretty poor. I can get over the poor voice acting (and a protagonist who smokes more than Dean Martin and throws her cigarettes any damn place she pleases), I can't get over the shortness of the game (could be run through in maybe 15 minutes a second time if you skip the voice acting) and the ""puzzles"" that require such a specific (and odd) series of actions to bypass. I use quotation marks around puzzles because I am refrerring to opening up dialogue options to progress the story. One example is with one npc who refuses to talk to you in detail about a particular subject no matter how you come at it. It takes the player having to switch to the ghost, having the ghost look at a particular item next to the character, then starting the dialogue all over again. There are no clues relating to the ghost looking at something. Signs of poor design, IMHO. I bought this for less than 2 bucks, so I'm not out a huge loss, but I think there are much better adventure games out there for the money.			",134,40,1,24,15,1,29

												This is a great adventure game.Beware, play all of te series or you will loose much of the story and fund.Fair puzzles, excellent story, and, ih, the music and ambient on this one is amazingly good.I enjoyed this one more than the first one.The story is sad, but hey, it's a game about life and death.If you are curious enough, you will find that the back-story of one of the NPC, it's actuallybased on a real reporter.If you can buy the pack, do it.These are the type of games, you can play relaxed and really enjoy the story, and,specially, the music on this one			",430,136,15,48,33,3,53

												Pros- Hmm the story is kind of interesting (not)Cons- Point and click (didn't feel like I was playing a video game)- Storytelling is a major flaw in this series which is quite funny since its point and click- graphics are pretty terrible - Bugs many of them that sometimes ruin the experience all together.Advice/Bottom Line:Do yourself a favour and never even bother thinking about purchasing this game, I got it in a pack full of different games so I myself had no intention to buy or play this game. The price might tempt you but believe me at any cost this game wouldn't be worth your money. I've seen flash point and click games on the internet that provide more entertainment than this poor excuse for a game. Not Recommended,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blackwell Unbound is the second chapter in the Blackwell series, where you once again use your point-and-click adventure skills to put wandering souls to rest. Unlike the Blackwell Legacy, which took place in modern times, Unbound takes place in the 1970's, which is why the New York skyline features the World Trade Center. This is a solid and retro-styled game with an excellent sense of storytelling. As you progress through the story, you develop an understanding of the tragedy in the victims lives and what keeps them anchored to the world. Plus, the steps you need to go through in order to advance provide quite a bit of challenge.If you find yourself experiencing a glitch where it doesn't register your Steam achievements, remember to verify the game's file cache.

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Additional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first in the series (Blackwell Legacy), since this is an episodic sort of series.Gameplay: The biggest addition is the ability to use Joey and Lauren (Rosangela isn't the protagonist to this game, much to my surprise) independently. This is used fairly often throughout the game. If you're coming from the first game, I'd still recommend leaving hints on, as otherwise this mechanic may blindside you (as it did me, wondering when Lauren was gonna finish her dang cig). Puzzles are a little bit more logical this time around, although one issue I had was that both my solution and the game's solution made sense (I thought of recording the song with my dictaphone and letting C hear it so he could get the ball rolling on what happened). It's better enough to show a marked improvement from the first game. 7/10.Story: Again, the big surprise for me was that we weren't playing as Rosangela this time around. I called one of the big twists early, which was kinda disappointing to me.  Hopefully the Countess isn't who I think it is, since that would be disappointingly easy to figure out. I enjoyed the slightly non-linear story, since you could do either case first. In terms of writing, it is a bit of a step down from Legacy, but it's still enjoyable nonetheless. 7/10.Graphics: It seems like we've gotten a consistent art style now, which is great. Plus, all the art is OC this time around, and it's all quite good. 4/5.Sound: Decidedly jazzy to fit the scenario; still quite good. Still a bit of issues with the recording quality of Joey's lines (popping every now and then). 4/5.Overall scores are: 7/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.3/10.			",508,69,16,41,32,3,65

												Second in the Blackwell series, Unbound is unique in that it focuses on Lauren Blackwell, the aunt of Rosangela Blackwell who is the protagonist in the other titles in the series. Lauren is a world-weary, lonely, chain-smoking smartass and is therefore one of my favorite characters ever, Unbound continues the retro point-and-click style, while adding a few new features to the game. As sharp and lovely as ever are the writing and music, and the humor is second to none.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												Played this shortly after the first.  For some odd reason, I found myself liking the first more.  Maybe it was the banter with Joey...not sure.  Still, a good game.  Well written, puzzles a bit harder than before ( got totally stumped on piano player), and a little more exciting than previously.  Voice acting is good -Joey is the best again.  The jazz....my main complaint.  A looping sax music segment literally gave me a heahache after awhile and I chose to play with no sound until that was over.  It's funny and entertaining while still being a challenge.  That's what a good adventure game should be and it does it well.			",1011,387,22,98,38,6,71

												Just finished the second of the Blackwell series. The game is not a continuation of the first, but more of a ""prequel"", looking at one of the adventures of Joey and Rosa's aunt Lauren. The game a defintley easier and shorter then the first. But I think at least part of that is due to game having similar games mechanics and play style to the first game. You have your notebook, and a few other tools to find information, though this time the computer is replaced with the yellow pages (this does take place a long while ago). The one thing I did find annoying was having to constantly go back to the apartment to look something up in the yellow pages. I so badly wanted Lauren to stick that thing in a backpack and take it with her. But the apartment is a good place to chat with Joey and the only place you can make calls, so my nickpick is small. This one was... a lot more solem then the first. If you've played the first game, then you know what becomes of the characters in the sequel, so many parts were bittersweet. And just like the first, we are faced with more questions then answers about Joey, his connection to Lauren and her family, and the ""rules"" involved with being a medium. Which isn't a bad thing. There is still 2* more games of the series, after all. All in all, I'm eager to play the next game!*Review update: 3 games acutally. Last one in the series was released this year. Guess what just made it onto my wishlist!! X3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blackwell Unbound is the second game in the Blackwell series. Much like the first, it has the same type of gameplay associate with point and click adventure games.  One exception is that you can play as Joey this time. A neat idea that is integrated well into the game. This time you are a medium investigating some mysterious killings around the town. The plot is simple and easy to follow. Click  here  for my review on the first game, Blackwell Legacy. Most of it I will repeat for this game.The puzzles are, again, not hard. Some clever thinking ( Like recording the duet on your dictation machine. ) may be needed but nothing overwhelming. I experienced no crashes or graphical glitches during my playthrough. There is an autosave feature as well as a manual save. As before, you still cannot cancel an action once clicked. To make the game look better and in higher resolution +Open “winsetup” in the SteamApps -> common -> Blackwell Legacy folder+Graphics Driver = Direct3D 9+Graphics filter = 4x nearest-neighbor filterPros+Story and pacing are good+Retro/pixel graphics+Dialog is well paced (and skippable if you want)+Characters fleshed out well+Game commentaryCons+Can’t cancel an action once invoked +Some voice quality isn’t good. Need pop filter on microphone+A few times the text on the screen wasn’t what was saidA good sequel (prequel) that I feel is on par or better than Blackwell Legacy. 6/10 Above average  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm still partial to Blackwell Legacy, but I'm in it for the story--so wanted to check this prequel out. I find the artwork a bit (and only a bit) lacking as compared to the original game's art, except for the area inside the main character's mind (I love how Lauren's mind place looks as compared to Rosa's). The ""quest/case"" menu definitely lacked the first game's case menu originality. The music is still pretty good (although for the sax music, it sounds synthesized.. because it didn't quite sound like the fully body of an alto or a tenor [appearance varied depending on perspective... ghost sax looked alto, portrait sax looked tenor... but the sound was closer to alto] sax sound like I was expecting (I played for several years, as long as I could), Joey's vocals and lines are still by far the best, and the story is... well, it is what it is. I know this isn't a raving review, but it's not necessarily negative either. I feel like this part of the story was meant more for the creator than the fans. There are a lot of little nuances that don't necessarily appeal to me--Joseph Mitchell and his vocals irritate the snot out of me, the Shivah achievement is purely a nod to the creator's previous work and therefore comes across self-aggrandizing, the commentary achievement (ack, again?!) is still annoying (but thank goodness he told us about being able to skip over them), and the two different smoking achievements... not clever forcing the people to replay the game more than they may want just to get an achievement. If I'm getting all of these other achievements, I might as well have all of them... right? Ha.Overall, the story--worth it. The addition of the Countess was a brilliant idea and I can see where this might go in the next three games. At least, I hope some form of this character is revisited somehow (hopefully, no spoilers here). Most of what doesn't appeal to me wouldn't bother others.			",441,274,13,79,34,2,42

												Good game. This time you play as Rosa's aunt, Lauren in the 1970's when she's doing her thing helping ghosts cross over to the other side, before she ends up in the loony bin. I actually like Lauren better than Rosa. She's got more of an edge and she chain smokes. Jamming a lit cigarette into someones eye is one of the solutions too. There's even an achievement for smoking enough cigs during the course of the game. Some of the details that are introduced in Legacy are fleshed out in this game. I dug the 1970s detective vibe this game had going for it. I liked this one better Legacy, but it still has some of the frustrating dialogue tree and note book item combining puzzles that drove me crazy. This was a good 2nd act.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												See my Blackwell Legacy recomendation. I'll simply compare this game to that one. This is the second game in the series.Blackwell Unbound adds a lot to the series. The game is a bit longer, since there are two caes to solve, which is a welcome change since the first game was so short. The logic is much easier to follow this time around, though the clue-combining system really doesn't work very well. Lauren is more interesting in this game than Rosa was. This game also introduces a few plot elements that are continued in later games, unlike Legacy, which merely set up the world. ",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												See my previous review (Blackwell Legacy).  This game has the same engine (thus no volume control), and doesn't have any stupid puzzles like the previous one did.  The character in this prequel game is way more likeable in that she is a despondent dead-to-the-world chain smoker named Lauren with the touch of humor and a good voice actor.  2-3hr playtime, solve two ghost stories and have a chunk of extra at the end.  Again, its not really my kind of story but the character Lauren did help me enjoy it a lot more.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

Which although not up to today's graphics standards and definately has a very short duration is fun to play through. I would recommend this although I did get this at the budget price for the full bundle and consider the current full price steep for this extremely short adventure.Recommended, 6 out of 10.

												This game is a sequel (part 2 of 4), so my review is strictly comparative. If you're looking to get started with the series, The Blackwell Legacy is what you're looking for.Blackwell Unbound proves to be a considerably stronger game than its predecessor. Whereas the voice actress for BL's protagonist Rosangela delivered a bland performance, BU's protagonist Lauren is engaging and brings life to the game. Unbound benefits from some lessons learned by the developers coming off the first title as well: the user interface is a bit more intuitive.Like its predecessor, I would put this game solidly into middle ground. I considered the first game a solid 'meh' and my reception to this one is a little warmer. Fans of point-and-click adventure titles will find some enjoyment here, but I wouldn't recommend this strongly to gamers who don't already have a pretty good sense for what they're in for.

												The second Blackwell game, a prequel, builds well on the strengths of the first game - strong story and characters, easy interface and connection of clues through a notebook. You also have a few new gadgets to use, which help make a logical and clever way to move the story on. The relationship between the two leads is just as strong, but Lauren is much more world-weary than Rosa (the female lead in the first game in the series). This suits the darker tone of the stories and serves well to show how living with a spirit guide and dealing with unresolved death could take its toll. One thing the game lacks for me is the use of close-ups when a character is speaking, which I loved in the first game. Still a great game though.			",631,374,6,52,53,3,74

												A simple, yet amazing, point-and-click adventure game with an amazing storyline. Unbound, the second game in the Blackwell quadrilogy, is actually a prequel to Legacy, and tells the story of Lauren Blackwell, Rosangela's aunt from the first game.With a nice jazz soundtrack, a great story, professional voice acting and challenging-but-logical puzzles, its very easy to recommend this game. Its a bit short, but its so cheap it really worth it. Better yet, but all four games in the series. You'll NOT be disappointed.			",249,83,4,78,7,0,12

Maybe some things will be revealed about how auntie loses her mind. The game as a good story, and because its a prequel we are always wondering how the events of the game lead to the Legacy game.Some things that we need to note that it wasn't on the games notebook increased the difficulty but gave another feel to the game. In the end i loved the game and get to know Rose's auntie was amazing.It also left even more questions to be answered.			",137,38,0,12,5,1,12

												I recently discovered the Blackwell series and was instantly charmed by the first installment. It features a female protagonist who is real in her representation and oddly awkward and socially maladjusted (It's charming). Blackwell Unbound, the second installment, features similar point and click problem solving while revealing an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, this game is not nearly as interesting as the first and comparatively there are very few out-of-the-box problem solving situations. It lays flat compared to its predecessor but still offers some benefits to those who are dedicated to the series. 6/10.			",1,6,0,1,0,0,0

												My experience with Blackwell Unbound was completely different than my experience with The Blackwell Legacy, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Some of the problems I had with the first entry were remedied in Blackwell Unbound, while some of the shining points in the first game were surprisingly absent from this game. The story premise has really started to interest me. I think it has the same kind of longevity as some template-based TV serials like X-Files or Star Trek. In his commentary track, Dave Gilbert discusses the ""lingering ghost"" trope and why it's interesting, and he's right--it is interesting. As far as the story goes, I am now ""on-board"" with the Blackwell games (although the final scene of Blackwell Unbound posed a huge moral problem for me). It was really cool to play as Lauren; she is an interesting character, especially alongside Joey. I wish I could have seen more interaction between them. The gameplay of Blackwell Unbound differs from its predecessor by allowing the player to switch between playing as Joey and playing as Lauren. I think this is and always has been a cool mechanic. Unfortunately, unlike some other successful adventure games who have used this mechanic, like Maniac Mansion and The Cave, Blackwell Unbound doesn't really make good use of the ability to switch characters. Joey is only necessary for a couple of small actions, and he is otherwise unnecessary. However, Gilbert does explain in the commentary track that Blackwell Unbound was meant to be a short project to tide players over until the more ambitious Blackwell Convergence was finished, so I assume that the character-switching will be put to better use in the next game in the series.The graphics and voice acting are other pieces of evidence that Blackwell Unbound seems to have been given less thought and attention than the first game (I have not yet played Convergence, so I can't compare). I was really impressed with The Blackwell Legacy's graphics and voice acting; everything looked really painstakingly drawn, and the voice actors gave great performances. Although some of the environments in Blackwell Unbound look really great (Jambalaya Records, Lauren's apartment) some of the environments looked pretty rushed (the map screen, the construction site), and there were a couple times I turned down my speakers because I was embarrassed that someone might hear the terrible voice acting. The problem with the voice acting seems to be that the actors were not very well-matched for the roles they played. Three of the characters (The Countess, Harriet Sherman, and Joseph Mitchell) are 50+ years old but are voiced by young people trying to imitate ""old"" voices, which makes for some really cringe-worthy moments. Another character, Dwayne, has a pretty embarrassing Jamaican accent and in the credits he appears to be voiced by a white guy. I hate to criticize peoples' acting abilities, especially since I'm certain I'd be absolutely terrible at it, but I feel like the voice performances in Blackwell Unbound really got in the way of my enjoying the game. The puzzle logic in Blackwell Unbound really irked me, too. Obviously, in a series like Blackwell, the player needs to discover clues to progress. In Blackwell Unbound, there's a really cool mechanic that tasks the player with remembering and manually entering into a phonebook names that other characters mention in dialogue. I love it when games make me pull out a pad of paper and a pencil to solve a puzzle. My problem is that most of the ""clues"" seem really obvious and unnaturally forced into the dialogue (""That's how we treat your kind at Johnny Ivory's!""), so it felt like Gilbert left a really obvious trail of breadcrumbs for me to follow. The commentary track this time features Gilbert alongside one of the game's artists. It is sometimes interesting to hear about the processes they went through in designing the game. Dave Gilbert wasn't as annoying to me as he was in the commentary for The Blackwell Legacy; maybe he's growing on me. In summary, Blackwell Unbound was a much more interesting game than The Blackwell Legacy, but I think The Blackwell Legacy had a greater level of polish and seemed more like a complete game. I'm excited to play Blackwell Convergence, and I hope it has some decent voice-acting.			",263,186,1,31,25,1,27

												Second in the Blackwell series, Unbound is unique in that it focuses on Lauren Blackwell, the aunt of Rosangela Blackwell who is the protagonist in the other titles in the series. Lauren is a world-weary, lonely, chain-smoking smartass and is therefore one of my favorite characters ever, Unbound continues the retro point-and-click style, while adding a few new features to the game. As sharp and lovely as ever are the writing and music, and the humor is second to none.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												In many ways the gameplay in this second Blackwell game is improved over the first, though there are still some bits I wasn't keen on, like having to type people's names to look them up in the phone book, but what really stands out is that the characters and story in this one are just vastly better than the first.Joey and Rosa, in the first game, don't know each other yet, whereas Lauren and Joey here have been together a while, so the dynamic is a lot friendlier and more fun, and I just love Lauren as a character. I'd actually really like to play more games focused on her rather than Rosa (although I do like Rosa too).The main issue I have with this game is the voice acting. The old women are played by young women, and it shows. That's the only issue though, the other characters are fine, but young women trying to sound old just never works.But apart from that it's a fantastic game.			",193,117,4,20,20,3,38

												This game is a prequel of the first game in the Blackwell series, and is fairly similar to it. The plot is similar, some characters are the same, and the gameplay in general is that of a nicely crafted adventure game. There are however some differences also, such as different art style, different dynamic between characters, and some adjustments to gameplay from the first game. Without going into spoilers too much, here are pros and cons, according to me.PROS: Low price;Really good story, better than the first game, in my opinion;Interesting dialogue;Better puzzles, didn't get stuck as much as the first one;CONS:Absolutely completely remarkably poor choice of achievements, some are impossible to find without the guide, some are downright annoying. Sure some are OK, but that is not an excuse for the two smoking achievements that have no purpose and do nothing except irritate the player who has to replay the game just because the girl smoked and extra smoke or did not smoke enough.Less likable art style, art feels rushed and, well, amateurish. No character portraits, which is disappointing, especially compared to the first game. Needed to play the game twice to get the commentary achievement, and then another time to get the smoking achievements (the girl smokes more when Joey is active and you are listening to the commentary). This is 3 times I had to play a game that does not change one bit from playthrough to playthrough. I find this completely unacceptable and poor game design (believe it or not, achievements are part of game design, and if you choose to include them, make sure they add to the game and not subtract from it).I feel the need to type things in manually demands more from player, as in have a piece of paper and a pen on them when playing. I found this to be somewhat annoying, A game should not need to do that to a player.Overall, I can only recommend this game because of the good story and puzzles.			",515,196,6,66,67,4,108

												If you haven't played The Blackwell Legacy, that is the ONLY reason I would not recommend playing this game, because you will need to understand some of the backstory before jumping into Blackwell Unbound. Unbound is very close to the perfect point-and-click adventure game playthrough, because every puzzle is both story-related and logical [unlike, say, giving human medicine to a dog assuming it will work the same rather than kill the animal]. The only frustrating part is trying to get the Chain Smoker achievement--especially toward the end when Lauren decides that one cigarette will be her last for the night--and possibly trying to figure out the Floating Head Easter egg without help. Bonus being an inexpensive game with Trading Cards, if you're into that kind of thing.			",56,43,1,5,2,0,11

												This is a prequal to The Blackwell Legacy, allowing you to delve into some character bulding and stories as played out by your Aunt (which you do not meet in the first game, she is dead.At first I wasn't sure if I enjoyed the character but as the cases and story progressed I grew really fond of the main character (more so than the previous game's). It has a few additions to the point-and-click system over the previous game, allowing you to utilise items from your inventory in the game world. This allows for access to some bonus game material and pivotal story points to progress the game.Overall, the story did not let me down. At times it was sad and at other times rather thrilling.

												Blackwell is a great series, and this game is where it really comes into its own. It's got a great 1970s ambience that feels fittingly both tacky and lush, and a smokey jazz soundtrack. These both perfectly compliment the chain-smoking protagonist who just can't bring herself to care about much anymore. The game does a good job of telling its own story, and of adding great background and depth to the Blackwell series.			",31,46,0,9,2,0,8

												I love the Blackwell series.  It's a collection of relatively short, story-rich mystery games.  The voice acting is excellent, and, except for the first game, the ambience is so deliciously noir with a great smooth-jazz soundtrack.  While the actual graphics are, obviously, old-school adventure-game pixelly, the game is still beautiful. Regarding Blackwell Unbound specifically: I found the female protagonist - Lauren Blackwell - to be a pleasure. A young-yet-jaded, snarky, chain-smoking pleasure.  The relationship between Lauren and Joey is... hard to describe... but it works so well that this may be my favourite of the series.			",57,126,1,22,44,0,14

												Blackwell Unbound, the second game of the five part Blackwell series is a minor masterpiece in adventure gaming.I just played the first game, Blackwell Legacy, yesterday.  Having known very little about the series going in, I have to say I enjoyed it, while not being particularly overwhelmed by it.  Before tackling this second game, I did a little bit of reading on it.  The general gist I got was that most people felt this second game was inferior to the first, and that it might be a little to short or too slight in content.I could not disagree more.  Whereas the first game was a nice enjoyable story, I found this second one leaps and bounds superior.  I did not find it too short (and really, what does ""too short"" mean when you're only paying a few bucks for a game?).  And the ending was pretty darn clever from a plot standpoint.  Unlike the first game, there is a consistent tone to Unbound, helped tremendously by the excellent jazz-tinged music score.  Unbound takes place in the span of one night--and the everpresent night scenes coupled with the themes of loss and regret gives Unbound a wonderful sense of poetry, of sadness.  And considering that this is a low-resolution game in the graphical spirit of early LucasArts games, it's somewhat miraculous that such a tone could be achieved.  Another criticism I've come across (and also disagree with) is that the game doesn't ""help you"" enough in terms of the notebook feature.  Some people have gone really overboard and called the notebook ""broken.""  The complaint seems to center around the idea that you as a player in real life shouldn't have to make any logical deductions on your own, but rather have the game itself spell it all out for you in Lauren's notebook.  It's ironic.  On the one hand people complain that the game is too short, on the other, they don't seem to want to take the time to ponder puzzles or be stuck on them.  I think in this modern age some people don't remember that adventure games traditionally had ""being stuck on a puzzle"" time factored INTO their play time.  So when you'd read descriptions of old King's Quest games and they claim to have 30 hours of game time, that's assuming the players don't just read from a walkthrough like some digital version of paint by numbers.  You're kind of supposed to have to think over things and figure things out in adventure games.  Besides, it's all rather moot.  I mostly found it pretty self-evident when the game wanted you to write down specific names that came up and look them up on your own.  The one (rather clever) puzzle, that I indeed was stuck on for a time, had to do with making observations about a photograph in Lauren's inventory.  I think some people honestly wanted the game to make this observation for the player and spell it out in Lauren's notebook without any intuitive thinking required..  But frankly, if the game had done such things, it would've robbed the player of so much of the point of experiences like this.In Unbound there is a different protagonist than the rest of the Blackwell games.  And that proves to be a double-edged sword in a way, as I actually liked this character (Lauren) better than Rosa, the other lead.  I will say that it does make for some mixed feelings regarding Lauren given that she--SPOILER ALERT--apparently spends the last 25 years of her life a miserable vegetable in a mental hospital.  (That's what we learned about her in the first game.)  So the bittersweet ending of this has that extra edge to it.I'm curious if the subsequent games ever bring some kind of satisfying resolution--impossible as it may seem--to Lauren's fate.So to sum up:  Blackwell Unbound is a great throwback to point and click, low-resolution, plot-centric adventure gaming.  And frankly, given the strength of its writing and the richness of tone (again, gotta love that jazz), in many ways it's better than a lot of the games that came from the so-called ""golden"" era.  If you are a lover of adventure games, then you really need to check this series out.  These games are selling for a song these days, so there's no excuse not to reward the developers for their talent and hard work.			",20,86,0,2,0,0,2

												An improvement over Blackwell Legacy with some cool dual-character puzzle solving. The game also mostly addresses Legacy's problem of not adequately updating you on getting new items and notebook clues. Lauren Blackwell's also a more appealing protagonist than Legacy's Rosangela Blackwell -- less helpless, more worldly, and with the throaty voice of a chainsmoker rather than a nasal whine.

												Blackwell Unbound is the second chapter in the Blackwell series, where you once again use your point-and-click adventure skills to put wandering souls to rest. Unlike the Blackwell Legacy, which took place in modern times, Unbound takes place in the 1970's, which is why the New York skyline features the World Trade Center. This is a solid and retro-styled game with an excellent sense of storytelling. As you progress through the story, you develop an understanding of the tragedy in the victims lives and what keeps them anchored to the world. Plus, the steps you need to go through in order to advance provide quite a bit of challenge.If you find yourself experiencing a glitch where it doesn't register your Steam achievements, remember to verify the game's file cache.

												This is a prequal to The Blackwell Legacy, allowing you to delve into some character bulding and stories as played out by your Aunt (which you do not meet in the first game, she is dead.At first I wasn't sure if I enjoyed the character but as the cases and story progressed I grew really fond of the main character (more so than the previous game's). It has a few additions to the point-and-click system over the previous game, allowing you to utilise items from your inventory in the game world. This allows for access to some bonus game material and pivotal story points to progress the game.Overall, the story did not let me down. At times it was sad and at other times rather thrilling. It didn't last very long but I'd recommend it all the same.			",133,43,4,27,14,2,7

												See my Blackwell Legacy recomendation. I'll simply compare this game to that one. This is the second game in the series.Blackwell Unbound adds a lot to the series. The game is a bit longer, since there are two caes to solve, which is a welcome change since the first game was so short. The logic is much easier to follow this time around, though the clue-combining system really doesn't work very well. Lauren is more interesting in this game than Rosa was. This game also introduces a few plot elements that are continued in later games, unlike Legacy, which merely set up the world. ",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												Just like Legacy:Has its flaws, some might find it a bit too narrative heavy. The whole Blackwell series is marvelous.Astonishing characters, humor, voices and graphics (if you like the style).A must-play for every point&click fan.			",146,86,2,49,9,0,6
