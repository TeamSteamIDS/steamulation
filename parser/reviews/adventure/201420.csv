												Toki Tori 2+ is not at all the game I was expecting it to be. The original game was a series of self-contained puzzle levels that were solved using a limited set of items. Toki Tori 2 is not that at all. Instead, the game drops you in the middle of a vast open 2D world and leaves you to figure everything out on your own. There are no instructions, tutorials, levels or items. The whole world is open from the start and you just need to figure out how to get through it while collecting a series of, err... collectibles. Unlike the previous game, Toki no longer uses items to solve puzzles. Instead, your abilities are limited to walking, singing and stomping. That's it. Where the complexity (and genius) comes in is how you can combine those actions with the various creatures that populate the world. For example, you can lure birds to pick you up with chirps, move bugs by stomping, and much, much more. I won't say anything further on that, as half the fun is figuring out the rules of the game on your own. As with the previous game, level/puzzle design is utterly brilliant. So many times you will think there is no way to proceed past an area, only to have the solution click a few minutes later (and you subsequently smack yourself upside the head because of how simple it actually was). That is a sign of good design, and I admire it a lot. I can't really think of any puzzles that were totally unfair, although there were a handful that were somewhat tedious. The singing mechanic is also a pretty neat new feature. In addition to its standard functionality, you learn a series of songs that provide other abilities, such as time-rewind, warping around the map, and more. And oh yeah, the characters are all really cute - especially Toki and the frogs (if you're into that sort of thing as a selling point). It all comes together nicely in a really well-executed package. Overall, I liked this a lot better than the first game, due to the open-ended exploration/collection gameplay and the ""complex simplicity"" in the puzzle design. It's a fun, laid-back game that should appeal to puzzle fans. A-			",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

												For quite a while, I wasn't sure whether I was going to give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  On one hand, it's a very charming game with some interesting and at times challenging puzzles.  On the other hand, it is absolutely nothing like what I was expecting after having played the first Toki Tori game.The first Toki Tori involved you using a variety of gadgets to solve puzzles in a small area.  Your goal is to gather eggs, of which there are a known amount in every level.  It was a fun, challenging puzzle game and I wanted more.Toki Tori 2+, now... You don't have any gadgets. In fact, the only two abilities you have are to sing and to do a ground pound, neither of which were in the first game. Those are the only two things you will use to solve every single puzzle in the game.It's also a pseudo-Metroidvania map style now.  I say ""pseudo"" because you don't really gain new abilities to unlock new areas.  You can access any part of the game from the very beginning, just so long as you know what to do. Not necessarily a bad departure.There are no tutorials. At all. You have to figure out everything on your own. And I have to wonder why they left out anything explaining the basic functions of the game. Tori 1 had a single tutorial level for each new gadget you used. Here, there's no dialogue or explanation of anything. Even in the pause menu, you have several icons and you have to figure out what they mean for yourself.In Toki Tori 1, you had the clear goal of finding all of your eggs to complete a level. In Toki Tori 2, I'm not sure what exactly you're gathering or why. Instead of eggs, you're gathering... something. They're yellow shiny things, but I don't know why you need to get them. Actually, after playing six hours of the game, I'm still not even sure if gathering the somethings actually has an impact on the game, apart from a sense of completion. There's also no indicator for how many somethings you've found or haven't found, so if I was going for full completion, I would have no way of knowing how many I'd missed. I cared about gathering eggs because they helped me finish a level. Here, I don't even know what I'm gathering, much less why, so why should I care?That sort of brings me to another point. Without any sort of guidance, I have no idea what to do or why to do it. Even open world games like Skyrim or KOTOR gave you an idea of what to do. With Toki Tori 2+ I've just spent hours wandering around the world map (after figuring out how to use it - which I needed a walkthrough to figure out), solving puzzles, and looking at the pretty visuals. It all feels rather pointless if the entire end result is just that you see more scenery.That being said, the game is very charming. It's a very interesting world and there are some beautiful settings. The puzzles also can be very interesting, if a bit repetetive (there's only so many times you can get a frog to cough up a bubble before you're just going through the motions). I wouldn't say I hate the game, just that it's not at all what I expected based on the first game and that I'm a bit confused why they decided to change, well... everything.As the sequel to Toki Tori 1, I do have to say that I was a bit let down. Change in a sequel is good, but you do have to keep enough the same that it's at least recognizable as a sequel. However, as a standalone game, my only real complaint would be that without anything to explain what we're doing or why, there's no purpose. Apart from that, it's still a fun game. Perhaps for that reason, I'll give it a thumbs up. However, if you're planning to buy this because you liked the first game, keep in mind that it won't be similar at all.			",120,65,0,16,7,0,9

												I've rarely been more engrossed by a game, felt more respected as a player, or allowed to figure stuff out so much as in this game.  This is the rare game that requires the player to truly use inductive reasoning skills to reach a solution using given parts that seem not to be applicable to the problem at hand at all.Inductive reasoning is very rare in games.Get this for your children to help hone their reasoning and creative problem solving skills.  And make sure to spend some time with it yourself.This is one of the best entertainment experiences -- of any type -- that I have ever had.  You will learn without instructions.  You will teach yourself the rules and then the game will demand mastery.Zero hand holding.Extremely pleasant zen-like atmosphere.Absolutely brutally difficult puzzles with real design-based challenges created purely by the contextual interaction of persisten rules.  NO puzzle designer mindreading or artificial ""challenges.""What are you waiting for?  If you like thoughtful games at all buy this immediately.			",41,37,0,3,8,0,7

												This game has some of the most ingenious mechanical and puzzle design you will ever see. It somehow manages to have metroidlike progression, where you see treasures and routes you can't take yet, but will on later visits, despite having no unlockable player abilities. It achieves this unprecedented feat by teaching you new and non-obvious mechanics as you progress through the various stages, which you can then use to solve other challenges you passed earlier. This teaching happens organically as you solve puzzles; there is no text or spoken dialogue in the game. Toki Tori 2 is an under-appreciated gem and one of the best puzzle games ever made. 10/10			",312,106,10,23,30,0,44

												Suprisingly well executed puzzle game with slight platforming elements. It is actually one of a kind puzzle-exploration game. Imagine Metroid, where You can progress not because of new abilities, but because of the knowledge You earn by visiting new places, which allow You to solve puzzles You encountered earlier.Challenging to complete the story, but collecting all the collectibles is close to insane task, highly recommended ;)			",358,119,9,42,25,2,61

												I have bought this game with the intent of supplying fun game to kids. Shortly after starting it, I realized that ME - not really a kid anymore - have already played it for five hours straight! Game doesn't give any instructions - and that's 50% of fun, from discovering things yourself. It's a great feature, some of us, relying on tutorials for every game out there, already forgot.That said, I wouldn't recommend this game for kids, buy it if you like solving gradually harder puzzles of ""how to get up on that platform?"" or ""there should be 10 items on this level I have only 5, where's the rest?"". You need to make surrounding creatures to do your bidding by singing for them, stomping the ground around or teleporting them wherever they're needed.  You'll be lighting dark areas with a fairy, which you need to invite there by singing, you will use frog's bubbles to raise to higher areas, you will even need frogs bubble-fly another frog from time to time. Sometimes you will need that pesky bird, which god-knows-why has uber-affection for you, to be removed by zapping it with two slugs. There are times, when you will have wondered ""how to get up there?"", but having progressed slightly further you will discover new ways to do things, something you haven't thought of before, or just simply a new ability. This makes you go back and complete that task you haven't done before.Warning to those that are alergic to trying things repeatedly and failing 90% of the time - you're gonna want to be zapped by a slug yourself, so try another game.Writing anything more would be a big spoiler on how the game works, so enough to say - get it, you won't regret it.

												Pleasant background music, challenging puzzles and cute animals (vampire bats and evil masks excluded). Game is now open-world rather than a set of different levels, and Toki Tori now only has a whistle and stomp ability and will often need to use the abilities of the creatures inhabiting that location to reach next collectible or checkpoint location.The game is a bit difficult to follow initially as there are no instructions on how or why Toki Tori starts out moving in the forest, and what are the things the player has to look out for and to do to progress in the game. Eventually, the game will reward the player with achievements and secret locations for those who attempt to reach the ending and obtain every collectible in the game.			",640,597,10,116,100,5,75

												I want a neutral button, I don't recommend it if you loved the first one or if you like to play games without having to look up what is the point of this or if you like puzzles in the normal sense of the word. But it's pretty and there are puzzles kind of, but this wasn't at all what I expected after playing Toki Tori 1 and I was disapointed. It's not a puzzle game like the first game it's an open world 2D platform explorer with puzzle elements. And like the new blurb says it tells you nothing about anything you have to figure out everything yourself, there is no kinda of tutorial at all. But it's not bad so I don't not recommend it if this is what you looking for, just be aware it's nothing like the first Toki Tori.			",222,222,11,25,33,3,35

												Great puzzle game! I enjoyed every moment playing with that charming little chicken. Some parts of the game can be very challenging and you will have to think a lot to beat it.You can be lost sometimes because you can choose more than one path you will follow on the map.The achievements are really nice to unlock and some of them add interesting stuff on story. To complete 100% achievements it's necessary to finish the game at least twice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great graphics, gameplay, puzzles, sound and animations. The music though i personally prefer the lat one. Never the less, the game is actually fun to play and i would also recommend even the kids to play this game :). Mind the puzzles though, they can get a lot challenging as you progress further.

												Toki Tori 2+ isn't just one of the cutest games, but also an expertly crafted puzzle game. The satisfaction of discovering its secrets is immense. I've seen it mentioned as a metroidvania, but you could call it that only in the slightest sense. Central to the game is a beautifully rendered island in which you manipulate creatures and your environment in order to progress through puzzles that don't look like puzzles. The latter really makes it feel more like a beautiful exploration platformer, with an art-style and -direction that tell you that this game was a labor of love.			",410,158,7,49,24,5,61

One can actually go as far as say that design decisions for this game are flawless.Add cutesy style to that, variety of puzzles (from♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to ""♥♥♥♥ it i'm out of here"") and you have Toki Tori 2. Which, by the way, plays nothing like the first one. So if you loved the first- you still will like this one. If you hated the first - there's a high chance you will like this one.

												A challenging, adorable puzzle platformer that forces you to think your way into -- and out of -- pretty much every situation the game has to offer. There are puzzles. secrets. more puzzles. easter eggs, and even more puzzles. These are handled differently than the first game, which gave you tools to solve the mostly static playfield. This time around, you are plopped in a world and told, ""Go"" and not much else.I know some people wanted more of a narrative, and I can see their reasoning, but I'm okay with having what's essentially a classic puzzler in a shiny new coating.If you can tone down the rage, haha, this could be a fantastic game to play with family members -- including kids. Working together to solve challenges, then celebrating the solution could really bring folks together.Dig platformers and/or games that require a bit of thought? Give this a spin. It's almost always on sale, so the risk is minimal. I do recommend the first game as well, and Two Tribes often bundle them along with one (or both) of their other titles. That's the way to go, I think. Happy gaming!			",191,101,10,53,13,0,26

												I regret not playing Toki Tori 2 sooner. I remember when it first launched on the Wii U, during the system's first big drought in 2013. Back then, despite having a lot of time in my hands and not much to play on the console, I let it go. Then I got it in a bundle for Steam, and once again, didn't play it for years. I had played the first Toki Tori and mistakenly assumed the sequel would be more of the same.When I heard Toki Tori 2 was actually a metroidvania, my interest grew. Regardless of that, I still had cold feet. There's something about the game's pre-rendered visuals that always made it look kinda cheap. I also thought it would be more of a chore than anything else, like many other metroidvanias that fail to play to the genre's strengths.Then I finally played it and it really grabbed me. The presentation, which had always seemed so unappealing, came to life in a glorious way when I booted the game. It's GORGEOUS. It's a really weird art style, in that it doesn't sell well, but looks great when you're actually playing. Music and sound design also make a great job of immersing the player in Toki Tori's wonderful world, without ever getting repetitive.There are so many elements populating the screen, everything looks so much alive. Actually, that's Toki Tori 2's main catch: YOU CAN SEQUENCE BREAK THE HELL OUT OF THIS GAME. All the tiny animals you initially think of as mere set dressing are meant to be interacted with, you might just not know it at the time. Midway through the game, you happen to come back to the very first screen. Up to that point, Toki Tori 2 gently teaches you about its surprisingly deep mechanics through great level design. Now you're are able to truly see it with new eyes. That bird over there? You can call it by chirping, make it grab that little animal and feed it to that frog so that you can go up that ledge. Those fireflies? Make sure they follow you, you're gonna need them.You don't ever get new items or power-ups. The only thing preventing you to venture out in any direction at any given time is your knowledge of how the game works, and it makes a great job at teaching you that. That alone makes Toki Tori 2 extremely replayable as well, since not only will you want to try new paths in a different order, but the game's puzzles are not only deep enough to lock collectibles away during the first time you play them, but also so much fun you're gonna want to give them another try just for the sake of it.It all comes together so tightly that, like I said, I regret not playing it sooner. The game's inability to sell well when it should have actually bankrupted Two Tribes' developing arm, and the upcoming Rive is going to be their last game. Maybe it would have helped if the media had made more noise about this game back when it first launched. Maybe it would have helped if I hadn't been so skeptical as well. Toki Tori 2 is a truly underrated gem and if like me you're a fan of great level design, do yourself a favor: PLAY IT ASAP!			",323,130,6,39,30,3,48

												Toki Tori 2+ is a one of a kind experience, an underrated gem that brings puzzle games into a new light.While there are -no- tutorials, many mechanics are introduced discreetly throughout the game, exploiting the only two abilities the player has. (Stomp and chirp) A useful point to note about this: 'Side paths' often require an undiscovered method of using your abilities. These tricks are introduced in different places of the world map, and to avoid frustration, clear what seems easier and head back after exploring other parts of the world.Some puzzles, often special areas, are extremely tedious. A slight mistake and the entire process starts over. Unfortunately, rewind mode doesn't exist.*The main problem with the game is sustaining interest of the player during the first few hours. The vague context of the game takes a little away from the experience. (If it wasn't for google, I would still be clueless what the story was.)  Tori's abilities feel extremely limited at the start. While you do learn about the environment and its interactions, it feels like Tori doesn't 'grow' for an extensive period of time. (A lack of reward) Moreover, the game is extremely unique and may feel uncomfortable to people who wants comfort in what they are used to. (Toki Tori 1 or most puzzle games) Chirping melodies also seem like a very important feature used to solve puzzles. (but it isn't, it's the interaction a chirp does)ConclusionThis is the one of the few puzzle games I have played that uses inductive reasoning skills. It is not a game for everyone. Expect nothing of its predecessor (or most puzzle games for the matter) as your mind will be pushed into a different way of thinking. That said, Toki Tori 2 is in a genre of its own. If you have an open mind, you will probably love this.Personally my favourite puzzle game of all time, more so than Portal 2. (and that was amazing)Things I wished the game told you:1. The teleporting eagle could've been introduced earlier in the game.2. Using the rewind melody on a checkpoint brings you back to a previous checkpoint and can be used repeatedly within the area.3. Do not attempt to bring all shiny orange frogs into the tunnel BEFORE entering the city on the first playthrough.4. ""We will be making Toki Tori 3 as sales for Toki Tori 2 is off the charts!""Short Review+++++ Left me with the best experience I have ever had in a puzzle game.++++ Marry me class of level design++++ Marry me class of game design+++ Finding the many secrets in the game++ Nice difficulty curve that gets extremely complex+ Peaceful music+ Pleasant graphics (apart from the blue birds)+ No glitches as far as I can see.+ Comes with a Tokidex+ Being forced to watch Toki Tori drown+ Being crushed+ Being electrocuted+ Crushing little fruits+ Gets to witness a massacre++ Worth every dollar - It's a steal during sales (hard heads will not enjoy this)++++++++++++++++ Satisfaction of electrocuting and crushing the blue birds.- Lack of a clear purpose.- The huge paragraph above with regard to the pacing in the beginning.- Can be frustrating. (If you choose not to head to the 'main path' and gather knowledge of all tutorial hints)- Some puzzles are too tedious and unforgiving.- There is a certain area that seem possible to access with the surrounding props but isn't.--Blue birds.. those.. blue birds.---- Blue birds #$%^&*			",85,49,0,11,4,0,10

												Tl;dr version;* Toki Tori 1 piques your mind wondering how to solve this puzzle, and makes you feel rather good once you finally solve it.* Toki Tori 2+ piques your mind wondering what the developers where thinking.* Toki Tori 1 is fun trying to solve puzzles and complete them.* Toki Tori 2+ is wondering when it's starting to get fun; and it never gets there.Conclusion; If you want a game where the fun is puzzling out puzzles get Toki Tori 1. If you want a game where you want to  wonder where the fun went, buy Toki Tori 2+Long description;Toki Tori 1 was a bit of a surprise to me how much fun it was. I didn't really expect to get hooked on a puzzle game, not generally my thing. Even if it was relative simple, with a short amount of items, the puzzles were usually engaging, making you think, and making you feel good about yourself once you finally figure them out. Or feel stupid if you can't and YouTube them and then go ""Oh, that was the sollution. How could I not see that?""All in all; it's good fun.Which makes it all the more baffling what went wrong during the development of Toki Tori 2+* Instead of expanding the game, they took almost everything out. You only got 2(!) commands now. Z and X (stomp and make noise) which you need to solve ALL puzzles. Does 2 buttons for puzzles seem too shallow? Then you would be right, since it is. Instead of TT1 where you felt good solving the puzzle laid out before you here you simply need to do the command the developers want you to do, since there's not much more with 2 commands. Puzzles (like the frog and bubble) get repeated ad infentum. Instead of puzzling all you need to do is manipulate the environment, which isn't all that difficult since you only got 2 buttons to do stuff. To add injury to insult instead of large areas as TT1 TT2 decides to hugely zoom in. The result? That you never get complex large puzzles, but small compact instances. If you're ""stuck"" it never takes long since everything you need is within your small screen. It may take a small time to figure out, say, more fireflies bind together to make more light. But you can be guaranteed once you solve it the game will throw it 30 more times at you to make sure you remember what Z and X are on your keyboard. So instead of making your brain think, you simply follow the simple commands to allow the game to move you on. Away goes almost all the TT1 fun. But it gets worse.* For some reason levels weren't good enough, so we now got an ""open world"". Why? I don't know. You still follow level after level, but thanks to a map which is useless and doesn't show in any way where the levels are you pretty much wonder where the heck you're going. The map/levels branch too. I have no idea why, since it adds tedious backtracking, and a wonderement where to go next. Why? Because nothing is interesting at all. Do I need to go left or right for the game to start getting fun, to actually get somewhere? Nope... you just follow level after level of pointlessness, purpose-less and boring. Other games might actually make this pointless moving forward interesting with a plotline, cutscenes, rewards... ANYTHING, but not this game... it's just moving forward and forward into a meaningless pointlessness, not even worth exploring like say The Elder Scrolls since the world while cute isn't interesting *at all*. You can also forget looking forward to new mechanics, you keep Z and X'ing forever. Environmental stuff changes, but it never really feels any different than the very first puzzle you came across.It's not a good thing when a game makes you wonder ""why am I even playing this?""Finally, I got somewhere that I got a song to take pictures of animals. Why I have no clue still, but after I was done with it I suddenly got teleported to the useless map screen and had to point at a glowing pillar many many levels back. That pretty much was it... it was boring to go through content once, what makes them think I would even want to go through it twice? Why the heck can't that bird get me back to where I was... why even.You know what, my 3rd Steam card just dropped. I don't care anymore... take your game. I'll go back to Toki Tori 1 to have fun. Since no way in hell will I retrack to where I used to be through the same pointless ""puzzles"" that bored me to death this first 1 hour.I have no idea where they went off so badly that they produced such a pointless, dull and uninteresting game, that while cute, lacks any depth what-so-ever. And for a puzzle-game, that's killing.Many people want sequels to be different, to not be more of the same. I would say the same. But Toki Tori 2+ completely missed the mark in this respect. A missed opportunity. Oh well, atleast we got the first game...			",1380,705,33,177,158,15,228

												When I first saw this I though it was just some cutesy kids game, it's actually a cleverly designed puzzle platformer.The interesting thing is they never explicitly explain how to do anything, you learn by observation and experimentation.You never get any more powerful, what increases is your knowledge of how things work.It has moments of frustration followed by moments of clarity when everything suddenly become obvious.It's those epiphanies which really make the experience satisfying, and make you feel smart.My only criticism is I would have liked a tiny amount of exposition just to say who I was and what I was doing.

												Unique and UnderratedFrom all the puzzle games I have played (2D and 3D), this is the only one Ive seen that instead of giving you many tools, items, and/or powerups to progress, it just gives you 2 basic actions but with the ability to interact with the world and its creatures in hundreds of different ways. Also, its up to the player to think how the mechanic works, and feels extremely rewarding when you figure out the solutions by yourself. That : Aha! , or Eureka! moment you get after a long time thinking how to interact with your surroundings and solve a puzzle just makes me feel super good. I wasnt going to play this game because I thought it was just more of toki tori 1, and I didnt like the first game's casual, closed level design. This one is an interactive open world 2d puzzle platformer. If Two Tribes have gotten a better publisher, Im pretty sure this game would have sold way better. Its a gem.			",161,96,2,18,6,1,14

												Let me present you one of my favourite games and a very underrated title.TOKI TORI 2+ is different from anything else played before in similar genres.You'll need to figure out how to use and combine the 'tools' given at the beginning, because nobody is going to tell you - and I found this an amazing idea.I don't think this is a game for kids - despite the cute graphics - since some puzzles are really hard to solve. Great soundtrack, relaxing atmosphere.Seriously, the soundtrack works perfectly here.If you love the Myst series as I do, you're going to love this.If you love cheery/colorful platforms, you're going to love this.Forget the first Toki Tori, this is totally another experience. :]			",36,75,1,4,5,0,5

												I really liked the first Toki Tori so I bought Toki Tori 2+ at full price when it was first released.Unfortunately the changed the game a lot, and none of the changes are for the better. The viewpoint is now very zoomed in so you can't see much on the screen at one time. Puzzles aren't as interesting. The interface, which in the first game was simple and effective, is now very cumbersome. For many many you have to chirp several notes in a certain pattern. Dumb idea. Not worth it at any price.

												Toki Tori 2+ is so much more different than the first game. There's still puzzles but the main focus seems to be exploration and collecting items. The controls are simple, directional movement, chirp and stomp. Two actions but, surpirsingly, the game is mechanically deep. Not a lot is explained and it's all up to the player to figure out how to navigate the world. The puzzles are straightforward in the beginning and get more difficult as you progress. You may get stuck more than a few times especially if you're going for 100% completion.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes simple but challenging puzzle games. See how much you can manage without a guide. There's a lot to do and no hand-holding.			",106,24,1,4,11,1,8

												pros: they changed the game mechanic from the previous 'collect eggs' & maneuvering around the level - into a sing & stomp puzzler, beautiful art style, soundtrack fits the theme (although not as good as the first game), environment is reactive to your actions, steam workshop supportedcons: although there are some visual cues - there is no tutorial or objective instructions (which could result in a player getting lost & confused in what you are supposed to do), no mouse support for the world map, no windowed fullscreen mode, can't customize controls, huge difficulty spikes on some puzzles (would often require an online walkthrough to save time in solving tedious tasks)Overall, this is a lot more open world than the first game but to the detriment of the player, there are times where you would get lost & stumped on solving the puzzles. The new mechanics are great but with a flawed implementation. If you want an extreme trial & error, time consuming, tedious tasks of a puzzle game this is it. Otherwise...Toki Tori 2 is a hit or miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it looks like a game for kids, it's actually a deviously challenging puzzler that respects the player's intelligence and rewards exploration in a way very few games do.At the core of the game lies a metroidvania-style interconnected world with several ways to reach most locations, but unlike actual metroidvanias, there are no artificial barriers requiring special abilities. The only thing stopping you from breaking away from the main path and climbing a seemingly unreachable area is lack of knowledge on how to combine the level's resources to get there -  knowledge that you will pick up in the process of solving simpler puzzles, or figure out yourself using common logic and a little creativity. As a result, the game has very little backtracking for a Metroidvania world, unless you consciously choose to skip harder puzzles and come back later.The player  is only given two abilities, both unlocked from the start, and no inventory. This very limited toolkit is nonetheless used to create very challenging puzzles, even when all the elements are present on screen. Many puzzles misdirect the player with elements that play no part in the solution, or require ""smuggling out"" elements from other puzzles.There are no tutorials and no handholding, the game has no text whatsoever. You learn how to interact with game elements and make them interact with each other by experimenting and solving puzzles where figuring out the interaction is the only way to proceed forward. Figuring out the game's mechanics is the main puzzle.The art style may not be unique, but it is not low-effort by any means - it is clean, crisp and a pleasure to look at. The background for most levels are simply wonderful.Last but not least, most the Steam achievements actually add value to the game and serve as puzzles themselves.----This game is a crazy bargain for the price even when not on sale, and I would recommend it to anyone seeking a laid back but well-designed brain tickler.

												I fail to see any reason why this game should be considered metroidvania style. All that the character can do is move left and right plus sing and stomp. The character doesn't really acquire new abilities (at least it didn't in my 80 minutes of gameplay). The chicken does learn some songs but those don't deepen the gameplay or widen levels like is usual in metroidvanias.Because the movement and action is so reduced, consist all puzles from walking to a certain place and sing/stomp and from there walking to a another place and sing/stomp. Positive thing is the form of the puzzles: instead of usual flip a switch or step on a pressure plate puzzles, most of the puzzles consist guiding and manipulating animals. Usually interaction with animals follows formula: singing atracts and stomping scares. How and why singing and stomping should be used differs with every animal.The biggest problem I had with the game was my metroidvania expectations. I waited something more similar to the first Rayman, which has new skills that widened old levels. In this form I found puzzles of the Toki Tori 2+ quickly boring and after a level is complete, are new aspects of the next level usually quite minor. If Toki Tori 2+ had one or two new animals (puzzle elements) in every level, it might maintain its initial novelty. Another thing that was quite of for a metroidvania was tempo. The character is a fat bird and that gives quite good picture. There aren't really any enemies in a usual sense. They should be considered more like obstacles, like in any other situation with animals. These obstacles are game's so called puzzles. From this it follows that each level could be divided into countable number of separate puzzles (obstacles). Because of this kind of world structure and the crippled movement, for me, the game seemed like a classic Mario game where instead of jumping Mario could only pull or push boxes. There wouldn't be a problem if puzzles were interesting and challenging and there weren't too long gaps between them. Getting forward and completing levels should be much more rewarding than it is now. In essence: combination of level design and gameplay lacks feeling. I'll admit that my playtime is quite low and the game could get better as it goes on, but for me to find game enjoyable this would require occurrence of some major gameplay or level design changing element. Even if game had more to offer later, it wouldn't erase the fact that I found early game very tedious.If Toki Tori 2+ interests you and you consider buying the full game, I'll higly recommend trying the demo and then think if my critique could have had any base.

												This game is really awesome. It truly has a metroidvania style, with a map connecting all the puzzles. And the controls are simple, since Toki Tori only has 3 actions: movement, chirp and stomp. So, how can this simplicity lead to challenging puzzles? The answer is the environment. There are a lot of creatures and other mechanisms, and each one has unique abilities. You must figure out how to use and combine them to advance. And here lies the beauty of exploring this game. In metro-style games, you advance the map and find blocked areas, because you don't have the gadget or ability yet. Then you keep exploring, find them and backtrack. Here, those zones are always accessible. But you may not know how to progress, so you keep playing and discovering new ways to interact with the environment. And then you backtrack and solve those zones, knowing that it was possible to go there from the beginning. The map may not be huge, but there are lots to do. To beat the story, you need to find 5 special frogs. You can collect all wings to uncover new secrets. And there are hidden zones and achievements. Oh, and the art is amazing too. And the game doesn't feel like some puzzles connected to each other by a map. Here, the total is more than the sum of it's parts. And that makes this game truly special and rewarding to explore.

												A marvelous example of a puzzle game that teaches you its mechanics organically, without a single tutorial. Just pay attention, and you'll figure it out. It's also a somewhat open-world game, so if you feel too smart, you can take a detour and go basically anywhere, but I'd recommend that for a second walkthrough, cause you'll miss the plot twists and a lot of the content.

												Just finished with this game yesterday, took a little longer than expected since i never thought to use the ""locate collectibles"" song whilst on the map screen (despite there being a bird singing the tune on that screen throughout the game).I figured i'd address certain issues people have brought up.First off, difficulty:The puzzles that lead to the credits aren't too tough, its the ones that take you off the main path that can be difficult. These are hidden by using the available animals in different ways than the main puzzles, or adding extra steps to the solutions to go further than the normal exit. Easier examples include having a bird grab you from a different location than its starting location so that it takes a different path to its drop off point. Harder ones usually involve safely escorting creatures outside of their normal wandering zones so you can use them to move to unexpected locations.Secondly, getting around:Almost every 'screen' in the game has an object that you can use a song to teleport to them from any checkpoint in the game. You can rewind to a previous checkpoint using a song that is taught at a couple of early-game dead-end locations. This means you can always return to a checkpoint to use the teleport song but undoes everything done after touching the checkpoint, this includes collecting collectibles or any animal movement.The majority of areas have also have small mole tunnels that open up once you've visited both sides of them to help you get around easier, these are typically located in zones that have complicated or lengthy puzzles to travel through them.... I thought i would have a ""thirdly"" here but there isn't much more to address. Go figure, its beautiful, buy it, have fun, heres a few more screenshots http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawrsume/screenshots/?appid=201420&sort=newestfirst&view=imagewall ",672,137,12,60,31,5,63

												Fun and not very easy puzzle gamePros:- Nice colorful graphics- Different types of obstacles/enemies- Nice varying puzzle designsCons- ""Toki Tori 2+ is a Metroidvania style puzzle adventure."" false advertising, this is not a Metroidvania, how your character is when game starts is how your character is when game ends- Can be a little frustrating sometimes. Esepcially when you already figured out the solution to a puzzle but you keep making a small error near the end of execution and you have to start over. This is okay in action games but this is a 100% puzzle game.			",134,25,0,10,3,1,16

												This is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. It is up there with Braid in terms of quality, but quite different. It's like the Super Mario World of puzzle games with a large, living world that is full of surprises if you explore enough. If you are a puzzle game fan, you should play this game.

												It does what it does really well, however i do not like what it does lol. Everyone says that part of the game is figuring out how to do things, which if you like having to figure out how to make your character do something with no hints clues or suggestions than yea not a problem. However i did not realize this prior to booting the game up. With that said i will give it two rankings to be fair.         If figuring out how to do something does not bother you, than this game gets a solid 85 in my opinion.         If however figuring out how to do things is a chore and causes you to get stuck forever than i give this game a 70.The art is great, game runs smooth, no glitches that i am aware of..... The puzzles themselves are for the most part good, the music..... it is good but not my style, but with this type of game just play your own background music. In both instances wait until it goes on sale if it interest you.And you do get what you see in the videos.			",53,11,1,8,4,0,3

												If you enjoy puzzle platformers and prefer exploration vs. being hand-fed what to do through immersion-breaking tutorials, you will love Toki Tori 2+.The game is remarkably charming and cute, with nice aesthetics and relaxing music. When you first load the game, you will immediately be dropped into actual gameplay as a baby chick bird - with no tutorials of any sort. There was a part right in the beginning where I had to actually check the control layout, however, I was okay with this because there are very few controls to begin with. After continuing, the title ""Toki Tori 2+"" rises up as you make your way to the other side of the map. I found that to be a very refreshing intro to a game.The learning curve for this game is very minimal, as the puzzles do a great job of progressing in difficulty at a reasonable pace - you will always be aware of what mechanic you need to be using by the time you get to the more difficult variations. Trial and error is also convenient because of the very few controls you have at your disposal.You can't jump in the game, however, you can stomp or sing - and either action usually has an effect on your environment. For example, frogs will orient themselves toward you if you sing, and (if they eat a small animal) they will release a bubble if you stomp. If you are hit by the frog's bubble, it will carry you up and either to the left or right (depending on the frog's orientation) until a short distance has passed or until you stomp. In order to help feed the frog (sometimes its food is not on the same plane), you need to stomp when the prey is near the edge of a ledge, which will cause it to fall to a lower level.Later, you will unlock special notes that you can sing in order to activate abilities like ""rewind"" (I was not expecting a mechanic like this and was pleasantly suprised). You can manipulate your singing by changing the timing of your spacebar presses, and using rewind will return you to a previous checkpoint you have activated (gold totem-like objects). The game map is fairly extensive, with many forks in the road to keep you engaged and challenged. There are also gold puzzle pieces and other things for you to collect.Highly recommend for puzzle platform enthusiasts.			",250,87,0,51,38,2,49

												Toki Tori 2 is, rather obviously, the sequel to Toki Tori. It's evolved from being a pure puzzle game, with limited use of items, to a more fluid platformer puzzle. While the original was pretty unforgiving, and often required surgically precise steps to solving the puzzles, TT2 isn't quite as strict. Most puzzles can be re-attempted without a reset or winding back time.In TT2, you return as Toki Tori, and you only have two (unlimited) abilities at your disposal : a whistle, and a ground stomp. There are many other creatures and elements in the game, and they will respond to one, oftentimes both, of these actions. Puzzles are solved by using your abiltiies to manipulate your surroundings. It sounds very simple, but there are many, many different creatures in the game, and the trickier puzzles will require chaining their reactions together. The 'core' puzzles that you need to solve to progress through the game are fairly straightforward, but the side area ones are much tougher, and it always feels very satisfying to finally solve them and hear the bonus area background chime.There are several good points to this game that I want to highlight.1) It doesn't try to babysit you. The game provides subtle hints to guide you along, but it lets you learn it without butting in obstrusively. The game itself starts off without any kind of narration, and you're left to make your way through the levels. In fact, the only help text I ever remembered seeing, was the hint to sing the Reset song, and even that only appears after you fail to follow the non textual clue. The effect of this is that it increases the immersion of the game, and makes solving the levels so much more rewarding.2) No need to constantly run to an ingame menu. Instead, Toki Tori can whistle a certain combination of notes to perform certain actions (e.g. reset to last checkpoint or go to the world map). It's a very nice touch.3) You don't get any new abilities as you progress (with the exception of the songs, but those don't factor into the puzzzles). This means there's no grinding involved. All puzzles are solvable right from the beginning of the game, but on your first try you won't know how. You'll learn several tips and tricks as you go along, and when you backtrack to the earlier to fulfill your masochistic desire to collect all the score items, it will suddenly strike you that you can get one frog to float another frog up.4) Graphics and music. The art style is very minimalistic, clean and ridiculously cute, and the music fits the game very well. For the most part, it's a relaxing experience, in spite of all the puzzle solving.As with most platformers, it plays much better with a controller.Highly recommended.			",93,41,0,24,14,0,28

												I love Toki Tori. So I hoped that Toki Tori 2+ is just more of the same. First part was sequence of challenging puzzles (some of them were really hard). Toki Tori 2+ has “open world” and exploration elements. Puzzles are about interaction with environment. You are using other animals and terrain to reach secret object or to find you way to next objective. There are some really hard optional puzzles, however the mandatory ones are way too easy to solve. The hardest part is to figure out what exactly the chicken can do (e. g. wet chicken will drop water and dropping water can grow grass). Overall I like the game, it is very cute and solving puzzles is fun. Utilization of my brain is nowhere near original game, still some thinking is required.  ",122,45,0,14,5,1,16

Playing this game took every ounce of courage I had, as it slowly sucked my essence to feed whatever maelstrom of darkness rages behind the deceptively innocent facade. Fun for ages 6 to 666.

												+ It's beautiful and cute.+ Thanks to amazing game design, puzzles are never frustrating for long. The game is non-linear after the first 20%, so you can finish it taking the route you want (though a specific route is suggested to ensure a progressive difficulty curve). If you're stuck, you can still go to another place of the map, you may learn there a trick that will help you find the solution to your initial problem. You'll be sure not to waste time, since side tracks that aren't necessary to finish the game are always pretty short, and are filled with collectibles.+ Not a single word outside the menus and the credits! You learn everything you need through puzzles.+ The game is cuuute!+ You won't have to inspect every square centimeter of the levels to find the secrets. The game gives you a tool to detect the collectibles, so your only problem will be how to get to them (via, you guessed it, a puzzle!).+ Did I mention this game is cute? ⋋(^3^)⋌- Such cuteness seems to be pretty ressource-intensive, especially the litghting. In places where several lighting effects were taking place, the game often lagged despite my pretty good equipment. Never was a problem for the gameplay though.⋛⋋( ‘◇’)⋌⋚  May the birds be with you!  ⋛⋋( ‘◇’)⋌⋚/|\( ;,; )/|\  Watch out for bats!  /|\( ;,; )/|\			",53,16,1,6,4,0,2

												I'm definitely in a minority here:  I didn't much care for Toki Tori 2+.  Yes, the graphics are nice.  But, I played for more than two hours and still hadn't even figured out what the point was.  The write-up for the game is:""There are no tutorials, there's no hand-holding, no-one tells you what to do in Toki Tori 2+. The fun is in exploring and overcoming the obstacles of the lush forest island on your own merit. ""And, yes, that's true.  But, an implication of what constitutes a win-state and what the mechanics are would be nice.  I probably could have lived with the ""fun [of] exploring and overcoming the obstacles..."" if I didn't have to remember several stupid songs as a tool to do things.  I'm lucky to remember what day of the week it is.  Remembering a song for certain vital activities is just a pain.			",77,70,0,12,8,0,3

												Toki Tori 2+ is a cute sequel which is also more open. The puzzles range from easy to 'i have no clue'. Having never finished the first game I don't know if the puzzles are actually harder, or more clever,... or easier.Toki Tori isn't a fast chick, he's quite slow actually, which also influences the gameplay. If only he walked a little bit faster. The game is so slow and uneventful that I had to play it in sessions of 10-30 minutes. After 2-3 hours of total playtime I had no more interest in finishing it. I doubt I will ever finish it in the first place.You might enjoy it however so if you loved the first one you'll love this one, too. I'm sure of it.[Rating: 72/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												I really REALLy wanted to like this game, I thought it was a fun idea, the visuals were crisp and the focus was just on solving puzzles. Unfortunatley, it just left me feeling like it was missing something. Maybe it was a lack of direction, maybe it was a good map or saving system, or maybe it was the combination that left me alone, in a dead end, with no way out except electrocution. Whatever it was, it left me feeling really disappointed. This game just seemed to miss the mark.			",45,40,1,18,2,0,3

												There's like no words. I guess I'm doing stuff by collecting these jingos and putting various special frogs in portals and filling up unlocks on some door? I found a disco!Every action the fat bird can do is ""unlocked"" from the get-go, so almost all locks are in our heads as players. I'd go back and I find I could short out slugs by buttstomping wet to short them out, turning a seeming roadblock a new passage.Everything you do comes from chirping or buttstomping and it still leads to these supercomplex puzzles.There's all this wierd allusions to dark-and-or-silly stuff as you bumble around solving your way thru the gameworld.It is THE learn-by-doing game, up there with Valve or Nintendo on this.I think the only thing I don't truly cotton to is the occasional fidgety puzzle (the controls could stand to be a bit more analog), but that's all I can think of.

												You may think that this game is for kids only, but if you think so, then you are clearly wrong. I am not really a big fan of puzzle games, however I have once gotten a discount card (or whatever those things are called) and the trailers looked pretty promising, so I grabbed it, and I do not regret it. Every level is thought out very nicely and I love how the game combines a platformer with a 2D map which lets you go in many different directions, while still being a 2D platformer. The graphics are really cute and so is the soundtrack and the puzzles have just the right difficulty. While not being so easy that you don't have to use your brain they are also not so hard that you give up and never play again. I can only recommend this game, especially if you have someone else to solve the puzzles together (in my case a younger sister). Honestly, I have not been as addicted to a game in a very long time, if you are standing on the edge of whether or not you should buy this game; if you have someone else to play together with, then buy it.

												I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Toki Tori 2+. Although admittedly it took a little bit to start appreciating the game. This is primarily due to the lack of instructions or direction provided by the game. There are no tutorials, no dialog, nothing. What the game does do to help the player is provide subtle hints, that I personally missed at first. For example, always pay attention to the little white bird. He will show you how to get to certain areas and even show you song melodies that you can play to do certain things (e.g. fast travel, restart, point out collectibles). Although this lack of direction made starting out a little tough, I ended up appreciating it later on.What I really enjoyed about the game is how it takes such a simple concept and is able to make complex puzzles. Throughout the entire game, you can only move (not jump), stomp the ground, and make tweeting sounds. You must use these abilities to interact with different animals and objects in order to solve puzzles. From the beginning of the game, you have the ability to get to any area. The only thing you might be lacking is the knowledge of how to get past certain points. Again, the game does not tell you how to do things with dialog boxes, instead it subtly shows you, through gameplay, how to use your stomping and tweeting to progress through the level.I strongly suggest checking out this video walkthrough for when you get stuck, and you most certainly will. You may have to hunt through the videos to find where he covers the section you are stuck on, but it is definitely worth it as he shows how to unlock all of the achievements and shows some stuff that I would not have been able to figure out on my own.Another helpful tip is that the rewind song, which is: (tweet these notes) short short long long, can be played multiple times to jump back to previous checkpoints.

												The developers put a lot of time and effort into making the main game fun and challenging whilst also catering to both pro's and inexperienced players via its use of the open world system which has more challenging paths for those who want a more difficult puzzle, and if the 12-15 hours of gameplay in the main game isn't enough for you then the endless number of levels that you can create or download from other users via the steam workshop will add as many hours as you can imagine to extend the gameplay of this.  I would say it is a worthwhile purchase for anyone who likes a good puzzle game as the puzzles are both unique but also rewarding for solving them yourself and if you get stuck, well theres always other paths you can take around the island.

												I think this game is really fun. At first i just expected it to be another one of those games where you solve puzzles. But no, it tells a really cool storyline and its just fun. one thing that i like to do on it is just admire all of the wonderful creatures in volcanoes, waterfalls, caves, and pretty much anywhere. also Tokidex, is obviously from something else. you'll know what it is.

												+ Nice graphics+ Good animations+ Good sound effects- There's no storyline. You'll proceed level by level, and your question is: ""Where am i going? And, more important, why this bird is doing all this?""- Level design is surely repetitive and has no kind of originality- No clues about how to resolve the puzzles. And, more important, most of puzzles are made to be solved only by their creators. A game MUST be resolved be common people, not by incredible geniuses! Too frustrating!			",84,9,0,3,2,1,4

												The developers put a lot of time and effort into making the main game fun and challenging whilst also catering to both pro's and inexperienced players via its use of the open world system which has more challenging paths for those who want a more difficult puzzle, and if the 12-15 hours of gameplay in the main game isn't enough for you then the endless number of levels that you can create or download from other users via the steam workshop will add as many hours as you can imagine to extend the gameplay of this.  I would say it is a worthwhile purchase for anyone who likes a good puzzle game as the puzzles are both unique but also rewarding for solving them yourself and if you get stuck, well theres always other paths you can take around the island.

												It's the best 2D platformer I have played recently, and for the price it is, I would say go for it. You have 2 abilities, a sing, and a short little ground pound. You have to rely on using these to manipulate the environment in different ways to get you around. It's a really creative little game, and easily worth picking up. I haven't played Toki Tori 1 but I really want to now.			",96,15,7,6,7,0,4

												If you like cutesie puzzle platform type games then this is certainly the game for you! It makes use of some interesting game mechanics. You can't jump, but you can ""tweet"" up to 5 notes, each of which can be either short or long, and you can pound on the ground. During the game you learn different sequences of notes that cause different magical effects (sort of like a bird casting magic spells by tweeting the right way). So rather than the usual platformer type stuff of killing things with weapons or Mario-style by landing on them, or getting around by jumping, you have to use tweeting and ground pounding to manipulate your environment in order to progress. And there's even a level editor for the thing.This style of game isn't really my main area of interest, but this game is extremely well designed and is quite unique. If this is your type of game, then this one would be in the must get category.			",187,46,3,39,37,1,35

												Really boring game, I read that I should do a bit more tilt it goes much fun, but it simply doesnt, seriously, put that coupon that you got from buying EDGE and give it to some else to troll them to buy boring♥♥♥♥♥♥and hate you xD. The game just have 2 actions (apart from movement), it REALLY lacks gameplay and thats what in my opinion makes de game really boring. I passed the first 2 levels like it was a mario bros for SNES, its suppose to be puzzle but the difficulty doesnt show it right from the bat and also make it really boring. Totally fails at engage the audience to play it at the very beginning. Unless some kid like 6-10 MIGHT like it but if you are a hardcore gamer like me (or a veterean that have 20 years and still dont give a f*** about keep playing videogames) you will want something with more mechanics and more open gameplay which this game on particular really lacks.

												This is easily one of the best puzzle games, let alone puzzle platformer games, out there, especially for its pricepoint. The level design is consistently solid and new elements and new ways to utilize existing elements are constantly introduced without ever breaking the flow of gameplay and without feeling the slightest bit handholdy. There is an immense sense of discovery to every aspect of the game as shortcuts and hidden paths are constantly present and it is up to the player to decide where to go and to discover how to best use everything the game presents them with. The game also does a great job of adjusting to the player's skill level (or the player's desired difficulty) as there is always a clear path to take, but harder, hidden routes through the game's world are ever-present for players who wish to discover all that this game has to offer.With its excellent sense of physical and mechanical exploration and puzzles which range from fairly easy to outright diabolical, Toki Tori 2+ is a game which puzzle fans should leap at the chance to play as soon as they can.

												Great game in what can be called an ""openworld puzzle"" genre.Fun, calm and pretty.No text needed. You learn mechanics just by experiencing themThe abilities you have in the beginning don't change (well, and don't need to change) during the game. Only your knowledge expands as you do harder and harder puzzles.The main course of the game is relatively average in difficulty (gearing up from easy to hard puzzles), but there's also a lot of hardcore stuff to do if you're into it.Worshop - community levels - sounds like a great thing for this kind of game too.

												If you're a Toki Tori 1 fan, Beware; This is not like the original. My record shows that I've played this for 20 mins, but I downloaded it from Humble Bundle and I've put about 3 hours into it. During that 3 hours I never reached that level of fun that Toki Tori 1 gave me. They reinvented a game that didn't need it by making it an open world, metroidvania type game. If this is your first Toki Tori game, go ahead and buy it, but for those that really loved Toki Tori 1 like I did, I sadly cannot recommend it.			",47,16,1,1,3,0,7

												It's a yes and no from me. The game quickly gets very cryptic and frustrating. The puzzles are unwieldy and unrealistically intricate. This is even beyond NES games cryptic & difficult. You're 3 hours in before you even unlock the simplest of achievements.Don't misunderstand me, I complain about games being too easy these days, and they are, often insultingly so, but this is the other end of the scale... this is something AVGN will be playing sometime in the future. There's a lot to love about this game in the graphics and music, that side of the game came together very nicely, but the puzzle element is missing a touch of vital communication to glue the whole thing together and make it enjoyable as well as challenging and rewarding.

												I didn't like Toki Tori 2+ at all its nothing like the first one, and it isnt metroidvania at all either. Its more like Super Mario Bros 3 except the world map is pointless since it just takes you back to the last level. I was even perplexed within the first few minutes of playing, it didnt really feel like a puzzle game to me. If you want an awesome idea of what a good puzzle platformer would play like check out Moei Kun for the Famicom or like The Violinist of Hamelin on Super Famicom and that is more of a side scroller with puzzle elements but the game play mechanics make sense for a side scroller this doesn't, its just weird its like it couldnt decide if it wanted to be a puzzler or a mario like game. I liked Toki Tori 1 cause I thought it was kind of like Moei Kun somewhat but probably not as good though since the old school real Konami made Moei Kun			",151,15,1,17,0,0,0

												The controls are almost too simple (only two buttons are used but they do tons of different things). Puzzles are very vague and hard to follow. You'll need a guide... good luck finding a complete one. Navigation is confusing and awful due to the game being one huge map, rather than individual levels. The most unsatisfying ""ending"" everAdditional Notes:Just like every game I play, I make it a commitment to finish the game all the way through. Of course, I finished this (despite this game's flaws), and my achievements are proof of that. Toki Tori 2 just has so many fundamental design problems making it a title I cannot recommend to anyone. It pains me to see how disappointing this ended up being since it looked like it really could of been something special. I feel bad for the developers, and I hope their final game manages to pull them back up to greatness.			",168,58,2,14,8,3,18

												It's sort of like a puzzle version of a Metroidvania game. You tweet/chirp and stomp to make different things happen in the environment to get you around. You learn different tweet/chirp tunes to do things like rewinding time, etc. It looks cute, which is nice, and the music was pretty decent. However, I couldn't find any semblance of a story, or an objective. There are little spinning things to collect, but I didn't find a use for them and there wasn't a counter to tell me how many I had or if I'd gotten all of them from the level I'd finished. The world map has that sort of Super Mario World aesthetic, but you can't seem to actually move around on the map. It's just like ""Yep, you're going to this place. Press Z"" and that's it. Anyway, it's not a bad game from what I can tell, but without some sense of purpose, either from a plot or from a completionist point of view, I can't recommend it and doubt I'll ever finish it.

												I was fooled into buying this game by the reviews. I love Metroidvania games, and this is not a metroidvania game.The genre consists of a hero who runs around and fights monsters in an open ended world where progress is earned by finding new items that unlock new paths. Toki tori 2+ is is a linear series of simplistic puzzles that center on stomping next to animals to scare them.You play as a big yellow bird that can move around in a colorful world filled with cute animals, and you can interact with the world by singing and stomping. The stomping causes different kinds of animals to react differently. By scaring the right animals to do the right thing (usually eating another animal) you may advance to the next puzzle. If this was all there was to the game I would still feel cheated as it is no metroidvania, but it's a fun enough puzzle game where the player gets to explore a pretty world by solving simple puzzles.What kills the enjoyment for me is  the singing. It is a candidate for the most stupid game mechanic ever - basically there is a single button for singing. Pressing the button ""rapidly"" causes the bird to sing at a higher and higher pitch, and pressing it ""slowly"" causes the pitch to drop. The idea being that you run into birds that sing a song, and you have to mimic it. Here I think a rapid press is anything below 100ms, and everything above that is a slow press, which means that at least I am unable to accurately enter anything, and when I press as fast as I can I am still mostly unable to produce the rising tones, and thus the singing really hurts my fingers and takes a really long time to get past due to the button mashing effectively being random. TL;DR cute little puzzle game, not a metroidvania like the liars claim. Could be fun for a while, but the singing kills any enjoyment. Only get if you hate yourself and wish to inflict physical pain on your fingers.			",391,226,9,80,45,3,82

												Im all for puzzle games, but some of these puzzles are just maddening. I've had to consult youtube a few times to figure out how to get past some areas, but only after being stuck 15 minutes. In once case I couldn't solve the puzzle because I didn't notice tiny splashes in the water, apparently I had to herd an INVISIBLE frog. I also once got a checkpoint in a dead-end setup and had to figure out how to fully reset the level in order to clear my bad checkpoint.			",111,18,2,8,13,0,10

												I have never tried the first game but I hope its better than the second one. Yes it is beautiful but there are many restrictions to where you can and cant go, there is repetition on every corner which makes puzzels boring after 20 minuets. Half the puzzels are so extensive you have to spend time looking them up. But on the good side it has an extended map which opens up as you play. Genrally not that great.			",9,4,0,0,2,0,1

												Toki Tori 2+, sequel of Toki Tori, a successful massively-multiplayer online FPS game, offers a completely new set in a dystopian future, with game mechanics and graphics from scratch made to reality using the brand-new Unreal Engine 4.Toki Tori 2+ now supports Steam Workshop for the upload of user-made deathmatch maps and character cosmetics such as hats or weapon skins.Similar to its prequel, the campaign still follows its lore: it's year 2039, and you are still the little bird with his dad with the instructions, from the Pentagon, to carry out an important, secret operation which will determine the faith of the United States of America and America itself, in a rather discreet way, of course without being noticed by the several militants set across every level: from Soviet soldiers to the occasional National socialist patrols, along with the potential ambushes from the Islamic State. In a condemned world, with blood-thirsty people, increased and costant civil wars, lethal infections spread around by the Korean Pact, with its leader Kimg Jong-bong.The game also offers a rather new and largely optimized co-op mode, with a maximum of 2 users, with costant support and even an in-game bonus in case bugs should occurr.I also highly recommend its DLC: Toki Tori 2+: War on Space, which is set in space in year 2038, giving an in-depth explanation of the new, last war.

												It's a fun game for kids aged 4-8 and is a nice puzzle solving game, but if your older than that you can definetly see nearly all puzzles instantly. It's a simple game that could feed your childly needs but for me i couldn't progress very far cause it really wasn't such an exciting game, i got bored nearly instantly, there is not really a challenge, you can't die and you only have 1 thing that looks like an attack where you smack yourself to the ground. I bought this game during a humble bundle sale and i just played a few days ago and for me it was such a laughable game, but hey, that's just me.

												Toki Tori 2+ is a Metroidvania style puzzle adventure. There are no tutorials, there's no hand-holding, no-one tells you what to do in Toki Tori 2+. The fun is in exploring and overcoming the obstacles of the lush forest island on your own merit. Our unlikely yellow hero may be the star of the show, but he won't get anywhere without the creatures he meets along the way. Armed with just the Whistle and Stomp moves, he can influence and make use of these strange creatures' unique abilities. But what's up with that black goo? It's threatening your home world! Your goal is to get to the core of the corruption and save the island!			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												Positives--Good soundtrack from what I heard in the 20 minutes I played of itNegtatives- -Very limited mechanics-Incredibly slow paced -Obnoxius easy puzzles-Terrible textures-Far to expensive for what you are gettingI wanted to like this game, I enjoy platformers so when this arrived in whatever humble bundle it was I thought I would give it a try but I just couldn't enjoy it I’m sorry, Toki tori 2 is dreadful compared to the amazing side-scrolling puzzle games on pc like Trine, Trine 2, Braid, Fez, Rayman Origins, Rayman legends, The Bridge, The Swapper and Rochard (just to name a few). I've honestly played IOS and flash games with more depth, bare in mind that IOS and flash games are usually free or very cheap and Toki Tori 2 costs £12 (that’s right £12 at this moment) so there is no excuse for limited mechanics and ugly textures. However I do have to mention that the game has a good soundtrack and the sound effects correspond perfectly to your actions but that isn't enough to make the game nearly enjoyable. The game is extremely slow paced and it mocks your intelligence with how easy the puzzles are so how can you possibly recommend this game unless you are completely delusional about this genre. I'm sorry but you can't justify paying £12 for this when Trine, Fez and Super Meat boy are all cheaper, maybe if you have played all decent the platformers on steam (which you probaly haven't) AND the game is on sale AND you have played the orginal and want some nostalga, then you MIGHT have a slight feasible reason to buy it.

												I loved Toki Tori and couldn't wait to get the 2+, but upon playing it surprised me. It's nothing like the first one!Besides that though, I've been pretty hooked on it off and on between larger games. It's fun to play and figure out the puzzles here and there and it's a solid game. They give you a limited set of commands for the entirity of the game, with no new moves being learned throughout. There's a small cutscene as the introduction and then off you go into the world!I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of puzzle games, or of lighthearted 'adventures'.

												This game is much more like Toki Tori 1 than Metroid or Castlevania, so ignore the ""metrodvania"" label. All Toki Tori 2+ is is a good puzzle game. Maybe not quite as good as Toki Tori 1, but even that is debatable. Don't expect just more of the same puzzles, either, because all of the base puzzle elements have been replaced, but the game is still completely solid.			",501,171,6,87,62,4,110

												Don't be fooled by it's colorful and child-like appearance. Toki Tori 2+ is awesome!Toki Tori 2+ will have you smiling ear-to-ear, as you play a fat little bird who sings and butt-slams his way through his colorful world.I haven't felt this platforming magic since playing Super Mario Bros 2 or Yoshi's Island. It is a patient side-scroller. There's no crazy jumps or wild enemies that you have to avoid. It keeps it simple by letting you explore, find treasure, and figure out how the world works with only a handful of actions. The visuals are really pretty. This is definitely a call-back to classic platforming.			",820,290,19,116,69,6,135

												Toki Tori 2+ is a fun puzzle game, which can be bought for pretty cheap on a sale. If you're on a Mac, though, you'll want to get a virtual machine with Windows on it for it to work. The graphics are nice, the characters are cute, and there are killer bats. I mean, killer bats, come on. I haven't played a lot of the game yet, so this isn't based off of a lot. Overall, if you like puzzle games, you'll probably like this one. 8/10(If you want to jump a lot, though, you may be slightly disappointed)			",42,6,0,1,5,0,1

												I recommend this game only for young children under 10 or even younger. The controls are easy to learn as you can only move sideways, up and down on ladders. You play a bird that can sing and stomp affecting the surrounding npc-s. For an adult it gets boring rather quickly, but this game is probably meant for children. I bought only because it was dirt cheap.It works well with the steam controller.			",90,24,1,10,13,0,25

												I initially hated this game.  A lot.  I had loved the first Toki Tori, but found this one frustrating and confusing.However, after having put it on the shelf for a year and coming back, I decided to give the game a real shot.  And after some initial frustration, I really started enjoying it.  The puzzles are really, really well thought out.  And only a few of them were what I'd call ""unfair"" and required levels of perception I seem to lack.But given lots of patience and time, it was very rewarding to figure out the puzzles, and finish a level.What I *do* ding the game for though is its lack of focus, and overall confusing storyline.  Nothing really made any sense whatsoever, and I never felt like I knew what I was doing, beyond just solving puzzles.  This game lacked a lot of the charm of the original, even though, as I mentioned, the puzzle design was freaking fantastic.I'm giving this a thumbs up, if you love puzzle games, and can ignore the confusing storyline.

												This game is pure genius.In a nutshell, you're a small egg-shaped chick, whose goal is... wait, what was its goal? No matter. You get thrown in the middle of a 2D side-scrolling world, with no tips or hints at all - you just walk to the right, and eventually find things as you walk, like more birds like you, gear pieces, or even the Toki Tori 2+ logo. All you can do (and you find out soon enough) is walk, whistle, and stomp on the ground. And that's all you will be able to do the entire game.Using just those skills, you will explore the world. A beautiful world, full of different and vivid kinds of landscapes. You will go through a path, it seems, eventually discovering diverse things about the world you suddenly got thrown on, facing countless innovative puzzles that you solve with just the abilities you have at your disposal - again, walking, whistling, and stomping. What you do not know is that it isn't only a path. And that you may actually go anywhere in the world, right at the same time you get thrown in it - you get no additional abilities. The only barrier preventing you from doing so is knowledge of how the different elements of the world work. This, itself, makes the game amazing.The core, of course, is in the puzzles - it's a puzzle-solving exploration game. The puzzles are very creative, yet not frustrating or particularly hard; you do not need to be an experienced puzzle-solver to be able to complete the entire game, without using a guide. The game may net you 15~25 hours of gameplay to complete fully, gameplay that you will enjoy to its fullest as you travel through the world of Toki Tori 2+.If you have an inchling of curiosity towards this game - perhaps you saw the beautiful screenshots, perhaps you played the original Toki Tori, perhaps you simply love puzzle games - and you are indecisive and this game is on sale, you should definitely give it a try. The world is even more gorgeous than what you see in the screenshots. The puzzles are much more creative than in the original. I have a hard time thinking of any game that has a similar concept to this one, and it's astoundingly well delivered. You will be surprised.			",58,27,2,19,7,1,5

												This is not a game for the faint of heart.Toki Tori 2 has perhaps the best game design of anything I've played recently. There is hardly any tutorializing, and each new section requires you to figure out how new mechanics work, or use existing mechanics in a way you hadn't thought of. Synthesizing the tiny bits of knowledge about how your stomp and whistling affect the environment into a working solution requires plenty of critical thinking, and I must admit I found the game frustrating for the longest time, because I was almost in a perpetual state of ""being stuck"" on every new puzzle I attempted.But the game made me feel incredible smart once I did figure how the world works and mastermind a series of actions to solve what are seemingly impossible puzzles. The solutions are never obvious, and more than often I found myself thinking, ""There's no way to solve this. ...Wait, is it possible for me to do XYZ? There's NO WAY that's the solution; that's far too devious."" And then it is.If you're looking for an incredibly well-made and difficult puzzle-platformer, whose difficulty springs from your ability to think rather than any inherent unfairness, well then my friend, this is a must-buy.

												Toki Tori 2 is an extraordinary game. You know how you're the kind of person who wants games that don't hold your hand? Games that assume you're intelligent instead of making you feel smart? You might not expect it, but Toki Tori 2 is that game. Its mechanics live in the plants and animals that inhabit its world; only through careful observation of these plants and animals can you progress through the puzzles. Figuring out how this world works and how you can work within it is one of the most rewarding experiences I've found in a puzzle game.			",431,178,11,67,59,5,88

												Toki Tori 2+ is a child friendly puzzler/platformer. I will start with this, if you are an adult then this game will stink. Its not for you, its for kids. I would say about under the ages 2-6. There is no violent death (that I have found at least) in the game (drowning was disturbing but no blood), its a relaxing fun exploration with zany (for kids) interactions with a magical world. Its about as wholesome as apple pie, and while I did get frustrated from some of the mechanics (birds that grab your guy) I doubt a kid wouldn't find this awesome/fun. The music is nice, the interactions are cute, Toki Tori is a polished gem in an industry that pumps out crappy kids games with no thought.TLDR; Get it for kids under the age of 7, no blood and easy puzzles with fun interactions. Past that age and its a boring kids game that I would say is borderline unplayable (for an adult).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great puzzle game with fantastic music and graphics, but more importantly, a really interesting progression style. Think 'the alien monkeys teaching you how to wall-jump' but for every action in the game. Some very clever puzzles.			",326,65,4,39,33,2,34

												Remember those animal things in Super Metroid that taught you how to shinespark? Toki Tori 2 is basically that moment but as a game. Unlike the first game, which was a puzzle game closer in heritage to Lemmings, Toki Tori 2 is an exploration puzzle platformer with zero in-game text and no ability gating. You have two ways of interacting with the world: stomping and, most interestingly, singing. By alternating long and short presses, Toki can sing big or small notes, respectively. Similar to the ocarina in Zelda games, different combinations of notes will have certain effects. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from using any of these ""powers"" from the start of the game. You could, in theory, brute force all of them on the opening screen, but that would take a while. The way the game teaches you these powers at the ""right time"" is through little birds that you'll see around the environment that sing little note combos. Copy these notes and BAM you'll learn what that combo does. There's only five or so powers, which was initially disappointing, but I realized that it would be much more challenging for the developers to fully explore the mechanics. And they've done a great job with that as it is. Admittedly, I'm only about halfway done with the game by my reckoning, but the variety I've seen in puzzle design and mechanical interaction has impressed me. Toki Tori 2 is one of the most surprising games of 2013 for me. I wasn't a huge fan of the first game, but Toki Tori 2 has blown me away with its well-designed environmental puzzles and storytelling. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a great puzzle game.			",385,110,11,52,38,4,59

												Buy It:This is another game that surprised me a lot, first of all because I didn't liked too much the way the chick looks like, and then because to me it looked like a boring game for children (and even the kids coul be bored to play at xD)I was wrong! It's very nice, relaxing, and you have to use your mind to understand how to get help from the others animals around, the design of the environment and the animals it's pleasant and you will not be bored by the sounds, it's a very gracefull game to play at that will make you smile			",569,301,21,95,44,2,70

												This game surprised me.  I basically bought it because it looked cute, and cute games don't terrify me, but it's all a lie.  This is a game where you are forced to make characters eat each other in order to accomplish your goals, so it's not as cute as it looks.  Anyway, I really enjoy it.  It's very freeform, and it's fun to have to figure out what to do next instead of having a clearly defined mission.  It's like life.  This game has kept me entertained for a VERY long time, and it truly is addicting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Toki Toki 1 and thought it was ok for a cheepy Android puzzle game. I didn't even think of buying Toki Tori 2 based off of 1, as I assumed it was ""more of the same"", and I'd had enough. But then I saw this video and was completely convinced to buy TT2:

			PC and Wii U puzzler Toki Tori 2 has gone under the radar, but it's a bold piece of game design - a Metroidvania where you aren't locked off by abilities or weapons, but just knowledge of how the...		

I think Toki Tori 2 is a completely charming game and later on the puzzles are genuinely difficult to figure out, especially if you're 100%ing it. Even though it has a cute exterior, it's really not a children's game. (Though children can obviously play it).re: Steam playtime. I've almost 100%'d it on the Wii U and only bought TT2 on steam as it was on sale for £1 and I wanted to post a positive review. You can read other reviews or watch that linked video for a description of how the game works and plays, right now I'm simply paying £1 to add enthusiasm to the game and hopefully add to the peer pressure that gets you to buy it.
