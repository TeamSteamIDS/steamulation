												This is hands down, bar-none the absolute best hack n slash game ever made. Its only singular problem is the fact that half the game you change characters (which is not bad) and you backtrack the entire game (which is bad) with very little change in level layout. But thats it. Nothing else is wrong with this game.Everything from the sound to the animations to the cutscenes to the voice acting is perfect for this FUN and beautifull action game. It can be picked up by inexperienced players easily (thanks to the automatic) but has incredible depth to its combat thanks to everything being based around timing and when you pull something off its extremely satisfying. Everything just feels....spot on. Its only flaw, the backtracking, is not that bad and i can excuse it because for a game where everything is so spot on and beautifull i truly dont think the creators wanted to make second half of the game this way.

												This game ♥♥♥♥ing rules. The boss fights rock. The combat rocks. The music came and so did I. I'll admit it took quite a few hours (a large distance into the game) before I felt comfortable with how the game played and became competent in combat. It is my first real DMC game. Enemies feel a little damage spongey and there's no shortage of them to annoy you and slow your progress. The sensation of being lost is very brief, Level design and progress is between the perfect threshold. I'll feel a bit lost but only briefly before the destination opens up naturally. But those bosses and stronger enemies man. Phew. I just gave someone Zangeif's Ultimate Atomic Buster and had to post about how satisfying that felt. To the idiots who think bosses have no place in games--please play this game or leave my hobby.			",357,69,3,28,16,2,26

												The best Devil May Cry game available for PC, partly due to the fact that DMC 3 is a terrible port and the PC version of DMC 4 runs great and has some extra♥♥♥♥♥♥ though the game really should be played with a gamepad.The core combat is probably the best of all the DMCs, essentially being DMC 3's combat but with a few additions, the biggest easily being on the fly style switching for Dante, allowing you to switch between the different movesets with the D-pad. However the gameplay is hampered by numerous things. The first being that for just over half the game you play as the new protaganist Nero who is incredibly watered down in comparison to Dante, having only a single sword and gun, no styles and being easier to perform certain actions. Something unique to Nero is his demon hand, the Devil Buster, which allows him to grab enemies towards him or grab himself towards them, as well as a few special moves. Overall while not terrible he's a lot less fun to play as than Dante.Dante suffers from playing second fiddle to Nero over all, when you do get to play him you are just cutting your way back through the levels you went through as Nero and fighting the same bosses, only backwards. Including the default weapons, Dante also only has access to three Devil Arms and Guns each, about half of the previous game's weapon selection.The story is meh. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Doesn't ruin the game and I think if you're playing a DMC game for Shakespear you're playing it for the wrong reasons. I don't really have much more to say on that.Probably missed out on some things, migh edit this later. Overall good, and as I said   in the opening it's the best DMC game available for PC, it just has some rather large pitfalls that stop it from being the best DMC full stop.			",481,131,7,70,48,6,79

												Devil May Cry 4 is a massive showcase of what we could have if we were a better industry.The combat system is deep, complex, and is freeform enough at the same time to have the possibility for tournaments. Everything your character can do can link to 90% of everything else he can do. High difficutly abounds as both you and the enemy are empowered to ludicrous extents as you improve your moveset in turn with the difficulty. The only realy downfall I can say is that it nearly requires you to have a gamepad.The engine itself is so well optimized it borders on black magic. Seriously. This game has run on Windows XP computers that came out before the 360.The story is nothing to truly write home about, but it has a hell of a lot more tact than ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" and ""I'm your prom date you ugly sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥""At the end of the day, if you have to buy any one brawler or character action game on Steam, I highly, highly recommend it be this one. It has an exclusive difficulty mode for the PC since no other system could HANDLE it.The only issues you might have with the game are the lack of quick time events (♥♥♥♥ you if so, the game requires skills that aren't simon says related), the fact that the game demands very, very real skill from beginning to end, especially if you want the best rank for each mission, and finally, the fact that the second half of the story is playing through the same levels against the same bosses as a different character with an entirely different sense of playstyle. If that isn't your thing (different characters halfway through), you probably shouldn't be in this genre to begin with, but there you go.This game is more or less the Redline of brawlers. It burns you out on quality so hard going to anything else just feels WRONG.			",379,32,7,19,21,3,36

												Devil May Cry 4 is an amazing hack-and-slash game that is easy to learn and hard to master. The combat system is very in depth and there is always more room for improvement, even for the greatest masters of the game. It also has many different difficulty levels that will keep you busy for HOURS. You get to play as either Nero, who has a very interesting combat system because of his grab ability, and Dante, who has a variety of weapons and fighting styles to choose from while in game, giving an indefinite number of possibilities for combos. Plus, the game is very pretty, even on the lowest graphics settings, and for a PC port, it is not that bad.Now here's the part where you yell at me for stating my opinion. My main criticisms of the game lie heavily in the story, which I honestly believe was bland and tasteless. Dante isn't the main character, but instead, it's Nero, who in my opinion, acted too much like a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (though his combat is very unique). A majority of the characters are completely one-dimensional and don't really serve any purpose other than being the damsel in distress or the power-hungry bad guy or the envious rival . I pretty much only enjoyed the parts of the story where Dante was included because at least he was cheeky in an enjoyable way. Although I liked Nero's combat style, it got old for me pretty quick. Other downsides include the camera problems (which I am pretty sure is typical for a Devil May Cry game), a lack of costumes, the hideous amount of backtracking which puts Dante's role in the game to shame (I am talking you're backtracking for almost HALF THE GAME), and the lame final boss whose attack patterns are very predictable. Plus there's not much innovation put into the level design, which brings me back to the backtracking issue. I honestly felt like I was playing a somewhat incomplete story.Overall DMC4 was a mostly fun ride from start to end. It does bring back Bloody Palace as well as has a couple fun bosses. What it fails at in areas such as level design and completeness, the game makes up for it with an awesome combat system, beautiful visuals, and long playability.Overall I give Dante May Backtrack 4 a 7/10TL;DR It's fun to play but it's half of a good game.

The Special Edition (re-release/standalone expansion) is coming out on June 24th as a separate product. If you were considering this, I suggest you wait a few months.Devil May Cry 4 is intended for a controller, playable with a keyboard (on the highest difficulties and for doing advanced combos)- but bizarre as the mouse is only for menus. In a lot of cases the game will require the player to press 3+ keys at the same time without ghosting (common in cheap keyboards made only for typing).The game still refers to a left analog stick when listing the inputs for a command, which corresponds to some action with WASD- there is no walk modifier key, and the interact [contextual] button will remain even when the command it's tied to has been rebound.The game also forces the player to play as specific characters for certain missions, while leaving some boss fights unavailable (i.e Sanctus vs Dante; The Savior vs Nero) or far less accessible (i.e Credo vs Dante after 79 waves in Bloody Palace compared to Nero who only needs to reach the end of a mission). This could also affect the general learning curve and game progression (e.g unlocks, next difficulty) if the characters are played for imbalanced amounts of time and/or the player finds a preference of which character to play.In content, it's typical for a Devil May Cry game to have some backtracking or content recycling; in this iteration, it's done quite unimaginatively in having the backtracking mission's traversal mostly be the backwards of the initial path. Another is using the same generic battle theme per character for the non-boss encounters (few exceptions).The game excels in combat and the nuances & quirks in building combos- e.g Jump Canceling, Guard Flying, Guard Cancel, Invulnerable Frames on certain actions; though at points there'll be a disconnection between what the game considers 'stylish' and what is actually technically impressive ('stylish' to other people).If you find yourself having little intention to replay or practice playing the game long enough to accomplish the more technical feats, this game, like most, may not be as satisfying as doing so.

												Devil May Cry 4 is a game with a fantastic, deep combat system that is unfortunately brought down by a lackluster campaign. If you can get around the fact that the levels themselves aren't particularly interesting and that the second half of the campaign is just going through those same levels but backwards, you'll find a game with pretty satisfying combat and a couple of good bosses. This game is also really well optimized and will most likely run like a dream on your computer even if it's several years old.			",248,68,4,15,14,0,12

												To note, a gamepad is virtually a necessity for games of this nature.If you've not played DMC1 or DMC3 I recommend playing those. Get the HD Collection for your console, DMC3 on Steam is not a good port.This game is much like its predecessors, non-stop cuhrayzee action with swords, guns and badass-looking combos.You start off the game as Nero, a novice in the demon hunting arts compared to Dante, so you can get comfortable with some more basic stuff. Halfway through the game though you switch to Dante, and as opposed to DMC3 you can now switch between all of his styles AT WILL, ON THE FLY. It really shows the difference between a novice and a professional, and I think Dante is my favorite character because of the fact that you can do so much♥♥♥♥♥♥with him.Even if you complete the game once, the fun doesn't stop there, as Bloody Palace returns, but one caveat for me is the fact that it's on a timer, whereas the DMC3 one wasn't. Even if you don't dig Bloody Palace, you can still replay the game on Dante Must Die, Heaven or Hell and Dark Knight Mode, which I wholeheartedly recommend.Really, if you just like chaining together huge combos, taunting your enemies and looking like a badass while doing it, definitely consider purchasing this game.

												For the love of everything that is CUHRAYZEE and SACRED, get this game.  This game was built using Capcom's in-house MT Framework and was built on PC FIRST.  It's an excellent PC version - you would be very unwise not to get it.  If you're a single playthrough sort of person you may find the game lacking, but if you enjoyed the frantic fast paced and high level combat of Devil May Cry 3, this game pretty much is a highly refined version of that.  Google around for ""Debug Mode"" for this game, which will allow you to do all sorts of fun things and help you practice getting better at being CUHRAYZEE.This game runs on a toaster and still looks polished and beautiful today, almost half a decade after its release.  Show Capcom we want the Devil May Cry of old back by supporting this game!			",750,185,17,97,70,3,103

												So i've played this game for about 40 hours or so and I think it's time to tell you guys my opinion of the game so far. I'll probably be updating this review the more i play this game, but this is my opinion so far.This game donesn't have the awesome atmosphere, enviroments and music that DMC3 had, but it's still and awesome game. The graphics are great! They still hold up 6 years after its release. The voice acting is also pretty good and the story is okay. But you don't play a DMC game for that story♥♥♥♥♥♥ You play it for the combat! The fighting mechanics have been revamped since DMC3. Now Dante can switch fighting styles on the go and can hold 3 guns, and melee weapons at the same time which makes for much more possibilities. They've also added a new character named Nero who is actually the main character of the game. Even though he's not as complex as Dante, he's still got a far bit of depth to his combos and relies more on timing with his EX gauge. Nero is also more accesable to new players of the series. His combos are more simple in comparison to Dante, but he still plays great. There were also some new features added to the PC version of this game, the best of these being the new difficulty, Legendary Dark Knight mode. Legendary Dark Knight mode is a great addition to the game and it's pretty addictive as well. This game will also run on a low end PC just fine , there is also alot of replay value here and if you love the DMC series, you'll find yourself sinking plenty of hours into this game. Now here comes the bad. My problems with the game would be that it doesn't feel as finished or polished as DMC3, and that's because it's not. The enviroments are kind of copy and paste (Except for the Jungle) and the music is mediocre at best. It is also alot more repetative than the previous games (I don't know about 2 because i've never played it). You fight the 4 same bosses at least 3 times in 1 playthrough and the chess sections are just so dumb. But that doesn't mean the game is bad. Overall it has great graphics, cool cutscenes and the best combat system in any game i've played. If you can get over it's minor flaws, you will have a blast experimenting with new and different combos and enjoying yourself in one of the best action games of all time.			",186,15,2,24,13,1,12

												Lazy, spontaneous review incoming: DMC4 is a mixed bag for both longtime fans and newcommers alike, and for legit reasons. DMC4 has multiple flaws ranging from unfair enemy AI to backtracking, but at the same time offers what I think is the most complex and rewarding gameplay in the genre. Here are a few major pros and cons many have with this title:Pros-Amazing Gameplay. It doesn't take long for one to be a decent DMC4 player as its much more lenient than its prodecessors. However the meta of this game has been developing for more almost 7 years, with no sign of stopping, and if you intend to keep up with it, you'll end up crying and wishing you'd play DmC:DmC:DE instead. Combo videos and tournaments show how far the gameplay has evolved.-Cheesy DialogueThis game has cheesy one liners and story, some of it is unintentionally bad, but most of it is intentional, mostly when it comes to Dante.-Efficient Port. Seriously, this game can run on a toaster powered by Homer Simpson's brain. I ran this on an i5 with integrated graphics (HD4000) and it ran anywhere between 50-90fps at medium settings at 720p. With my new laptop, I can run it at 120fps (the game is capped at that framerate) at 1080p with everything maxed out. However, recording gameplay is strangely demanding/inconsistent. I recommend you use something like Bandicam (with Motion JPEG or another, more efficient codec) or Dxtory to record, though I assume most of you have PCs powerful enough to not notice a thing.-GraphicsSure, compared to games of today, the graphics are below average, but for its age it holds up well. Especially if you consider it ran at an average of 60fps on consoles, and should be better looking when DMC4SE comes out. A minor point as this game's strengh comes in gameplay, but still worth pointing out.Cons-BacktrackingIts horrible, about half of the game consists of backtracking. Granted, some areas have been changed significantly, and virtually all enemy waves are altered, but the same levels appear multiple times. -Nero as a Main CharacterA lot of the backlash of this game was the replacement of the series' main protagonist, Dante, with a younger character called Nero. He takes more than half of the game for himself, so might even argue most of the game since Dante backtracks Nero's missions. This is more of a con to longtime fans of the series. He's an amature and cries a lot for my liking. His gameplay is also more shallow in comparison to Dante's, but to Nero's credit, still has enough for veterans to experiment with (seriously, I play Dante much more than Nero, but I can still appreciate the skill and creativity players display with him).-Unfair EnemiesDMC4 has the best gameplay I've ever seen in the genre, but paradoxically lacks good enemies. Dont get me wrong, a good fraction of the depth should be attributed to the enemies and how their physics and AI work. But if there's one thing I hate, its unfair attack cues. Certain enemies have attacks that are downright cheap. The time between the attack animation starts to when the attack hits (the player) can last less than a second, which can be avoidable if you were doing nothing else but standing, but in a game like this, odds are that you were in the middle of an attack, in a room filled with enemies. Certain enemies like Chimeran Assualts and Chimeran Scarecrows attack the player even if they're stunned, with almost random attack patterns with no attack cues. You basically have to play it safe and use quick long ranged attacks that contribute to bordom. Unfortunately, around half of the enemies have at least one cheap attack, which is sad considering there wouldn't be any problem if it wasn't for that 1 or so attack.-StoryThe series never had a strengh in story, gameplay and style always came first. This may or may not be a good thing for you. For me it certainly didn't matter, but there are some newcomers that believe every game should be a hollywood movie. The game is arguably a downgrade in story quality, when compared to DMC3.TL;DR: If you're into stylish gameplay that will keep your attention for years, I highly recommend this game. If you intend to play this game only once, it can be hard for me to recommend you this game. Especially if you're into the CINEMATIK XPERIENZ			",32,2,0,0,6,0,1

												The best DMC game on steam currently since DMC3's port was godawful sadly, This game can probably run on a potato the engine is so lightweight and if you have a system to max it out, it looks glorious and runs at constant 60fps, I would say get a controller though, but you don't NEED one i just prefer it. The combat has a lot of potential mostly with dante and his on the fly style switching, decently challenging including a PC exclusive mode Legendary Dark Knight mode that spawns in hordes of enemies that isn't present on the console version for obvious reasons, overall a good buy.

												Name me one other series of game where fighting is this intense, this varied, this challenging, and this fast.This game is beautiful.The flow of combat is beautiful.The AI is beautiful (fight Dante at the fight before Sanctus on DMD mode. You'll see what I mean.)The graphics are downright stunning, and are optimized enough to run well on a craptop.I'm serious. I haven't seen optimization this good since Half-Life 2.Don't like Nero? Ok. You get Dante in ten missions. He plays even more smoothly than he did in DMC3. His combos, as an effect, are now so varied it's borderline ridiculous, and they don't feel even remotely choppy.Not enough enemies? No problem. Play on Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. You'll have so many enemies that your style meter won't know what to do.Too slow for you? They've also got that covered. Turbo is in the PC version. Play Devil May Cry at 120% the speed it was before. That's damn fast.Don't like the bosses? Who cares? You get Bloody Palace once you beat the game (on not Easy). You don't even have to play as Nero in it. You can start as Dante and show off your combo-crazy prowess on wave after wave of unfortunate foes.Don't like Dante? Go see a doctor.9.3/10The only thing wrong with this game is the repitition of bosses (even moreso than the first DMC) and the terrible way the dice game was implemented on Dante Must Die difficulty.But to be honest, I've had more fun with the bosses here than I had with every other DMC.

												I paid $5 for Devil May Cry 4 and it took around 13 hours to finish on Devil Hunter mode.  I used an Xbox 360 controller the entire time.  I wouldn't say I did great, but I still got to the end with some frustration.  I'd say I highly recommend this one.  I've never played a DMC game before.  The closest I got was X-Blades and that...wasn't really a good representative of the spectacle fighter genre or whatever it's called.  This review is probably better aimed at people new to the series like I was.  The game is a third-person action title.  Apart from solving some simple puzzles, DMC4 largely revolves around fighting groups of mooks and large bosses, often in a “room locks, kill everything to proceed” format.  Nero's gameplay involves using a mix of his gun and sword for regular combat, but he has a unique feature in his Devil Bringer arm for heavy but slow attacks or for bringing an enemy/yourself closer or to evade some attacks.  Dante's gameplay involves on-the-fly swapping between his four stances along with changing his ranged and melee weapons.  Nero's playstyle felt easy to use for a newcomer like me, and Dante felt pretty advanced though I still did fine without really using his full potential.  DMC4 is the kind of game that rewards you for learning its systems and playing well.  You're graded at the end of each mission on time taken, Style points, the percentage of Red Orbs found, and any modifying bonuses or penalties like using no items or dying and continuing.  Higher ratings give more Proud Souls which are spent to unlock new abilities or weapon combos or the like.  You can also refund spent Proud Souls to tweak or completely remake your build between missions or at the Divinity Statues scattered through the environment.  Time taken is self-explanatory, and Red Orbs are found in the world and are dropped by enemies, and these are spent at Divinity Statues for consumable recovery items or permanent boosts with no refund option.  As for Style points, one of the series' features is its high risk Style system.  By avoiding damage and attacking enemies with strings of combos, your Style meter will raise and increase in rank.  Getting hit will knock you down a couple of ranks, and using your guns to play it safe won't impress anyone.  It's a largely optional feature, but apart from the rewards mentioned above, it does feel awesome to work up to a high rank and keep it going.  There are a total of seven difficulty levels though you start with two.  For what I played being “normal” level, it was still pretty tough, though I imagine it'd be a cakewalk for veterans.  Apart from the unlockable standard hard and very hard, there are a couple of different ones where both you and the enemies die in a single hit, where only you die in a single hit and the enemies don't, or one where enemies spawn in fairly large packs as shown in some of the screenshots on the Steam Store page.  There are other things to unlock on the collectibles side, like the Gallery entries or in-game achievements, and there are Secret Missions hidden away with bonuses for those who can complete them.  Overall, I enjoyed DMC4 despite some annoyances like having to fight the camera a couple of times, or bosses that were a chore to kill.  I probably won't pick it up again anytime soon, but I left the game on a high note at least.  The game ran incredibly well on my rig in DirectX10 mode and I think I only saw less than 60 frames maybe once the entire run.  There's a lot of replay value if you like the idea of harder challenges or just want to get a better score.  This version of the game tends to be cheaper than the Special Edition, though that obviously has more content and features in its favor.   ",519,139,12,130,27,8,81

You begin with a tutorial in game and then after you complete it, you have to go on different missions. There are lots of objectives and replaybility of the scenes in the game. Just make sure you have a decent video card otherwise you will get serious lag. Thankfully there are lots of options to adjust to in the menu so you can play according to your machine.

												- Analysis done in 2015- In spite of being a game released on 2008 its graphics are really good.DMC saga lovers ofc should play this title, storytelling is quite good, the classic Hack and Slash in the saga is alive in this game and I would reccommend it to anyone who likes HnS games.It definitely worths a buy in the steam sales, the game enviorment is amazing for me and i completed the main story in 7:10:35 (Not rushed).Sometimes could get a bit repetitive and some areas are quite rough, you may get lost a bit at some point if you are not used to play games like this one. At the end, bought reccommended.7.5/10 ---> Should buy while reduced price.			",600,208,31,63,46,6,74

Devil May Cry 4 is an action hack and slash fantasy game. It is renowned as quite challenging (with solid AI and bunch of difficulties), therefore, a simple button mashing won't be beneficial. In addition to fighting, there are also some puzzles to solve and a good plot to enjoy:Story itself is a sequel to Devil May Cry 3 but fully understandable even if you didn't play previous games. Summary of the story in one sentence: Nero goes out on a hunt to kill Dante, a half demon who's presumably a murderer, just to find out who's the real threat to mankind. It has a little bit of everything: action, drama and comedy, thus, making it a really enjoyable ride.During the playthrough you get to play as both Dante (easygoing, sarcastic and calm guy) and Nero (impetuous and naive kid). They have a decent weapon arsenal and skill diversity but plays similarly. The character swap happens as you progress halfway through the story but the main issue here is that as soon as you get to play as Dante you must complete the same path that Nero did. Only backwards with few additions here and there. This turns into a bigger problem when you have to kill the same boss for the third time throughout the game. It shows laziness and lack of creativity from developers. Another thing that I really loved is that demons (especially bosses) have a very unique design and differ in their abilities. Accordingly, you're bound to adapt and learn how to deal with them.The biggest disappointments for me were controls, the menu and the most of all, absurd camera angles. These problems greatly reduced my enjoyment while playing but nevertheless the positive aspects strongly outweigh the negatives and I'd recommend this game to everyone.7/10 ",203,42,10,15,12,1,17

												DMC4 is a perfect example of a rushed game. The fact that it's a great game shows that we could have so much more if more time was given. The combat is wonderful, fluid, exciting and it's accessible for newbies but still complex enough for experts.There are two playable characters: - Nero that is perfect for new players but doesn't have nearly as much weapons as Dante.- Dante that is suited to more experienced players and when used right, can do anything.The visuals are beautiful and colorful while running at 60 FPS even on consoles.The soundtrack is great. Its got handful of heavy-metal tunes that will pump you while playing.And i didn't even mention how PC port good is! PC players can experience turbo mode which speeds the game up 20% and the Legendary Dark Knight mode which is riddled with enemies.The biggest problem with the game is ..... that it isn't finished.Seriously. The second half of the game is backtracking through the ALL Nero levels with some twists then and now.But still, DMC4 is an wonderful, wonderful action game that keeps you pumped on while slashing through enemies with complex, deep combat system and beautiful visuals while keeping stable 60 FPS which puts to shame other games from the seventh generation.There's not really much reason to buy this version of the game because DMC4 Special Edition was released in 2015 for only 5 dollars  more.9/10 a must have for every action games fan !

												One of the best genres of games I've ever played. It's completely compatible as a pc version too (unlike the previous DmC 3). The game is challenging, but fun enough that dying isn't a huge issue on some of the higher difficulties. It's quite stereotypical where the guy has to save the girl, but it definitely has a unique aspect to it. Some of the girls also wear quite revealing outfits in this game and they have tried very hard with boob physics on them. That's a warning. Or a selling point.			",217,50,6,29,13,3,10

												I recommend this game solely based on the good Gameplay.The story and the main Character you are forced to play for a good part of the game are just ridiculous and boring. Dante is the boss and cool dude. That rebel emo brat, I just can't take it. Also typical Capecom rip-off where they make you re-play the same levels all over again, the same boss... Good challenge (apart from not hating Nero and his girlfriend). Excellent PC version, not a single crash and ran flawlessly on my 4y old PC. I played using a Xbox 360 controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DMC4 is a fun hack-and-slash romp, with two distinct styles of play. As you progress through the various levels and difficulties, you slowly accumulate power, and become something akin to a♥♥♥♥♥♥talking, pizza-eating badass. And by akin to, I mean that's exactly what you become. There are two characters in DMC4, each with their own style of play- you play as Nero for the first half of the game, and the overall series protagonist, Dante when he is incapcitated. Nero uses his demonically-enhanced arm, the Devil Bringer to pull off most of his special moves, which mean most of them are grappling moves. These range from just slamming a common foe to the ground to tossing and flinging a boss through the air. In addition, he wields his sword- the  Red Queen - and his revolver- the  Blue Rose. Each can be charged for more powerful attacks.Dante is a more versatile character from the time you get him, wielding three weapons at the beginning and gaining four (well, five) as you progress. Each weapon has it's disadvantages and advantages (Gilgamesh is slow, but strong i.e)  and can further diversify it's moveset with the use of Styles- which allow you to further customize how Dante plays.If I have any complaint, it's that some of the button prompts have been unchanged from their original console release.

												I played this on console when it came out, had a few hundred hours on it.I strongly recommend this game, it's an incredible action adventure from start to finish, with a combat system second to none. It does have a downside, it has a very tedious story mode over the other DMC games, and involves way too much backtracking, covering the same ground, reusage of assests, etc....Still great regardless of this.

												Let me begin by asking a question to those of you who have not played Devil may cry 4 or just devil may cry in general...WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?!? SCREW YOUR DAMN GOAT SIMULATORS AND GET THIS GAME! IT'S LIKE 20 BUCKS OR WHATEVER! So as you may of guessed I'm a pretty big fan of the series with Dmc4 being my favorite of the series and 1 of my favorite games of all time.To boil it down this game is a action hack and slash game. In my opinion this game has the best hack and slash mechanics of the DMC series and any hack and slash game I've ever seen. At no point in playing this game did I feel like I was pressing one button to win. Reaching SSS mid combo will probably leave you feeling pretty impressed with your self. The cut scenes range from cheesy to holy crap that was awesome.The story is about Nero a new character of the series who works for ""The order of the sword"" A hot head swordsman who just so happens to be voiced by the same voice actor who voices  Ichigo from Bleach (Keep that in my mind as you rip demons in two). Kyrie is also new character of and is also voiced by a bleach voice actor(Orihime) Even her dress is a referrence to certain ark in Bleach. Utimately though she's a walking plot device. Although if there ever is a DMC5 I would love to see this character again maybe trained by Trish and Lady.As for Dante if you liked him before you're gonna love him in this game. He's funny and fun to play as and fun to fight against. Not only is his character wonderfully developed but he also referrences (Story wise and gameplay wise) past dmc games in not only a awesome way, but in a way were nothing is spolied for new comers or redundant to veterans. Not only that but he also does all this without using flashbacks (Take notes 90% of animes).One last thing to mention. The part where you back track half the game as Dante. This really isn't as bad or lazy as you think it is... Hear me out before you down vote. Back tracking has always been this lurking element of DMC but it's definitely more noticeable in this. Especially Dmc3 were you just play through the whole game as Vergil. Having Dante finishing what Nero started and giving back tracking a story purpose rather than just doing it for the sake of back tracking was kind of a nice touch. This was probably Capcoms way of killing 2 birds with one stone(aka Story and two playable characters) Don't get me wrong Dante could of just went to new ares with new Hell gates to fight the demons that survived Nero, but I'd like to give Capcom some credit on putting some thought into this. They could of easily just rinse and repeat dmc3.A quick note before I forget. If you were wondering about rebuying this game for pc and was worried it would be a bad port. Let me assure you this is a wonderful port, it feels just as natural as the console versions and looks godly on highest settings.In the end I give this game a 9 out of 10. In the words of Egoraptor ""YOU SEE THIS?!? THIS IS A SEQUEL, THIS IS A ♥♥♥♥ING SEQUEL!!!""			",61,0,1,2,1,1,1

												Personally, I enjoyed the game a lot, the combat does feel a tad stiff, but it tends to keep you on your toes. The game is a bit easy, but there are ways to make it harder. The added difficulty is somewhat artificial though, as it adds more enemies and makes you take more damage. They constantly reuse the same enemies, bosses, music, and even areas. If you fall into a habit of reusing the same combos, it will definitely start to feel stale. All in all, it's a good game, but does suffer from laziness, as I expected more assets and variety.

												First don't be fooled by the play time, I played this game a lot before I got it on steam borrowed DMC4 on ps3 or w/e and I did beat it more than once back then. Also this is a must have game!Pros:    -Great Epic story LOVED IT    -Epic new char Nero enjoyed playing as him    -Great combos with both Nero and Dante    -The difficulty, not 2 hard but hard enough to give everyone a challenge on their first playthrough no matter how good of a DMC player they are    -Soundtrack is amazing    -Graphics are godlike (this game came out in 2008 or so and for that time its unreal)    -Cinematics are soooo epic words can't describe it    -The story again :DCons:    -Nero could have used a weapon more or even 2 you know like Dante always gets em and stuff    -Would be epic if this game had achievements but I won't make it affect the love I have for this game    -Erm the story is toooo good? xD I guess the only con is that Nero doesn't get a new weapons like Dante does but the arm makes up for it in this game(Still hoping that one day we will get a Devil May Cry 5)Conclusion:    -Loved the game if you love any other DMC games or any other hack 'n slash game you have to play thisRating: SSS/10			",141,20,1,8,6,1,6

												Having played a lot of it as of recently, i felt that it's necessary for me to write a bit of a review and what I think of the game.I'll admit that this game is somewhat outdated especially with PlatinumGames releasing Metal Gear Rising on Steam (and is also working on Activision's Legend or Korra game, which is also confirmed for a PC release.) However, i will admit that Devil May Cry for the most part has enjoyable combat, and the boss fights are pretty damn satisfying.A few things that might put some people off would be the pacing in the second half of the story, though I imagine that this is done to let the player spend a good amount of time playing as Dante, which i will admit is satisfying in its own wayTo those who didn't get a chance to get it on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3, I would strongly reccomend this game provided that you own an Xbox 360 controller. Even if you do own it on either platform, I still feel that you should get it during a sale to enjoy the Legendary Dark Knight difficulty which has so far given me a really good first impression.

												4 letters to describe this game ""EPIC"". This game is literally amongst the best games I have ever played I personally found it more enjoyable over Bioshock 2 which says a lot. May not beat MGS but this is definitely a must have for anyone who wants an original and fun experience that actually offers a lot of extra content without DLC and a challenge. Anyone who liked the original game for PS3 and the games before that for PS2  since it's a PSN exclusive so to speak must have this game. Personally I loved everything about it. THe camera can be a bit annoying but it's pretty damn good. The graphics are demanding but you can lower the settings significantly to make it playable on a laptop with a celeron card. Visusals are excellent and this carries  the fame the series had brought to make it so iconic and it carries a whole new storyline that could have been expanded still could be but who knows since the reboot.......won't leave much of a cliffhanger but does imply that this story isn't over. As for the mechanics yes it is hack and slash typical much like dark souls but in my opinion much faster paced and a true masterpiece while Dark Souls has a medieval tone and an actual intelligent lore/plot that doesn't make this a runner up definitely on par with Dark Souls 1 and 2. THis game offers a lot for 20 bucks high replay value much like the ones before this and a great cast of characters. IF you like Bleach anime well good news Johnny Yong Bosch the voice actor for Ichigo Kurosaki is Dante and Nero the main characters of the game. Each I think is unique and awesome in their own way but as a die hard fan since the first came out I would Dante is the best LOL. This game is not for children as well and the comical moments in such intense parts make the story all the more enjoyable for anyone. The game character you unlock are balanced and each one is completely unique in their style of fighting and such and the game like before and the reboot from 2012-13 still contains the epic and amazing stylized action that is like the matrix but a bit more badass in some moments. You're practically neo in this game as Dante or Nero. Great game 10/10. Recommend to anyone specifically Dark Souls fans etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Remarkably awesome spectacle fighter that ends up not taking itself too seriously with it's great sense of humor, in contrast to how it starts out. Admittedly, it starts out kinda weak, but about a quarter of the way through it begins to get real good, then at around the middle point, when you take control of Dante(whom you kick insurmountable amount of♥♥♥♥♥with in true DMC fashion) is when you realize how awesome this game is. Its by no means flawless(what game is?), the Gyroblades and the dice ""puzzles"" were just annoying and in poor taste IMO, but too few and far between all the ridiculous♥♥♥♥♥kicking and platforming to come even close to ruining the whole experience.  It goes without saying that theres a lot of depth in the combat and the cutscenes are simply spectacular, but the cherry on top is the fact that DMC4 is just an exceptional PC port, probably the best port of all time because it rarely dips below 120fps while looking absolutely stunning, the only times it does drop is sometimes at the start of cutscenes(probably due loading) and also if you have vsync enabled it bugs out occasionally and drops to 60fps in some parts, but I tested it and with in-game vsync disabled its a constant 120fps otherwise. You'll probably wanna force vsync from your driver because it tears pretty bad. A minor issue which never happens during combat, but worth a mention I suppose. Worth multiple playthroughs /10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With it's fluid combat mechanics, astounding character models, and level and enemy variety, it's hard to see why Devil May Cry 4 has been overlooked and underrated. The game allows you to take on the role of Nero, and later Dante, the latter being the main protagonist of the series, having more weapons, however in DMC4, you are playing the role of Nero instead, who has comparitevly less weapons and movesets. The story of DMC4 unfortunately is not there. Although lengthy at around 12 hours, you will find yourself stuck in a cliche of Nero's love interest being snatched away, and he must rescue her (Mario I'm looking at you). You'll hack, slash, and shoot your way through hordes of varied enemies, across semi - linear levels. The latter part of the campaign however, is where you might see it getting repetitive, with you playing the story essentially in reverse order, but this time as Dante. Aside from the story, something that DMC4 does do right (and in my opinion, makes it worth getting), is the combat system. As mentioned before, fighting in DMC4 is like no other, and is smooth as butter. Both Nero and Dante are equipped with 2 categories of weapons: ranged and Melee. Nero having a double barreled revolver named Blue Rose, and a motorcycle engine sword, Red Queen. While this may seem little, each weapons has its own unique moves, and can be executed using combos on the keyboard. These moves can be linked with a little practice (I recommend learning how to Jump Cancel first), and can make for a very fun time. If that's not enough, Nero also has a special melee/pseudo ranged weapon named the Devil Bringer, allowing you to smash enemies into the ground WWE style, drag enemies closer to you, and pull off various high damaging finisher moves. On the other end of the spectrum, Dante is the one with the absurd amount of weapons, ranging from his signature pistols Ebony and Ivory, to a transformable suitcase called Pandora. What's more is that Dante has various styles to choose from, ranging from Gunslinger, to Sword Master, Royal Guard, and Trickster. Each has its own unique abilities to manipulate certain weapons. Gunslinger allows free play of Dante's ranged weapons, such as and aerial spinning top move with his pistols, rapid firing his shotgun Coyote-S, or adding new forms to Pandora. Sword Master allows Dante to perform special moves regarding his sword, Rebellion, his rocket-fist Giglamesh, and the explosive spear dealer, Lucifer. Royal Guard allows Dante to heavily mitigate damage from enemies, building up his rage bar, and eventually allowing him to release devastating counter attacks, and even transform into an invicible armor. Finally, Trickster allows Dante to move faster, short range teleport, and perform other stylish moves to better evade, and gain a position on enemies. All of these styles can be switched on the fly with no delay (unless you're standing still), and can be employed very effectively. All of this combat is rated by an in game on the fly letter grade system, ranging from a D-SSS. Overall, get DMC4 if you enjoy hack n' slash games with fluid combat, but prepare to be dissapointed should you buy it for the story. P.S.: For those who are wondering, there is indeed a ""endless combat"" mode, deemed Bloody Palace. While not exactly endless, its 101 floors will provide plenty of challenge and replayability.

												After my ps3 broke down, I was sad that I wasn't able to play Devil May Cry 4 anymore, which I ""borrowed"" from a friend. I waited for the whole summer sale to see if the price can drop lower than $5. It didn't, however a friend of mine was kind enough to gift it to me. The graphics looks superb on the pc, and plays really well. The load time is non-existant compared to the ps3 version, however this may be the fault of the ps3. I am playing on the xbox gamepad, which the target button is RB in default controls. I thought it would be a good idea to change it to RT. However, once I get to Dante's part of the game, the control gets weird because I need the right side to be easily accessible for the weapon switch and target at all times!!!!! HELP!!Aside from that, the boss battles are enjoyable. Like previous dmc games, they have patterns in their attacks. Your best interest would be to know when exactly they do their attacks so you can dodge and execute an attack. Another reason why boss battles are so enjoyable is the awesome soundtrack that plays in the background. You have the Techno Frog and Sworn Through Swords. However, there is only one track that plays for each character. (The time has come and so have I!)			",213,29,1,10,5,2,15

Two warnings, it is short, and half of the game is back tracking. It makes up for the backtracking with the fact that*spoiler*you play as Dante through it*spoiler end*, and the big difference in the combat on the way back makes up for it. So, get it and have a blast slicing and dicing up some fresh monsters for your tasty pie.			",94,2,0,12,4,0,3

												Awesome game. People say it's a bad PC port, but honestly I played with keyboard and controller each with one run through. It's doable on easier modes to play with keyboard, so if you're just looking to play the game and get the DMC experience out of one or two run throughs, it's totally worth it. I picked it up for 5 buckeroos on sale, and I'm not disappointed at all. This was my first entry into the series, and while you shouldn't expect too much plot wise, or even character wise, (coming in with no initial impressions of the DMC world whatsoever), you can expect a LOT combat wise. The game allows you to switch between Nero and Dante depending on the chapter in the game you are on, and the variances in fighting style mix up the game in an other-wise boring re-run through of all the levels (yes, the second half of the game plows you right in the opposite direction of the first- you go through all of the levels again pretty much.) The PC edition even adds a new difficulty- legendary dark knight mode, which I ran through the first 3 levels with a keyboard (so, it is doable), and have gotten to level 7 with a controller. It's pretty freakin' fantastic to fight 30+ enemies on hardmode, and makes you feel all around like a b055.  All in all, I've become very attached to all the characters, (except maybe Kyrie, but no hate) and would totally reccommend this game to anyone lookin' for a good ole' hack n slash. Personally, I'm an RPG fan all around, but this game has enough RPG elements to keep me in tune. I'll be picking up the HD Collection this winter.			",62,4,0,9,2,0,3

												Beautiful graphics despite it being almost 5 years old. The storyplot is above decent, but what I love the most about this game is the gameplay...and Dante's awesomesauce. You need a controller for this game (preferably an Xbox 360 controller). The game will take you about 10 - 15 hours to beat depending on how serious you are about the game or how quickly you want to get it over with.I highly recommend it.HOWEVERI will warn against you to buy the bundle as DMC3 is a horribly done port. Just buy DMC4 on its own, it is the only playable DMC game on Steam other than the Ninja Theory reboot.			",36,5,0,2,0,0,2

												This game is good but I expected it to be better. I thought it'd be like DMC 3 but with updated graphics and properly ported to the PC. Granted it looks great and actually works but there were no moments that made me grin with delight like in DMC 3. Most of the game you are playing as Not-Dante. I don't know why they made the new character and then made him just a supermarket own brand rip off of the character you actually want to be playing as. The level design is disappointing, you go through one way as Not-Dante and then back again as Dante. There are some really cool weapons but you have no choice with Not-Dante and you don't get much chance to use Dante's weapons before switching back to Not-Dante. One bit particularly annoyed me where (unless I was doing something wrong) you could not get past a hall of lasers if you had not bought the correct upgrades. Overall however I would recommend this over DMC 3 because it is fun and it actually works on the PC.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												This was a fun game though shorter and easier then dmc 3. The good news is it works much better with game pad and so much easier combo wise thanks to automatic. The only pitfall is that it shares the same problem as dmc 3 in that it still can't use the mouse which sucks alot. If you can't cope with that, then don't play it. Still an amazing game though a tad on the short side. The story is very well done with incredable cutscenes. I just wish it was a bit more challanging and much bigger. DMC 3 had such a bigger world though not many enemies. Regardless, it's still better then dmc 3 simply for the easier combat system and multiple characters. Def a good play but still better to be played on console rather then PC due to the controller being better and the lack of the mouse.			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

Overall i would rate this game 4.5/5, my reason being i would have prefered the lateist one to come out before this one since it explains a lot about DMC3.			",152,6,8,23,13,0,22

												Is this a brilliant and intelligent game? No, not really. Is it hard and fun? Indeed it is! Considering it's age the graphics are good, it's fast paced and challenging. Depending on what type of gamer you are the game will last a long time. I myself have played for almost 30 hrs and I know I am not done yet, because I know I can get better and beat the game on a higher difficulty.The graphics have improved from the third game and the enemies are a lot more interesting in this game than in DMC3. Although the number of bosses has fallen greatly, they are of higher quality. And although you have to fight them all twice, you get to do it with two very different characters allowing you to test yourself against yourself. Some people dislike Nero as a character. I sure don't. But even if I did I have to note the versatile playing styles presented. When you play as Nero the devilbringer is essential, but suddenly you switch to Dante, who has no such thing. The two playing styles are fun to master since this brings a revitalising element to the game.Although the story is kinda weak(even weaker than the story in DMC3), the game makes up for it by having a solid fighting mechanic taken from DMC3 and improved. As mentioned the devilbringer is really fun to use, and although Dante only uses 3 weapons in this game, he uses all 3 at the same time, meaning you don't have to switch at the shops, and you have a lot more to play with on the battlefield. Furthermore he also has trickster, gunslinger, swordmaster, and royal guard from DMC3 and like with the weapons you can use all on the battlefield.As a bonus he gains Darkslayer later on which functions a lot like Vergil did in the Special edition of DMC3.Is this game better than DMC3? Not really sure. Is it just as fun? I would say so. I highly recommend this game. And if I should give it a score I would say 85/100 - not good enough to rank in the 90's but close to it!

What starts out as the typical storyline for Dante to take over, Nero takes upon that role to perish the hellish creatures arising into the world. This is a great hack/slash game and I would give it to anyone who's got a decent graphics card and processor to handle it.			",69,21,0,15,10,0,3

												Probably the best devil may cry game including DMC. Favorite devil arm and gun combo Gilgamesh and Pandora. The Buster attacks are pretty powerful but could have had more attacks with it. Story is great but I wish I could use Dante more. Sanctus is such a hard boss though you will wish him dead. Secret ending was cool. Bloody palace would have been better if you didn't alaways start over each new try. Lastly I wish there was something to do in after story besides Bloody Palace. Awesome game but could have been better. I rate Devil May Cry 4 a 4.5 out of 5			",30,12,0,7,4,0,0

												One of the best - if not the best - Hack and Slash Action whatever it is called games ever. It has the awesome characterization of Dante that I already came to enjoy in DMC 3 but a combat system that feels way better. DMC 3 had some performance problems like the camera switching the angle without warning, leaving you jumping down from platforms it took you hours to get onto. I love the idea and the implementation of the Devil Bringer Nero has. It can be used in so many ways - to evade, to attack, to defend, to stop enemy attacks etc. combined with useful sword combos (that also have really badass animations) makes the game worth playing for the combat system only. The background story is - if not very original - staged very well and I like all of the characters. The new look of ""Lady"" is a bit weird imo but you hardly see her so that is not a problem at all. I would recommend buying this any day to everyone - 20 € is not that much so even if you don't like it, nothing is lost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played each Devil May Cry's that are out from the first one to the newist one (DMC Devil May Cry). I have so far ejoyed the storys of each one however, with DMC 4 storyline being completely different i think they really couldn't do a insain job on making me want to keep on playing it.The graphics from DMC 3 to this one have changed greatly as well as the new enemys, gameplay i would personaly say is alot harder than usual due to the fact that there are so many different enemys. Overall i would rate this game 4.5/5, my reason being i would have prefered the lateist one to come out before this one since it explains a lot about DMC3.			",152,6,8,23,13,0,22

Although it confuses me as to why Dante isn't the main character of his own game, Nero with his devil arm does not disappoint and is capable of some pretty impressive combos. My only complaint is that this game doesn't seem to have near as high of a replayability value as the other DMC's.			",35,3,0,8,3,0,2

												After my ps3 broke down, I was sad that I wasn't able to play Devil May Cry 4 anymore, which I ""borrowed"" from a friend. I waited for the whole summer sale to see if the price can drop lower than $5. It didn't, however a friend of mine was kind enough to gift it to me. The graphics looks superb on the pc, and plays really well. The load time is non-existant compared to the ps3 version, however this may be the fault of the ps3. I am playing on the xbox gamepad, which the target button is RB in default controls. I thought it would be a good idea to change it to RT. However, once I get to Dante's part of the game, the control gets weird because I need the right side to be easily accessible for the weapon switch and target at all times!!!!! HELP!!Aside from that, the boss battles are enjoyable. Like previous dmc games, they have patterns in their attacks. Your best interest would be to know when exactly they do their attacks so you can dodge and execute an attack. Another reason why boss battles are so enjoyable is the awesome soundtrack that plays in the background. You have the Techno Frog and Sworn Through Swords. However, there is only one track that plays for each character. (The time has come and so have I!)			",213,29,1,10,5,2,15

												I can't recommend this game enough. Between CUHRAYZEE fights, being stylish as ♥♥♥♥, and the badassness of both Dante and Nero, there's absolutely NO reason you shouldn't own this game if you like action. The PC exclusive features are by far the best and biggest improvement over the console port, barring the standard stuff (graphics, framerate stability, any input you want) The Legendary Dark Knight mode fills your screen with so many enemies your head will explode and the game will repeatedly hand your♥♥♥♥♥to you and make you cry, until you get the hang of all the mechanics and intricate nuances with Nero's abilities and attacks, and especially more so for Dante. I highly recommend this game, the best PC port I've ever played, flawless. 10/10 would play any time.			",117,4,1,4,0,0,12

												Gotta, say I'm not a fan of playing as Nero.  Lack of weapons/styles really makes the game feel a little dull.  Granted having Exceed ability from the get go really levels the playing field.  Master that tech and you'll breeze through the game.  And the Devil Bringer can make crowd management a bit easier, but overall the game shines when you're playing as Dante.  Have access to all five styles was something I dreamt about when I played DMC3.  While the story for the games is a take-it-or-leave-it issue for most people, I'm just glad (more like exstatic) that there are no QTEs during the cinemas so I can actually enjoy Dante's cheezy one-liners and soliloquy's about♥♥♥♥♥♥♥metaphors.Also, gotta give a shout-out to Turbo mode.  Definitely makes this version the best of the three.  At least until DMC4:SE hits PS4/X1 (and hopefully Steam).			",105,3,0,12,1,1,3

												Devil May Cry 4 is an ambitious, unfinished sequel that doesn't really have a hope in hell of improving as a whole upon what are considered it's true predecessors. That being said, it's still a decent game, but it just doesn't have the charm, the love of 3 or 1. Dante just feels a little bit emptier than before, and that goes for his dialogue and gameplay as well. Yes, style switching is really really cool! It's super fun, and when you get the hang of it everything just feels like one big sychronised movement. But in the end, the enemies feel like they aren't made for Dante, and downgrading his moveset to balance it out is kind of a cop out, I understand it's Dante, who never really puts his all into it and just plays for fun, but I just can't get behind the ""DT upgrading style moves"" thing at all. On top of that, Lucifer usually just feels like a placeholder for show, with no real substance to it, but I can say having the three guns is cool. All in all, the mainstay's gameplay is good, not as great as 3 Dante, but good.Now, when we get to Nero, I think he's actually solid as well, but I have to get something out of the way first. First half of the game with him(Takes me like 2:30 with S ranks, I think it's more around 3-4 hours for the real first time) is always painful, but you can lessen the burden if you level yourself in a fashion that allows you to really get in the flow of Nero, stuff like Snatch, Charge Shot, Streak, Split, Air Hike, and Enemy Hike are must haves for the first playthrough(MaxACT, Exceed 2, Exceed 3, and Calibur aren't really feasible to obtain first playthrough without replaying levels or the dreaded return to Nero level) That being sad, his more air based flowchart gameplay isn't bad at all, and you can certainly get creative with the character. What isn't creative is his writing, you have a 30/70 chance of a good cutscene with this kid, really. And by good cutscenes, I mean the DMC3 Dante attitude showing in Nero, with the twist of his abilities. Often times, it's KYRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, showing that Devil May Cry 4 should've been named Devil Will Cry A Lot. Another issue is that Nero feels like he's as unfinished as the Dante backtrack, some of the enviroments, and the fact there aren't any actual alterations as far as I know to the levels they both share. Imagine how Nero would be if HE had buster styles? Buster style switching? There are so many things you can do with a giant blue hand, but Capcom would rather the game release with Nero just using it for masturbation, I suppose.Not only that, but the story feels like a rerun of 3 in a lot of ways and it also hints at a sequel which you know was only because they really really wanted to make more and expand on it, because clearly they weren't satisfied with the time they had. It's a cool game, and it's worth a buy, but it's nowhere near the pinnacle of the series.			",254,44,3,30,11,1,17

												<3 <3 has been my favorite game and one of my earliest :')This and Prototype got me hooked to the video game industry.Ever wanted to get mad and do crazy combos? Well, if you git gud in this game, you're pretty badass. The storyline is kinda linear but the visuals are very very pleasing! Even the cutscenes!You get to play as Nero in the first half of the game(around 12 missions) and the next half(8 missions) as Dante, who's pure badass. This Dante is completely the mature DMC3 Dante. I'm 100% sure he is. As I said before, the combos can get you really pumped and the way Nero uses his Devil Bringer on bosses, is just frigging epic.Finally, I'd like to say that, don't buy this version of the game. Cuz there's the special edition at the same price. It has Vergil in it, if you didn't know :3Also, this is a controller-only game. You can only get those mad combos with a controller. Have fun.

												First off, this version of the game has been made obselete by the Special Edition, which has more playable characters, a couple new modes and more content for your buck. That said, I happened to buy this before the Special Edition came out...and I'm actually surprised that they released an updated version of this game in 2015, because some parts of it are dated as hell. All the standard tropes of PS2-era Japanese action games are on full display, ranging from fixed camera angles, obscenely annoying special missions, arbitrary puzzles (this was always Devil May Cry's schtick though) and a story that's like reaaaaaallly anime, and not in a great way (also Devil May Cry's schtick, with the exception of the third game). But the actual meat and potatoes of DMC4, the stylish combat, is still really good. You've got a crapload of weapons, including my favorite - the Pandora, a transformable suitcase that changes into 666 different types of gun - and switching between Dante's styles or using Nero's devil arm on the fly to throw foes is grand. Only thing is, I would've liked the game more if it had just starred Dante, especially because Dante's levels are a backtracking paltry amount compared to Nero's. Nero reminds me too much of a Final Fantasy protagonist, and part of the joy of DMC is watching Dante take the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything because he knows he's an outrageous demon hunter. Nero just doesn't have that flamboyance, and I get that he was created to draw new players into the series, but because his design is so similar to Dante, you can't help but compare the two. Dante always comes out on top...so it's like, what was the point of putting Nero in there at all?Anyway, still a solid game, though DMC3 remains the king of the pre-reboot titles.			",59,6,0,5,0,0,0

Posted: January 12, 2014
												So I've been a long time fan of Devil May Cry, and I'm probably the only person I know that is. I picked up the first game around the time it came out and died terribly all the way to the second or third-to-last mission, and then I was stuck there for a while. I eventually finished the game, and I stayed a fan of the original even after playing through 2 (note: it's bad...really really bad), and became a bigger fan after playing 3 (my favorite so far). Oddly, 2, 3, and 4 were all directed by the same person, Hideaki Itsuno, though 2 was very different from the rest of the series. After 3 I was definitely willing to give it a go again, so I was very excited when 4 came out. Here I am FINALLY playing it in 2014, almost 6 years after the game came out in 2008, and I thought I'd write up what I thought of the game overall.StoryIn Devil May Cry 4 you play as Nero instead of Dante. Nero is another white-haired sword-wielding Devil Hunter like Dante, but he's younger, likely around Dante's age in 3 which was a prequel. You start out the game with a scene that looks like it came right out of Spider-Man 2 where Nero's on his way to see a girl on stage and gets interrupted by demons. He manages to make it there as the performance ends, and the girl is so happy to see him that there's no real conflict that arrises from it.Nero acts really aloof and stand-offish right away which makes him seem really unlikable, and even whiny. Shortly, though, Dante shows up guns blazing and Nero rises to the challenge of trying to fend him off while everyone else is running around in a panic. From then on Nero seems more and more like Dante himself. Starting with the scene where he's given his sword, and going on to each major demon he faces, Nero keeps up with the wise-cracks Dante is known and loved for, and I actually really ended up liking him as a character as the game went on.Halfway through the game you actually end up playing as Dante for a few missions. There's a lot of fan service here with Dante showing off in every cut scene he's in, with a bunch of silly over-the-top scenes evey time he gets a hold of a new weapon. There's a particularly funny moment when he and one of the villains act like they're in a play when they meet to fight on a stage.Overall I thought the story and characters were well written with the exception of Kyrie, the love interest. Kyrie is the classic damsel-in-distress and you never really learn much about her because she's always either captured and hidden offscreen or oddly mute. The actual plot surrounds a group of people wanting to use Sparda's power to become gods and take over the world which is somewhat similar to the main villain's goal in 3, but there's a little more going on here with more exposition and more characters.DesignThe world design and character design is very similar to the previous games. There are gothic ruins and a city that seems to have a Vatican City vibe to it, as well as a jungle (oddly enough). Characters look similar to what you'd see in 1 and 3, though Dante is sporting a goatee now and a set of boots that look like they may be a little too big. Every female character seems to have spontaneously become extremely well-endowed for some reason, including a couple of returning characters.Creature designs in this game are the best in the series in my opinion. One of the bosses is a giant frog with two lures similar to an angler fish, but the lures are shaped like human women. My favorite design is the Blitz which is a blind demon that uses lightning.The weapon designs are interesting, the two most interesting and ridiculous being Pandora and Lucifer. Pandora is a demonic suitcase that can transform into multiple different guns including a ridable missile platform; yes, I'm serious. Lucifer is a very strange shoulder-mounted weapon that looks like a demon head with bat-like wing/arms. Lucifer allows Dante to create blades that explode a while after being stabbed into enemies, and he can throw the rose he holds in his teeth to manually detonate all of the blades at once; again I'm not making this up.GameplayThe gameplay in Devil May Cry 4 is similar in feel to the rest of the series. Nero has almost the same moveset that Dante does for his standard sword with a few differences. The ability that replace Stinger has an area of effect when it lands, for instance. Nero also gets an ability that gives feedback when there are secrets nearby which is absent when you play as Dante.Nero has two new special abilities that change up combat a little bit. The first is his Devil Bringer which is his demonic right arm. The Devil Bringer allows Nero to pull enemies towards him and perform special grab attacks when their guard is down. This mechanic is easily my favorite addition to combat in this game.Nero's second ability is the EX Gauge which the player has to rev up like an engine to perform more powerful attacks with the sword. I found this ability to be lacking because the extra time taken to charge attacks up didn't seem worth the little bit of extra damage you supposedly got from it. I got into trouble more often than not when using this ability either while revving it up or by missing my charged up attacks.Dante's gameplay is similar to Nero's but it drops the two extra abilities I mentioned previously. Instead of the Devil Bringer grab system Dante gets access to the Style system from 3. This allows him to switch through a larger moveset for swordplay or guns, the Royal Guard style that adds a guard system that gathers energy from blocked attacks into an attack Dante can use against enemies, and the Trickster style that increases movement.Dante gets access to more weapons than Nero, filling in the standard Devil Arm quotient for the game. Overall Dante is the more versitile character, and it feels a little jarring to get used to Nero's fighting style that focuses heavily on the grab-and-throw Devil Bringer, then change to Dante's extended moveset which drops the grab system entirely, and then back again.To unlock new abilities in this game you use proud souls instead of red orbs like in previous games. Red orbs are still in the game and used as currency for items in the shop, and red orbs are still awarded from every enemy defeated and found floating around in missions. Proud souls are only awarded at the end of a mission. A convenient feature is the ability to unpurchase any ability any time you're in the shop which allows you to change your loadout between fights or missions if you would like to try out different abilities.Devil Trigger is available after a few missions, and it is basically the same as usual. Nero gets a couple of extra moves to use.Secret missions return in the game, and remain, in my opinion, uninteresting. They are usually very difficult to complete and give a reward of a blue orb fragment. Occasionally you will come across a secret mission as Nero or Dante that can only be completed by the other character. The game doesn't let you know this is the case, and you have to learn it on your own which can be a little bit annoying.The difficulty curve in this game is high, like the others. There's a point when you have to fight Dante as Nero that took me 2 hours of tries to complete on Devil Hunter difficulty. There's also a couple of strange sections where you roll a die to move yourself around a gameboard to continue on, and because of the randomness of the die this is easily frusterating, especially at the end of the game. There's also a few times where it's hard to figure out exactly what the game wants you to do, but overall I was happy with the gameplay.Final ThoughtsOverall I really liked this game, and I would recommend it to anyone that would like to try it out. Currently in the series I am ranking 3 at the top, trailed closely by 4, with 1 at the bottom. 2 doesn't get to be on the ranking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far, 4.8 hours in, having a pretty good time. Never played a DmC game before, grabbed this one, and I genuinely enjoy it. Although the number of abilities I have unlocked is minimal, the combat still doesn't get old. The boss fights are PHENOMENAL. There's a good amount of strategizing you have to do in them, and quick reaction times are a must along with good sequencing of dodges and attacks. Only thing I don't like at this point is the camera angles are always irritating and you can't control them, and I want more variety in the basic enemies to fight. Oh and getting new abilities takes a hell of a long time to have enough points, but that's not that bad. Will add more to this when I finish.Edit:Finished the game. The ending was a bit disappointing, but still a good game. The combat was a lot of fun throughout, and I figured out what to properly spend points on to make it even more fun. This is one of the few games in my steam library that I've actually finished playing if that tells you anything. Also, Dante is by far the greatest character in any game ever. My reccomendation: if you haven't played the franchise before, and want to get started, this is a good place to start at.			",43,5,2,11,4,0,5

												<3 <3 has been my favorite game and one of my earliest :')This and Prototype got me hooked to the video game industry.Ever wanted to get mad and do crazy combos? Well, if you git gud in this game, you're pretty badass. The storyline is kinda linear but the visuals are very very pleasing! Even the cutscenes!You get to play as Nero in the first half of the game(around 12 missions) and the next half(8 missions) as Dante, who's pure badass. This Dante is completely the mature DMC3 Dante. I'm 100% sure he is. As I said before, the combos can get you really pumped and the way Nero uses his Devil Bringer on bosses, is just frigging epic.Finally, I'd like to say that, don't buy this version of the game. Cuz there's the special edition at the same price. It has Vergil in it, if you didn't know :3Also, this is a controller-only game. You can only get those mad combos with a controller. Have fun.

												I, as I am a personal fan of the series total (Yes, the reboot even... ONLY because it has real life relativities in it, and it is not part of the orig' series), and as I am, I do enjoy the game. No main problems, I am happy that, unlike the Xbox 360 version, that this game not only includes LDK mode, but also keeps further true to the ""Super"" Characters, allowing them to keep more than just Dt (EX: Infinate throttle, infinate disastier gause and royal gauge). But in general, the game is great. Decent story, and the regular and matured Dante, and a neat new guy. (Well, since 2008 new). Some missions are a bit tedious, including the re-loaction of older area's with dante on his missions, but it is still awesome. I reccomend it for those whom: Like action games with a touch of touching, and comedy, like decimating evil, like decimating evil while doing neat actions, havig an actual story (Semi-story, basically, new thing, build up, end) Etc.

												The initial impression of the PC edition of Devil May Cry 4 was a bit disconcerting. Sure, the visuals are breathtaking in high resolution, both throughout gameplay and during the well-directed cut-scenes. You're going to get a kick out of the atmosphere, especially if you're playing the DX10 version. The music, sound effects and voice-overs are top-notch, so no problems there either. The instant disappointment arrived when I tried to maneuver the main character via the awkward keyboard controls.The controls can be adjusted, though I'm afraid this won't help you much. You use the WASD keys for movement, while various actions and attacks are pulled off by pressing a variety of keys with your right hand. As a result, performing combos and stunts proved extremely difficult and to make things worse, they've completely excluded the mouse. Veteran PC gamers won't be too happy about this. To cut a long story short, if you're going to play this game, bring along a gamepad, preferably the X360 controller or one that's similar.Another huge concern is the camera. Frequently throughout the game players just aren't given the best angle to view the situation. There are many sections in the game where you cannot see where the hero needs to jump or where his enemies are. It can be a serious obstacle more often than not.The level designers did a good job of throwing enough challenges Nero's way (and Dante's, of course), although they clearly didn't think about varying things a little, since there are plenty of areas where players are forced to retrace their steps in order to progress.Somehow, even with the faulty controls, this game succeeds in reeling you in with its captivating graphics, stunning artwork and brilliantly designed monsters and characters. The story is, well, baffling to say the least.Trying to decipher what the writers wanted to say may take you forever (a common symptom in Japanese games, yes). Still, the overall presentation is excellent and makes up for the confusing narrative.The well-balanced character powers -- plus, plenty of combos and different melee and ranged attacks -- are the reason Devil May Cry 4 is so addictive. If you're stuck in a certain area, getting through a lengthy platform-jumping sequence or if you're fighting a tough boss battle, it's constant fun and a great challenge. To spice things up for PC owners, the developers fitted on a spanking new ""Legendary Dark Knight"" mode, offering you a chance to slice more opponents than ever before and increasing the challenge further. This is a fine element, but when it comes to PC extras, we kind of expected more from Capcom - essentially, more content, a new chapter in the story, more secret levels and similar things.Devil May Cry 4 is a good game if you're prepared to overlook certain downsides - first and foremost, the controls and camera. Next up, there's a solid amount of backtracking and there are a few recurring boss fights. Even so, the game is well-polished and it certainly looks sharper and better than on the console editions. What's more, it should appeal to fans and newbies alike.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Well, I know that many have reviewed and have said their fair share about this game, but I guess I will share what I feel others should know if there were to think about buying this game. Do I think this game is a good game: Yes, I do. I don't think its the holy grail of the DMC series (not counting the reboot here since I havnt played it as of yet.) But I do find it a great addition to the series. It took me a while to play it merely due to time, but as a vetren of the series of old, I would say that I did enjoy it.How did this game compare to the others: I would say that it would be ranked 2nd out of the 4 main series in my opinion. It is a close first for sure, but there are minor details that just draw it away a little. I havn't gotten a chance to play the Special edition, but this one just did things that went CRAZY! For one, I like the addition of Nero, I did have fun playing as him, and after upgrading alot, loved his devil arm. But I did not have fun with his lack of 'power'. When I say power for Nero, I mean, you remove that devil arm of his and he loses alot of skill. And when you play as Dante for the later half, you realize just how much you rely on that thing for all of his moves or power. Thats not a bad thing, but I feel they could have done a little bit more skills with it besides something like ""hold"" which just allows you to hold an enemy. Maybe something like combing it with your gun or the Yamato more often. Say for example they included an ability that allowed Nero to use his devil arm to grip to the walls, allowing you to be more strategic but perhaps allowing for more skills or combos with it. Dante isnt perfect either though. I love that they allowed all four styles this time around. It was so releaving having those so I could switch from the four at will, instead of having to decide what to use before each mission. His weapons were...okay. I did like to use them, but...some were just more common used from me then others. Lucifer could have been improved more, and Pandora needed to be downgraded to me. It was powerful, but confusing at times when I didn't want something to happen. That and the game didn't explain it that well I feel, (or I was being dumb! Wont question it here XD). The final thing with Dante that just hurt his playing style to me was his actual styles. I feel that they were so much better implemented in DMC3, but got downgraded in this game. Being able to move 3 times in Trickster was my favorite thing, but once, it annoyed me and I felt I could have gotten around situations better without it. Still, the negatives aside, I would recommend this one. Great gameplay, very smooth, and it was just overall fun as heck. Be ready to die though if you think you could play this after coming from DMC3, cause your going to have one hell of a ride! Bit of interest though, I will say, characters were spot on. So yes, if your a fan of the series, or want to get into it, I would say start here, or with DMC1. Then go to 3....2 is questionable. P.S. BUCK THAT FINAL BOSS! I HATE YOU FOR THOSE ATTACKS! <:T)			",49,4,0,5,2,0,1

												If you want to play a hack n slash game with great combat and graphics that still hold up today, you should pick this up. It has a really deep combat system, and it feels very rewarding to get good at the game. The story is pretty barebones, and there is some backtracking (although you play as a different character who plays very differently so I didn't mind much). I also disliked some of the puzzles, but I don't feel like they detracted much from the game, and there are plenty of great boss battles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first, I didn't like this game. Then I plugged in a controller and everything changed. This is a game about killing things, and you have plenty of options for doing so. You could just spam your devil arm, but where would be the fun in that? And it won't give you the dank style bonuses so you can buy more moves. It's fairly acessible to newcomers but fufilling to veterans, and doing a sick combo feels amazing. The only real gripe I have is the camera. Even with the right stick, it moves really slowly and you can't control it at all in certain areas, but it's only an issue occasionally. If you like stylish hack and slashes with ridiculous cutscenes and good graphics, then try this. It's also incredibly well optimized. Now if you'll excuse me, I want to finish this game because it's fun instead of because it's in my unfinished games list.			",94,9,0,4,1,0,1

												      While I will admit that Devil may cry 4 is a great action game it does leave out the things that made previous entries better. Something that DMC4 does better is its story, it is about Nero's search for his love Kyrie after he has been ticked by the order. You will also notice that it is easier than its other games but you can always up the difficulty. One place where the game trips up is that you spend half of the game playing as Nero he does use cool combos but the different weapons made it an icon. Dante is of course the best character and makes the backtracking thourgh similar places with different people worth it. As for the graphics, it could look better but it still looks good but there is the glitch every now and then. The weapons, guns, and styles can now be changed on the fly so thats really helpful.     Devil May Cry 4 is a great action game which has flaws that cant ruin the fun you will have. But those flaws hold it back from being better than 3.8.8/10 ",43,2,2,4,0,0,1

												Before I begin I would just like to say I love the Devil May Cry franchise as a whole (or I would if not for...) and I have played every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.I've played Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 2, Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, DmC Devil May Cry. I've even played the special editions of DmC2 and DMC3 where you get to use alternate characters as a bonus. This however just doesn't cut it, most people would disagree but I couldn't care less because even if I did care it doesn't mean you have to agree with me does it? Anyway, this game is not as good as the other games, the controls are bit crap at times even buggy as well, the godawful camera angles, the character developement is non-existent to be honest, you never really get introduced to a character they just sort of show up in a cutscene, your player character already knows their name and then that's it, no backstory = boring. The female characters are overly sexualized and I'm not insulted by this I just find it unnecessary, I mean they haven't done it once it any of the prior titles or even in DmC Devil May Cry but in this? Gloria, (Spoiler free) Trish, and even Lady are literally nothing more than a display of buttocks and jiggly♥♥♥♥♥♥as soon as they are in a cutscene, they are literally unnavoidable. (Way to use the new physics engine Capcom to show off the power and the hardware it runs on for DMC4 ya ♥♥♥♥♥) Lets not mention the timid Kyrie - Nero's love interest - that can't speak up or seem to use human language to save her life and when she does it's only for nothing more than a few seconds, she's naive, annoying and overall just a pointless character, of course without her as useless as she is like the entire story itself and related characters like Nero, Credo and pretty much every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character and event in the game would be destroyed or not make any sense. The entire game's story being relevant is bargained on the most useless character ever, she's like the ♥♥♥♥♥ from Sonic 06 or the ♥♥♥♥♥ from Resident Evil 4, luckily there isn't a mission where you have to protect her or anything.. Oh wait.. the credits.. which is still lucky because it isn't required to finish the game, only get the secret ending by beating enough creatures.Basically, everything right with DMC 3, was wrong with this game, and at least DmC Devil May Cry (being the reboot that it was) still managed to fix ALL of the issues that DMC4 has and only failing in just very minor ways in similarity to ways DMC 4 did.I reccomend this whole heartedly because if people haven't played it and they want to criticise me or say my points aren't valid, I say buy the game, play it and if you like it fair enough. if you don't then I guarantee you'll understand by the end of it exactly where I am coming from.I bought this on Sale because I didn't like it from the time I initally played it years ago, but I never even got past the first mission or played any more than Bloody Palace mode on it, I neglected it for years and ignored it, I bought and played DmC Devil May Cry after playing and loving the Demo, even though to begin with I wasn't even skeptical about it because I thought I would like it, anyway, someone said to me after they played the Demo and finished DmC Devil May Cry that it ""Wasn't a true Devil May Cry and it didn't deserve to be in the franchise"" whilst DMC 4 which basically was a Reboot anyway due to the fact it includes a new character, new setting, and even a new and more douchey dante, the only thing it has in common with older games is a few characters (that are totally revamped, just like a reboot) and the history hasn't changed that much, somehow did deserve to be in the franchise ""because it felt like a proper Devil May Cry"", before I go further this same person loves Battlefield 4 and thinks there is nothing wrong with it. which is a hilarious statement in itself, my point being I played this game to prove a point, just like he did to prove his point about DmC Devil May Cry (which is still the superior game compared to this crap) I could find any number of reasons to say I dislike DMC 4, but my main one would have to be that it existed..Some people say that DmC Devil May Cry killed the franchise.. But if that's true then DMC4 mustly started working on the gravestone and digging the hole before DmC Devil May Cry was ever even thought of.			",196,13,0,17,10,1,2

												Think of this as Devil May Cry 3 HD: Better Combat Edition. The On-the-fly Style switching was really welcoming after the endearing pain DMC3 gave me on bosses. But honestly, the game just feels easy at some points.So basically, you want endearing difficulty and ferocious enemies, stick with DMC3. If you want a great (AND I DO MEAN GREAT) PC port, great combat, and a little easy with your DMC, then get this. Both are great games anyway.			",637,156,25,56,46,5,74

												First of all, a Hello to all readers of the review. This review was posted once before with the same stuff written down but it was very messy. So I am back to change it and make it better this time.So let us begin.This review is not only about DMC4 but also its prequel of DMC3. I must add that, at the time when I played both games, I didnt own a controller of any sorts. However, I do own a Xbox Controller now which doesnt really help with the games in any way.Now I know that DMC4 doesnt have all that many people to love it for what it is. As with most sequels it doesnt get as much love as the ones that came before. And I can understand that. But in my very own opinion, DMC 4 is a great game. The mechanics, the fighting, the weapons, the characters and the music are just good. Yes, the game can get a bit frustrating for people that only play on Keyboard but you know how it is. Or atleast it was that way for DMC3.When I bought both games, I downloaded DMC3 first. It was finally finished, hit up the next one with a download and started playing the first one. And it was a massive disapointment. I wanted to play DMC3 and not Twister on my keyboard. It went so bad that my I had to rest my left hand because it just began to hurt a whole damn lot. And due to its controlls I could barely get past the first boss, which I in the end did beat, and never get past the second. Overall the game was still very good and I actually watched videos of it in the end because I couldnt play it. Cant say I was disapointed of them. Just wouldve liked to see it myself first time.But then DMC4 was downloaded and I was happy. Atleast more than with DMC3. While the story and all the rest was not as great as DMC3, it was still very much enjoyable. Especially when you get to the point of ... I just realised that, that is a spoiler so I will just shut the hell up about that. Anyways. You get to this point and it just gets better. I have to say though that overall the fighting style, especially against bosses felt more spamhappy than actually skilled fights. Maybe thats just me but that is how I felt.That doesnt mean though that they were not hard to beat. Some of the bosses were quite challenging and when you just thought that you did beat the hardest boss, the next one comes down from the heavens. Those who played through the game will get what I mean.The game recieves an upvote due to the fact that I enjoyed it a lot. I hope this review now, not as messy, can help a few more people than the old one did.Thank you for reading.			",175,46,0,25,15,4,13

												      While I will admit that Devil may cry 4 is a great action game it does leave out the things that made previous entries better. Something that DMC4 does better is its story, it is about Nero's search for his love Kyrie after he has been ticked by the order. You will also notice that it is easier than its other games but you can always up the difficulty. One place where the game trips up is that you spend half of the game playing as Nero he does use cool combos but the different weapons made it an icon. Dante is of course the best character and makes the backtracking thourgh similar places with different people worth it. As for the graphics, it could look better but it still looks good but there is the glitch every now and then. The weapons, guns, and styles can now be changed on the fly so thats really helpful.     Devil May Cry 4 is a great action game which has flaws that cant ruin the fun you will have. But those flaws hold it back from being better than 3.8.8/10 ",43,2,2,4,0,0,1

												NEEEEEERRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TTTTHHHEEEEEE HEEEEEERRRRROOOOOOOOOO!!!In the fourth installment for the phenomenal Devil May Cry franchise, you play as a new protagonist for the series: Nero, who has ties to the same mythological background as Dante. Dante is also playable for segements of the game, and each have their own unique fighting-style that keeps the gameplay from getting stale. Out of all of the installments, this has the absolute best hack and slash fighting mechanics, hands down.As far as ports go, this is fantastic. In my opinion it is much better than the original console release, as it adds a new mode called ""Legendary Dark Knight"" that fills your screen with enemies. I'm not exaggerating...they literally fill your screen.Go butcher some demons!			",176,8,2,13,3,3,8

												I had so much fun with this game it is insane to think I would enjoy a game like this BUT I DID! The combat is so indepth there is so much to learn and so many combos to use. The port was amazing compared to the third which is barely playable without the use of xpadder. The game ran really smooth and the graphics are still amazing for such an old game. The different skills you could learn was also great, I also like the fact you could refund and buy another skill so you could test out different types instead of upgrading something and not being able to change it later.I had so many laughs with the main protagonists (nero and dante) I couldn't even hold myself with laughing at some points not to mention they are both completely badass! I enjoyed all the boss battles they were unique and fun to verse. The story was fairly well done also and It really made me want to play more just to find out what was going to happen. Score:  9/10 was great and definitely worth the money and time I put into it.  ",62,5,0,15,3,0,7

												It's an action-packed, testosterone-fueled game.  Most of the time it gives an impression that it's an horror game due to its creepy atmosphere and level design.  That is, until the monsters show up and the music amps it up in several levels.  It's a horror game alright. but's in the opposite perspective.  It's you, the player, who is the horror in this game.As far as mechanics go, it's quite surprising that several combos can be done in only a single button.  It's all the matter of timing and precision in order to be able to pull these combos off.  Before I started getting this game I've been hearing that Devil May Cry is a masher's game.  There's a lot of mashing alright, but the rewards are higher if the presses are timed properly.As for the stages, it's pretty straightforward and the ""puzzle"" elements are more into proper timing of using the Devil Bringer than anything else.  Some design flaws like bad camera angles can make the game more difficult than it should be.   I'll be updating this once I get to play more missions and unlock other characters.Overall, the game is fun and it's a good respite from games that you take seriously, particularly the competitive ones.

												[Pay no heed to this play time. Trust me, I've played a lot more than what's shown.]While not quite reaching the perfection of DMC3, DMC4 still stands as one of the best of the genre. The tight gameplay, great music and unforgettable characters make this game very worthwhile to pick up if you're a fan of the genre.First off, this game looks gorgeous. The environments are very beautiful, and the setpieces are marvelous. The characters themselves look very good, even though they don't actually look too realistic. For a 6 year old game, the visuals definitely still hold up to this date. Also, this game can run perfectly even on mid-range rigs (my 820m could run it at a smooth 60fps all the way, although at 720p).The gameplay is what really makes this game shine. The controls are very tight, whether you're playing on a gamepad or with a keyboard (gamepad is infinitely better, but keyboard is still great if you're used to it. If you're not, it won't take long to get a grip on the controls, trust me). You never really feel like deaths happen on the game's end, and not on yours. While hacking your way through the smaller enemies is great, the bosses is where this game is at its best. Recognising their patterns and acting accordingly is what it's all about, and it feels seriously good if you manage to pull it off. The gameplay distinction between Nero and Dante is also very good. Both have upsides and downsides, and I can't really choose favourites. Dante is so fun because of his different weapons and styles, and Nero is so much fun because of his Devil Bringer, and the many uses it brings with it. Who you'll like more is all up to you to decide.The only real downside is how Dante's side of the story is a literal backtrack of Nero's story, down to fighting the exact same bosses. This bogs it down quite a bit, as there is a lot of missed potential here. However, fighting these bosses again with a different playstyle does feel fun and refreshing, so that makes up for it a bit. All in all, this game is seriously great. Learning it may be easy and quick, but mastering it to get to the higher difficulties is very difficult and very fun. Pick it up if you like these games. You won't regret it. At all.			",9,2,0,5,1,0,1

												This game's not that amazing, but I really love it. It's not as hard as DMC3, it has less weapons and bosses than DMC3, and you're basically playing half a game twice with 2 different characters. The game also throws a ton of cutscenes at you, when there really is no need at times.Despite everything I just said, the game feels satisfying to me. The combat is a blast, whether you're playing as Nero or Dante, the few bosses this games has are actually really fun, and when you get your SMOKIN' SICK STYLE on you can't help but feel awesome.But seriously, if there's any reason to get this game it's to hear THE TIME HAS COME a thousand times.

I found this game easier than DMC3 to play - and it's not a bad game to start with if yoiu're new to the series.  If you like the hack n slash genre (God of War is also a good example, even though DMC did it first) you'll quite enjoy this game.  Just make sure you have a controller handy.

												I played DMC4 when it first came out on the PS3 a few years ago and have always played the Devil May Cry games on a console. But when it came up on Steam, I had to have it! I've always been a fan of Devil May Cry games.  Packed with fun action, Dante's cheeky wit (although in this case, Nero), great music and cool backdrops, it was more than easy to get back into the game again after not playing it in a couple of years. Plus, I can use my XBOX 360 controller to play, which is even better!  The game is still so enjoyable! Well worth getting if you are a fan and even if you are not, just get it! ;D			",79,22,0,13,11,0,11

												While slightly non-canon to the DMC series, this is quite a beautiful and challenging installment. The battles with smaller demons are very enjoyable, apart from a few ones and some boses which are a bit unfair. The level design is gorgeous, although you'll find yourself backtracking and walking through the same areas time and time again. It has it's flaws, but the overall enjoyment grossly outbalances that.			",536,109,23,20,25,4,34

No reply so I asked once more... I got the same silence so after contemplating for the next several minutes I decided to open the door.My initial reaction was to shoot....BANG...BANG...BANG... I stood in shock as I found out it was my american stepbrother.I was in tears, he was dead, all three of my rounds had entered his heart...but then I looked down he had his laptop in his hands...with this exact game running. He had come over to see if I had bought and downloaded it because this game is so awesome. So I played War of the Roses on his laptop for many hours, over his cold dead body...8/10 Would shoot again.			",111,13,0,13,11,0,6

												I woke up to see this game in the steam store, I quickly downloaded it to see what the hype was all about, as soon as it was downloaded I was about to click the play button when all of a sudden I got a knock at the door, I was startled at first so I jumped up to check the peep hole, and whoever it was on the other side had their finger over it so I got suspicious an grabbed my gun, I yelled ""who's there!?"" No reply so I asked once more... I got the same silence so after contemplating for the next several minutes I decided to open the door.My initial reaction was to shoot....BANG...BANG...BANG... I stood in shock as I found out it was my american stepbrother.I was in tears, he was dead, all three of my rounds had entered his heart...but then I looked down he had his laptop in his hands...with this exact game running. He had come over to see if I had bought and downloaded it because this game is so awesome. So I played War of the Roses on his laptop for many hours, over his cold dead body...8/10 Would shoot again.			",111,13,0,13,11,0,6

												Bought DMC4 tonight. Only played for 3-4 hours. I bought and played the original DMC years ago for the PS2. I remember playing it. I remember really enjoying it. But that was a long time ago. Up through recent years I've leaned more towards 3rd person open world games. But that $5 sale price on DMC4, along with people claiming that DMC4 for PC is the definitive version to have... well, okay, I figured it'd be fun for a bit, if nothing else. Yeah... DMC4 is frickin' brilliant fun!The graphics may be old, but it's a beautiful game. It looks great, plays great, and I can't wait to dig into more DMC4 gameplay. Gems like DMC4 make me wonder what other AAA games I've been missing out on over the years, playing RPGs, MMOs, and such.			",133,18,4,41,16,1,14

												ok , so i managed to finish the 4th dmc game well...the most important thing i found out was the difficulty : it's the easiest dmc game i ever played , because of nero's ability to snatch/buster the thing i liked in this game was the exclusive modes that can be only played in the pc version ^^, and that also gave the modders the chance to unable mods and import them to the gamealso , they added the ability to switch dante's styles , so you can input as much combos as you can :Dwhat else you want more ? that's enough , but its not enough for me , i still encourage capcom to make more of the dmc series , people are still confused about the relation between nero and vergil .....ill give it a 10/10nice gameplay , good soundtrack , awesome graphics ....wow just wow ",576,101,17,61,31,5,60

												I simply love the Hack & Slash style, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was my first game of that kind and after completing it, there was no turning back.DmC 4 itself is decent, the storyline, the music and the gameplay is good enough.I can't say much about how it fits into the DmC continuity itself (I heard stuff though) because that's my first DmC, but if the other titles are only as half good as this one is then they can only be awesome!I'm not much into Capcom games since I only played two Dino Crisis games some time ago, but it's weird at some point how the guys are imitating themselves over and over again with the almost identical core gameplay mechanics (locked cameras,  revisiting certain areas). I can't say that it's not working though. This game really is entertaining because of the spectacular additional combos and epic characterisations (insert a random Dante here) and that very last statement makes me to question the overall point of the reboot's very existence. If you have actually finished DmC 4 you should know what I'm talking about here. It seems that with this game they were intruducing new characters and with it a new story arc which screams for a sequel, but a reboot? Whose idea was to reboot this when they were just about to revive it with some new and interesting stuff? Funny thing is how I'm saying this with DmC 4 being my very first one, so you can't even consider me as a diehard classic fanboy, I'm just being logical here. xD			",92,19,1,1,5,0,6

If this is your first from the series: then buy it. If you played the new game with a controller first  (DmC 2013) from the series: Buy it. If you like different controlls: Buy it. The combat is pretty advanced, and you can easy put hours into them without knowing it.			",175,19,9,25,8,0,22

												If you like fast-paced technical beat-em-ups, DMC4 is probably your best bet until Revengeance gets ported. It's tough without being unforgiving; the kind of difficulty where you'll make a ton of mistakes, get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you, and then the game will ask ""what did you learn?"" Personally, after all these years I still prefer 3, but the PC port of that was made back when Capcom was still in their period of letting one guy at Ubisoft do all the work so it's utter garbage if you can't play it on the PS2. On that topic, the PC version of 4 uses Capcom's MT Framework so it's crazy well-optimized and looks gorgeous even if you have a shitbox.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 20, 2014
												I don't even know how to get started with this game.The story is totally cheesy over the top madness. You play as two demon hunters and guess what? You fight demons and save the world, big surprise. The story is narrated through unbelieveable cutscenes, where the characters get impaled and yet survive, do impossible stuff like deflecting bullets with other bullets, punch a giant stone wall into smithereens, transform a suitcase in a gunship and so on. Big explosions, action and stuff spiced up with crazy music. I was laughing hard during most of these cutscenes. The characters are totally crazy and over the top. There's this guy who wears a red coat and cowboy boots, who would get laughed out of any bar, that's totally crazy. The word is about to be destroyed and he acts all cocky and makes fun of his enemies. The dumbest hilarious cutscene involves him drawing a heart in a hell gate with blade-mines and then make it go boom, while flamenco music plays.The music is terrific, loud and sang with a weird growling voice. The lyrics are beyond redemption and listening to some tracks would make any normal human being flee in terror, and its speed it's well known for causing tachycardia.The gameplay is totally unrealistic. You have these two guys who wield swords as tall as they are and shoot unlimited bullets out of oversized guns. You can do physics defying stuff like launch an enemy in the air, follow it, swing your sword at it a few times, then hover on it showering it with bullets, then hit it some more, then kick its face a few times, plant a few blade-mines on it, then pull out a katana and slash it, then land in a crowd of enemies punching the ground causing an explosion and flip your shotgun at them like a nunchaku while shooting. On top of it, the action is so fast you can't really understand what's going on unless you're pro or someting.There's this kid that's like the sheer power character. He can ""act"" his sword to make it ignite and spinning through the screen covered in fire, charge up gun shots to make groups of enemies explode and has the ability to execute high damaging grapples on foes. Than there's this other guys that has five ""styles"" that you can switch on the fly and every stile changes the function of your ""style button"" according to your equipped weapon. And speaking of weapons oh boy, this guy is a walking army, he has 3 melee weapons and 3 ranged ones and one of them has 4 normal firing modes. All of this stuff makes this guy incredibly complex to use. I mean, who needs all that variety? The combat system let's you pull out some infuriatingly complex combos if you are skilled enough but who cares?! Why can't I just spam Y and get SSS ranking?!Every mission gives you a rank, that is a combination of diferent factors. I hear crazy fans actually play to best each other scores, while I can barely survive.There's a lot of enemy variety, and some of them require special mechanics to be defeated or are generally better dealt with with specific tactics, forcing you to think fast and pick your target carefully. Who the hell wants to think when playing a game?!Did I mention that the game is incredibly hard? Because it is. If you never played an hack&slash you could even die on the second level boss! What madness is this? And, once you complete the game, you can start all over INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY! Who in their right state of mind would make things even more challenging than they already are?! Also, you unlock a game mode that essentially is a restless battle, not even one single platform section!Did I say the game had 2 harder difficulty modes? Sorry I meant 3, because the PC version pushes things even further with a mode where you fight an INSANE amount of enemies, like the ones you fight in Human mode weren't enough. Also, to make things even more frantic and hard, PC version adds  turbo mode that makes everything run faster. Unbelievable.So, for all of these reasons, I declare this thing one of the best games ever made. Played back then on my deceased ps3, still playing it today on pc, listening to its amazing songs, enjoying its hilarious characters and having fun with the new game mode and the turbo function the excellent PC port provides. Too bad they couldn't finish the game properly but I think that just the Bloody Palace is more then enough to justify the price tag. It aged well... actually, it doesn't feel the age at all, it's waaay better than 99% of the crap we get today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game with the most responsive & best feeling fighting controls of any game ever.  I have never played any game that felt even remotely as close in terms of freedom or creativity - the scope of combos is infinite (watch any combo video) and it feels like there is always room to get better and more inventive.  Every game I play, I wish the controls handled more like this game.  Not much in terms of story here but truly the best fighting gameplay that exists.  Every other fighting game wishes it handles like this game does.  That being said, don't buy this version of the game.  Go buy the special edition.  Similar price but adds 3 more playable characters (2 of which share no combos or abilities with any characters in the game... Trish has some of her moveset borrowed from Dante.)			",90,8,0,20,9,0,15

												It feels so good, to be this demonic...I've waited for Devil May Cry 4 to come out ever since it was announced that it will be released in a few months time, but I did not have a PS3 neither did I had a good pc for this. But now I get to enjoy such a privilege as to play as Nero, the heavy-hitting, demon-smashing, swoosh-slashing, son of a gun Devil Hunter! (hence my name: FrostNero)11/10 > Absolute recommend. Even if its already been a few years after the release, the replay value is so damn high for me.Ohh, and this beats DMC 5 hands DOWN!			",113,8,0,8,7,3,1

												I barely recommend it at $5 or less. 14 hours of gameplay accumulated. Steam didn't track all of it.I'm a big fan of DMC3 and I mildly enjoyed the original. I feel like this project completely missed the mark in almost every possible way. I was extremely warm on it for the first few hours but it quickly wore out it's welcome.Now, it's visually stunning, and the PC port is flawless and enhanced. That's just dandy. But the mechanics in this game just do nothing for me. I can't stand playing as either Nero or Dante here. It just doesn't quite feel right, and many of the new moves and weaponry just seem like half-baked♥♥♥♥♥♥they chucked at a wall to see what would stick. Very little of it does.I didn't give half a care about the story from start to finish, and I ended up just uninstalling the game at the 2nd to the last boss and watching the ending online. The cutscenes are completely mind-numbing and over-the-top in ways I never thought imaginable, this side of the Metal Gear Solid remake Twin Snakes. They don't seem to realize that the stupidity of DMC3 was charming, but you can't just make it twice as stupid and expect it to be twice as entertaining. Every ounce of this story, dialog, and even motion capture and character body language is painfully annoying. I cringed for hours upon hours watching this game unfold. I can only assume this is yet another case of lost in translation, but I've never seen an entire cast of characters say so many words without telling me ANYTHING. Japan. Just stop.I would suggest you only play on the easiest difficulty and blast through it on automatic mode as a button masher. It's not at all worth learning how to properly play the game. I don't care about the combo system at all, and it becomes essential to beating most bosses without cheaping your way past them with health items. I only ever beat one challenge stage, for this reason. I will never understand how someone can stay airborn for 30 seconds in a DMC game, and frankly, I shouldnt have to learn. I should just be able to enjoy the game to completion.I'm eager to move onto the DmC reboot. At least it looks like it's more tuned in on an English audience and typically when a fanbase hates an entry to a series I'm sick of, it means I'll end up liking it for it's fresh ideas.

												7/10Story isn't bad. graphics are beautiful, and levels are nice looking.I read it is hard to play on steam, but it works fine for me. All in all that game isn't terrible, no such thing as a terrible DMC game. But definately my least favorite. I find Nero as a boring character to have to deal with.. Plus the skill system I find stupid. I will only play this maybe once or twice. I'd say you have a 50/50 shot of liking it.			",157,7,1,15,4,1,3

												This was the first DMC game I ever played, so it holds a special place in my heart. Since then I've played all the games (except the newest DMC for certain reasons <_<) and have become a huge fan of the series since then. Among the four I've played I would say... this one is second best, with DMC 3 taking first. The beautiful graphics, the music, the voice acting, the dante, and THE COMBAT!!! ohhh the combat (drools).  I gotta say I wouldn't mind if nero got his own prequel/sequeal. 8/10(this game only get negative points for doing all the same levels twice but with different charactors)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Devil May Cry 4, also commonly known as Yaoi Boyz, is the tragic story about a young man whose masturbation arm one day turned into a powerful weapon for helping demonic entities getting their rocks off. Yaoi Boy (officially named ""Nero"") jerks off enemies big and small alike, using abilities like ""Snatch"" and ""(nut) Buster"" (although Buster is used far more often as there are few female enemies in the game that attract Yaoi Boy's attention) to make your enemies climax.Yaoi Boy eventually meets the series' main protagonist, Yaoi Man, and has a hot showdown that about 3000 DeviantArt members have effectively chronicled every aspect of. When you eventually get to play as Yaoi Man, you'll notice that you actually don't jerk demons off, but engage in BDSM until they either die or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ again. Yaoi Man loves to get skewered by pointy objects, whether they be swords or something else. You'll see this happen to him at least once in every game. He is truly both a masochist AND a sadist.But I digress. There is actually a newer version that includes both the Yaoi Man's brother, Sesshomaru, and the two female characters, the Yuri Gurlz. Yaoi Boiz (Yuri Gurlz special edition) is a real treat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands-down one of my least favorite games in the main series, but damn! If it isn't an amazing port, albeit the controls are wonky, I don't know what else to say.

												There isn't a whole lot to be said that hasn't already been said. This game is good. Really good. It's a hack and slash that bases itself in ridiculousness. There are more ways to take out your foes than French restaurants have ways to say, ""Your taste in wine is atrocious."" Excellent combat, great soundtrack. The cutscenes are actually enjoyable to watch and are not prerendered; They use the in-game engine, which is as detailed as it is colorful, a refreshing change of pace from other games of its generation. In terms of port quality, it's beautiful. Even on my absolute toaster of a computer, the game manages to stay at around 85 frames per second, even when the screen is crowded with baddies with the PC exclusive Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. The keyboard controls won't do you well, however. I'd recommend getting an Xbox 360 controller, which is nearly perfect, except for two points I'll get to later.The game has a ton of replay value. Aside from Bloody Palace, there are a plethora of unlockable moves, difficulties, and artwork/biographies, but I have to note that the latter is stuff that anyone can find in a quick search on Google. Really, the most rewarding part of this game is the game itself, and overcoming the increasing challenges it throws at you by practicing and mastering the combat. Even after beating everything the game keeps track of with an S rating, I still don't feel like I'm as good at it as I could be, and this is a welcome feeling to have.Cons: Aside from fewer style moves than in DMC 3, the biggest issues I noted were- The camera. It gets stuck on scenery and can get jammed into places that make it impossible to see what you're doing (especially during boss battles). The targeting is also a pain. It seems that no matter which of the targeting modes I choose, I can never lock on to the enemy I want. When the camera and targeting issues combine, combat feels much harder than it should be.-The length. The various difficulty options are a blast, but the core game is just too short. 20 missions, okay, but 3 of them are only boss battles. Dante is fun to play as, but he only gets 7 missions, and most of them are backtracking. The one unique boss fight he gets is its own level and can be completed in about 10 minutes. It feels like two halves of a game are slapped together here, with Nero missing a big chunk of missions and Dante not having much of an opportunity to show off his insanely large moveset.- The controller. I know, I know, it's not really a criticism of the game, but I know that most people are going to be using an Xbox 360 controller with this, and while it is the best of the controllers I tried, it has issues which negatively show in the game. The D-pad is horrid, it makes instant style switching with Dante touchy to the point that combos will be screwed up. Nero is another problem. I found myself doing ""the claw"" with my right hand many times during combat, as I was charging the exceed meter, charging the gun, adjusting the camera, and dodging attacks at the same time. Changing the controls only helps so much; There is simply too much going on at one time for the few amount of buttons on the controller.It's pretty fun, and this is where I'd crack a joke about it being like Dark Souls with less anime, but it's interesting I should bring up Dark Souls, because...I got this just before DMC 4 Special Edition was announced, which is set to come out this summer, and is going to be offered as its own thing. If you pay for this version now, you're not getting the full deal which comes out in a matter of months. As such, I have to strongly suggest just waiting for SE.			",120,19,3,24,14,0,4

												This game is actually pretty darn good and fun.  While maintaining the aspects which makes Devil May Cry a great game, this game also acts as a bridge between DMC1 and DMC 2 plotwise.  It is a joy to play, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of Bayonetta or any other Devil May Cry game.Still, the first playthrough could be considered to be a bit on the easy side.  However, being able to access Dante Must Die difficulty right off the bat kind of counters this thoroughly.  Plus, the second playthough is where the true meat of this game lies.And again,PLEASE buy a gamepad first.  Playing on the keyboard is a pain.			",302,33,0,34,18,1,53

												Great game that looks great in DX10 but beware it might require you to uninstall a microsoft windows update cause it did cause me to crash during some cutscenes. But other than that its super hype DMC classic fun slightly easier than i remember but bosses are challenging to say the least and the Voice acting on nero is amazing everytime i hear his voice (Johnny Yong Bosch). matched with great cutscenes, fluid combat, challenging boss's, decent custimization. Def grab when on sale with DMC 3 or just grab if you want a great game. Go back to the roots and find out why fans didnt like the new style DMC!!!!(Which i didnt find that bad tbh)			",208,17,0,28,3,0,11

												[POTENTIAL SPOILER] Don't get fooled by the year this game was made, it looks B E A U T I F U L. This game introduced me to the DmC franchise and did that well. It features unlockable history about the games and showed some of the core gameplay in a very good tutorial. The camera took me some getting used to, but I got over that real fast.The core gameplay is that you just go and slash at everything that stands in front of you. You learn combo's and handy tricks as you play the game, but then... In the middle of the game you change back to Dante, the character from the past games. And you play through the game backwards, fighting all the bosses over again with new weapons.The controls are very good (from what I can see using a controller) and is real fun to use. If you play the game on DX10 the games resolution gets fixed as without it it is locked (for me) to 680x480. The game runs great and is really worth the price tag.9/10 Great game, maybe even one of the best I've ever played!			",151,11,0,17,5,1,13

												With the upcoming Special Edition, I can't say I suggest you buy this version.But, it's one of the best games of all time.  Hindered in many ways by production, it fell short of what it could have been, with the backtracking and all the junk I'm sure is mentioned elsewhere in other reviews.  That said, even with its flaws, it's simply one of the deepest combat systems one can find, especially on the PC.  Arguably worse than Devil May Cry 3 in some respects, but honestly the PC version of DMC3 is junk.  Move along on that one.I could write essays about this game, spending much more time on it for the 360 originally, and sadly being a bit burnt out by the time I played it on PC which is the definitive version.  I won't be writing those essays, and I'll sum it up right quick:Play this game, wait for the special edition, but play it.  You can't do any more of a disservice to yourself than to ignore one of the best series to ever grace video games.  It's what games should be, giving the player freedom to create, rather than giving stagnant dial a combo gameplay seen in too many other games.			",208,23,5,27,5,0,13

												Devil May Cry 4 is an amazing hack-and-slash game that is easy to learn and hard to master. The combat system is very in depth and there is always more room for improvement, even for the greatest masters of the game. It also has many different difficulty levels that will keep you busy for HOURS. You get to play as either Nero, who has a very interesting combat system because of his grab ability, and Dante, who has a variety of weapons and fighting styles to choose from while in game, giving an indefinite number of possibilities for combos. Plus, the game is very pretty, even on the lowest graphics settings, and for a PC port, it is not that bad.Now here's the part where you yell at me for stating my opinion. My main criticisms of the game lie heavily in the story, which I honestly believe was bland and tasteless. Dante isn't the main character, but instead, it's Nero, who in my opinion, acted too much like a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (though his combat is very unique). A majority of the characters are completely one-dimensional and don't really serve any purpose other than being the damsel in distress or the power-hungry bad guy or the envious rival . I pretty much only enjoyed the parts of the story where Dante was included because at least he was cheeky in an enjoyable way. Although I liked Nero's combat style, it got old for me pretty quick. Other downsides include the camera problems (which I am pretty sure is typical for a Devil May Cry game), a lack of costumes, the hideous amount of backtracking which puts Dante's role in the game to shame (I am talking you're backtracking for almost HALF THE GAME), and the lame final boss whose attack patterns are very predictable. Plus there's not much innovation put into the level design, which brings me back to the backtracking issue. I honestly felt like I was playing a somewhat incomplete story.Overall DMC4 was a mostly fun ride from start to end. It does bring back Bloody Palace as well as has a couple fun bosses. What it fails at in areas such as level design and completeness, the game makes up for it with an awesome combat system, beautiful visuals, and long playability. It wasn't as good as Devil May Cry 3, but better than DmC Devil May Cry.Overall I give Dante May Backtrack 4 an 8/10TL;DR The gameplay is amazing, but the story was very lackluster and unfinished			",76,7,0,6,7,0,1

												Aw yeah, good ol´ DMC. Its really different then the new one, I still like both....but this.. fixed camera angles, old Dante, Nero and the awesome DMC universe. I wish this old story could continue in next games.This game has a special place in my collection. And when I have finally the chance to have it in my steam library it can be with me forever..I forgot to mention awesome graphics...The story.. its a classic story - here is your character, go and save the girl. ""Japan"" .. well okay, you begin the game as Nero, he is young, mysterious boy and a quarter-demon. First, he is ordered to find and capture Dante, but it becomes more complicated.. and here comes the save-the-girl part. In the second part of the game, you will be switched to Dante and your task will be save Nero. Its ehm..game full of saving people, awesome boss battles and annoying demons trying to kill you.I still like it, when you see Dante you will be 100% sure he will say something stupid and you will smile.I still recommend picking this game up on sale tho, because 19.99eur is too much.

												Yes, you play a bland, uninteresting character for the first half of the game. Yes, the story is really stupidly convoluted. Yes, playing Dante's half of the game includes going through the same exact levels but backwards. Once, you get to Dante, it is incredibly fun and the combat system is completely solid. Even Nero can be fun to play and it's even friendly newcomers to the series. Better yet, the PC port is just completely solid as well. It even has a Performance Test feature. I mean, can you name other PC games that has this feature? So, when you play this game, keep the first three problems in mind because those can really hamper the experience. It's either this game or get the DMC HD Collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doesn't bring a whole lot new to the DMC series but a fun entry nonetheless. Nero isn't the most pleasant protagonist but he's tolerable and the game is pretty fun. Devil Bringer is an enjoyable feature but the fact that Nero lacks the tricks that Dante has means that fighting enemies you can't use devil bringer on is irritating, and going through the levels as a character without devil bringer (Dante) is a bit simplistic since you can't do any of the platforming/puzzle solving bits. Overall though a solid game.			",228,19,0,21,10,1,36

DMC4 was like putting ice cream on top of the cake, delicious. I was iffy about Nero, and he's different than Dante, but that isn't bad. He's a hot-headed, cocky, badass and has a good arsenal of moves. Unlike Dante, he has no weapons to unlock. Dante, however, has unlockable weapons and the awesome on-the-fly Style switching system. Nothing beats kicking♥♥♥♥♥while using Trickster to dodge everything, while throwing in some Dark Slayer Style or Swordmaster.

												My first impression when I started playing DMC4 three years ago was, ""Wow, this is very Capcomish"". The 3D character models have a very arcadish quality appearance. Most levels despite having poor texture upon closer inspection look eerily detailed and realistic like Resident Evil 2 for its time. There is a lot of cinematics with female characters that show off their sex appeal. For some reason it made me laugh hard, but in a good way.There are some horrible viewing angles as the camera is either static or on rails. But it's not frustrating and sometimes you may rotate the camera via arrow keys.There are no auto-saves, so you've got to be careful, because you can easily forget to manually save. I felt like for every hour spent playing, it felt like 3 hours had elapsed.I began resuming this game from Dante (about 60% in) a few days ago. Controls were easy to pick up again. There is also a very light cash-in advancement RPG skill system in place.A simple but decent game even for 2013.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The replay value is really high, having many difficulties, different characters, and secret mini missions. The story isn't the strongest factor, but it isn't that bad.

												A pretty fun hack-and-slash game. Strongly recommended!Haven't tried much of the other games and not the latest one either. Can still say that this is one of the best hack-and-slash games though. Can be some graphical glitches here and there though, but nothing to big of a problem.I give this game 7/10,			",772,146,31,93,83,11,95

												As you can see i don't have much time on this game, but i have just recently completed the whole game. But between DMC 5 and DMC 4 they are very different, these are the only two i have played so far but i have to say i like DMC 5 better, to me its more fun and it makes more sense for DMC to be that type of game and it felt like it worked better than the style this game takes. But still this game is very good i just find the other one more action packed i should say and it ended up being more satisfying. i also liked the style of DMC 5 better too, i like how its a modern style rather than gothic and i like the young dante best he was cocky and funny as hell.(i also hate nero he's like a dante wannabe, dante is way better)Result: 8.5/10I'd reccommend this game any day			",110,14,0,27,12,0,8

												This Game is amazing the combat and maps are varied and it is extremely good overall. I love the story and the gameplay a ton.While i have to admit that this game is amazing and is extremely fun I hate this game for 2 very infuriating reasons. THE SAVE SYSTEM IS TRASH and the game crashes a lot. While playing the game the saves would not save half of the time and i had to find another persons save online in order to continue playing from my current mission. Also the game would crash causing the mission not to save which was extremely annoying. These two issues aside it is a amazing game. Id reccomend waiting for the special edition but this is still worth it. I give this game a 8.5/10			",436,91,10,27,28,4,38

												Over all I found this game to be a lot of fun:  it has a fairly diverse set of moves,   the two characters have different play styles,   (which add a level of diversity)  and the story was fairly entertaining.   (if you play fighting games for the story)The only complaints which I have are:  the frequent use of fixed camera angles can make navigation problematic,  the jumping feels a little odd,   (at first, but it's not a big problem)  on higher difficulties two of the enemies become intensely frustrating and you need to beat them to continueThis game is for those want a difficult and complex 3rd person brawler.  If that's not you then under no circumstances should you a pre-reboot ""Devil May Cry"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The absolute top in its genre. No other game can compare to the sheer depth of the skill sets of Nero and Dante. However, the game was neutered at development and is a half finished game. It's tolerable for the sweet sweet gameplay. I personally prefer Dante over Nero and his skillset just gives the game life. The game is cheap and definitely deserves your attention.

												I actually always wanted to play this game since the day it came out but only recently got the chance last summer. I've clocked in only about 50 hours or so but I enjoyed most of it. Aside from the unforgiving camera angles at times, this game is really enjoyable. The combat system is so complex I found myself just repeating levels in order to find a nice combo that suited me and killed my opponent in one go. If this game is on sale, I suggest buying it. The special edition will be a better idea since it has everything in this game AND some more.			",62,1,1,5,2,0,1

												A short rundown of the game: Default controls suck, works great on my machine.Currently, I'm running Linux so this review is from memory. This is also my first ACTUAL review.Personally, I give this game an 8/10 with the following reasons:Good charactersFun bossesDecent graphicsDante's weapons. Need I say more?Nero's screaming for KyrieAlright, so playing this game my first order of business was to edit the controls. Normally, people complain about the controls of every single game that was created for the console and put on a PC; this game was very simple for adjusting controls, but really wanted you to work for it when it came to playing. I could go on about the controls in the game, but let me say this: I got to a point where the way I adjusted my controls made the game better than what it was AFTER I got my PS3 controller to play it with. Yep. I made the game better on the Keyboard than on the Controller. In Dark Souls, that'd be IMPOSSIBLE; in this game, it's pretty easy. This game earns a 10/10 for controls on that alone.Now, not to spoil the game with the story of it, I'm only going on the gameplay aspect; you want the story, use google. I played this game entirely for the gameplay. Nero is pretty simple to control, but if you're using an older machine, you're going to have serious problems. The lag extremely effects how well you react; most times you can simply press a button when a game a local-based lags on your computer and it will slowly move. In DMC4, if you press anything, the lag actually makes the game ignore your command entirely. Backwards compatibility, I label this a 4/10.The biggest problem I had with this game is that Nero has limited weapons but does 3x as much damage as Dante, so killing as Dante takes a long time. Also, if you're new to the game, Dante will make you cry when you're fighting against him; this is coming from a guy who beat Heaven and Hell mode on DMC3 once. Dante will actually gain ALL of his weapons after you beat the game once; and believe me, he'll use them against you on the first stage of your next game. Dante also has a tendency to avoid whatever you throw at him unless you force him on the offensive and dodge his attacks yourself. Even then, he's faster than Nero, so good luck. And on your second playthrough, the first level turns out to be a major challenge. I didn't bother with Heaven or Hell mode for this exact reason. 3/10 on difficultyAfter level 1, the game is pretty enjoyable so long as you play as Nero. However, when you switch to Dante, everything becomes a major challenge. The lag becomes real, damaging enemies becomes tedious and to replace the cool minigames Nero had, Dante has immediate danger and headache inducing puzzles 24/7; in one level, all areas that were connected are redone to have portals replace the connections between them. Basically, you're going to go through a new maze a la Silph Co. teleporters. Oh, but these aren't exactly connected to each other; you can go into one and then decide to backtrack and come out of a totally different portal then the one you walked through. If you're like me and get busy playing games, this is a struggle.The game has a random scene with nothing but inuendos for no apparent reason whatsoever.Aside from that, this game was good. I don't like to praise good games or attack bad games, more show a contrary side to my own opinion. If you want my controls, message me. They worked exceptionally.			",105,20,2,35,13,0,39

												[Edit: Commenters have brought it to my attention that my complaints regarding the controls are only applicable to the first half of the game. If you spend several hours pushing past the cumbersome nature of Nero's controls then a more versatile control scheme will eventually be made available.]My complaints regarding DMC4 would probably be numerous if I played it more, but as it stands there is only a very, very big one.There are unused controller buttons and yet they didn't see fit to assign one to a dedicated dodge. Dodging requires three parts of input: simultaneously lock on to a target, press sideways on the thumbstick (never forward or backward, thus limiting the locations you can dodge to), and press the jump button. If you can do this all at exactly the same time you will then dodge relative to the target you locked onto, and not the fixed-place camera, making it even more unwieldy. This absolutely baffling design decision made the game too frustrating for me to persevere with.I appreciate that Devil May Cry is a hardcore title for hardcore gamers with hardcore skillz in hardcore places, but turning something as elementary as dodge into a ♥♥♥♥ing combo move is just beyond the pale. I'm surprised they didn't turn jump into some crap involving three rotations of the thumbstick while chanting Hare Krishna.			",222,128,2,34,19,1,38

The PC Port for controlling is abit confused unless you have a Xbox 360 Controller (Mine was a PS3 Controller) The puzzling is good though, Comboing with Dante and Nero are really interesting actually, It Keeps your mind going. I would recommend this if you like a decent DMC game that has repeitive bosses and Good storyline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 After a few tweaks to fix constant crashes I've found that the game's well optimized, Nero's fun to use once you get the hang of him, Dante's personally more fun because of his wide array of moves though you only use him in a little less than half of the 20 missions, a lot of the running around bits are boring, and though there aren't many bosses because you go against (most of) them twice with two different characters they're still cool to fight.That said there's almost no point to getting this when the Special Edition is supposedly better aside from it being somewhat less optimized to this.

												The Good:- Sound and graphics are damn good, even for my not so leet machine- The presentation of the game is just superb, voice acting is triple A- The menu is tieded up and well sorted- An awesome intro and a lot of perfect cutscenes- Gameplay is extremely fluid- The camera is never in the way and focussed on the actionThe Bad:- For a bad gamer like me it seems to be a very long road to achieve some things, like getting orbs and stuff (for buying better equipment and upgrading)- No blood and gore- The gun does almost no damage- Stupid, cryptic levels which can become extremely annoying when you're not a pro gamer. Like the torture chamber in the second/third level. I was not able to beat this, so I'm already stuck at the very beginning of the game. Hurray.Even when I give a thumb down, I do recommend this game, since not everybody is a gamer without skills like me. Enjoy! :)			",224,20,13,20,11,1,19

												This game is beautiful and plays well but there are 2 things that make this game so awful and its the camera angles, they were created by Satan himself and the save spots, litterally that is the only thing that makes this game so bad and unbarable you litterally have to play a good some amount of time before you can save. And the thing that pisses me off the most is I can't even beat the game because there's NO hint system on what to do it pretty much throws you into something and is like well have fun figuring out what you gotta do and have fun backtracking asshat, so I wasted 6 hours of my life on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥10/10 game sucks ♥♥♥ and I want my money back.

												Meh.Fights feel repetitive and boring. Enemies mostly stand around and attack you one at a time. There is like ONE battle soundtrack that loops after like 90 seconds, but you'll rarely hear more than the first 20 seconds because of how short the fights are. Combat itself can be fun after you figure out a few combos, and the bosses are pretty neat. The characters are basically just a bunch of clichés lumped together.I guess it's not a *terrible* game, but there are just so many better games out there. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I enjoyed this game, this game has some of the best combat in an action game, lots of depth, very fun, and responsive. Everything about the combat feels right. But then you get about 4 hours in and have to replay the same levels you just played but just in the reverse order. I thought hey, this is just temporary. And switching from Nero to Dante made it somewhat fresh to play the levels again. But no no, it was not temporary. The game kicks into full lazy mode by making you fight the bosses you just fought as Nero again with Dante. But then it gets somehow lazier when it makes you switch back to Nero again in the last two missions, one of which is a boss rush mode against bosses you've fought twice before now. Just in the end, I don't enjoy replaying the same levels twice just in the reverse order. Beating the same bosses three times is just boring. And reusing so much content is just poor design. While there's a good ammount of fun to be had, there's also a greater ammount of monotony to suffer through.5/10 okay			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DMC4 has similar issues. If it is that hard to get  proper key bindings for a game, so people cannot even start to enjoy it, better to avoid buying it and warning people to stay clear... beware of buying CAPCOM nice price stuff while not owning a standard (US-)keyboard and having to possibility to change bindings....

												First off, before you even start this game, don't expect to play without a controller. It's a pretty crappy port. Secondly, once you have a controller to play the game with any decent control, you will recognize that this is a bland, dry, and slow-paced ""action"" game starring an insufferable protagonist and little to no challenge. Playing this game felt like a chore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh darn. DMC4 crashed on me again. What ever shall I do? I suppose I'll just have to uninstall it, because it has more/longer cutscenes than a FF or MGS game, and it's really being stingy with the upgrades to let me do cool things, even though I can sit there and watch my character do them over and over in the endless 10 minute cutscenes. It probably gets better once it bothers to let you have skills other than ""mash buttons until things die"", but when the number of times it's crashed to desktop is higher than the number of levels I've played, I'm not going to keep going and find out.

												I bought this game expecting some mindless hack-and-slash fun but instead I was running around with nothing to fight most of the time. Instead, you spend a bunch of time trying to figure out how to grapple to that platform, pushing around cubes to  unlock a door, searching some bland castle for orbs to unlock some skills, or just back-tracking trying to figure out where you are supposed to go next. There was very little to keep me interested for very long. This game plays like a mediocre early PS2 era game. For $5 you could do worse, but if you have a backlog don't bother with it.

												I couldn't even finish this game.I had heard so highly of it so I was very excited to start playing. Then I realised the cinematice are plentiful and so over the top it's stupid, and I'm a big fan of Bulletstorm so that's saying a lot. The combat was mediocre and the entire experience seemed entirely focused on shoving how ""badass the protaganist is"" in my face. It just seemed like a love letter to the most hardcore anime lovers and that was all.So if you're one of those people that will like almost any anime inspired creation just because it's anime, go ahead and get this, you'll love it. For everyone else, just watch some youtube reviews. I sure wish I had.			",131,19,1,15,2,2,7

												What a fakk nugget of a game. Finally finished it so I can post a review. Please be advised that I'm an avid DMC fan and finished the infamous DMC3 a couple of times, so my opinion is valid.First, let's get the good stuff out of the way: Spectacular graphics, smooth framerate, the combat is OK, some amazing fight choreographies. Done.The bad I will bring to you in the form of a dialogue between the two lead designers. If it helps think of them as Gonad ((c) by Yahtzee) and Testy.A: ""Let's make DMC4.""B: ""K. Sounds like $$.""A: ""Sure is. Let's be careful not to make it too easy. We want g4m0rz-moneys and they like it rough.""B: ""K, but first things first. Dante or someone new?""A: ""Dante AND someone new! Damn, I'm good.""B: ""Hmm why not. How should he look, behave, talk and fight?""A: ""Exactly the same.""B: ""What, really? Won't that confuse and annoy the players?""A: ""Te he, it's so devious. Let's make everything extra annoying so people play it because it's hard and not because it's good. Do you remember those special missions that allow you to earn blue orbs?""B: ""Fcourse. I never liked that when you lost energy during those missions that the damage wouldn't carry over to the normal gameplay.""A: ""That's what I was thinking. Make it permanent. Oh, and if you buy something, make EVERYTHING ELSE MORE EXPENSIVE!""B: ""Excuse me?""A: ""As soon as you buy something, everything else get more expensive. Every single time you buy something.""B: ""...""A: ""It's ingenious! So annoying. Players won't be able to plan any purchases beyond the first one. Gnahaha...!""B: ""Consider it done. I assume we include incredibly frustrating jump sequences from beyond hell with fixed, bad camera angles, respawning enemies and so on for maximum annoyance?""A: ""DO YOUR WORST! Oh, and how about enemies that have an unblockable attack while down with no tell whatsoever that disrupts your combo while you are slashing them? That should take care of those uber-gamerzz.""B: ""Sounds a bit extreme and unlike DMC to me, but OK. Oh, oh, I always wanted to include a board game segment into a video game. Something where you don't have any control and it just annoys you and goes on forever with seemingly endless enemy hordes spawning again and again and again and-""A: ""Stop, I get it, I get it. Why not include it in two places, one right before the end. Make that extra annoying, like an hour or so to beat.""B: ""An hour? Are you sure? Or do we now allow saves within a level when quitting the game?""A: ""Are you CRAZY? Once the g4m0r shuts down the game he has to do the whole level again. That goes without saying.""B: ""What if he's right before finishing this annoying herpderp fakksheet board game level and suddenly has to quit beacuase of real life and stuff?""A: ""Well, then he would have to deal with the unfairness. He's gonna hate it, he's gonna love it. How long can the game be with our current budget?""B: ""About 9 hours.""A: ""No, too short, not annoying enough. Backtrack the whole game. Make the player defeat the bosses THRICE.""B: ""I'm not sure about that. It sounds very excessive, and even the most hardcore gamer hates backtracking.""A: ""SILENCE! BACKTRACK! EVERYTHIIIING.""B: ""You got it. Couple of things that I think you'd like.""A: ""Listening.""B: ""Manual saving. I know it's the new millenium, but how peed on would you be if you beat an annoying level and forgot to save especially if you are pumped up after playing, just clicked continuecontinuecontinue when in fact you'd had to go down with the cursor to manually save.""A: ""Love it.""B: ""The program will read Window's language and put the game in that with no option to change it whatsoever. It will take 9 button presses to quit. Oh, and the story will OF COURSE be totally bananas with no plot, people just appearing, disappearing and fighting, and the player will trudge through shity, blocky environments with no idea why he does that or where he should go next.""A: ""I give you a raise.""FAKK. THIS. GAME. It is an amalgamation of some of the most HORRIBLE design choices I have ever encountered in a triple-A game. Lawd knows what shrooms the makers have fumed when they brainstormed about how the game will be. This is an insult to gamers. Play only if you absolutely cannot live without Devil May Cry, have beaten the third one countless times and cannot get into the new DmC (which I very much like, btw). DMC4 is such a soulless, lazy, uninventive and so very, very much annoying cashin of a game that it's not even fun to beat it to prove your skill.			",219,31,2,8,11,1,21

												Not even close to the best butt-kicking game on Steam, much less on consoles, DMC4 continues from the paradigm set in DMC3 where the enemies are glorified punching bags for Dante's combat. There are a lot of twitch tricks you can use to take Dante for a ride (And less so Nero, who is frightfully boring and whose only gimmick is just throwing timed button presses into his combo as an ersatz action selection.) and pummel the array of hapless idiots who pose no threat to you, and the game only holds value as long as you enjoy exploring Dante's combo system as it cannot challenge or interest you otherwise.Don't play it ""properly."" The campaign is dreadful. Your moveset is locked away such that you will need almost two full playthroughs to unlock every move for each character. The backtracking would not be so bad if the levels were so boring the FIRST time, broken up with so many empty rooms and dumb physics puzzles and platforming. Just grab a debug cheat, unlock everything and pick and choose which levels you want to play. Skip through Bloody Palace as it's too boring and long to play straight through.

												...it's not great.  The first three devil may cry games set a real standard, but this one is a massive letdown, carboard characters and the like.  Combat sucks a rusty busket of nails, the dodge move is a pile of junk, the pc optimization might as well not exist, since there's no bloody mouse controls!  The new dmc is like twenty six million times better, get it.  Worth it, man.*Edit* How can people actually defend this?  It's like defending attack of the clones for god sakes!*Edit 2* 6 downvotes.  I just don't get it.  Will someone please explain to me, enlighten me for christ sakes, why would anyone in their right mind think of defending him?*Edit 3* After ten more downvotes, I take it back.  Don't try explaining it to me.  I won't listen.			",99,15,0,8,6,1,7

												The story is ok, and the scenarios are pretty cool, but the combat is terrible. The camera system doesn't work (you often cannot move to the direction you want because of the camera) and the AI either cheats a lot or there's something very wrong with their move animations/Nero's dodge. Worst DMC game in the franchise, imo. Not worth a single dollar.			",61,4,0,7,0,0,7

												Very good DMC. If you are itching for a DMC on the pc.... GET THIS ONE! At first it seems like a normal pc port that is meant t5o be play on a big screen with a gamepad with ur pc connected to it. WRONG! Thought that sentance is true this pc port has the BEST mode... ""LEGENDARY DARK KNIGHT"" this mode increases enemy amounts by AT LEAST 200%! Which, as ever true devil hunter knows, is GREAT fro getting SSS rankings. If no otherreason get this game for that one reason. BUYER BEWARE: This game does NOT have deafult mouse support, HOWEVER there is a guide that makes it simple to use the keyboard and mouse.

												This was my second Devil May Cry game I've played, for some reason I'm working backwards through the franchise. So, the story is fairly simple you start off playing as Nero, who I enjoyed playing more than I did Dante, but I enjoyed watching Dante's scenes more though, you find out the Order is evil and they eventually use the girl Nero loves as leverage to try to stop him from messing up their plot to essentially rule the world. Nero is a fun character to play because his arm gives him the ability to slam enemies and grab and pull them Scorpian style (Mortal Kombat). I didn't really use the ability his bike engine sword gives you where you can rev it up and make the next attack to powerful, I found the time to rev up the meter wasn't worth it. Dante on the other hand is fun to play since he has different stances to choose from (each stance has different attacks and combos), and he also gets a whole arsenal of weaponry, 3 ranged weapons and 3 melee weapons. This gives him more variety in combat and makes getting S ranks way easier. I really enjoyed the conversations between these two characters, Dante the funny, outgoing, laid back guy, Nero is more determined and out to prove himself yet a little disrespectful in a good way. The environment is beautiful, every piece of architecture is amazing and very detailed. The Bosses are pretty well done as well, every boss you fight starts off as a puzzle to figure how you're going to attack and then excuting it. But it also brings up what is bad about this game.I love this game but it does have some things that I could do without or could be improved on. First the Bosses, the first time you play them it fun and challenging, but they make you fight each one of them 3 times, 2 with Nero and 1 with Dante. I feel like they got lazy and decided just to throw the same bosses at you instead of new ones. Another thing that bothered me and sort of ruined the game for me alittle was the Boss fight with the huge statue and then the level after that. The fight with the statue was sort of weird, if he destoryed the platform you are on you float down then a cutscene which leads you to being a different platform magically. The whole fight took me out of the experience, but then the level after that is where they bring back the Dice game that you play on an earlier level. It would've been fine if you had to do it once or twice but it felt like a good 30 minutes of rolling the dice over and over again, this is also where you fight the Bosses for the third time. One last thing that bothered me was the camera, for the most part it wasn't bad but sometimes it would be your worst enemy, floating behind walls or having the worst angle for a fight.Overall I enjoyed the game and definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in Devil May Cry or any good action game. I've read bad things about this game like Capcom didn't put much effort into this game and its not really that good, I can see where they're coming from but to me it was a pretty good game. I also didn't mind playing as a new character and Dante sharing the spotlight, maybe because I haven't played the past games yet but I played and reviewed this from a unbiased point of view which I think other people should do the same.

												Devils Never Cry... so lock and load with the last classic DMC game, Devil May Cry 4. This game is easy to pick up but takes a lifetime to master. With different combinations of stylish moves, DMC4 offers many hours of gameplay with gut-wrenching difficulty levels. Think you can survive when one hit causes your death or when hoards of demons are unleashed upon you? Then Devil May Cry 4 is the game for you. Take your sword and gun and LET'S ROCK BABY!!!

												UPDATE:There is a Special Edition of the game available for purchase. It does not add too much to the PC version, however I reccomend picking that up if you have: A) Not played the game or B) Only played the 360 or PS3 versions of the game as there are a lot more modes and characters. If you have played the PC version, the only difference is the slight graphical upgrade and the new characters. Otherwise, there isn't that much of a difference between the two. It is not a MASSIVE upgrade compared to Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, however it is worth buying if you haven't already purchased the PC version of DMC4, which I would imagine you haven't if you are reading this review.________________________________________________________________The game is absolutely amazing. This is definitely a Devil May Cry game. If you enjoyed 1 and 3, you will like this one just as much. Even if you didn't enjoy the other DMC games, you should still give this a try, whether it be because of the games being too hard, the simple control scheme, the fixed camera or the backtracking, this game improves on all of those making it a good game to start with or play even if you didn't enjoy the classic DMC games. For those who haven't played a DMC game, they are hardcore action games notorious for their difficulty. You fight demons throughout the whole games and you also fight bosses and solve puzzles. The combat is very solid, responsive, satisfying and is also very challenging to master. However being able to master the games mechanics will cause some absolutely beautiful combos and moves that your character will do which will look awesome. The games are also known for playing heavy metal music during the fight scenes and also some fairly irritating backtracking, which thankfully, has been toned down a lot in this game. The PC port is okay. The game works fairly well with keyboard and mouse (despite lack of camera control with the mouse) but the game works better with a controller. Not just because the mouse control doesn't work, but because games from this genre are just better off being played with a controller. The PC version doesn't include any overintensive features so it is also very easy to run on any machine with a high frame rate. While not the best looking game in the world, it still has enough PC specific features. There is also a Directx 10 mode. However, at least for me, this seemed to make the game a bit more unstable causing it to crash more. There also didn't appear to be that much of a difference between DX9 and DX10 modes. The PC version also has a mode which was not included on the PS3 and 360 versions due to power restraints - Legendary dark knight mode which spawns way more enemies on screen. This makes the game a lot more frantic and enjoyable and could maybe also appeal to fans of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. (Update - This mode is also included in the Special Edition of the game and may also be included on the console versions of the Special Edition)The game fixes a lot of problems that the original games have and makes the combat a lot better. It is  a little slow paced and clunky at first and the game is by no means as brutally challenging as DMC1 and 3, but it is still good. Also, your first playthrough may take you some time as you do have a few annoying puzzle sections and a few moments where you may be unsure of where to go, however it is all easy to remember so your second playthrough will be a breeze (in terms of the travelling). However, the game still has it's problems. The level design is a bit weak. The second half of the game is just all of the levels you have played through in reverse with no puzzles included. You even replay the same bosses but in reverse order. Also, for 2/3rds of the game you don't play as Dante. You play as Dante for the second half of the game and only the second half unfortunately. You cannot go back to previous levels and play as Dante which is dissapointing. However it does make the game much more enjoyable when Dante is finally playable. That may sound annoying for die-hard fans of DMC, however Nero, Dante's replacement is still fun to use, even though he feels a little slow and basic at first. Even though the level design is a little weak, that does not by any means the game is not fun to replay. It is just as fun to replay as the 3rd game. As for difficulty, easy mode is like Devil May Cry 2, however Dante must die (very hard) mode is comparable to Devil May Cry 3 on harder difficulties which, in my opinion, is spot on how they should have done the difficulty. I like this because experts get their challenge, however the game is also noob friendly. This DMC game is a good one to start with, actually as it is not so forgiving. The combat isn't amazing at first, but once you start unlocking upgrades and slowly get better, the combat begins to get amazing. Overall, DMC4 is a brilliant and worthwhile entry to the series. Despite not playing as Dante, the core is still DMC. Some could argue the combat is not as good as DMC3, however in some ways 4 is more enjoyable as it is not so brutally hard. It also does not include as much backtracking or mapless wandering around like in 3. Even if you didn't like DMC 1 or 3, you should still give this one a whirl as it might be more your thing in terms of difficulty, mechanics and level design. If you are a hardcore DMC fan, you should also give this a go, but don't expect it to be too much better than the original games.			",146,8,3,9,22,3,18

I first played it on my NVidia shield which lead me to actually paying for the game on steam, so even if i have played it for 1.5 hours i actually played it for the same ammount of time on the Shield.Review: After seeing the trailer for the latest DmC, I was quite stunned at first and I wanted it so bad it was insane.but then a few years later I saw DMC4 on the list of GRID games for the NVidia shield and I just had to try it out for myself, proceeding to do so i found myself falling head over heels for the DMC franchise. The sound track, the style of the game, the fighting, and the story was just unbelievable to me. And I usually don't play games by Capcom unless they are the fighting games such as Street Fighter, but I'm glad I actually went out of my way and gave this game a chance to impress me and it did more then I expected it to			",123,10,1,21,6,2,6

Allows you to build a character;+ inspired settings, even if exploration can be boring;+ learn well, play well: the game awards you for being fast, perceptive and cunning.Cons:- additional challenges are... too much challenging: a sub-average player can't win;- some weapons' DPS is ridicolously higher than others' - I don't feel free to choose if the alternatives are ""average"" and ""powerful"";- if you're too powerful, battles will end before the ""S+"" ratings are unlocked: you are undergraded because you're too ""good"".All in all, a must have for combo-breakers or ""relaxing"" pure gameplay.

												So, for people that haven't play this game which I personally imagine there is not a huge gamer without passing through this serie.Devil May Cry 4 Is and will be one of the best part of the franchise in which they gave new characters, new story and a whole new teories related to Nero, but for this game if you really are a huge fan of the franchise is highly recommended but for new fans or new people this game have one of the most horrible bases when changing character to Dante on chapter 12 you can see how the people is absurd on the programmation cause you see the exact same level and to put it rough the exact same bosses with a little increase of difficult, its just horrible how Capcom made that mistake caus who doesn't like when dante has an enormous amount of weapons and how they made it to create more combos, this game doesn't support the greatest re-play cause the only characters or costumes you can actually unlock is the Super version of this characters so for new people i recommend passing throught the entire franchise and come to see this game and how well they executed this game but as the same way how they dropp it down with dante part of the game			",96,4,0,5,1,1,4

												Pros - Great combat system, Dante is the same and Nero has an interesting system. Dante isn't an emo eitherCons - back tracking (granted, i'd have played the game through as Dante regardless) to a huge degree,  camera is poor at besti'd recommend it on sale, picking it up with DMC 3 in the bundle especially. Its a great game, if only more time went into new levels rather than just making Dante do all of Neros levels backwards i really would be so much happier with this. Pulling off awesome combos is very satisfying though			",247,36,1,44,51,0,87

												Really fun game. This is the first DMC game I've played. Same old hack and slash game mechanics. Room full of mobs, take 'em out. A few puzzles here and there. Lots of hidden items throughout levels. Fighting mechanics are good, it is plesant to go through the combos. The graphics of the game are absolutely breath taking... if you have a rig good enough to max out the graphics settings. Game play is comparable to that of God of War games. And although I haven't finished the game, the story is compelling so far.			",49,3,1,3,0,0,1

												Probably one of the better hack and slash games out there. Definately worth the price. The music is generally good, the fighting music doesn't get old that fast (which I thought it would) and despite hearing it dozens of times throughout a level I kind of like it. Hell even the music in the menus is good. 9/10 (could be more variety but still awesome).The graphics are good as well, I noticed nothing in particular that was that bad. 10/10The gameplay is pretty solid, you have guns that do nothing in terms of damage but at least you have something to do while the enemy is trying to get at you from a distance to shut them down. The sword combos feel a little clunky sometimes and dont always register the move i pushed in which is a little annoying but nothing gamebreaking. Some enemies have cool extra animations when you kill them a certain way too. The problem with this game? The Camera and sometimes the targeting system. The camera is awful througout most of this game as it locks your view sometimes and makes some attacks come out of nowhere, this is really something that almost broke the game for me the first 30 minutes or so and only my love for the combat made me push on. The targeting is derived somewhat from the Z-targeting of the Zelda series which is an argument in itself, not a fan personally but hey, if you liked the combat in Zelda, you are going to love this game. 4/10 with the camera, it's awful but the game carries it.  The story is really wierd and good. Most characters aren't acting human, just badass. This annoyed me to some extent but since this game is really over the top in all cases it kind of grew on me. It's so bad it's good. I laughed on multiple occasions at the quirky dialogue and the illogical statements of many of the characters. Dante is hands down the best character because he simply doesn't give a f*ck and just enjoys the show. The boss killings with Dante are ten times better too, just play the game and you'll know what I mean. 10/10, it doesn't get any more tacky and cool than this. Although it should be said that this is probably one of the most gender insensitive games I have played, all the girls that actually do anything (that would be like one of them) dress like hookers. Neros girlfriend did eventually talk without screaming ""Nero"" and thats a step forward I guess. Not that this doesn't fit the title with its tacky characters (especially Dante) it just doesn't sit right with me that all women need to spot cleavage in a game this awesome. So like 4/10 on gender eq in this game.To summerize it is a really good game despite the bad camera and the wierd characters. It's a game full of badasses that a teenager would look up to as cool guys and any person over 20 can have a good laugh at because of the over the top style. 8/10 as a whole, the game is awesome but has some flaws.

												this game its a must have for the hack and slash gendre, really good really polish and in the latest dificultys, very challenging, the bad thing i realize was bad during the playtrougth was the length of the game 4-6 hours and a very very markes re-use of levels... there is 4 boses that you are going to figth multiple times during the walkthrough so it gets repetetive after a while, in dante must die is where they really pump up the dificulty but its notable the reuse of the enemies.the bosses are well designed but until dante must die dificulty they do more attacs and attack more often.if you can master the game (whitch im not) you can see that this game its more simpler and simpler the more you play and thus, more easy...i recomend this game for its great pc port and replayability (bloody palace) but just bear in mind the length and the repetitive bosses/enemiesi would say that his game for pick up one in a while and try to defeat the bloody palace as ultimate goal, as the campain becomes its more to unlock thingks as of playing ",166,23,8,19,14,0,18

												You play this stupidly hot guy with his stupidly perfect skin and hi stupid silky smooth white hair and ♥♥♥♥ hella♥♥♥♥♥♥up. 10/10Now dank memes are all nice and well but let's get serious, or rather as serious as one can be while the topic is Devil may Cry 4.I will start off with my greatest and maybe only concern and those are the games controls because with all due respect, what the actual ♥♥♥♥. Now in theory you can play this game with Kb, but in theory communism is a good idea. It does not use the mouse. Let that sink in for a moment. Who thought that this was a good idea? I see no reason whatsoever why gun attack and sword attack should'nt be mouse 1 and 2. Now the keybinds which are by default rather questionable (For example jump being on  k feels counterintiutive eventhough it does make some sense since it is kinda important to press spacebar (target enemy) together with other buttons for combos) are rebindable but still there is no way of incorporating the mouse. Controller is a definitely the way to go here, but for shame making an rpg properly playable on a Pc is not nuclear physics.But screw it lets get to the good stuff. On my build Intel g3258 r9 280 8gigs ram DMC4 runs at around 200 fps, and while its graphics are not impressive by that means they are pleasing mostly due to their timeless character.Actual gameplay and story boys. Its cheesy as ♥♥♥♥. And really that's not a bad thing. Everything in this game is over the top from combat to quotes. Some of the stuff( who am i kidding a lot of stuff) that will happen throughout the game is falt out reatrded. But it doesn't come of as cringy because we just roll with it. If everything is ridicilous, nothing is. You are pretty much running around throwing demons at other demons with your demonhand yelling ""slamdunk"" between al of that. It is hard to describe my sentiments regarding this, but flat out it comes over as awesome. The storyline will probably not present with a lot of upsets but I find the plethora of cutscenes rather enjoyable to watch.The combat is really satisfying albeit your sword feels somewhat blunt at times in comparison to say all the cutting you can do in metal gear rising revengeance, nonetheless you have a lot of options on how to engage your enemies be they normal mobs or bosses. Beating stuff up just makes you feel like one BAMF. Now most of the levels are in the end solved by walking forwards and chosing the next door, but yet they do not feal linear. Again my reasoning behind this sentiment is not that easy to explain but it just has to do with the way the world is laid out. You do not find the way, the way finds you.LETS ROCK			",46,4,0,4,3,0,4

												You play as a seemingly rebellious young male that goes by the name of Nero. While those who have played past DMC games may be thrown off by this (if this is the first time playing or seeing DMC4), that confusion may or may soon be thrown away as a rather devious looking Dante, and the bullet that finds its way into a preachers' skull, ignites the story that is to follow.It's.... hard to describe my opinion about this game. I am a fan of the prior DMC game-.... well, maybe not DMC2.... but a fan none the less. Yet, I am also a fan of this game. A game that many seem to consider to be just too different from the prior DMC games, or at the very least, not as good. But what many seem to not realize is that while this is indeed a rather parcular turn for the DMC4 series, it both raises and answers major plot holes in prior games to the franchise. Such as, what happened to Virgil?........I think that's it. But answers none the less!If I were to consider this game worth playing, yes, yes I would. Why? I am a stickler for people who think that being a fan of something, means to shun anything that isn't the same thing, or is what they believe to be a faker of what they are a fan of. I like this game for what it is. A hack and slash game that forces you to rack up combo meters in order to get the most out of both your experience, and the progression needed to complete this game to its fullest. Old characters feel familiar, new characters feel unique, and the story brings back a complexity that I am glad did not end with DMC3.If you are a DMC fan, I recommend this game. If you are new to the DMC series, I actually recommend this game first. While still consider 1 and 3 the better games, 4 is the most player friendly, and will properly introduce you to the game's elements and mechanics.			",191,17,2,38,7,2,6

												Devil May Cry 4 is fantastic!  I have no complaints for the PC version of this game.  It is more or less the same Devil May Cry your used to if you are familiar with the Devil May Cry Series.  However, DMC 4 has some added features.  First of all you get to play as Nero.  Nero has a demon hand that allows him to grab enemies from a distance and deal massive damage.  All character movements are fluid, and you get to play as Dante towards the end of the game.  Increased difficulty based on how you want to play and customization skills.  I approve this game.  Had a lot of fun slaughtering demons!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great action game, easily the best game in the DMC series, except for maybe DMC3 ultimate super edition (whichever one came after where they fixed the awful) or the first one. Has a great cast full of memorable laughs and badass moments, not to mention has a soundtrack that consists of some actually pretty good music (boss tracks mostly.) Definitely recomemend to everyone to check out Nero's super nice snatch.Overall Rating: 10/10			",126,35,3,20,9,1,19

												Probably one of the better hack and slash games out there. Definately worth the price. The music is generally good, the fighting music doesn't get old that fast (which I thought it would) and despite hearing it dozens of times throughout a level I kind of like it. Hell even the music in the menus is good. 9/10 (could be more variety but still awesome).The graphics are good as well, I noticed nothing in particular that was that bad. 10/10The gameplay is pretty solid, you have guns that do nothing in terms of damage but at least you have something to do while the enemy is trying to get at you from a distance to shut them down. The sword combos feel a little clunky sometimes and dont always register the move i pushed in which is a little annoying but nothing gamebreaking. Some enemies have cool extra animations when you kill them a certain way too. The problem with this game? The Camera and sometimes the targeting system. The camera is awful througout most of this game as it locks your view sometimes and makes some attacks come out of nowhere, this is really something that almost broke the game for me the first 30 minutes or so and only my love for the combat made me push on. The targeting is derived somewhat from the Z-targeting of the Zelda series which is an argument in itself, not a fan personally but hey, if you liked the combat in Zelda, you are going to love this game. 4/10 with the camera, it's awful but the game carries it.  The story is really wierd and good. Most characters aren't acting human, just badass. This annoyed me to some extent but since this game is really over the top in all cases it kind of grew on me. It's so bad it's good. I laughed on multiple occasions at the quirky dialogue and the illogical statements of many of the characters. Dante is hands down the best character because he simply doesn't give a f*ck and just enjoys the show. The boss killings with Dante are ten times better too, just play the game and you'll know what I mean. 10/10, it doesn't get any more tacky and cool than this. Although it should be said that this is probably one of the most gender insensitive games I have played, all the girls that actually do anything (that would be like one of them) dress like hookers. Neros girlfriend did eventually talk without screaming ""Nero"" and thats a step forward I guess. Not that this doesn't fit the title with its tacky characters (especially Dante) it just doesn't sit right with me that all women need to spot cleavage in a game this awesome. So like 4/10 on gender eq in this game.To summerize it is a really good game despite the bad camera and the wierd characters. It's a game full of badasses that a teenager would look up to as cool guys and any person over 20 can have a good laugh at because of the over the top style. 8/10 as a whole, the game is awesome but has some flaws.

												Really fun game. This is the first DMC game I've played. Same old hack and slash game mechanics. Room full of mobs, take 'em out. A few puzzles here and there. Lots of hidden items throughout levels. Fighting mechanics are good, it is plesant to go through the combos. The graphics of the game are absolutely breath taking... if you have a rig good enough to max out the graphics settings. Game play is comparable to that of God of War games. And although I haven't finished the game, the story is compelling so far.			",49,3,1,3,0,0,1

												Pros - Great combat system, Dante is the same and Nero has an interesting system. Dante isn't an emo eitherCons - back tracking (granted, i'd have played the game through as Dante regardless) to a huge degree,  camera is poor at besti'd recommend it on sale, picking it up with DMC 3 in the bundle especially. Its a great game, if only more time went into new levels rather than just making Dante do all of Neros levels backwards i really would be so much happier with this. Pulling off awesome combos is very satisfying though			",247,36,1,44,51,0,87

												Time to get cuh-razy! (oh wait, wrong entry)Devil May Cry 4 features a storyline where you play as Nero, and (slight spolier) eventually Dante from the previous entries. The gameplay with Nero is a bit repetitve, as his combat is a bit simple unless you want to use a few odd mechanics, like where you charge up the motor on his sword. I forget what that was called. Nonetheless, there really isn't a reason to use a lot of the mechanics for nero becuase you'll be grabbing and slashing for most of the game. Even so, the combat and gameplay is exceptionally fun. The boss fights are definetely the epitome of the game, the boss rush was a joy to play.The PC port of Devil May Cry 4 is top-notch with plenty of settings to choose from, I'm sure you could get this game to run on a toaster. The animations are top-notch and the game plays as smooth as butter on PC, and the game looks gorgeous for the most part. The game is also packed to the brim with content, and has plenty of replayability with all it's difficulty modes and the bloody palace (survival mode.)Overall, it's not a perfect game, but if you enjoy the franchise or a good action game, I would recommend Devil May Cry 4.

												Devil May Cry 4 is fantastic!  I have no complaints for the PC version of this game.  It is more or less the same Devil May Cry your used to if you are familiar with the Devil May Cry Series.  However, DMC 4 has some added features.  First of all you get to play as Nero.  Nero has a demon hand that allows him to grab enemies from a distance and deal massive damage.  All character movements are fluid, and you get to play as Dante towards the end of the game.  Increased difficulty based on how you want to play and customization skills.  I approve this game.  Had a lot of fun slaughtering demons!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although unfinished, Devil May Cry 4 has to be my favorite of the series, the third installment being my second favorite. I love Nero, and contrary to popular belief, no, that is not why that is my name. Devil May Cry 4 offers stunning combat, and although after a while, Nero seems to become bland, he is still a well developed character. He brings to the table solid combos, great voice acting, a loveable personality similar to the known and loved, Dante. The PC port is lots of fun as well, featuring a PC exclusive mode, Legendary Dark Knight, with rediculous waves of enemies. Ever wanted to fight a ton of Bianco Angelos? No? How about two Blitz's? A few Fausts? No? Well don't play this mode, because it is extremely rage inducing. Unless, you are of course, good at the game. As for Dante, well, I could go on for hours about his near impossible to learn array techniques and mind blowing combos, but it would be easier for you to just look some stuff up on YouTube. Trust me, you won't regret it. Do I recommend it? F$#* yes. Buy it, feg. :v			",14,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Forget people who complain about controls, especially after DMC3 on here. DMC4 is perfect on PC, it runs on a potato with ease, and with an amazing computer, it looks even better! I can't complain on PC keyboard controls, because it's much more playable, and the controller support is fantastic! Nero is nice to play as, especially for anyone new to DMC, but once you get to Dante, it's just perfect, as his on the fly battle style and multiple weapons work perfectly together. all in all, grab this game. 20 bucks isn't bad at all!

												TL; DR: Good game with really fun gameplay and mostly tight controls but that can be a little frustrating at times. Over-the-top fun characters, story and cutscenes. Disappointing lack of additional playable characters.Finally got around to beating this game and I have to say, I'm sorry it took me so long (due to technical bugs corrupting my game saves and such). The gameplay is as strong as it's been in the long-standing franchise, better actually as you get to play as new hero Nero as well as Dante later on in the game. They both play very differently but offer equally compelling modes of fun and over-the-top signature DMC aerial & ground combos mixed with guns but I was partial to Dante's gameplay as I found his ground combos, 4 styles and additional weaponry to offer a lot more versatility and enjoyment. In fact, Dante sports some of the most creative and badass weapons that I've had to joy to play with and for them alone the game is worth getting.But I digress, aside from the incredibly fun, tight and varied combat the game takes you through cool-looking environments typical of the series that are are both grand in scale and that offer neat platforming elements and hidden collectibles/missions that round up the game nicely.However, as it also typical of the franchise there is a fair amount of backtracking as you need to go back and unlock certain areas once you gain the appropriate new ability (which is fine) but this is further compounded by the fact that you revisit the same exact areas when you later play as Dante. I find this to be shame and a sign of the development team cutting corners and saving time & money, but it ultimately cheapens the quality of the game. What's more is that you fight the exact same 3 bosses as Dante that you did as Nero which just feels like a let-down and a missed opportunity to have turned a really good game into a fantastic one.Next, the story. There isn't anything really original about it as it's your standard corrupt organization-turned-zealots-who-try-to-remake-the-world-in-their-image-and-the-hero(s)-have-to-stop-them fare. Despite this I really enjoyed it thanks to the playful & devil-may-care (lawl, see wut I did there? :P) attitudes of both main characters although it's a lot more pronounced and entertaining in Dante's case than it is with Nero. The story is also filled with over-the-top HILARIOUS cutscenes such as a back & forth theatrical soliloquy between Dante and one of the game's bosses that is one of the funniest moments that I've experienced in a game :). Coupled with this are lots of extremely stylish and badass sequences that really help to further set the tone for the game and give you an appreciation for how powerful these characters really are.As for the shortcomings of the game I found the use of fixed camera angles in many locations to be rather frustrating as it's easy to have your character come to a sudden stop or start running in the opposite direction when you enter a new area where the camera angle is different from the previous one. I also felt that 2 of the more difficult moves (for Nero) were overly complicated to perform as they require incredible reflexes and timing which I and I'm sure many other gamers just don't have and so I never really used them. This is in contrast to similiar combo-heavy games like God of War, Bayonetta and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow that have as complicated a move and ability set but where all the controls are accessible and aren't an exercise in frustration.It's also rather unfortunate that despite being able to unlock 2 additional harder modes (and 2 even tougher after that, h.o.l.y.c.r.a.p.!) after having beaten the game there is no further option to play as Trish/Gloria or Lady which is another missed opportunity, Team Ninja :(. I say this because you could unlock Trish and Vergil as playable characters in DMC 2 & 3, respectively.           Furthermore I find it disappointing that the devleopper resorted to over-sexualizing their female characters in order to help sell the game, giving them unrealistic exagerrated curves and bounciness that they didn't possess in previous games in the series. I'm all for sexy models but only when they make sense and aren't objectifying.Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the game's intrinsic difficulty: the game is HARD (especially on the 2nd default difficulty available at the start) and will kick your♥♥♥♥♥♥and challenge you to play better, which I loved. But if you're the type of person who shies away from demanding games that test your reflexes and coordination then you may want to try the easier setting yet still expect to struggle.8.25/10			",142,33,0,14,1,0,2

												Devil May Cry 4 is one of the most polished and well done hack-and-slash games around. It's also one of my favourites. In the game you play the role of Nero and Dante, the two demonhunters. Basically you fight your way through demon-invaded zones while an epic tale of love and treason is being told. The music, the graphic, the personalities of the characters, the fight system - everything is awesome separately too, but together they make DMC4 one of the best games ever made. For the best experience I'd recommend to use an Xbox360 Controller for Windows. The game absolutely worth its price and is a must.			",238,42,3,21,5,0,9

												So I'm at the end with Nero now, it's entertaining and keeps things rather interesting combat-wise, but it's not without it's problems. If you enjoy fast-paced hack and slash I'd recommend it, though it's not too fast by default. I'm about to drop some hate on it, but by all means play it, I hate it but love it just enough to keep playing. 6/10Be Aware That:- Enemies can fall through the map, with some luck and gunfire you may lure them back, if not you have to restart.- If you want a challenge this game isn't for you. Every time you lose (to a boss for sure) they'll be handicapped unless you restart the whole level. This is not optional, and is rather insulting. So don't die if you like to brag about beating it on the hardest difficulty, otherwise you'll be bragging that you lost until you ultimately won from all the losing.- DX10 mode will cause crashes durring cutscenes, sometimes before you even realize that one is taking place, causing you to restart.- The camera is your greatest enemy. Forward will become backward and then forward and then backward before you know what's going on. Combt controls also change based on the camera position.- Dante's AI is extremely lame, borderline godly due to faster animations, and also possesses invulnerability frames/animations that will prevent him from being damaged as he slowly does whatever he pleases. (I've yet to test this but I'm pretty sure all the awesomeness of this isn't available when you play as him, so enjoy that.)- Inventory breaks the 4th-Wall and saves items used before your death; stupid on so many levels.- Side Missions break from the story in a terrible way and aren't really disreable in my opinion.One Awesome Thing You May Not Know About:+ You may roam between levels and farm/get lost, pretty sweet.
