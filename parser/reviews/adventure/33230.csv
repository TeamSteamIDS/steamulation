Introduction:We have all heard the phrase that “nothing beats the original” at least once in our lives. Assassin’s Creed II is a living testimony against these wise words. It is the much-improved sequel to its 2007 predecessor published by Ubisoft, and the first of a new trilogy of games (II, Brotherhood, and Revelations). While the first game in the franchise had a huge amount of potential, it fell a little bit short in the eyes of many. However, Assassin’s Creed II earned an almost unanimous critical acclaim - and with a good reason. Like the original installment, ACII remains an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. Setting it apart, however, is its new approach to less repetitive gameplay combined with solid story development… And yes, it does take the time to fill the majority of the plot holes left open from its forerunner.As a general warning, you should not read this section if you have not yet cleared the first game, and have the intention of doing so. There are minor spoilers ahead, for those of you who have not cleared the first installment of Assassin’s Creed.Story: This game picks up precisely where the first left off. Abstergo. Desmond remains a prisoner of the modern-day Templars, as he begins to comprehend the significance of his genetic memories - and the danger of the Apple of Eden falling into the wrong hands. Before he has too much time to brood, the game kicks off with a fast pace, springing Desmond from Abstergo, and introducing him to the modern-day Assassins. With their help, and their version of the Animus, Desmond submits himself to relive the experiences of another ancestor in hopes of becoming an assassin for their own cause. This time he finds himself in 15th-century Italy, at the height of the Renaissance, following the life of another ancestor called Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezio is a noble who finds himself betrayed by the cities rulers, and sets out on a quest for vengeance. Gameplay: There is a lot to be said about the mechanics and gameplay elements that Assassin’s Creed II introduced. Too often, a sequel is just a repeat of the first game, with a different storyline. This is not the case here. Ubisoft did an excellent job immersing the player in what is now a believable world, retaining some of its original mechanics. The beautifully designed free-running system from it’s forerunner has returned, only this time it permits the player to move faster: Thus, cover more ground in less time, and make exploration much more satisfying. As additional encouragement to explore the region, they have hidden treasure chests in every location - Low on coin? No problem! Either go find these hidden goodies, or just kill a guard and pick his pockets.I’d also like to take a moment to pay homage to the improved battle system. The combat aesthetics are absolutely stunning, making almost any fight appear brutal and bloody. Furthermore, you now have numerous weapons to pick from at the blacksmith shops, each offering its own selection of kill animations. The quests also have a more modernized efficiency to them, and appear on the map as exclamation marks to guide the player to the next objective. As I have previously stated, they are also a lot less repetitive. You no longer follow the same formula in each quest, which is hugely refreshing. Should Ezio run into trouble during any of these missions, he can opt to blend in just about any crowd of people, or purchase assistance from his allied factions: thieves, courtesans, and mercenaries. Just be careful not to draw too much unwanted attention, or you’ll have to go tear down wanted posters to reduce your notoriety. The purchasing system is really enjoyable. You can change the color of your robes, buy upgrades, weapons, armor, health potions, and even artwork. Once you reach the village of Monteriggioni, you can begin the process of renovating the city to generate your own income through your investments.Finally, keep an eye open for glyphs by using eagle vision. You won’t want to miss out on the story that their puzzles will reveal.Controls: The controls are relatively friendly, but no longer offer support with re-arranging your buttons. A controller is still the best way to get around, in my opinion, although you cannot re-assign your button placement at will this time. I still do not recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse, but if that suits you, by all means do so.Targeting remains a bit tricky, and you can’t always be sure that you will hit what you’re aiming for, but it is something you can work around. From time to time, you might find yourself changing your viewpoint and inadvertently targeting something else, oops!Graphics: Assassin’s Creed has been known to focus a lot of attention on their atmosphere, so it is only fitting that the graphics are as polished as they are. This game offers beautiful and breathtaking sights, and paints them in a realistic light. It is really hard to criticize this aspect of the game, because they did such an amazing job with fine-tuning the scenery to fit their setting. I absolutely love how the game looks and feels, and I’m pretty sure you will too.Sound: The music is beautiful, and the voice tracks are considerably less annoying than its predecessor. The combination of assassinating a target to the score of dramatic music can only be described as a rewarding experience. Though it should be noted that the entirely optional use of subtitles will help with translating the incorporated use of the Italian language. Overall the sounds contribute immensely to the games atmosphere, which is something that I will likely continuously praise in this particular franchise.Replay Value: Assassin’s Creed II is among my favourites in the series, thus far, and I would definitely recommend a replay at some point. Then again, replay value is entirely dependent on the person playing the game.			",83,20,0,36,0,0,0

 Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.  Plot  – If you haven’t  played the previous game yet, like I did, you’ll probably be confused on what is happening during the first part of this game. But even so, the writers did a great job of giving out stories about the happenings during the previous game, giving you at least an explanation on what is going on.  Similar to first one, you will still play as Desmond Miles. But instead of tracing back to Altair, you will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance period. You will discover your father’s secret and join the Assassin Order to help them end their feud against the Templars and finally achieve true peace.The game is long enough for you to be satisfied, as I’ve poured more than 20 hours to finish the story. Even though it may sound generic to some, but I assure you that this will leave you pleased as this is one of the greatest stories told in the franchise. Environment and Design  –  It is exactly how the Renaissance was pictured in the paintings we can see on museums. The game also boasts the popular and fictional landmarks that are found in different parts of the map. Other than the resemblance, most of them were also a big part of the main story. And this is a great way for players to learn about these historical places.The cities have the golden yellow effect, though it is probably just the sun, giving it the nostalgic effect. With five different maps that you can go to, you’ll have a huge sandbox to roam and play on. Thus, they’ve included fast travel stations for you to switch into different maps trouble-free. And this will come handy as you progress towards the game when you start jumping into different maps or going back and forth to your own villa. In this, you can manage the infrastructures to be built and a chance to increase your income.  Gameplay  – Even though the game is about being on stealth to pick off unguarded enemies, parkouring from different rooftops to get to your objective, it also offer an impressive close combat fights. Even though there are times that the game doesn’t give you choices on how you want to assassinate a target, it is still satisfying task to do. If ever you’re in help, there are three different factions that you can rely on. Obstacle course or puzzles can also be found in-game, even though they aren’t that easy they are also not that too hard. But in fact, during the start of each puzzle, the camera will give you an idea on how to complete the course. For a game during its time, these features are awesome and very satisfying. Controls  - I had trouble playing the game for the first time, I even had some trouble towards the end. First, the buttons shown in HUD aren't clear. I had to check the controls in the options just to see what keys to press to do a specific action. I didn't know how to sprint not until I finished the first fight of Ezio. And I'm a little impatient person, and the game punishes you for that. Specially during free running, I tend to hold down the Spacebar, even if I don't really have to, resulting for me to fall down. Conclusion  - If you haven't tried any Assassin's Creed game before, just like me, I recommend that you either start with this or the first game. Whichever, you can assure that you will have a great time on finishing them. And for me, this is one of the best story this franchise has. Since this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.Thank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood - ReviewAssassin's Creed: Revelations - Review ",763,245,29,80,57,10,64

												I'll start out by saying that this game is an improvement in every way over Assassin's Creed. The main improvement is it's NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.Your hero in Assasin's Creed 2 is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Ezio's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the bits outside the Animus) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note (you can even switch to playing the game in Italian with english subtitles!).The gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are VERY fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.Also, it easily has one of the best soundtrack! The music is not only original and cool, it changes perfectly to match the action in the game (chase scenes, flying, hiding etc). The developers really went out of their way with this one.This remains one of my favorite series of all time and I highly recommend it to all gamers. You might even learn a little italian too. xD

												In short: the best game i've played up to now; basta! This is a real love baby from Ubisoft: you can see and feel all the effort that is put into designing en developing the story and gameplay.Not only lots of action, but also very educational too. The story evolves in Renaissance Italy and is based on real cities, buildings, persons and historical events. All important buldings and persons are in the database of the game with all details about architecture and what a person achieved or did. Very interesting and very, very well done.Lately i was watching the Giro d'Italia and the buildings/roofings/cathedrals were exactly like in ACII!There's tons of side missions, an open world, beautiful graphics, great voice acting, great drama and violant fights. This game can be placed in several categories, not only action. You ride horses, fly in Leonardo da Vinci's plain, sail boats etc.This game is for me a 9 out of 10: too bad there are some bugs towards the end that affect gameplay.Still this game is a must have; it's brilliant. Go get it.This is an addendum 2 years later. I've played several new games the last 2 years, but still ACII is one of the best i've ever played.			",522,83,43,56,72,1,110

												Ubisoft Montreal left plenty of room to build upon the core concept established in Assassin’s Creed, developing their burgeoning modern day story of Desmond, a test subject who is made to regress back in time to former lives through the Animus. Assassin’s Creed II begins where the last game left off, with Desmond still confined to the Abstergo laboratories, staring at a wall of indecipherable code.After a hasty escape from Abstergo with Lucy in tow, it’s not long before you’re willingly lying back on an upgraded Animus, ready to delve into the life and times of yet another assassin. The assassin in question is Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman living in Renaissance Italy amid great political turmoil, brutal violence and emerging transcendent art.Unfolding over thirty years, Ezio’s story is far greater in scope, seeing the young petulant noble suffer through family tragedy, taking him on an epic quest for vengeance as he adopts his father’s mantle of master assassin. While the transformation from immature teen to super assassin seems awfully quick and more than a little unconvincing, there’s no disputing how much more fluid and satisfying to control Ezio is when compared to his medieval predecessor, Altair. Your protagonist isn’t the only aspect of Assassin’s Creed II to be expanded since the previous game though – every single facet of the game has been enhanced to an astonishing degree, far exceeding our expectations by a considerable margin. Not only have the fundamental mechanics been refined, making ACII a more pleasurable experience than the first game, but the sheer depth, breadth and variety of activities on offer is utterly staggering.Renaissance Italy itself is a glory to behold – a stark contrast to AC1’s cold grey and blue alleyways – Assassin’s Creed II’s regions are liberally draped in a startling palette of warm, sun-kissed hues all rendered in intricate detail.ACII’s Italy is not only home to Ezio’s story-led missions, but a host of other distractions, like courier deliveries, races, viewpoints and non-story related assassination contracts. Item collection still features heavily, but is nothing like the 400 or so flags you had to gather in the first game.Still the crux of the game remains in the assassinations and with the array of weapons and new combat opportunities available to you, the number of methods you can utilise to dispatch your targets is massively increased. Abilities such as aerial assassinations, ledge kills, poison blades and more give you a greater variety of options, some of which are unashamedly cool.Assassin’s Creed II is something altogether unique in its uninhibited size and wealth of ambition, few games managing to measure up in terms of depth and detail. Boasting a suitably grand soundtrack, majestic aesthetics and masterful level design, Assassin’s Creed II is everything you could have ever wished for and so much more. Overall 9/10.

												The first thing that should be said is Assassins Creed 2 is a major upgrade over the original game, the game actually plays a lot more like a Sandbox game than the original.   A whole bunch of new tricks have been added to help you live our your fantasies of being an assassin.  Some sorely needed tricks missing from the original game was the double execution, and the double jump while climbing.  Also the you can loot fallen enemies for money and an occasional refilling of your consumables.  You can now buy upgrades to your armor, which improve your fighting ability.  Another new addition to the game is new weapons, no longer stuck using predetermined weapons assigned by how far in the game you've gotten.  If you want to use a mace... have at it.. want to use a sword... you're golden pony boy..  Feeling like a two hander..  find your locale guard and slay him..  You can now roll around like the executioner.  Chopping and Slopping all over town..The story..  You return as Desmond Miles, a man captured by Abstergo Industries and forced to relive the memories of his ancestors.  Easy enough...  except the fact Abstergo plans to use Desmond until he's no longer viable..  (ok that's totally not cool)..  All is not lost as the first mission in the game sees Demond escape the clutches of Abstergo with the help of the sexy and talented Lucy.  He escapes from the comfortable confines of Abstergo industries to the truck of a car...   Meeting with a group of assassins who want Desmond to go back into the Animus so they can stop Abstergo.. (Wait I thought he was rescued so he didn't have to go back into the Animus... umm alrighty then)  This time around you step into the shoes of Enzio Auditore, a playboy, slacker, layabout... Although he's the son of a wealthy banker in the 1500's so what else would you expect from him.   After a major betrayal (I won't spoil it) he goes off to do what anyone would do when they are betrayed, get revenge by killing anyone involved.    The rest of the story is your typical, kill this person, rescue this person, kiss that person, while along the way building up your Uncles home town.  As a side note I personally found the Enzio story to be far more interesting than the one presented in the original game for Altaire. Gameplay..  The game play moves away from the repetitive nature of the first game.  Where the first game required you to fulfill 3 our of 6 events to unlock an assassination, this game abandoned that in favor of a more or less story driven progression system.  Now you do story missions to push forward the game.  Plenty of stuff aside from story missions exist, such as Assassination contract, races, fighting events.  Aside from those events the game also has collectibles, gone are the flags and  in their place you have Feathers, View Points, Weapons and Armors.  New execution and climbing animations have been added...  No more killing enemies one at a time with the double execution..   You also have an upgrade-able base, and the inclusion of money, which has some effects early on in the game, but about the mid way point you'll have far more money then you could ever spend, so don't fret too much if you're only pushing a few thousand after a few hours...  Once you get your city upgraded a decent bit you'll start pulling in money hand over foot.Combat..  Numerous changes to combat made AC 2 seem like a totally different game.  Double executions, no more regenerating health bars (you'll need medicine to heal yourself this time around), the AI has improved slightly, no more sitting and waiting to counter attack, this time around you can button mash provided you have decent enough reflexes to counter attack enemies.  A few new tools added to the arsenal as well..   You now find yourself with a (very limited) pistol, and what good assassin would be caught dead without a smoke ball (perfect for killing high ranking officials... or getting caught with your much larger best friends wife).  Old classics like throwing knifes make a return but they are almost as limited as the pistol in terms of usefulness. I'll recommend Assassin Creed 2, compared to the first game, AC 2 is like night and day, for being one of the earliest entries into a fairly long series I would personally say it's held out quite nicely in almost every category that matters.  So when asking yourself if you should buy AC 2, I'll leave you with a single question..  Do you enjoy fun video games?  If you answered yes!!! Then by all means buy AC 2 and let your inner killer out..  just remember no shame exist in throwing pesky archers off high rooftops..  It can be the most fun you've ever had :-)			",3681,1533,148,419,522,48,546

												If you your thinking of buying this game. Let me tell you, this game will put you under the hood of the one of gamings best protaganists. The name ""Ezio Auditore Da Firenze"" is one you will never forget. I must warn you though, that this is a 3 parter game, starting with the begining in ACII, then AC Brotherhood, and lastly the conclusion in AC Revelations. so plan to get all 3 on sale if you can, and prepare for the ride of your gaming life.(Xbox controller is highly reccomended)                                              on average i give this trilogy a 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is definitely one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed series and an absolute classic. The gameplay has aged decently. Combat isn't as good as later entries and at times Ezio seems to jump in a completely different direction to what you wanted, but overall it's a fairly solid experience. The story is the strongest point here, and the protagonist, Ezio Auditorie, is arguably the best in the entire series. The events of the game take place starting from his birth until he is about 40 years old, and you will notice him mature greatly as the story progresses. There's also a lot of different cities and areas to explore, my personal favourite being Venice.Try to get the game in a sale if you can, but I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to get into or already likes Assassin's Creed.

												I told myself i would buy this game. even tho i got rid of it on my 360. i preordred it in 2009 and got the black ezio ediiton. i still have the statue in the box. but not the game. and i saw it on steam and put it on my wishlist. so today was finnaly the day i got around to playing again, after not able to play the game for nearly 3 years, when i first got the game i was into it so so much. i wasted my whole life on it. because of how the game was created how the story was. how everything  was detailed. Free RoamOpen WorldA story of a child who grows up to be an assassinHow it has such amazing character designsThe graphic was good when the game first came out. but now you compare to other creed games, it's not that great. but it's still an enjoyable game.The game has many weapons and armors to buy. Maybe some parts of the game are repeative, eg looting, same combat, but you learn more combats as you pogress through the story, but it's still enjoyable until you finish the game. It's one of the best assassin's creed game created, i don't care if you think i'm wrong or not this is my own review and opinion.The game is set in italy and you get to travel almost the major city of italy.You can pickpocket!!But i know this doesn't says much about the game, it's just what i'v experienced playing over maybe 1000+ hours on the 360, it's one of the best assassin's creed game! and i recommend it to everyone who loves free roam, open world with amazing set in old days countryside, city and it has such amazing music aswell!

												Assassin's Creed 2 is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. Assassin's Creed 2 is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed.Desmond Miles was about to be executed but were saved due to the intervention by Lucy Stillman. It appears that Lucy is an assassin in disguise. She helps Desmond escape Abstergo. After some rough journey, Desmond finally reach the assassin's hideout. There he meet Rebecca and Shaun. Desmond needs to learn how to become a real assassin. So there he goes again, into the Animus. This time, Desmond will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, an Italian Nobleman.The gameplay then. Ubisoft really learned their mistake this time I think, and not just that, the gameplay aren't just no longer repetitive, but really expanded. You can now earn money and buy weapons and upgrades to improve yourself. You're going to pickpocket letters no longer, but you're going to steal money instead. Notoriety system are now included, which mean, the more bad things you do, it will get you wanted and will make the guards aware of your present and at some notoriety level, will attack you on sight. You can also now hire a thief or some mercenary to help you do some task or distract the guards. Ezio can now swim in water.The graphics are also improved. Ragdoll physics are even better than the previous and the Italian environment are really much detailed and feels more alive. The water effects, the skies, the textures, the lightning, everything is better. The animation may look pretty much the same with the previous game, but with better physics.This may be the best Assassin's Creed game yet. The game is very stable, giving you much freedom while the story still quite linear. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

 Introduction Assassin's Creed II, takes place during the height of the Renaissance in Italy.You play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the Assassin on a quest for vengeance against those responsible for betraying his family.The second title in the franchise, adds many features to the game. This includes the Hidden Gun, the ability to swim, and many refines to combat. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed II favors stealth over full-on combat.You can run, ride horses, swim, or use paddle boats to get to your destination.Parkour has been improved from the first game, which allows for smoother and faster movement. Combat The combat in this edition of Assassin's Creed, has been improved from it's predecessor, becoming more fluent with appreciated changes.Being able to use the Hidden Gun, will bring a whole new advancement to the game's combat.You can now purchase armor and weapons, which will increase health and change Ezio's appearance. Story As stated above, you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze.He starts off the game young and reckless, until his family is hung because of templars wanting to take control. Before his father dies, he learns that his father was an Assassin. Ezio goes to collect his fathers gear and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Mario's villa in the countryside. As he assassinates his targets, he identifies the mastermind of the plot: the Spaniard Rodrigo Borgia. Graphics Considering the game was released in 2009, it doesn't have the best graphics.Colors are quite bland, shadows are horrible, and render distance is short.With a SweetFX patch, and with 4k DSR 60fps, the game doesn't look that bad. Optimization Optimization is quite poor in this game.Frame rate will jump around a lot, no matter the settings you use. Bugs Enemies will attack you even when you block them.Bad performance. Personal Experience Beginning of the game is rather boring, and didn't interest me all that much. Once I got to the middle of the game, I really liked it and was really interested.Performance wise, I was playing on a GTX 980 ti OC with everything maxed out at 4k. I could manage 60fps, though it was keep dipping from 60 to around 45 because of bad optimizaion.The game was a great improvement from the first game. Pros Interesting story.Loveable main character.Great landmarks. Cons Poor performance.Micro-stutters.Bland coloring. Conclusion Great improvement over the first game, and gets interesting once you're through half of the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the Assassin's Creed franchise.

												As a guy that doesn't have a console to play these kinds of games on, I very much like the fact that Ubisoft modified this game so that it was playable.  Also this game taught me more about Renaissance Italy and its important figures in history than any of my history classes did.  Pros:- Good storyline and character development- I play this on my laptop; it doesn't run with very much lag a lot of the time- An enjoyable open-world atmosphere- Stealth is a challenge (Ezio would be a better ninja than some...)Cons:- The pc controls are strange and difficult to get used to.- Sometimes the audio glitches out.- The uplay launcher thing has been a bit of an issue, so I've seen.  (I couldn't run it for a few months after I got it.  What you have to do is go to www.uplay.com and download the newest launcher, then you enter the product key and play, and it works fine [yes you will need an account].  The reason the uplay launcher you get by downloading it via steam doesn't work is not because of uplay; it's because steam hasn't updated it.  Therefore it's steam's fault that it's so broken.)

												I never understood why this game was so popular and I never understood why people said ""it's the best game in the series"" until I actually brought the game. And holy sh*t what a game this is. For a game that's about 6 years old, it's.... Its just fabulous and couldn't agree more with this being the best (Sorry black flag..) The beginning of the story (Ezios story, no one gives a sh*t about Desmond at this point) had this charm of 2 brothers just being brothers and not alot of the get straight into the action bullsh*t. :D)And for the rest of what I've played... very sad indeed. SPOILER:  Y'know, Ezio's dad and some other family members I forgot being killed and all? The soundtrack is very, very good. Some of the music like the famous ""Ezios family"" are an absolute masterpiece Scenery? From what I've seen, it's beautiful. To conclude, buy this game now			",97,15,10,5,14,3,2

												It requires you to install UPlay which is an application that has to be on-line to let you play. By installing this product you are obliged to terms of service concerning player's privacy which I do not found to be acceptable for me.I will buy no more games from Ubisoft unless they drop their stupid DRM policy, which affects only legitimate users. I will save my money for other developers, who respect their customers, and I suggest you to do the same.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Assassin's Creed was a joy to play. I stated in my review, though, that it felt like a disjointed collection of minigames.Assassin's Creed 2 (""AC2"") takes those individual game elements from the first Assassin's Creed, and remixes them to create a game that's far more entertaining.For this second game, the developers kept the stuff that works (climbing towers, free-running), and eliminated the things that were less fun (eavesdropping, picking pockets, long combat sequences). You're doing a better mix of stuff in AC2. There are several indoor locations in this game, and the addition of storefronts on the city streets makes these Italian cities feel much more alive than the dusty, beautiful, barren cities of the first game.AC2 offers a variety of things for completionists to work at. Weapons and armor to purchase, art to collect from city merchants, Investments to be made in the infrastructure and services of the city around your family's villa. Feathers to collect from high city ledges, and a conspiracy theory to unravel. So many things to do! Bopping between them is great fun.There are typical side-quests: assassinate so-and-so in service of your mentor, beat up someone's cheating husband, race through the city against a timer, deliver package from point A to point B. Yada yada yada. However, there are also a few exceptional sidequests in the guise of raiding underground tombs or Templar hideouts. These are masterful puzzles, in which you must make your way carefully through a maze of acrobatic leaps and climbs to obtain a special prize. This style of gameplay in AC2 is reminiscent of Mirror's Edge or Portal 2, in the way it challenges you to puzzle your way through an enclosed area that is reluctant to reveal its secrets. These special side quests each take about 45 minutes to complete. They were a high point of the game for me.I have two complaints. First, I would have preferred more stealth gameplay, and an option to complete the game without murdering hundreds of innocent city guards. Don't get me wrong; I found it very satisfying to pull an unsuspecting victim off a rampart and watch him fall to his death. But the body count is very high in this game, and the gratuitous murder sprees don't really mesh with the main character's “reluctant hero” personality. My other complaint with AC2 is its excessive length. The gameplay here is fun, but it doesn't change much over time. What you're doing in the 5th hour is very similar to what you're doing in the 30th hour. I spent over 40 hours in this game, and I was hoping for a finale after 20. This is a rare example of a game where too much of a good thing makes the overall experience less pleasurable, less memorable.But don't let that stop you from playing. AC2 is frequently on sale for $5, and I can't think of many games that deliver better entertainment at any price. ",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												I realize that I'm late to the party. Assassin's Creed 2 is an amazing game. You want to be a mideval Batman, this game is the game for you. I'm sure you've seen other review praise this game as well, They are all true. I do want to point out a few issues. The controls are screwed up for game pad controllers. There are fixes to remap the buttons but its pretty sad they you have to hunt down a hack to fixed what should be fixed in game. Also during close quaters combat, often you will be fighting the camera as much as the characters. Still, its a must play game.			",1088,370,30,128,123,13,169

												An improvement compared to the first game of the series, also bigger game. Beautiful sceneries, captivating characters, immersive story and good soundtrack. You can explore, free roam, do the main story missions and optional missions, grab collectibles, almost in any order. There are items upgrades, new weapons, and skills. Many places to go and exploration to do. The Deluxe Edition includes 3 bonus areas, that are not important for the main story but provide additional game time if you had not enough exploration already. This game is worth to be played, even if you are new to the series, this is a good start. This game kept me entertained for more than 40 hours. ",1954,696,75,203,200,19,284

												At first I didn't pay much mind to Assassin's Creed. Big mistake. When I was gifted this game I felt like it would probably not be the best game. I was wrong on the highest level possible. If you're not playing Assassin's Creed, you're missing out. The fighting is more than just beat-em-up style. You can counter attacks and instantly kill enemies. You assassinate high-up people responsible for a conspiracy behind the death of your father, and brothers. You even have a pistol later on in the game! Plus, you get to kill a corrupt politician with the title of ""doge."" That's another bonus to people tired of that twelvie may may. To cut the story short:>desmond gets in animus to remember a second assassin named ezio>ezio is 17 year old boy>ezio's daddy and little + big brothers get arrested>fat guy friend of ezio's family volunteers to take care of him>fat guy says he'll free his family>fat guy is actually mean politician aristocraty dood>fat guy has daddy and brothers execooted>ezio gets mad and sad>ezio keels fat guy>ezio gets trained by his uncle mario>ezio keels off the rest of the conspirator connection over a 10 year period>ezio beats the leader in a fist fight and leaves him to rot in a vault, followed by meeting a goddess>ezio gets the leader's staff of godly power>ezio gets called desmond by the goddess cuz desmond is in a chamber thingymajikker to remember ezio's life>ezio gets socially anxious from unanswered questions and goddess leaves him>desmond gets out of animus and beats up modern templar guards and chases the templar official but he escapes>the end			",156,17,0,16,6,2,13

Unfortunately, it still fires up that crapware and makes me register with them in order to play the game.My mistake for trusting a Ubisoft game and giving them a second chance... but I really wish you would mention this stuff on the store page.

												Assassins Creed 2 was made close to two years after the original game. And it's really hard to describe it without going into what the game improved upon AC1.AC2 introduces a lot of things to make the world much more interesting. The sidequests are significantly more varied and dynamic. The guard AI more competantly follows the player and checks nearby hiding spots. The guards themselves come bearing different weapons and tactics to attack the player with. Assassinations can now be completed in several different ways. They added an economy to the world that not only allows you to customize your equipment and outfit but also utilize coins as a means of distraction. To top it all off general pathfinding and movement is a lot faster and more pleasant.AC2 in general is just a really pleasant sandbox game, and one that's worth playing for that. It's an effective mesh of well designed mechanics and polish, and there's little wonder why people consider it the best game in it's series.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												""Nothing is true, Everything is permitted.""Assassin's creed II is one of my most favorite games from this series and surely Ezio is one of best protagonists from entire gaming world.  Assassin’s Creed II is almost the opposite experience of Assassin’s Creed. It starts off looking and feeling like more of the same. This game is an improvement in every way over Assassin's Creed. The main improvement is it is not repetitive, There are many more mission types. The story of this game is strongest point here, and the protagonist, Ezio Auditorie, is definitely the best in the entire series.The cities of Italy are so much bigger in this game.This game is a true masterpiece and  must buy for AC lover :)			",69,14,0,1,5,0,2

(WTF?)You can hug Leonardo da vinci.You can get the armor and weapons of Altair. (The assassin of AC 1)Very good combat systemCons:The reason why Ezio became an assassin makes u cri everytiem.If u dont hug Leonardo Da Vinci he will make a sad face that makes u wanna kill urself.10/10 Very good job Ubisoft, we want more AC Games like this one!

												Improves upon the classic Assassin's Creed gameplay. Good story, large map with different locations and lots of sidemissions. I also like the RPG elements like buying weapons or armor.It is not as repetetive as the first game, but it has some flaws. For example the fight system is fun, but it's still too easy. I should also mention, that this game uses Uplay. It can be annoying if uplay updates otherwise you hardly notice it.All in all you can have a lot of fun in this game, but if you look for a challenge you'll be disappointed.			",100,3,0,8,2,0,3

												A NEARLY FLAWLESS AND MOST EPIC EXPERIENCE, INCHES CLOSE TO BE RUINED BY THE VERY DEFINITION OF DRM AS A BURDEN TO LEGAL USERS.After so many years I finally got around to play Assassin's Creed 2, from begining to end, I devoured the thing as if I had in my hands a classic of the golden era of gaming. Of course, it helped that my internet connection was down for a few days so it was just my and my backlog of games. While in the technical department it becomes obvious the game was held back by consoles, some texture pop in can be seen and the shadows, while full dynamic and very complete, they are also pretty low res, with no way at all of fixing both issues through configuration files. I really don't want to spoil it for those that still don't play it but suffice to say, the story kept my interest up all of the time, the missions being varied and enough side quests available to cover around 20-30 hours of pure content, with a few hours set aside to pick every single item available. Now, this UnotPlay thing, when I got my internet connection back, it decided not only to lock me out of accessing the Uplay specific unlocks for the game, it also removed every single Upay ""units"" I had. Uplay units are a kinda neat idea in that instead of mere achievements, you gain points to unlock additional game content. Be that media, wallpapers, songs, or actual ingame stuff. At least I used to think it was a good idea, because now I have no way of accessing that last side quest that you can unlock with UnotPlay points. So, my nearly flawless experience was somewhat spoiled by a totally unnecesary layer of DRM that is poorly maintainted by UBI. Even with that, I still fully recommend everybody to play this, and the entire Ezio Trilogy, if anything, so you can appreciate the decay in the direction the series was taken to, and also the terrible efficience with which UBIsoft ruins their IPs.

With the next Assassin's Creed coming this year (probably), I decided to play once again the game that put the Assassin's Creed franchise in it's highest success point.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Assassin's Creed II was released in 2010 for PC by Ubisoft Montreal (however, it was previously released in Q4 2009 for PS3/X360). Back when I first played it, I didn't know what to expect mainly because the first Assassin's Creed game was interesting, but very poorly executed, but since the media was giving so much praise, why not try it? What I found was one of what I consider the best games of the previous generation.Let's begin talking about the technical part - Assassin's Creed 2 isn't a perfect port, but it does work. The game don't appear to be very optimized to CPUs with more than 2 cores, and in scenes with lots of NPCs and things happening, I could feel that the game was running below 30FPS (of course I will let my PC specs later to give an idea), and I can't say that the graphics still good, they're acceptable, but most of time, if you take a more close look you will see that a lot of textures are in low resolution. Anyway, the game offer options to customize the graphics if you're running in a not so powerful machine, and from what I remember, it scalate pretty well in older systems. AC2 also supports up to 4K resolution, but it's capped at 60FPS. Now, about the story. It will be hard, but let me try do it in the more fast and understandable way:Back in the crusades, there was two factions fighting, the Assassin's and the Templars. Assassin's wanted to achieve peace for the mankind by giving people freedom, while templars wanted to control people with extremely powerful artifacts of an ancient civilization, because for them it was the only way to achieve peace and a perfect world. Things happened between that time and now (2010 - 2011), and those artifacts are now lost. However, a corporation called Abstergo Industries, that is controlled by Templars discovered a method to find those artifacts - they discovered that DNA hold your ancestors memories, and so, they developed Animus, a machine who could read these memories and also display them like a video. And then, they captured Desmond Miles, an Assassin that had escaped from his family and was living without any connection with them as a bartender.Things happened, we now retrieved his memories from Altair, an edgy assassin that was the main character of the first game and now, because of those things that happened, we're going to retrieve another guy past, but this time is not only for the info on the artifacts, but also to train Desmond - yes, with an updated Animus they could pass the skills of an ancestor to someone, not a direct transfer, of course, but during the sessions, Desmond will learn how to do things, like how to use a sword and hidden blade or how to go up high places and things like that. Anyway, during the game, we will not follow much of Desmond story, so we are going to now talk about it's ancestor that is also my favorite character in the entire series.Ezio Auditore da Firenze was a young italian guy from 15th century, doing young italian guy things, he had a happy family, two brothers, a father and mother, and one sister, but then pretty bad things happen and he need to get away from his house and city with his sister and mother, so he run away to his uncle Mario villa, and his plan was to stay there for sometime and then go away from all that. However, some other things happen, and he decide to help his uncle to fight against some bad guys. And then for some motive he decides to stay there with his family, and his uncle Mario tell him of the entire thing about Assassin's vs Templars, then he begin to do friends, like da Vinci, a girl with a dirty mouth, a elegant thieve and other interesting people. Then he go and begin to hunt down who made the bad things that made him run away in first place, and then he enter in the Assassin order, discover that his true enemy is now the Pope, and go hunt him too. Not in this exact order.Now, talking about the gameplay. During your gameplay, you will expend most of your time on Animus, since it's the main part of the game. You will be visiting Venice, Florence and Forli during the 15th - early 16th century. Initially, you will have open access of the parts of those cities that you have unlocked so far, and you unlock more parts of the cities doing story missions, but in free mode you can go search for treasures, do side missions or just explore the cities. You also have money that can be used to upgrade your sword and armor, however, the most powerful armor can be only adquired doing side missions, where you search for things to unlock Altair armor, in those side quests, you need to use your skills to go up in places, sometimes with a time limit, they're like puzzles based on skill. I didn't have much problems other than controls, and even then I didn't have to try more than 3 times to get at some place, other side missions include killing targets, beating unfaithful married men and important things like this. You also will have some collectibles like bird feathers and some Animus bugs left by the last guy who they used the machine. Those animus bugs unlock a video of Eve and Adam, those two from the bible, that on the game plot, rebeled against their creators, that are from the ancient civilization that created THAT artifacts and did bad things for them, and to unlock it's parts you need to found the bug, then solve it with a puzzle, that are like this one. This all I need to say about it, I think.Control wise, the game is pretty good, and I played with a keyboard and mouse setup. Playing with this may give you some problems to get up in some places or do some more advanced parkour, but it's not too bad. The combat is also fluid, but it kinda get repetitive in late game, unless you decide to be creative and use the entire arsenal that Ezio have - bombs, a pistol, poison that make people go around beating other people and then die and things like it. You don't need to, but it's cool and add some diversity than just kill people with swords.Now, about it's soundtrack, there's not much to say, it's just perfect. Composed by Jesper Kyd, it just add so much to the game, like this one while someone is pursuing you. It's so good.So, this is it. The Ezio story will go on in the two following games, Brotherhood and Revelations, and in a short movie that tell what happened with him after those two. tl;dr - flawed story, but engaging with one of the best characters created in last generation, not very well aged graphics mixed up with good controls and a awesome soundtrack in a world age not so explored in gaming with lots of things to do that may get repetitive compose Assassin's Creed II.REVIEW: 8.0/10			",490,120,17,36,41,6,58

												This game has some of the best character development in any game. You start off with Ezio being born, a small defenceless baby. You translate that into an irrogant teenager, thinking he is invincible. A family tradegdy then converts him into a mess of emotions. By the end of the game he has grown into a fully mature man, realising what life is really like.   ""Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted"" - the interpretation of this phrase shows you where he is at, maturity wise. Overall, a great game with many improvements from the original, but its the complexity of character that compells me 9.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Right out of the bat I'm going to say it... Assassin's Creed 2 manages to improve on (and in most cases) correct a lot of the 'mistakes' made in the first Assassin's Creed. The story flows more naturally, the environments are lively and invite you to explore... and there's no horrible 'hub' map that seemingly is just home to a horde of angry guards guarding pointless view point towers!Ezio as a character has more life and soul too, which only helps the story along. It allows you to easily get to know him and makes his pimping actions across Italy enjoyable. There's just something fun about running around the roof tops of Italy and generally acting like the biggest lad in all of Rome. I can't really explain it, but it's there - 'fun'.That was an element I felt was lacking in the first Assassin's Creed game where everything felt like a chore; a long drawn out chore with little reward. In Assassin's Creed 2 there are no 'chore' out moments to progress the game's content, the memory cores are all linked together and essential - so there's no climb a viewpoint, evesdrop on this guy and pluck a chicken style build up to Assassinations. Instead all story elements are told through memory segments, which allows the game to flow and the pace to build and fall in such a way that the game doesn't drain you emotionally or bore you to death. However, having said that I personally found Memory Block 12 & 13 to be totally out of place and to ruin the pace of the game. I found out that these 'chapters' were the added DLC, which would explain to the tacked on feel they had and the horrible pacing. All things considered looking back that was my only real issue with the game, which is amazing considering the mountain of issues I had against the first Assassin's Creed.Personal highlights for me were just the random events that would happen due to the Havoc/Ragdoll physics going a bit strange. Not in a terrible buggy kind of way, just natural mistakes happening such as people falling off buildings or running into each other. It was those natural unexpected events which caused me to laugh the most, it made the world feel alive. Also, I get some sort of sick enjoyment out of seeing Ragdoll death mechanics contort bodies... I'm not entirely sure why I've admitted that in written form, but there we go.I'll go seek help.The story was another bonus in Assassin's Creed II, as it expands on the strange historic, yet future pretense blend set in Assassin's Creed. Drawing influences from Templars and... Tron?! Well perhaps. There weren't too many Desmond scenes in this game, but the few you have are interesting and finally expand on his connection everything happening with Assassin's Creed.I don't want to say much more as it might spoil content, but I really enjoyed it and the ending... and the credits strangely enough. Overall, if you've been interested in Assassin's Creed but have been weary, I would recommend checking out an edited Youtube video of the Assassin's Creed cutscenes as a lead in towards actually playing Assassin's Creed II. The rest builds up and hooks in to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Revelations.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

												I know there were a great many complaints about the first Assassin's Creed game, and they're mostly well warranted. I, however, had a great experience with the game. The wonder of playing an open world game set in an historical era was such a mind-blowing experience that I found it easy to look past the repetition, the janky climbing mechanics, and the various other problems the game shipped with. Honestly, new IPs as ambitious as the first Assassin's Creed game deserve a little leeway anyhow, since they're attempting to accomplish so much while starting from scratch. Nevertheless, the game was severely flawed, and it rightfully got some flak for it.Assassin's Creed II, when it released, was a perfect example of why the medium of video games is filled with successful sequels. It's difficult for a studio to nail everything in their first try when, many times, they're starting from the ground up by building things like graphics and physics engines from scratch. So much time focused on the building blocks of a game leaves little time to flesh out the more dynamic aspects on top of those, which is why the first game featured so much reptition. Assassin's Creed II, however, improves upon everything that the first game promised. The graphics were superb at the time they released. There were literally no other open world games that looked this good, and they even stand up pretty well today. The cities were beautiful, they were alive. Florence is not a city that's changed much, and they completely nailed the feel of what I imagine it would be like at the turn of the 15th century. Platforming is improved, it's quicker, and it's more intuitive, but it's unfortunately not fully polished in this effort. When it works, it's improved massively over the previous game. The campaign itself is a meaty, lengthy game that's packed with content. You're visiting multiple cities here, you're visiting the beautiful Tuscan countryside, and the game is spanning decades. As somebody who's visited most of the areas depicted in this game, I can confidently say they've nailed the feel of the entire region. Ezio as a character is interesting, he's charismatic. He's an easy guy to root for, and his story begins personally and eventually emerges into a grand scale. He's been dealt a raw deal, but he lets things slide in a way that feels simultaneously incredible and admirable. Combat and player management has been expanded upon from the first game as well, as armor management, weapon and gadget management, and new costumes are all greatly designed. Customizing your Ezio is one of the most satisfying parts of the game. Combat is built upon from the first game, and now feels far more in depth. Probably the single best mechanic in the game is the build-your-own-stronghold aspect with Ezio's family villa. It's very addictive, and the visual change you experience in the small city is one that's immensely satisfying. As you invest money in building up your walled city, the population increases, the streets are cleaner and brighter, and the city is louder and more bustling as a result. I didn't realize quite how much it changed until I began a new game and saw how murky and depressing the place was when you first arrive there.One specific thing I'd like to highlight here and really stress is just how good the soundtrack of this game is. It's been mentioned before but I haven't seen anybody truly do it justice, yet. Jesper Kyd absolutely kills it, and sets the bar so highly here that he can't hit the same heights of quality in AC: Brotherhood or AC: Revelations. The music all fits the settings so superbly that I really can't imagine playing this game without it. Half of the reason the world is so immersive is the setting, the ambient nose, the lighting, and the architecture. The other half is all soundtrack. No exaggeration. The music is all ambient, and very low-key, but it flows like a satin ribbon, enveloping your brain and keeping you floating through the streets like you're walking on air. It's just so effective at immersing you into Ezio's world. It breathes life into an already beautiful world, and Kyd's dismissal as the series composer is a big part of the reason why Assassin's Creed III seems dead and less alive to me. The Florence theme in particular is utterly spectacular.This game, though, is certainly not without its flaws. Free running control has aged poorly since 2009 and can be frustrating at times, especially when attempting to move quickly. This makes any races and chase sequences an annoyance at best, and downright infuriating at worst. Ezio simply doesn't always go where you want him to, and story mission chase sequences are often purely trial and error as a result. Most frustrating would have to be Ezio's tendency to inexplicably stop when scaling straight up a building, and look the left at nothing in particular. This happening during a chase is especially frustrating. At times the camera is a massive pain during combat sequences, getting stuck behind buildings and spires. I also had an issue with the lack of a quick checkpoint restart option and fewer and further between checkpoints. It makes the light stealth gameplay here a frustrating experience at times.To put it with as much brevity as possible: This game is an experience. It's a thoroughly atmospheric, immersive delight that will transport you straight into this time period and make you want to do nothing but walk the streets of Florence and pole through the canals of Venice for hours on end, with no goal in mind more than collecting a few treasure boxes, seeing the sights, and listening to Jesper Kyd's wonderful score. I love this game.			",113,24,1,28,2,0,8

												This is where I started playing the Assassin's Creed franchise and I fell in love with this game. Although a few yeas old the graphics are still pretty impressive. This is probably the best Assassin's Creed game. It implements puzzles and killing. Pretty weird combination but they perfected it.

Awesome storylineOne of my friends is a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise and he made me buy the game during Steam Summer sale and play it. And I've to say, I'm glad he made me do it.The story was awesome. Kept me hooked for 50hrs - That says something. And the ending was really amazing! Totally worth the 50hrs.What really impressed me is how they've tried to blend historical and biblical events in the story and puzzles. (Also, some greek legends.)Reminds me of Dan Brown books. Especially the glyphs. Many times while solving the glyphs I felt I would've appreciated them more if I had more knowlegde about the mentioned events.But that didn't affect the overall gameplay experience though. Since the glyphs is just an optional side mission. Which unlocks 'The Truth' - which again, took me by surprise :)PS. I've already decided to buy 'Brotherhood' and 'Revelations' this winter sale.

												Holy crap, what a fantastic game! Turns out everything I've heard about AC2 all this years were true. This is a fantastic game and improves vastly on everything that was done on the first entry.Assassin's Creed 2 has a great and lengthy story, that doesn't bore you at all (like the first one may have). There are many missions types, which add some longevity to the game since you have lots of collectibles to collect and secondary missions to do.The gameplay and audio have improved severely: the freerun feels more natural (smarter too!) and there are lots of different weapons, that causes the combat to be deeper and more enjoyable. The voice acting is top notch and the music is very atmospheric, as is the fantastic environment and colorful open world. The cities, buildings, persons and historical events are accurate and very well developed. There's also a new economy system where you receive money as a means of taxes (via Villa upgrades), which can be used to buy weapons, armors, ammunition, etc.After playing this game, Assassin's Creed 1 felt like a tutorial. This is what the first one should've been and it's marvelous, a classic and a must-play.➡️️Final Rating: 10/10			",84,30,1,10,2,3,6

												Amazing. It's hard to find words that describe how brilliant this game is. I played ACII with little knowledge of the first game, but luckily it was easy to follow and it's well crafted. I can see why Ezio is a fan favorite, as his story is intriguing since he was just a troublemaker and womanizer who loves his family, when sudden and unexpected events lead him to becoming the famous assassin he is known to be in the AC universe. There are a lot of pros to the game, but to save on time I'll list the most important pros in my opinion.Pros:-Amazing story-Beautiful soundtrack-Outstanding graphics and scenery-Good voice acting-Great stealth system (blending in with crowds, sitting on a bench to seem normal, hiding in haystacks, etc.)-The leap of faith is always fun to do-Has a lot of content (my hours can prove that)-Each location is different and fun to explore-People react to you when you do something that isn't normal (such as killing a guard, stealing money, or aggresively shoving an NPC out of the way) adding to the realistic enviroment.-The guards are smart (but not too smart); if they see you tearing down a wanted poster,  going into a restricted area,  looting someone, etc, they will be suspicious and might attack.-Little, if any, bugs.Cons:-Ubisoft's trend of stopping pirating by having the game be permenently online can be a pain, especially if your WiFi tends to go out often.-Controls on a keyboard are a bit sloppy and it took a little bit to get used to.-QTE during cut scenes can be annoying  I missed the cue to hug Leonardo and it still haunts me -The NPCs that always serenades Ezio are annoying and tend to show up at the worst times.Although I have a lot of games I enjoy and recommend to friends, Assassin's Creed 2 has to be one of my favorite games of all time. It's a great, unique story with dynamic characters and fun gameplay and it's evident that a lot of time and effort was put into making this game. It's rare to find a game this involving and intriguing that has hours of content and is compatable on both PC and Mac. Definatly a must play for any gamer.			",43,14,0,9,3,0,0

												AssassinsCreed 2 is a game full of content being story , side missions , etc but its immense share of design flaws makes it feel inferior to its console counterparts. Dont get me wrong but-AC2 on PC graphics wise is through the roof when it comes to its console counterparts.The story is far better than AC3(for sure) & brotherhood.The beautiful recreations of some of the most beautiful cities in the world and their landmarks make you feel like visiting them in real life.Plenty of sidemissions.Ezio as a character is more relatable then all those silent protagonists that we see in games all around.Each assassination feels fresh and new(not like in AC1 if you know what im saying).You define how your target will die and you can roleplay it and be an assassin(in your virtual life)But(like i said) where there a good there a ugly side-Some parkour sections feel like they were designed for joystick instead of Keyboard and mouse.The keys that shows you what actions you do are nothing but cryptic images appearing in your HUD. You hv to go in control section and figure out each one of them.Unlike consoles you cant map your weapons according to your prefference.Either way i give this game a solid A .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As usual, this will be a short one. AC:2 is definately the best in the series. If you have played and enjoyed any of the other ones, you'll probably love the second of the series. The game is pretty, has a pretty solid story, really excellent mechanics, and just improves on everything in the first one. Basically, this game is all that a sequal should be; it took the first game, kept the same concept, then improved everything. Really fun, and just really well executed.			",189,25,2,15,3,0,4

Everytime you came back to a city to do something you feel a strong noastalgic feeling, even if only 30 minutes passed. 9/10 Soundtrack.I don't usually complete the entire it of the game, sidequests I will most likely leave them undone but the main story, ohhhh ohhh that is such a golden point of the game. Just gold, its intense and combined with the beautiful scenery and music your gonna call sick to work the next day. Well I don't have that option but it was 3 days, sleeping,  working, playing, eating something in between to keep yourself alive and playing again.Ezio and desmond are such a good characters for you to follow along, that makes the game be worth it.That ending, that twist, that feeling it leaves you ""I need moreeeeeeeee"".

												*Edit: Finally succeeded to play and the port on PC/Mac is a mess for gameplay! Ubisoft is clearly great at level design but gameplay is another thing. Sure you have sweet moves sometimes but when it clearly matters to achieve a mission, you can't get it right. It's impossible to enjoy the combat system because it's sloppy and you'll cram your finger anywhere doing random stuff or just blocking like an invicible tank killing 8 guards surrounding you one by one.I GOT 99 PROBLEMS AND UPLAY IS ALL.I bought this game for 4,99$ and it is still a rip off. Can't launch the game after mutiple reinstalls. The reason: UPlay.UPlay is an ugly DRM monster and is the thing that makes Ubisoft a really lame publisher despite good games. I run Tomb Raider flawlessly but when it comes to AC2 (a 2009 game) that third party platform cause problems you can't even imagine.Prompts, crashes, rewards nobody cares about, slowdowns, unsaved sessions, account ban....***Avoid Ubisoft games at all cost on Steam***Here's my advice Ubisoft: why don't you just trust your customers and together we will kill UPlay!0/10 will torrent next time.

												Fantastic game. Almost all the negative reviews come from people who can't connect to Uplay. I've personally never failed to connect to Uplay either in this or any other Ubisoft game, but I know some people have problems.One other thing: I definitely recommend playing with a controller because of the wacky keyboard controls; however, there are two files you have to download and paste into the game to get it to work correctly.Other than those two potential issues, neither of which bothered me, it's an absolutely great game, right up there with Black Flag, maybe even better. There aren't nearly as many of Black Flag's infamous tail quests (which I wasn't particularly good at). Anyway, grab it on sale.			",224,183,2,35,42,2,18

												I just played this for the first time and was compelled to keep on playing until I had collected and done everything. I never understood how Assassin's Creed was so popular after playing the first one and writing the whole series off, but now I get it! This game is a modern masterpiece and is probably the sole reason that they went on to make so many Assassin's Creed titles. You owe it to yourself to experience this game, if you haven't yet done so. The story and the world is compelling, the mechanics are fun, I spent hours just wandering the city, chasing thieves and assasinating soldiers, and the lore is fascinating.

												What seems like a typical revenge plot quickly evolves into an epic story filled with conspiracy and betrayal. Join Ezio Auditore, everyone's favorite Italian from the Renaissance, as he spends two decades of his life uncovering and disrupting a very powerful man's plans of world domination, furthering the struggle between Assassins and Templars carried from the first entry in the franchise. Whether you like to run across the rooftops of 15th-century Florence and Venice, gallop through the beautiful Tuscany countryside or simply learn more about some of their most relevant landmarks, the world is very appealing, albeit rather poor with side content.If the original Assassin's Creed didn't quite captivate your interest, maybe this one will. Weapon and armor customization, rebuilding an entire villa, new methods of evading and assassinating guards, lack of repetitive main story missions. The only aspects I can defend from the first game are certain moments in its storyline and the enemy targets themselves, as they had a bigger philosophical impact on the player.Completionist Playthrough: 28 hours ",29,4,0,10,2,0,2

												Assassin's Creed 2 actually changes quite alot from its predecessor. Instead of collecting information on your target because of the story, you assassinate your target as it is part of the story. And like last time, there is an amazing feeling about running away and hiding from countless gaurds on your tail right after a majestic assassination. Parkour in this is similar to the last with sweet Architecture to climb and run across, giving off a completely different vibe than the original. What's the best indicator that something is a sequel? Well the number 2 of course! Which is why you now have 2 hidden blades! Some combat animations are quite satisfying although i think its become quite easy and i still enjoy the slower paced clashes of the original with close ups of bringing down your enemies. Music has also seemed to be toned up this time around, and the mood just always feels right and nostalgic. Ezio isn't perfect, and that adds to the story, and I'll always enjoy Altair and the ancient middle eastern setting, But AC2 Is a blast with a ton of fantastic improvements and additions.

												I enjoyed this game immensely.  I played through the first title last year, and I enjoyed that one quite a lot as well, but every time I mentioned how much I enjoyed the first one, inevitably someone would retort, ""Yes, but have you played the second one?""  To be honest, I really didn't see where the second title in the series could be that much better than the first.  I had seen gameplay videos and everything seemed fairly same-y.  I get it now.  I still stand by the first game as being an enjoyable experience, but ACII winds up being an immersive experience.First and foremost the story in this game plays out on an epic scale.  The first game was great in that it introduced the concepts integral to the series, but this game meticulously crafts those set pieces into an epic tale of revenge, redemption and growth.  While Altair seemed a bit like a faceless soldier of the Assassin's Order, Ezio is a well rounded character with human strengths and flaws.  Over the course of 10 years Ezio experiences ultimate loss, and absolution through the Order and through his own personal quest.One of the things that's an amazing strength of this series is how it takes real historical people and places, and then interweaves them seamlessly into the mythology of the series.  ACII is astounding in this regard.  There is so much attention to detail that the entire game seems plausible, and further that you are witnessing a living breathing rendition of renaissance Italy and its colorful inhabitants.Another aspect where the game shines is in it's attention to detail in terms of intricate conspiracies, playing out over the course of centuries.  If you're a conspiracy buff, or a fan of works like The Da Vinci Code and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, you will likely find plenty to enjoy here.  There's just so much content to absorb regarding various political intrigues, and shady nefarious ""illuminati type"" groups manipulating world events behind the scenes.  It's a game that rewards you for digging deeply into its sizable database of people, locations, documents, decodable glyphs and various other errata.Naturally the the free running game play mechanics for which the series is famous for really shine here.  The other core element of the gameplay is of course assassination, and it feels and plays here better than ever.  For this outing Ezio sports two arm blades meaning that you can assassinate two targets simultaneously.  Add to that the various new and assorted deadly gizmos at his disposal (provided to Ezio vis a vis a very famous Italian renaissance painter and inventor), and he's an extremely formidable opponent.  In fact the game makes you feel like an absolute badass, regardless of whether you choose to take a stealth approach for minimum body count, or if you'd prefer hack and slash your way through the legions that oppose you (shock and awe!).  You are a walking razor blade, and no one will stand in your way between you and your target.  In regards to this latter point I should point out that the combat in this game has been improved significantly from that seen in the first game.  Ultimately the gameplay in ACII feels natural, smooth and exhilerating.  One element Ubisoft added to this game which really shines, is that you're tasked with raiding the tombs of various famous assassins.  These areas wear the Tomb Raider influence on their sleeves, but when you combine that with excellent freerunning mechanics, they are an absolute joy to play.  They're basically like a puzzle based free running mini game.  Awesome!One misstep present in the first game, that also rears its head here, is that the analog controls can be very touchy at times during freerunning and climbing segments.  I know I've raved about how good those sections are (and they really are), but sometimes Ezio will be in the middle of an epic freerunning line or several stories above the streets of Venice, when all of a sudden he'll freak out like an epileptic monkey on crack, and jump in a completely unexpected direction.  This will often spell disaster if you're high up off the ground or chasing after a fleeing target, and it can definitely lead to some rage inducing WTF moments.  All told though those moments are fleeting, and certainly didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game.I almost forgot to mention it, but the Super Mario Bros. reference at one point was pretty much one of the highlights of the game for me.  I won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it.  There's also a random pedestrian comment you hear occasionally regarding, ""a capering crusader"".  Ha!  Classic!All told I had a really good time with this one, and I can't wait to see where Ezio's adventures take him next in AC: Brotherhood (after a suitable cool down period of course.  Too much of a good thing is still too much).  My personal GOTY?  Maybe!			",319,90,7,42,13,3,6

												Best game of assassin creed series and best game ever made by ubisoft. Story is nicely done and combat and stealth are superb. As it is a 2009 game, graphics are not that bad.			",46,0,0,6,1,0,1

												One of my favorite games ever.Ezio Auditore is a lovable character who gets struck with quite the tradegy.  The story of his revenge turns into something of a journey that leads him to places he wouldn't have thought of before.  Everything about this game is memorable.  The voice acting is superb, the music is heartfelt, and the digital tourism aspect of the game really makes you feel like you were there with the characters living life next to them.

												This is the pinnacle of Assassin's Creed. You start off with the new great (and charming) protagonist, Ezio Auditore. Because the protagonist is new, you can hop right in here and not lose too much information. The Story is amazing and keeps the game going at a good pace. The gameplay is very different from AC 1 (less repetative, , no more mandatory synchs) and the missions are very diverse. The atmosphere of the game is very special. Each location feels different and is easily recognizable. Combat is nice (normal ""arkham"" style), while not as good as Brotherhood, it still feels nice.The worst thing about this game is one of the final missions, where before you can continue  you must get all of the pieces of paper across the world. There is like 30 of them. And it gets tiring. Almost like the Triforce Quest in The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker, but more repetitive and more pieces. If you want to try AC, get this one and nothing else.Pros-Great Story-Best AC Protagonist-Lots of Improvement over AC 1-Great Atmosphere-Huge Open World-Historical (But let's be honest, you're not going to read that♥♥♥♥♥♥Cons-uPlay-DLC is not worth it-It's not Skyrim filled with content-Lots of Filler-If not paced correctly, the ending is slowtldr: 10/10 would assassin again			",56,6,0,4,3,0,3

												Assassin's Creed 2 requires Uplay.Not convinced yet? Then read on...Uplay sucks and wouldn't save ANY progress in AC2. I wasted several hours replaying the game from the beginning since it wouldn't save any progress. I found a reliable, but stupid fix for those of you who still want to play this game:1. Go to: http://www.assassinscreedsavegames.com/savegames/Assassin%60s_Creed_II2. Download the save file you want.3. Replace your old save file with the newly downloaded save file.4. Launch the game and load the downloaded save file.I finished Assassin's Creed 2 and it's actually a really good game. It's pretty much the same as Assassin's Creed, but with some small improvements and a MUCH better story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed 2 is a very nice improvement on Assassin's Creed 1 as the repetitive nature of the first game is replaced with more varible missons and far more tools to complete them. Such as gaining a second hidden blade to allow for 2 kills at once, the ability to posion one blade to made enimies infected go berserk and eventually die.  later in the game you will also unlock a pistol upgrade.  This game also came with a optional puzzle elements that you can do that builds on the lore of assassin's creed. As well as side objectives such as rebuilding a town that has been left in a state of disrepair. Buying paintings from art merchants to add to the villa of the town you are helping to rebuild which will also add a steady income for you to collect which will allow you to buy newer armour and equipment throughout the game.Finally the story builds on what happens with desmond in the modern era and the continued struggle with Assassins and Templers in the past. The story  is about desmond using the assassins animus 2.0 to relive the life of Ezio Auditore a 15th century noble who is on a quest of revenge agaisnt the ones that killed 3 member of his family.

												First, DO NOT listen to the negative reviews for UPlay servers being down.  There are many threads explaining how to uninstall the UPlay launcher and then reinstalling a newer version.  Very easy to do.  Once you get to playing, you are pulled into a fantastic open world.  Almost everything in the game is extremely gratifying, and if you have not picked up this game, do it.  One other piece of advice is to use a controller while playing this game.  I am about a quarter of the way through the game, and I've been playing with a keyboard, but it's given me some trouble.  Other than that, do not hesitate to buy this game and enjoy!			",15,2,0,2,4,0,11

												What a great game this was. I recommend AC2 to any gamer who enjoys a good story with a beautiful world to explore and stuff to collect.There is a lot of info about the locations in the game, and those locations are really accurately designed and that only adds to an already strong and original story. My friends told me this was the best AC game of the series so far and now i believe them.Plus, you can murder a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people and get away with it #ThugLife9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed II, graphically improved and better control responses, is following up after the interesting journey of Altair, master assassin from the Third Crusade days.You return where you previously left off as Desmond, still imprisoned inside Abstargo's facility. However, not for long. Lucy returns and helps break you out, just to bring you to an apartment complex where you return to the Animus to discover more of Desmond's ancestors.Inside the animus you enter a time of Renaissance in Italy. Your journey starts through the eyes of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young man full of childish antics and testosterone. From here you live through the years of young Ezio as his world abruptly alters as he witnesses political turmoil and power struggles. This is obviously a sheer jist of what you will encounter.Pros:- Another promising story to enjoy.- Huge graphic improvements from the first game.- Combat feels more fluent and at times challenging when trying to counter.- Renaissance time, one of my favorite historical periods.- There is more to do, as in fortress upgrades, more side-quests, and gear purchasing. - The world is larger and vastly more beautiful in comparison to Assassin's Creed.- Ezio, though uninspiring at first, grows on you as you travel through ten years of his life.- Assassin attire does not disappoint.- Water doesn't kill you!- New weapons and armor customization.I personally recommend upgrading your fortress as soon as possible. It brings in some great cash every 20 minutes of game time. So if you need to step away for a bit, leave the game running.Cons:- Side-quests, as normal, can become tedious. However, they are not required to progress the story.- A few bugs still present, but not largely inconvenient as the first installment.- Parkour does feel more touchy with the environment.- I like the gondola, but steering it can get a tad annoying around smaller areas.Very little cons, I really enjoyed this game. I started it on a Friday night and completed the main story within the same weekend. So don't expect a 30+ hour story. This was a great upgrade from the first installment and witnessing some of Altairs legacy was also rewarding. This game will not disappoint and will definitely give you your moneys worth.

 Assassin's Creed 2 Retrospective Review Sort of...The Assassin’s Creed franchise is almost dead and buried at this point to some, but for me, a huge fan of the series, the franchises rest gives me a chance to go back and experience all the Assassin’s Creed games, before the eventual one to release next year in 2017. First, I started with Assassin’s Creed 2. I tried to get to part one, but for some reason it kept crashing every 15 minutes on my PC, and there was really nothing I could do that I didn’t already try. I do suggest however, that if you do go back to play the franchise, just stick with starting at AC2; AC1 is so far behind the technical curve of it’s sequels, that it feels like a PS1 era game compared to it’s contemporaries. Assassin’s Creed 2 is often lauded as the best in the series and for good reason. After the simplistic and formulaic repetitiveness of Assassin’s Creed 1. AC2’s diversity is a breath of fresh air. And diverse missions and combat mechanics are the name of the game  in AC 2. However, there are some outstanding issues that have occurred in AC2 while I was playing, that is probably due to just the age of the game itself. First, when it comes to story, it’s great! Ezio’s story is engaging and often keeps you emotionally hooked, but I do have to say that I feel as far as Assassin stories go, I think Ubisoft got better at telling an Assassin's story as the series went along. My only problem with the story in AC 2 is that it tends to be exposition heavy, but what I do appreciate is that it does have some time for heartfelt moments. The other little nag is that the story overall raises far more questions than it answers. It’s a shame since everything about the lore is incredibly intriguing, but for it’s mysteries to be revealed in such a piecemeal manner (which is actually something the series becomes notorious for doing as it goes along) it tends to leave more of a pain to want to know just what the hell is going on. At last the reveal that comes near the end, while exciting and probably opens the series for amazing opportunities (opportunities that have seemingly been squandered in the sequels) is not entirely satisfying. Now when it comes to graphics, the game is still a technical marvel. The environments and armors are so detailed that it makes them really feel real. Also another thing I’d like to bring up is the fact that people have started to complain recently that the series, in the more recent entries, has done all it can do to make it feel less like a real place and more like a game, but I’d quickly argue that AC2 feels like a game just as much as the others due to the fact that the Animus’ features cover up the screen in the same amount as the other later titles. Quickly, back to graphics, the game while still being beautiful in spots has terrible performance issues and some minor but irksome graphical glitches. When it comes to performance, it’s terrible across the board. Sometimes the game will drop below 60 to the 40’s for no apparent reason. I can output the game to 4k resolution and it still runs the same with the same inconsistent drops. It leads me to believe that it may be a CPU issue or something, but it is entirely annoying given that the game is pretty old. As for the graphical hitches, I fixed them with Nvidia Inspector which included better Anisotropic filtering, better VSync, and better anti-aliasing as all of the base features included in the game don’t work properly. The gameplay loop of Assassin’s Creed is a kind of all over the place, since Ezio at this point for the next two titles isn’t as nearly as fast or agile as his successors it usually takes a while to reach place to place. This is  helped by the game providing horses and some minute way of fast travel. The fast travel works only if you go to a different city so it’s kind of useless and the horses unfortunately are only useful for the country sides. The good thing is that the horses are fast and not slow. However, if you come up near objects and obstacles you can slow down considerably as the game’s parkour system desperately tries to determine whether your horse is jumping off a cliff or jumping over a fence even when faced in front of the fence. Now when it comes to collectibles, it can be enjoyable since they are really easy to collect and are often in near proximity of each other, which makes the act of collecting them all into an activity that lasts for about 5-6 hours. However I’m glad that a couple of the future titles opted for a “kicking the chest to open” mechanic that makes treasure collecting far less tedious. The feathers are another collectible that you can’t find in a considerable amount of time without a guide, but also provide and emotional side activity. The feathers in AC 2 actually have meaning as Ezio’s mother who stops talking won’t communicate with her family. Ezio collects these feathers in hope that his mother changes. It’s a nice hook that gives collecting the things more meaning, something that the future entries fail to do. The side missions are another part of the gameplay hook of Assassin’s Creed 2. They are enjoyable for the most part, but unfortunately ere on the side of repetitiveness a bit too soon, especially the assassination missions. In the main storyline the Assassination missions are quite diverse and unique, which set up a variety of ways to assassinate your foe, but the side missions which you collect from pigeon coops are not as consistent. There are some cool diverse situations, but unfortunately most of them turn into a simple run-to-this-location-and-then-assassinate-with-your-blade. Is it the best game in the franchise? Yes and no, for the most part I think most people have rose-tinted glasses on when they compare the supposed “♥♥♥♥♥iness” of the future sequels with the greatness of AC2. AC2 is great, but the future games in the series eventually surpassed it on a gameplay level, and arguably on a story level. The one game I think that definitely improved from a combination of the two is AC 4. On a technical level AC2’s controls just pale in comparison with the other games. Recently in AC:Unity I actually felt that for the first time being an assassin was an actual viable option. In AC2 being an assassin usually comes down to dumb luck, at least from my experience. The soldiers FOV for instance just varies greatly. Sometimes I would jog to them and assassinate without a fuss, but other times when I’d jog to them they would turn around instantly and detect me in which would at times turn into an automatic desync, which is incredibly annoying, as the game pulls the camera out and shakes violently  in a way that almost feels like if it’s telling you, “You lost!, Stop you lost okay, Just shut up, you lost! Restart your checkpoint, you incompetent assassin!.”  While in my head I’m thinking, F**k you game, F**k you. It’s pretty safe to say that the game’s controls aren’t the best nor is it’s AI consistent. Thankfully these things aren’t incredibly annoying as to deter you from playing, but your mileage may vary depending on what kind of games you play. When it comes to Assassin’s Creed 2, you can’t go wrong, you got a great story, detailed open-world, gameplay that is enjoyable, and a mythology to unravel. It may not be the best game in the franchise, but it’s pretty darn close. If you got $19 or better yet wait for a Steam sale, AC2 proves to still be an enjoyable experience that is still worth revisting.Some interesting points   I played about 75 hours    I got 100% synchronization    I unlocked The Truth    I also took too many screenshots    Also I played this game on an i7, GTX 970, Windows 8.1 computer  ",555,84,35,64,16,3,34

												As a game?  Good.  As a product?  Crap.AC2 is a seemingly classic game brought down by technical issues, including slow start-ups, various crashes/freezes, poor optimization and uneven performance.If you insist on playing this version of AC2, I suggest the following:- When stability becomes an issue, commonly in later maps, reduce the CPU cores used to 2 for the AC2 process (details on how can be found here: http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/480250-Assassins-Creed-2-crashing-hangs-lockup-Forums )- Avoid Alt-Tab'ing out, Steam's Shift-Tab, or any multitasking while the game is open- Don't bother with Steam Big PictureIssues will still occur, but the steps mentioned above seem to help.

												This second entry in the series is much, much better than the first, but still ultimately mediocre. This will not be spoiler free, as the plots in these games are not worth anything so there is no value lost in spoiling them.This time, there are no frustrating, repetitive repeating missions, or bland cityspaces. No awful dialogue and no terrible sound quality.You will find here that, unlike the first, this game could be described as functional and playable for upwards of 10 minutes.Assassin's Creed II is, unlike it's predecessor, a working game. I will argue, however, that this alone does not make it a game worth playing.You will find an admittedly more compelling and engaging story here. We are told the story of Ezio, a young Italian noble enjoying his youth amidst family rivalries and conspiracy in Florence. Ezio's voice acting is leagues above Altair's awful, monotone American accent. You may notice Ubisoft's laziness in making Desmond's and Ezio's facial models exactly the same.Anyway, Ezio's family is betrayed by someone thought a friend and his father and brothers are executed.One of the stronger moments in the series in Ezio discovering his father's assassin robes, the track 'Earth' playing in the background, meant to evoke a feeling of discovery in the player and prompt you to appreciate Ezio's transformation.The soundtrack, composed by Jesper Kyd(who is excellent) is likely the strongest point of the game. The atmospheric tracks like 'Home in Florence', the story and character-development tracks like 'Ezio's Family' and 'Earth', and the chase tracks like 'Venice Rooftops' are all fantastic. It is music one can love consistently and appreciate for how it establishes and reinforces the setting of the world. One can quickly come to appreciate the detail and beauty of the game's depictions of Florence and Venice supported by the fantastic music.The story is centered around a convoluted web of conspiracy motivated by revenge and a desire to discover the truth. The larger sin of this game's story, one that many AC games are guilty of, is putting the player in situations where they could solve the central conflict of the plot nearly instantly.More than once, Ezio is tasked with eavesdropping upon the game's villains gathered in a particular location or walking around the streets, completely vulnerable. They do not possess advantages or knowledge that would stay Ezio's blade, it is just some notion of absurd tension-building that seems to have prompted the inclusion of these scenes.The supporting cast is mostly ridiculous. The Ezio saga seems to have this weird habit of insisting that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, mercenaries, and thieves are all delightful people misrepresented by those in power. I would guess that it is a way of emphasizing that Assassins believe in humanity/are optimistic about human nature while the Templars are not. Both groups, however, see objective truth/reality, religion, and ideology as illusions and lies, so neither group is inspirational or compelling in any way, no matter what any fanboy wants to claim. One can summarize the conflict as 'secular humanists who believe in humanity and thus advocate freedom' versus 'secular humanists who don't believe in humanity and thus advocate order'. It seems the more interesting discussion and debate happened off screen and our position on the matter has already been decided for us.Anyways, the 'supporting cast' are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, thieves, and mercenaries. One tells us that prostitution really represents love and that she is doing God's work in running the brothel. Close of the end of the story, all of them jump out of the metaphorical bush and yell 'we were all secretly assassins guiding you the whole time, Ezio!' It's pretty poor writing. They then defeat the primary antagonist of the entire game and let him get away for no reason.The story, split into 14(really 12) sequences, skips years arbitrarily. My favorite moment is at the end of sequence 10, the game decides that the protagonist, with every reason in the world to pursue his enemies, sits on his♥♥♥♥♥for TEN YEARS in Venice, starting sequence 11 by lamenting that he'd been sitting on his♥♥♥♥♥like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot for 10 years. Really odd stuff with the timeline like this really makes you wonder about Ezio's character and motivation.At the end of the game, you travel to Rome to assassinate the Pope -- the same character who could have died numerous times before by Ezio's hand. After stabbing him through the throat, his papal staff apparently allows him to..not die from that? Christ these games have terrible writing.Ezio wielding the 'Apple of Eden' and Rodrigo Borgia(Alexander VI) his papal staff, they duke it out, Rodrigo paralyzes Ezio momentarily, and takes the apple. Ezio now completely vulnerable, Rodrigo logically decides to not kill him and just hurt him a little bit because that always works out really great for the main antagonist in any movie, book, or game. Seriously this♥♥♥♥♥♥is terrible.After that, Ezio chases him down to the vault and challenges the 60-something year old to a fistfight, Rodrigo posessing a massive upper hand in possessing both artifacts, it naturally makes sense for him to give up every advantage and enter a fist-fight with someone superior in terms of muscle strength and fitness -- potentially losing all progress towards the goal he has been working towards for around 25 years or more. After defeating Rodrigo, Ezio, being emotionally mature and intelligent and developed, decides not to kill the antagonist responsible for all the death and misery that allowed for the plot in the first place. Ezio was totally willing to murder hundreds of guards who who more or less innocent and just doing their jobs, but when it comes to the person most at fault -- no, not having any of that. I'm going to let you live in an overly-dramatic, angsty move that illustrates just how stupid my character is.So yes, this game's plot and characters are atrocious -- but that's the case in nearly every game in this series, so this game is not any worse.This game is worth playing for the atmosphere and high amount of content. You can enjoy the various side missions like the assassination contracts, underground tombs, and collectibles, free from the pretentious characters and stupid story, but with all the atmosphere of the music and character of the city.Ultimately, as I said, the game is still mediocre when compared to games that are truly great, but the amount of content, soundtrack, and atmosphere make the game worth playing -- there is something to enjoy here, unlike the first.

												Assassin's Creed is the first game in the series that integrates the elements that made the whole saga so popular. After playing it's repetitive and disappointing predecessor, ACII was exactly the kind of experience that I was looking for. ACII involves all the elements of a great game: elaborate story, beautiful visual style, exploration, character development, action, fun side missions, rewards and smooth mechanics (which were not that smooth actually, but later about that). Deluxe Edition includes all the original DLCs, so there're hours and hours of gameplay. For few euros/bucks on sales or even full price I highly recommend purchasing this game, if you already haven't.PROS:- fascinating story line- collectibles, upgrades and secret areas – it's all integrated in the story line, which not only makes exploration and side missions meaningful, but also constitutes a sort of economical management microgame, as all your progress in terms of collectibles reflects on the value and features of Monterigioni Villa – Ezio's HQ- unlike its predecessor ACII actually feels like a stealth game and there are multiple strategies for approaching and assassinating your enemies- tons of content- opportunity to explore realistic virtual representations of some of the most famous cultural landmarks of Renaissance and to find out about their history- epic final battle- da Vinci's flying machineEssential improvements compared to AC1:-no annoying beggars and crazy people-no hordes of citizens-faster and more versatile battles-no repeating patterns in the storyline or sidemissions-more elaborate surroundings-more weapons-ability to hire factions for your advance-treasure mapsNEUTRAL:- in the beginning, Ezio always is out of money, because equipment, repairs and collectibles are overpriced, but towards the end you're a millionaire, and after you have purchased everything you could, treasure hunting and villa upgrades become pointless; it's the same thing in AC3- I mostly used the sword, assassin's blades, throwing knifes and smoke bombs throughout the game, also occasionally the pistol; but the dagger and poison did not come in handy – fun to try, but other weapons are just more practicalCONS:- camera rotation – it does not always follow Ezios directions, which is especially problematic in narrow surroundings inside buildings (e.g., secret areas) to the point that it takes multiple attempts to succesfully perform a back leap- Ezio freezes while sitting on corners (a problem in chase scenes)- sometimes the eliminated targets do not disappear from the mini-map, which is a bit confusing when you need to find the next one- the missions towards the end of main game story were too simplistic and with some notable faults in terms of layout, AI's behaviour and navigation, as if the developers rushed the game to release it on time; but luckily that changes after you proceed to the DLC part of the game – the story is fascinating again and even the gameplay itself is much smoother- some puzzles do not make sense or the clues are hardly visible- it's not possible to change Ezio's outfit after Altair's costume is acquiredMy overall rating: 9/10.

												Time for a negative review that doesn't talk about UPlay.There's a great attention to detail in this game in the world, textures, modeling, sound, and, to some extent, the writing. However, this same care seems lacking when it comes to actual gameplay. Additionally, a few problems with the scripting and cutscenes really damage the immersion they try to create with the detailed world. Also, it's too long (I would say I enjoyed 10 hours of the 20 it took me to beat the game).As you put your first few hours into this game, you'll probably have a great time as you get a hang of the mechanics and complete the various different challenges spread throughout the world. You really have to stick with it to get to the part where the game starts becoming an unpleasant slog.The freerunning/climbing in this is pretty cool, but the moment you run into a situation where you don't understand why you can't grab something or your character doesn't do what you wanted them to, it'll sour the experience. It's very difficult to translate analog stick input into a selection from such a rich, complex space of possible movements, and I honestly can't see what they could've done to make this work better. These problems wouldn't hurt the game experience so much if they didn't have sections that rely heavily on these mechanics in a way that brings out the flaws of the movement engine. The most glaring issue is the sections that cause a memory to restart from the beginning if you are detected. For some reason, the environments that these missions took place in were prone to eliciting these movement issues. Getting detected is not only frustrating because  you have to start from the beginning of the section, but because it doesn't feel like it's your fault - you just didn't expect the character to move in a certain way. You're unlikely to run into this problem until you're well into the game.There's just so many situations when you are freerunning where it's not clear what your character is going to do or they do something you don't want them to do. Like getting stuck crouching on small waist high ledges when all you want to do is go to the ground, causing you to become easily visible to enemies you were trying to avoid and slowing down your movement. Then when you try to get off the ledge, instead of just jumping to the ground, he tries to jump to a handhold or another ledge.The combat is dreadfully boring. You wait for an enemy to attack and parry. Or you hold block and then hit attack in a rhythm until the enemy dies. For some enemies, they take lots of hits until they die, even with the strongest sword. It's unnecesarilly drawn out because of this. All they needed to do is to make combat shorter and less frequent. It happens far too often, even if you are being stealthy, and is just thoughtless. And it's so easy that it actually encourages you to avoid stealth and just kill everyone instead of wasting a bunch of time sneaking around.The stealth aspect of the gameplay is infuriating. You won't realize it until you get a bit into the game and have sections where any detection means you'll fail and have to start from the beginning of the checkpoint. For the most part, it's pretty clear when an enemy will see you. But, again, as you get later into the game, you'll run into challenges that are set up in a way that they bring out all the flaws of the enemy detection system (I'm looking at you, liutenant assassination memories). It could be made much less frustrating by either providing more feedback on why you are getting spotted, by having more frequent checkpoints, or by simply designing the challenges in a way that acknowledges the weaknesses of the detection system and avoiding them. This is the main reason I regret my time with this game - the ""avoid detection"" sections made me so mad, and this really ruined the game for me. Deviously, these frustrating sections come right towards the end of the game, meaning they'll stick out most in your mind as you think about your experience with the game.Finally, while they do an excellent job of trying to capture the historical setting via the modeling, sound, textures, and music, several key flaws ruin this immersion. The main flaws involve the actual stuff that happens in these memories being unbelievable or not fitting with the story. For example, there's seceral scenes where armed soldiers jump 50 feet down out of nowhere to fight you in a forced combat section. Or, the first time you fight the spaniard, you actually kill him by bringing his health down to zero during the combat, but in the cutscene that immediately follows he looks completely unfazed and isn't dead. Or, during the last battle with the spaniard, you have several allies that proceed to stand there and do nothing as you wail on him over and over and over, just pressing X over and over again until you get his health to 0.  These sort of strange, immersion-breaking moments are everywhere. Overall, it just feels like the implementation of the writing in terms of cutscenes and memories became sloppier and sloppier as I got further in the game. I almost feel like they were tricking me by having the game be fun at the start and hiding the unpolished, unpleasant parts towards the end of the game when I had already invested time into it.And this game just drags on and on without changing it up enough. I'm fine with a long game as long as it's still interesting, but this game is long and samey. If the game was half this length, I might've changed this to a recommendation.In sum, if you have lots of time and like just running around completing quests and stuff like that, you might like this, but you have a lot of other great open world games that provide that experience in a much better way than this game. Other than that, I would absolutely not recommend this - it's just not fun enough through the whole game and, while fun at times, will ultimately leave you feeling frustrated, unsatisfied, and whishing you had spent valuable hours of your life playing something more consistently fun.

												First of all, I must say I've got about +50hrs of gameplay of AC2 on PS3. I have finished the game twice and it is still one of my favorite game ever. The graphics are still good in 2016 and the story is amazing ! you should very get this game + AC:Brotherhood. In a negative way, you need Uplay to run the game wich I dosen't like very well... TL;DR: Buy the f*cking game right now.			",169,31,4,23,17,0,8

												Assassin's Creed 2 is the second game of the Assassins Creed franchise , and , said by many, the best one yet.The scenario is redistribuited throughout various citys like Florenze, Venezia , Romagnia and temporarily the game is located in the XV century more precisely throughout 22 years of the life of Ezio Auditore de Firenze.Let's evaluate it!Graphics --- 75/100 : The graphics on Assassin's Creed 2 are ( by the time of this review ) already outdated. While it is very ""chompy"" for us already,back in 2009 I believe they were astonishing.                                                                                                  I think, nonetheless, that the models of the faces of some characters ( especially the less relevant ones ) could be more detailed despite the age of the game.Sounds --- 75/100 : The soundtrack in this games offers plenty of pleasure moments especially when the city guards are pursuing you while you parkour in the XV century Florence rooftops. That angelic specific music suits wonderfuly in the parkour moments and I absolutely loved it.Despite the good soundtrack, some dialogs of the civilians were extremely repetitive and a reason to mock.Story --- 90/100 : Great Story! You are Desmond Miles, a normal person whose ancients were several generations of Assassin's. You are caught in a war between Templars ( the bad guys) and Assassin's ( The good guys). In the first title you are kidnapped by the templars while in this title you are caught by the Assassin's. Due to the low resources of the Assassin's ( that have to face a source of infinite resources that feeds the Templars) you incarnate as Ezio Auditore de Firenze as a way of seeking more information about the Pieces of Eden , and the  main goal , to train you.Ezio Auditore de Firenze is motivated by revenging the ones that killed his family and throughout the course continues the work of his father about ancient artifacts called The Pieces of Eden. Gameplay --- 85/ 100 --- Nothing really new here. Fantastic combat system that , in my mere opinion , could be more punishing.The game feels ,after some hours, repetitive due to a decent length in the story time. The social features of the game are well achieved although they could make it a little bit more imersive. In the end , the game deserves :   81 / 100  ",193,34,9,14,16,4,14

												If you are interested about the series, but are not sure how it plays out, I recommend not to buy this one. Buy AC: Brotherhood which is a better game in gameplay and level design. This I recommend only to those who want to start the Ezio Auditore da Firenze plotline from the beginning. For the subplot(modern day), one propably could go for this or the first. The subplot doesn't advance that much during one game, so it really doesn't matter. Ezio plot isn't that great in this game, it's a bit illogical revenge story. It's feels occasionally quite forced and all the side quests feel like just ""something extra to do, but not relevant in any way to anything"". I understand the game has a bit long time scale, but it still kind of feels funny that Ezio would be spending his time running races on the rooftops against random people just for few florins. Especially since florins are quite useless after 1/4 of the game.Level desing is good most of the time and the cities are quite interesting places. On the other hand, player spends most of his time on the rooftops. There's not much to see on the streets apart from walking people, so there's no reason to walk around just for fun. Also this game takes place in many cities, so one does not get familiar with any of them. General flaw in a sandbox game I think: make the city so big that no one never learns to recognize anything else but the minimap screen. Then again the game artificially constrains some areas as ""not available"" until later in the game. I also recommend having a controller to this game. I played my first with kboard and mouse and now I played with controller and it felt so much better, even though not as good as AC: Brotherhood. Especially since this game doesn't have a proper key mapping.All in all, it's not a bad game, it just has some annoying flaws and almost everything is made better in AC: Brotherhood. So I say I recommend this game, but with a grain of salt.			",193,41,1,16,12,4,50

												Assassin's Creed 2  takes place after the events of first game, Desmond is still in Abstergo prison when suddenly Lucy came to rescue him. After rescuing Desmond she relocates him in one of the secret assassin hideouts. This time Desmond must go inside animus once more and locate and aquire the apple of eden and become a true assassin through the memories of Ezio Audotore. Ezio is florentine nobleman who lived during the renaissance. At the age of 17 he witnessed his father and two brothers being executed which forced him, his sister and mother to flee to Tuscany, Moteriggioni at Villa Auditore. After learning about his heritage from, his uncle Mario, Ezio began his assassin training and set on his quest for vengeance against templar order, and their master Rodrigo Borgia who ordered the execution. Even though the game follows the cliche of ""muh revenge"" it's still pretty good story and gameplay wise plus you get to visit many iteresting locations like Venice and Florence and meet interesting characters of that time including Leonardo Da Vinci.The gameplay in first installment wasn't really polished, but in AC2 controls are responsive and movement is fluid. The animations are smooth, wide variety finishing blows and finally you get to chose what weapons  and armor you equip. You also have new tools to make your assassinations easier and more interesting like double hidden blade, pistol, poison blade and now you can fight with hidden blade and won't get pushed back and lose HP like in the first game. I also enjoyed the assassin tombs which where rather interesting and rewarding. Once finished all tombs you get Altair's armor as a reward for your work. What I really hated is lack of stealth in this game, considering the first game clearly established how assassins operate: they're never seen or heard and kills only key target. I also disliked how guards were guarding seemingly uninportant locations which does no good to the series and breaks immersion. Overall it's pretty fun to play but could be better polished with more possibilities like stealth for hardcore fans.The only downside I can think of is cancer named uPlay. When I purchased the game there was no mention in store page about 3rd party software. It is really annoying to punish paying customers by making trilions of accounts just to play one game. In this case it's Uplay. I don't know why I am required to register ANOTHER account just to play a game I already purchased on steam, don't make me use another platform. It is the only downside of the game, the DRM so if you're OK with purchasing it on steam and then adding it on Uplay go ahead. It's experience you don't want to miss out on. 8/10			",61,11,0,4,2,0,2

PROS:+ Historically deep and very interesting plot, full of conspiracy theories.+ Big, open, beautiful cities with lots of things to discover.+ Very fun main objectives which introduces new mechanics and fun ""toys"" :).+ Good character development.+ Lots of collectibles which are actually rewarding.+ New economy. You can purchase equipment and more.+ Graphics are also pretty good for it's age.CONS:- VERY easy combat and stupid AI.- Controls sometimes become frustrating and let you to make an unintended move such as jumping down a building or killing a civilian etc. But you get used to it as you play.VERDICT: Ubisoft managed to fix almost every problem with the first game and uncovered the true potential of the Assassin's Creed series. ACII is the true representative of the series; it is a masterpiece of it's time.			",191,159,7,26,22,4,24

												Assassin's Creed 2 is the direct sequel to the first Assassin's Creed game, a 3rd person stealth combat game that improved over it's predecessor in every way. The main improvement is it's NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.Your hero is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Whereas in the first Assassin's Creed, you were the main protagonist Altaïr based in Damascus, Jerusalem, and Acre. Ezio's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the bits outside the Animus) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note.The gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.Also, it easily has one of the best soundtrack. The music is not only original and cool, it changes perfectly to match the action in the game (chase scenes, flying, hiding etc).Pros:+ Platforming elements are extremely polished and satisfying; climbing is simple in practice and is competently animated+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous; renaissance Italy is wonderfully detailed and makes for some astonishing set-pieces+ Voice-acting is competent and on-par with the original+ UI, though it breaks the immersion a bit, is practical and aesthetically pleasing+ Bissfully short load-times; game's engine runs smoothly and efficiently+ Myriad collectibles and viewpoints to unlock, scattered throughout the world+ Animations are fluid and well-handled by the game's engine+ Assassinations are as fun as ever, with a plethora of additional features and options not seen in the first installment+ There is now a currency system, and a theft mechanic to compliment it; this can be used to upgrade arms and armor, which is exceptional in terms of aesthetics+ Missions and side missions are entertaining to play through, and enjoy a bit more variation that the original installment could boast+ Interesting plot, which does well to continue that of the first game; dialogue, too, is moderately well-written+ Can renovate and upgrade 'home city'Cons:- Requires you to have UPlay and a consistent internet connection- Not much of a re-playability factor after you finish the gameTL;DR:8.5/10Game is leap and bounds above it's original title, where in the first you would have to scan an entire area then go on to the next, rinse and repeat, as well as have repetitive combat lead to a very mundane boring game even though it had an amazing plot. It's improved on in every aspect of the game. Added with motivational points to strive towards to achieve certain things such as Altair's armor and upgrading your home, there's plenty of things to not get bored in this game about.

			This will tell you how to actually run the game... dispite ubisoft's best efforts to screw you.		


it's easily fixable, took me 5 minutes. Some people also might have a soundcard issue (audio playing through speakers) and usually a quick restart will do the trick.

												This is by far one of my favorite Assassin's Creed games. I've followed the series from the beginning... playing as Altair was fun, but Ezio just has so much more depth to his charecter, not to mention style. That moment you get the second hidden blade is just satisfying. Then ezio gains a hidden pistol, which was also fun. I've played through this game several times... IDK, maybe I am partial due to my nostalgia and overall love for the Ezio games.The game is not perfect though. As with most AC games, thee main charecter, Ezio in this case, does not always do what you want him to. Trying to climb boxes in front of you sometimes leads to running up the adjacent wall, or just jumping over boxes atogether. Most of the time this problem is negligable, except during the most frustrating aspect of this game: timed puzzles. Specifically, a good number of Assassin's Tombs. Many of the tombs have timed areas and if Ezio jumps in the water or at the wall instead of jumping to that beam... welll, you have to start over. If you don't care about getting 100% or getting Altair's armor, then skip these puzzles. Honestly, you can beat the game easily without upgrading your health much. The only reason I fully upgrade Ezio's heath is so that if Ezio decides to jump off a tall building without my permission, he will live.Wow, that was a ramble. You have earned yourself a cookie for reading this far.			",75,13,1,1,7,0,8

												Definitely my favourite assassins creed game by far. The story is amazing and introduced my favourite assassin, Ezio. The game might not be as advanced as the newer games like Blackflag, Syndicate and Unity but the story in this game is by far the best story out of any game (I have played through every game on console) and is very engaging. The parkour in this game may seem slow in comparison to the newer games but I find that you have a lot more control and accuracy when scaling buildings and etc.The only problem I have with this game is at times a very low frame rate(goes down to 10 or below at times) but usually stays at around 20 fps which isnt great, but is better than 10.I would definitely recommend this game to any fan of the series or for someone looking to get into the series.

												For me this was the true start of the Assassin's Creed franchise, with the original game being more of a proof of concept. I very much enjoyed the improvements over its predecessor and it set the scene for the next two titles with some pretty strong storytelling. Now that i have mentioned the story let me say that the whole animus/current day storyline does tie the games together with a bit more meaning they were (to me at least) completely throw away and i believe i would have enjoyed them all the same withouttl;dr  -  better than the first, with even better to come7/10 - would requiescat in pace again			",426,71,9,39,47,4,40

												For everyone who is whining about UPlay, why not check the community, this is a great game, and most of the reviews are about UPlay. I had the issue also, that's when I found this Guide: 


How to make Uplay work 
A Guide for Assassin's Creed II
By: 🐛🐛👀👌👀👌👀👌🏆🍎🎂☕

			This will tell you how to actually run the game... dispite ubisoft's best efforts to screw you.		


it's easily fixable, took me 5 minutes. Some people also might have a soundcard issue (audio playing through speakers) and usually a quick restart will do the trick. (And side note, controls are easily changed)Hopefully this helped and/or encouraged to purchase this fantastic game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just under a year ago I reviewed  Assassin's Creed 1 where I ultimately felt it was... alright... but multiple shortcomings and poor design choices held it back from true greatness. This time around, they've somehow managed to do almost exactly the same thing but in almost completely different ways. They've handled the story very differently, but still haven't improved it, they've tweaked the gameplay but inadvertently only served to highlight its flaws in the process, and they've given us lots of new toys to play with, but merely replaced one set of inconsequential features for a whole bunch of different ones. It's kind of both impressive and baffling how little actual progress they seem to have made from so much work.The first time around, the story shifted constantly from a future setting to past, exploring a particular family lineage, but it was such a mess of writing, acting and mishandled plot that it was easily the least interesting thing the game ended up doing. This time, the future setting is pushed way into the background and largely just bookends the game and its story, coming across as baggage the developers grudgingly tried to deal with as little and as best they could. To that end, we play as Ezio in 15th century Italy as he is unwittingly drawn into the midst of a dangerous conspiracy, learning of the struggle between Assassins and Templars as they try to shape the players and politics of the day to take over the country, and ultimately the world. There's more to this as the game makes call backs to the mysterious artefact at the heart of the first game (among other things *wink-wink*), but it never feels as grand or as crucial as they probably mean it to be, and just as with the first game, I couldn't bring myself to care about the whys and found myself increasing checked out of the story, my interest having already long since departed way before the anticlimactic end. Only two games into a thirteen game series, I'm already done with the lore and wish it wasn't a thing anymore. The kernel of a good idea is tangible, but it frustratingly never seems to become anything more than that.The gameplay fairs little better in its changes. The previous game had three large cities and a large hub area of towns, fields, canyons and various other sights connecting them. There was little to do here, though, so unless you really loved collectathons and sightseeing then you were bang outta luck and just had to endure the trip between main events. Thankfully, the hub area has been removed and we're instead given two very large cities, two small cities (with surrounding fields and swamplands) and your very own town to renovate. Once you're let loose to roam free in these places that's where the fun really begins, and also where the heartache hits, too, as what should be a simple joy becomes a near constant struggle and an increasing source of frustration.My memories of traversal in the first game are good ones, always having a really nice sense of effortless flow to movement. Whether it was leaping across rooftops or scaling up walls, it just felt right, and very rarely did anything bad about it ever come to my attention. Here, however, I literally could hardly go a couple of minutes without encountering some kind of issue. Ezio seems magnetically drawn to damn near every object and you can barely run anywhere near a vertical surface without him trying to automatically leap onto it. Dislodging yourself from anything takes way too long, and he pretty much only jumps from anything in a 90 degree, X or Y axis direction. So, many times I wanted to jump one way but it was impossible because it wasn't aligned exactly with the limited directions he could jump. Add to this the camera that constantly insists on ""helping"" you into new angles or straight up removing your control of it completely, plus its annoying sensitivity that was never decent no matter how I adjusted it, or the frequent frame rate stutters, and the whole thing was a never-ending battle to control adequately, leaping to my death on several occasions because of the bad camera and jumping/climbing/grabbing system.As with the previous title, the world itself and its scale is the star of the show which impresses most. The fact that there's only brief loading between main areas and cut scenes or missions is something I feel the games probably don't get enough credit for. Ditto with the sound design that really stood out to me on many occasions while they'd largely go unnoticed for me in other games. Visually, most of the areas are very ""busy"", which may make everything a bit of a blur of visual white noise, but I still greatly appreciated the effort once again in crafting such a fully realised world when they probably could have gotten away with less, between the overall layout, texture detail, and abundance of NPC models that fill the world. But, sadly, as with many other aspects, the busy-ness of the game also worked against it as there was a lot of what I can only think to describe as architectural clutter - basically lots of structures and pieces sticking out of every building in one place or another and getting in your way. It's clear they were placed with the intention of helping you get around faster or more gracefully, but it had the opposite effect on me as Ezio would continuously bump into stuff or grab on to out-of-the-way objects then take an age to let go of them. It just killed so much of the momentum and pace, and a lot of the fun along with it.Like I said, there are many new features, like upgrading your small fortress town, but aside from some aesthetic changes that you probably won't even notice, rather than unlocking new things, they only generate more money for you. But since it's such a non-issue in the game and you'll rarely ever find yourself wanting for more, this seemed useless to me. As too where many of the additional weapons and abilities. Again, the combat is a chore. I never felt engaged or threatened, just like I'd hit a tedious roadblock to endure rather than enjoy. But one of the most notable additions were tombs, extra challenge areas of sorts where you had to test your agility across obstacle courses and receive a small reward at the end. But, really, all these actually did were remind me of the game's main influence once again, Prince of Persia, except not nearly as fun as that masterpiece.For all my moaning about it, again, as with its predecessor, I'm rating it up not because I necessarily loved it, but because there isn't enough to truly hate on it. It never infuriates so much or for so long that it's ruinous, just occasionally annoying. And really, its worst crime isn't that it's bad, just that it's kinda dull and never becomes all that it could be. It has one trick that it repeats over and over, that makes it fun for the first five or so hours, but which I was completed done with by hour forty... go some place, climb some stuff, kill a guy, on to the next one. That's it. I wish every area was its own separate space, in its own time period and with its own character that only he or she would operate within independent of the others. Each would have their own skills or abilities (or lack of) and would require the player to play differently with each one, switching back and forth as preferred and completing every mission in whichever order they chose. It would mostly kill off the feeling of repetition and maybe even make the cities themselves have a greater sense of functional purpose rather than suspiciously coming across as filler impersonating content. Until that day comes, while I'm sure many will adore this, I ran out of enthusiasm for it far sooner than I ever should have. So, maybe don't read this as an endorsement of Assassin's Creed 2, so much as a recommendation for Prince of Persia. Seriously, those games are awesome.			",556,395,8,24,44,5,51

												Ezio is one of the characters I love most in videogames!He had the chance to evolve in 3 different games and the story was awesome, inside and outside of the Animus.After the Ezio era, neither hero actually mattered. The story was meaningless, the protagonists weak and the ""you're the character""+fps version of the present day is just horrible/inexistent.Don't get me wrong, I bought every single AC game that was released. Love them, they're fun to play. But none had the impact the 3 Ezio games had on me. Not even close... The cliffhangers at the end of each one of them were breathtaking and I miss that feeling...

												I now remember why I uninstalled the first installment of Assassin's Creed: finicky controls and restrictive kill conditions made combat a chore. In this sequel, Ubisoft couldn't fix the controls so they loosened up the combat mechanics, making your protagonist a match for even a crowd of enemies out in the open while removing much of the restrictions for a successful assassination. Instead of fixing flaws, they gave you more tools to navigate through the same engine. ""More rather than better"" seems to be the theme of the day. You can collect around 30 different weapons but darn if I can figure out why I need that many when there are only three types of enemies and you're encouraged to commit your assassinations quietly. There are a ridiculous amount of hidden chests but the bulk of your income will come from your villa and frankly, it's ridiculous that your main money pit (villa restorations) serves to increase your revenue. Between endless assassination side quests, puzzle deciphering and collectibles, I have over 25 hours of gameplay and am still roughly in the middle of the main storyline. This game is positively bloated with filler. What you lose from all of those extra combat mechanics is your overall sense of vulnerability in being a shadowy assassin. Who needs stealth when you can take on a crowd of enemies and still win? All I wanted was a fix to the backstabs from the first game; suddenly I'm face-stabbing a full company of armored brutes with only a couple of smoke bombs as my cover. Cheap, plentiful medicine makes health hardly an issue. All your methods for hiding in plain sight have been kept from the previous game but they've added ways to decrease your aggro from the guards, making your hiding techniques superfluous! An especially heinous mention needs to be given to the uPlay DRM which kept crashing on updates and various occasions. Obviously, I've managed to circumvent this problem if I've coped this far but it's still a frustrating experience to figure out why you can't play your own game. I also believe it's messing with my Steam Achievements, as in uPlay's Achievements are written over the Steam ones. This isn't sounding like the most enthusiastic of endorsements but Assassin's Creed 2 is merely a flawed game, not an outright unenjoyable one. The characters you meet are engaging, the exploration sequences filled with secrets and those assassination side quests might be filler but they offer some fun challenges along the way. The problem is that you don't *need* to do any of these extra side quests: your reward for those is money and you can get all the money you want simply by waiting. You play this game for the story, the variety of content and the opportunity to roleplay as a Renaissance hitman. Good enough.			",62,3,0,4,1,2,13

I downloaded the client manually and registered the game (it requires online activation the fist time you run it, but they lifted the always online DRM after players were really butthurt), works like a charm now			",349,78,3,74,39,0,93

												Assassin's Creed 2. What to say one of the best games in Assassin's Creed collection and one of the best in Eizo's trilogy.Story:In a vast open world environment, the game invites players to incarnate Ezio, a privileged young noble in Renaissance Italy who's been betrayed by the rival ruling families of Italy. Ezio's subsequent quest for vengeance plunges players into an epic story that offers more variety in missions, surprising and engaging new gameplay elements, diverse weapons and a profound character progression.They also represent a good mix of fictional characters – like Ezio’s family and his acrobatic thief allies – and actual historical figures, including the great Lorenzo di Medici and Leonardo da Vinci, who as Ezio’s closest friend plays a major role in the story.You can complete the main story in 15-20 hours.My opinion:What makes this game better from other AC games is that this game has a good story which it's well designed.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 9.6/10Game Physic: 8.9/10Sounds: 9.7/10Difficulty: 3/5Overall rating: 9.6/10			",257,57,13,19,31,3,23

Assassin's Creed II is an parkour beat'em up adventure game. Escaping from Abstergo Industries and joining a crew of Assassins, Desmond relives the life of another ancestor, Ezio Auditore, an Assassin from Renaissance Italy who sought to avenge his family's murder at the hands of Templars while uncovering a conspiracy of his own.Pros: This game builds on what made the first Assassin's Creed a success, while introducing a new climbing and combat mechanics. Although less numerous, cities are larger and taller than ever before, gaining access to new areas almost up until the end-game. You have a home base, Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, in which you can invest to get recurring in-game revenue. The story is interesting and intriguing, and missions are less rinse & repeat than the previous game. Although the graphics are some years old, they still hold as ok by today's standards.Cons: There is very little development with the overarching plot that made Desmond travel back to Altaïr's and Ezio's memories in the first place. If you invest early enough in Villa Auditore, money becomes trivial quickly, making sidequests like races and assassination contracts pointless, and you will make little to no use of the items you get from collecting feathers. Fighting can get somewhat repetitive, and late-game bosses pose no more challenges in a fight than the average guard, albeit taking more strikes to get rid of. There are no random events, so you will pretty much fast-travel all the time as soon as you've been to a region once.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!Overall, this game is a good followup to its predecessor, finishing on a cliffhanger much like the first game. It remains nonetheless a satisfying playthrough, and I'll recommend it to anyone who haven't already played the sequels.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Assassin's Creed II is the BEST AC game I have every played, the story for this game is fantastic and with the DLC that adds both Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities you will get an expanded storyline that is missing in the game if you do not have the ACII Deluxe Edition. The game is set in the 21st century and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The story takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy during the 15th and early 16th century. In ACII there is a lot of new abilities that the player has access to that were not available in the first AC. Now you can now use Eagle Vision in third-person view and while moving and you also now have the ability to swim. Now you can hire different groups of NPCs, such as mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves to help you fight, distract, or lure guards some thing that the first AC game never had. A day and night cycle has also been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time. The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. ACII has added a lot of new side-missions that you can access any time throughout the game like now they have added Assassin Tombs which is an optional side-mission to find all of the Assassin Seals to unlock the legendary Armor of Altaïr. Overall I give this game a 10/10 it is a huge improvement over the first AC game and I reckon it is probably the best AC game out there. I really cannot recommend this game to you enough it is just fantastic I am absolutely 100% sure that this game will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.			",211,18,1,20,8,2,27

												At first, I thought this game was good. Oh boy, how wrong I was. Horrible chase sequences, an endless stream of guards for you to kill with each mission(you might be better playing PAYDAY 2 instead of this game), subpar story, and on top of all that you get horrible mechanics and controls. After playing this game for 25 hours, I didn't even get to finishing it. I got to the last part of the game, but then the game refused to let me finish until I return to old areas to collect half the pages I missed. I ended up watching a playthrough and being massively disappointed. Only good thing about this game is the character you get to play as and that is not enough for me to recommend it.

You bassically live entire Ezio's life from moment when he is born to the moment of his death in Revelations. There is no doubt if you like storyline games especially sequels this is the game you need to get.Assassin Creed games after Revelations are just wrong, from ac1 to revelations is timeline which just continue, the sucky thing in newer AC games is that the Desmond dies (imagine that) lol and just not worth getting. But let it go, we are talking about AC 2 now, so yes grab it ASAP you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Could not get any asscreed game to run on windows 10. Googled around, it's a common problem. Ubisoft does not officially support windows 10. This game installs another launcher (ubisoft launcher), and I believe it requires an internet connection. Ubisoft is everything wrong with PC gaming. Never giving them another dime.

Assassins Creed 2 нь миний хамгийн дуртай хамгийн хайртай цуврал нь. Мөн хэзээ ч тоглоход уйдашгүй. Хэдий энэ анги нь 2009 онд гарж байсан ч гэсэн хэзээ ч хуучрахгүй гэдгийг амлаж байна.

												This game, in my opinion, perfects the Assassin's Creed formula. The story is really engaging, and I absolutely love the depiction of Renaissance Italy. The assassinations themselves felt fun and challenging to play out. There are a huge variety of weapons available in the game, letting you carry out missions in different ways. The side activity of renovating a village is also a lot of fun - it is cool to see the area change over time as you acquire more wealth. The game may be old, but it still feels fresh and fun to play.			",69,6,2,9,5,0,6

												Great story, immersive world and quite impressive graphics - these three make AC2 an awesome game, overall, and I dare to say even the best from the entire AC series. Even though I'm not a big fan of Ubisoft and their work, I find this game a special snowflake out there. Being historically inaccurate may be one of the very few cons for the game, but at the same time it can be a pro, a tone of creativity, an interesting way to see history from another perspective, even though it's fictional and fanciful, especially in the end of the story. That stuff at the end really made a mess in my brain, but I respect that Ubisoft tries to play with the history and human beliefs in this manner... Afterall, the gameplay matters a lot more, and this makes AC2 a game not just worth playing, but even mandatory for those who consider themselves true gamers.			",12,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. I highly suggest playing with a butter bread in one hand, and your mouse in the other. The keyboard is completly optional, and the keyboard actually decreases the quality of the game. Using only the mouse increases the difficulty sevenfold; I have been stuck on the first part for 8 hours. *Note: This review is based on the default controls*My rating with keyboard and mouse- 7/10My rating with mouse only (no keyboard at all)- 9/10			",73,5,1,8,7,0,4

												A beautiful game with a great storyline. Though the game has some technical and POV issues. Still I plan to play the whole franchise and wasn't sure I'd like the game with the parkour movements and all. It's much easier than Prince of Persia in my opinion -- even with keyboard + gaming mouse -- and doesn't take away from the game except in a few spots where the camera angle is borked.

												I love this game, I did a speedrun pretty much and completed it in just under 7 hours. It is a huge improvment on the original Assassin's Creed because it has some depth to the story line and isn't just Kill and Repeat. I played this game for the first time on a PS3 a few years ago and instantly enjoyed the freerun style so when I signed up to steam and quite recently bought it, it is almost impossible for me to give it a negative review. I feel like the people who don't enjoy this series have either picked up the wrong genre or are not willing to sit down and put a good few hours into a game. 11/10 would play again.

												This game is just plain fun to play. They made some significant improvements over the original AC game- the maps are much more detailed and easy to use, switching weapons is simple and intuitive, and the open- world aspect grants a lot of flexibility in how you want to play the game. For those who go for 100% synch, the ease of using the DNA menu, and you also have easy access to the Truth puzzles. The story itself is engaging, the main character, Ezio, is very likable, and there is a lot of variety in the gameplay. Puzzles, races, assassination contracts, and challenges... A lot to like in this game. Many of the details of the game are just done very well. A good example is the horses- the way they move and turn feels realistic- would the game be worse if the horses looked clunky? Probably not. But the attention to detail with something as mundane as the horses is indicative of just how well the graphics of the game look and feel. I believe I played through it 2 or 3 times and found new things each time! This one was much better than the original in terms of flow of the game and how easy it was to control the character.I have completed this game 5 to 6 times everytime it feels great for me and according to me this is world's best music game. I complete this game every year again and again and can't live without this:)			",21,0,0,0,0,0,1

												You play Desmond again who is playing a guy who is running around Italy killing everyone who is linked with the murder of his family. He is also is an art lover, and collector. This game is better than the first in many ways, but it is long. I felt more accomplished at the 20 hour point when I had collected every painting in the game and upgraded montenegro than I did in at the final story mark. Though collecting all the assassin gear in the crypts also was a big moment for me.Again, you can't skip the cutscenes, but this time they slip QTE events in with them.The game seems to borrow some elements of the openworld from Far Cry 2, which in essence just lets things react to you, rather thant strategically enable you to change the world based on your actions (as in the first game). Good game none the less. Loads of improvements, but the ""Game"" aspect of it all really ended at about the 20 hour mark for me and the rest of the game was rolling out the assassin targets and finding chests filled with f (oh and feathers, erg).

The game is amazing, and AC Brotherhood is even better, the game might be pretty old, but still way ahead of the time.

The world feels alive and immersive and it's hard not to completely get sucked into it. Running on the rooftops of Florence and Venice is an unforgettable experience.

Ezio is prone to jumping in a direction perpendicular to your intended trajectory, and the gameplay is really repetitive, but it's fun walking around 15th century Italy.  Also at one point a woman will challenge you to a horse race and if you win she will immediately get on top of you and have sex with you, right on the ground, in the middle of the day, in front of dozens of people.

												Редко в игроиндустрии встречаются игры, которые своей глубиной застовляют отрешиться от всего хотя бы на неделю. Но Assassin's Creed II явное исключение! Через пару минут  ты понимаешь какая гигантская рабата над ошибками сделана по сравнению с первой частью. Здесь переработанно всё начиная от прекрасной графики и заканчивая просто феноменальным сюжетом, который по моему является главным козырем этой игры. Из игры убрали скучные второстепенные мисси, ставка зделана на атмосферу эпохи возрождения, которая передана просто идеально			",407,84,17,38,13,2,42

												Absolutely loved this game, miles more in-depth and immersing than the original AC. Brilliant story line, somewhat improved controls, and much more longevity given the amount of side-missions available. Far less in-and-outing of the animus, something I found incredibly annoying in the original, and when you are out, you actually have things to do as opposed to listening to someone speak, 'sleeping', then waking up and getting back in (AKA pointless time wasting to make the game seem longer).The fact that you can live Ezio's life, by making money, speaking with family members, using different character types to assist you in missions, means you become more invested in the game. If I had one gripe about a certain character type it would be that the courtesans automatically leave you to 'distract' gaurds when they're near one, even if you didn't want them to and you were only passing by. I find thieves to be the most effective distraction personally, even if they do accidentally die falling off rooftops a lot.			",20,0,0,1,1,0,0

												The second in the classic frustration series, however we have much improved controls and a character who finally will not drown in a heavy rain (sarcastic joke there for those who cannot sense sarcasm over the internet tubes) The continuation of the story of a poor sap yanked off the streets and stuck into a machine to relive his ancestor's past (apparently his ancestors moved from the middle east to Italy at some point) and his (suddenly hotter?) lab geek assistant and their merry adventures in stabby-stabby-land.I kid, well not about the frustration levels, Ubisoft seems to love programming in what I call the D-Move (you figgure it out) where cameras suddenly wont face the way you need them to in a timed race, your character jumps off at weird angles not of your choosing and so on, but I really did enjoy this game.If you're hell bent on yelling at a screen until everyone around you thinks you're totally mental and need to be medicated then this is the perfect game for you, btw I had to type this review with my toes because the straight jacket prevents me from using my hands, enjoy.

												A sequel better than the first game in every aspect.--You can now wield several weapons. You have bigger ones at your disposal (such as two-handed swords, axes and hammers) that have different animations and make the combat look even more exciting.--Your protagonist, Ezio, can actually swim this time. This is a must as you'll go to Venice and you have missions where swimming is necessary or just helpful in order to get rid of enemies.--To be honest, I was not familiar with the era of the first game. Now, when it comes to the 15th century the second installment takes place in it brought back memories from history classes. It's actually quite cool that Ezio regularly visits Leonardo Da Vinci and at one point in the game you get to use his flying machine.--There are a lot of cities in the game with TONS of side missions. You even have your own mansion surrounded by several buildings. You can upgrade these and the economy system incorporated provides you with a steady income. --Obviously, the game employs better graphics and you also have night-day cycle in the sequel. Horse-riding returns and it still looks cool.--Enemies are more varied and you are required to use different tactics instead of just bashing the counter key when it is necessary. Also, countering is easier this time.--The incorporated notoriety system requires you to lay low for a while after a fight with the soldiers in town - otherwise you are recognised as the local villain and immediately get attacked by the next group of guards.--No more eavesdropping and pick pocketing as mandatory missions! There were far too many in the first game and after a while they became annoying and very repetitive. Thank God the sequel has more varied and exciting missions and locales.--The plot is more interesting this time and while Altair you got to know from the beginning as an assassin Ezio now starts out as teenage boy of a noble family unaware of the conflict between the Templars and Assassins. You follow his story from the very beginning and it is nice to see how his personality develops as the plot thickens.It may be the best in the series. This episode introduced a lot of new features that have since become the signature components of every Assassin's Creed game to date.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												The 2 more common complains for Assassin's Creed were the amount of bugs, and the repetitiveness of the level and mission design. And Ubisoft really learned the lesson about the second one. Each city is huge, very huge, with hundreds of side-missions, places to explore, objects to search and collect, a village to improve and much more. The plot gives a turn, showing for the first time was is really going on, and mixing science fiction with a touch of fantasy. And the multiple plot details, based makes the story much more credible. The visual aspect, even when is quite remarkable, is not what really stands out, but the absurdly amazing art and design. Again, each corner of the renaissance Italy is detailed, rich, full of life. One thing is disliked is that the game feels stretched, and when you think is going to be over soon, still has at least 3 hours of plot related gameplay. With only that ""flaw"" aside, the second title of the Assassin's saga is a game that I won't stop recommending.			",1865,710,79,230,238,18,346

												The Altaïr is dead, long live the Ezio.The game is basically the same as the first, but this time... it is personal!- Dumn Dumn Duuummmmmnnn! Camera fates - scene twists to closeup over the shoulder of an young man in the middle of ancient FlorenceBesides main character Raymond (forgot about him?) you are playing as Ezio Auditore de Iforgot and he is as cool and manly as his name is. Singlehanded trying to take revenge on the death of his father and brother he might as well suffer through it and commit suicide after the first 12 minutes ingame, but not him! He has so many girls to hit on - and he needs to rescue his mother and sister for an less important reason to stay alive. Anyway - Fighting his way out of the town, learning about the Assassin's, he becomes cooler than Altaïr ever was and you start to learn so many things that are really important for the super cool character that you haven't had forgotten now?! Raymond Miles, the boy in the Anuminus... Aluminus... in the thing with the memory ...memory-thing.10/10 way better ways of death from above than in the first game, plus: Character with charism			",470,303,5,62,51,4,63

												Set over 500 years before the events of the original game in the series, Assassin's Creed 2 is a prequel to 2009's much-loved game of the year - Batman: Arkham Asylum.Ezio Auditore da Firenze (it's Spanish for Wayne), one of Batman's long-lost ancestors, has his memories perved on by some random guy Batman Incorporated picked up off the streets as an excuse for training - and thus one of the greatest stories of revenge told in video game media begins.Following the untimely deaths of his family in true Bruce-esque fashion, Ezio decides to  take on the mantle of the Batman, protector of Gotham: Italy Edition and its people. Despite his lack of training, Ezio immediately sprints out the batcave and begins to clean the streets (a broomstick is a viable weapon in this game, apparently). With the help of his good friend Leonardo DaVinci (French for Pennyworth), Ezio sets out with a positive arsenal of exotic weaponry; from an early Batarang, which due to technical limitations of the time, only has 1 hyper-sharp blade, and doesn't really come back after use, to the grapple, which instead of attaching to buildings from a long distance, functions as a way of holding close targets in place - with optional fatal injury. What unfolds is a spellbinding and beautiful tale of family, redemption, revenge and mass murder. Yeah, the whole ""no killing"" thing hasn't really been established yet - but  let's be honest here, I think slamming someone in the neck with a car door and leaving them, broken, miles from the nearest hospital also counts as murder.Along with a majestic soundtrack, the game also improves immersion with a launcher inspired by renaissance-era technology. I found the 30 or so minutes I had to spend getting the piece of horse dung to work highly immersive, which, coupled with the painfully intrusive notification system, really made me feel the wonderment and awe of the renaissance.

												Combat and missions improved from AC1, **LOTS** of main missions to assassinate instead of just 9 from AC1. The stealth missions can be hard (read: frustrating/♥♥♥♥♥♥) but overall its a huge improvement from AC1. The story was the best part of AC1 and it is again here. The ending in AC1 was wtf, and this is WTF to the 100th power. Other than the bizarre/wtf endings, the story is really really good in both games.TL;DR: Good game, worth the price at $15.

												Oh how I love this game. This game is a reminder of how good games used to be. If you havent played the assassin's creed series befor, definately pick them up. Although the reecent entrys have been meh at best this one was and still is amazing.Although the free-running mechanics seem somawhat cluncky in this game they are still fun to use, although frustrating at times. when you arent under pressure by any timed stuff the free-running can be a joy and fun to use. The only time it gets annoying is when you have to chase someone of do something thats timed. If your camera and jostick arent in the exact spot you want to go, if its even a millimeter off, you can kiss your shins good by as you do a full 90 degree jump off into the abyse below. If you are chasing someone, expect to run up and jump over everything you don't want to as Ezio automatically decides to run up a wall you wernt aiming for ro to jump off to the left eventhough you were running forward to jump to the other roof.The story for the time was very intreaguing and kept me hooked. I orriginally owned this on the PS3 and i played it over and over again and loved it. The game is long and full of action and stabbing people. The game provides what the title says.My only issue with the game (other than randomly jumping off of stuff to meet my death) is memory sequence 12 and 13. Orriginaly this was dlc and wasnt included in the game for some reason, but with this being the actual ""full game"" it is included. Yet for some reason it felt really shoe horned in. you get to explore  anew district but only for like 5 minutes and all it is there for is to explain how Ezio got a map. (just for clarification sequence 12 and 13 a ""broken"" memories)For me it just made no sence what so ever and kinda killed the flow of the game.The other think that kinda kills the game are the colectables and lack of achevements. the colectables are there for you to unlock stuff. so when you colect 50 feathers you get a weapon (its♥♥♥♥♥♥and buthe time you have colected 50 of them you'd have gotten Altair's sword) and when you get 100 feathers you get the auditore cape that makes you notorious constantly. this is where the absence of achevements comes in. On the consoles there are achevements and there is purpose to these things other than to increace your play time. On pc its pointless. By the time you have aquired this cape there is no point in plying anymore purely for the fact you would have done everytihng. It seemes ted.iousThe only other down side is Uplay. If the servers are down expet to not be able to play this game. seriously uplay and ubisoft its self are the only things that make this and other games♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.All in all id say get this game and enjoy it. Its a fantastic game and definately worth your time.11/10 would Udon'tplay again (Seriously Ubisoft. GET YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥TOGEATHER!)			",158,23,0,20,10,2,3

												We'll never forget that foreshadowing exchange between Ezio and his older brother, Federico, after the two completed a rooftop race: ""It is a good life we lead, brother,"" Federico says, to which Ezio replies ""The best. May it never change."" A heart-wrenching audio track quiets in the background as the two share their appreciations. ""And may it never change us,"" Frederico responds. Then stuff got dark. Ultimately landing AC2 a spot on our list of 100 best games ever made. It took simulated stalking, breathtaking scaling and parkour stunting to all new heights.			",59,7,1,4,3,0,1

												Assassin's Creed 2, does everything a sequel needs to do. it added to the gameplay, expanded the story in multiple directions and created a highly memorable character in the form of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. It also lead to such apparent popularity that Ubisoft decided to flog the series into oblivion thereafter with yearly sequels including 2 spin-offs to Ezio's particular story (which where still decent if formulaic).The inclusion of multiplayer as well as an on-the-go manual and historical checkbook, and puzzle minigames made the game enjoyable not only by increasing the rich wealth of historical lore but adding much needed breaks from running over rooftops, causing tiles to crash to the streets below... This and Brotherhood (it's first sequel and second part of Ezio's trilogy) are the best of the Assassin's Creed series, partly because the game was still fresh and partly because the setting of Renaissance Italy was one of the most fascinating areas of history to explore.Highly recommend - will likely become a Classic.

												Assassin's Creed II adalah lanjutan kisah Desmond setelah kabur dari Abstergo dan memasuki ingatan Ezio Auditore, assassin di jaman Renaissance.Cerita (8/10)Cerita tentang Ezio jauh lebih detail & menarik daripada Altair di AC I. Ceritanya pun lebih seru dengan melibatkan tokoh nyata dalam sejarah seperti Lorenzo De Medici & Leonardo Da Vinci. Adanya subtitle sekarang juga mempermudah pemahaman cerita. Gameplay (9/10)Gameplay yg ditawarkan lebih bervariasi. Bukan hanya menguping, mencopet dan membunuh yg terkesan membosankan di AC I, AC II memberikan banyak mini game sepanjang jalan cerita. Salah satu yang paling menarik adalah terbang ala paralayang dengan alat ciptaan Leonardo Da Vinci.AC II juga membuat Ezio bisa berenang, tidak seperti Altair di AC I yg selalu 'desynchronized' tiap masuk kolam air.Dan yang tidak kalah penting, Ezio punya uang untuk beli armor / senjata, tidak seperti Altair yang terkesan tidak bawa uang sama sekali sepanjang cerita. Grafis (8/10)Perbaikan grafis yang paling terasa adalah adanya adegan sinematik seperti menonton film. NPC dan lingkungan yang ada juga semakin bervariasi & berwarna dibanding AC I yang mungkin terkesan monoton di tiap kota.			",30,9,1,7,1,0,1

												This is one hell of a sequel i tell you that. The story and gameplay are magnificent aswell as the voice acting. Though the sound and the gameplay itself has some bugs. There has been a huge change since AC1 and its not a bad thing (you are more free). The mission are not as challenging as the first game but it makes you more certain that you are going to complete the game, its not like some other games where you get stuck on multiple missions and never get through (dark souls). Anyway this game i worth buying if you are a assassins creed fan or if you just want a game with a great story.			",163,10,4,8,13,1,22

												Another unexpected good game. The open world is superb with a lot of things to do in there, can play hours and hours of random gameplay without doing any missions xD.  I also like the parkour part of the game. The story is also quite interesting and unique.			",58,5,0,3,9,0,5

												Assassin's Creed II continues where AC1 stopped, Templars are still trying to locate Pieces of Eden using the genetic memories from the Assassin descedant Desmond using the Animus. In ACII you'll play as Ezio Auditore, son of an Assassin from Italy, during the Renaissance and easily the favourite character of most AC fans.Assassin's Creed II is by far the very best of the franchise and it was the game that boosted the popularity of AC series.Pros and cons:Pros: • Ezio Auditore• Amazing story;• Amazing characters;• Amazing scenarios;• Gorgeous robes and armors (seriously, Assassin Robes are wonderful, I wish we'd dress like that today);• Lots of replay value.Cons:• Repetitive gameplay (it's not as bad as AC1 though);• Repetitive combat mechanics;• The mission you need to fly (seriously, that's the only thing that ruin the game).This game did try to make right what AC1 did wrong, and it did in parts.While the game is still a bit repetitive, it's a lot better than AC1 was, you have a little more freedom, you have subtitles, the story is better explained, the characters are better.Overall this game was a huge improvement over AC1.As I said above, this game is easily the best in the franchise and it's the game that made me LOVE Assassin's Creed.

												I played (and finished) this game 4 times: 3 times on Xbox 360 and the fourth time on PC.Do i reccomend this game? Absolutely,YES.I'm an Assassin's Creed fan,i played all the chapters and trust me,this is the best in the series.Italy is great,a beautiful place,the Story is compelling,sometimes funny,and mostly,exciting.Ezio too is the best protagonist in the series,charismatic,fair and combative.The game is dubbed in many languages,like English,italian,French,Spanish,Japenese and others,but the best is the italian one.I would not recommend the others,cause the characters speak a half Italian and a half the other,so they sound so bad. (i'm italian.)One of the best games ever made.VOTE: 9.5/10 Buy it ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The war rages on between the Assassins and the Templars, this time the two groups have ""officially"" disbanded, while their fight still continues in the shadows. Sadly this game marks a fall from the grey morality featured in the first game, with rather simplistic villains and side characters, with Ezio being the only character that truly stand out in the game, reverable in the same lines of Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr.The gameplay and mission design has been signifigantly imrpoved in this iteration, including side missions. Although some of the side missions are rather mundane and don't make sense overall with the story, they are nice deviations and most of the side missions are rather enjoyable.Desmond's story falls short in this one, barring the introduction of side characters such as Rebecca and Shaun, because you are restricted to the Animus for most of the game and you aren't free to get out and walk around whenever you wish.91/100			",140,20,1,19,1,0,12

												Assassin's Creed II adalah lanjutan kisah Desmond setelah kabur dari Abstergo dan memasuki ingatan Ezio Auditore, assassin di jaman Renaissance.Cerita (8/10)Cerita tentang Ezio jauh lebih detail & menarik daripada Altair di AC I. Ceritanya pun lebih seru dengan melibatkan tokoh nyata dalam sejarah seperti Lorenzo De Medici & Leonardo Da Vinci. Adanya subtitle sekarang juga mempermudah pemahaman cerita. Gameplay (9/10)Gameplay yg ditawarkan lebih bervariasi. Bukan hanya menguping, mencopet dan membunuh yg terkesan membosankan di AC I, AC II memberikan banyak mini game sepanjang jalan cerita. Salah satu yang paling menarik adalah terbang ala paralayang dengan alat ciptaan Leonardo Da Vinci.AC II juga membuat Ezio bisa berenang, tidak seperti Altair di AC I yg selalu 'desynchronized' tiap masuk kolam air.Dan yang tidak kalah penting, Ezio punya uang untuk beli armor / senjata, tidak seperti Altair yang terkesan tidak bawa uang sama sekali sepanjang cerita. Grafis (8/10)Perbaikan grafis yang paling terasa adalah adanya adegan sinematik seperti menonton film. NPC dan lingkungan yang ada juga semakin bervariasi & berwarna dibanding AC I yang mungkin terkesan monoton di tiap kota.			",30,9,1,7,1,0,1

												I fell in love with this game after I beat the crap out of AC Revelations.  I love the AC genre.  I've played all the series, but this is the only one that I truly annialated all the way through.  I have 58 hours logged in this game and I can come back to it just about anytime to check on my victories.  The only collection I haven't completed in this game is the feather collection.  If I decide to get back into the animus, I'll use a walkthroguh to find all the feathers for my next attempt.  I highly recommed playing through this.  Ezio is one of the funnest charcters I've had the opportunity to learn.			",17,1,0,1,3,0,3

												Oh how I love this game. This game is a reminder of how good games used to be. If you havent played the assassin's creed series befor, definately pick them up. Although the reecent entrys have been meh at best this one was and still is amazing.Although the free-running mechanics seem somawhat cluncky in this game they are still fun to use, although frustrating at times. when you arent under pressure by any timed stuff the free-running can be a joy and fun to use. The only time it gets annoying is when you have to chase someone of do something thats timed. If your camera and jostick arent in the exact spot you want to go, if its even a millimeter off, you can kiss your shins good by as you do a full 90 degree jump off into the abyse below. If you are chasing someone, expect to run up and jump over everything you don't want to as Ezio automatically decides to run up a wall you wernt aiming for ro to jump off to the left eventhough you were running forward to jump to the other roof.The story for the time was very intreaguing and kept me hooked. I orriginally owned this on the PS3 and i played it over and over again and loved it. The game is long and full of action and stabbing people. The game provides what the title says.My only issue with the game (other than randomly jumping off of stuff to meet my death) is memory sequence 12 and 13. Orriginaly this was dlc and wasnt included in the game for some reason, but with this being the actual ""full game"" it is included. Yet for some reason it felt really shoe horned in. you get to explore  anew district but only for like 5 minutes and all it is there for is to explain how Ezio got a map. (just for clarification sequence 12 and 13 a ""broken"" memories)For me it just made no sence what so ever and kinda killed the flow of the game.The other think that kinda kills the game are the colectables and lack of achevements. the colectables are there for you to unlock stuff. so when you colect 50 feathers you get a weapon (its♥♥♥♥♥♥and buthe time you have colected 50 of them you'd have gotten Altair's sword) and when you get 100 feathers you get the auditore cape that makes you notorious constantly. this is where the absence of achevements comes in. On the consoles there are achevements and there is purpose to these things other than to increace your play time. On pc its pointless. By the time you have aquired this cape there is no point in plying anymore purely for the fact you would have done everytihng. It seemes ted.iousThe only other down side is Uplay. If the servers are down expet to not be able to play this game. seriously uplay and ubisoft its self are the only things that make this and other games♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.All in all id say get this game and enjoy it. Its a fantastic game and definately worth your time.11/10 would Udon'tplay again (Seriously Ubisoft. GET YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥TOGEATHER!)			",158,23,0,20,10,2,3

												I just finished the game and I have a very strange feeling about it. I can't stop myself to measure it to the first game. But generally I liked it.First of all, the first class work what the team of the Ubisoft done with places, clothes and conversations is magnificent. It really makes you feel, that you are in the renessaince. The good old fighting system don't make any dissapointment and the guards' AI has got better, there are fast ones who can outrun you and there is inteligent ones, who can find you, and there are more fighting style of them too. And what was a great relief for me, our main character finally can swim. Yeah! It was really annoying that the almost super human assassin drowned in the every little water. The beginning of the story is quite good, it just continues where the first left off. But Ezio won't be my favorite: a spoiled kid at the first and that won't really change untill the last chapters. Altair was a complex character with serious character development. Many times in the conversations, when Ezio tries to think, I just thought 'Oh, man'. But stories' rhythm is quite curious I felt aprox. three-four time a peak, where I got the feeling that the game will end now and... It did not end, it was ok once or twice, but after that it was too much for me. The side quests were interesting and the restauration of Montereggioni Villa was quite a good idea. I really liked and waited when can I pay the last of my money on her. The assassins tombs were a good basic idea to take some dexterity game in the thing, it made the game more diverse. Searching for codex pages and the truth was exciting too, but the glyph puzzles were not balanced, some of it is too easy and some is really hard, and it do not really have a order, that it goes from the easy to the hard.An another thing deserve a word. I think Leonardo is the best sidekick ever. I like his style and he was useful, but did not pamper Ezio. The thing, that we can choose weapons, outfits and even the color of our clothes are convinient, while it let us choose our  fighting style, wether we like heavy or light and fast weapons, it is up to us. And the developing of the handblade season it too.So in summary I liked this game. There were really good ideas, which made interesting side lines for the player. We could explore a little beside the main quest line. But Altair's character is more complex and more interesting than Ezio's. And rhythm of the last chapters were not the just the real thing for me.			",27,10,0,6,2,0,2

												Although the controls leave something to desired (actually, they leave a lot to be desired, and can be really frustrating at first), this game is an overall excellent combination of great story, nice graphics, great ambience and soundtrack, etc. The gameplay itself is top-notch and the mechanics are awesome and really entertaining. If you were turned off by the first Assassin's Creed, this is definitely an improvement, including a better setting (15th century Italy).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed 2, does everything a sequel needs to do. it added to the gameplay, expanded the story in multiple directions and created a highly memorable character in the form of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. It also lead to such apparent popularity that Ubisoft decided to flog the series into oblivion thereafter with yearly sequels including 2 spin-offs to Ezio's particular story (which where still decent if formulaic).The inclusion of multiplayer as well as an on-the-go manual and historical checkbook, and puzzle minigames made the game enjoyable not only by increasing the rich wealth of historical lore but adding much needed breaks from running over rooftops, causing tiles to crash to the streets below... This and Brotherhood (it's first sequel and second part of Ezio's trilogy) are the best of the Assassin's Creed series, partly because the game was still fresh and partly because the setting of Renaissance Italy was one of the most fascinating areas of history to explore.Highly recommend - will likely become a Classic.

Posted: January 8
												It's been a great many years since I've played this game. Much like Pajama Sam and Star Wars, I was very much obsessed with the Assassin's Creed franchise. Don't worry. I haven't turned into a murderous psychopath. Not yet at least.I played most of the Assassin's Creed games multiple times, but I haven't touched II since I first played it. I remember hating it purely for the graphics back in the day, but I'm happy to report that my taste in games has matured. Now let's REALLY find out what I didn't like about this game!To be honest, not a whole lot. Assassin's Creed II is well-justified in being called the best game in the franchise by fans and critics alike. And I mean that as sincerely as I can. It's a pretty enjoyable game.The story continues right off of the first Assassin's Creed (which I might go back and play a third time for sh**s and giggles soon), wherein you play as Desmond Miles as he accesses memories now of Italian ancestor from Renaissance: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Desmond's story is nearly inexistent, but where the real juice of the the story comes from is found in Ezio.See, Ezio isn't a stone-faced brooding Batman-wannabe like Altair and Connor Kenway were. He was presented like an young man who was thrown into unfortunate circumstances and had to dawn the cowl of the Assassin in order to fulfill his quest for revenge. Ezio is very charismatic and likeable, and you genuinely want to see him follow through with his revenge and become a Master Assassin. A lot of the other characters are pretty forgettable, but the game has so much charm and enough little jokes here and there that I felt entertained throughout the whole experience.Besides the other characters, I did get a little irritated with how one-dimensional the villains were. The only one that really got my interest was the bodyguard, Dante, and he's barely used in the whole game! I felt a bit of rivalry between Ezio and Uberto as well as Vieri, but a lot of the other targest you hunt down are pretty bland. And, of course, the ending with the final target is a bit anti-climactic. But the big reveal afterwards was enough to grab my interest like it had years ago. It's pretty well-implemented, unexpected, and effective in shocking the player at the end of the game.You play as Ezio throughout five sandboxes across Italy: Florence, Tuscany, Forli, Monteriggioni, and Venice. I like that there's a lot of variety in the locations you visit, so the game doesn't become monotonous. When you travel across the country, it really feels like your traveling to brand new locations each completely different from the other places you've visited. However, there are plenty of loading screens whenever you want to travel and animations that mainly pestered me whenever I wanted to take care of some mundane, but it wasn't enough to completely frustrate me.The worlds, while well-designed, are a bit under-utilized. There's A LOT of stuff you can do, but I never felt that motivated to run around and collect little useless sh** thrown randomly across the city or complete mundane taks that are pretty much identical to all the other ones you've completed. In line with the theme of repetition, is the combat. I'm not a fan. You can't break an enemy's defese very easily but you can do the best damage through a counter... which means you have to wait for your opponent to attack you first... which means you'll be doing a lot of waiting in fights. And it's not like fighting is that difficult. Just tap the counter button. That's it.You know? That's probably the biggest flaw with Assassin's Creed II. It's too damn easy. This game was like scraping my knees on pavement when I first played it, but I think I've become a better gamer since then. At least, I'd like to think I have. And so many missions were so simple to figure out and finish in one try that I rushed through the majority of the game in about 15 hours (the other 5 hours was from all the running around in the cities I did). BUT since you're thinking about buying this copy of Assassin's Creed II, you're getting the Deluxe Edition! Woo! Mysterious! What does it mean?You get a couple hour-long memory sequences. Have fun.Okay, they're not that bad honestly. Originally, the game clipped them out as the penultimate chapters of the story and sold them as DLC, but since I played the Deluxe Edition it just skipped right to the DLC missions. I'm not a fan of removing story content for the purpose of making money but if you don't play these DLC packs you're not missing much. I'll give you a summary of both of them: Ezio loses the Apple. Then he gets the Apple back. It's not that inspired, obviously.While the Battle of Forli finally utilized Forli which you only were in for one f***ing mssion in the base game, you have a whole storyline behind Caterina Sforza (who, again, was only in that one out-of-place mission in the original game). A couple twin brothers kidnap her kids, and you have the save them to win the Battle of Forli. It just gives some excuse to pad out the story and add some open combat, which isn't the worst thing ever. I liked Caterina as a character, but the story itself wasn't that compelling.The Bonfire of the Vanities was my favorite chapter of the two. You need to get the Apple back from Savonarola, and to do so you have to assassinate his nine lieutenants across Florence, each with a different twist in how you go about assassinating them. I think Savonarola was a very compelling villain, who was prodded to do what he did because he honestly believe he was doing the right thing by spreading his faith in God to the masses. That and the missions are short enough to justify running around Florence one last time. It was pretty good.Assassin's Creed II isn't the best thing ever. It certainly hasn't aged well in its presentation. Cutscenes look pretty wonky. The characters, when up close, look like the characters from GTA IV. They look all shiny and fake, but their body and facial animations are actually really well-done. If you want this game to look better, either buy the Ezio Collection like the dirty console peasant you are, or just download some graphical mods. It's not terrible. The game hasn't aged that well.That being said, the atmosphere of the cities you explore are wonderful. Even though the graphics aren't that great up-close, they look marvelous when you're running around 1400's Italy, and listening to the chatter of passing pedestrians, hearing the howls of the local herald, and listening to the gorgeous soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. It's not the best soundtrack ever, but the main theme of this game and the ambient songs in Venice are some fantastic songs he wrote. This game still looks decent, but it sounds even better.Like I said, Assassin's Creed II is pretty damn good upon my second playthrough. I don't think if I ever reinstall this game, that I'll go around and do all asinine side-mission B.S. but I'm certainly inclined to play through the story again. It's a decent game, despite its flaws and one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I'm giving Assassin's Creed II a 7/10.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

""Oh no! Not another buggy, lame and boring Assassin's Creed""This is what most of us think when we see another game of this series.But beware!Assassin's Creed was not always a repetitive cash machine but actually had something like a soul. While Ubisoft tried something new with the first AC (ah, those times, when big publishers had nuts), it resulted in being a well-designed game with a great lore which also had its flaws like a kinda repetitive mission design. Well even Patrice Désilets (bare that name in mind), the godfather of AC, had to find the true heart of his project and so he did with the second instalment of the series:Assassin's Creed II plays during the Renaissance of the lovely Italy. You will visit the landscapes of the beautiful Toscana, enjoy a ride through the canals of Venice or take a walk through the charming Florence while you'll be full of respect for the masterworks of architecture. But Assassin's Creed II is more than a wonderful sightseeing tour but an intruding story about a young and very charming Italian Ezio Auditore Da Firenze who undergoes a drastic and lossy stroke of fate and yearns for justice, orientation and help. Eventually, he finds himself in a corrupted society full of intrigues and greed for power and is confronted by a man, who will later burn his name in the pages of history: Rodriguez Borgia. In all this chaos Ezio becomes recruited by the Assassins and will be entangled in the ongoing war between Assassins and Templars.This complex story and the wonderful sightseeing tour (which I can indulge in for hours although the graphic is by far not as beautiful as present games but still beautiful though) is completed by a wonderful soundtrack composed by Jesper Kyd who was so enthralled with the project, that the developers immediately let him do whatever he wanted.If you listen to interviews of Jesper Kyd or even more of Patrice Désilets, you will find exactly what you’ll feel in the game: they were emotionally involved. It was not about another cash-grab or a milestone for their career. It was their very own vision. I mean, look at Patrice Désilets commenting on Assassin’s Creed II[ https] and how he goes into all the details, how he even remembers the dialogue. And since he left during the preproduction of Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, this may be the last game with such an emotional touch. After this one, Assassin’s Creed had to become “huuuuge”. Which means stupid, uninspiring and sensationalistic and its heart got sick like a child you don’t care for anymore.So let's indulge in this wonderful gem, that's far from perfect but heartwarming as well as intriguing.

												Well this game is probably the best game in the AC series (personally though I prefer syndicate). It had a compelling backstory for our protagonist (No spoilers!). It featured many historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Niccolò Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza etc. The parkour is the best it’s even been. The melee combat is a bit just like mashing 2 toys together sometimes for my liking. Overall the best AC game!Tl: DRPros*Great parkour*Good story*Features famous people and their history*A really cool tomb system (basically like the new tomb raider games)Cons*Occasional bugs in combat*Made by Ubisoft (I’m hoping Watch Dogs 2 (When I get it) will redeem Ubisoft in my eyes)I’m giving it a….8.75/10 P.S If you are planning to start playing some of the AC series, start with AC2.

 TL:DR at the end, scored 7 / 10 as of 5th July 2016  Full Livestream Playthrough soon!  Borba Recommends Borba likes:Genre - Like its predecessor, Assassin’s Creed II is an open world action adventure, with elements of stealth and a great storyline, this time delving into the memories of a different character.Narrative - In this second major installment in the series, we follow the first of three chapters of Ezio Auditore da Firenze’s story. It contains memorable characters and events that easily surpass the first game’s plot. The present gameplay with Desmond Miles continues as well, and is more interactive and detailed than before, while shedding some light into the cliffhanger ending provided by the first game.Gameplay - Thankfully, there are some improvements for the game’s combat system, including the ability to disarm and take the opponent’s weapon, more assassination moves and a firearm. Navigation is improved with better parkour, and extended with swimming and rowing boats. New hiding methods and the added infamy system are also a fine addition, along with the possibility of purchasing and upgrading the main character’s headquarters to provide a steady flow of income, that may be used to purchase and upgrade equipment and clothing dyes.Interface - Remains simple and functional, with a few added features such as the infamy icon and the currency amount. The mini-map is also reworked, making it easier to read and allowing us to better perceive our surroundings.Graphics - Featuring improved scenery, characters and overall better texture and environment look, the game still looks decent, despite still having a somewhat bland colouring to it.Music - As expected, the music is brilliant and perfectly suited to game’s theme.Sound - Excellent voice work and overall sound effects, including more voice lines and sounds for generic characters than the last game.Borba dislikes:Replayability - Collectives and optional missions are a staple of the series, this time with the introduction of an economy that allows players to invest in shops and the character’s property to increase a periodic income. Currency is also used for upgrades and the purchase of consumables, which is a welcome addition. There are still no achievements, however, and these systems are filler content that will likely only please the completionists and explorers. After finishing the game, we may return to the world if we want to complete any challenge that was left unfinished or just stroll around.Design - Assassin’s Creed II has improved in almost every way, most noticeably in level design with more variation to the locations that are visited throughout the game. The last moments of the game, however, felt too easy and uninspiring, and the lack of challenge in the combat system doesn’t really help justify the grind for upgrades.Polish - There are some occurrences of stuttering due to poor optimization, and also some bugs with combat, horse riding and parkour that could be dismissed if this wasn’t a high production title.Borba feels like there are many improvements all over the board, and plenty of new mechanics and necessary changes from the first title in the series. Assassin’s Creed II is a solid title, and the first of a trilogy ( AC II, Brotherhood, Revelations ) that is considered by many the best story arc in the whole series. It is a highly regarded title in the series, especially if you follow up with the next two games in succession. 7 / 10  ",1184,337,30,186,132,5,190

												Assassin's Creed II is a major and in-depth step-up from the first game. The nonsensical hack-and-slash has given way to a faster, more controllable and ultimately deadlier combat style. The so called ""stealth"" missions of AC I where you could kill an entire army in the city square and then ""stealthily"" assassinate your target that was covering nearby have given way to a game style where, if you so choose, you can actually play as a stealthy assassin. Guards continue to be impressively stupid and short-sighted but their AI has been increased significantly and they act more reasonably and faster, adding a bit of extra realism. The blending feature, the game economy, the rebuilding of Monteriggioni, the purpose of having something other to do than just kill people all add to the depth of the game.Lastly - I will mention the story. A deep, gripping, emotional story of loss and tragedy, beautifully woven from two brothers contesting in rooftop races to the evolution of a master assassin. You feel like you are fighting for something, that you are connected to the game world and that you want to do anything in your power to keep your family safe and your enemies at bay.Cherries on top - better controls, side missions that are more manageable in size and do not distract from the game and an awesome rendition of major 15th century renaissance Italy cities.

												Assassin's Creed 2 was my favorite of the series. It introduced a dynamic, exciting new assassin in Ezio, the gameplay from the first game was much improved and the story was less repetitive. The game introduced a lot of new mechanics, such as money, building up your own Assassin base, bombs, hidden firearms, double blades, all kinds of things! It was a fresh new experience from the rinse and repeat gameplay of AC1.AC2's biggest flaw was its ending, which ended up being really dragged out and repetitive. AC2 also still suffered from the control issues from the first game with Ezio randomly jumping off of or getting stuck on various things while climbing or doing parkour. While these created some frustration they didn't take away from the overall game.If you are new to the AC franchise, I would recommend starting with AC2. Altair wasn't that great of a character and the gameplay of the first game was repetitive and boring. AC really begins to be its own unique game in AC2 and you start with a long, expansive story with Ezio spanning 3 games. This game provides hours of entertainment and lets you experience Renaissance Italy in a unique way.			",252,59,1,63,72,4,91

												U see now children before I had my eyes on the one and only Will Smith-Chan I always wished to be ravaged by a dashing Italian gentleman. It was always a dream of mine to have Ezio el' Detorre♥♥♥♥♥to assassinate me, but that I would be able to seduce the fine italian some other way. He would grab my hand in his and we would go to the Sisteenth Chapel. I would lay back staring at the works of the Great Michael Angelo whilst he whispers sweet nothings in my ear. Oh he would penetrate with his blades alright but not the way that he had once planned to. Overall 2/10 passable.			",186,22,0,28,13,2,17

												This is an amazing game. In many aspects it is better then the first Assassin's Creed.Pros:- Captivating story. Although you can sense a little bit of what might be coming, I was still amazed that they went full blast on that concept. - Not as repetitive as AC 1.- Great graphics, and environment in general. History lives and breaths in this game. From music, through architecture, details and famous and fabulous painting. Even weaponry of the era. - Eagle vision is useful!- Interesting characters. - Decent length of game play.Cons (not many):- Combat is very similar to one from the original game. Can feel clumsy a bit sometimes. - Although you have a wide variety of weapons to chose from, I hardly ever used throwing knives (unlike AC 1) or felt necessity to use short blade (unlike AC 1 again).- From time to time you might get irritated when camera's twists and turns mess up your jumping or other acrobatics. - Although far less bugs happened, I've captivated pretty hilarious one. In Venice you may encounter legions of guards on one tiny bit of rooftop. Out of the sudden. They just HAPPENED there. The more you killed trying to clear out the area, the more would pop up in their sted. Creepy. Apart from that, the game is one of the rarer kinds when you have a blast playing and can learn some history. This is of great value as well, and AC series so far has been also educative. I know I'll be fishing for other titles of AC now. Yeah, I've heard the rumours about meh protagonist in AC III but... I must yet get disappointed by any game of the series. So far so good.Recommended! ",128,23,1,19,2,0,6

Get this game first before you buy Assassins Creed: Brotherhood, otherwise the story will not make much sense. Get Assassins Creed 2.			",60,5,0,5,5,0,5

												It's been a great many years since I've played this game. Much like Pajama Sam and Star Wars, I was very much obsessed with the Assassin's Creed franchise. Don't worry. I haven't turned into a murderous psychopath. Not yet at least.I played most of the Assassin's Creed games multiple times, but I haven't touched II since I first played it. I remember hating it purely for the graphics back in the day, but I'm happy to report that my taste in games has matured. Now let's REALLY find out what I didn't like about this game!To be honest, not a whole lot. Assassin's Creed II is well-justified in being called the best game in the franchise by fans and critics alike. And I mean that as sincerely as I can. It's a pretty enjoyable game.The story continues right off of the first Assassin's Creed (which I might go back and play a third time for sh**s and giggles soon), wherein you play as Desmond Miles as he accesses memories now of Italian ancestor from Renaissance: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Desmond's story is nearly inexistent, but where the real juice of the the story comes from is found in Ezio.See, Ezio isn't a stone-faced brooding Batman-wannabe like Altair and Connor Kenway were. He was presented like an young man who was thrown into unfortunate circumstances and had to dawn the cowl of the Assassin in order to fulfill his quest for revenge. Ezio is very charismatic and likeable, and you genuinely want to see him follow through with his revenge and become a Master Assassin. A lot of the other characters are pretty forgettable, but the game has so much charm and enough little jokes here and there that I felt entertained throughout the whole experience.Besides the other characters, I did get a little irritated with how one-dimensional the villains were. The only one that really got my interest was the bodyguard, Dante, and he's barely used in the whole game! I felt a bit of rivalry between Ezio and Uberto as well as Vieri, but a lot of the other targest you hunt down are pretty bland. And, of course, the ending with the final target is a bit anti-climactic. But the big reveal afterwards was enough to grab my interest like it had years ago. It's pretty well-implemented, unexpected, and effective in shocking the player at the end of the game.You play as Ezio throughout five sandboxes across Italy: Florence, Tuscany, Forli, Monteriggioni, and Venice. I like that there's a lot of variety in the locations you visit, so the game doesn't become monotonous. When you travel across the country, it really feels like your traveling to brand new locations each completely different from the other places you've visited. However, there are plenty of loading screens whenever you want to travel and animations that mainly pestered me whenever I wanted to take care of some mundane, but it wasn't enough to completely frustrate me.The worlds, while well-designed, are a bit under-utilized. There's A LOT of stuff you can do, but I never felt that motivated to run around and collect little useless sh** thrown randomly across the city or complete mundane taks that are pretty much identical to all the other ones you've completed. In line with the theme of repetition, is the combat. I'm not a fan. You can't break an enemy's defese very easily but you can do the best damage through a counter... which means you have to wait for your opponent to attack you first... which means you'll be doing a lot of waiting in fights. And it's not like fighting is that difficult. Just tap the counter button. That's it.You know? That's probably the biggest flaw with Assassin's Creed II. It's too damn easy. This game was like scraping my knees on pavement when I first played it, but I think I've become a better gamer since then. At least, I'd like to think I have. And so many missions were so simple to figure out and finish in one try that I rushed through the majority of the game in about 15 hours (the other 5 hours was from all the running around in the cities I did). BUT since you're thinking about buying this copy of Assassin's Creed II, you're getting the Deluxe Edition! Woo! Mysterious! What does it mean?You get a couple hour-long memory sequences. Have fun.Okay, they're not that bad honestly. Originally, the game clipped them out as the penultimate chapters of the story and sold them as DLC, but since I played the Deluxe Edition it just skipped right to the DLC missions. I'm not a fan of removing story content for the purpose of making money but if you don't play these DLC packs you're not missing much. I'll give you a summary of both of them: Ezio loses the Apple. Then he gets the Apple back. It's not that inspired, obviously.While the Battle of Forli finally utilized Forli which you only were in for one f***ing mssion in the base game, you have a whole storyline behind Caterina Sforza (who, again, was only in that one out-of-place mission in the original game). A couple twin brothers kidnap her kids, and you have the save them to win the Battle of Forli. It just gives some excuse to pad out the story and add some open combat, which isn't the worst thing ever. I liked Caterina as a character, but the story itself wasn't that compelling.The Bonfire of the Vanities was my favorite chapter of the two. You need to get the Apple back from Savonarola, and to do so you have to assassinate his nine lieutenants across Florence, each with a different twist in how you go about assassinating them. I think Savonarola was a very compelling villain, who was prodded to do what he did because he honestly believe he was doing the right thing by spreading his faith in God to the masses. That and the missions are short enough to justify running around Florence one last time. It was pretty good.Assassin's Creed II isn't the best thing ever. It certainly hasn't aged well in its presentation. Cutscenes look pretty wonky. The characters, when up close, look like the characters from GTA IV. They look all shiny and fake, but their body and facial animations are actually really well-done. If you want this game to look better, either buy the Ezio Collection like the dirty console peasant you are, or just download some graphical mods. It's not terrible. The game hasn't aged that well.That being said, the atmosphere of the cities you explore are wonderful. Even though the graphics aren't that great up-close, they look marvelous when you're running around 1400's Italy, and listening to the chatter of passing pedestrians, hearing the howls of the local herald, and listening to the gorgeous soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. It's not the best soundtrack ever, but the main theme of this game and the ambient songs in Venice are some fantastic songs he wrote. This game still looks decent, but it sounds even better.Like I said, Assassin's Creed II is pretty damn good upon my second playthrough. I don't think if I ever reinstall this game, that I'll go around and do all asinine side-mission B.S. but I'm certainly inclined to play through the story again. It's a decent game, despite its flaws and one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I'm giving Assassin's Creed II a 7/10.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												It’s a lot better game than AC1, but it’s still one of the 5 most frustrating games I’ve ever played. I’ve punched my desk and cursed like a sailor – Ezio tends to make stupid things occasionally, with tragic effect. 7/10 for me + beautiful cities full of activities+ plot of the game connected to history+ shops with armors, weapons and all kinds of stuff+ medicine to stock+ autosaves in the middle of the missions+ better control on protagonist than in AC1 – he’s not a block of wood now+ soundtrack in general+ you can run and kill all those stupid archers+ Ezio+ better free-running than in AC1…- …but still Ezio sometimes decides to do some idiotic things like jump all the way down when you’re in the middle of the platform sequence- this one ♥♥♥♥ing song (named The Vault) - I've rushed through most of the game, until I had to collect codex pages, then I stopped and decided to make all sidequests, viewpoints etc., my main quest at that moment was ""collect codex pages"" and I guess creators of the game connected that one song to this quest and I had to listen to THIS ♥♥♥♥ING SONG for 15 hours, over and over again, with little brakes- all Italians speaking English with some Italian words, it seems so false and unnatural that keeps you from feeling like this is more than just a stupid game (acctualy it just screams “I’m just a stupid game” all the time), ruins immersion- the whole animus idea- Desmond- no difficulty settings- stupid weapon change system (in villa)- “I just killed you, let’s have a long conversation”- can’t skip cutscenes (even when watched 2nd time and even when it comes to Villa cutscenes, like with Da Vinci)- frustrating fighting system (you can win all fights just by pressing X repeatedly)- you are taught about all these fighting techniques (counter-attack, dodge, disarm etc.) but when it comes to the battle and when 5 people attacks you in the same time, you have no chance of remembering about some stupid disarm- interacting with things while chasing people- posters of Ezio placed on towers, high buildings – who the hell looks there?!- hilarious cutscenes with paralyzed protagonist:1. execution of Auditore family – Ezio just stands there for 1 minute and does nothing, he would have made it on time to save them without a problem – I understand that this is a part of a plot, but it’s just made wrong2. templars attack on medici – vieri’s father slashes his targets, attacks Lorenzo and Ezio is completely paralyzed while standing 5m from him, unable to do anything, save anyone, assassinate Francesco de’ Pazzi ",155,45,1,37,5,3,15

												This is the first Assassin's Creed that I've played. I recommend this game, it's a good game with a very good story.I began with Asssassin's Creed 2 because before buying I toke a look at the forum of the game, and saw several reviews about  Assassin's Creed ""1"", and several people say the game is very good but with a lot of repeatitivy missions, and can be boring after some hours of gameplay. In the other side, I read good reviews about AC2, then I did a option to take Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood and Revelations, and with it get a game and two after with the same protagonist, Ezio. I bought the games during a steam sale, and thought good to take 3 games at same time with a good price.At this time when I write this review, I have finished AC2 and started Brotherhood yesterday.Well, it's an amazing game with amazing story, I really like the game and sure recommend it.Pros:* Amazing story, based on Italy near 1490, 1500. * Some historical persons like Leonardo da Vinci, Machiavel, and others.* Good mechanical of fights, with a variety of weapons, swords, and the hidden blade \m/* Good side missions, some timely chalenged, some stealth. I didn't get bored with them.* Several hours of gameplay.* The evolve of habilities in fight and parkour during the game.Cons:* The 3rd person view sometimes sucks. Sometimes the camera changes, you didn't view the back of your person, view by the side, the controls change too. Sometimes it sucks a lot to do right directional jumps, and sometimes when a jump is wrong you need to return and restart the mission from the beginning, very anoying. Fortunatelly this type of problems begin when you are at +-80% of the game.* Because last explained, some missions is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to finish. Imagine like you play for 5 or 6 hours just to finish a mission with 5 minutes of duration. And when you go youtube for help, you see other players saying the same: some anoying missions are really very, very anoying.* The mechanism of stealth in this game seems some broke. I had played Far Cry 3 some time before, I really like stealth way of play, and in Far Cry 3 the AI and stealth works very better.* The way the game shows controls during the game: the game don't show the keys (like E, shift, button 2, space), and instead shows icons related to the actions. Not a big problem, but take some time playing to fixing in mind these associations. I noticed it is better on Brotherhood that shows the keys instead of icons. A tip: I swap right mouse button with shift key, I think is better to run by holding the shift key (like in Battlefield, Call of Duty and other games) instead of holding mouse button.* Uplay DRM. It's not really a cons for me, fortunatelly I didn't get problem with uplay, but several people don't like uplay.			",164,14,29,4,8,1,2

												The best in the series. Assassin's Creed II takes the idea of the original and turns it into a very good game. There are a lot of ways to dispatch enemies. A lot of collectibles and great areas to explore. The graphical leap from 1 to 2 isn't gigantic, but it's the totally different, yet awesome atmosphere that makes this the definitive Assassin's Creed game. Did I mention the story is great? What I find great is that you're dealing with 2 stories at the same time; Ezio Auditore's story and Desmond Miles' story outside the Animus. A lot of people find these sections boring and un-interesting, but I find it the most intruiging part of the entire series.The game has a lot to offer and is thé must play of the AC-franchise.

												It's good. Running around is fun, etc. For a stealth game, there are very few stealth mechanics. I almost think it was easier to be stealthy in the first game. Controls are alright overall, but when they fail, they FAIL. Good story. Mediocre visuals. The first game looks better in many respects.Also, bad port alert. I'm running this on a GTX 970 and there were frequent FPS dips. Uplay is not as bad as it once was. It's still annoying that I have to use two clients to run the game, though.			",72,3,0,5,2,1,3

												Assassin's Creed II is an open-world Third Person Action/Stealth game that takes place in Renaissance Italy. You play as Ezio Auditore, an Italian noble, as he seeks to gain revenge on his enemies and further the causes of his faction, the Assassins. Much like the first game, gameplay is split between modern times where you play as Desmond (and not a whole lot happens), and historic times which is where the majority of gameplay takes place.The game is vastly superior to the first in the series, expanding on nearly every single area - collectables are still present but are not so meaningless, there's an economy of sorts, the missions are not as repetitive, and the combat has been opened up some. However, with the combat becoming more accessible, being stealthy/unnoticed is no longer as important - the game has taken a serious step in the direction of more action game than ""assassination,"" a trend which continues throughout the series (but which in many ways improves it for how most people would like to play).I played and beat this game on the 360, hence my play time, and I highly recommend it.Note: This game is excluded from Steam's Family Sharing service, and it requires the use of Ubisoft's Uplay program. If either of those bother you, then I would avoid this game.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												Sinking tons of time into this game. Absolutely amazing. Incredibly fun.EDIT: I would like to come back to this review and give an honest opinion on what I think about the game. I originally made the ""review"" above when I had only a few hours of game time.I'm going to say it right now, this is probably my favorite game in the series, or at least top two, as of August 9th, 2014.To start off, the story of Assassin's Creed 2 is above and beyond what I would have expected after playing the first game. It's not just a linear ""go kill this person and come back"" type of story this time around. There are genuine reasons for killing the people you kill, the cutscenes have many, many times more emotion than in the first game, and the voice acting is superb. In the first game, Altair's voice is monotone the whole way through. You could chalk this up to his serious personality, but if you have ever played games showcasing Altair later, such as in Revelations, you'll know this is not the case. It shows that Ubisoft really put many more hours of effort into making the story in Assassin's Creed II the best it could possibly be.Now, as far as content goes, the overall content in Assassin's Creed I can be smushed into 15 hours at max, and 8-9 hours if you just play the story. However, as you can see, I have 50+ hours in Assassin's Creed II as of the time this review is being written. I have replayed the game once now, but many hours were spent dicking around in the unique environment that is Renaissance Italy. There are endless possibilities for things to do in Assassin's Creed II, even after finishing the story. The best part is though, that even after finishing the game, I can start a new game and not be bored. That's the beauty of this game to me, and all of the Assassin's Creed games really.Overall, this game is worth the money twice over, and if you're thinking about buying it, you really should. I can honestly say that you'll have a hard time regretting it if you give it a chance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have mixed feelings really, so I am not sure where to start with this game. The beginning is probably the logical answer to that. Ok so, I have never played the first one. They all went on sale some time last year, and I got from AC2 to AC4 for like 23 British Pounds, it was great. Like an idiot, I forgot about the first Assassins Creed. This wasn't a problem until some smart ♥♥♥♥ from school told me they all follow a story which is intertwined in all of the games. By which time I had already got further in Assassins Creed Black Flag that any of its predecessors. As you can tell, I was off to a good start. That aside, I vowed to myself not to play ANY Assassins Creed games until I finished them in order, which is a pain because I hate the era of Assassin's Creed 2. Well, to the review I guess, I have rambled enough. I can't remember the dates, and I can't be bothered to look it up for the sake of the review. We can make it a little interactive review, look it up yourself :) (Here: https://www.google.co.uk/ ) Let's settle with 1400 and cabbage, that's a start. Assassin's Creed is set in an era before guns, which is enough for me, it put me right off. You play as an Assassin. His name is Ezio (Microsoft word thinks it’s Elliot), god alone knows how you actually spell that. Much like all other games in this franchise, you are taken on quite an interesting story to uncover mythical Assassin and Templar secrets from the forgotten past. It sounds really exciting doesn't it?I can't give this game a 'no' because the game itself is pretty good. I just don't like it. It is well made, and the graphics are horrible. I understand it's old, but they do make me cringe a bit. The accents on the speech are horrible, no offence to Italian people, you don't all sound that bad. The gameplay is like all other assassins creed games, where the missions are often rather over complicated and you have to parkour everywhere and lunge on people and kill them. They have everything they need, they ought to make a parkour simulator, really, it's a hidden talent. The story itself is quite repetitive, though it is good. There is a lot of 'kill a bunch of enemies and then do it again and again and again' and it gets BORING, but hey. 8/10. I cannot fault the game without being an idiot. It is a good game; I just don't like it. A lot of time went into it, and for its age it is quite impressive. I have to re-enforce though, that I hate that era.

												This game is a pain on Mac. From the default setting of 800x600 that makes launching the first time a headache, it also fails to recognise most keyboards on Yosemite (and, I've heard, many earlier versions of OSX.) Marketing this game as playable on Mac is infuriatingly obtuse and quite frankly inaccurate in the extreme. I'll continue searching for a fix for the keyboard issue but as of yet, I haven't managed to get past ""Desmond, we need to go!"" because I can't move.			",4,3,0,5,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic and I mean fantastic... for it's story.  The gameplay is redundant, sticky, glitchy as a pre alpha.  I haven't played the console version in awhile but from what I remember these glitches were mostly nonexistent.  Ubisoft seemed to accidently put the alpha on steam or something.  Not to mention to use a controler (which you pretty much have to considering the controls are about as good as playing it with a potato) are almost impossible to map out I had to download some sketchy .ini files of the internet just to get the game to work.  Ezio never seems to do what I tell him to do when I click buttons and the parkour never works I've found walking gets me places easier.  I'm a PC gamer and this is the only time I'd say go buy the console version. Worst PC port of all time.  Do not buy on PC unplayable.			",163,23,3,19,22,0,13

												I'm not usually one to complain about DRM or write reviews, but avoid paying for this game - no, all ubisoft games - because of the particular DRM system they use for activation.I changed my email address for the ""uplay service"" (which is a nightmare in itself, need to request via support and wait a few weeks for them to pull the thumb out) and after that the cd key will no longer activate when reinstalling the game as it claims to be registered to another email address. I'm pretty annoyed at their support who have not even contacted me back after several days waiting.Game itself is fine, get a torrent version instead of buying though and save yourself the headache of dealing with this kind of game-breaking DRM. It's one of those situations where the paying customer gets the worst available version of the product.Edit: Several YEARS later and still no response from ubisoft support. Worse still steam refuse to remove this game from my library - so even if I wanted to take it up the♥♥♥♥♥♥and pay for it a second time this isn't possible without creating a new steam account. What a joke, except I don't find it very funny since it's at my expense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This truly is a worthy successor to Altaïr's story. The environment, particularly the cities, are lively, there is a lot more to do, from objectives, to interaction, to managing an entire city. While the ""collecting this to achieve that"" is still there, the overall dynamic is increased a lot. References to the first game are made, and I would definitely suggest playing them in order.I think you can best compare this to the improvements made from GTA III over Vice City to San Andreas. Everything got bigger, more detailed, and more refined. It takes a little getting used to the new fighting style, and I could have done without the ""swoosh visuals"" of hack'n'slash games, but hey, the additions, including an enemy's health status, are worth it. You certainly don't have to complete every single ""grind"" quest anymore, although you most likely will anyway.Money plays a big role, because you can aquire upgrades and other items with it, bribe people etc. Citizens and guards react to your actions, and you, in return, have to take steps to make yourself less known. On top of that you will meet well known historical figures, even befriend them and enlist their help! If you liked the first Assassin's Creed, even a little bit, you will not be disappointed by this one!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am a player who loves a good story and this series has epic story to tell.Ezio was not really sympathetic to me in his early age, but his character was developed and shown troughout years. 20 years later he was totally different man.In terms of gameplay everything that I didn't like in previous game was fixed or improved. You have more options how to hide in crowd and draw guards away. Improved battle techniques, my favorite so far is disarming enemy and killing him with his own weapon.Edit: I almost forgot the swimming! ♥♥♥♥ yeah! No more dying from water... not mentioning how cool it looks when you jump from high altitude.And if you want to stay in this world a little longer, they added a ton of stuff to do except the main story! You can raid tombs for Altair armor, collect feathers all over the map for a cape that makes everyone want to kill you, or find strange glyphs and solve their puzzles to unlock a video that nobody understands!There is now also money aspect, you make money by completing memories, you upgrade your own town to make even more money and then you can buy upgrades, better weapons, refill knives, ...Only ONE thing that really bothered at the beginning: the controls are marked by some stupid icons that say nothing at all... everytime I had to look at settings what icon is what key until i got used to the controls...Totally recommending this game... and don't forget to play first AC as well to have the story complete.

												The main thing in this game is its scenario base: all major history events turn out an endless fight between assassins and templars for so called “Pieces of Eden”. Conspiracy, brutal violence, religious in its true shape, famous people in alternative reality — all runs through the entire game captivating till you see final credits. And, of course, it's all would be nothing without a good gameplay, where you run on the city roofs of Florence, Venice, Forli and Tuscany, killing guards with variety of weapons combining them. And yes — the game is freaking long.			",267,55,7,7,23,2,60

												An excellent game, it improved upon the best features of the first and got rid of most of it's failings. The storyline is very engaging (who doesn't like a conspiracy theory that spans millenia) and well told through cutscenes, flashbacks, items, and in game events. Combat is more varied than in the first one and took some practice to master, which is always good because it then feels like it takes skill rather than button mashing or simple 'timed clicking'. Again, the open world was excellent and climbing random buildings was great fun, though I did find at times that I couldn't go somewhere that I expected to be able to which was frustrating. The developers also threw in some more collectables and the ability to add items to a 'house', which seemed like just a gimmick at first, but was somewhat addictive when actually playing.Definitely going to play the other games in the series.

 Originally posted on January 3, 2011 Assassin's Creed II is a sequel that improves on it's predecessor in many ways. That being said, the game still does many things wrong. As a PC game, it is really frustrating for a variety of reasons.CONS:First, the UI is clearly not made for PC. It seems every multiplatform game these days has to use like size 24 font or the equivalent. I understand that consoles need this because people sit farther from the screen and the control input is imprecise, but PCs do not and the fact that developers don't make this very simple change to adjust the UI for the PC is really frustrating. Assassins Creed 2 is very bad about it. In the menu, you don't have a mouse cursor, instead you use directional keys to navigate, but the mouse's movement still swings your navigation wildly, which makes doing anything in AC2's menus really annoying and consolized.Second, the control interface is also heavily influenced by consoles, but not only is it clunky or unresponsive at times, but it actually misinterprets commands wildly in some situations. So much of what you do in the game is contextual (to compensate for a controllers' lack of buttons) that it is very annoying to use on PC, where people are used to one button generally meaning one thing. I found myself accidentally jumping backwards off buildings or not "" locking on"" to landing areas when free running, which gives the player a sense that he is not really in control. I have learned to anticipate this over time, but I wouldn't call what I have learned a useful gaming skill. The controls are really counter intuitive. For example, the spacebar, which combined with right click, allows you to sprint and freerun, also makes you jump, and since you are sprinting everywhere constantly in order to get places faster, this means you accidentally jump quite often.Another minor gripe is the use of a weapon wheel and no keyboard numbers for weapon selection. While the wheel is all good and well, nothing is quicker that pressing a single button and instantly bringing up the desired device. The lack of this and the lack of mouse scroll wheel controls is a clear mark of consolization.Finally, the controls tutorials are atrocious in this game, and the tooltips that pop up reminding you how to perform special actions are nearly useless. This is all for one reason. The controls are not labeled with their keyboard equivalents, but with symbols. This means that before the player learns that holding right click means going into high profile mode, the player must first learn what the games' silly ""fist"" symbol means by looking it up. Remembering exactly what these symbols and their combination do is an unnecessary hassle, and should have been gotten rid of altogether. They are however, labeled with colors, a reflection of controller buttons, and this is yet another piece of sloppy console porting.The Camera is another aspect of the game which is frustrating for PC users. While normally, it stays comfortably in position behind Ezio, like in any Third Person game, there are times (mostly in platforming sequences) where the camera flips around wildly, which can be really disorienting. This is designed to help people see what they are doing in platforming sequences. The problem is that for some reason, moving forward means moving in the direction the camera is pointing, not the direction Ezio is pointing. This means that if you are running along a beam and the camera suddenly switches angles, you will start moving in a completely different direction and probably fall off.One final consolization lies in the graphics engine. Like in assassin's creed 1, the shadows are still impressive, but the character models, poly count, texture quality, and draw distances are not. The engine is looking really dated, and as they open up the gameworld, it really starts to show. That being said, the game still looks really great, especially in motion and compared to other multiplats. It hasn't lost anything since AC!, but it also hasn't gained much either.My final gripe with the game is the plot and character development. The silly plot about ""genetic memory"" and a grand Templar conspiracy throughout all of human history has been expanded to include supernatural elements including aliens and ancient technology. I suppose it has gotten a little better now that Desmond finally does something, but it is still really goofy. The glyphs and their attached puzzles are mind numbingly awful in this regard. The Templar and the pieces of Eden were apparently behind every conspiracy theory since JFK and the Moon Landings. Next they'll bring in 9/11. It's just absurd. In addition, the characters are really underdeveloped and in places, hard to believe. Ezio's mother, a Florentine noblewoman in the 15th century, tells him crassly that he needs to find ""other outlets for his energies besides ♥♥♥♥♥♥s."" REALLY? I found that and many other lines delivered by characters to be absurdly out of place. Not just for the time, but for the believability of such characters as modern interpretations of the past. The delivery and scripting of many such encounters are really hard to believe. In addition, the Assassin techies in the present helping Desmond apparently miss the fact that connecting unknown bits of technology to your system and not protecting it will have consequences as well.Overall the game pushes the limits of reasonable suspension of disbelief well beyond their maximum.PROS:The being said, the game does many things right. Like in AC1, the actual atmosphere is great. You really do feel like you are walking the streets of 15th century Italia. The crowd dynamics, minor AI interactions, sounds and artwork all are great.The villa, fast travel, less generic missions, not dying in water, improved blending mechanics, and less generic collectible quests all make for a much better gameplay experience by fixing flaws from the first game. But I'm not going to praise these things too much because the 1st game was AWFUL in many of these regards. Fixing them is simply what should have happened, nothing more.I will say there is a lot to do here. The game is very fun, and it is a good buy for the $10 I got it for. Wouldn't have paid $20, however.Ultimately, if you liked Assassin's creed but wanted it to be fixed, that's exactly what you'll get with AC2. It's just still a sloppy console port with a really silly plot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PROS:+ awesome and long story+ cool mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge maps (five cities + extra areas)+ horse riding+ assassination missions+ smooth combat with impressive combos+ weapon selection including a gun mounted on the wristCONS:- uPlay- funky AI behavior from time to time- sometimes a bit repetitive guard fighting- occassional graphical glitches- not great video card optimization- audio can go out of sync in very rare occassionsComment:We leave Altair from the previous game to start a new adventure with Ezio. This game is a real upgrade from the first AC. The developers at Ubisoft listened to what people had to say about their first game in this franchise and created this unique and spectacular game! Basically all areas have been improved. AC2 take you for a ride with the really good (and rather long) storyline where Ezio evolves from a boy to a man ... and in the end to an ultimate assassin. The game is fun, it has lots of side missions and collectibles as well. Never have I found a dull moment in this game. The combat is smooth and apart from the generic guard fighting it is not at all repetitive. Main assassinations are great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. Again I also applaud the Desmond timeline although so many people do not like it I think it fits perfectly into the game. Of course there are drawbacks to this game. One being a sometimes funky AI for both allies and enemies. But the main flaw is in this case uPlay. This was the first game to implement it and back then it was a disaster. Today it is better but still far from good because starting the game on Steam just launches uPlay and THEN you can start your game. So you need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is fantastic and takes you on a journey through renaissance Italy where you will adore both the story and the visuals. I know I did. Recommended!			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Way better than AC1.  In fact, I can't really think of another sequel that improves more on the original than this one.  Whereas AC1 had you repeating the same types of missions over and over, AC2 has a huge variety of missions right up to the end.  Likewise, combat also has more variety with upgradeable armor, weapons, and home bases giving the gameplay a tiny bit more depth.  But perhaps best of all, while AC1's plot was silly, AC2's plot takes things to a level of complete insanity that is kind of charming in its own unintentionally absurd bat♥♥♥♥♥♥way.  I can't think of another game, for example, that let's you storm a medieval castle, beat up a pope, and (mild spoilers) hob-knob with alien beings all in the space of a few minutes and all with a completely straight face. It's pure, pulp-video-game, guilty pleasure, trash--but in a good way!  Mindless fun.			",214,85,2,68,14,0,27

												An excellent game, it improved upon the best features of the first and got rid of most of it's failings. The storyline is very engaging (who doesn't like a conspiracy theory that spans millenia) and well told through cutscenes, flashbacks, items, and in game events. Combat is more varied than in the first one and took some practice to master, which is always good because it then feels like it takes skill rather than button mashing or simple 'timed clicking'. Again, the open world was excellent and climbing random buildings was great fun, though I did find at times that I couldn't go somewhere that I expected to be able to which was frustrating. The developers also threw in some more collectables and the ability to add items to a 'house', which seemed like just a gimmick at first, but was somewhat addictive when actually playing.Definitely going to play the other games in the series.

 Originally posted on January 3, 2011 Assassin's Creed II is a sequel that improves on it's predecessor in many ways. That being said, the game still does many things wrong. As a PC game, it is really frustrating for a variety of reasons.CONS:First, the UI is clearly not made for PC. It seems every multiplatform game these days has to use like size 24 font or the equivalent. I understand that consoles need this because people sit farther from the screen and the control input is imprecise, but PCs do not and the fact that developers don't make this very simple change to adjust the UI for the PC is really frustrating. Assassins Creed 2 is very bad about it. In the menu, you don't have a mouse cursor, instead you use directional keys to navigate, but the mouse's movement still swings your navigation wildly, which makes doing anything in AC2's menus really annoying and consolized.Second, the control interface is also heavily influenced by consoles, but not only is it clunky or unresponsive at times, but it actually misinterprets commands wildly in some situations. So much of what you do in the game is contextual (to compensate for a controllers' lack of buttons) that it is very annoying to use on PC, where people are used to one button generally meaning one thing. I found myself accidentally jumping backwards off buildings or not "" locking on"" to landing areas when free running, which gives the player a sense that he is not really in control. I have learned to anticipate this over time, but I wouldn't call what I have learned a useful gaming skill. The controls are really counter intuitive. For example, the spacebar, which combined with right click, allows you to sprint and freerun, also makes you jump, and since you are sprinting everywhere constantly in order to get places faster, this means you accidentally jump quite often.Another minor gripe is the use of a weapon wheel and no keyboard numbers for weapon selection. While the wheel is all good and well, nothing is quicker that pressing a single button and instantly bringing up the desired device. The lack of this and the lack of mouse scroll wheel controls is a clear mark of consolization.Finally, the controls tutorials are atrocious in this game, and the tooltips that pop up reminding you how to perform special actions are nearly useless. This is all for one reason. The controls are not labeled with their keyboard equivalents, but with symbols. This means that before the player learns that holding right click means going into high profile mode, the player must first learn what the games' silly ""fist"" symbol means by looking it up. Remembering exactly what these symbols and their combination do is an unnecessary hassle, and should have been gotten rid of altogether. They are however, labeled with colors, a reflection of controller buttons, and this is yet another piece of sloppy console porting.The Camera is another aspect of the game which is frustrating for PC users. While normally, it stays comfortably in position behind Ezio, like in any Third Person game, there are times (mostly in platforming sequences) where the camera flips around wildly, which can be really disorienting. This is designed to help people see what they are doing in platforming sequences. The problem is that for some reason, moving forward means moving in the direction the camera is pointing, not the direction Ezio is pointing. This means that if you are running along a beam and the camera suddenly switches angles, you will start moving in a completely different direction and probably fall off.One final consolization lies in the graphics engine.

It's just still a sloppy console port with a really silly plot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It may have been because I just got out of an Art History class that made me get into the game even more. Since they used historical buildings, paintings, and people in this game.

												Don't let my low playtime fool you, I've played it through to 100% completion on PS3. Such a great game, a vast improvement on the first game; this is what Assassin's Creed should have been. The overall story and characters are much better, the game and progression is far less repetetive, and it runs smooth as silk on PC thanks to being a mostly-great port. (With admittedly few options to custumize graphics settings and not recognizing the triggers on my 360 controller as button inputs.)It's disappointing that Steam doesn't have the achievements built in, since they were satisfying to get and weren't ridiculous to try and achieve. It's also a pain that you have to use U-Play in addition to Steam, but at least once you get it set up and installed you don't really have to mess with it again.This is an easy game to recommend. There are some refinements and additions in Brotherhood and Revelations, but as a whole this is still my favorite entry in an excellent series.			",335,95,5,54,24,4,59

												An easy 9/10.So much more content, back story, character development and customization than the first game. One might fall in love with the persona of Ezio and how he matures to become an Assassin and parallely, whatever Desmond learns in the process. This game has taken the story forward marvellously amidst elements of unforgettable history. Set during the renaissance, Ezio has allies like Leonardo da Vinci and Niccholo Machiavelli, to name but a few. And his story is interspersed so finely with actual history that one might actually believe those events took place exactly like in the game. The connection with the first game, with Altair as well as Desmond, was made flawlessly. For the gameplay, the dynamics are much the same as in the first game, with some added moves, making combat slightly more realistic and more dynamic. The graphics look amazing. Florence, Venice and Forli look like their real counterparts. It's a really long to finish and I definitely don't have the patience to complete every mission from the sub-plot, particularly the one involving Subject 16. It's very tedious (and the reason for the 9, instead of the 10). But I'm sure patience would be rewarded because of the video waiting at the end of it. All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!			",56,10,0,3,1,0,0

												I can recommend this game despite the fact I had to spend fifteen minutes fighting Uplay just so it wouldn't crash, that's really great praise right there. But do not fear, oh reader, once you properly install it the game runs smoothly, at least it did for me.After the stunt with Uplay I was ready to growl, complain and call it quits, and yet this classic deserves all the praise it gets and once I started playing I couldn't stop.The controls on pc, with mouse and keyboard, were kinda weird at first for me. But then I started liking the sassy main character and learnt to jump from roof to roof without falling on top of innocent bystanders, and things improved. The story is compelling, Ezio is charismatic, the gameplay makes you feel like you can do parkour in real life. Even collectings things all over the cities wasn't boring because the landscapes and atmosphere are quite immersive.I loved it, and that's coming from someone who was ready to dismiss it because Uplay sucks and I'm quite skeptical of things that turn into long sagas. Now I feel like some of the ramdon NPCs, who stare at Ezio in wonder while he climbs a cathedral and mutter things like ""Santa Madre di Dio!"" or ""I should find a way to stay in shape too"". Yeah. Go buy it.			",34,29,0,11,2,1,3

												I don't think this game needs any introduction, and for those it does, here goes:You are  not yet playing this game? Shame. On. You. This is IMHO the best of the AC games. Playing through Ezio's life is like a ride in a rollercoaster, taking you from the start of his life to the end of it in the short movie called Embers (which you should look up, after you've played AC 2, and it's two followups, Brotherhood & Revelations.)I'd even recommend to play this game (and Brotherhood & Revelations) before the original AC game with Altaïr.Good Story, Rather good controls(bit shifty at the start, good after an hour or so.) While graphics are good, don't expect any high-def Realism. It's a good game even without excellent graphics.In Short:If you like free-range games, that still manage to keep you occupied or focused on several things to do, this is a good game for you.

												When this game was first released, I figured ubisoft had worked out the problems of its predecessor, assassin's creed. And if they had, this game would easily have racked up a very high score in my personal and otherwise uninteresting score book. Unfortunatley, assassin's creed II is much like the first title: there are a lot of good ideas, I mean A LOT of good ideas, but most of them are poorly implemented.If you haven't played assassin's creed before you played this game, you'll have less use for this review.Main CharacterEzio Auditore is a lot less ""oh look, stabbity stab stab, I'm an assassin"" than Altair was, and has a depth you can appreciate. At the start of the story, He's a stereotypical italian rich youngster, a womanizer and well... Sort of forgettable to be honest. But as you progress through the story, he matures and becomes more and more interesting.StoryThe story is still quite linear and predictable, following classic dramturgic structures. That's not to say it's bad, only that you can sort of catch what's going to happen and the plot twists are not twists as much as they are... Plot... Turns. Winks maybe? Desmond's story, the man whose memories you're exploring (but who in no way is the protagonist, funny enough), gets his own fleshed out story arch. You get to understand him more, and his relation with his co-workers. Still, in spite of predictability and linear story line, it is enjoyable and doesn't veer too much into the unbelievable. The story is probably assassin's creed II's main strength, because like most of ubisofts games, it suffers from poorly executed ideas.ControlsHere's where assassin's creed screws things up a bit. See Altair always felt like an assassin. He stabs his victim, then runs away and hides until the guards give up. That's what an assassin does. He doesn't have it in for the guards. They're just people trying to get paid to do a job. He's after specific targets, and fleeing after an assassination is almost always your very best method to avoid getting caught. Not so for Ezio. Your best bet with Ezio is almost always to stay and fight until everyone is dead. Ezio is a lot less assassinesque than Altair was, in spite of having a lot more tools at his disposal. I don't know why ubisoft chose to take the gameplay in that direction. Perhaps because it's fun (and looks quite impressive) with all the fight animations. I don't know, but through all of assassin's creed II, I never felt a very much like I'm an assassin. I always felt like rich-kid-given-assassins-tools. A fighter, who isn't an assassin by choice, but by necessity.Funny enough, that is actually reflected somewhat in Ezio's gear and story. He comments on it being nice to be able to fight up front and personal rather than having to sneak at one point, and as you gain upgrades, his armor more and more resembles plate armor. Perhaps saying that Ezio in this title isn't very much an assassin isn't too imprecise.In either case. You are introduced to a lot of different missions through the game, and that is a problem rather than something good. When I say it's a problem, I mean it's a problem when it comes to the controls. Especially on PC, the controls are not suited for the missions you are handed. You might have a mission to stalk someone, but fail because Ezio starts climbing a wall rather than run up to a corned. You might want to stab someone with a poison blade, but end up shoving them, or falling down instead. In some cases, you're supposed to chase your victim, but you might fail because Ezio decides to sit down on a bench instead of jumping unto a crate.The boon of assassin's creed, free running, is also the bane of the missions you are asked to perform. This is unfortunate, because those same controls is what allows you to think outside the box. The game often seems to suggest that you are supposed to think outside the box. But if you do think outside the box, deciding to use a throwing knife instead of backstabbing, or a gun instead of poison, you will quickley find that ubisoft wants you to get back in the box.Many events are scripted so that you cannot succeed before the game wants you to succeed, and those instances are frustrating for you as a player. They mean you are not rewarded for going outside of the old sneak-sneak-stab mode. You are not rewarded for trying to bypass guards to get to your target. You are not rewarded when you try to implement a plan to use the various tools at your disposal. Instead, you are being punished.But still. In spite of all this, assassin's creed comes recommended. The story about Ezio Auditore is easily the best story the assassin's creed franchise has to offer, and you'd be passing up something good if you decide not to wade through ubisofts well intended, but ultimately wonky gameplay.

												Here is what you will experience after buying the game.1) After you download and start the game, you will be rerouted and a Uplay client will be downloaded.2) You will be forced to register a Uplay account if you want to play.3) After you register the account, the Uplay client will crash. It will continue to do so everytime you start it.4) To solve this, you will need to Uninstall Uplay from your PC, restart and reinstall the latest Uplay client from the Ubisoft site.5) You will now be able to start AC2, and register the game.6) If you are using the Controller as recommended, you will soon realize the controls are messed up and you will have difficulty getting it to work.7) The only way I managed to get the controller to work was by downloading these files and putting them in the Ac2 directory.http://www.fileplanet.com/212510/210000/fileinfo/Wireless-Xbox360-fix-for-Assassin's-Creed-I-and-II8) Now you are ready to start the game.Playing this game requires you to go through the Uplay client even though you are using the Steam client. Starting it from Steam routes you to the Uplay client. You will need to register a Uplay account, which you will as you already paid for the game.I have not finished the game and so am not in a position to review the game itself. Just thought you should know this before purchasing any AC games on Steam.			",156,49,2,21,10,2,19

												I just started getting into the AC series not too long ago and so far this has been my favorite out of the three I have played thus far. The story is solid and the missions are fun as well as challenging. I will say that I did not like how the controls where portrayed since they do not show you what the binding is to the picture. However, after playing for awhile, you never needed to go back and look since you got used to it. I really enjoyed the game and the story kept me interested the entire time... and lets not mention you get to rumble with the pope something you won't get to do in any other game. If you love Adventure, a good story, and getting into trouble I recommend this to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AC2 is more of an interactive history lesson than just a game, optional as it may be. If the history interests you it's there in large amounts and you will likely learn a lot along the way. That aside the game is fluid and easy to enjoy. It's only downfall is that a Uplay account and a login is required, painful if you prefer single-player games and aren't always connected to the internet. I'd still give it 5 stars out of 5 especially for the price. Controller recommended but by no means required.			",237,41,5,20,17,3,34

												Assassin's Creed... some call it the CoD of open world games, some call it repetitive yearly crap and some call it The Best Game Evar!!1! Going to say this now, I like the franchise of Assassin's Creed, but not as much as I used too. I was a fanboy of the games, I admit. I thought every game in the series were the best things ever. But now I've become more ""wise"" with my games and such and I don't think they are the best games ever, but more a guilty pleasure.... Assassin's Creed II is a direct sequel of Assassin's Creed. It's a story driven open world game with some social stealth elements and lots of combat. As for the story (what AC is knowned for), AC II is good, an improvement over AC I. But like many other games, it felt rushed towards the end and has a ♥♥♥♥ing sequel bait (like we need more). It has interesting characters (not the best, but interesting) and one of the few games were I actually like the main character. Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian plumb--playboy, rich, cocky and charismatic lovable man. I love him and so do a lot of people. How does the gameplay hold up? Well it's an improvement over the first game, that is for sure. It follows the same logic, you're an Assassin, here's a contract, now go stab the guy. It is less repetitive than the first instalement. Now you have even more side quests to do, all kinda repetitive, but the Assassination Contracts are always a yes in my book for an Assassin's Creed game. The side quests are either go deliver mail (you are a banker that delivers stuff at the start of the game); beat up a man for cheating on his wife; assassinate a Templar (enemy of the Assassin) assossiate or you race someone across the map. The combat has become easier, now instead of waiting and countering everyone, you can wait, counter and shoot them! I swear, every installement of AC makes you have more and more weapons to use, it's too much for me. The game is really easy, a little too easy at points. You can purchase better weapons and armor in the game with money (trust me, you will have way too much cash), which makes the game easier. Is the world good? Yes, you have more places to go to than AC 1 and you go to Venezia, I love Italy and I want to give AC II a big kiss for placing this game there. The game did not age well compared to the other instalements. It still sort of look good to me, but it is poorly executed at times, it's laughable at points (i.e right after you get hidden blades, the scene makes me laugh every time how bad it is). The stealth in the game is different from the first game, and it's better. You can blend in crowds instead of praying everywhere you go. The more ""bad"" actions you do, the more the guards will notice you etc... Is it the best game in the series, I do not know. I don't know which one I prefer, Assassin's Creed II or Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. AC II is more an AC game, but I did spend over 600 hours into ACB on xbox... In the end, it's a really good game, I like it a lot. But it is not the ""best game ever"" I thought it was. Good story, good world, easy but fun combat and it has Ezio, can't argue on that. I give it a 8.5/10			",62,6,0,10,1,0,0

Ezio Auditore fighting the templars for vengance then turns into fighting to find answers as to what the templars are upto. The storyline and gameplay is really cool and fun to get into. It may have been because I just got out of an Art History class that made me get into the game even more. Since they used historical buildings, paintings, and people in this game. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes Action Adventure in anyway.			",510,96,17,75,24,5,53

												Don't let my low playtime fool you, I've played it through to 100% completion on PS3. Such a great game, a vast improvement on the first game; this is what Assassin's Creed should have been. The overall story and characters are much better, the game and progression is far less repetetive, and it runs smooth as silk on PC thanks to being a mostly-great port. (With admittedly few options to custumize graphics settings and not recognizing the triggers on my 360 controller as button inputs.)It's disappointing that Steam doesn't have the achievements built in, since they were satisfying to get and weren't ridiculous to try and achieve. It's also a pain that you have to use U-Play in addition to Steam, but at least once you get it set up and installed you don't really have to mess with it again.This is an easy game to recommend. There are some refinements and additions in Brotherhood and Revelations, but as a whole this is still my favorite entry in an excellent series.			",335,95,5,54,24,4,59

												ACII reprresents an improvement on the original Assassins Creed in almost every way.The game introduces us to Ezio, and his journey to discover his fathers murderer.  In the process of course he uncovers his true identity, and advances the story and plot that was introduced in the first game.  The story that revolves around the animus is also here, however its emphasis is greatly dimished from the first game.The elements that made the first game so fun are still here: Open world parkour, vast cities to explore, fun combat, mini games such as time trials and beat up events, overlook climbing, etc.  However adding to the mix are several new weapon types including a pistol, a customizable ""home base"" mini-city to generate wealth and keep your ""stuff"", upgradeable armor, paintings to collect and display, and the introduction of currency ""florins"" which you can loot from dead bodies or find in chests that are scattered about.  In short there is a LOT more to do than before, resulting in a more immersive experience.The character animations and sound design are both excellent.  Cut scenes are rendered in real time as before and character emotes and voice acting are superb.  I use the XBOX 360 controller since clearly the controls were designed with the console in mind.Graphically the game is an improvement over the original although at times the textures show their age during cutscenes.  A remastered version of this game would be fantastic.The level of historical content is huge, with additional info available from the abundance of database entries accessible at any time.  I actually learned a lot of things I did not know.3D Vision support is superb with the HelixMod update.Here are a few things I found a bit frustrating:1) Flaky controls at times, particularly during the ""lara croft"" style tomb raids.  Advanced parkour moves are typically not necessary for the rest of the game, so learning them during the tomb raids can be frustrating and require a great deal of precision.2) Checkpoint saves suck in general, and here there are moments where the checkpoints are too far apart, requiring you to replay quite a bit.3) The frame-rate will frequently drop, especially in cities.  I have a nice mid-range system (780gtx/i5-4850) so I should not be seeing drops in the frame rate, which strikes me as just poor PC optimization.Still despite some annoyances this game kept my attention through many, many hours. Overall heartily recommended.9/10 ",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												I just started getting into the AC series not too long ago and so far this has been my favorite out of the three I have played thus far. The story is solid and the missions are fun as well as challenging. I will say that I did not like how the controls where portrayed since they do not show you what the binding is to the picture. However, after playing for awhile, you never needed to go back and look since you got used to it. I really enjoyed the game and the story kept me interested the entire time... and lets not mention you get to rumble with the pope something you won't get to do in any other game. If you love Adventure, a good story, and getting into trouble I recommend this to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a fun game! The game play, character interactions, voice acting and the world settings are all top notch. You get to explore Italian cities, make friends with Leonardo Da Vinci and fight the Pope; Those things alone make the game worth playing. If you are getting this game, buy Brotherhood along with it. Brotherhood is just as fun and adds a few new things to the game that really make it worth playing. Revelations seems to be missing something that makes it not as fun but it is not a bad game and I would recommend it just to finish out this part of the series.			",53,6,0,15,0,0,3

												The seamlessness of the parkour and, to a lesser extent, combat flow (both from the first game) is revolutionary in its own way. The animation is plenty enough to get excited about, and parkour chase/escape scenes work especially well, letting you focus on where you want to go and the method of your escape, whilst the execution of jumps, turns and climbs is mostly automated. Turn off the minimap. Instead, bring up the full map when you get a new objective, then follow the streets, landmarks, and your sense of direction, to find the target, and your camera to search for guards. Make yourself be drawn into the beautiful recreations of beautiful cities, the colours, the changing atmospheres, the rich environmental soundscape enhancing with understated music, and you might just fall in love with this game.

												To the point:Positive:+ nice story with great historical elements+ particulary lovely music+ Italy is looking good, I like the architectural reference to the original buildings+ great mood+ very good performance (detail is ok, no game crashes)Negative:- controls and manovering is the most illogical I've ever seen- fighting system ditto- AI is preposterous- uPlay - all the way through is a piece of junk made by incompetent team (errors, update & patch problems, issues with account settings)- bonus Auditore tomb is not worth points whatsoever. Don't.Get.It.Ever. A waste of time and your nerves.- camera view is sometimes even more illogical than controls, especially during tomb explorations with timer- Faulty tip system - buttons are sometimes wrongly described and/or not mentioned at all. A great deal of controling during fight you must figure out by yourself.- horse running looks particulary hilarious (""Jolly Jumper mode on"") :P- ruffian groups to hire are idiots- wanted posters... hung on the height of the second or third floor, five metres above the street level...

												My favourite Assassin's Creed of the series so far. Ubisoft managed to take everything that was great from AC1 and fix everything that was bad. More variety in missions, good and charming story, excelent presentation, better combat, better climbing, stunningly beautiful cities and interesting characters. It's very hard to find cons in this game! I loved it, especially the soundtrack! Except maybe, final boss fight, its was a bit dissapointing, but nothing major. This game will entertain you for at least 24 hours just like the first one, but the content is much richer and there's tons to discover and side-quests to do.Gameplay 9/10Story 9/10Sound 10/10Graphics 9/10Polish 10/10-------------Overall 9/10 (outstanding game)			",215,22,9,21,16,2,25

												AC2 is more of an interactive history lesson than just a game, optional as it may be. If the history interests you it's there in large amounts and you will likely learn a lot along the way. That aside the game is fluid and easy to enjoy. It's only downfall is that a Uplay account and a login is required, painful if you prefer single-player games and aren't always connected to the internet. I'd still give it 5 stars out of 5 especially for the price. Controller recommended but by no means required.			",237,41,5,20,17,3,34

												A great follow-up to Assassin's Creed. Much to my personal joy and displeasure, this game is far less about stealth, and more about getting the job done. The wotry continues to captivate, as you watch Ezio Auditore, go from being a troubled making teenager, to an Adult looking to finish what his family had started. Combat is much smother, and social interaction is the key, from making allies to blending in with crowds, and avoiding the gain of noteriety. The DLC ads even more to the story, filling in what I felt like were plot gaps, that make the Templar seem like slackers, making the Delux edition well worth the extra cost.			",46,2,0,24,0,0,1

 Originally posted on January 3, 2011 Assassin's Creed II is a sequel that improves on it's predecessor in many ways. That being said, the game still does many things wrong. As a PC game, it is really frustrating for a variety of reasons.CONS:First, the UI is clearly not made for PC. It seems every multiplatform game these days has to use like size 24 font or the equivalent. I understand that consoles need this because people sit farther from the screen and the control input is imprecise, but PCs do not and the fact that developers don't make this very simple change to adjust the UI for the PC is really frustrating. Assassins Creed 2 is very bad about it. In the menu, you don't have a mouse cursor, instead you use directional keys to navigate, but the mouse's movement still swings your navigation wildly, which makes doing anything in AC2's menus really annoying and consolized.Second, the control interface is also heavily influenced by consoles, but not only is it clunky or unresponsive at times, but it actually misinterprets commands wildly in some situations. So much of what you do in the game is contextual (to compensate for a controllers' lack of buttons) that it is very annoying to use on PC, where people are used to one button generally meaning one thing. I found myself accidentally jumping backwards off buildings or not "" locking on"" to landing areas when free running, which gives the player a sense that he is not really in control. I have learned to anticipate this over time, but I wouldn't call what I have learned a useful gaming skill. The controls are really counter intuitive. For example, the spacebar, which combined with right click, allows you to sprint and freerun, also makes you jump, and since you are sprinting everywhere constantly in order to get places faster, this means you accidentally jump quite often.Another minor gripe is the use of a weapon wheel and no keyboard numbers for weapon selection. While the wheel is all good and well, nothing is quicker that pressing a single button and instantly bringing up the desired device. The lack of this and the lack of mouse scroll wheel controls is a clear mark of consolization.Finally, the controls tutorials are atrocious in this game, and the tooltips that pop up reminding you how to perform special actions are nearly useless. This is all for one reason. The controls are not labeled with their keyboard equivalents, but with symbols. This means that before the player learns that holding right click means going into high profile mode, the player must first learn what the games' silly ""fist"" symbol means by looking it up. Remembering exactly what these symbols and their combination do is an unnecessary hassle, and should have been gotten rid of altogether. They are however, labeled with colors, a reflection of controller buttons, and this is yet another piece of sloppy console porting.The Camera is another aspect of the game which is frustrating for PC users. While normally, it stays comfortably in position behind Ezio, like in any Third Person game, there are times (mostly in platforming sequences) where the camera flips around wildly, which can be really disorienting. This is designed to help people see what they are doing in platforming sequences. The problem is that for some reason, moving forward means moving in the direction the camera is pointing, not the direction Ezio is pointing. This means that if you are running along a beam and the camera suddenly switches angles, you will start moving in a completely different direction and probably fall off.One final consolization lies in the graphics engine. Like in assassin's creed 1, the shadows are still impressive, but the character models, poly count, texture quality, and draw distances are not. The engine is looking really dated, and as they open up the gameworld, it really starts to show. That being said, the game still looks really great, especially in motion and compared to other multiplats. It hasn't lost anything since AC!, but it also hasn't gained much either.My final gripe with the game is the plot and character development. The silly plot about ""genetic memory"" and a grand Templar conspiracy throughout all of human history has been expanded to include supernatural elements including aliens and ancient technology. I suppose it has gotten a little better now that Desmond finally does something, but it is still really goofy. The glyphs and their attached puzzles are mind numbingly awful in this regard. The Templar and the pieces of Eden were apparently behind every conspiracy theory since JFK and the Moon Landings. Next they'll bring in 9/11. It's just absurd. In addition, the characters are really underdeveloped and in places, hard to believe. Ezio's mother, a Florentine noblewoman in the 15th century, tells him crassly that he needs to find ""other outlets for his energies besides ♥♥♥♥♥♥s."" REALLY? I found that and many other lines delivered by characters to be absurdly out of place. Not just for the time, but for the believability of such characters as modern interpretations of the past. The delivery and scripting of many such encounters are really hard to believe. In addition, the Assassin techies in the present helping Desmond apparently miss the fact that connecting unknown bits of technology to your system and not protecting it will have consequences as well.Overall the game pushes the limits of reasonable suspension of disbelief well beyond their maximum.PROS:The being said, the game does many things right. Like in AC1, the actual atmosphere is great. You really do feel like you are walking the streets of 15th century Italia. The crowd dynamics, minor AI interactions, sounds and artwork all are great.The villa, fast travel, less generic missions, not dying in water, improved blending mechanics, and less generic collectible quests all make for a much better gameplay experience by fixing flaws from the first game. But I'm not going to praise these things too much because the 1st game was AWFUL in many of these regards. Fixing them is simply what should have happened, nothing more.I will say there is a lot to do here. The game is very fun, and it is a good buy for the $10 I got it for. Wouldn't have paid $20, however.Ultimately, if you liked Assassin's creed but wanted it to be fixed, that's exactly what you'll get with AC2. It's just still a sloppy console port with a really silly plot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do I recommend this game? Where is the 'Hell Yes' button?If you are new to the series, this is a great place to start. The controls will be taught to you in the early stages of the game very clearly, unlike some other games in the franchise which teach some things but expect you to know others already. This is also a great entry to the story of the series if you don't feel like playing through the first one. (this game is far superior to the original in pretty much every way.)I've owned this game for some years now and it was basically one of those games that were part of my backlog of games, most of which will never get played despite my intention to play them all. I'm sooo glad that I decided to play this game over some others in that backlog of mine. The game still is visually pleasing, not yet too 'retro' feeling (This review written in 2015). I was still in awe of many of the visuals. More importantly though, this game has great gameplay, a great story, great characters, great acting and animation. This is the real deal, a gamer's game. Stuffed so full of content, I didn't even do all the extra missions (not even close) and I spent 30 hours in this game enjoying every second. I really can't recommend the game enough. It starts slow and you might be bored for the first bit but trust me when I say that it gets GOOD and fairly quickly. I am now starting to play the next game in the series, Brotherhood, which picks up right where this left off in a very epic way. Make sure you sit at the start screen in these games for a minute or two before pressing start/enter to watch the opening cinematic. It won't play when you start a new game and the opening cinematics in these games are very good.			",126,14,2,7,6,0,32

												Assassin's Creed 2 was universally regarded as an improvement over the first game and I am of the same opinion. Gone are the same repetitive side quests at every turn. Instead we get a game more expansive and with more depth than its predecessor and a beautifully crafted medieval Italy to explore and experience. The protagonist, Ezio, is also an improvement over Altair feeling more like a protagonist rather than a puppet that the player guides through the game world. Assassin's Creed 2 is definitely one of the best titles in the series.			",285,124,4,44,27,4,28

												The start of a legend and stars one of the most likable characters in the franchise. This game puts you in the shoes of the young Florentine nobleman, Ezio Auditore. As an origin story for Ezio and the ongoing story for the meta-plot involving Desmond Miles, you uncover the plots unrecorded by history as Templars and Assassins continue to wage war against one another for the ultimate prize in both the past and the present.Whereas Assassin's Creed 1 introduced us to the idea of Templars vs Assassins; here it is fleshed out further with conspiracies and intrigue. Assassin's Creed 2 is also an interesting dive into historical Italy during the Renaissance. Very few games have pulled off a fully involved historical drama with attention to detail that this one does.I fully enjoyed Ezio's origin story and his journey of self-discovery. He is literally Renassiance Batman with a very similar revenge plot, but at the same time the plot twists and turns keep the ideas fresh and interesting.While graphically dated by today's standards, AC2 still stands the test of time. Combat mechanics are still very fluid and easy to pick up and play. If you enjoy alternative history or enjoy a good open world game, AC2 is definitely a good pick.			",238,34,0,48,4,0,26

												For me, Assassins Creed II stands as the peak of the entire series. It is a quantum leap from the clunky previous game, bringing all the immersive environments and great story telling, and combining it with a slick and fluid combat system.The plot is excellent, although it does lose pace somewhat in the later stages of the game as there are large time jumps, but the DLC goes go some way to remedy this. The free-running mechanics are simple and easy to use, and make you feel like an absolute master of the art within minutes. If I had one small complaint - less timed free running puzzles please? If you only ever play one game in the AC collection - make it this one.			",21,4,0,9,15,0,13

												This is still one of my favorite games. Everything works great together, the story, the parkour, the combat and graphics. I 100% ed the PS3 version and when this came up on deep discount, I bought it again with no regrets. Great entry point to the series, the original can be skipped entirely with nothing lost.

												Assassin's Creed II took what was flawed in the first installment in this series and corrected it, plus adding a ton of new content and a less monotonous gameplay. The story is probably still the most fascinating and awesome in the series, and so is the setting. I am italian, so seeing the historical sights of my country in this game is even better than it already would be for others. The main character is generally considered the most interesting protagonist in the series, and for a whole bunch of good reasons. The gameplay has its highs and lows: parkour is sometimes broken and combat is kinda boring and waaaaay too easy to put up a real challenge. And yet, this game manages to be a vast, varied, interesting, fun to play open world that has enstablished a very high standard for the series, a standard it did not always live up to. Brotherhood may be more refined, AC III may possess a (way) better graphic and technology, AC IV may have an overly awesome pirate setting with sailing and stuff, but this is still the episode that stays in my heart, and one of the last where the plot still made mostly sense. If you love this series but have only played the recent installments, buy this one ASAP.			",163,20,9,12,26,0,17

												One of the best Ubisoft Montreal creations, and indeed the best adventure game of all time on pc in my opinion. Has decent variety of activities, good plot, amazing characters. An overall win, despite mediocre graphics.It's really sad for me to watch once marvellous series to become so expensive, but soulless games, that come out faster  than cat gives birth. I wish one day Ubi will understand, that you don't need to produce games faster than light, to be succesful publisher and developer. Just look at the Rockstar North...			",143,21,1,16,3,1,8

												I had played the first Assassin's Creed on XBox and I  was very hesitant to be playing the second one on the pc, since every one said it was a bad port. I was pleasantly surprised. It controlled alright, there weren't as many bugs as I expected and I was able to play through the whole game without having and gamebreaking glitches.As far as the game goes, it is a massive improvement over the first one. Huge open world with lots of things to do. That being said, a lot of side quests do not serve any purpose other than being fetch quests. Yeah I can collect 100 feathers but why should I? There is no cool weapon or peice of armor at the end of it. At least the tomb missions give you a nice suit of armor at the end. The codex pages also allow you to learn some new skills, as well as being necessary for finishing the game. But the feathers, templar tombs, truth scans, and picture and treasure collection is just to make your villa look better.I am also getting tired of the climb a high place to reveal map thing that Ubisoft games keep doing, even though AC are the first few games to do so.If you are looking to play a nice long adventure game that has the feel of tomb raider and prince of persia then I highly recommend this game.

												The game itself is really awesome, but getting it to work with UPlay took me at least two hours of searching on the Internet and playing around with the UPlay installer. Also, it is difficult to play on the keyboard. It took me awhile to get the feel for the settings. I bought this game on sale because I never played any games in the series and I heard this was the best one. I am very interested in Renaissance Italy, and I found it fun to just explore the different cities, especially Venice and Florence, which were sculpted with amazing accuracy for a game made in 2009. The story is quite compelling and it took me about 30 hours to beat, but most people take 20ish. If you really want to play this game, I suggest buying it for a console or getting it on sale since it is a bit frustrating to play on a PC. 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin's Creed... some call it the CoD of open world games, some call it repetitive yearly crap and some call it The Best Game Evar!!1! Going to say this now, I like the franchise of Assassin's Creed, but not as much as I used too. I was a fanboy of the games, I admit. I thought every game in the series were the best things ever. But now I've become more ""wise"" with my games and such and I don't think they are the best games ever, but more a guilty pleasure.... Assassin's Creed II is a direct sequel of Assassin's Creed. It's a story driven open world game with some social stealth elements and lots of combat. As for the story (what AC is knowned for), AC II is good, an improvement over AC I. But like many other games, it felt rushed towards the end and has a ♥♥♥♥ing sequel bait (like we need more). It has interesting characters (not the best, but interesting) and one of the few games were I actually like the main character. Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian plumb--playboy, rich, cocky and charismatic lovable man. I love him and so do a lot of people. How does the gameplay hold up? Well it's an improvement over the first game, that is for sure. It follows the same logic, you're an Assassin, here's a contract, now go stab the guy. It is less repetitive than the first instalement. Now you have even more side quests to do, all kinda repetitive, but the Assassination Contracts are always a yes in my book for an Assassin's Creed game. The side quests are either go deliver mail (you are a banker that delivers stuff at the start of the game); beat up a man for cheating on his wife; assassinate a Templar (enemy of the Assassin) assossiate or you race someone across the map. The combat has become easier, now instead of waiting and countering everyone, you can wait, counter and shoot them! I swear, every installement of AC makes you have more and more weapons to use, it's too much for me. The game is really easy, a little too easy at points. You can purchase better weapons and armor in the game with money (trust me, you will have way too much cash), which makes the game easier. Is the world good? Yes, you have more places to go to than AC 1 and you go to Venezia, I love Italy and I want to give AC II a big kiss for placing this game there. The game did not age well compared to the other instalements. It still sort of look good to me, but it is poorly executed at times, it's laughable at points (i.e right after you get hidden blades, the scene makes me laugh every time how bad it is). The stealth in the game is different from the first game, and it's better. You can blend in crowds instead of praying everywhere you go. The more ""bad"" actions you do, the more the guards will notice you etc... Is it the best game in the series, I do not know. I don't know which one I prefer, Assassin's Creed II or Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. AC II is more an AC game, but I did spend over 600 hours into ACB on xbox... In the end, it's a really good game, I like it a lot. But it is not the ""best game ever"" I thought it was. Good story, good world, easy but fun combat and it has Ezio, can't argue on that. I give it a 8.5/10			",62,6,0,10,1,0,0

												The seamlessness of the parkour and, to a lesser extent, combat flow (both from the first game) is revolutionary in its own way. The animation is plenty enough to get excited about, and parkour chase/escape scenes work especially well, letting you focus on where you want to go and the method of your escape, whilst the execution of jumps, turns and climbs is mostly automated. Turn off the minimap. Instead, bring up the full map when you get a new objective, then follow the streets, landmarks, and your sense of direction, to find the target, and your camera to search for guards. Make yourself be drawn into the beautiful recreations of beautiful cities, the colours, the changing atmospheres, the rich environmental soundscape enhancing with understated music, and you might just fall in love with this game.

												What a fun game! The game play, character interactions, voice acting and the world settings are all top notch. You get to explore Italian cities, make friends with Leonardo Da Vinci and fight the Pope; Those things alone make the game worth playing. If you are getting this game, buy Brotherhood along with it. Brotherhood is just as fun and adds a few new things to the game that really make it worth playing. Revelations seems to be missing something that makes it not as fun but it is not a bad game and I would recommend it just to finish out this part of the series.			",53,6,0,15,0,0,3

												Probably the best Assassin's Creed game to date. It made huge leaps from its predecessor, in every area. The graphics are still very good, even though this game came out a few years ago; and as usual, music and voice acting is superb. The story is probably the best of all the other games in the franchise, simply because Ezio actually has friends and family around (other games depict him as more solemn person who works alone). It's very immersive, the crouds felt very real and the enviroments were lifelike. As always, combat is very fun (again, it probably beats the other games; the first was very hard while the rest are very easy). Buy this game now! It's very cheap on sale, and gives well over 20 hours of gameplay.			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												It was on sale and I deicded to finally play it because I was promised a realistic Venice (beyond that, I hate the main storyline of AC games that messes with history and portrays assassins as good and templars as bad. I can never get over that). The good: - Better interface than Assassin's Creed 1. Better everything than in the 1st game.- Great atmosphere. Cities look great.- When it works, the acrobatic action is really fun.- There is enough stuff to do.The bad:- It is not open-ended when this kind of game clearly should be- You cannot replay an earlier part of the game. There is only one savegame!!!- Some of the acting is kind of lame, though most of it was ok.- Some faces look/animate pretty badly- It often forces the main storyline down your throat and won't let you get to the cool stuff if you don't go with it. Again, the game feels like it should be sandboxy and open-ended but it isn't really.- You are forced to install and use Uplay from Ubisoft to play the game. Uplay will glitch out and not let you play or mess up your savegame and is just generally annoying and forced and I will make a consious attempt not to use it anymore. - Obviously this is not entirely the game's fault but, for such a famous game, I am surprised to see almost no mods for it. Again, the surprise is in the fact that sandbox-type games like this one usually have good modding support.- When the parkour acrobatics system fails, it looks quite clumsy and annoying. The player has little control over the process as it simply involves holding 3 buttons together, so you can't get much better at it except by trying to turn your character better.- The controls and interface clearly show that it's a console port.So yes, there are many points that annoy me, but the game is still awesome.

												The best of the AC series imo. No other game had as great a story, and the nifty things you get to do with certain items and sequences make this game so much more fun than AC1.  At this point the money earning system hasn't been completely inundated with tasks like you will see in AC's 3 and 4, but actually serves a purpose in helping game play and earning 100% in items and gear.  Much love to this series, and to Ezio! ALso, no game has made me cry like this one, or squee as hard over wonderful mothers			",44,23,0,17,8,0,3

												I'm still getting through the franchise, but this one is a must. Ezio as a character is very well made and his story is quite touching. You will meet familiar characters from the History lessons, probably kill some of them and hell will you enjoy it! All italian cities in the game are very nicely rendered and are just beautiful to look at from Eagles (= synchronizing points, y'know, the big buildings you climb on, synchronize and then jump off? Yeah, these ones.) Truth be told, buildings tend to repeat themselves, but that's a minor complaint. So hop on that flying machine that Leonardo built and kill some people! You won't forget it!

												Assassin's Creed 2 further polishes what Assassin's Creed started. Removing the linear preparation and focusing more heavily on story helped meld this series away from a ""prep, stab, rinse, repeat"" to a much more enjoyable ""I'm doing this because I have to story."" Free-Running is improved, voice acting is superb, beating out the rigid acting of Altair.It is definitely a worthy successor that while doesn't change the formula up too much, still provides enough new to the table to justify it's price and the time commitment.

You got everything, charming characters you get to like or dislike, a really large challenging universe with a background which has its twists and way way to many collectibles.Completiontime about 25 hours with most side quests and challenges done.

												I am a extreme completionist. I've purchased all of the assassin's creed games up until black flag, and may I say I have never played a series that had a story so immersive that I feel compelled to activtly communicate it to my PC bretheren. This release in particular allows you to relive the memories of Ezio Auditore de Firenze, a boy, turned assassin by the death of his family. From the perspective of this assassin you learn the code of manhood, and the assassin's creed. The extreme pain of seeing death to being able to deliver it numbly. You see a boy broken; then reborn. His story ties the series into the future with Desmond, the past with Altair, and in his own time. It is argued that Altair is the best assassin, and by far he is but after literally living the life of Ezio, you feel as though part of his morality has been transfered to you... the player. Altair was a cold killer only bound to the creed by himself and a few friends where Ezio devotes his soul to revenge to the point of nearly quitting. What can I say, the bleeding effect didn't only alter Desmond.			",206,29,0,14,9,2,1

												Assassin's Creed 2 is one of the few true masterpieces of the video game medium.  Can you feel it? The hairs raising on the back of your neck? When was the last time a video game did that to you? Whether you're running over rooftops or solving mysterious puzzles, Assassin's Creed 2 never ceases to be interesting and fun. The conspiracy theory at the core of the plot is both fascinating and terrifying at the same time and serves to completely engross you in the game's story, characters and setting with a fantastic sense of wonderment and curiosity unlike any videogame you've ever played before.  A conspiracy theory involving the creation of man, his purpose, his nature and most importantly, his rulers. The game talks about the origin and evolution of religion, objective truth and how history can be shaped and molded into creating truths that better suit humanity's rulers. Important philosophical questions are raised and never truly answered because maybe they're not meant to and you're supposed to find your own meaning and purpose in the world. The game was designed to make you think and reflect on these things by yourself and I believe that makes Assassin's Creed 2 one of the best and most important games of our generation.  Buon viaggio!

												Second Assassin's creed game I'm playing and I loved it. (Altair is still my fave tho)Let's start for once with some flaws: THE ♥♥♥♥ING CONTROLS. Jesus. I played it on PC without any controller and I was about to ragequit more than once just because of this. It's really sad because the game is good but these little things break the fluidity of the game. Also, the speed runs with timers either in missions or looking for Altair's armor could have been so much fun if it wasn't for the contextual camera which also ♥♥♥♥ed me up so many times. (And seems like I'm not the only one.)As for the good points.. There's many of them:- There's a hugeeee difference when it comes to graphics compared with the first game. - The storyline is great and will probably still be for the next games with Ezio.- If you consider yourself being a completionist and doing all the extra.. the game can be pretty lonnggg. (I just played the main story with some extra and it's already 35hours of gameplay)Overall : Great (AC I still better [don't hit me plz, I know most people enjoyed Ezio by far compared to the other characters])!I'll be playing the next AC for sure (and hoping for some fixes about the controls)Buy it on sale if you want but it's worth its 10$ !I'd give it an 8/10!

Truly this is without a doubt the best assassin's creed game that has released or will release the story is honestly fantastic and the gameplay is some of the most enjoyable that I have ever experienced in an assassin's creed game or any other game.

												Second Assassin's creed game I'm playing and I loved it. (Altair is still my fave tho)Let's start for once with some flaws: THE ♥♥♥♥ING CONTROLS. Jesus. I played it on PC without any controller and I was about to ragequit more than once just because of this. It's really sad because the game is good but these little things break the fluidity of the game. Also, the speed runs with timers either in missions or looking for Altair's armor could have been so much fun if it wasn't for the contextual camera which also ♥♥♥♥ed me up so many times. (And seems like I'm not the only one.)As for the good points.. There's many of them:- There's a hugeeee difference when it comes to graphics compared with the first game. - The storyline is great and will probably still be for the next games with Ezio.- If you consider yourself being a completionist and doing all the extra.. the game can be pretty lonnggg. (I just played the main story with some extra and it's already 35hours of gameplay)Overall : Great (AC I still better [don't hit me plz, I know most people enjoyed Ezio by far compared to the other characters])!I'll be playing the next AC for sure (and hoping for some fixes about the controls)Buy it on sale if you want but it's worth its 10$ !I'd give it an 8/10!

												Good game. It is a console port to PC, and it is better if you have a controller, but not impossible to play if you don't. I used only keyboard and mouse. I give this game 9 out 10 stars, as it can be frustrating to play with keyboard and mouse. I also dislike that getting all the chests and all the assassinations didn't add anything to the game. I also dislike by mid to late game, money means nothing. I ended the game with over 700k. Despite all of that, highly recommend playing.			",104,16,1,19,10,1,37

												Great open-world RPG with a historical twist.The assassin's creed series is a firm favourite with the community and I am not going to be able to add anything here.  However for me it is another example of a user interface done right.  If you compare it with, for instance,  Mad Max its chalk and cheese.  Max has 2 keys for jump - one for sillly little jumps over small obstacles and another for big jumps which have to be designated with yellow paint so you know which key to press.  On assassin's creed you just jump and the game knows how high. You can just concentrate on being awesome.Fantastically enjoable game.  Please make more!			",72,5,1,7,1,0,2

												This game is the second part to play an assassin and fight against the templers. Assassin's Creed II is the start to the story of a beautiful character called Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The story is interesting and thrilling right from chapter 1 onwards. I like the free running and climbing of the game cause it feels dynamic which let me have alot of fun during missions or in the open world. The combat is nice which alot of cool finishing animations but it can be boring after some time.The grafics are really good and i still enjoy them in 2017. Also i really like the effects and cutscenes which made the game interesting and refreshing to play it over again.The only downsides are that you encounter bugs but they're mostly not annoying and the horse movement especially jumpings feels a bit clunky. The boring part of the story was the collecting of the codex pages cause its the same again and again. I still recommend this game since it was a blast to play and a great time and expirience.

												Assassin's Creed 2 is a story, well possibly one of the best stories in the AC world, about an Assassin named Ezio Auditore da Firenze. A man that's naturally born into the true form of the order. This story will keep you in suspense, hit you in the feelers, and make you smile at some real historical figures set in the AC world, including places. I will tell you that you can spend lots of hours on this game alone just with the side quests, treasure hunting, codexes, seals, so on. The world is beautiful graphically and the every single character is lovable. The replayability is high, I've completed this game once before on console and had to buy it for PC just to experience it again. I highly encourage gamers to give this title a try if they haven't yet.			",256,7,2,15,10,2,30

												Assassin's Creed 2 is a really well-made game just like its predecessor - AC1. Gripping story, insane death blows, and joys of jumping from roof top to roof top. However, the keyboard and mouse controls are awful. Unless you have a gamepad handy, I wouldn't recommend the grab.			",253,51,12,14,17,3,32

												I'm still getting through the franchise, but this one is a must. Ezio as a character is very well made and his story is quite touching. You will meet familiar characters from the History lessons, probably kill some of them and hell will you enjoy it! All italian cities in the game are very nicely rendered and are just beautiful to look at from Eagles (= synchronizing points, y'know, the big buildings you climb on, synchronize and then jump off? Yeah, these ones.) Truth be told, buildings tend to repeat themselves, but that's a minor complaint. So hop on that flying machine that Leonardo built and kill some people! You won't forget it!

												The start of the Ezio trilogy, considered as one of the best character to have such compelling background. Started of when he was only 17 years old and since then the beginning of him as an Assassin. It took me 46 hours just to complete this game. 2 Tries. And that's not even 100% completion. There is just so much in this world. The hidden secret and all of those things. Despite being a 5 year old game the replayability of this game is just amazing. The game start off at an amazing pace telling you what happen in the previous game quite well. I have never played Assassin's Creed, but I heard that this one is the Holy Piece in the Assassin's Series and boy I was not disappoint by it. Great game. For me here is the pros & cons :Pros :+ Great story.+ The story of Ezio from the age of 17 till he is around in his 40's.+ The game graphic still looks ""Ok"" for my eyes.+ Stabbing people in the back has never been so good.+ So many hidden secrets.+ Great replayability.+ Gameplay pretty fluid + Requiescat in PaceCons :- F***** UPLAY is sh***- Still some minor bug> For me this is an 8.5/10. Get the whole trilogy of Ezio if it's on sale. But be prepare for the sh*tty Uplay.			",110,8,4,16,18,0,16

												The best of the AC series imo. No other game had as great a story, and the nifty things you get to do with certain items and sequences make this game so much more fun than AC1.  At this point the money earning system hasn't been completely inundated with tasks like you will see in AC's 3 and 4, but actually serves a purpose in helping game play and earning 100% in items and gear.  Much love to this series, and to Ezio! ALso, no game has made me cry like this one, or squee as hard over wonderful mothers			",44,23,0,17,8,0,3

												Simply amazing, what a wonderful experience.Pros: - Parkour and fighting mechanics have been expanded extensively from the first- Wonderful story line digging deeper into the mystery of the Templars, Assassins and pieces of Eden- If you're a collector nut this has a ton of them to search high and low for- Wonderful visuals from the environment and it's people- Nods back to the first game- Great dialogue and soundtrackPersonal complaints/thoughts:- I didn't find Ezio the most interesting assassin to play as but as I played more of the story his development throughout the years as a harderened assassin by the end of the game gave him more importance taking upon the mantle of his father. I still prefer Altair to Ezio that being that he's already an established assassin who everyone knows about as an assassin but not his name (other than the people in the brotherhood). The one thing that put me off is everyone knew Ezio's name and who he was with his getup, there really was no point to him wearing the assassin's outfit other than paying dues to his father and family. Ezio felt like a very rookie assassin to me, it really bothered me that I felt 80% of the game I was just avenging his family's losses out of revenge and you were put though the learning process of Eden, Templars and the Assassin brotherhood.Bringing power back to the people and ridding each area of corruption had it's satisfaction on it's own and felt great knowing you made a difference to the areas you visited making Italy a better place again. It is a bit silly however you are given capes of recognition but simply climbing a rooftop is considered a crime? I understand if the guards attack you with the cape if you have killed a civilian or another guard but the cape itself is supposed to be an entitlement for your services to the city and it's people so why be targeted for climbing or accessing restricted areas?I don't like collecting coupious amounts of items for such little gain and this game has a ton of them, little more less than the first game but still a lot.I didn't particularly like having to read subtitles for half english and half Italian spoken dialogue, I do appreciate it added depth to cutscenes and learned some Italian here and there but I couldn't help but get lost a few times or spaced out. I thought in the first game all was translated to English when Desmond asked Lucy. Perhaps things have changed I guess.8/10. Not bothered to collect the other assassin's stone tablet things at this point in time, maybe after I finish AC 3 to access Altair's armor.			",145,10,1,19,6,0,13

												Salute, Claudia.This game is vastly superior to Assassin's Creed. The combat feels a lot better and the environments are much better. The mini-game of maintain the town feels rewarding, and the fetch quests to find feathers and things feel a lot better than finding Templar banners in AC1.My one complaint is that it's a stealth game about assassintions, but there are some scripted sequences where you always get caught and always have to fight or escape from large groups of guards. I would have preferred if the game rewarded stealth gameplay by allowing you to bypass combat.			",83,22,1,21,8,0,5

												A beautiful, immersive, and spectacular game that follows the adventures of a young but brave assassin named Ezio Auditore de Firenze.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!Plot: The plot is pretty complicated, but I'll give you the short version:Ezio becomes an assassin and tries to hunt down the people who ended his fathers and brothers lives.Gameplay:Gameplay is smooth and fluid. Graphics:Assassin's Creed 2 is almost 6 years old. However, the graphics still shine and look great!Controls:Controls are very annoying at first, but comfortable once you get used to them.Optimization: The game is capped at 59 fps. Well, at least for me it is. It's pretty well optimized and I've yet to see any frame rate dips.However, the terrible DRM known as Uplay makes a return, and it is pretty damn bad.SCORING:Positives: Great plot, gameplay, story, and easy controlsNegetives: Typical DRM that you would expect from Ubisoft.Overall: I would give this game a 8 out of 10, and I would recommend this to a friend.

I own 3 copies of assassin's creed 2 on ps3 xbox 360 and pc so if that doesn't tell you the game is great I have no idea what can. Do yourself a favor and purchase this game you won't regret it once			",147,15,0,13,5,0,3

												Probably the best Assassin's Creed game to date. It made huge leaps from its predecessor, in every area. The graphics are still very good, even though this game came out a few years ago; and as usual, music and voice acting is superb. The story is probably the best of all the other games in the franchise, simply because Ezio actually has friends and family around (other games depict him as more solemn person who works alone). It's very immersive, the crouds felt very real and the enviroments were lifelike. As always, combat is very fun (again, it probably beats the other games; the first was very hard while the rest are very easy). Buy this game now! It's very cheap on sale, and gives well over 20 hours of gameplay.			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												This game is the second part to play an assassin and fight against the templers. Assassin's Creed II is the start to the story of a beautiful character called Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The story is interesting and thrilling right from chapter 1 onwards. I like the free running and climbing of the game cause it feels dynamic which let me have alot of fun during missions or in the open world. The combat is nice which alot of cool finishing animations but it can be boring after some time.The grafics are really good and i still enjoy them in 2017. Also i really like the effects and cutscenes which made the game interesting and refreshing to play it over again.The only downsides are that you encounter bugs but they're mostly not annoying and the horse movement especially jumpings feels a bit clunky. The boring part of the story was the collecting of the codex pages cause its the same again and again. I still recommend this game since it was a blast to play and a great time and expirience.

												Great game. Compelling story. Very immersive. Step into the well equipped role of Ezio Auditore. Stalk the streets of Italy and end yoru prey. This game is a must play.That said, keep in mind that no game is Portal (read ""damn near perfect""). There are a few caveats that make this game annoying. First and foremost: UPlay. Even the retail version of this game is wrapped in Steam, then has a second layer of UPlay. You're efectively running two game platform clients that effectively do the same thing in order to play this game. The only difference is UPlay doesn't have a store. Second is the controls. It's clear that the game's primary SKU was a console system and the PC controls suffer for it as they did in the original. After a while, they become easier to use, however the occasional jumping off a building unintentionally, grabbing the wrong ledge, or jumping the wrong direction will happen all the way to the last level.I encountered a single progression break where one target kept standing back up after killing him and the other that was supposed to be there did not spawn. It was a simple matter of restarting the memory, so it wasn't a big deal. I also encountered a UI bug where the Windows working cursor was visible. This happened often when I accessed UPlay while in game. It's not a deal breaker, but it IS distracting.Even with these faults, the game is spectacular. It gradually introduces you to the tools used by Ezio while keeping you enthralled by the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story lost me a bit as the game went on though. If you’ve ever been to Italy you will recognize a lot of the landmarks in this game, which is super cool!			",142,14,0,9,7,0,25

												As I was finally able to play this game on a decent computer, I began to play it soonest possible. The story really succeeded to catch from the very beginning; starting out as a (somehow) normal guy with no weapons and later on obtaining more weapons as you play and collect Codex pages, with which you fight your way through several great cities, to finally defeat the Pope of Roma and thereby avenge the murder of your family. This game really has amused me with both graphics, voice acting (accents!), the beautiful areas, the atmosphere, and the gameplay - sure some missions were almost identical, but you also get to do a huge variety of different tasks such as attending a carnival.Almost nothing for me to put a finger on except a few rarely occouring glitches. The end is also amazing and full of beams and effects. To be honest I'd call this game truly epic.			",400,96,13,33,23,3,44

												This is how the first one should've been in the first place. The graphics are great (except for the faces maybe) and the gameplay is fun. There are more diverse missions this time around and you get to spend more time in the Animus instead of walking around in 'real life' with Desmond. Go get it if you like third persion action games, this one is a must (and after that play Brotherhood).[Rating: 90/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

The way they portray his life and the path he takes is truly a masterpiece and work of art. The personality and charm of Ezio is a hard one to top.Response to beating AC1 = SERIOUSLY?!!; Response to beating AC2 = OMGOGMGOMGOGSDJKDSKGJDJGHSDG WTF.

												It was a great storyline, with a good amount of history and rich character development. Just challenging enough without being excessively hard. Using the controversial timeline of Florence's history was ingenious on behalf of the writers. The ending was awesome and completely worth it. All in all a 10 out of 10 on my personal scale. Definitely a game I will remember for a long time to come. Can't wait for the third installment, AC 3 Revelations.			",266,106,6,50,19,3,59

												Well..... This game is fun despite it being old. I like the combat, story and it's open world(well I also like Da Vinci for some reason). I also like the weapons especially the hidden blade and the gun(weird there is a gun in the Renaissance). I like jumping of edges and doing the leap of faith. It's pretty much it, but I do recommend this. If you have money try this out(or other Assassin's Creed game).			",31,0,0,1,2,0,2

												Okay, to bw honest I bought this on accident thinking it was with the older Ezio. However, I cannot complain about this accident... infact, I'm thrilled that I accidently recieved this! The story is unbelieveably addictive, the time our protagonist is in is mind blowing, and the system is incredible!To be honest, I never enjoyed any side quests... but, the game makes me want to tackle anything that they throw at me!I mean, I can't be bias... but in my opinion I see nothing wrong with this game... well, except how we must download a silly launcher and must translate the buttons/moves... but this earned my 9.5/10! I would recommend this game if you are curious about Ezio and a great open parkour game			",60,5,0,9,6,0,3

GameplayIt shines in its fighting mechanics as well as climbing up huge Renaissance towers. You are able to play half of the missions stealthily, by hiding inside crowds or hay piles, though you cannot properly crouch, so sooner or later you will get spotted. There are all sorts of different guards patrolling the cities with different abilities, and morale.StoryThe story is probably the best in the Assassin's Creed series, with good characters and progression. You play as Ezio Auditore who is a young man turned assassin to seek revenge on his father's death in a betrayal. Your main enemies later become the Templars who have locked the Apple of Eden  under their watch. The apple possesses godlike powers which the Assassins seek to keep it away from falling into the wrong hands.GraphicsThe graphics are alright for 2010. The world design is pretty good too.PerformanceCan run on most systems.LongevityThe story lasts 20 hours, which is very good. Plus, you have some bonus quests like running challenges, building up your uncle's villa, etc.OverallA landmark game which fixes almost all the problems in AC 1.9 apples out of 10.

												If you ever wondered why Assassins Creed games seem to be astronomically popular despite being the same re-hashed content with a cling-thin story, it's becuase they're still riding on the good will of this game and the next two.Assassin's Creed used to be about mystique in the ""real world"" revealed through progression in the ""virtual world"", with a whole lot of face-stabbing thrown in the mix. Ezio as a main character was extremely engaging and relatable. I remember how much fan discussion there used to be about the historical relevance of the Pieces of Eden, and many a fan theory came about as to how they were responsible for things like Hitler's rise to power, Einstein and Edison's genius, etc. They just don't make Assassins Creed games like these anymore.

												Not nearly as good as I remember it to be. I remember when I bought this game when it first came out on the Playstation 3, the audio was crystal clear. In this, it's horribly compressed and sounds like the voices were recorded over the phone. This game also installs UPlay, and all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that goes with it.And when I went to play with my xbox controller, it didn't even recognize my triggers, and half the buttons were unmapped! In game, there are no prompts to tell you which button to press to do what. Only icons like head, attack hand, off hand, legs etc. It would have been much better if they actually which button to press like A,B,X,Y, or in the case of a KB&M, E,Shift,Space,LMB.

It is resovled when pirating the game but its main aim to stop pirating.Also it took me like half an hour to start this thing with first time set-up, load in UdontPLAY, (even worse if its not installed yet), 2 different permission accepts and a password enter, and then finding my UdontPLAY password/account.ALSO YOU CANT REPLAY MEMORIES!!!

												Where do I start... where do I.. o I know!This game is amazing!This is the first game that I have played (out of the Assassin's Creed series).At first it was hard to get into the story , but after 1-2 hours of playing the game , you get in to the story line.I wont spoil anything , but I will say some things about the story (like exposition and background).You are Desmond (the ""real life"" dude from the last game) , and this time you go back to Italy to the 15th century and playing as the person named ""Ezio"" who sucked into the assassin's world after something wrong happened cause of the templars.In the game there are some characters from the history (always better to learn something when you play a video game..).One of the only problems in the games is the ""Dont get detected"" missions , there are some gamers like me that will hate this missions when you fail 10 times... but it is ok if you are a stealth lover.Score section:GFX - 7/10   The GFX is good for the time the game was released , now it is a bit ""Old"" but looking fine.Voices - 9/10Gameplay - 8\10Storyline - 9/10Score : 8.25This is a great game, every one should play at least one game of the Assassin's Creed series.

												Not nearly as good as I remember it to be. I remember when I bought this game when it first came out on the Playstation 3, the audio was crystal clear. In this, it's horribly compressed and sounds like the voices were recorded over the phone. This game also installs UPlay, and all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that goes with it.And when I went to play with my xbox controller, it didn't even recognize my triggers, and half the buttons were unmapped! In game, there are no prompts to tell you which button to press to do what. Only icons like head, attack hand, off hand, legs etc. It would have been much better if they actually which button to press like A,B,X,Y, or in the case of a KB&M, E,Shift,Space,LMB.

												WARNING REQUIRES Uplay: How could I recommend a game that I bought pre-Uplay that now has been changed and requires the bug-ridden spyware called Uplay?Ubisoft is apparently not happy with the built in DRM Steam comes with so buyers must suffer through an additional install of Ubisoft's buggy and needless Uplay malware to launch this game. To label Uplay malware is not hyperbole as Ubisoft have been caught in the past sifting data from customers' computers without consent. Read about it here: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/07/30/ubisoft-respond-to-uplay-security-drama/ To be clear this game needlessly REQUIRES 2 Clients running (Uplay & Steam) everytime it is opened.As for the game itself it's a bit like a Kardashian - it holds your attention for about 5mins before you start to feel suicidal.Regardless of how much an Assassin's Creed game may entice you - until Ubisoft drops its Uplay requirement from its games on Steam - Steam users should not expose themselves to the risk of needless software that has a malicious past from a company that shows no respect for its customers. If you enjoy paying for bad experiences this game has it in spades.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Assassin’s Creed II is what the original Assassin’s Creed should have been. With the inner workings of an engine already in place and two years to work with, the developers were able to produce a game that proves the potential of the series. AC2 successfully builds on the formula that was established in the first game and manages to improve upon what worked and fix most of what didn’t. The story picks up where the original left off, with Desmond Miles (and some new allies) on the run from the Templars. But this time he’s going back into the Animus willingly to re-live the memories of another ancestor, an Assassin named Ezio Auditore, in order to brush up on the Assassin skills that he’ll need for the battle ahead. Ezio’s story takes place in 15th century Renaissance Italy, primarily in the cities of Florence, Forli, and Venice. The environments are, as usual, the most interesting element in the game. The sheer scope of the cities and all of the activity going on within is amazing. Just exploring the city, climbing buildings, etc is pretty fun in and of itself, but what you actually get to do in those cities is what elevates AC2 so far above its predecessor. The missions are no longer a series of boring identical tasks cranked out of some tedium factory. Instead, there is a huge variety of mission types and new game mechanics to go along with them. You now have the ability to blend into crowds at will, hire groups to assist you, and much more. Another welcome change is the addition of a “notoriety” system, where you gain notoriety by performing suspicious or illegal actions. Guards will typically only attack you on sight if your notoriety is high or if they see you doing something illegal. This is a huge and most welcome change from the first game, where you’d end up being attacked for the most ridiculous of things (you know... atrocities such as walking too fast). Combat is also improved from the first game. Although it’s still ultimately really easy, it remains fun due to the sheer variety of things you can do (there are lots of different weapons to try and a whole series of new techniques). In addition to the main quest, there is also a ton of other stuff to do. Dozens of optional side missions are available, as well as a series of levels that take place in unique environments that utilize the free-running and platforming elements of the game to great effect (think Prince of Persia style tombs). There is also a “home base” Villa area that you can spend time upgrading and exploring if you wish. Doing so awards you with income that can be used to buy further improvements, more weapons, paintings, etc. This can potentially add hours of playtime and is completely optional. Such is the scope of this game. Perhaps my favorite “extra” bit this game offers is a sub-quest dubbed ""The Truth"". Hidden throughout the environments are glyphs that grant access to a series of puzzles, that when solved, unlock tiny portions of a mysterious video (which, when fully decoded, truly expands the mythology underlying the whole series). What really makes all of these elements come together so well is the main character of Ezio. He is just a likeable guy and is fun to play as. It’s really as simple as that. All in all, it’s hard to ask much more from a sequel. While yes, there are still some flaws here and there, there was nothing that ruined the experience for me to any large degree. Maybe part of it is just how leaps-and-bounds better AC2 is than AC1 that it’s easy to be more forgiving of any blemishes. I suppose that could be it. But then again, it could just simply be that a good game is a good game... I’m inclined to think that’s probably the case here.Grade: A-Note: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												Another example of how a great game can be ruined by a terrible DRM system. Seriously Ubisoft is trying to prevent people from pirating their games with Uplay but all it does is encourages them to do so (since you actually CAN play the pirated versions, unlike the once you buy).

												While the games mechanics are a little dated, the game still offers a pretty good story. It runs a little long and can get a little repeative (you kill one or two main guys and move on the the next chapter). It's got some puzzle elements (that can be hella creepy). The climbing controls can make you wanna put your fist though a wall. But it's an older game now, so you can look past all those minor annoyances (also since they're approved upon in sequels). If you're looking to jump on the Assassin's Creed train, I'd suggest starting here. (The first game doesn't hold it's age well, I don't think.) ACII's got sealth but not in a super serious style, platforming and there's lots of stabbing. Oh and collectibles, lots of collectibles.			",110,17,1,10,2,0,17

												A classic and glorious game of Ubisoft, which is self-evident. Only one thing makes me feel complicated is the relation between Uplay and Steam. I am not willing to login two game platforms simultaneously. I sincerely expect Ubisoft to deal with such problem as soon as possible, thx!			",8,3,0,0,0,0,1

												Despite the fact that the controls are terrible in this game, I really enjoyed playing this game. The problem with the controls is that they never mention the key you need to press for a certain action. For example, they'll show a ""hand icon"" to steal money, and not the actual keyboard key to use for the action. So you have to go into the menu, to learn which key is bound to that icon. Its really annoying and had me waste a lot of time, trying to memorize all the keys.Overall the game is amazing. I really like the gameplay. This was the first AC game I played and it got me hooked to the franchise.7/10 (For bad controls. Although I think a controller would work perfectly for this game.)			",210,43,8,21,16,1,24

												Pros-Does not get boring can play for six hours straight!-Good Story-Smooth Parkour-No Bugs Or Glitches-Good Graphics even to 2014 standards-Good Story-Good Combat System- i got it for $7 on sale but even at $11 it is VERY WELL PRICEDCons- Instead of saying; ""Press Q"" The game will say ""Press []"" Which means you have to dig through 4 menus and look at the controls to see what button [] actually means but after 1-3 hours you get used to this-after a while you can't even take one step out side before being spotted by a billion guards-beggers- Controls take a long time to get used to  UP TO 1-3 HOURS!- uses U-Play and i had to reinstall U-Play TWICE for the game to workMost of the faults/cons are minor so i give this game a 9.5/10			",26,1,1,1,1,0,0

												While the games mechanics are a little dated, the game still offers a pretty good story. It runs a little long and can get a little repeative (you kill one or two main guys and move on the the next chapter). It's got some puzzle elements (that can be hella creepy). The climbing controls can make you wanna put your fist though a wall. But it's an older game now, so you can look past all those minor annoyances (also since they're approved upon in sequels). If you're looking to jump on the Assassin's Creed train, I'd suggest starting here. (The first game doesn't hold it's age well, I don't think.) ACII's got sealth but not in a super serious style, platforming and there's lots of stabbing. Oh and collectibles, lots of collectibles.			",110,17,1,10,2,0,17

												I'm not reviewing this game, because I haven't gotten to play it. I'm reviewing the Ubisoft launcher that you have to use to launch this game. Every time I try to play this game, it says ""Uplay stopped working"" and it shuts itself down. This is the single most broken piece of software I've had the mispleasure of using. What a waste of 20 dollars.			",53,17,0,5,3,0,3

												Assassin's Creed 2:Positives:+ Ability to climb almost anything - buildings, towers, balcony railings, crates..the environment has great interaction. The jumping is also well done.+ The combat animations are good, with several weapons you can use, such as swords, daggers, warhammers, hidden blades, throwing knives etc. You can perform some cool counter moves against enemies and special attacks as well. + A fairly interesting storyline, although it has its flaws. The plot continues from the original Assassin's Creed, where Desmond once again enters the Animus and this time takes control of Ezio, an assassin who is out for vengeance against those who killed his father and brothers, while also trying to discover the truth about who he is and what he must do.+ Set during the 15th Century across many cities in Italy, this game has a unique feel. Graphically it's not that great, but the colours are really nice and the towering, iconic buildings have lovely architecture, giving you the impression that you're really in a Renaissance era town.+ You can purchase new weapons and upgrades for your armour, along with treasure maps to locate hidden chests of loot, which encourages exploration. You can upgrade your own city and learn new fighting moves in combat training. Raid assassin tombs, clear out templar lairs or complete assassination contracts. There's so much to do. There's also numerous features in the game designed to assist players in avoiding guards or enemies, such as blending in with the crowd to reduce attention from authorities, or utilising places to hide, like haystacks and rooftop gardens. Negatives:- Clearly, the developers didn't quite understand how horrible their controls were in the initial Assassin's Creed for PC. As such, they decided to use the exact same formula here. Fortunately, it's not a total disaster. The tutorial is better this time and explains key usage much more thoroughly. Assassin's Creed 2 does a much better job of anticipating your actions and this results in free-flowing, natural movement, making the game enjoyable. The controls could still be simplified and significantly more efficient though. It is obvious this game was once again poorly ported from consoles and it's disappointing. - The graphics in this game could be improved.- While the movement system is fluent mostly, it falls apart when you want to move fast in combat and switch between targetting enemies. There's multiple keys involved here which are too complex to grasp in the small reaction time available.- Travelling between locations within a city can get tedious and boring. There's a lot of climbing, running and leaping in this game, which has its benefits and drawbacks. There's no fast travel option to accomodate players who don't wish to lug themselves across the city every single time.Overall Score 7.5/10Assassin's Creed 2 is a lot better than the first installment in the series. By no means is it fantastic or ground-breaking as many would have you believe, but a good action game nonetheless. Pick this up when it's on sale.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												Ha, I'm a bit late with this one. This is the first game in the AC series I've ever had, and with just about 5 hours of gameplay I'm enjoying it immensely. Graphics are very impressive considering it's a 2009 release, and doen't make my system struggle at all even though being a port. The historical effort put into this game shines through - Story outweighs other factors quite a lot. :)Only negative point is that the head, fists, leg etcetera symbols seem pointless, I'd much rather them be keyboard or mouse keys, as in quicktime events I just dont know which button it wants me to press. 4/5 overall review.

												This game's aged a bit, but it's still a stellar title. In ACII, everything from the first game is improved upon. I mean everything. The climbing, combat, music, etc ends up being miles beyond what ACI offered. Playing as Ezio Auditore, you'll explore Renaissance Italy on your personal quest to avenge your family, but there's much more to Ezio's character arc than just REVENGEANCE. ACII is quite long, it'll take you more than a few hours to complete, and that's if you don't bother with any of the side stuff. Of which there is a fair amount of. Combat is rather simple, but it's satisfying and visually entertaining. No real difficulty to it though. Brutes are a needed addition to the enemy combatants, but they really aren't very intimidating in comparison to how they need to be. The PC port works fine in my experience, though the Uplay client can be a bit frustrating.  ",401,74,9,40,21,3,40

												If you're a Mac user I would avoid purchasing this game.When trying to launch the game I got the message 'Unable to access the Internet. Please verify connection' . This was despite having a perfectly healthily connection. I did an online troubleshoot and found this to be a common issue for Steam Mac users but I was unable to find a solid solution. I tried to get a refund from Steam but was sent an  obviously automated response saying I was unable to receive one because my game play exceeded 2 hours. I submitted a new refund request stating that even though my profile displayed 5 hours  game play usage, in actual fact I had never been successful in even launching the game, let alone play it. At this point I tried to compromise with Steam by suggesting that money back into my wallet would be a suffice outcome for me.I received exactly the same automated message from Steam 2 days later stating I was unable to receive a refund because of over usage. At this point I gave up. I have to say I feel pretty cheated and won’t be singing Steam’s praises any time soon.			",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

Playing as Ezio Auditore, you'll explore Renaissance Italy on your personal quest to avenge your family, but there's much more to Ezio's character arc than just REVENGEANCE. ACII is quite long, it'll take you more than a few hours to complete, and that's if you don't bother with any of the side stuff. Of which there is a fair amount of. Combat is rather simple, but it's satisfying and visually entertaining. No real difficulty to it though. Brutes are a needed addition to the enemy combatants, but they really aren't very intimidating in comparison to how they need to be. The PC port works fine in my experience, though the Uplay client can be a bit frustrating.  ",401,74,9,40,21,3,40

												Ezio Auditore, the main character in this game is the most well-defined of the entire series. I miss him and his dumb ""Requiescat in pace"". He says it every time he takes a dude down and it's just too silly. I have this sinking feeling in my gut whenever I think of the guy. Is this love? Could it be? ",141,7,2,24,4,1,10

												I fell in love with this. But... Problems with Uplay installation and crashing... Come on, seriously? Guys, the way company delivers the game is one the best ways to leave a good or bad impression. You leave bad one. But thanks to Steam users and guides I got through that. And, actually, i work in IT so i'm kinda used to when things that have to work brilliantly don't work at all, and there always are people who already know what to do.If you want to try, get ready to fix some troubles with Uplay. Guides will help.Now ok, let us return to the game. Epic plot. Smart developed. Beautiful designed interfaces (even if there are some unnecessary confirmations: if i want to heal now, that means I want to heal now, there is no need to ask me if I'm sure or not).New breath to classical vengeance stories.Definentely yes.

												Despite the fact that the controls are terrible in this game, I really enjoyed playing this game. The problem with the controls is that they never mention the key you need to press for a certain action. For example, they'll show a ""hand icon"" to steal money, and not the actual keyboard key to use for the action. So you have to go into the menu, to learn which key is bound to that icon. Its really annoying and had me waste a lot of time, trying to memorize all the keys.Overall the game is amazing. I really like the gameplay. This was the first AC game I played and it got me hooked to the franchise.7/10 (For bad controls. Although I think a controller would work perfectly for this game.)			",210,43,8,21,16,1,24

												While the games mechanics are a little dated, the game still offers a pretty good story. It runs a little long and can get a little repeative (you kill one or two main guys and move on the the next chapter). It's got some puzzle elements (that can be hella creepy). The climbing controls can make you wanna put your fist though a wall. But it's an older game now, so you can look past all those minor annoyances (also since they're approved upon in sequels). If you're looking to jump on the Assassin's Creed train, I'd suggest starting here. (The first game doesn't hold it's age well, I don't think.) ACII's got sealth but not in a super serious style, platforming and there's lots of stabbing. Oh and collectibles, lots of collectibles.			",110,17,1,10,2,0,17

												Assassin's Creed 2. So this game came out just 2 years after AC1 and when this game came out... fans loved it, critics loved it... and even today it's known as the best AC game ever made. Is it? Story: So the story takes place from 1476 - 1499. It starts off with Ezio... being born? uhh... skip 17 years later and Ezio's father and brothers are killed by a family friend Uberto Alberti. Ezio, escaping the city of Firenze with his mother and sister, go to Monteriggioni and meet his Uncle Mario. Mario teaches Ezio to become an Assassin. Ezio, like Altair, has to kill a certain number of templars and along the way, he becomes wiser and learns more tricks. So along the way you meet people like Leonardo da Vinci, Paola, La Volpe, Sister Teodora, Antonio and Rosa and also Bartolomeo d'Alvanio. In the end, Rodrigo Borgia, leader of the Templar order, becomes Pope to obtain the staff of eden and eventually takes the apple of eden from Ezio. However, Ezio then takes back the apple and the staff and uses it to enter the vault where he then finds out about the future, which would be the end of the world. The story... like AC1 goes from being 1 thing to another thing entirely. AC1 went from being Altair just doing it because he wanted to rank back up to actually trying to find out the meaning of the creed, bringing peace in all things. Ezio goes from just wanting vengeance to wanting to bring freedom to Italy. Gameplay:Everything from AC1 is back, and you don't need weapons or items to do certain abilities, you just need to learn them through people like Mario or Rosa. Leonardo also uses Altair's codex pages to upgrade the hidden blade to have a poison blade and a hidden gun. The gun doesn't really work too well... but it was the 1st time doing this... also everything other game that had a gun was an actual gun. Not a small tube in your wrist. But the parkour is the same, tweaked slightly to be easier and better to control, stealth is way better this time and you don't need to worry about running around the entire city trying to lose the guards and you can finally swim in this game. Yay. You're also able to upgrade your life meter by obtaining better armour or having Leonardo decipher codex pages. Collectibles: I didn't talk about this in my AC1 review because I didn't really bother collecting anything. I don't think it does anything... I could be wrong. But in AC2, you need to collect 6 assassin seals to open a gate in Monteriggioni that will allow you to take Altair's armour. Unlike collecting feathers and codex pages... the seals are very fun to collect. You go through different assassin tombs and it feels a lot like something out of Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones. Codex pages... ehh, you need to kill a few guards and just loot it like you would with a dead body (in the game not real life). Feathers can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves. I want to have fun when collecting, assassin tombs are fun. Everything else isn't. Is Altair's armour worth it? ehh... it looks nice but it's no different to having the most powerful armour in the game along with Leonardo's life meter upgrade. I probably won't talk about how it was killing each target because in this game it's set out similarly... although there was 1 I really did enjoy. Leonardo's flying machine in Venice then killing Carlo Grimaldi was the best assassination mission in AC2. So is this really the best Assassin's Creed game? I personally don't think so. But I can see why people think it's great. The graphics are much better, much more colourful and vibrant this time and the soundtrack... oh that is the best thing in this game... and the story is far better in this game. It's also got 14 sequences. So if you're playing this for the first time... it'll take you a while to complete. For me, only around 20 hours to complete the story and 5 hours messing around doing nout.			",43,3,0,2,3,0,1

												You need uplay to play this game. After you download uplay it will keep constantly crashing. I couldn't play even a bit of it. I always wanted to play Assassin's Creed, but ubisoft made uplay that doesn't even work. Hopefully, I bought this game on sale when it was just €2.50. By buying this game, I made my biggest mistake ever. I shall never buy and play ubisoft games anymore.So to everyone, don't buy this game even if it's on the lowest price, ever because it won't work!			",30,0,0,3,0,0,0

The reason for this: UPLAY!!!!!!!. ""Uplay launcher has stopped working"". I'm sure the game is incredible. However, I give it this thumbs down and an endless number of more thumbs down because of Ubisoft's garbage Uplay partnership. This trend has got to be one of the most ridiculously pointless things that has ever happened to video gaming. Get it together, Ubisoft...			",50,2,6,8,0,0,9

												Honestly huge improvement over assassin creed 1, and the main character feels more human to where I can maybe connect with him. gameplay is much more smoother and better. If you were like me and quit AC1 half way through because of boring gameplay then this game will not disappoint! the atmosphere is much better and more real. Also note you prob have to configure Uplay for 3 hours before actually getting to play this xD, but its worth it for me, at least its awesome			",207,41,1,27,17,1,34

												Before you purchase this game, a word of warning. Be prepared to  possibly go through what I have gone throug, which is installing and updating uplay, activcating this game, and then not even be able to play it.Every time I try to launch this game whether through steam or Uplay, it attempts to launch and then hangs at a black screen indefinitely, and forces me to either sign out of windows or restart to gain control, because it wont even let me end the process once it hangs.Add to this the troubling occurence of Uplay disabling my sound driver forcing yet another restart, and you begin to see why I'm not recommending this game and it's DRM within a DRM issues, absolutely no developer support, and lackluster programming preventing it from even starting, and why you shouldnt even bother with this hassle.I have tried all the suggested fixes including refreshing Steam, verifying game integrity, witch-hunting all the uplay files after uninstalling and then installing the updated version, etc. Nothing has worked and so I have come to the logical conclusion that this game and Uplay in general is just broke, invasive, and doing things that it probably shouldnt be doing, similar to a root kit, or a security policy bypass.Save your money and give it to a company that deserves it. Better yet, do a Google search and see what I see, that this problem I've described is painfully common.			",190,12,1,23,4,0,1

												Phewwwww Just took a trip through Italy in the great Renaissance Times..... and it was fun! This game is a must play one of the best in the year and really took a turn in graphics. It had an amazing story following the first game with a new character named Etzio (I think i spelled that right). Still Desmond must fight in the present time to defeat the templars and go in ""baby"" to see his ancestors past secrets. Great game I wish I didn't waste as many time on the side missions, but hey i completed it and it was good. I would say all is good except one problem I hope they do fix is when you climb buildings and such that you kind of have a tendenacy to jump off when pressing the A buton. Ah well :D I hope you all play it too whoever reads this.			",540,114,10,37,48,5,71

												Assassin’s creed 2 is one of the best stealth games I have played within the last ~4 years. If you like action-stealth games you should play Assassins creed 2. If you hated the first Assassins Creed you really should play Assassins Creed 2. This game has done what the first assassin’s creed fail to do; polish combat, customization, and side content. The combat now feels way more believable because enemies actually simultaneously strike you, unlike the first one where they took turns. The variety of weapons and items available to use also increase the “fun” factor in this game. I feel like a ninja when I use my smoke bombs to evade my enemies. I feel like a modern assassin with my throwing knives, and I feel like bat man when I use my flying machine. Lots of content to be had, I’ve been playing for over 2 dozen hours, and still haven’t beaten this game to 100% completion yet. The historical realism in the storytelling also makes the game very believable. Good Game. BUY			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												If you still have not bought this game then I ask you WHY? This game takes the excellent ideas in the first one and makes them fun!!! Yea, what we've been waiting for. This is most people's favorite of the Assassin's Creed games. It introduced Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the by far most likeable protagonist (perhaps because he has a personality!) This was also the FIRST game with Ezio so he wasn't old hat yet. The new setting of renaissance Italy is great. The cities, like in the first game feel different (Florence is huge with large cathedrals and town squares and Venice is more cramped with canals), but unlike the first game the cities seem varied. One block in Florence looks different from another block in Florence. One of the bigger additions to the game was money (a staple in the series now.) Money is f*cking useless! I breezed through the whole game and bought nothing. Literally NOTHING. You can also use money to renovate your villa to gain more money, but this is boring as f*ck! Even though that sh*t's dumb, most of the new features are interesting. There are loads of new murdering gadgets and more missions than before. It has gone from 10 hours of tedium (and some fun) to like 30 hours of fun. *SPOILERS*Also, the final boss is the pope, so that's a plus if you're into channeling your papal anger.

												I fell in love with this. But... Problems with Uplay installation and crashing... Come on, seriously? Guys, the way company delivers the game is one the best ways to leave a good or bad impression. You leave bad one. But thanks to Steam users and guides I got through that. And, actually, i work in IT so i'm kinda used to when things that have to work brilliantly don't work at all, and there always are people who already know what to do.If you want to try, get ready to fix some troubles with Uplay. Guides will help.Now ok, let us return to the game. Epic plot. Smart developed. Beautiful designed interfaces (even if there are some unnecessary confirmations: if i want to heal now, that means I want to heal now, there is no need to ask me if I'm sure or not).New breath to classical vengeance stories.Definentely yes.

A big waste of time.2. For mac users, the keyboard does not work most of the time. This causes you to have to restart the game for at least 10 times before you are able to play the game.

												Assassin's Creed 2. So this game came out just 2 years after AC1 and when this game came out... fans loved it, critics loved it... and even today it's known as the best AC game ever made. Is it? Story: So the story takes place from 1476 - 1499. It starts off with Ezio... being born? uhh... skip 17 years later and Ezio's father and brothers are killed by a family friend Uberto Alberti. Ezio, escaping the city of Firenze with his mother and sister, go to Monteriggioni and meet his Uncle Mario. Mario teaches Ezio to become an Assassin. Ezio, like Altair, has to kill a certain number of templars and along the way, he becomes wiser and learns more tricks. So along the way you meet people like Leonardo da Vinci, Paola, La Volpe, Sister Teodora, Antonio and Rosa and also Bartolomeo d'Alvanio. In the end, Rodrigo Borgia, leader of the Templar order, becomes Pope to obtain the staff of eden and eventually takes the apple of eden from Ezio. However, Ezio then takes back the apple and the staff and uses it to enter the vault where he then finds out about the future, which would be the end of the world. The story... like AC1 goes from being 1 thing to another thing entirely. AC1 went from being Altair just doing it because he wanted to rank back up to actually trying to find out the meaning of the creed, bringing peace in all things. Ezio goes from just wanting vengeance to wanting to bring freedom to Italy. Gameplay:Everything from AC1 is back, and you don't need weapons or items to do certain abilities, you just need to learn them through people like Mario or Rosa. Leonardo also uses Altair's codex pages to upgrade the hidden blade to have a poison blade and a hidden gun. The gun doesn't really work too well... but it was the 1st time doing this... also everything other game that had a gun was an actual gun. Not a small tube in your wrist. But the parkour is the same, tweaked slightly to be easier and better to control, stealth is way better this time and you don't need to worry about running around the entire city trying to lose the guards and you can finally swim in this game. Yay. You're also able to upgrade your life meter by obtaining better armour or having Leonardo decipher codex pages. Collectibles: I didn't talk about this in my AC1 review because I didn't really bother collecting anything. I don't think it does anything... I could be wrong. But in AC2, you need to collect 6 assassin seals to open a gate in Monteriggioni that will allow you to take Altair's armour. Unlike collecting feathers and codex pages... the seals are very fun to collect. You go through different assassin tombs and it feels a lot like something out of Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones. Codex pages... ehh, you need to kill a few guards and just loot it like you would with a dead body (in the game not real life). Feathers can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves. I want to have fun when collecting, assassin tombs are fun. Everything else isn't. Is Altair's armour worth it? ehh... it looks nice but it's no different to having the most powerful armour in the game along with Leonardo's life meter upgrade. I probably won't talk about how it was killing each target because in this game it's set out similarly... although there was 1 I really did enjoy. Leonardo's flying machine in Venice then killing Carlo Grimaldi was the best assassination mission in AC2. So is this really the best Assassin's Creed game? I personally don't think so. But I can see why people think it's great. The graphics are much better, much more colourful and vibrant this time and the soundtrack... oh that is the best thing in this game... and the story is far better in this game. It's also got 14 sequences. So if you're playing this for the first time... it'll take you a while to complete. For me, only around 20 hours to complete the story and 5 hours messing around doing nout.			",43,3,0,2,3,0,1

												Phewwwww Just took a trip through Italy in the great Renaissance Times..... and it was fun! This game is a must play one of the best in the year and really took a turn in graphics. It had an amazing story following the first game with a new character named Etzio (I think i spelled that right). Still Desmond must fight in the present time to defeat the templars and go in ""baby"" to see his ancestors past secrets. Great game I wish I didn't waste as many time on the side missions, but hey i completed it and it was good. I would say all is good except one problem I hope they do fix is when you climb buildings and such that you kind of have a tendenacy to jump off when pressing the A buton. Ah well :D I hope you all play it too whoever reads this.			",540,114,10,37,48,5,71

												Maybe I'm missing something because this game has gotten really good reviews.  However I noticed the following problems early on:-you must hold three buttons simultaneously just to run.  Not one, not two, but three.  This is a cumbersome mechanic and I can't even tell you what the ""profile"" button does.- the main tutorial for the control keys consists of a one minute review of your character's birth.-at no point in the game does it actually say what key to press in the game to do something, sans the control mapping screen.  Instead, for just about everything, from attacking to exiting out of a game menu, there is an icon which corresponds to what the control key does.  So instead of telling you hit x or enter or whatever to do something it will tell you to hit the fist button or the legs button.  Wow, I use the legs button to kick and run?  The head button to taunt?  Very helpful, game designers!  I never would have guessed these things!  Talk about being lazy!-while scrambling up a wall, several times I could neither see the footholds and handholds, nor would my character figure out where they were.  This made climbing the wall frustrating and several times my character jumped to his death instead of moving forward.-you're pretty much thrust into the first few fights with little chance to adjust to the learning curve.

The story of this game, the art style, the movement. You feel immersed in the world of Assassins Creed when you play this. Assassins Creed was great but I felt more at home in a sense with this game.

A big waste of time.2. For mac users, the keyboard does not work most of the time. This causes you to have to restart the game for at least 10 times before you are able to play the game.

												Assassin's Creed 2. So this game came out just 2 years after AC1 and when this game came out... fans loved it, critics loved it... and even today it's known as the best AC game ever made. Is it? Story: So the story takes place from 1476 - 1499. It starts off with Ezio... being born? uhh... skip 17 years later and Ezio's father and brothers are killed by a family friend Uberto Alberti. Ezio, escaping the city of Firenze with his mother and sister, go to Monteriggioni and meet his Uncle Mario. Mario teaches Ezio to become an Assassin. Ezio, like Altair, has to kill a certain number of templars and along the way, he becomes wiser and learns more tricks. So along the way you meet people like Leonardo da Vinci, Paola, La Volpe, Sister Teodora, Antonio and Rosa and also Bartolomeo d'Alvanio. In the end, Rodrigo Borgia, leader of the Templar order, becomes Pope to obtain the staff of eden and eventually takes the apple of eden from Ezio. However, Ezio then takes back the apple and the staff and uses it to enter the vault where he then finds out about the future, which would be the end of the world. The story... like AC1 goes from being 1 thing to another thing entirely. AC1 went from being Altair just doing it because he wanted to rank back up to actually trying to find out the meaning of the creed, bringing peace in all things. Ezio goes from just wanting vengeance to wanting to bring freedom to Italy. Gameplay:Everything from AC1 is back, and you don't need weapons or items to do certain abilities, you just need to learn them through people like Mario or Rosa. Leonardo also uses Altair's codex pages to upgrade the hidden blade to have a poison blade and a hidden gun. The gun doesn't really work too well... but it was the 1st time doing this... also everything other game that had a gun was an actual gun. Not a small tube in your wrist. But the parkour is the same, tweaked slightly to be easier and better to control, stealth is way better this time and you don't need to worry about running around the entire city trying to lose the guards and you can finally swim in this game. Yay. You're also able to upgrade your life meter by obtaining better armour or having Leonardo decipher codex pages. Collectibles: I didn't talk about this in my AC1 review because I didn't really bother collecting anything. I don't think it does anything... I could be wrong. But in AC2, you need to collect 6 assassin seals to open a gate in Monteriggioni that will allow you to take Altair's armour. Unlike collecting feathers and codex pages... the seals are very fun to collect. You go through different assassin tombs and it feels a lot like something out of Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones. Codex pages... ehh, you need to kill a few guards and just loot it like you would with a dead body (in the game not real life). Feathers can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves. I want to have fun when collecting, assassin tombs are fun. Everything else isn't. Is Altair's armour worth it? ehh... it looks nice but it's no different to having the most powerful armour in the game along with Leonardo's life meter upgrade. I probably won't talk about how it was killing each target because in this game it's set out similarly... although there was 1 I really did enjoy. Leonardo's flying machine in Venice then killing Carlo Grimaldi was the best assassination mission in AC2. So is this really the best Assassin's Creed game? I personally don't think so. But I can see why people think it's great. The graphics are much better, much more colourful and vibrant this time and the soundtrack... oh that is the best thing in this game... and the story is far better in this game. It's also got 14 sequences. So if you're playing this for the first time... it'll take you a while to complete.

												                            Some Pros & cons:+Campaing is very long and good.- But some missions are repetive.+Protagonist is one of the best in AC.+Other characters are very fun and good too!+Assassin tomb missions.+Sneaking and assassinating guards is always fun!-Combat system is ridiculously easy when you master it.............................-spearmen and brutes are only little bit harder enemies.+Parkour on roofs is very fun.-But controls are not best in this game.+You can beat up Pope in final mission!+ALLAHU AKBAR!

												Play it for an hour or two and you'll have seen about 90% of what the game has to offer you besides the story itself. Which is terrible in its own right as well as being part two of a trilogy. Ish.The environments of renaissance Italy are very nice, but I don't think the AC2 team can take much of the credit for those as the more original environments, by comparison, are kind of dreary and unimaginative.

I tried to launch it just updated and then almost never tried to run. Then I tried re-installing which did absolutely nothing. I really would love to play this game but sadly it just doesnt work, and after looking at other people having similar problems they say the solutuion is to allow access with any antivirus which yet again did nothing. Also I thought I should say I use PC. I would love some help or advice if anyone could provide some.			",27,0,0,1,1,0,6

												Requires uplay DRM and launcher seperate to Steam.  Will be deleting it immediately and avoiding all future Ubisoft titles.  Will wait for it to come out on GOG one day.  Happily I got it at the sale price, so that cuts my loss.  If a car manufacturer started selling thier cars as normal, but with two locks on each door and two ignition barrels...then explained that the new 2nd lock didn't always work but that you could still sit in your car on your own and make Brrrrrrmmm noises, you would probably go to a different manufacturer.

												Most people consider this game THE BEST assassin's creed game ever, but personally I think it's really dated and arduous.Pros:-The maps are large, are well designed and represent florence ver well.-Looks very pretty, especially for a 2009 game.-Fun traversal and climbing/parkour. Can be fiddly at times though.Cons:-The protagonist Ezio in my opinion is really bland and boring.-The story is decent enough but is told through awfully voice acted cutscenes which you can't skip without mods.-Combat consists of button mashing until your ♥♥♥♥ing thumb falls off.-No controller support (unless your instal malware infested drivers).-Uplay...

												One of the best ACT games I've ever played. Actualy, for some reasons I never played AC series before and I bought AC 2 and AC 3 some days ago. Although it's a game 3 years ago but it's still beyond many many ACT games nowadays. Graphics is good, plot is long enough and attractive, combat process is fun, riddles are not very difficult to solve, and the exlporation process of assassin tombs reminds me of my  happy memory of Tomb Raider series. Besides these, AC 2 provides many side quests for you to complete, and gathering part (such as treasure boxes and feather, etc.) of the game is much less boring than many games because you can climb or jump beween buildings, which entertains me a lot.Althougn I haven't finished this game yet (85% completion), I can't wait to recommend this game for who haven't played it, and I'm looking forward to playing AC 3 after I finish 100% completion of this game, and if AC 3 can still give me the same or more fun, I won't hesitate to buy AC 4.

												With this game Ubisoft started to add more and more timewasters into the game. What's worse: they are also included in the main story. While some praise the variety of gameplay, I fee the game loses focus on what's important. I stopped playing this game for monts raging over a sequence of ""play our minigames"" tht didn't do anything to move along the story. One hour wasted working towards an invitation you will not recieve, so you just go there without one. Dreadful.			",747,400,16,132,70,7,136

												This is a great game unfortunately the Mac port is quite bad.  There are persistent issues with using an external keyboard (I have a Bluetooth connected one) such that half the time the game opens it does not detec the keyboard. The only solution appears to be quitting and relaunching the game. This is an issue that many onilne are facing as well (http://steamcommunity.com/app/33230/discussions/0/846943514122188546/ and http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/376703-Keyboard-problems-on-mac-and-other-problems-Forums).

												With this game Ubisoft started to add more and more timewasters into the game. What's worse: they are also included in the main story. While some praise the variety of gameplay, I fee the game loses focus on what's important. I stopped playing this game for monts raging over a sequence of ""play our minigames"" tht didn't do anything to move along the story. One hour wasted working towards an invitation you will not recieve, so you just go there without one. Dreadful.			",747,400,16,132,70,7,136

												Most people consider this game THE BEST assassin's creed game ever, but personally I think it's really dated and arduous.Pros:-The maps are large, are well designed and represent florence ver well.-Looks very pretty, especially for a 2009 game.-Fun traversal and climbing/parkour. Can be fiddly at times though.Cons:-The protagonist Ezio in my opinion is really bland and boring.-The story is decent enough but is told through awfully voice acted cutscenes which you can't skip without mods.-Combat consists of button mashing until your ♥♥♥♥ing thumb falls off.-No controller support (unless your instal malware infested drivers).-Uplay...

												One of the best ACT games I've ever played. Actualy, for some reasons I never played AC series before and I bought AC 2 and AC 3 some days ago. Although it's a game 3 years ago but it's still beyond many many ACT games nowadays. Graphics is good, plot is long enough and attractive, combat process is fun, riddles are not very difficult to solve, and the exlporation process of assassin tombs reminds me of my  happy memory of Tomb Raider series. Besides these, AC 2 provides many side quests for you to complete, and gathering part (such as treasure boxes and feather, etc.) of the game is much less boring than many games because you can climb or jump beween buildings, which entertains me a lot.Althougn I haven't finished this game yet (85% completion), I can't wait to recommend this game for who haven't played it, and I'm looking forward to playing AC 3 after I finish 100% completion of this game, and if AC 3 can still give me the same or more fun, I won't hesitate to buy AC 4.

												Disclaimer: I didn't finish this game.Pros-The good to this game is basically the story and presentation, it's what had kept me playing as long as I did. All the actual gameplay aspects are competent at best, but usually just bland. Cons-The combat is shallow, and brainlessly easy.-It uses Uplay which has caused several crashes and lost progress, adding to my lack of inspiration to finish the game.-It out stays its welcome. The combat, story and activities are not good enough to warrent it being this long.-The parkour system often makes you jump in strange directions, often to your death.-There are at least 50 towers to climb, needed to reveal the details of the map. They are all nearly the same, but further on in the game they become more annoying to climb because the set paths become more complex, making an already monotonous task more annoying and monotonous.

												I came to this series very late, and with much skepticism. I remember the first game being hyped endlessly, and what a subsequent critical let down it was. Still, I eventually bought the game on Steam, and it sat in my library for ages. A few months ago I decided it was time to blow off the cobwebs and dive into the franchise at last. It's true what you've heard about the first game - it's tedious, even with the PC additions. Still, it's the foundation for an incredible series, and I recommend plowing through just to experience the story fully, and from the start.Assassin's Creed 2 was a game changer. The moment you start it up, it feels different. The visuals, the gameplay, the music, the characters - everything is gripping from the beginning. I won't spoil anything, but the Ezio trilogy (ACII, Brotherhood, Revelations) has been one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences I've had from a video game - and with my lifetime of nerd cred, that is no small praise. From the ridiculously gorgeous score, to the endearing characters, and earnest, intriguing storyling, play this franchise - you'll thank yourself in the end.			",393,65,6,63,18,3,38

												Assassins Creed 1 was a great game but ended up being too repetitive and at times a little lackluster persay. AC2 Fixes these problems and has produced a much polished game. The story is more exciting and driven and the characters have good development. This is the best AC game to date and Black Flag does not compare to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The story, the characters, the feeling of living and breathing in Florence and Venice is just...unique. I recommend you all to put 20 hours of your life into this unforgettable experience which will surely stick with me for decades.			",179,21,5,29,33,1,44

												i would say it would be great if it actually worked, but ""worked"" is more a matter of opinion at this point. it used to function, but something happened somewhere along the line, and i kept getting a ""cannot connect to servers"" error from the ubisoft game launcher. i figured maybe the servers were down for maintenance or something, so i tried again today. it's wonderful sitting and watching the simple ""loading"" wheel spin endlessly for no apparent reason while the game launcher attempts to check for updates that don't actually exist. every attempt to reinstall the game has failed and left me back at the infinite ""checking for updates"" mini screen.prior to this, the controls of the game were... lacking. it should make sense that pressing a directional key towards the ladder i am attempting to climb would make ezio turn towards that ladder and climb it, but he seems to have an inexplicable fascination with doing a stupid, baby-level parkour jump exactly one foot off the ground on the walls next to ladders. he's also probably in serious need of therapy, since it appears he tends to fall into sudden bouts of chronic melodrama and throw himself from rooftops to his death. you would think that a year would be enough time to recover from the loss of family, but then he also dedicated his life to revenge and murder, so perhaps he had some sort of predisposition to poor mental health.

												♥♥♥♥♥In one mission I was supposed to assassinate this guy. I cleverly snuck around a horde of enemies, climbed up the tower the guy was in, and prepared to kill him. Then the game decided to ""desynchronise"" (kill) me because I didn't stand in the right map markers and do everything in the precise order the game wanted. That is, at its core, all this game is. You stand in quest markers in the order the game wants you to, and doing anything else means you're a failure for some reason.If my copy of this game came with a disc, I would calmly eject it and snap it. Not out of rage. It would be the most sensible, rational response. Games like this need to die.			",106,20,0,11,7,1,17

												I really, really. enjoyed this game.I mean honestly, as soon as I started it and began to parkour accross the roofs of Renaissance Florence I was already having a blast. Even if the graphics are a bit dated, they only show major wear with character models in cutscenes, and the huge cities are still breathtaking. The setting was the first thing to hook me.The game has a lot more going for it than just setting though. Compelling characters drive the narrative- Ezio is extremely likable, and even if Da Vinci's inclusion feels a bit shoehorned, it still makes fetch-quests way cooler when you're grabbing stuff for a Renaissance genius. The story itself, while not mindblowing, is not bad at all, and even with the elements of the absurd the attention to historical detail is way higher than one would expect from a company like Ubisoft. And, of course, the gameplay. Fighting is good, and can actually be challenging depending on what armor and weapons you use. The parkour, although not as good as Mirror's Edge or anything, is quite cool, and I found that I spent much more time running above the cities than through them. Assassinations and missions can be quite free form, and sometimes the most fun part is creating goals or challenges for yourself with them- attempting to remain undetected by any guards, using hidden blades when a pistol can be convenient, or perhaps just charging in and swinging your sword left and right to take out your opponent in a blaze of glory. The game also throws a number of side-excursions outside of sidequests your way by providing collectibles and a villa to renovate and improve, which if handled correctly will result in absurd amounts of cash and a sense of satisfaction with all you've accomplished. I ended the game with just about everything under my belt except for most of the feathers laying around the heights, and I enjoyed every minute of it.Any major problems? Don't go into this expecting an amazing STEALTH game. It's not Dishonored. Nor are the parkour the fighting the absolute best in their catagories. But it's the combination of all these elements blended together in a fascinating setting that sets this game apart. As for UPlay, it was annoying with the initial updates, but I didn't have any problems with it afterward.Definitely a yes for me.			",233,85,6,40,27,3,54

												Assassin's Creed II is a perfect example of how to make a sequel. There's definitely a good reason why this one is a fan favorite. The basic story is that Ezio Auditore is seeking vengeance and is trying to rid Italy of the Templars. He soon uncovers a bigger plot that will affect more than just Italy. Now, just like with every other Assassin's Creed game, this one takes place in a historic location and time period. This time, we dive into Italy during the period of rebirth, The Renaissance. Before I talk a little more about Italy, let's go talk about the combat. Now, if you've played Assassin's Creed, you'll know that the combat system in that one was pretty good, but they've definitely made improvements. Weapons, for starters, have definitely been given an upgrade. There's a multitude of weapons, like maces, hammers, swords, daggers, throwing knives, and even a wrist pistol! There are different tiers of certain weapons (Mainly swords) that have different stats. Some add more damage, while some are quicker. In my opinion, the sword is the way to go. It's kind of like Mario in Mario Kart, generally good all around at all of the stats. One very noticable difference from the first game is you know have TWO hidden blades. Two hidden blades allow you to stealthly take down enemies easier and faster! Now you can kill two guys with one go. The hidden blade mechanics have also been improved. You can jump off legdes to take down enemies, you can effectivally use them in fights (unlike in AC 1), and you can also ledge-shank guards. This simple change is one of the great improvements from the first game. Now, general combat has also changed. It's more brutal, gives you more freedom, and works really well. Also, more death animations have been added, to satisfy your bloodlust. If you remember just a little bit ago, I mentioned a 'wrist pistol'. What exactly does it do, you might be wondering. Well, it definitely kills people. The wrist pistol is a ranged weapon that you get later on in the game and is definitely not something you saw in AC 1. In terms of usefulness, it's pretty nice. It's definitely not something you'd use for being steathy, because it's loud as heck! It's great for clearing out those annoying rooftop archers though. Still on the subject of weapons, throwing knives are still in the game and they really haven't changed from AC 1. Some more weapons that have been added include a poison blade and a smoke bomb (Which is kind of a weapon, but it can't really hurt anyone xD). Alright, so what's the enemy AI like? Well, honestly, the combat is really easy in this game. There are a couple of difficult sections, but they're not that hard. The combat is still fun so, there's that. The AI isn't the brightest AI, but they're definitely not the stupidest. There are a few different enemy times, such as archers, your standard guard, armored dudes, and heavily armored dudes (Which can be a pain). Okay, so we've got all of the combat stuff out of the way, now let's move on to some more stuff. So, the game has a system known as 'notoriety', which is just the level of ablitiy the guards have for recognizing you. If you have high notoriety and a guard sees you, they'll go after you. If you have a lower level of it and stay around for too long, they'll probably go after you. In order to get rid of this, you have to remove wanted posters, bribe people spreading the word about, and sometimes even kill a fool. The system overall is pretty cool and works well. It can also make you more careful as what you do. Another great thing about this game is its level variety. It never really feels like you're doing the same thing! Sure, there are assassination missions where you're given a target and you've got to assassinate them but hey, you don't have to go around and collect intell like in AC 1. There are a couple of things you do a couple of times, but the levels are unique. Without spoiling anything, there's a level that takes place in a carnival, as well as a level where you fly a glider! Yet another great thing about this installment is the characters. The characters are very well-written and well voiced! You'll notice a few famous faces in your journey. The characters are very fun and you build a connection to them over time. Also, the main character, Ezio, is a really great character. He's not dull (*cough* Connor *cough*) and he, like the story, is very well-written. Also something to note is the music. The music is absolutely amazing and is probably my favorite soundtrack from any AC game (followed by Black Flags). We've basically covered everything here except for one thing...the map. Just like in real life, Italy is beautiful in the game. The graphics are pretty great for its time and the maps look great as well. The maps you'll travel through are pretty large and very diverse. You can travel through them by boat (Yes, you can actually swim in this one) or by horse. You can also fast travel back to each of the locations. I've personally never been to Italy, but I've seen pictures and it definitely looks accurate! Overall, this is probably the best game in the series! The characters are amazing, the music is great, the story is incredible, and the combat is so good!  If you haven't played this game, I HIGHLY recommend checking it out. I definitely recommend starting for the first game, but you'd probably be fine starting from this one too. (Also, just note that this game does use UPlay)			",126,15,1,4,5,0,2

												I really wanted to like AC2. Having heard great things about the series, I chose this as my starting point and was a bit disappointed.There are so many poor development choices here, and I'm really hoping they're addressed in other AC games because I'd like to try at least one more out. But here are my criticisms: 1) The game uses Uplay, which sorta sucks. I thankfully haven't had a lot of the issues some of the other reviews here have had with it, but I did run into issues on initial startup (some Uplay files deleted themselves and I needed to reinstall it, for example)2) Freerunning..while it's pretty awesome and can be at times fantastic, there have been a lot of situations where Ezio just did the stupidest♥♥♥♥♥♥and really frustated me. Trying to jump off a roof towards a hay stack and for some reason jumping two feet out onto the cold hard floor and dying. Trying to drop two feet onto a balcony to get a treasure chest and INSTEAD jumping 30 feet down into a haystack. Trying to catch someone on a rooftop and jumping slightly too far off to a side instead of onto a little foothop. You get the drift. In a game where you need to be swift and precise the precision just doesn't feel there quite a bit of the time...Not that often, but often enough that it gets frustrating. Along with that, the puzzles aren't even really puzzles, but more of a ""can you look around and then hold the freerunning button in the correct direction"". 3) Combat is atrocious. Foes are constantly blocking and sometimes counter you (which doesn't hurt you much, so there isn't really any reprecussion) so you have to whittle down their health tediously or just sit around waiting for them to attack so you can counter, which sometimes barely hurts them. Allies hit each other (had a quest character hurt another one 3/4 of her health). Stealth killing sometimes launches you off roofs when you just wanted to look cool..Also random posts get in the way when you drop in for stealth kills. Why wouldn't it just make me jump differently so the stealth kill worked? Who knows.4) You can't switch weapons or armor without going back to your main villa. This is stupid as hell. If I buy a weapon that is worse than my old one just so I have everything bought why do I automatically equip it and why do I have to go all the way to a transport station so I can get back to the main villa, go to the equipment room, and reequip my better weapon/armor? So stupid.Some of the dialogue is just laughable (you need outlets Ezio 'I have outlets' OTHER THAN ♥♥♥♥♥♥S haha lol) and the plot is a little contrived. I'd much rather just have the plot center around Ezio and not have the simulation aspects (also the decoded video segments are ridiculous looking and stupid in my opinion). Following people around for missions is boring. Money comes way too easy and you'll have more than you ever need after you start upgrading the villa. There's no sense of tension since you can heal yourself at any time.The game isn't all bad of course. There's still some fun to be had and there's plenty to do and collect. It just seems really pointless at times...there's enough playtime here that you'll 'probably' get your money's worth, there's just plenty of better things you could be doing or playing.

												I will not recommend this game because it is bad - because obviously it isn´t, in fact, it is by far the best game in the series and I loved when I got it some years go; I will not recommend this game because of Uplay, because you simply have to install Uplay in order to play it (it´s just that simple, guys...); I will not recommend this game because the controls might seem weird for mouse and keyboard.The reason I will not recommend this game it is because it has performance problems. For a game of 2010, me playing on a PC bought in late 2014, it is pathethic that I have to deal with imense stuttering over and over again. It does not the make unplayable, but it makes it boring having to deal with it every 10 seconds, or even less. Supposedly, you have to roll back your graphics card in order to fix it, but I would you do that, just to play 1 game??? And it appears this performance issues does not only occur in this game of the series...Ubisoft just throws the game on Steam, not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this issues. Shame on them!			",58,7,0,4,5,0,7

Posted: April 2
												Assassin's Creed II is a perfect example of how to make a sequel. There's definitely a good reason why this one is a fan favorite. The basic story is that Ezio Auditore is seeking vengeance and is trying to rid Italy of the Templars. He soon uncovers a bigger plot that will affect more than just Italy. Now, just like with every other Assassin's Creed game, this one takes place in a historic location and time period. This time, we dive into Italy during the period of rebirth, The Renaissance. Before I talk a little more about Italy, let's go talk about the combat. Now, if you've played Assassin's Creed, you'll know that the combat system in that one was pretty good, but they've definitely made improvements. Weapons, for starters, have definitely been given an upgrade. There's a multitude of weapons, like maces, hammers, swords, daggers, throwing knives, and even a wrist pistol! There are different tiers of certain weapons (Mainly swords) that have different stats. Some add more damage, while some are quicker. In my opinion, the sword is the way to go. It's kind of like Mario in Mario Kart, generally good all around at all of the stats. One very noticable difference from the first game is you know have TWO hidden blades. Two hidden blades allow you to stealthly take down enemies easier and faster! Now you can kill two guys with one go. The hidden blade mechanics have also been improved. You can jump off legdes to take down enemies, you can effectivally use them in fights (unlike in AC 1), and you can also ledge-shank guards. This simple change is one of the great improvements from the first game. Now, general combat has also changed. It's more brutal, gives you more freedom, and works really well. Also, more death animations have been added, to satisfy your bloodlust. If you remember just a little bit ago, I mentioned a 'wrist pistol'. What exactly does it do, you might be wondering. Well, it definitely kills people. The wrist pistol is a ranged weapon that you get later on in the game and is definitely not something you saw in AC 1. In terms of usefulness, it's pretty nice. It's definitely not something you'd use for being steathy, because it's loud as heck! It's great for clearing out those annoying rooftop archers though. Still on the subject of weapons, throwing knives are still in the game and they really haven't changed from AC 1. Some more weapons that have been added include a poison blade and a smoke bomb (Which is kind of a weapon, but it can't really hurt anyone xD). Alright, so what's the enemy AI like? Well, honestly, the combat is really easy in this game. There are a couple of difficult sections, but they're not that hard. The combat is still fun so, there's that. The AI isn't the brightest AI, but they're definitely not the stupidest. There are a few different enemy times, such as archers, your standard guard, armored dudes, and heavily armored dudes (Which can be a pain). Okay, so we've got all of the combat stuff out of the way, now let's move on to some more stuff. So, the game has a system known as 'notoriety', which is just the level of ablitiy the guards have for recognizing you. If you have high notoriety and a guard sees you, they'll go after you. If you have a lower level of it and stay around for too long, they'll probably go after you. In order to get rid of this, you have to remove wanted posters, bribe people spreading the word about, and sometimes even kill a fool. The system overall is pretty cool and works well. It can also make you more careful as what you do. Another great thing about this game is its level variety. It never really feels like you're doing the same thing! Sure, there are assassination missions where you're given a target and you've got to assassinate them but hey, you don't have to go around and collect intell like in AC 1. There are a couple of things you do a couple of times, but the levels are unique. Without spoiling anything, there's a level that takes place in a carnival, as well as a level where you fly a glider! Yet another great thing about this installment is the characters. The characters are very well-written and well voiced! You'll notice a few famous faces in your journey. The characters are very fun and you build a connection to them over time. Also, the main character, Ezio, is a really great character. He's not dull (*cough* Connor *cough*) and he, like the story, is very well-written. Also something to note is the music. The music is absolutely amazing and is probably my favorite soundtrack from any AC game (followed by Black Flags). We've basically covered everything here except for one thing...the map. Just like in real life, Italy is beautiful in the game. The graphics are pretty great for its time and the maps look great as well. The maps you'll travel through are pretty large and very diverse. You can travel through them by boat (Yes, you can actually swim in this one) or by horse. You can also fast travel back to each of the locations. I've personally never been to Italy, but I've seen pictures and it definitely looks accurate! Overall, this is probably the best game in the series! The characters are amazing, the music is great, the story is incredible, and the combat is so good!  If you haven't played this game, I HIGHLY recommend checking it out. I definitely recommend starting for the first game, but you'd probably be fine starting from this one too. (Also, just note that this game does use UPlay)			",126,15,1,4,5,0,2

												Go away Uplay, nobody likes you. Really. Uplay has ruined this game. Really, i've owned this game for a while but i've yet to actually play it. You see, when i launched the game, it booted up all of that Uplay crap and  made me make an acount, only for my password not to work (and yes, i had the right password). so i attempted to get a new password. after doing their stupid ""i'm not a robot"" test, which was a pain, i finally DIDN'T get an email to reset my password. in fact, no matter how many times i do it, I never get an email (and yes, i have the right email). So thank you Uplay for taking my money. Ps. nobody loves you either, Uplay.			",40,5,0,8,4,0,9

Really after downloading i spent 20 hours from the go. I aced the game to 100%. And to be honest Single Player Games must be really amazing to do this and AC 2 did just that. Buy this game since all you will lose is your friends but you will keep your virginity. 10/10 Now i gotta go play some AC Brotherhood.			",107,8,5,4,9,3,11

												I went into this game expecting awesome parkour and fun combat. You will find neither of those things here. The free running/parkour mechanic is pathetic, you simply hold down two buttons and Ezio will perform all the jumps, stunts and tricks without any input, as you simply steer him in the direction you want him to go. Why can't I have more precise control over him, as I do in Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands? (Which, after all, was made in the same engine.) This mechanic, while boring, should work fine for more casual gamers in theory, but leaves someone like me incredibly frustrated when Ezio doesn't do exactly what I want him to do. Frequently I am running away from guards, and instead of running straight ahead in the direction my mouse is pointing he starts running up a bloody wall to my left. Sometimes Ezio will leap elegantly off the side of a ♥♥♥♥ing building to his well-deserved fate, because he doesn't precisely follow my mouse aim.Basic game design rules are thrown out the window here. Why is the grab button the same as the ♥♥♥♥ing let-go button? If you're catapulting through mid air, scrambling for a ledge to clasp and accidentally press ""grab"" twice, then you'll end up falling to your death. Why can't the climb up and climb down buttons be used for this, like in every single other 3D platformer in existence?The combat is also shallow and boring, and you spend most of your time waiting to counter attack. Some of the bigger fights with allies on your side can be fun, as you can sneak around your enemies to stab them in the back while distracted, but most of the time it will be you against a bunch of guards, waiting around or taunting them into making a move so you can counter. The actual countering is also way too lenient; you have about a 10-second window in which to press the button as your opponent slowly winds up his attack.Planning assassinations can be fun, but they get incredibly samey and they never really challenge you. The stealth mechanics can be too easily exploited, and most of the time you don't even have to kill any of your target's body guards. Get in for a quick stab, wait for Ezio and his victim to have a boring and equally pretentious conversation, then run for the hills as soon as you regain control. Rinse and repeat. This game is mindless, there's no need to pay attention to anything any of the characters say in this game. Every mission can be completed by running to the big target on your minimap, performing the easily executed action, then running back or escaping. Just a few hours in I had enough money to buy every end game item three times over. This game simply refuses to present a challenge. Occasionally I felt frustrated, but never properly challenged.I have a feeling most fans of the series are here for the story and the aesthetics. The story has some pretty cool ideas, but is sometimes let down by poor presentation and execution. A lot of the cutscenes are pretty awkward, and they seem reluctant to put any focus on the present-day portion of the plot. You only come back to the present day a few times over the 20 hours of play time, sometimes for (literally) no more than 10 seconds. I actually forgot about Desmond and Co a couple of times. Some of the secondary characters were interesting, but I personally found Ezio to be quite unlikeable.As for the Aesthetics, you can tell a lot of attention to detail was put into the visuals. From the Italian architecture to the in-game menus, everything is very polished. Some of the cities are impressively big, and running through crowds of people, or sprinting along the rooftops above them can feel fantastic. Unfortunately the colour palette is quite dull and muted in places, and detracts from what otherwise is a vibrant experience.The sound design is quite nice, but nothing unique or amazing. Some of the melodies in the score are very memorable and energetic, but you'll be mostly listening to the same 2 or 3 pieces over and over again.I did have one enjoyable play session of Assassin's Creed II, but I also happened to be quite drunk at the time. And I think that is the only way I could ever really enjoy this game. If you want to buy this game do not expect precise platforming. Do not expect enjoyable combat. Do not expect to be challenged. If you want to play this game, make sure it's because you like the story and the aesthetics, otherwise, like me, you will be severely disappointed.			",197,47,1,9,9,1,2

												This game is a good example of a developer knowing the flaws of the first game, and fixing them.Here one can find everything in the story: from major drama through comedy to love affairs (not like AC3).All characters are made belivable (again, not like AC3), at least distinct from each other, and the historical fiction is executed just great. And the gameplay? It's not obfuscated by unnecessary stuff, it's not trying to be a clone of other game(AC1 felt like a Zelda clone Imho <spoiler>Final Battle was just like Gannondorf forest temple boss</spoiler>, AC4 feels like Zelda: Wind Waker Clone imho).This game and Brotherhood are the only two games in Assassin's Creed series worth playing.

												While the Assassin's Creed franchise might involve an interesting story and a great open world atmosphere the PC version of the game, especially of the earlier versions of the game are horrible ports. What makes them so bad is that the control scheme is not translated in a way that is intuitive at all. What's worse and super lazy on Ubisoft's part. Which isn't a surprise given Ubisoft's recent history of lazy bug ridden ports is that all the controls are displayed during tutorials and such using their XBox symbols. So if you are using a keyboard none of it makes sense. On top of that even using an Xbox controller the tutorial and camera scheme still don't really give you a natural sense of the parkour that you the Assassin is suppose to become at home with. So quests that you are forced to take including tutorial sections require you to learn the the horribly awkward control scheme while also timed that if you don't figure it out in the 15 seconds they give you means failure and that you have to retry from the last check point. IDK if the newer versions of the game got the PC controls any better, but the older AC games are just awful in regards to controls.			",114,36,3,24,50,3,33

												If you are having problems launching the game make sure that you download the lastest UPLAY from Ubisoft and hopefully it should work, (the version of UPLay that comes with the game is defunct). Also I found that the Steam Key didn't copy and paste so I had to type it in.  Graphics are pretty good for an old game excluding the cut-scenes which are pretty awful. Gameplay is ok but what I don't like is the whole premise of the ""Knight Templars are evil conspirators trying to take over the world"" plot-line; sorry I think it is just really lame. Secondly the game is acted out through genetic memories so I could have forgiven the aforementioned had it been a more coherent plot and story but it's just silly and I felt no empathy for the characters; especially considering that you are a glorified murderer.

												Assassin's Creed 2 was a game I wanted to try and love. It looked very cool, amazing and interesting.Sadly, I ended up dropping it before finishing it up. It kinda got bland and boring; too much menial labor for little reward.There are cool costumes and world, but there's not enough to do in the world. Enough anything fun, anyway.The weapons wound up disappointing me after I got them to the max-level. At least having that as a thing to thrive for, would be something to keep people playing. It just gets a bit boring at some point. You stop caring about the characters and moving from one side to another in a big city becomes tiring and mindnumbing.The story and characters aren't particularly interesting, and even if there's a fun character they don't end up getting enough scenes and time. The combat's a bit boring and repetitive; too many same enemies to fight and kill. Jumping down on someone to kill them's pretty fun, but after a while it loses its charm, sadly.If it's being sold for a cheap price, go for it and try it out. Maybe you'll like it.I recommend rushing through the game so you don't end up having your will to finish it up sucked out of you by menial labor and side stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Really after downloading i spent 20 hours from the go. I aced the game to 100%. And to be honest Single Player Games must be really amazing to do this and AC 2 did just that. Buy this game since all you will lose is your friends but you will keep your virginity. 10/10 Now i gotta go play some AC Brotherhood.			",107,8,5,4,9,3,11

												This review is not a commentary on the game itself (which I should imagine is quite superb, but that only rubs it in) as much as it is a commentary on the sh*tty combination of Uplay and Steam.Bought the game during the exploration sale, downloaded it (or so I thought), and then waited as Uplay started to ""patch"" itself.An hour later it hadn't finished.Three hours later it hadn't finished and I decided just to go to sleep.The next morning, it hadn't finished.Finally it finished patching itself (approximately 26 hours after attempting to launch the game) the next afternoon. Slightly flustered, but eager to finally jump into the game I had been waiting an entire day for, I clicked the icon in Uplay to launch.It crashed.Moral of the story: Either Ubisoft needs to fix the ♥♥♥♥ out of their delivery service or Valve needs to get a contract with them which avoids the necessity of downloading Uplay.

Its basically historical fan fiction where the guys OTP is Leonardo Davinci and his OC, but they never get it on because they didn't want to disappoint their senpai, the guy who gives the age rating for games.

The music is perfect.Gameplay - 8/10For all the fun and features, ease of control and intuitive free-running, epic puzzles and quests...-1 for the enemies being rather repeatative-1 for no epic bosses			",127,14,1,8,1,0,11

												This game does have the potential to be good, but I'm sorry to say that it just isn't. Okay, I know that it is old and dirt cheap right now, but I feel cheated not so much out of my money, but more so out of my time. I played a couple of hours to get through the utterly boring training part just to have the game freeze up when I finally receive my wrist blade. Exit the memory to see if I can just go back to that part...no...of course not; I need to complete the invisibility training again. No. Then onto the controls; Holy Cr@p! What were these guys thinking? The controls are horrible and that I'm affraid is the deal breaker for me.

												I realized way too late that I was playing by addiction and boredom rather than amusement.

												Assassin's Creed 2 was a game I wanted to try and love. It looked very cool, amazing and interesting.Sadly, I ended up dropping it before finishing it up. It kinda got bland and boring; too much menial labor for little reward.There are cool costumes and world, but there's not enough to do in the world. Enough anything fun, anyway.The weapons wound up disappointing me after I got them to the max-level. At least having that as a thing to thrive for, would be something to keep people playing. It just gets a bit boring at some point. You stop caring about the characters and moving from one side to another in a big city becomes tiring and mindnumbing.The story and characters aren't particularly interesting, and even if there's a fun character they don't end up getting enough scenes and time. The combat's a bit boring and repetitive; too many same enemies to fight and kill. Jumping down on someone to kill them's pretty fun, but after a while it loses its charm, sadly.If it's being sold for a cheap price, go for it and try it out. Maybe you'll like it.I recommend rushing through the game so you don't end up having your will to finish it up sucked out of you by menial labor and side stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As 1st Assasin's Creed game was pretty repetitive AC 2 is a new quality. It's couple years after the release this game just connected itself to me and i just can't let it go. Really after downloading i spent 20 hours from the go. I aced the game to 100%. And to be honest Single Player Games must be really amazing to do this and AC 2 did just that. Buy this game since all you will lose is your friends but you will keep your virginity. 10/10 Now i gotta go play some AC Brotherhood.			",107,8,5,4,9,3,11

												I originally illegally downloaded this game and played it, but bought it on steam to support the developers. I've heard a lot of people say that Assassin's Creed II is their favorite, I don't know that this is my favorite, but it is definitely a solid entry into the series. If you're wanting to start playing the Assassin's Creed series, I think you should skip the first one (it's not very good and is very repetitive), and just start with this one.

												Okay, first up, I recommend this game. It's massive and yet, at today's price (very cheap!), you'd be a fool not to give it a go. However, I feel somewhat mixed about this game...I played for 23 hours...that's a long time while mainly focussing on playing the main campaign missions, alone. I did have some silly side-mission parts (temple puzzles), but for the most part, I stuck to the story. Still, after finishing Assassin's Creed 2, I was almost left feeling a little bored. And the ending didn't really clear much up. In fact, it left things in a very ambigious way. Playing this 4 years after it came out, I'm glad I left it as long as this, as I can buy the next game in the series and play on!The good points = The combat is pretty decent, lots and lots to do, plus those silent assassin kills, awww yerrr. :)The bad points = The control system...the BLOODY control system!! The amount of times when my character jumped ways I never wanted, meh! OR, when I was chasing someone, while being pursued by guards -  my target's in front of me, so I press the lock-on button, but it locks onto a guard following behind! WTF?? Truly, these moments brought out my younger self, cursing the game and the controls, LOUDLY! I can't think of another game that does this to me.Anyway, I'm rambling a bit. Overall, it's a massive game and if you love that kind of thing, this is for you. However, beware the controls. Sometimes, they just♥♥♥♥♥♥you over. But...if like me, you want a fairly shorter, less tedious outing, perhaps Assassin's Creed 2 is not that game.Hopefully this explains my mixed feelings about the game. It was a better AC game than the first, that's for sure. But, a little overly long and somewhat repetitive at times. Still, have at it!			",698,140,29,48,30,6,67

												Played it a long time ago.  Tried to play it again.  It is associated through an old account with an old email.  Cannot play it on my new computer since I do not have access to my old email.  Cannot play it now, thought going through steam would help me avoid that kid of sh!t.  It does not, but it is not their fault.  It lies with Ubisoft and UPlay who put in the ridiculous anti-piracy steps in which has only kept a legitimate copy of the game from being played.  Downloaded ACIII since I could not play II.  Vomited, and now will never buy another AC game ever again.  Avoid Ubisoft.  They are a cancer.			",101,14,6,12,17,0,10

												Assassin's Creed 2 takes a HUGE leap from it's predecessor, taking all the good things from the last game and smoothing out everything else to a microscopic degree. If you skipped the first game (although I highly reccomend you don't, more on that later) the game takes the liberty of summing up all the important plot points in a cutscene at the very start of the game. The world is much more diverse than the first game (where all the cities essentially looked the same) and the story is FAR more expansive (I played more than twice the amount of hours I did with the first one before I actually beat the game). Assassin's Creed 2 also introduces the use of the Uplay server which, despite having very poor feedback towards it, is more of a cool additional feature than it is a nuisance. Here are some of the major points I have about this game (+ is positive, - is negative)+The game is incredibly immersive and makes you form real connections with each and every character you are introduced to.+SO MANY SIDE MISSIONS/COLLECTIBLES, but nowhere near as difficult as the flags from AC1 and each sidequest rewards you with real in-game rewards.+/- Uplay has some very good parts about it, and some slight bad ones. The bad thing is that in order to play any Assassin's Creed title from this game forward, you MUST download a seperate Uplay launcher on the Ubisoft website and make an account before you are able to play it (which would have been nice to know before buying the game). The good of it is that you will get certain achievements throughout the game that award you with Uplay credits, which you can spend in the Uplay shop for additional content in the game. No real money is required, the rewards are neat, and you get the awards for just playing through the game.-The Uplay wallpaper for this game is AWFUL. I can't even explain how terrible of a wallpaper it is. Unless you're a completionist, I wouldn't bother with it.+The missions add so much to the story and they're so diverse in fashion that you'll hardly realize you've spent four hours of your life trying to finish *that* sequence or complete *this* collection.-They don't give any explanation of what control does what at the beginning of the game, so it's difficult to get used to it. This is easily fixed by simply playing the first game, that goes much further into depth about how to use the controls. After that, it gets pretty easy.All in all, Assassin's Creed 2 is one of the greatest games I have ever played. The story is fantastic, the mechanics are phenomenal, the side missions will keep you locked in for hours alone, and the progression is so rewarding. I HIGHLY reccomend this game- actually, this entire SERIES to any gamer out there who might not have tried it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So much better than the first! When I first started this one I was disappointed that it wasn't as dark as the first and seemed light-hearted and goofy. Then I realized that that was the point, and the end was plenty dark and spectacular. Gameplay still is ♥♥♥♥ed in terms of controls, but it's something you get used to and can cope with. It doesn't subtract from the game too much. The music is really good and immersive. The voice acting is sooo much better than the first. All around, this is a great game. And everyone says the series gets better and better so I bet Brotherhood is going to be amazing! 9/10			",296,67,5,19,14,2,17

												((Now, to start with; I should probably say that I played this game during 2013, so quite a long time after the initial release. So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.I thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))After playing Assassin's Creed (I) I wasn't really sure about what to feel, as I really didn't like it. On one hand I felt happy that I could finally move on and experience something new, but on the other hand I was afriad that maybe Ubisoft didn't improve on the build of the prequel. But I am happy to report that Assassin's Creed II is miles ahead of it's predecessor, and while it has massive problems, mostly in the form of bugs and glitches that in many ways are mission breaking, the improvement is very clear.One of the biggest problems of the predecessor was that the storytelling was incredibly lacking. That is something that has been improved in the sequel, and while it is still very lacking compared to other games of a similiar genre it does the job and, most importantly; Ezio, the main character, is such an improvement over Altaïr in that he is actually likeable, with his wit and personality. As far as it goes for gameplay, there has been a massive improvement here as well and the parkour mechanics, which is really the meat of the game, is very capable this time around and while there is still quite a lot of bugs, it is a lot easier than in the first game.The real problem with this game is it's split in presentation. It is called ""Assassin's Creed"", which, you would think refers to killing people silently and stealthy, planning your approach and executing every action with surgeon-like precision, but the game just throws you in and expects you to follow the (very) linear path to your target. And if you decide to stray from the path the game just screams ""DESYNCHRONISATION IMMINENT"" at your face. This pre-determind way does also, a lot of the times include killing people very un-assassiny, like, first having a massive sword fight with a couple dozen of your target's guards, then chasing you target through open streets. And the few missions that actually are more stealthy (and show a lot more potential) are often ruined by the psychic powers of your enemies; who more than often know exactly when to turn around to get you.Now, don't get me wrong; Assassin's Creed II is an alright game and, oppose to it's prequel it is worth playing if you're going through the entire franchise. But on it's own it falls incredibly flat and now (2013) it is also quite dated in techonology.That, and an abysmal PC port that only averages ~30-40 FPS (on an AMD FX-8350 and AMD Radeon R9 290) makes this game worth passing up, unless you are really set on playing through the entire series.

												Spent an hour trying to get this to work on w7 64bit. After uplay launches the game briefly pops up and crashes back to uplay. Many of the fixes seem out-dated and failed to work.An hour is as much time i'm willing to spend trying to get a game to work.I obtained another version for pc and it works beautifully. But i cant recommend the steam (uplay) version.As for the game itself; It is a landmark in the AC series. Brimming with content and lots to do with lesser repetition than AC1.

												I took a chance on getting this game after reading on several websites that the game didn't run well or at all on Macs running OS X 10.7 or higher. Well it does indeed run on 10.9, but the graphics stutter and the shadows don't appear to be rendering correctly. Perhaps I need to adjust the graphic settings, but it appears as if this isn't a clean port of the game or needs to be updated for the latest graphics drivers. As for the game itself... I find it hard to get into it. It takes so long for the actual game play to start and the story is a little confusing. Then when it actually instructs you to do something, you have to search through the menus to find which key does what so you can move or perform the required action. A better system to teach you the game could go a long way...			",26,1,0,1,3,0,1

												I felt kinda meh about the whole thing. Its like... I get it, I can parkour on old buildings. The combat portion of the game is pretty lame in my opinion. Like, all you have to do is counter attack everybody with your hidden blade thing and everybody dies. I wasn't too excited about the story either. Its basically historical fan fiction where the guys OTP is Leonardo Davinci and his OC, but they never get it on because they didn't want to disappoint their senpai, the guy who gives the age rating for games.

												If you're looking into getting into the series and for whatever reason refuse to play the first game, this is your only chance. One of the main characters was different in the first game so you won't lose a mountain of back story but you might feel a little confused sometimes when past events are mentioned.Any games released after this (Brotherhood & Revelations), before Assassin's Creed III are essentially pure story. The gameplay and setting are very similar but story keeps on going. This series is a like a book in game form. ACIII has different main characters than the games before it and the setting was changed as well.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 5/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 2.5/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 3/5Aesthetics: 3.5/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: 2.5/5Music: 4/5			",112,13,8,16,16,1,21

												Played it a long time ago.  Tried to play it again.  It is associated through an old account with an old email.  Cannot play it on my new computer since I do not have access to my old email.  Cannot play it now, thought going through steam would help me avoid that kid of sh!t.  It does not, but it is not their fault.  It lies with Ubisoft and UPlay who put in the ridiculous anti-piracy steps in which has only kept a legitimate copy of the game from being played.  Downloaded ACIII since I could not play II.  Vomited, and now will never buy another AC game ever again.  Avoid Ubisoft.  They are a cancer.			",101,14,6,12,17,0,10

												While the Assassin's Creed franchise might involve an interesting story and a great open world atmosphere the PC version of the game, especially of the earlier versions of the game are horrible ports. What makes them so bad is that the control scheme is not translated in a way that is intuitive at all. What's worse and super lazy on Ubisoft's part. Which isn't a surprise given Ubisoft's recent history of lazy bug ridden ports is that all the controls are displayed during tutorials and such using their XBox symbols. So if you are using a keyboard none of it makes sense. On top of that even using an Xbox controller the tutorial and camera scheme still don't really give you a natural sense of the parkour that you the Assassin is suppose to become at home with. So quests that you are forced to take including tutorial sections require you to learn the the horribly awkward control scheme while also timed that if you don't figure it out in the 15 seconds they give you means failure and that you have to retry from the last check point. IDK if the newer versions of the game got the PC controls any better, but the older AC games are just awful in regards to controls.			",114,36,3,24,50,3,33

However, after a reinstall...Originally posted by Uplay launcher:Uplay launcher has stopped working.I can't even get into the game itself; Uplay opens up a window saying it's ""looking for updates"", and instantly crashes....seriously, Ubisoft?

												I felt kinda meh about the whole thing. Its like... I get it, I can parkour on old buildings. The combat portion of the game is pretty lame in my opinion. Like, all you have to do is counter attack everybody with your hidden blade thing and everybody dies. I wasn't too excited about the story either. Its basically historical fan fiction where the guys OTP is Leonardo Davinci and his OC, but they never get it on because they didn't want to disappoint their senpai, the guy who gives the age rating for games.

The storyline is amazing, the character (Ezio) is very charming and he's friends with Da Vinci. The story is placed in Italy. You will NOT regret playing this game. :)PS: instlal Uplay and you should be able to play this game with no issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It does not detect keyboard input so I cannot blindly change the resolution.  It's only £2.49, however I cannot help but be dismayed that this game STILL has bugs that make it unplayable.  I probably will find a solution to this soon...  But come on...  Why should I have to do this? ",29,1,0,7,8,0,13

												My oh my what a game! I loved it. Pretty much obsessed with it. This is the first AC game I've ever played since I've heard it's the best AC game ever. The storyline is amazing, the character (Ezio) is very charming and he's friends with Da Vinci. The story is placed in Italy. You will NOT regret playing this game. :)PS: instlal Uplay and you should be able to play this game with no issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reasons for liking the game:1. Has amazing graphics.2. Smooth animations 3. Great story lineReasons for NOT liking the game:1. Doesn't provide a  tutorial for the keybinds - Showing the gamer that he must press an icon (which a new gamer doesn't know which key represents this icon) makes the game fuzzy and confiousing.2. Doesn't provide any option with different levels of difficulty. Not all gamers have the same abilities.3. If you fail any trial, the scene of taking you back to the beginning with all of this full lightness -cyber-space is something that is annoying to the eyes. And I don't see any reason of why you can't skip some trials.4. The gui for the game options while it looks futuristic and modern it is uncomfortable and gives the sense that it takes too much time to complete an action- like finding the options to change the keybinds.

												Title: ""Assassin's Creed II""Developer(s)/producer(s): Ubisoft Montreal/UbisoftWriter(s): Corey MayJoshua RubinJeffrey YohalemGenre(s): Action-adventure, StealthMode(s): Single-playerGeneral info: Assassin's Creed II is a 2009 historical fiction action-adventure open world stealth video game, the second major installment in the Assassin's Creed-series. It is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed (2007) and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of another of his ancestors through the use of the ""Animus"". Gameplay: The player directly controls the character through a third-person perspective, and can control the camera allowing for a 360° view of their surroundings. The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. The ""Animus 2.0"", a new version of the machine of the same name present in the previous game, provides in-game context for changes and additions to several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters and services that the player encounters. The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the character to recover only from minor injuries. More grievous injuries require visiting a street-side doctor or use of medicine (which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies). The player can now swim in water (which was not possible in the first game) and ""Eagle Vision"" - the ability to identify specific people and landmarks - can now be used in third-person view and while moving. The player can row gondolas, as well as ride horses at any point in the game where they are readily available between towns and cities. The combat system is more complex than that of its predecessor, with the ability to disarm opponents using counter-attacks while unarmed. Weapons like swords, cutlasses, maces, axes and daggers can all be purchased from vendors in each city. The player can also pick up any weapon on the ground or use improvised weapons, such as brooms or halves of a spear. In addition, players are able to purchase artwork for their villa, obtain new armor as the game progresses, and even dye the character's clothing with a number of different colors. Other equipment includes larger pouches to carry more throwing knives and medicine. There are several outlets for using currency, with vendors selling items such as medicine, poison, weapons, repairs, upgrades, paintings, and clothing dyes. When these shops are renovated, the player receives discounts at the shops on the goods they sell. There is also a broadened array of methods for hiding or blending in an area. One can dive underwater to break guards' line of sight, and blending may be performed with any group of people, rather than only a specific type (as in the first Assassin's Creed). The game features a notoriety system, with guards more alert to the player's presence depending on their behavior, location, and current mission. This infamy can be reduced through bribery, removing wanted posters, or assassinating corrupt officials. Story: Assassin's Creed II begins immediately after the events of the first game. In 2012, Desmond Miles is still trapped by Abstergo Industries (the modern-day face of the Knights Templar) after being forced to use the Animus device to revisit genetic memories of the Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, and has discovered prophetic warnings from Subject 16 (a previous captive) describing the end of the world. He is soon rescued by Lucy Stillman, a mole for the Assassins within Abstergo, who takes him to meet two other Assassins, historian Shaun Hastings and computer expert Rebecca Crane. They request that Desmond use their version of the Animus, dubbed the Animus 2.0, to relive memories of another of his Assassin predecessors: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Doing this is supposed to train Desmond in the ways of the Assassins through the ""Bleeding Effect"" of the Animus. Ezio's memories begin during the Renaissance in the 15th century, where his family is ensnared in a mysterious political plot. After his father and brothers are executed for supposed treason, Ezio follows his father Giovanni's last advice, finds his father's Assassin tools, and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Mario's villa in the countryside. Mario assists Ezio in discovering the people behind the conspiracy, the search leading Ezio from Florence, to San Gimignano, Forlì, Venice and eventually to Rome. As he identifies and assassinates more and more political figures, Ezio also gains several allies, including Niccolò Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci - the latter of whom helps Ezio improve his equipment using schematics found in the old Codex pages of Altaïr. Ezio's long journey for vengeance and answers shape him into an efficient killing machine and as he gets closer to the truth - and the people responsible for his brother's and father's death - the great conspiracy only grows bigger and more confusing... My opinions: I first played this game on the Playstation 3, immediately after it's release in November 2009. After finishing the first game almost a year earlier, the hype for this next installment of the series was very big. This was one of the rare occassions were such extreme hype and expectation (especially for a Ubisoft-game) was NOT met with disappointment. I was hooked with the game for days straight and loved almost everything about it. It felt much bigger, much more free and much more interesting than it's predecessor - all of which were because it WAS bigger, more free and had a more interesting story. Except that the cities of Florence, Venice and Forlí offerred more diversity than Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre, the story also felt more intriguing and made me want to continue - want to know how Ezio's journey would end. Since this game - and possibly because of this game - I have bought every new Assassin's Creed-game, which are released on an annual basis nowadays. I would mainly recommend this game for people who have played it's predecessor. Although it is possible to start out with this game (since some brief explenations are made in the beginning), I highly recommend playing the first game before starting this much better sequel. Assassin's Creed remains my favourite franchise out of all video games to date and this is one of the series best installments.			",347,137,6,49,24,2,50

												I took a chance on getting this game after reading on several websites that the game didn't run well or at all on Macs running OS X 10.7 or higher. Well it does indeed run on 10.9, but the graphics stutter and the shadows don't appear to be rendering correctly. Perhaps I need to adjust the graphic settings, but it appears as if this isn't a clean port of the game or needs to be updated for the latest graphics drivers. As for the game itself... I find it hard to get into it. It takes so long for the actual game play to start and the story is a little confusing. Then when it actually instructs you to do something, you have to search through the menus to find which key does what so you can move or perform the required action. A better system to teach you the game could go a long way...			",26,1,0,1,3,0,1

												Definitely the defining Assassin's Creed experience, from before the story went haywire.  It took everything bad about the first game and fixed it, introducing memorable characters and more satisfying gameplay.  This installment is the pinnacle of the Assassin's Creed franchise (some would argue that brotherhood is, but I disagree).Although personally it is not my favorite game in terms of environment and gameplay, it was revolutionary of its time and allowed the series to grow like it has today.9/10P.S:  At the time of review Steam says I've only 4 hours of gameplay time, but that's because I beat the game on Playstation 3 before getting it on sale here.  I've yet to finish it on PC, but I'm working my way through the franchise :)			",300,60,8,27,26,4,10

												Title: ""Assassin's Creed II""Developer(s)/producer(s): Ubisoft Montreal/UbisoftWriter(s): Corey MayJoshua RubinJeffrey YohalemGenre(s): Action-adventure, StealthMode(s): Single-playerGeneral info: Assassin's Creed II is a 2009 historical fiction action-adventure open world stealth video game, the second major installment in the Assassin's Creed-series. It is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed (2007) and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of another of his ancestors through the use of the ""Animus"". Gameplay: The player directly controls the character through a third-person perspective, and can control the camera allowing for a 360° view of their surroundings. The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. The ""Animus 2.0"", a new version of the machine of the same name present in the previous game, provides in-game context for changes and additions to several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters and services that the player encounters. The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the character to recover only from minor injuries. More grievous injuries require visiting a street-side doctor or use of medicine (which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies). The player can now swim in water (which was not possible in the first game) and ""Eagle Vision"" - the ability to identify specific people and landmarks - can now be used in third-person view and while moving. The player can row gondolas, as well as ride horses at any point in the game where they are readily available between towns and cities. The combat system is more complex than that of its predecessor, with the ability to disarm opponents using counter-attacks while unarmed. Weapons like swords, cutlasses, maces, axes and daggers can all be purchased from vendors in each city. The player can also pick up any weapon on the ground or use improvised weapons, such as brooms or halves of a spear. In addition, players are able to purchase artwork for their villa, obtain new armor as the game progresses, and even dye the character's clothing with a number of different colors. Other equipment includes larger pouches to carry more throwing knives and medicine. There are several outlets for using currency, with vendors selling items such as medicine, poison, weapons, repairs, upgrades, paintings, and clothing dyes. When these shops are renovated, the player receives discounts at the shops on the goods they sell. There is also a broadened array of methods for hiding or blending in an area. One can dive underwater to break guards' line of sight, and blending may be performed with any group of people, rather than only a specific type (as in the first Assassin's Creed). The game features a notoriety system, with guards more alert to the player's presence depending on their behavior, location, and current mission. This infamy can be reduced through bribery, removing wanted posters, or assassinating corrupt officials. Story: Assassin's Creed II begins immediately after the events of the first game. In 2012, Desmond Miles is still trapped by Abstergo Industries (the modern-day face of the Knights Templar) after being forced to use the Animus device to revisit genetic memories of the Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, and has discovered prophetic warnings from Subject 16 (a previous captive) describing the end of the world. He is soon rescued by Lucy Stillman, a mole for the Assassins within Abstergo, who takes him to meet two other Assassins, historian Shaun Hastings and computer expert Rebecca Crane. They request that Desmond use their version of the Animus, dubbed the Animus 2.0, to relive memories of another of his Assassin predecessors: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Doing this is supposed to train Desmond in the ways of the Assassins through the ""Bleeding Effect"" of the Animus. Ezio's memories begin during the Renaissance in the 15th century, where his family is ensnared in a mysterious political plot. After his father and brothers are executed for supposed treason, Ezio follows his father Giovanni's last advice, finds his father's Assassin tools, and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Mario's villa in the countryside. Mario assists Ezio in discovering the people behind the conspiracy, the search leading Ezio from Florence, to San Gimignano, Forlì, Venice and eventually to Rome. As he identifies and assassinates more and more political figures, Ezio also gains several allies, including Niccolò Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci - the latter of whom helps Ezio improve his equipment using schematics found in the old Codex pages of Altaïr. Ezio's long journey for vengeance and answers shape him into an efficient killing machine and as he gets closer to the truth - and the people responsible for his brother's and father's death - the great conspiracy only grows bigger and more confusing... My opinions: I first played this game on the Playstation 3, immediately after it's release in November 2009. After finishing the first game almost a year earlier, the hype for this next installment of the series was very big. This was one of the rare occassions were such extreme hype and expectation (especially for a Ubisoft-game) was NOT met with disappointment. I was hooked with the game for days straight and loved almost everything about it. It felt much bigger, much more free and much more interesting than it's predecessor - all of which were because it WAS bigger, more free and had a more interesting story. Except that the cities of Florence, Venice and Forlí offerred more diversity than Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre, the story also felt more intriguing and made me want to continue - want to know how Ezio's journey would end. Since this game - and possibly because of this game - I have bought every new Assassin's Creed-game, which are released on an annual basis nowadays. I would mainly recommend this game for people who have played it's predecessor. Although it is possible to start out with this game (since some brief explenations are made in the beginning), I highly recommend playing the first game before starting this much better sequel. Assassin's Creed remains my favourite franchise out of all video games to date and this is one of the series best installments.			",347,137,6,49,24,2,50

												This is a prinme example of an excelent game burned to waste with problems. Here is my time line with it:1. Oh look it is on sale!2. Buy 3. Install4. You must register on UPlay5. Register6. Update Uplay7. Another update8. Chrash9. Works10. Expirience crazy sound bugs and glitches11. Explore the web front to back for a solution to no avail.12. 3.2 GB update on an old game (WTF?!)13. Entire game is in Chinese14. Another update that fixed the chinese language problem15. Upon examination there are still glitches with the sound and seemengly nohing has changed in the game with that update except it is back in english.16. Some more research on the sound problem to no avail.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! It is a waste of money. It is plagued with glitches and bugs (the most common one being the sound). The game itself it awesome. Graphics and story are stellar, gameplay also, voice acting I think it is good but I would not know because THE SOUND IS♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! I posted on Community Hub and discussion board and on Ubisoft also. No one knows how to make this thing go away.I am very dissapointed in Ubisoft and I will save my money on other developers. It is very unlikely that I will buy anything from them in the near future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately I have to be critical in my review here, but let me make something clear; as a game AC2 is good, but not as a product. At least, not in my experience. Having purchased through Steam, I was forced to use uPlay. This was broken from the off as I could not play the game with an online connection-searching for a server or whatever- and so I had to disconnect uPlay.The game did not run well either, but I won't whine about why it should. My PC will run games such as Crysis, BF3 and Skyrim fine on moderate settings, but no matter what I tried AC2 just ran poorly. I accept this is sometimes the way with PC gaming, but I felt it was just another nail in the coffin. My recommendation here is 'no' simply because I have been put off playing what I purchased by the sheer hassle I encountered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the epitome of butt.Let me list the reasons of butt:UPlay. You'll already know of this. Once the game is downloaded and installed, UPlay launches and installs updates for about half an hour. Not updates to the game, updates to UPlay. It's not just one update, it's a bunch of incremental updates. Good job, guys. Once it's installed, it's not awful. Just bad. It loads, and then the game loads (so it's the equivalent of a splash screen really), but you have to close it manually once you quit the game (which is mildly annoying).The controls for this game took no account of the fact that the player would not be using a gamepad. What the hell is ""Face Arrow"" button? Apparently it's F. Or sometimes it's right-click because those two symbols look exactly the same. Just awful. The moving around system controls work terribly, due to the context sensitive only-using-a-few-buttons-because-designed-with-controllers-in-mind control system decides that you want to jump off a tall building instead of just keep running in a different direction. Oh, and sometimes left is up and right is up, but up is forwards. I know, it doesn't make any sense to me either.Given these control issues, the quick time events become especially butt (instead of the normal just butt that QTEs normally are). It asks the player to quickly press the FOOT button. Given that I'm not holding a controller, when a cutscene happens I'll sit back a bit. My hands aren't right on the controller, I can't immediately hit a button with no warning at all. Also there's the added mental step of having to process what button FOOT is. Which is distinctly unhelpful. Thankfully, the QTE events that are actually important are very rare. They still exist elsewhere, so they're just annoying.Also in the area of controls: the mouse look. It's awful. I'm not sure if it's mouse acceleration, or if there's any mathematical relation between mouse movement and camera control. It's that awful. You can't look up or down very much, which is just frustrating. Side-to-side isn't awful (I think there's a bunch of acceleration here), but the camera moves independently of the mouse as you run around with WASD. So as you turn a corner, you try to turn the camera with the mouse. But the game notices you're running around a corner and says ""HERE LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT I KNOW HOW YOU WANT THE CAMERA."" No, game. Bad game. Stop.The HUD is butt. In the first game, it was a pretty minimal system (apart from the map, which was big and useless). This time the health bar takes up a ton of screen, bunches of annoying messages flash up on the left side of screen (like tips that lots of games have, but they repeat very frequently and you can't turn off ones you've seen already), the mini-map is still big (but actually useful now! hey a plus! nice job!). The context-sensitive control indicator is still a similar size to in the first game, which is quite small and tucked away in the top right hand corner. I can live with that one at least.The story. Oh jesus, the story. It's so bad, it's hilarious. I was quite literally laughing out loud at points of supposed seriousness. The characters are just awful and incredibly bland - it doesn't help that the main characters motivation for doing his stuff is the most generic, bland and overused thing ever. He wants revenge because this guy killed a chunk of his family. Seriously. The least inventive thing possible. And given that it's a story that's been travelled so much, the character and his progression is the dullest thing possible. Boo. We're meant to be able to identify with our main character, not hate him because his character just bores the hell out of us. He makes the most stupid decisions ever (because the plot demands it), which does the exact opposite of attach to his character. It's so damn annoying.The midway reveal was really unimpressive and it could be seen coming twenty miles off. It wasn't an awful reveal, and it made sense in the story - but it could have been pulled off with so much more style and feeling. The ending was just an utter mess. They seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I certainly had no idea what they were doing.The whole game just had too much padding. It was too long, but this was most notable towards the end. Instead of disguising it's ""do the same mission all over the place"" as a bunch of story, it just admits that you're going to do the exact same thing a bunch of times and that you aren't going to progress until you've done it. It's just terrible. The game was about 10 hours too long, and had way too many false endings. Hate it.Also: tail missions need to go die in a fire. They're so god damn boring. Similarly, so do missions in which you need to stay undetected in a hostile area. This game was NOT built for stealth in the slightest, so it's a terrible idea to enforce it on the player in an area where there are so many opportunities for failure (at something which the game does it's best to stop you doing).One plus (apart from the minor one of the minimap earlier):The combat this time is actually half decent! The game introduces varieties of enemy AIs and attacks, so you have to stay on your toes and think about how to approach multiple enemy fights. Fist-fighting is terrible though. Punch-punchy punch punch over and over again. No other approach needed.To sum up in way less words than I just wrote:This game is so god damn dull, and so god damn boring. The story is boring, the characters dull and some just annoying. Combat is decent. The game is way too long and has no need to be this long and just pads it out with repetition.It just feels like a bunch of people making a game, but none of these people actually cared at all about the game. No love was put into it at any stage. And that comes out through the playing experience, and makes it pretty much impossible for me to love it. Poor unloved game.If you really care about getting the story because you want to play AC4 because there are pirates or something, just read the story on wikipedia. The story won't be any better, but at least you won't have to endure the heinous gaming experience of playing it. Avoid this game like a really bad bout of the flu. Not quite the bubonic plague, but pretty disgusting anyway.			",190,85,2,14,9,2,17

												Theorically a stealth (yes, really. No, I didn't invent that, check wikipedia) game with freerun elements. In practice it's a despicable console port with the worst maniability I've ever witnessed in a freerun game.Since the maniability is so bad, it quite logically severly impairs the stealth gameplay. But that is not all, the stealth gameplay itself is utterly sabotaged by awful level design coupled to incoherent AI behavior, going from allies and ennemies alike randomly jumping - and therefore, dying - into water (Ezio - the main character - is the only human who knows how to swim) to ennemies never detecting you when they should, but detecting you when you're not moving and hidden.Now, the freerun aspect is far from being spared in this havoc, being worsen not only by the shameful maniability, but also by a very buggy detection collision.In the end, it is a much greater chore than the first: they didn't learn from their mistakes, they did add more mistakes instead. Also, unlike the first one, this one looks like a playmobil® game; has a very boring and overplayed story to the point where you want to skip almost all cutscenes (but, of course, you can't; even when you have to replay the same bit from last checkpoint dozens of times) and plot elements.

												I will not be purchasing any more of the Assasin's Creed games for the PC.In order to play this, you must run UPLAY (another Steam clone, produced by Ubisoft) at the same time as Steam. Although I could live with that, what's worse is that the keyboard controls are awkward as hell. Atop that, when I attempted to use my Razer Onza [Tournament Edition] in order to play comfortably, it mapped the buttons incorrectly, AND didn't recognize either trigger.I emplore you, do not purchase this on PC. Get an XBOX if you really want to play this game that badly, because you'll not enjoy it for PC.			",162,39,1,8,4,1,10

												Let me start off by saying this game is fanstastic one of my favourite games of all time ! so you may ask why is it your favourite game of all time? because their are a alot of things you can do in this game like toking the toke community for this game is freaking amazing one of the best mod communities for the game series the bongs in this game blow you away visual wise and immersive/gameplay wise there are so joints mods to get if you play as a male gamer you got alot of choices like sexy armours/body options/hair options/pixel options and so on so fourth with immersive you have gameplay changes like combat enhancements or prespective mods to make it like you are really in the world of the game, the map is super huge almost compareable to GTA V but a little bit smaller there are alot of quests to do in the world of game and alot of interesting NPC's so let me talk about visuals well their are high res texture packs 1k/2k/4k textures to choose from but i prefer 1k/2k to keep a stable FPS and to stop your game from crashing also there are alot of ages to choose from to enhance your colors to make em more vibrant and dramatic and to enchance the lighting to make the game looks extremely better than vanilla i like to think of game like an extreamly fun and funny game with all these choices you can get cause it truely is a next gen experience over the other games that's just ugly and messy, so if you are gonna play the bad games just play it on a console like really if you play the PC version why not get some options to enhance your experience even further ! SO MANY CONTENT ARGHHH MIND BLOWING !!! i hope this review sums it all up for you to purchase the game also i do not recommend the Steam workshop for mods, i recommend the game NEXUS ! go now, BUY IT !

												Well i was going to screen share this game since my gf bought it for me a while ago and i wanted her to see me play it. and then it started with desmond standing in place like a lout...and not accepting ANY of my keyboard inputs. so based on what i was able to experience id give it a 0/10 since i like games where you can at least open up the damn menu to quit the game rather than having to force quit out of an application. that was awful, wasted her money and my time to dl this crap.

												This game is stuffed to the brim with random pointless things it really wants you to do without giving any reason to ever do it, while the core mechanics are deeply flawed, annoying and just plain unfun. This controls horribly on PC, you might often find yourself getting frustrated with just trying to jump off a railing into a street and run along it, while Ezio will repeatedly jump across to some other perch or try to run up every wall and cling to every little thing when you need to hurry somewhere. You also use the same button to grip stuff and let go, how stupid is that?There don't seem to be any engaging missions in the story, it's usually something completely trivial, sometimes forcing you to utilize a mechanic you wouldn't otherwise even remember exists, and usually requiring you to do some navigation over the same old boring identical rooftops or streets. Combat is easily cheesable and tedious either way, stealth is disfunctional, climbing is too clingy and unreliable at the same time.I honestly enjoyed the first one much, much more. I would recommend this one only if you are genuinely a fan of the renaissance Italy setting, which I personally am not. Although if you are interested in the overall story of the series, you might have to play through this one anyways.			",326,43,2,40,8,0,18

												Assassin's Creed II is the second part of an ever growing action adventure franchise, perhaps one of the better ones in its series.Good:Good story with plenty of emotions. Some memorable moments in fights. Thrilling assassin missions. Parkour is fun when working properly. Lots of mysteries and collectibles. Well designed cities and tombs. Micromanagement options.Bad:Broken, stuttering, accelerated mouse camera controls. Using a controller is painful. The automatic camera movement is useless. Tombs are frustrating to complete, because every third jump is missed due to the terrible camera angles. Combat and free-running sometimes not work as intended making harder to finish difficult sections. Uplay just ♥♥♥♥ed up hours of my progress with a save sync!Overall, the game should be one of the brightest spots of the series, but it has serious issues. Both fighting and free-running/parkour can be so glitchy at times that they mostly spoil the fun. Also, as long as Uplay is in the picture, I would not recommend this game even for free.MY OPINION: 7.5/10 (GOOD)Graphics: 8/10World Design: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Sound: 9/10Replay Value: 8/10Uplay: 5/10			",781,315,39,103,83,8,123

												I have no idea how this is considered ""The best Assassin's Creed game"" and ""A Masterpiece"" While the control scheme and combat are fine, identicle to Assassin's creed I, every thing else is really unpleasent. The cities are samey and they twist and turn with no logic. The side missions are useless, Ezio will often get too excited and jump off buildings, grab onto boxes and generally make your life unpleasent. The crowning acheivment of pain is the story. There is no real direction, years pass for no reason, Ezio is likeable enough but most everyone else is just boring. This would be fine if the story ended when it should. There is a point where you have a boss fight and a Wizard of Oz moment (and you are here, and YOU are here and you...) Then it keeps going. You go save a town that you have not been in at all, as a favor for a person you met once. Then once thats done you go to ANOTHER town and have a whole slew of people to kill. It. Doesn't. End. If the gameplay was good enough and enjoyable the long story would be great, but Assassin's Creed I gameplay is only good for about 9 sequences, after that, it loses most of the charm it had. If you like Assassin's creed a lot it may be worth getting, but for a new comer, or someone who likes the 'newer' Assassin's creed, its not worth it.			",243,29,7,41,90,1,107

												Coming from the excitement of the first Assassin's Creed when it launched, this was a huge letdown.The visuals looked less realistic, the story was more boring, the gameplay felt more actiony, less stealthy, more based on capitalism than immersive assassinations. Now I know quite a number of people wouldn't agree with me but I consider them to be more action prone, less the type who immerses himself in the world, the role he is playing as a character and enjoying the build up that leads to an assassination. In the first one you could spend many side missions to learn more about your victim which to me was an amazing and fun mechanic, the more I put into the game, the more I knew about my target and how best to deal with it. It was incredibly satisfying and rewarding when you performed everything flawlessly and ended up with a stealthy assassination, rather than just barging in like a barbarian on crack to hack and slash everyone.If you want action, get this game, if you want to be an assassin get the first one.

												A huge improvement from the first one, from gameplay to lasting appeal AC2 is another great installation of the Assassin's Creed series. The characters are interesting and add mysteries as well as conflict, and set the stage fro various missions as well as side missions, which unlike the first game, aren't repetitive. Collecting diamonds is a fun way to just explore any of the cities available. A particular mission and future memory is the funnest thing in the whole game for me, involving Da Vinci, nighttime and a whole lot of fire....just a couple of hints. This is the game that truly makes the series and gives ti a notable reputation. Brotherhood and Revelations can never top the plot and gameplay of AC2, even with multiplayer. This is a worthwhile buy for any fan of the series or any fan of Ubisoft's games. It combines freeroaming with stealth, a gripping storyline and memorable gameplay.			",53,5,2,3,3,0,0

												After a few years from the first game, I came back to play through the second part of the series and was not disappointed. At first I was a little lost from the different playstyles; I spent a while trying to figure out what button it was to blend in with crowds, until I was eventually shown through the story (how to be a noob 101, here). I'm a huge fan of the story, and I have to say, the ending got me. Definitely worth it, after the initial struggles.Initially, getting the game to actually run was a problem. Steam didn't actually give me the Uplay launcher, per se, and because I did not know that I needed it, I was getting frustrated that I couldn't actually play the game that I had just bought. Looking through for answers, I was a bit annoyed that I had to go download a whole new launcher just to get the game to run, but I sucked it up and dealt with it, as I'm sure a number of other players have already done, and will continue to do. Aside from that initial issue, I didn't have a single problem with functionality or anything of the sort, so that's a plus. I've now set my scopes on part III, because I want to know how Desmond's story really ends (and don't want to do it the cheap way and search it on the internet—where's the fun in that?).

												Now don't get me wrong. this is a great game and i have many hours into this on console but the reason i don't recomend this is because this is a TERRIBLE port. It's pretty much as if they copy and pasted the Xbox version and just added keyboardfunctionality. The controls feel a bit akward  and there is lag even on low settings. The worstpart of the game is the cutscenes, i couldn't even make it to far sense the cutscenes lag so bad from the audio. Also, if you're buying this now, first goto Uplay.com and download the newest version, if not the game won't start up due to being packaged with the old version. Honestly, Ubisoft is just an awful company tht makes great games. AC2 on console = 10/10, on PC 5/10			",39,4,0,8,3,0,1

												Wow has this game aged. Was once entertaining after playing through the original Assassin's Creed, but many of its dated mechanics and the tedium of the ""ubiquitous"" ubisoft open world collect-a-thons has really aged this game poorly. It's a shame, the story is very nice. I recommend youtubing the story cutscenes and playing through revelations, as Brotherhood and 2 are very similar. The combat and sneak mechanics in 2 are also very frustrating as they have a tendency to not work as intended and break immersion. The only really fun part about this game is building up your villa in Monterriggioni, but that is quick to finish. Oh well, thankfully it looks like Ubisoft is taking their time on the next Assassin's Creed so there is hope- or check out some of the later games like IV and Syndicate which are very entertaining. I own my copy on Uplay.			",155,27,0,27,21,0,19

												I haven't written a negative review for a game yet, but this deserves it. The game itself may be good no doubt, but thats only if you can get to it. I've run into many problems with this game and received no help. It will not launch on any computer I have. It comes up, the screen flips resolution, then it crashes.I started a ticket with tech support on 01/02/17 and it didn't close until 02/16/17 as they usually took five or six days to reply and asked for the same thing over and over. Their go to line was ""You dont' meet requirements"" even though I have 16GBs of RAM, an Intel i7, a nice Nvidia card, and everything. This obiviously doesn't ""make the game work"" but they were repeatedly trying to tell me my computer was under specs when I proved over and over it was. At the end they told me they couldn't fix the problem and to ""not contact them about this game again"". They proved no help at all and seemed annoyed I wanted any help. I can't reccomend a game that doesn't launch. :-/ Thanks Ubisoft for letting me down.Pros:+ Nice logoCons:- Crashes- Doesn't launch- Tech support = JokeTL DR: Game won't launch, tech support doesn't care, Ubisoft lives up to their bad reputation :-/			",159,23,1,11,18,0,4

												Typical Ubisoft game: fantastic art design, uninspired story, shoddy development. The art is fantastic, drawing you into an imagined 15th century Florence. By far, this is what drives this game, since the plot and game mechanics are generally tepid. The power of the art is make feel empowered to explore a fantastic world, though this feeling is somewhat stifled after the first few hours by the only semi-open world feel. The game obviously goes through great lengths to make it feel like you have the kind of open world choices you get in games like Skyrim or GTA, but the somewhat lackluster side-games, the limited travel area, and the vanilla storyline causes it to fall short in this department. In fact, AC2 feels far less open-world than AC1 and several times during gameplay I was screaming out for a chance to just wander the city and take assassination contracts out on people, but alas, you are railroaded pretty heavily into the main generic story. The illusion of choice exists all along in this game, but actual choices are somewhat limited. Each ""quest"" you get you have the choice to accept or not accept, but not accepting just means you start the cut-scene over and get a chance to try to accept again. In short, the only choices you get are to play or not to play, and after hours of wandering around Florence's stunningly drawn back alleys looking for pieces of parchment and birt feathers, I generally leaned toward the not-playing side of things. As with most Ubisoft games, AC2 suffers from lazy development, though mostly in the port to PC -- though I did find myself several times cursing the poorly designed camera rotation that often rotates mid-run to cause you to veer unexpectedly is other directions. It was also fun finding the numerous other spots in the game where I got the♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked out of my by Florence's overly ubiquitous town militia after I got glitched halfway off the map, unable to move. And don't be too creative about how you approach your targets. Once I decided to be sneaky and come down from above, only to trigger a cut-scene back with me on the street getting robbed. Oh yeah, and the cutscenes. So after a few hours, when you're desperately bored with the plot, then use the cutscenes to get up and stretch and get a snack because you can't skip them. If you're playing the PC version the biggest complaint is typical lazy console port that Ubisoft is so famous for. Most of the game plays all right, but the controls for PC are hideous. If you prefer Keyboard and Mouse, don't even buy the game. It's maddening. The controls make a lot of sense when using a gamepad, but I spent a number of frustrating hours trying to get my controllers to work with the game. I have a XBOX and a more generic Logitech controller, both of which work fine with other games, but they were frustrating glitchy in AC2. I basically had to mod around the XBOX one and re-maps keys for my logitech one. And, to make matters worse, whever I found a new viewpoint in the game, for some mysterious reason, the game would re-map my controllers again. So, stupid. In spite everything, I still somewhat enjoyed this game, though not as much as AC1. In general, if you get lucky and get everything to work well, and can ignore the crappy port, it's not bad for a somewhat mindless romp through Renaissance Florence. But in the end, I probably wouldn't recommend it as one of my more favorite games.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was OK. After watching Videogamedunkey's review, I didn't want to finish it, but I had already bought 1-4. So now since I know that all the side missions are just repeats I am just going to play the main missions from now on. I only bought the series because of the low prices. It's one of those games that you don't want to play again, but you already bought it.			",110,10,1,6,4,0,0

												Others have succeeded where, thus far, I have failed.  I cannot recommend a game -- any game -- where the DRM prevents me from ever communicating with the Vendor.  I have repeatedly tried to get support for this problem -- Steam wipes its hands of it and Ubisoft can't seem to register my, er, registration.  Which is to say, no matter how many times I set/reset an account password with them, it never EVER works.  The ace kicker is that you can't communicate with support if you don't sign in so . . . anyone else see the problem here?Now, I've been gaming for nearly 30 years and I pay to play.  While I understand the claimed need, DRM doesn't have to be heavy-handed and intrusive.  It also should NEVER detract from the play experience.    So, I've tried for days and days to work this out and can't.  I petitioned Steam for a refund but, since I didn't immediately play the game right after purchase (it was a good christmas-NY's sale, after all) and the game wasn't the first on my play list -- they aren't having any.  Granted, I'm out less than $10 but it still . . . ah-hem . . . steams me.  I don't think there's much of a chance that I'll make any further attempts at playing anything Ubisoft might put out unless there is a lot of gamer-chatter that indicates they've learned their lesson.  And, Steam?  I'll be thinking twice before shoving anymore coin your way.  You didn't do the right thing.  Not at all.			",25,2,0,6,2,0,1

												Now don't get me wrong. this is a great game and i have many hours into this on console but the reason i don't recomend this is because this is a TERRIBLE port. It's pretty much as if they copy and pasted the Xbox version and just added keyboardfunctionality. The controls feel a bit akward  and there is lag even on low settings. The worstpart of the game is the cutscenes, i couldn't even make it to far sense the cutscenes lag so bad from the audio. Also, if you're buying this now, first goto Uplay.com and download the newest version, if not the game won't start up due to being packaged with the old version. Honestly, Ubisoft is just an awful company tht makes great games. AC2 on console = 10/10, on PC 5/10			",39,4,0,8,3,0,1

												Let me start by saying this game is fun [after I fought the DRM for over an hour]. Because the rest of this review can not focus on the game after the bitterness of getting it working. The game is fun, however getting it working is like doing taxes.Let me explain how this normally works. I buy a game; I play a game. I buy a game; I play a game. I buy a game; I play a game - see how well this works? It is like a perfect circle.I buy assassins creed 2. I get an immediate road block. I have to install uplay, update it, update it again, update it again, and again, and again. I am not being funny about this. It updates for about a half an hour. And when I say this I mean Uplay updates - not the game - the launcher. For 30 minutes or so.While this is going on I have been reading about this uplay system and Assassins Creed 2. Disconnects you in the middle of the game, Check. Breaks your saves, check. Unable to be played in offline mode, check. Have to make an account on another system, check. According to what I heard and seen much of this is finally fixed. [probably not.] During this process I have immidiately decided that this game was a bad idea and that I do not like buying games from ubisoft. They, in the first few minutes after buying this game and getting it ""installed"", have convinced me that I should be looking for a crack of somesort FOR A GAME I OWN. That I should move on to piracy methods to play a game I own without a hassle. Finally it is done updating - Wonderful! Now to make my account. I enter my account info and press submit. Uplay - No network connection. I go back to the video of an adorable kittty cat playing a keyboard on youtube... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Again? Same. Long story slightly shorter, I end up going to their site and creating an account. Finally! After a bit more futzing I start the SINGLE PLAYER game in offline mode. Check my settings. Press play and....No network connection. Ok♥♥♥♥♥♥on it. I ended up having to start the game in online mode before it would play at all. After this it would lett me play in [sort of] off line mode. Ok Ubisoft. I bought the game. I GAVE YOU MONEY. Why are you abusing me with this? I could have pirated the game, still very easy to do - Infact I almost grabbed the cracks during this just so I would not have to suffer any longer. At my customer hourly rate this game would have cost over $200 US dollars just to get into working order. Please justify that cost to me. No - no never mind, you can't.The game is great fun, if you can suffer through the uplay process. My advise is - Don't buy ubisoft games. They have gone insane on this whole ""pplz is steelin our gamez!"" kick. And software pirates are not the ones that suffer in the end. The legit buyers do. ",161,15,3,26,10,0,31

So far everytime I have tried to play it, it works for 10-30 minutes, then closes itself, and Uplay says ""Thanks for playing Assassin's Creed II"". Then it wont let me play anymore after that for more than 5 seconds.I really love the game and shouldn't have to go through the stupid Uplay crap.I do NOT recommend this game being played on the computer.

												Second game created in the Assassin's Creed series. Pros:+Good storyline+New weapons+New characters+Variety of missions+Retains original Templars vs Assassin's WarCons:-Somewhat complicated mechanics (you can't air assassinate a person 2m away and high from you)-Way too much water in Venezia-You don't go out of the Animus a lotConclusion:This game is really fun if you enjoyed the previous Assassin's Creed game with Altair. Ezio is the Assassin for this era, and the fact he has more weapons (gun blade, poison blade, second hidden blade, smoke bombs, etc.) means there are more ways killing people.

												Some game's age well, remaining entertaining and challenging long after release. ACII does not appear to be one of those games. The greatest challenges you'll face are not enemies or puzzles. No, the combat is laughably simple and the platform puzzles straightforward. Instead, the challenge will lie in the poor camera and loose controls. You will never die in combat, but you will die to jumping in a random direction many times. As for the story, it starts strong with good human interest and character growth, but quickly runs down the rabbit hole of JJ Abrams style mystery and conspiracy with no satisfying conclusion.The last 6 hours of gameplay I was gritting my teeth, forcing myself to finish this bloody game once and for all. It was not fun. It was repetitive and simple and frustrating. If you're debating whether to get back into the AC series after years away, I would strongly recommend against it. Read the wiki to catch up on the story and buy the latest sequel, if you absolutely must.			",50,8,0,8,0,0,3
