												This is one of the best entries in the lego series of games.  Every room has TONS of things to interact with.  The animations are done well for all the characters, or as the cool kids call them, minifigs.  Attention to the smallest details is seen right from starting the game, from differences in how Harry and Hermione Granger walk, to how Ron freaks out when using his wand.  You can play as everyone from the movies, from Malfoy, to Ginny, and even the professors.  All of Hogwarts is recreated from the big room they all sit in, to the dorms where they live.  Lots of fun abilities, like turning back time, make the same world seem new again.  There is ALOT of content in this Lego game, very impressive the level of detail.  Not being a Harry Potter fan I had a great time playing the game, and oddly like the game better than the movies.  Rating:  10/10  Value:  49.99			",2655,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												I absolutely love LEGO games!  Harry Potter films are awesome!  So i had to purchase HP1-4.  After playing a few hours I was hooked.  The single player campaign is great, story sticks to the films and there are a few comedy moments in the cut scenes.  The story takes a good 20 hours to do, but if you play “free play” you will get at least another 10hrs.   Free play gives you the opportunity to collect the secrets you couldn’t find first time round, plus great replay value.The gameplay is brilliant and multiplayer is just excellent.  I had so much fun having my boy’s play as a secondary character helping me collect all the items I need to get the 100% completion.  Great timesRecommend Highly ",65,22,2,7,2,0,4

												GAME BREAKING BUG!!!I was very much enjoying the game, despite some small bugs and odd design choices. That is, until the end of year 3. While solving a puzzle, the game froze and I was forced to hard quit. Thought it might have been from running my computer hard all day (it's a bit on the older side now). A few days later, went back to the game and had to redo that section (auto-save caught none of my progress). Then crashed at the same spot. Dug into the forums to discover this is a widely experienced and long existing bug without a consistent solution (i.e. multiple janky work-arounds that only work for some people). Work-arounds are also very involved and easy to mess up. It's wholly unacceptable to place that level of burden on the player, and very disappointing treatment of such a magical franchise. At the time of purchase, the game was ""mostly positive"" Zero, I REPEAT ZERO, of the auto-populated 'most helpful' reviews mentioned the game breaking bug. I am now left at a point where more than 25% of the game is inaccessible, but it's far enough in that it's beyond the Steam refund limits. At least I bought it during a sale, I guess. At 7 years old, I know they aren't going to fix/update/patch. the game That's fine and I wouldn't ask them to; I just think it should be pulled from sales or explicitly marked as broken so other people aren't misled or feel swindled.

												This is the most accurate Harry Potter game ever made. It has even secondary characters from the book that even if you're a big fan you might not remember their names, but they are there, and all of them are playable! The game has lots of places to visit and explore and even when you finish it, there's a lot of secrets to unlock. The gameplay is very easy, relaxing and addicting. The soundtrack is the same from the movies which makes the scenarios even more immersive because you instantly remember about the movie scenes when you listen to them. It's a ""must have"" for every Harry Potter fan.			",1204,500,76,128,128,16,153

												Do you like lego? Do you like Harry Potter? As a fan of both, I gotta say this is a great game. Lego harry potter is a simple, but fun game for all ages. I would recommend a controller to play, but keyboard works well too. You can play local co-op with a friend through the story.Years 1-4 means the first 4 books of Harry Potter, which includes: sorcerer's stone, chamber of secrets, prisoner of azkaban and goblet of fire. If you are too lazy to read up on the books, you can watch the movies. I would recommend doing both.Lego games are known to be very lighthearted and funny. Since I have watched the HP-movies hundreds of times and also read the books I see the change between them and this game. If you aren't familiar with HP, you'll probably miss out on some puns and references. They managed to make so many serious moments of the book into silly and crazy cutscenes.Graphics isn't great but the game is several years old. The lego ""style"" doesn't age as bad as some other types of games though, so it's acceptable and totally playable. Game runs great (unlike years 5-7) with everything cranked up to max at beyond 1000 frames per second on my gtx 980. No problems with that, however the game have some minor bugs.It surprised me just how long this game is! They actually included a lot of scenes from every movie. It felt like every movie was a game on it's own, which is great of course. When you get close the end of the game you might get bored though, because the gameplay is repetitive. Attack everything in every room, collect money and secrets, build objects, interact with them, go to the next room, and...repeat.If you like the lore of harry potter and you enjoy lego you will probably play this the entire way though. I enjoyed this game a great deal, and I like the less serious lego approach to the story. I think it shows that the developers are fans of the series themselves and really know how to retell the story.According to stats this game is about 13 hours long if you play main story, and 27 hours for full completition. I guess that makes me slow then, because it took me nearly 30 hours, and I missed a lot of collectables. I tried to search all rooms though, but I still missed things. Also, you can go back to levels with different characters to unlock certain things. Some characters have spells that are unique, which I thought was pretty cool.All in all, I really like this game and I think it was a relaxing and fun game to play. It looks okay, runs great and the gameplay is repetitive, but kinda charming. Devs managed to include all key plot points from the books and also a lot of extra. Now I just wish someone could make a good non-lego Harry Potter game, since the old licensed games don't do the HP-franchise justice.			",1471,589,50,140,180,18,243

												When the LEGO series burst onto the scene with LEGO Star Wars in 2005, it was an instant hit. The game's simple controls, fun humor, and family-friendly gameplay made it a classic among players and assured it a spot in the upper echelon of licensed games. However, as the LEGO series started branching out and extending its trademark influence across other properties, it seemed as if some of the spark had faded. The LEGO Indiana Jones games in particular were criticized for having numerous glitches and having a general lack of polish.When I started playing LEGO: Harry Potter, I had some serious concerns. However, it looks like Traveler's Tales has gotten back to doing what they do best with LEGO Harry Potter, and the love that they put into this title definitely shows.Right from the moment you start the game, the affection the developers have for the series as a whole is apparent. The opening cutscene features a mish-mash of humorous takes on the opening scenes from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone mixed with a few nods to both the fans of the books as well as previous LEGO games. I won't spoil anything here, but it must be said that the cutscenes in LEGO Harry Potter are definitely on par with the best of the cutscenes from the LEGO: Star Wars series.The cutscenes definitely continue the series' trademark humor, and the gameplay follows suit by providing users with more of the same puzzle-platform style of gameplay that has been featured in previous LEGO titles. Although this sounds a little disparaging, it's actually quite a boon for the game in this instance. The LEGO fanbase is one that must have some repetitious elements, especially when you consider that many of the players are quite young. Having a repetitious format may become tiresome in a game series designed for adults, but with a franchise with fans with single-digit ages, being able to hop right in and know what to do is key for success.That's not to say, however, that there are no new elements in LEGO Harry Potter. Instead of a single action you can take with items in game, LEGO Harry Potter features more than ten special spells that you can use to achieve various effects in the game. These spells can be easily cycled through using the shoulder button, and add a new puzzle element to the game.Although there are quite a few spells (including the always-funny Ridikkulus spell), the one you are most likely to use in 90% of situations is Wingardium Leviosa. This levitation spell is the first spell you learn and will be used to move objects around and interact with switches. The Lumos spell is also used quite a bit, along with various graduated intervals of attack-style spells including Expecto Patronus and Incendio.And speaking of combat, there is a fair bit of magic-based fighting in LEGO Harry Potter. This is a change of pace from previous LEGO games, but it sits nicely with the overall tone of the game. The Harry Potter series of movies and books has always been well-known for its magical creatures and (at least in the beginning) fantastical battle sequences. Although boss battles generally do contain some amount of puzzling, you will be able to fire off magical spells from your wand fairly easily to overpower your opponent.LEGO Harry Potter does a great job of refreshing and updating the LEGO series for the Harry Potter universe, but unfortunately, there are several problems that remain. One of the problems that returns from other games is the camera. Though you may not notice it if you are playing co-op and staying close to your partner, if you are playing with an adventurous partner or with a bunch of AI-controlled characters, you'll notice the camera following the wrong character or zooming out to the point of near-unplayability.Another thing that you must know coming in is that the best way to experience LEGO Harry Potter is with a friend. Playing by yourself can be quite an exercise in frustration, and AI-controlled characters can be painfully difficult to deal with, especially when you need to get them to a certain platform or area so you can proceed. Sure, you can always use your Wingardium Leviosa spell to get them in the correct position, but this can become quite the chore and make the game feel more like Hogwarts' babysitting service than a real adventure.A final complaint I have with this title is with the game's hub system. While hubs in previous LEGO titles have been expansive with plenty to explore, the Diagon Alley hub feels almost overwhelming. I had to search for several minutes just to find the character-purchase shop, and it felt like a chore going through the different areas, waiting for loading screens, and then tracking down who I needed to get new wardrobe choices, extra spells, or watch cutscenes. Though this may sound like a small gripe, I really relished the overall simplicity of previous games, and the complicated nature of the hub world just took away from the game's overall immersion.Technically speaking, everything in Harry Potter maintains the status quo, which is a good thing. Cutscenes look polished, and in-game graphics maintain the signature brick-style that has become synonymous with the LEGO series. The only quibble I have with the game's visual styling (and it is a minor one) is that environments can get a little too busy at times and it can be hard to be precise with your targeting when you have dozens of interactive elements on screen. However, this only occurs in a handful of areas, and can usually be remedied by walking up to whatever element you want to interact with and targeting it directly (instead of just heading in the general direction and pressing a button.LEGO: Harry Potter Years 1-4 is certainly the best of the post-Star Wars LEGO games. The story material is handled wonderfully (though if you've never read the books or watched the movies, prepare to be lost), and the gameplay is a great mix of familiar devices and new elements. Although the inevitable follow-up to this title may take a darker turn, I look forward to experiencing it all the same.Recommended ",1534,600,45,244,159,15,219

												This game brought back my childhood; and I can't decide which part I was more invested in as a kid. Harry Potter or LEGO? Or building Harry Potter with LEGO?Doesn't matter though because the game combines both and that on PC. Over ten years ago I started reading the Harry Potter books and I had been playing with LEGO already even before I could read. I used to beg my mother to take me to the movies to see HP and it was the one thing I was looking forward to the most all the years. I had folders at home with every little piece of information there was to collect in newspapers and magazines. I had posters all over the wall and watched the movies regularily. My friends and I even replayed some of the scenes in our garden. I went to the midnight release of HP6 in a bookstore when I was maybe 10 and there was a picture of me in the local town's newspaper since I actually dressed up. I ♥♥♥♥ing cried after watching HP7.2 in the cinema because it felt as if I was losing part of myself (I was 15 be considerate). My childhood seemed to have reached its end with no more Harry Potter movies being in production. And years later I found out about this game. For the love of god, I cannot properly describe my happiness.Loosely keeping to the movies it still generates the general mood of the (earlier) ones. There are a lot of fun moments and it's even more enjoyable when you've got a friend over to play it with. It even includes the original soundtrack which just hits you right in your chest whenever a new piece starts. For anyone having not yet played a LEGO game, you basically go through the chapters, sometimes being able to switch character, collecting LEGO money and shooting spells at everything you can point your wand at because, guess what, that gives you even more money. Later, when you replay a chapter, you can choose other people to play as who you unlock through the course of the game and who have different abilities and will let you enter new areas of the game.If you like Harry Potteror if you like LEGOor even betterif you like bothGet this game, it's so damn worth it!

												I'ma let you finish, but LEGO Harry Potter is one of the best games of all time. OF ALL TIME. This sounds hipster, but I liked Harry Potter before it was very popular. I went to go see J.K. Rowling speak in a tiny middle school gym, and she was the funniest, friendliest woman. It takes a special kind of person to be nice to a hundred yelling children in wizard costumes. For that alone, I'm willing to pay her some royalties by buying this game.Outrageously cute & funny. I don't have kids and I'm glad, because I don't want to share this total guilty pleasure, and also because that sounds suspiciously like effort.Pros:* Amazingly fun & absorbing. Moves quickly enough to keep interest high, but has enough replayability and hidden items that you'll want to explore the grounds for days. * Zero navigational difficulty. It's all very straightforward, and even when you're a little lost it works. They're new to the school, staircases change around, and Mrs. Norris is always there to * Changes as the years progress. The NPCs do different things, the classrooms change, and there are distinct feels to each year.* Child friendly. Fights are usually comical and there's zero gore. Cheats can be used from the get-go, which is nice for the younger audiences. Otherwise, you can earn dem cheats throughout the game as bonuses, which is also awesome.* So much fun. Just so much fun. An incredible interpretation of one of the best series ever written.Cons:* No achievements, this may seem nitpicky but I worked hard for that 100% & I want to prove to every single person that I have invested no time in ""life"" or ""meaningful relationships"" or ""personal hygiene"".* Crashes. I have a custom built PC and a high-end gaming top and both systems would crash. NEVER ALT-TAB. Don't keep other programs running while you're playing. Also, there is no cloud, so if you start a game on one computer, be ready to finish it on the same one.* Your friends will see what you've been playing on Steam and mock you. Whatever. No names, but some of y'all bought CoD: Ghosts. Don't you be judgy.			",237,235,1,35,1,0,9

												The Lego games are generally a reliably enjoyable experience, but this early outing suffers from the same problem that plagues most PC ports put together after the team has already moved on to other projects:  Crippling bugs that the devs will never bother to address. I've owned this game for many years now, and still haven't been able to finish it, or been willing to play Years 5-7, because crashes make it impossible to complete Year 3. It's simply unacceptable for a game developer to charge money for a game that a large portion of players literally cannot complete and never even *attempt* to fix the issue.If the CTD errors ever get fixed, I could give this game a solid recommendation, but as it stands, a large portion of the game is unplayable, and I can't recommend paying for that experience at any price.

												As far as LEGO games go, this game is definitely... well, a LEGO game.What I mean by this is that if you have ever played a LEGO game in your life then you already know everything there is to know mechanically about this game. In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard LOTR fan would tell you that the Lord of the Rings LEGO Games are the best.Overall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the ""latest and greatest"". Buy a flavor you love, and I promise you won't be disappointed :)			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												I was looking for a fun game to play with my wife. We are both Harry Potter fans. For the most part this game was fun to play with the exception of the crashes. We were playing with 2 Xbox 360 controllers and if you wander around into certain sections of the main lobby (The Leaky Cauldron) either one controller drops or both do. We found ourselves having to exit the game on several occasions because of this bug. But the gameplay and the humor (really need to have seen the movies) kept us going. That is until the dreaded year 3 glitch. It takes place on the roof during your attempt to free Sirius Black. Every time the game crashes as soon as you activate the first gargoyle. We tried the work around (see the steam forum) but every time it failed we would have to force quit the game. This left us bitter and raging as we have limited gaming time and no one wants to waste it on a game this buggy. I can't recommend this game at all even if it were free. I expected more from a LEGO branded game.			",160,27,1,26,11,1,36

Notes: Controller highly recommended!  This is my first LEGO PC game.  GINORMOUS spider warning!Options include fully-mappable controls, resolution from 800x600 to 1920x1080, and a variety of quality settings for graphics and effects.As someone who'd never played a LEGO PC game before, I found gameplay to be a bit confusing and overwhelming at first.  The key is to explore, interact with and/or destroy everything you possibly can, and collect every coin (aka stud) you see, as you'll need them for purchases later.There is no speech in the game - everything is communicated via tone of voice (""Uh?"" ""Uh!"") and character actions.  The LEGO HP games are based upon the movies, from the Fat Lady trying to break a crystal glass with her voice to the movie soundtrack.  I have both listened to the whole series of audio books (Jim Dale is an AMAZING narrator!) and watched all of the movies, so I am pretty knowledgeable about the world of Harry Potter.  I'm really not sure that these games would be as enjoyable for someone who isn't familiar with the stories, and they are of course FULL of spoilers!There are six chapters per ""year"", for a total of 24 levels to play.  Once you finish a chapter, you can replay it by going to the glowing board in The Leaky Cauldron (your home base, so to speak), and choosing it from the list.  You will NEED to replay chapters in Free Play mode in order to get all of the collectibles, as you'll need alternate characters that you won't be able to unlock until later in the game.There is also all of Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Nocturn Alley, and Gringotts to explore outside of the story levels.Cutscenes can be skipped once you've seen them the first time.Spells and Abilities:Your characters will learn a variety of spells as you progress, and though you can manually switch between spells, I recommend leaving it on ""pink"" (Wingardium Leviosa aka levitation) at all times.  First of all, your characters will automatically used the spell you need most of the time, and it's too easy to miss things that you need to interact with if you have any other spell selected.  Leaving it on pink will make a pink halo appear around anything you can use Leviosa on, which will save you a lot of frustration later.A lot of characters have their own special ability, so you'll need to switch between characters often.  A few examples:  Hagrid is very strong, Hermione and Ron have pets that can interact with the environment in their own way, Harry has the invisibility cloak, goblins have keys, dark wizards are the only ones who can interact with items that have red sparkles around them, Hermione can use the time-turner, sometimes you'll need to be a Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin to get past certain blockades... (Hello polyjuice potion!)Collectibles:- 167 character tokens (you'll have to purchase the ability to use them once you find the tokens)- 200 gold bricks- 50 students in peril- True Wizard (collect a specified amount of studs in each story level, which will earn you an extra gold brick)- 20 red bricks (allows you to purchase abilities/bonuses.  Pause the game, select Extras, then turn on the ones you want to use)- 24 Hogwarts crests, each consisting of four pieces: Red (Gryffindor), Blue (Ravenclaw), Green (Slytherin), and Yellow (Hufflepuff)- Spells to purchase at Wiseacres Wizarding Supplies (love that one that makes the person you hit turn into a human slug)Besides being a completionist, there are several other reasons to be collecting gold bricks:- Build special items in the basement of The Leaky Cauldron - one for each ""year""- Unlock vaults in Gringotts, which gives you access to challenge levels, which in turn earns you another gold brick- Unlock an extra level in Borgen & Burkes (have to have collected all 200 bricks!)The red bricks I mentioned above allow you to purchase some great abilities, such as stud multipliers, brick detectors, token detector, fall rescue (so helpful!), and more.  You can go to Wiseacres Wizarding Supplies and enter a cheat code to get these abilities if you haven't found the red brick/purchased it yet, but I personally did it all the hard way... I didn't even know how to turn the abilities on until after I finished the game. ;DAll in all, LEGO Harry Potter is a beautifully-done tribute to the world JK Rowling created, and Hogwarts was a true pleasure to explore.  There was a strong sense nostalgia with the familiar locations and the movies' music, but it was still fresh due to the way the stories needed to be adjusted to make the gameplay interesting.  I had no technical difficulties (unless you count the THREE items I cannot find to get my 100% completion, which is really a user-error), and I really had a lot of fun.  Absolutely recommended.

												Been slowly playing all the lego games with a couple of 6 year olds - and they've had the most fun on this one by miles! Puzzles, humour and plot seem less exciting for older kids than lego batman (1 and 2) or LoTR (I wouldn't say LoTR is that kids friendly at all) but going crazy and casting spells on every object you pass in Harry Potter is endlessly amusing for the younger ones. Age appropriate fun - for the young ones and Potter fans alike.			",1114,464,40,197,126,16,217

												This is my first Lego game experience, and to be fair, I enjoyed the first 2 years. And then I started Year 3, and things went to pot. Everything was running fine until the dreaded gargoyle glitch. After finally figuring out how to fix it (thanks to the steam forums), the game crashes every 10-15 minutes, and I have to restart the game. The only possibly way I can think of finishing the game is to rush through the levels so the autosave has a chance to save my progress before the next crash, which takes all the fun out the game.Good game. Bad bugs.			",63,5,0,3,1,0,1

												LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, combines the best of LEGO games, with the Harry Potter franchise to give you a fun title. Released in 2010, the game takes you though the first 4 books of the Harry Potter series; The Philosophers Stone(Sorcerer's Stone for US readers), the Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, and the Goblet of Fire. Several well known locations in the book series are available to visit in the game such as; Diagon Alley, the Leaky Cauldron, Gringotts, Hogsmead, and more. Explore Hogwarts, visit various classrooms to learn new spells, and unlock hidden secrets as you progress through the story. You even get to play Quidditch, and fly on a broomstick, so LEGO Harry Potter does not disappoint.You will explore the Harry Potter Universe, solve puzzles and more. I recommend playing with a controller on steam, as it seemed way more fun than with the keyboard and mouse. Even knowing the overall story arc, does not take away from the fun you can have playing Lego Harry Potter, so if you enjoy the lego games, and are a fan of the Harry Potter series, this game is a must have for your library. If you are new to lego games, I suggest finding a friend and playing with them, as you can 2-player co-op. An all around fun experience, I look forward to trying Lego Harry Potter: Years 5-7 as I've heard it is one of the best Lego games yet.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I have no clue what people are talking about with the bugs and crashes etc. Runs damn perfect for me and it's fun and enjoyable and I probably will never be bored with this and the 5-7 series also. If you get bored of playing the campaign theres always bonus things you can do like lego build games and bonus levels and just walking around diagon ally and such. Try this game out, I love it. Great game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okey, first of all there is a major issue with this game with the way it works and the fix is here: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1344121Now, the game itself is a lot of fun! I've not played too far into it, but it reminds me of Lego Batman 2. It has many of the same features such as Golden Bricks, Students in Peril (with batman it was citizens, which fits better as they really were in peril) and being a large open world where you ttravel mission to mission or spend most of your time unlocking new secrets.Instead of parts, you gain parts of the Hogwarts' crest to gain extra peices and you can unlock new students which may have interesting powers that will help you to unlock all the extras. This one doesn't have talking which makes me think it was made before Batman 2. Also, stud collecting in missions is a lot harder. I havn't completed a single mission yet where I filled up the stud meter.A very addictive game and I highly recommend it if you're a fan of the other Lego games, however the story (which is obviously books/movies 1-4) isn't told too well as there are parts that need to be spoken rarther than merely described through pictures and grunts so you'd only know what was going on if you had watched the movie and/or read the books.

												If you are looking for a game to play with your non-gaming significant other then look no further.  This game is awesome!  Hillarious, smooth learning curve, great mix of aciton and cut scenes, and challenges are interesting though not particularly hard.  It all makes for a very fun expierence.  Plus, the whimsical nature of Harry Potter lends itself well to legos.There are however a few issues that need to be overcome in order to play the game itself. In order of annoyance:1) Change your audio settings to 48kHz or lower or the game will crash every single time before it even loads.2) For the life of me I cannot get it to remember my graphics settings, so every time you open the program expect to take a seccond to set your resolution, vsync, AA, and other settings.3) To ensure stability, run the game in compatibility mode for WinXP.  I did not run into any issues personally, but it was suggested in several forums, and seems to be serving us well as we have not had any in-game glitches.4) As this is local co-op only then you will need 2 controllers, or be prepaired to have someone play on the keyboard... which is not a fun expierence.5) On the topic of controllers, it had no problem picking up the xbox 360 controller right away, but my 10 year old Saitek controller would loose it's key bindings on occasion.  It was rare, but if you plan on using a non Microsoft controller just be aware that you may need to rebind it from time to time.These issues are a bit of a pain when you are first getting started, but the game is well worth the extra effort.

However, from about half way through and onwards, the game became very glitching, constantly crashing, loosing controller connections with player 2, locked us out of free roam in Hogwarts and more including sound errors. If you have plenty of patience this might be okay, but it certainly takes away from a good and comfortable experience.			",56,2,0,0,1,0,0

												This is obviously one of the early LEGO conversions, I can grant and for give a lot of stuff as I've evjoyed the majority of their series.  One thing I REFUSE to is the game deciding to overwrite or wipe my save files a half dozen times while trying to play the game.  I have been forced to restart over and over again getting as far as 89.1% before it decides to start a new game under the ""Load Game"" selection.  I'm giving up and don't see myself returning to get a completed state.  If you can put up with this or are luckier than I, I wish you the best.			",442,83,7,62,20,2,69

												This was my second Lego game (I played the Hobbit first) and I was really surprised how they do not speak at all (which I liked, their humms and aahs and hahas were so funny!) I liked the SMASH EVERYTHING approach, the spells, the gameplay (you need a controler though). I laughed at the sequences -especially when Ron started to vomit Lego-snails. Since I've got not much experience with Lego games (yet!) I don't want to call this one ""one of the best"" but I enjoyed it very much, I played it nearly to the end (I'm still missing a few golden bricks but otherwise I managed to get everything) and I never got bored. Had a few good laughs, no laggs, it didn't freeze on me once and it never force-closed. Storyline is nice, for a game very well done and although the spells are the same with every char (except the dark wizards have one more or rather one is switched with another spell) and you really just need four chars to get through the whole game it's fun to be able to switch :)I bought it on sale, got HP years 1-4 and HP years 5-7 for together 10€ and I'd totally recommend buying them and enjoying some hours of good structured, well thought out and nicely made gameplay experience.

												Lego Harry Potter takes the harry potter films and adds a humorous twist to the established universe.The main type of game play involves going through different parts of the film's stories and solving puzzles. Given the audience this is aimed at, none of the game is particularly hard, it's more about the fun behind the play. It's worth noting that while this game supports single players, you may be better off with using the standard two-player mode.If you've played another lego film game, then this is in the same vein.There is no voice acting here, but the game does use the harry potter soundtrack. The graphics are fairly good in this game, with a mix of standard 3D game worlds interspersed with lego environments, all of which are destructible.I did encounter several crashes while playing this game, and this coupled with the very infrequent save poinyts makes for a very annoying experience. I narrowed this down to my laptop's power saving mode, which lends me to beleive that if your cpu is not being underclocked [as a powersaving measure] you should be fine.This game is worth a buy if you like previou lego games of the harry potter movies. If you're not a fan of those, then you should probably stay away from this.			",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

												This game has its moments, and for any Harry Potter fan can be a good time. However the port to PC was not done well at all and I came accross 2 separated clitches that either consistantly crashed the game, or created an impossible point to pass. After reviewing fourums online I was able to work arround both cases with some difficulty, but these issues have been reported for over 4 years so the developers clearly have no intention on patching the game. I wish I would have known the frustrations assositated with the PC version prior to purchase, as the glitch annoyances are not worth working around for a good (not amazing) game.			",19,6,0,1,2,0,0

												Some gamebreaking bugs on the Troll level due to an inability of the Devs to code the game properly. It's mighty hard to explain to a six year old why the game keeps crashing, and why she needs to constantly be redoing levels. I had to change the settings from a crisp 1920x1080p, ""all max settings"", to grainy low grade just to get past a level due to a technical error. A problem persistent in Traveler Tales games is that you're risking a buggy/sometimes inoperable game due to an inexperienced, lazy (they never go back and fix old bugs in their games), or incompetant department that handles bugs/crashes. The game itself is fun, and enjoyable. This is strictly a review on the operability of the game itself. Crashes/major bugs need to be fixed, otherwise it's a useless product.			",57,7,0,5,2,0,6

												GET A CONTROLLER OR DON'T BOTHER.I wanted that first in case it was the only thing you read. Yes, you basically need a controller to play this game. I played the first two years with just the keyboard and it was pretty much a nightmare. It's not impossible, but it is really annoying. I didn't realize how much work it was until I went and bought a controller, it became ten times easier instantly. Also I feel as if this game was made by two different people. On the one hand a lot of the visuals and level designs are amazing. I almost cried when I first got to Hogwarts, or I glimpsed the Quidditch World Cup. But then at times the levels are just unnecessarily stupid. There is almost no help the entire game to explain to you how you are supposed to do things. 95% of the time this is fine because it is overall a pretty easy game and kind of obvious how you are supposed to play. But then some of the time the only way to complete an objective is so mind numbingly abstract that you sit at the end of a corridor for an hour trying to realize that the only way to defeat a book is to become invisible (???).If you are a true Harry Potter fan this is pretty much a must buy even if just for getting to walk around Hogwarts. As a true dork I also loved figuring out which students were those barely mentioned characters such as Alicia Spinnett or Susan Bones. Of course true fans will also get frustrated with things like why Hermione tags along in the first task, or why Ron kind of sucks at flying a broom even though he's pretty good at it. But it's honestly worth any of the negatives to enjoy the positives.			",91,11,0,16,11,0,7

												This is a game I've been dying to play for ages, but always seems to be expensive for how old it is. Downloaded through steam as it's pretty cheap, but there are SERIOUS compatibility issues with the sound card, and I've also had to run it through compatibilty mode. Bit of a shame really. Worth it if you can get past the compatibility issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this originally for my son to play as he is a huge lego and harry potter fan.  However I have notched up a fair bit if game time on this now and can say it is money well spent.  I run it on Windows 8.1 with an xbox 360 controller and have no experienced any crashes or controller drop outs etc that other people have mentioned.  My kids have played it two player and I can assure you any crashes or problems I would have heard about it!  It plays brilliantly with great graphics and a comical side to it as you would expect from both the HP and Lego series.  The characters are charming and the story line has been tweeked here and there to fit in with the game but fans will recognise the story and all the scenery. I admit I did buy this when it was on sale but even at £9.99 to be honest I can not fault it.  Brilliant fun game that you can end up spending hours on - I mean that the kids can spend hours on :D If you are thinking whether to spend your money on buying the next installment as well (years 5-7) then I can also recommend that too.

												Pros- Landscape is quite huge with a lot of mysteries to be discovered- Follows the original story pretty damn well- Great functions such as local co-op but can also be played as a solo game- Feels like you embarked on a magical adventureCons- Got a local co-op bug. Unable to resume game when 2nd player pauses it. Have to exit the game and restart- No voice-over. Only muffled sounds and cut scenes which made it hard to figure out the story if you are not familiar with the storyline- Game allows free roaming. However, they do not have voice over so half the time I'm trying to figure out what to do next- Some items which you discover are meant for later stages in the game. There's no inventory so you have to leave the items for the time being (yet there isn't a voice-over to tell you that! so you might be walking around the room wondering what you missed)Overall, a pretty decent lego game for harry potter fans.

												Made For Consoles and a Terrible Port to the PC.This is a very buggy game on the PC.  If it didn't have so many problems it would be fun.  Unfortunately the game has parts that just fail to function (staircases in that fail to move..., rooms unable to enter...) forcing you to restart the whole game (which is bad when you are 75% done)  All this and also a tendancy to freeze forcing you to abandon the game.  I ended up tweaking the config files (although this would be considered a graphics problem but unfortunately there wasn't any way to to make these types of changes in the 'in game' options menu.If you want this game, I recommend you get it on console, in which it was clearly optiomized.  It is fun and has all the humor of LEGO games but I personally won't buy another LEGO game for my computer until I see they start fully supporting them with patches that fix game breaking glitches.

												I loved the Harry Potter books/movies/games, and just recently discovered the LEGO Harry Potter games. Though this game is definitely aimed towards children, there's plenty of fun to be had for the whole family c:Loads of replayability (especially for completionists; going back to earlier levels once you gain new powers/characters nets you even more loot)			",43,43,1,11,12,0,3

												I bought this game and the HP years 5-7 game for $5 each on a steam sale.  Totally worth the money I paid.  The story line is comical, the cut scenes are just the right size, and there are plenty of things to destroy.  In fact, almost every object in this game is interactive.  If you enjoy collecting things you'll definitely enjoy this game.  You start out learning each spell by going to classes and completing the task of testing out the spell, very similar to the movies.  Everything is laid out pretty much the way Hogwarts is supposed to be, so you'll backtrack through areas quite often, some times to finish up a room with a new spell but mostly to get to another area.  There is so much content that I'm positive you could beat the entire thing, and then go back through a year later and find all the secrets and unlocks.  There are golden blocks to collect, students in peril to save, hidden house puzzle pieces to find, and plenty of students/wardrobe styles to find.  After completion of the story line I had completed about 40% of the content, according to the game.  Much of the content I didn't get to involved dark arts spells that would require me to switch to a different character and replay the levels to get.I will say that exploding flowers or chairs or lanterns does get somewhat repetitive after awhile and I was torn between the need to collect all the tiny lego coins that pop out and just blazing through the level.  You should be able to get a good 20-25 hrs of gameplay out of this at minimum.			",101,6,1,11,6,0,5

												Just finished 100% this game with my wife.  We utilized the Steam Link to stream to our couch and played with a pair of xbox 360 controllers.Overall ImpressionsEven with the glitchy issues we still had a lot of fun with this one, ended up binge playing it over several days of bad weather.  Her and I have played to 100% on most of the LEGO games now, and I would say this definitely ranks as one of the top 25% of LEGO games produced (Marvel Superheros was our absolutely favorite).  If you are OK with dealing with some rather unfortunate bugs that seem to be in every LEGO game, this one is definitely worth the playthrough - took us ~18 hours to complete the game 100%, will probably take a little longer if playing through with kids.Pros Entertaining story missions. Lots to explore in Hogwarts. Great humor. Well balanced challenges - some tougher than others, but none so difficult that it was frustrating.Cons Numerous ""controller input missing"" glitches with 2 controllers hooked up. Particularly bad in areas where the normal split screen camera is disabled forcing both players to stay near each other.  The moment you walk away one person permanently loses control of their character forcing you to restart the game.  Happened at least a dozen times playing through the game. There is no ""Student in Trouble"" red brick to help find all of the students in trouble.  Everything else in the game has an indicator to help you hit that 100% completion except for students in trouble.  So if you end up like we did missing 1 of the 50 you spend a decent chunk of time trying to find that last one. Various other glitches, usually not game breaking, but in typical LEGO fashion there are definitely some weird things that happen. ",95,14,3,13,10,0,28

ALERT: I am a really big Potterhead!!! :-)I am a big fan of fantasy stories such as The Lord of the Rings,Eragon,The Witcher etc. But I am also a really huge fan of Harry Potter and everything connected to the world of Harry Potter. I have read all the books maybe more than 4 times. The whole story of Harry Potter is really something, what can't be beaten so easily. In my opinion, the story is really sad,heartbreaking, but also beautiful and phenomenal. J.K.Rowling-you are really a genious!This game is a true masterpiece, it has got so many things you actually can do.Exploring HogwartsUnfortunately nobody ever discovered a word, with which I can tell how great this is. The Hogwarts castle is really huge and there are a lot of hidden places. The exploration of the Hogwarts castle really takes a while, and I really enjoyed it.LEGO HumorAs it is usual in Lego games, the LEGO Humor is really well done. For example- the death of Cedric Diggory in the 4th year or Hermione been hit by Draco Malfoy with a cake in her face in the 2nd year. There are more funny scenes and I really like this.A lot of playable charactersThere is really a lot of characters you can play as. But for me I usually like to play as the characters from the Harry Potter books or movies which I liked the most.I really like Ginny Weasley,Ron Weasley,Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.Funny levels and a lot of collectibles around themI really like the levels, because they are really funny and I also like all the collectibles, that you can find in them. I also like, that the levels are made in their own funny way and they aren't even told same as in the books. But they still are really close to the actuall story as told in the books and I don't mind that they aren't ""copy-paste"" of the book versions of the story.Final verdictWhat to tell about this game? Well this game is really so great, that I really want to play at least 200h on it, because I really love it. Really awesome work from Warner Bros and Travellers Tales!10/10 ",19,2,0,1,5,0,5

												Unfortunately I am going to have to say ""No, I do not recommend this game.... for the PC"". I bought this on sale (luckily) so I don't feel like it's a complete loss, but if I had paid the full $20 to have glitches start very early on in the game I'd be OUTRAGED. I am disappointed because I was looking forward to this game and as I started playing I was having so much fun! Until I hit the part where you go into Harry's vault in Gringotts. I could only see a spell being cast, flames from some creature... basically just lights. I thought this was part of the game until no lights were fully switched on so that I could see what I was doing. I had to look up a walkthrough on YouTube and feel my way around to get OUT of that part. I even RESTARTED the game, got to the same point again only to find out it was still the same. I played further in (just a little) to encounter similar problems where I could get to one point and see everything just fine but moving slightly over or using ""Wingardium Leviosa"" on a light caused the screen to black out like it had before. I've read the negative reviews on this and I agree with them fully. This game is awesome, but BUY IT ON CONSOLE. Unfortunately for me, I do not have a single console, well other than SNES, to my name. Anyway... if you do buy for PC, just remember it's a risk. I will probably keep trying to play until I pull my hair out but that's because I still want to play.			",79,12,0,11,1,0,2

												One of the few co-operative games with coop Campaign.But I do not recommend it as HP1-4 is a really poor PC conversion.Major downsides:- Horrible load times - even when placed on RAM Drive- Contains bugs which will not allow to finish the game (you can not continue or there is immediate game crash)   (Some of such bugs documented by players, two experienced by me)- Issues with controller setting    (Lost settings, reproduceable freeze of one controller)- You have to enable achieved extras each sessionIf you want to play some game with your girlfriend/wife do not choose this game. After staring on load screen and repeated crashes you will be both annoyed...But still - the idea, graphic, story, fun and relax are in the game so perhaps newer Lego games could be a good choice.

												LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1 - 4What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's got that same LEGO charm and goofiness that we've all come to know and love since 2005's LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game. Parodying the first four Harry Potter movies (The Philosopher's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, and The Goblet of Fire), this game has the potential to bring new people into the Harry Potter fandom. It inspired me to watch the eight movies, and I must say that they're all wonderful. The puzzles in this game are clever, the satirical humor is an amazing thing to have considering how dark the movies get, and the idea of having the 'Dexter's Diner' and level select rooms as the Diagon Alley and Hogwarts Castle (respectively) overworlds are truly fantastic.But, I'm afraid I can't give this game a perfect score like I would for other titles in the series. LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1 - 4 falls just short due to one fatal flaw in the game: Game breaking glitches.In Year 3 Act 6, right near the beginning of the level, there are two switches that you need to hit to melt ice off a door to continue on. Hitting either of these crashes the game. But there is a workaround to it, thankfully. Just go into 2 player mode, place player 1 in a corner far away from a door, have player two hit the right switch, and have them drop out back to player 1. After waiting for a few minutes, do this again, but this time have player 2 take blind shots at the left switch, and then wait after you hit it. I know, it's convoluted and crazy, but it works. In the same level, there's a glass window that you need to break. The first time I tried to break it, the sound played but the entity in the map remained. This is fixed by a simple re-entering of the level, or restarting the game if you want to be sure. Just remember the glitch before that window.But in Year 4 Act 2....there's a huge problem. The third dragon you take care of, a blue one, is supposed to be raised up on a platform whenever you walk onto a certain spot on the walkway on his cage. Instead of working like he should, he instead falls right through the platform. As this is a glitch in the physics engine for the game, I kept trying again but had the same result. But one time the dragon went through the ceiling of his cage. And another time, he worked. BUT, the fireball that he shoots teleported as soon as it left his mouth, and hit the back left corner of the platform. I had heard that you, again, needed to go into two player mode to get this to work. The first time it almost did, but then he went through the ceiling again. Which is, admittedly, kinda funny. But the other two tries just had the same result as the first time I encountered this glitch. As of yet, I have not found a workaround or fix in the files to remedy this problem.Overall, I give this game an 8/10, and highly recommend it to any fan of Harry Potter, or the LEGO games in general. But, for the time being, I would also recommend that you get it in physical form just in case the above glitches are Steam exclusive. I will edit my score later on should there ever be a patch released for this game that fixes the above glitches.			",83,15,0,15,8,2,13

												LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is yet another LEGO game. This time riding on the first four Harry Potter movies. Released in 2010, made by Traveller's Tales, published by Warner Bros. It also came out for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, NDS, PSP and iOS.Out of ports the only notable ones are NDS, PSP and iOS ones. It's a different game, more like isometric exploration of small levels where you do quests for characters. While collecting studs.Technically, this PC version is known to be a pretty badly done. Actually, this game is full of glitches on any platforms. You can google out a whole list of them. It actually might be useful to check one out, to know what to avoid.Personally, I had no problems with this game. But I didn't try to 100% it anyway. I only once had trouble with making game recognise controller, so I had to restart PC. And it crashed once.But there are just way too many reposts of real nasty glitches. Some can't make it start without crash. Other experienced losing a save! And many also have game freezing in Year 3 on Dark Tower level when activating one of the gargoyles that shoot fire. I didn't had trouble, but I played this stage only once. But the solution seem to indiacate that it something to do with rendering dynamic light. You either activate it off-screen or change config file of a game. Just check on guides.As for gameplay itself, it's yet another Traveller's Tales lego game. It's like lego game, but with all stuff that lego sequels get. Be casual, have infinite lives, collect-a-thon, do simple puzzles. It's getting stale and writing Steam reviews on them is getting stale too.Actually, well, this time is different, because Harry Potter is the franchise I am familar with and love. Read books, you see. And then 50 years later I will be sitting with my kids and explain them how awesome it was. And then I will realize that everybody read books too and Warner is still making money with more Harry Potter stuff.Plot isn't all that changed. Lego figures still don't speak. So it's recommended to watch movies first, really. Well, okay, plot was changed a bit so there is always at least two characters to control at any time, so you can always have fun with a friend.And actually, I like this LEGO iteration. There are almost no annoying fights with respawning enemies which is a huge plus in these earlier LEGO games. It's more puzzle focused than that. I also actually laughed a few times. The world here is much more lively, combining levels and hub around pretty nice. You can even get another ""collectable"" - ""Student in peril"". Help somebody out of sticky situation and feel good about it. No more ledge jumping, more of spell-choosing and aiming. It also felt like I was restricted from less stuff in Story Mode than in previous LEGO games, you can get more stuff the first time around with what is given to you.Protip: To destroy the monster books, you have to come close and press Tag button for some reason.Eh. It's nice. For me this whole Lego franchise got stale, as I tried to beat it in chronological order and beat Star Wars, two Indiana and the first Batman. But for those who didn't play much of Lego games this one will be nice. Actually, looking at it again, it is good as part of franchise too, as I realize that I had less frustration due to Lego Harry Potter having less respawning enemies. But watch out for all the glitches!			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1 - 4 can go by rather quickly if you just do the story without bothering any of the stud collecting or exploring, because they really do strip down the plot of the films, which it's clear TT was using as the basis in direction, not to mention the WB logo.But it's a LEGO game, it's fun, creative, puzzling, unique in level designs, which is saying a lot for a company that has been making LEGO games for quite some time now. The fact that LEGO games can still feel refreshing is remarkable, especially when you're not a child but an adult. The fact that TT is able to accomplish all that is profound to some degree. And with each LEGO game, the smoothness and world building improves with each one. I know more recent LEGO games have had larger open worlds as their hub and with Harry Potter, or at least this one as I've yet to play Years 5-7, the hub is Hogwarts, and to an extent, The Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley. At the Leaky Cauldron, you have the classic hub set up where you can find extras and go shopping for upgrades in the Alley, meanwhile at Hogwarts, you follow the story and explore when possible. The one aspect of exloration in Hogwarts that I didn't find remarkable was how confined or limited it felt. There are only a few areas to go to and it's not like there are side quests that will want you to stick around, you'll probably just beat the story and uninstall the game, kind of like what I'm doing now.Anyway, it's still a good LEGO game.8.3/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												It didn't take more than 10 minutes until I was in tears of laughter, maybe it was not intentional from the developers' side but♥♥♥♥♥♥I have been having fun with this. Bought it 75% off and that price might suit it better than the original, but honestly whichever price it has been bought for I think it's worth it. I have been playing for quite a few hours and I'm still highly entertained. Not even half-way done! Lego games knows how to make their games for every ages, and even as one in my early twenties I have fun with Lego games. Not a difficult game at all but the characters interactions and the small secrets everywhere makes it all very satisfying.			",6,7,0,6,4,0,1

												I love this game. I absolutely adore it! It has all of the brilliant elements that make up a good lego game. In addition Harry Potter is one of my favourite franchises. So why do I not recommend it? Well, in its current state (and for the unforseeable future), the game is riddled with bugs. I have probably experienced around 15 crashes so far, and they appear at random. If it happens during a level, you lose all of your progress. It is insane that Steam allows this to be sold in its current state. It is broken.I would say maybe buy it on sale if you love Harry Potter.			",12,3,0,8,1,0,1

												Lego games have been a huge sucsess thanks to those who worked in Lucus Arts for years, they have worked all the way from Star wars, Indiana Jones, to Lord of the Rings..When i first played this game, i thought to myself ""why am i playing a game ment for little children?!"" And now i know why.I grew up with the idea of legos being the ultimate building block of this great thing called imagination, creating a never ending awe of possibillities.The fact is their are many people, like myself that grew up on Harry Potter..I first began reading it at the age of 10 years old, and to my amazement i hounestly would say i have never felt so enchanted to read something that made me as a little kid, want to read... and more....This game is enchanting, it does yes... have a few quorks and whistles but the sheer andenture you embark as harry makes you forget the problems.This game truly makes you laugh, with its small adjustments to the storyline to make it more fluent dosn't ruin the story and makes you wanting to play it more as every new chapter unfolds..Harry, Ron and The great hermione have their own abbilities that in the movie made them memerble in the books...The enviroments are wounderfull and fill your heart with excitement. The music is from the films, and does at times seem way too over used, but is greatly anc crafted in a good matter in the game to give you a priticular mood to earch chapter and event. The gameplay is smooth, and easy.. witch is great for kids and interested party's.The game itself makes you remeber why you loved the books, and the films... the game itself is a treasure as well.I recomend this game to you all, Harry Potter fan or not, if you are brave.. enjoy a story made from the heart about the great joys of love and true freindship... then you will enjoy this game			",19,3,0,7,0,0,0

It's a shame because it was a well thought up game, however i can't recommend this game if it is a bug with the gameplay. It always freezes at the same time.If this bug was to be fixed i'd recoment this to any Lego and Harry Potter fan. :)			",215,84,2,19,30,1,13

												Very good game, but the glitches ruin it. I ran in to a glitch in Hagrid's Garden, and the game won't let me leave the area. I tried leaving the level, but trying to continue the story brings me back to that point, where the building feature glitched. The only option now is to RESTART MY ENTIRE SAVE FILE. Needless to say, this is quite annoying. Can we at least have a way to force restart a level? Deleting five minutes is a bit annoying, deleting hours is rage-inducing,			",46,6,0,15,5,1,4

												I loved this game...until I couldn't save anything. I had played it for about an hour or so when I first got it and when I decided to quit the game is when the problems started arising. After restarting the game and attempting to save it multiple times I looked it up online to see that it's quite a common problem. I ended up having to refund the game seeing as none of the solutions that I found on the internet that supposedly fix the game worked for me. If they were to fix that issue, and the other ones I've read in the reviews experienced by other users I'd gladly buy the game again as it was so much fun.			",23,14,0,2,1,0,0

But it has one down side: it has to be played with a controller, don't bother with a keyboard. It is not made to be played with a keyboard. Unless you want to challange yourself and play both characters with the keyboard at once.			",77,24,1,17,14,0,16

												My review will be based in a few things:1 - I Love Hairy Petter and Hairy Petter games2 - I Finished 100% of the game3 - I've played with an Xbox 360 controller4 - I'm not a native english speaker5 - This is my first reviewLet's start õ/Like I said, I love Harry Potter and I kinda like Lego games... so this was very interesting.Graphics:Nothing special, but they have done a great job recreating the cenario7/10Cenario Immersion:Sometimes it feels empty, almost no interaction with the castle except for the parts that you must interact to continue the game. There is not that much places that you can go, but still made me feel disoriented and I've made myself a mental map to know where was i. Even knowing that there is not that much to go, they made it in a way that i almost didn't care, which is nice.7/10Story:They've cut a lot of the 4th year... the whole ball... NOT EVEN A CUTSCENE DDD:Well, frustrations aside, they've made some changes from the original movie(s) just to make it ""comic"". I know this supposed to be a kid's game, but Harry Potter story isn't something very... kids safe... but... well, ♥♥♥♥it. Like i was saying, those changes doesn't affect the story that much and some changes had to be made to save time and not to make the game too long, but all the other parts were quite accurate.8/10Gameplay:AI sometimes can ♥♥♥♥ you up, but is very well programed for the other parts, and if you play this game as it should be played (no exploits nor glitches) you'll have no problems with AI. Even in parts where two players need to separate in order to complete a puzzle.AI 7/10The controls can give you a hard time if you want to finish this game quickly... the spell selection is kinda of confusing and messy (Xbox 360 controller) but... you get usued to.Control 7/10The spell detection sucks... you want to cast a Leviosa on a purple thing and then you are levitating Ron. To kinda ""fix"" this, they've made a manual target. But still... even with the target on the purple thing, sometimes it doesn't recognizes the object's purple aura.Spell detection 3/10Character control is fine... not perfect due camera angles and some leviosa's sensitivity, but it does the job.Character control 6/10Action detection: i don't know what is worse, spell detection or action detection... when you want to put the skelleton arm in the cauldron, you have to be almost inside the ♥♥♥♥ing thing... when you want to use your pet two passes away from the cauldron, you get teleported to the ♥♥♥♥ing cauldron...Action detection 2/10Overall gameplay 7/10Sound:Can't tell a lot, but the soundtrack is like the one in the movie(s). BUT it doen't have a big collection, so you hear the same music in Hogwarts over and over and over and over again. I like the music from Harry Potter, but who isn't a fan and really pay attention to soundtrack is going to get bored really quick.Sound effects are ok, not much variation either.7/10Extras:This is where i've spend the most time playing. There are a lot of things to collect in Hogwarts and if you want to complete 100% or not, i really recommend getting at least all character tokens. It makes you explore the whole castle and see all the other parts that were really well done and with a lot of details. Some parts of the castle you wouldn't even know it exists because just playing Story Mode doesn't give you the complete hogwarts experience.There are some collectibles that are really a pain to find (Students in Peril) and if you want to get 100%, you have to play the game twice (one in story mode and one in free play).9/10Other things:A few glitch here and there, but nothing serious. EXCEPT for the save file. This is the worst type of save system that could exist. I've said that you have to complete the game twice to get 100%, well, i've completed 6 times because of the poor checkpoint system, only one save file that is easily corruptible, no cloud save, file location is ""hidden"" and you can't force a save... only when you get a token, get a golden brick, a red brick, save a student or finish a story sequence. I've got so frustrated the first time that i was 82% and then all the sudden, my save got currupted. I've waited another holiday season to play it again. If you are trying 100%, I recommend creating backup files every time you see the auto save icon.This is easy a 5h game or 22h 100% game.Overall:It's a nice casual game that makes you want to complete 100% and gets you addicted quite fast. Even with this save problem, the game is well done in general and i had a lot of fun playing it alone.I recommend this to a Lego games fan or a Harry Potter fan.7/10			",101,13,2,11,3,0,2

												I really enjoy this game, but it is really buggy. Lots of crashes, sometimes game-breaking. For this reason, I must not recommend this game. It is fun to play, one of the best Lego titles, but unless you are willing to restart regularly, and/or are extremely lucky this game will try your patience.			",62,22,0,19,13,1,9

												To start, let me tell you where I am in the game: I am at the start of year 2 in the level ""Floo Powder"". Year one was great and I found no bugs or anything that went wrong. However when I go to mini games, I notice that the second one requires 2 players. Naturally I try to play as both by ""press F2 or any button to start"" THIS DOESN'T WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SECOND DEVICE CONNECTED. The game doesn't crash but it makes it unplayable as it will take you to the escape menu which you can't navigate as you are now ""player 2"" and using a controller. Back to the level which I am currently on. Or more like stuck on. Indefinitely. Near the end of the first section when you are in the Weasley's bungalow, you must acquire Ginny. Now I have done everything on this level and still hadn't found her and you are unable to go upstairs where I thought she'd be. Naturally after about 10 minutes of looking, I went on youtube and found that  she should be in the back cabinet next to the door to the garden  . I had opened that about 8 minutes ago and she is nowhere to be seen. Nothing else can be completed on this level apart from Fang digging in one corner of the garden.I will update this review as I progress through the game TL/DR: Keyboard controls are awkward even after rebinding, lots of critical bugs but no crashes (which in this case is necessary as the gameplay is impossible)  ",329,106,7,26,40,1,26

												Highly recommended for fans of the Harry Potter films (and books too) and fans of the LEGO games. It is everything you expect from a LEGO game, from the silly little jokes to the frantic collecting of studs. As always, the abilities you unlock later in the game allow you to do cool stuff in the earlier levels, so you can play through the game multiple times! (This might also be a downside if you want to 100% the game but don't want to invest time into it). Overall, I would say together with Years 5-7 these games are the best Harry Potter games on the market. 8/10.			",142,35,2,12,12,3,21

												Defo reccomend this game! :D I absolutely loved playing it from start to finish as i am a massive fan of HarryPotter watched the films multiple times and never get bored of them, love the series! :D In this game you play through Harrys first 4 years which do follow the movies but with LEGO charm/humour here and there which we all know and love! Building with magic, lessons to get new spells etc. anything a HP fan would wish for really to have in a game and i just had a blast smashing up objects with my wand around Hogwarts, so fun! If your into HP, i would strongly reccomend you play this as you can literally relive your favourite moments if your new however, you should give it a go when it goes in sale and maybe you will make some new favourite moments! =)  However, there is 1 problem that i need to address which im sure many of you are aware of which is the Dark Tower level on Year 3 where when you shoot the gargoyles after watering the plants, the game wil crash. To fix this you can go into pcconfig, explained here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/21130/discussions/0/541907867766148247/ Or like i did, work your way around it which is: to get Hermione off screen away from Harry so in the corner as you drop down worked for me (this is when he is near the Gargoyles) get her to have Crookshanks out, quickly change to Harry, shoot the gargoyle(s) (i did one at a time as 2 of them) then quickly change back to Hermione as apprently, the animation causes it to crash so it can't crash if camera is on Hermione. Thanks to people on here and YouTube for these solutions as i really did not want to have to end at year 3 XD now Years 5-7 for me :D   but i will come back to 100% this game at somepoint! =)			",256,49,10,21,13,3,14

												This is a fun game for anyone who liked Harry Potter and is familiar with the story/movies. Yes, there are some technical issues sometimes (game minimizing itself is one of mine), but I've never found them to be so invasive that I couldn't enjoy the game. The graphics are actually quite nice, the levels are big and there's lots to explore, and the characters are fun. I love the dialogue-free thing (who REALLY likes sitting there for five minutes listening to dialogue when you've already read the subtitles?) and the fact that there are little jokes put in from time to time that provide some nice comic relief. This game tends to keep you in a good mood because of its humour and the fact that it isn't extremely difficult. As far as I can tell, it is very, very hard to die in this game (at least in the first few levels--I can't speak for the later ones as I haven't played them yet), so that provides some relief for gamers who are reaching the end of their patience after getting killed dozens of times on the same level of their favourite more difficult games. You also seem to get a lot of reward for a little effort. Run around hitting things with spells left and right and you're amply rewarded with coins. In these ways, LEGO Harry Potter is definitely a kids' game but not so much that an adult who loves Harry Potter can't enjoy it, especially an adult who doesn't always want to be stuck playing the typical violent, bloody FPS all the time.I can also see how this would be fun to play with a friend if you have a controller or two. The multiplayer option is always there--you don't have to play any special mode to enjoy co-op play--so your friend can jump in to help you out (or make things more difficult, depending on the friend) anytime.All in all, I would definitely recommend LEGO Harry Potter to anyone who likes the series. It's purely a fun, enjoyable game with nice little jokes thrown in. It'll make you smile and give you hours of fun for not too much money.			",263,91,7,43,89,2,55

												I've played two lego games so far: LOTR and HP. I must say LOTR is awesome action pack and I love it whereas HP in my opinion was boring BS. I gave Harry Potter 90minutes and as a fan of the series I really tried to like the game. I played it with xbox360 controller it's one of the rare games where keyboard is actually worse, mainly because mouse has no function. So everyone playing lego games controller is THAT much bettter.The first 90 minutes made me first of all hate the coin collecting. First I thought you need to collect them to be able to buy stuff. I still don't know if you can buy stuff, but I hate destroying everything and collecting the coin explosions. Tbh I think there is no actual benefit for it other than 100% completion.I was able to learn the first levitation spell at my first magic class and the spell system is not my cup of tee. I think holding X and aiming a crosshair at some torches and bookshelves and whatnot is kinda lame. The character switching is stupid when the inactive character always runs back to harry potter (who is rarely playable and useless character mostly during my 90 minutes in). The extra characters would be fun I guess with friends to co-op, but they really should follow you around rather than returning to room/area entrance which in some cases is very far away.The puzzles were pretty boring especially levitating bits and pieces and most of all Scabbers puzzles were lame. Students in peril... LAME. I didn't get into any real action except for pulling chains and opening locks... and collect more coins. I would also like to have character names visible since these lego guys aren't always that recognizable. That was more of a problem in LOTR with the four hobbits, but also a negative in HP.I bet it gets more interesting after more hours, but for me this game did not deliver. And I may compare too much to LEGO Lord of the rings that delivered instantly and was action packed action game with real voice actors. Potter characters speak gipperish and made it childish and ruined the fun for me. Even the LEGO jokes felt awkward with Harry Potter mumbling. The jokes do work in LOTR when there is real voice acting and the atmosphere in cinematics is fantastic.On a scale 0-5 I would give harry potter 1.5 and LOTR would get 4.			",137,48,3,9,11,4,19

												My complaint is simple - this is a bad port. Playing this game without a controller is all but impossible. If you have a controller, it's ok, but still it doesn't have much of what you would expect of a good game on PC. Also a big disappointment for me was lack of voice acting. Maybe it's characteristic for LEGO games in general, I don't know (I bought this one for my kid only because it was Harry Potter), but here you are:- not playable without a controller;- no voice acting;- more than a few liberties taken with the plot and the universe of HP.If you are ok with all of the above, go ahead and get it. It does have a fair share of content. But try to get it at a discount.			",105,71,0,16,11,0,19

												First, I love the LEGO games, I also like the Harry Potter universe, but I am disappointed with this one. This may look like a fun game, but in fact this is only a poor port of the PlayStation version.It is IMPOSSIBLE to play the game without crashing points. After a year I decided to try playing the game again. New computer, new system, and the game still crashes at certain points. I tried playing with the edited gameconfig file, I also tried changing the sound quality under 48 kHz, I tried the default settings, I also tried compatibility mode, even with admin mode, but nothing helped that I've found on forums. There are some critical points in the game, and if you are not lucky, the game WILL crash whatever you try and can't continue. Read the forums, they are full of bugreports and publisher doesn't do anything to fix them.I've downloaded a 100% save (couldn't find 20% that I needed), but the game is not the same, nothing to explore, can't enjoy with that anymore.Don't waste your money on a game that only causes headache later. This could be a good game, but this is the only LEGO game that WILL crash and won't let you finish the story... :(			",302,70,7,15,26,3,55

												My wife and kids like it, but I find it repetitive. (Don't tell my wife) Reason I find it repetitive is that every level you run around blasting things with spells until eventually you either find something to build (with another spell) or find the potion ingredients to enable you to move on. Does have some good cutscenes that manage to be funny even though the characters never say anything, but you would probably have to be familiar with the books or movies to get them.

There is a bug with the graphics and a few of the animations that causes the game to crash though. But there's a fix for it located in the forums, so it's really not too big of a problem.

												As others have said, a fun game and one of the best in the Lego series. Unfortunately it is completely unplayable. Crashes out every 5-10 minutes. I didn't even get to finish the first level (lucky players who only report this issue from year 3!) I've checked the forums and it seems that this is by no means an uncommon problem. Some fixes have been recommended (including changing the settings on your sound card) but none of these worked for me. This game has been out for a long time and this problem has never been solved.Steer well clear, and if you want to play buy it for Xbox instead. This is a terrible, broken port and you may as well throw your money away as buy it. Real shame as the game itself (having played it on the xbox) is good fun.			",278,139,2,45,46,0,55

												For a lego game it is what you expect, a fun time with Lego and lots of mini puzzles and things to find to proceed.Good game overall, with some problem solving to make potions and open doors to proceed.Lego games are not for everyone, but if you like them then I recommend picking up this (if you're a Harry Potter fan) or another series which you may like. Warning: On year 3 Level 6, there is a troublesome glitch which will CONSTANTLY stop you from proceeding, but you can look up a way to get around it easily... A little frustrating but you're able to pass it.			",108,35,2,18,6,2,5

												As others have said, a fun game and one of the best in the Lego series. Unfortunately it is completely unplayable. Crashes out every 5-10 minutes. I didn't even get to finish the first level (lucky players who only report this issue from year 3!) I've checked the forums and it seems that this is by no means an uncommon problem. Some fixes have been recommended (including changing the settings on your sound card) but none of these worked for me. This game has been out for a long time and this problem has never been solved.Steer well clear, and if you want to play buy it for Xbox instead. This is a terrible, broken port and you may as well throw your money away as buy it. Real shame as the game itself (having played it on the xbox) is good fun.			",278,139,2,45,46,0,55

												Finished the game to completion, although it was a close thing. Game has lots and lots of bugs, and crashed several times (even requiring a hard shutdown of my computer). It's very annoying to have to redo levels several times. This game involves a lot time wasting actions to make the game longer. It does follow the movie quite well, but without talking the scenes can acctually be pretty annoying (they make odd grunting sounds). Once you're in, you feel the need to complete it, but it might be tough with the crashes and boring redo requirments.Pros:follows moviecheap on salecons:crashestime wasting actionsno voice acting			",14,30,0,3,7,0,4

												As of right now, I don't think I can recomend this. I was a huge fan of the Lego Star Wars games on PS2 and Gamecube and those 2 games hold some of my finest co-op gaming memories. My girlfriend hasn't seen any of the Star Wars movies but is a huge Harry Potter fan, so I decided this would be a tremendous pick for co-op.However this game is missing... well; almost everything I enjoyed about those Star Wars games. It's very slow, the puzzles arent interesting and instead of combat, gameplay seems to mostly consist of collecting junk from high shelfs and throwing them into a pot. I'd rather be fighting death eaters, platforming accross moving staircases and stealthing through hogwarts in my invisibilty cloak. Or something like that.Only glipse at a real combat so far was when I had to fight the troll in the bathroom and for a second it felt more like the HP game I was expecting. But if the only exciting parts of this game are the climaxes from the movies, this game won't have alot to offer, as by that definition there will only be about roughly 4 exciting sequences in a game that I'm guessing should take 6-8 hours to get through.The rest of the time feels like most of what they cut out of the movies. Although Hogwarts is a charming, magical cute place, it's still a school like any other where you're dredging between once class and the other, not terribly excited to get where you're going. The movies had the sense to let this happen off screen but this game seems to use it as padding but then again, the whole game feels like padding.I'll edit my review if the game gets any better before my and my girl get to the point where the game apparently breaks.

												I was really enjoying it up until the end of year 3, and then it would freeze at the exact same spot. Turns out because of an update done years ago, the game can't handle a specific animation, and you have to do ridiculous work arounds to get past that point. Whatever, did the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing workaround. Now, I am at year 4 chapter 2, and can't even get the level to load without it just going to a black screen that I can't even alt+tab out of (meaning I have to restart my whole computer), so I can't finish the game. The game came out six years ago, so there is no chance of Traveller's Tales of ♥♥♥♥ing fixing it. And, since I've had it longer than two weeks and played it more than two hours, I'm not elligible for a refund. I heard the console version isn't broken, so I'll probably pick up a second hand copy of it once I'm done being mad about this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.♥♥♥♥ you, Traveller's Tales. Eat♥♥♥♥♥♥and choke on it.

												As a huge Harry Potter (and lego) fan I was delighted to find this game. I've spent hours and hours finding every last golden brick and character. Sadly steam won't show my real playtime, since most of it was offline, but I'm guessing I've spent around 40 hours on this game. I've had my share of problems and bugs, playing with an xbox control was a pain in the butt sometimes as the connection would just drop out, and the game would glitch really badly if I used spells too fast. Despite this I really recommend this game to anyone; Potterfan or not, because this kind of game where no one speaks a single word is fantastic. And Voldy is hysterical. (too bad Ron is useless. Hope he'll catch up in 5-7)			",39,26,0,17,29,0,5

												Well then. So I thought I'd buy Harry Potter to kill some time after work. So far what I've experienced is that it crashes randomly from time to time with no reason. Just saying not responding. I can play for a good hour, no problem but sometimes when you're already into it so long and have not reached a save point it really does my head in if it just crashes. The game in general is fun, the mocking is genius. The crashing really makes me not want to play it anymore. Some maps are hard and kinda sucks it's not easy to get a hint out of them, just an FYI.

												This is a port of a console game from 2010. The controls are alright, it's buggy in places, and it looks a little outdated. But the Potterhead in me couldn't put it down. Even after completing the game, I had to go back and find all of the extra easter eggs, unlock more characters, etc. I definitely recommend this to fans of the Harry Potter books and/or movies - otherwise, probably not worth your time or money.

												Released six years ago and still contains several obvious bugs, from graphical glitches to almost game-breaking ones such as the second game-controller disconnecting. From my experience this will happen every single game (sooner or later) and then you'll have to either restart the game or continue playing with the keyboard.The game-play itself is mostly some strange reinvention of 90's adventure games' mechanics, where you have to explore the cartesian product <thing you have> X <things in the level>, trying to figure out which magic combination the developer intended for you to use this time.An example: Suppose you're in a clearing in a forest and you need to reach a high ledge. What do you do? Simple, just follow this easy guide and you'll be on your way!1. Find a gray cylinder-shaped lego piece.2. Using levitation magic, lift it up into the air.3. The cylinder will split into five separate disks. Why wouldn't it?4. Use these disks to form a shape, sort-of resembling a rain-cloud.5. Levitate the pieces over that old tree next to the clearing.6. The ""cloud"" will start to rain. (Why do I have to tell you this?)7. Water will make the tree grow (Duh!). Super-fast. In the middle of the night.8. As the tree grows, tree-pixies (or whatever) will sprout out from it. You DID see that coming, right?9. The tree pixies will build you a ladder! Problem solved!It's so simple you'll be kicking yourself that you didn't think of it in the first place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought LEGO HP 1-4 in the Steam sale yesterday (18/09/2014), installed fine, but it crashes instantly when it starts every time. The error message I receive is "" Fatal Error! Failed to create d3d device. Application will now exit. Error = 0x8876086c"". I have triple checked my graphics drivers are up to date (ATI Mobility Radeon HD5470), I have tried various fixes that are on forums etc, even the audio fix, and the fix to adjust the config file for the games resolution on start-up. But nothing. Nothing seems to fix this problem. I have never had this problem before, all my other games work 100% and LEGO Lord of The Rings works 100% every time. I downloading a Lego HP 1-4 demo to see if I got the same problem and YES it has the exact same issue so it's nothing to do with Steam. I also bought years 5-7 in the sale so I will install that and see if I have the problem with that game, too.[UPDATE] LEGO Harry Potter years 5-7 works 100% perfectly fine (although 720p it wants only to run windowed? which is weird) anyway, this clearly shows that Harry Potter years 1-4 has something terribly wrong with it, maybe it hates Windows 7? maybe it hates Radeon cards? I don't know. But I also found out that these games have no dialogues and the characters just make noises.... which is horrificly annoying. Even though 5-7 works 100% because of the awful lack of dialogue I just find it completely unplayable			",93,15,0,4,8,0,2

												Very vanilla game with a lot left out. Somewhat enjoyable if you've watched the Harry Potter series. There are some clever jokes in the cutscenes, but the gameplay is repetitive. So unless you enjoy destroying random stuff on the easy difficulty, you probably won't like this game.			",79,28,0,13,12,0,2

Multiple times one of the characters has been bugged to a place where they shouldn't be, and maybe can't get out of (This can be fixed by leaving the room, mostly). It has crashed a few times as well, which can be a bit annoying but I can live with that. Right now I can't complete an area because an item is stuck.

												Best part about this game is that you always have two characters even playing single player (since there's no reason to play  this co-op), and most of the game the companion is Hermione, and I had her do everything as Harry Potter did next to nothing but follow her, while Ron did absolutely nothing, much like he did in the original books. Hermione was the real hero of Harry Potter anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game to play it with my younger sister, expected a good co-op platformer with some action and puzzles thrown in the mix, above all , I expected a fun, well thought out package. This game is really far from fun, it seems that cuting development costs was their number one priority. The gameplay mechanics are so offensively simple that I don't see anybody enjoying themselves while playing it. And don't be mistaken, it's not like they simplified the game in some areas in order to appeal to the younger audience, no. They simply designed this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥without any depth what so ever, none. It's just so plain and so unintuitive in everything it does. It became so basic in the ways it approaches things that there's no enjoyment to be had once you actually manage to complete a level. Flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broomstick doesn't feel any different to walking.There's no point in using your brain at all while playing this game, in the end you'll still be forced to just run around for a minute or two, smashing everything around you in order to get enough scrap to build the thing that can help you proceed to the next room. There's nothing smart about it, nothing clever. In their efforts to secure the highest profit margin possible they produced an experience without any substance, just a long, tiring series of corridors, fetch quests and weak -♥♥♥♥♥HP references. If you're looking for a engaging expereince to enjoy with your youngsters, please, PLEASE, look further, avoid this game at all costs, even if you are a fan of the HP universe.			",10,2,4,2,2,0,0

I tried reloading and nothing got rid of this bug- I needed to restart from the beginning in a new save, and this wouldn't be fun. Second, the gameplay is not what I expected. You're using your keyboard like a controller- you can't even use the mouse for menus. It overall feels like a low-effort console port. I'm going to try to return it.			",32,2,0,5,7,0,14

												Honestly I was very disappointed with this game. I thought that it would be similar to the Nintendo DS version that I own, boy was I wrong. Not only is the gameplay very different but the controls were hard to master. I only got as far as Gringotts and that was all I needed to get to to see just how different this game is. I'd recommend playing the DS version due to the easier controls and the easier spellcasting capabilities. If you like this game play it, if you don't try a different platform for this game.

												Honestly I was very disappointed with this game. I thought that it would be similar to the Nintendo DS version that I own, boy was I wrong. Not only is the gameplay very different but the controls were hard to master. I only got as far as Gringotts and that was all I needed to get to to see just how different this game is. I'd recommend playing the DS version due to the easier controls and the easier spellcasting capabilities. If you like this game play it, if you don't try a different platform for this game.

												Awful game. Got this to play with my 4 yr old, terrible controls, no logic to the puzzles. This is also a terrible port. Controls are awful and with an xbox controller, sometimes become unresponsive mid level. It also takes about 7 clicks to exit the game. I would advise against buying at all. I got it for 2.50 and was robbed. Shockingly bad port, terrible game.			",31,1,0,2,1,0,1

												Piece of garbage. No story whatsoever, only a very rough, limited following of the Harry Potter storyline. So voice acting, the characters just grunt in the short, overly fast-paced cutscenes.Puzzles have not much logic and all of them have exactly 1 solution. The boss fights are near-impossible to complete - solutions are carefully timed to require sub-second aiming with the controller, when the chacters constantly get disrupted. The entire ""game"" experience is nothing but raw frustration.I paid $4.99 for this garbage but that's more than $10 more than what this piece of trash is worth.			",23,38,0,0,1,0,3

												I suppose I should have paid attention  the reviews....specifically where it was mentioned how long it takes to AutoSave an in-progress game. Maybe I'm missing something, but I just started this game yesterday and played through several scenes. More cut scenes than actual areas in which you actually play the game. But, I figured, the game just started. However, I probably spent 15 minutes or so, maybe longer, gathering coins having Hagrid do his thing, through several different rooms. I then needed to stop playing but could no place to save the game, I quit, and now have to start over again...from the beginning? That's really annoying and dumb. There were at least 3 or 4 areas where an AutoSave would have been appropriate but why not allow players to save anywhere? I don't get it....Glad I only wasted 5 bucks on this....could have been a very good game.			",29,2,19,3,0,0,0

												The storyline for this game was great and I loved the lego theme, however, this game was exceeding hard to play as you had to use two characters to play the game with two different controls. This game could have been a lot simpler just by having the same game controls for the two characters and a tab function to move between the two characters. This game was definitely made for a console where two controllers could be used. Glad I bought the game when it was on sale as I won't be playing purely as the controls were silly. My advice if you want this game just save the hassle of silly controls and buy it was the console ratherthan for PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The keyboard controls on this game were so bad, I couldn't play it. No ability to pan the camera when the world seems to be built for you too be able to turn around, and I swear you need three hands for the other basic controls. It's such a nightmare it's a wonder this game was released for PC at all. I would have really appreciated it if somewhere the description mentioned that a controller is strongly recommended (even necessary) for optimal gameplay. I don't own an xbox, and I don't want to purchase a controller for the sake of a single PC game.			",4,1,0,0,1,0,1

Casting spells on everything is actually a lot of fun.  Plus, the cutscenes are entertaining and add a lot of humor to the story.This is a family friendly game, so don't expect much in the way of challenges. You will spend most of your time zapping things looking for stud coins, which is fun at first, but gets a little repetitive by the end.8/10			",244,136,2,17,8,1,26

If you are a diehard HP fan like me, then it is fun to reread the books and rewatch the movies while playing the games as well. While you're at it, head on over to Universal Studios in Orlando and just go to HP world. Anyway this is a classic lego game, fun for kids or adults; Harry Potter fans or newbees.			",44,5,0,5,1,0,0

												Excellent game!

												What can I say?! Boring like every other Lego game that came after the VERY first Lego Star Wars (the one with only ep. 4-6). At least its not such an unmotivated confused ""running around"" as in the Hobbit. But since I dont like the newer HP-Films, anyway, I will surely not invest 5 Euros in the Lego years 5-8 ""just to have it"".  :ÞLego changed their brilliant humor against business-plans of making Money by buying and selling name-rights.So if you buy even lunch-boxes because of the HP-Printing on it, THEN you should also try this game.

												Made the mistake of playing years 5-7 first....this game isn't bad but the sequel is definitely loads better. If you're a big Harry Potter fan it's still a lot of fun to play through the stories (though the cut scenes are long and plentiful). The mechanics suffer in comparison with the sequel. If you're in it for the story, get it. If you're in it for the gaming, skip this one and play 5-7 instead.			",3,5,0,2,3,0,0

												While it is true, that compared to some of the more recent lego games, or even to the Harry Potter years 5-7 gae it lacks a lot, both in graphics and gameplay, the game is still fun to play, and has the unique humor that TT Games has been puting into every Lego game, and which has grown on me over the years. I do recomend it, ot only to Harry Potter fans,but to every LEGO fan as well :)			",28,6,0,4,3,0,9

												A fun and lighthearted game, took around 50 hours of gameplay to reach 100%. I found it quite easy to control the characters and not overly difficult. The story line follows the films rather than the books, so purists beware!However, this game has some major glitches and bugs, which have the potential to be game-breaking. I found that the only way to minimise the glitches was to play with the lowest possible graphics settings.Overall, I would recommend the game, but I bought it at a reduced price and I wouldn't necessarily recommend buying it at full price.

I don't expect the developers to fix the bug in a patch as the game is so old now. Bug issues aside, if you are a HP fan, getting this game is a bit of a no-brainer but be warned that the game play can feel a bit repetitive after a while,			",4,0,0,4,0,0,0

												Really good, it's all famliy friendly and pretty cool. Little bits of humour. The camera angles aren't great, it's all fixed camera which is quite annoying t begin with but you get used to it. Personally, I wish there were a more adult and authentic version of Harry Potter as a video game, but that doesn't mean this one isn't good. Perfect for younger audiences, but I enjoyed it being an adult and I'm sure many others will. Sadly this doesn't have achievements which I think is really sad.			",140,111,4,44,27,0,42

												Normally, I wouldn't recommend games that make buyers jump through hoops and fix errors ourselves. We pay for the games, they should be playable right off the bat. However, this game is one hoop worth jumping through, especially when it's on sale. This is a treat for LEGO and Harry Potter fans. It looks like the movies, but it's a lot more fun. It may seem repetitive at first, but it gets better and better.I've just finished Story Mode, and yes, there is a game-crashing bug in the last level of Year 3. But it can be easily fixed. (My rig is Core-i3, 8 GB RAM, Radeon HD4770, Win7 64 bit) Here's how to fix it. (Credits to people who dedicated their time and effort to find the solution, and everyone sharing it. Thanks a lot :)1. Find PCCONFIG.TXT file. [XP] C:\Documents and Settings\admin.HVTS764\Application Data\WB Games\LEGO HarryPotter\[VISTA & Win7] C:\Users\USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\WBGames\LEGO HarryPotter\2. Back up the original file, then edit the file.

But it should be playable now.3. Play the level. After finishing Year 3, quit the game and bring back the original PCCONFIG.TXT. You should be able to start Year 4 with all the high settings again.Enjoy :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best entries in the lego series of games. Every room has TONS of things to interact with. The animations are done well for all the characters, or as the cool kids call them, minifigs. Attention to the smallest details is seen right from starting the game, from differences in how Harry and Hermione Granger walk, to how Ron freaks out when using his wand. You can play as everyone from the movies, from Malfoy, to Ginny, and even the professors. All of Hogwarts is recreated from the big room they all sit in, to the dorms where they live. Lots of fun abilities, like turning back time, make the same world seem new again. There is ALOT of content in this Lego game, very impressive the level of detail. Not being a Harry Potter fan I had a great time playing the game, and oddly like the game better than the movies.  10/10			",53,1,0,1,0,0,0

												This is one of the most detailed lego games i've ever played every little thing is almost entirely accurate too the movies and the books. The game is fairly lengthy also around 14hrs but with tons of other stuff to do such as exploring and collecting the characters. I'm gonna be honest the port is not great i had very few issues whilst other people cant even get the game too start or levels becoming impossible to complete due to the bugs which is a real shame if you can get the game too work and you dont run into tons of issues its a great game i recommend it to any harry potter or lego fan.

												Absolutely fun and easy going game IF you can get it to not freeze randomly.  In year 3 it randomly freezes right near the end as youre saving Sirius.  You can no longer alt-tab out of the game and must restart your computer if you want to be able to close the game.   This freeze occurs every single time you try to beat this level and therefore makes the rest of year 3 and ALL of year 4 unplayable.  Im not too upset at the fact because i only paid 5 dollars for the game but it kinda annoys me because year 4 was my favorite out of all the years.  But because of the freezing im going to have to recommend that you do not play this game.			",12,1,0,2,1,0,0

												Fun little game-quite brief but you do have to go back to replay levels once completed if you want to 100% it. As other people have been saying it does freeze. I'm playing it with a 360 controller so I'm not sure if it's any different on keyboard play but there has only been once where it hasn't 'not responded'. This would be okay but the only save option is autosave, so you don't know how much you'll have to keep replaying and cutscenes (as far as I know) can't be skippedBuy it if it's on offer but until the freezing/not responding has patched probably not wirth full price			",8,4,0,2,10,0,3

												Various bugs cause this game to fall short of other LEGO installments. The main one being a crash during CO-OP on the last level in the Triward Maze. Even switching to single player we had regular crashes to the point where we almost just gave up playing overall because of how often this game just froze and Crashed to Desktop. Other random freezes and crashes at different points in various levels (some of which are not repeatable) cause us to lose interest. We wanted to complete this game 100% but we've moved on now to other games.If they fixed the issues that have been previously mentioned as well as the one I mention here we would be happy but right now this product is not of usual LEGO game quality.

												My children and I are attmepting to play this god awful adaptation of what some fools idea of playable meant. They seemed to have had the great idea that no matter what you do, as if by magic the game finds a new way to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off by crashing. Sometimes it's a wonderful graphics failure that causes seizures and then the controllers stop working, next the game just shuts down. Why the frig did they release this to PC without sorting these crappy errors, shame on whoever did it, it's soul destroying when it's a genre the kids love and it doesn't do the basic function of staying active whilst the user is trying to play.8/10 for the levels and gameplay1/10 for the core engine that fails 2-3 times everytime we play. Until we get fed up and leave it another week.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best entries in the lego series of games. Every room has TONS of things to interact with. The animations are done well for all the characters, or as the cool kids call them, minifigs. Attention to the smallest details is seen right from starting the game, from differences in how Harry and Hermione Granger walk, to how Ron freaks out when using his wand. You can play as everyone from the movies, from Malfoy, to Ginny, and even the professors. All of Hogwarts is recreated from the big room they all sit in, to the dorms where they live. Lots of fun abilities, like turning back time, make the same world seem new again. There is ALOT of content in this Lego game, very impressive the level of detail. Not being a Harry Potter fan I had a great time playing the game, and oddly like the game better than the movies.  10/10			",53,1,0,1,0,0,0

												This is one of the most detailed lego games i've ever played every little thing is almost entirely accurate too the movies and the books. The game is fairly lengthy also around 14hrs but with tons of other stuff to do such as exploring and collecting the characters. I'm gonna be honest the port is not great i had very few issues whilst other people cant even get the game too start or levels becoming impossible to complete due to the bugs which is a real shame if you can get the game too work and you dont run into tons of issues its a great game i recommend it to any harry potter or lego fan.

This is a VERY bad PC port, with graphical glitches left and right, crashes all over the place, and odd glitchy text that spams your screen. I couldn't get past the first year. I tried to work past the crashes, but then floating, flashing text kept flashing on the screen in rapid, seizure-inducing patterns. Do not get this game. If you want to play it, definitely play another version. The PC port is horrendous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It’s fun if you are into this niche.Story:It’s Harry Potter. Pretty much. The movies not the books.HOWEVER, some scenes are changed and made funnier/different for coop and general humor value (Cedric's death jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ). Thing to note is that there are no voices so if you plan on following the story, you should know what happened. Otherwise, you’re going to be following a bunch of grunts. I really like the fact that the story is conveyed through grunts because it introduces a lot of slapstick and creative ways to explain the story. It requires genuine talent to write and I was impressed. It’s not hilarious but it has it’s charms. Obviously since it's a game, some scenes have more attention paid to them then the movies do and overall, I think they struck a good balance between what could be a level and couldn't. (except the boss fight with Malfoy... WTF?). The pace didn't grind to a halt too badly as there is a lot of material to cover anyways. Gameplay:If you’ve ever seen a lego game, it’s another one. You walk around, collect studs, do minor puzzles, and collect a million other things. As the years progress, you learn new spells which unlock different parts of the castle. I really liked this feature as each year had new areas to explore. However, the actual spell casting isn’t the best as switching between them and the targeting systems are super slow. So if you want to shoot, collect studs, and switch spells to lift something, it will take an unnecessarily long amount of time. Also, the core gameplay really starts to get boring after a while. You naturally explore the world which is fun but when you end up just walking in, shoot everything, and cast spells on specific items in each room, it gets repetitive. The character variety is pretty good with a lot of people that you can also unlock but most people have the same spells so there really isn’t any point. Overall, the gameplay is fun if you’re into Lego games but can get stale pretty fast.Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game doesn’t look amazing but not bad either. It’s pretty respectable for a 2010 game. The game seems to be stuck at 60 but I was constantly in the 200s so I’m good. The game did crash a bunch with it stabilizing a lot after a few restarts but very annoying.Final Thoughts:Lego games are Lego games. They are fun if you’re into collecting or something like that. This one is interesting because it’s not really aiming at kids. You first need to watch all of Harry Potter (deaths and all) and enjoy building lego which is what older fans usually like. So a kids game? Yes (because it's super toned down) and no (due to the knowledge you need to know going into the game). Ovearll, I thought it was not bad. Try it out on sale and see if you like the gameplay. Can get slow at times but it has its charm. UNLESS YOU GO FOR THE 100%. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT♥♥♥♥♥			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												I think it's the best LEGO Game I've ever played! You can interact with so many things, play with almost any character you've ever heard of (some of them aren't even in the films) and it's just so charming when the whole story of the first four books is told with the typical slapstick humour of the LEGO series. I'm so glad that the figures don't talk and still manage to convey the story of the books (although, of course, quite a few things are omitted/changed as they would be difficult to depict, but everyone who knows thebooks and/or the films knows what's going on anyway and will be able to laugh about the funny scenes anyway).I've really had fun with it, alone and in the Co-op mode, which also is very well done in my opinion. I've even played it multiple times (although it's the same every time) and it's one of the few games where I really loved getting it done to 100%.Sure, there were some bugs and crashes, mostly while playing it with another player, but they remained the (very) rare exception,As long as you like humorous (though pretty easy) games and Harry Potter, I think it's a must have!

												If you loved the Harry Potter movies and want to relive them in a child's imagination then this may be worth the effort. I played long enough to realize smashing things for LEGO coins and extremely basic puzzles are the entire game. It's interesting to watch things play out like a LEGO movie for a few minutes but it would be much more exciting to have an actual Harry Potter experience in a more dangerous environment.

												My only gripes with this game: 1, the broomstick handling is not a piece of cake (then again, I'm not sure how they could make it easier without ridiculous levels of over-simplification). 2, the way it freezes you for every announcement of something achieved or unlocked or whatever, especially when it gives you stubs at the same time so you physically cannot get them (I wanted to scream when I missed a crapton of cash upon gaining the Lumos spell because I couldn't move to collect it). 3, the whole ""you lose your progress if you go to Diagon Alley mid-level"" when what a ""level"" is can be difficult to gauge (do the long sequences in Hogwarts count as a level that you have to complete to keep your progress? Not made clear in-game). Otherwise, this is ludicrously fun.			",68,28,0,8,4,0,2

												A great game for anyone who loved legos as a kid.  The environments look fantastic and include a nice mix of lego objects and standard graphics. Casting spells on everything is actually a lot of fun.  Plus, the cutscenes are entertaining and add a lot of humor to the story.This is a family friendly game, so don't expect much in the way of challenges. You will spend most of your time zapping things looking for stud coins, which is fun at first, but gets a little repetitive by the end.8/10			",244,136,2,17,8,1,26

												What can I say?! Boring like every other Lego game that came after the VERY first Lego Star Wars (the one with only ep. 4-6). At least its not such an unmotivated confused ""running around"" as in the Hobbit. But since I dont like the newer HP-Films, anyway, I will surely not invest 5 Euros in the Lego years 5-8 ""just to have it"".  :ÞLego changed their brilliant humor against business-plans of making Money by buying and selling name-rights.So if you buy even lunch-boxes because of the HP-Printing on it, THEN you should also try this game.

												This is one of the best entries in the lego series of games. Every room has TONS of things to interact with. The animations are done well for all the characters, or as the cool kids call them, minifigs. Attention to the smallest details is seen right from starting the game, from differences in how Harry and Hermione Granger walk, to how Ron freaks out when using his wand. You can play as everyone from the movies, from Malfoy, to Ginny, and even the professors. All of Hogwarts is recreated from the big room they all sit in, to the dorms where they live. Lots of fun abilities, like turning back time, make the same world seem new again. There is ALOT of content in this Lego game, very impressive the level of detail. Not being a Harry Potter fan I had a great time playing the game, and oddly like the game better than the movies.  10/10			",53,1,0,1,0,0,0

The game is fairly lengthy also around 14hrs but with tons of other stuff to do such as exploring and collecting the characters. I'm gonna be honest the port is not great i had very few issues whilst other people cant even get the game too start or levels becoming impossible to complete due to the bugs which is a real shame if you can get the game too work and you dont run into tons of issues its a great game i recommend it to any harry potter or lego fan.

												Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 has a little bit for both the Harry Potter and Lego fans. Its casual approach allows for new or young gamers to get a grasp on the controls easily and progress their story through the first few years with relative ease, while offering the more hardcore crowd the chance to mull over puzzles and swap between characters to get their collectables which unlocks new content. I enjoyed the lighthearted story which proved accurate enough that my Harry Potter fan Wife knew what was going on and picked out her favourite scenes but funny enough to get a few chuckles from me.If you've played any other lego games, you will enjoy this title as well.

But I can ignore that for the fun gameplay.It is humorus and very light hearted, not too difficult, and very open 'world'. My little sibling enjoyed crowding around me as I played, so its not just great for the player, but spectators as well.Even the graphics were good, not the best of the lego series, but better then what was expected.All around, I will play this over and over, hope you enjoyit as well.

The camera angles aren't great, it's all fixed camera which is quite annoying t begin with but you get used to it. Personally, I wish there were a more adult and authentic version of Harry Potter as a video game, but that doesn't mean this one isn't good. Perfect for younger audiences, but I enjoyed it being an adult and I'm sure many others will. Sadly this doesn't have achievements which I think is really sad.			",140,111,4,44,27,0,42

												This was my first time playing a LEGO game and I had great fun. Since there is no voice acting in this game, it's pretty important to know the Harry Potter story well, otherwise you won't get the best experience. The game tells the story of first 4 years of Harry Potter, mixing in some great humoristic elements. The gameplay itself is pretty simple but fun. It can get quite repetitive after some time, but it's good fun to play through for some simple entertainment. I do recommend playing this with a controller as the keyboard bindings are rather awkward. Also, for people like me that are completionists, it's sometimes rather frustrating because if you wish to collect everything it becomes quite tedious. I had to really tell myself that it was OK not to collect every little stud, character or cosmetic. I would certainly recommend this game for some relaxed gameplay.			",64,10,2,8,6,0,8

												Come join Harry Potter as he discovers he's a wizard (spoilers!) and begins his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! This is a pretty by-the-numbers Lego game, but that's what we're here for, right? There are a few guide-dang-it moments and reaching 100% completion will either mean a lot of back-tracking or a guide, but it's very achievable for any age group or skill level.I did have some graphical issues, but they were pretty rare - the cut-scenes use the in-game models, and sometimes they would go all fractal. Minimizing the game would usually fix this. Also, you really need a controller for Lego games - the keyboard will make you crazy.One last thing - I just can't figure out why they didn't use the ""kid"" model mini-figs that we've seen in other Lego games. It was a little odd to see the first years just as tall as their teachers.9/10 - But buy it on sale!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Lego games have always been very close to my heart, and Lego Harry Potter is no different. This is a light-hearted, silly game, plain and simple. When I need a break from my more involved games, or if I need to unwind after work and just want to have some fun, this is one of the games I go to.However, the PC version of this game is incredibly buggy. Graphics glitches abound, and you can run into them as early as the start menu. Minimizing the game and bringing it back up will usually ""reset"" the graphics and stop the glitches for a while, but it can still be really jarring and occassionally frustrating. It doesn't happen constantly and you can enjoy the game, but it happens often enough to be annoying.That said, if you can put up with the game bugging out now and then, it's a lot of fun. Definitely one of my favorite Lego games, second maybe to Marvel Superheroes. If you can get it on sale cheap, it's worth it, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. I think I got it during a summer sale for like $5. It's worth waiting for the price to drop.			",92,47,5,14,20,0,4

												As a giant literature nerd, this game appeals to the very relaxing nature of gaming for me. I can relax, watch my favorite scenes play out in weird lego like features, and overall it's adorable. Also, I suck at flying and it's hard.			",3,1,0,0,3,0,1

												I played this game for the first time in 2010 on the Nintendo Wii, and I saw this on sale for £2.49, so I bought it for PC seeing as I sold my Wii. STORY:The game goes through Harry Potter's first four years at Hogwarts (Philosopher's Stone/Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire). There are 6 levels in each year, along with some mucking about around the Hogwarts free-roam. Unfortunately, each story feels shorter than the last, seeing as there is a big difference between the amount of play in Year 1 and the amount of play in Year 4. Also, Goblet of Fire doesn't really feel like it fits in, seeing as it's about 2 hours of gameplay right at the end.GAMEPLAY: As you go on your journey, you'll unlock a full range of spells:ExpelliarmusRiddikulusExpecto PatronumLumos/Lumos SolemWingardium LeviosaImmobulusReductoPlus the ability to summon a pet, turn into an Animagus or use a magical item. The levels can be quite short, and you generally just use the spells to solve puzzles and, often in Year 4, defeat enemies.GRAPHICSThe graphics are OK, but Years 5-7 has the upper hand.FREE ROAMYou can explore all areas of Hogwarts Castle eventually (you unlock most of the areas in Year 1, a few in Year 2, a few in Year 3 and a few in Year 4. Plenty of stuff to keep you busy, like saving Students in Peril and hunting for new characters.CONCLUSIONI may have said some bad points of this game, but it's still a nice little package of Harry Potter magic. 1) Essential Purchase2)Recommended PurchaseRecommended during a sale4)Not recommended unless heavily discounted5)Not recommended even for hardcore Steam gamers			",17,12,0,2,3,0,2

												Possibly one of my favorite games, after extensive research on the LEGO series this is arguably the best series of the games in my opinion. The only game from the LEGO series that is even comparable is the older LEGO Star wars games.			",264,86,12,65,41,5,55

												A brilliant game, I was really enjoying it up until the last chapter of the third year.There is a part of the Dark Tower where the game will always freeze; requiring me to either log-off or shut the computer down.I can't progress or complete the game because of this game breaking bug. :(Steam would also not honor a refund, even after offering to stream so they could verify that the game doesn't work! :(			",104,41,1,11,13,1,5

												So after 30 hours gameplay and finishing all years 1-4 i still only have 57% lol. I keep going back and replaying levels. But dam its gonna take me some time to get 100% I guess ill have to use a guide soon to find where everything is lol. Anyhoo great game, love it. Its very easy but can be annoying at times if your rushing a bit. Its fun and addictive. I have also bought a few other lego games as well and cant wait to play them. There is some humour which is good and gives you a little laugh now and again. If you love collecting things and exploring then this game is perfect for you. Totally recommend when on sale as you just cant go wrong.So i am now 100% done it only took me a few hours..... xx			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: Since I have a new desktop computer now I tried to run the game again and what do you know. It runs flawlessly. It appears like crashes occur on NVIDIA Optimus systems (Mostly laptops with an Intel HD AND an NVIDIA GPU inside). So I'd recommend to stay away from this game if you have a similar setup. As for the game itself, it's a LEGO game. Not much to say there.			",1939,537,92,173,178,15,191
