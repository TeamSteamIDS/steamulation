												This game is suprisingly good,  at first impressions I thought it was going to be a badly put together story and ganeplay, oh how wrong was I!!. Jolly rover reminds me a lot of the monkey island series. The graphics are retro styled and work well with the whole layout of the ganeplay itself. It is narrated throughout which is great as the voices add to the fun of playng, Its not a huge world based game. It has a few locations and three main islands with many explorable parts, not a huge amount of interacable characters but this to me stops it getting boring and clustered. The story is good and the puzzles are fun and not too hard. It is a light ha=earted game but worthy of a 9/10 I would recommend to anyone who wants a casual easy flowing game. If you enjoy click and points give it a try and for the price you cannot lose.			",40,252,1,3,14,2,12

												At first glance this game will look like some sort of Monkey Island ripoff. And in a way, that might be the way to describe it. Personally, I think it's more of a love letter to adventure games of yesteryear, combining the atmosphere and humor typical of major adventure games of the 90s with a few modern twists, including quests to find hidden pieces of eight and crackers, and a clever hint system should you choose to use it. If there's one thing that I dislike about many modern adventure games, it's that they give hints much too easily. Making the puzzles difficult to solve and not forcing hints down your throat is better for an adventuring experience.The developer commentary is quite fun and at times hilarious to listen to, ranging from anecdotes on the game's development to outtakes from the voice artists. (Be on the lookout for Janes singing ""Party In The USA!"") The addition of unlockable character profiles and artwork does feel like an attempt to put in some artificial replay value, but that's really my only major complaint with the game.Overall, if you want a short but sweet ride through a colorful world created as an homage to 90s adventures, I recommend giving this game a shot.

												I'm ashamed. I've begun playing the game in... 2012. Since then, it's been waiting to be finished.Well, I did. Three years after.Jolly Rover is a story about a dog that is a sailor and become a pirate because of an evil governor. Here's Gaius James Rover becoming Jolly Rover, specialized in freeing people, in using Voodoo spells and... in juggling.The plot is nice, that's sure, though you're still asking yourself how Gaius became a sailor when he wanted to be a clown. Anyway, you have the traditional story family, the voodoo, the cannibals, the lady pirates...The graphics are aimed to a young audience: it's colorful, in style with old cartoons that could have been broadcasted during my childhood and they're well done. Everything is easy to understand (well, if you're an English native speaker or skilled in the language, else, you may have an hard time to find what to do).The dialogues are also good, with humor or naivity. Even the voice acting is quite good.The gameplay is a traditional adventure game: discussing is giving you clues, observing objects can be rewarding, well, it's a good trip to memories with old titles of the same genre.No, really, Jolly Rover is well-polished, well-balanced and adapted to a young audience. Recommending it with all my heart.			",852,759,11,38,65,8,71

Had a few adultish jokes in there that I was happy to see to keep the game from getting too kiddy on me.  Ended up a little short but that made for a fun adventure that didn't overstay it's welcome.

												Since there's no new ""Monkey Island"" episode to get our hands on (... and sadly, won't be any for a veeeery long while now that Lucas Arts got purchased and closed down by Disney...), it is good and refreshing to finaly have a newcomer trying its own brand new story!This game has it all, and for an indie studio this is quite an incredible work they have made here: A point&click with a very practical interface, a nice pirate adventure, nice graphics, soundtracks and voice acting, decently animated, well written dialogues, an universe of its own (remember that old Dogtanian japanese cartoon?), and it's fun!The only negative if could think of was the story being too short... but remember it is also the first shot of an independant studio with the resources you can imagine ...and they managed to make this great little game i now recommend you to try.

												Jolly Rover is a fun little classic point & click style adventure game. You play as James Rover, a dog who wants to be a clown but ends up becoming a pirate (yaaaar!). if you are familiar with this genre, then you probably know exactly what to expect - the game isn't breaking any huge molds. But what it does, it does well. None of the puzzles are too hard - if anything, most are too easy - but I thought the difficulty balance was OK (there is even a hint system available if you do get stuck). The game is also very short (5 hours or so). But if you are a fan of this genre, I think you should give it a go. The graphics are nice (though the lack of a hi-res option is lamentable), and the dialogue and voice work are good. The game is pretty funny as well. But it's definitely not for everyone. I wholly recommend it to anyone, like me, who cut their teeth on classic Sierra and Lucasarts adventure games. For anyone else, it might not be up your alley... but I do think it's worth checking out.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

I'm not very good at Point & Click Adventure games. My brain can't seem to move beyond that process of combining a ""Gorilla"" and a ""Woman"" to create a ""Monkey Wrench."" Jolly Rover isn't like that. There's layers of hints for your skill level. The puzzles make sense, the story never lags behind, and it's a pretty funny game. It's actually the first adventure game I beat without looking up spoilers!			",820,290,19,116,69,6,135

												This is Jolly Rover, and it's a game in which, even after 16 hours of play (mostly from forgetting the game's running in a window), I still forget to talk to a certain person to get that damned piece o' eight.Aside from Full Throttle when I was about eight, this is the first adventure game I've ever played to completion, and I'm pretty glad I did. Jolly Rover begins with Gaius James ""Jolly"" Rover making a booze delivery to Governor DeSilver on Groggy Island. But, pirates happen, and Jolly's taken prisoner. You guide his escape and subsequent adventures, which, according to my in-game playtime, will take about five hours to complete.It's a point and click adventure game, so expect a lot of that, however they've also thrown in some spacebar pressing to mix it up a bit. Pressing space will highlight clickable things on the map, and text color tells you what you've investigated and what you haven't (white - seen it, blue - haven't seen it). But the best thing about this game, gameplay-wise, is that in the options menu, there's a walk speed slider, which I recommend slapping against the right side as soon as you boot the game up.You can rate the difficulty of puzzles in this game from ""derp"" to ""how in God's name would I have figured that out without a guide (or Juan)?"" and I'll admit eventually I just used  the really handy guide by LimiT in the Community Guides.Graphically the only complaint is that the game's made to be viewed in 800x600, and if you fullscreen the game, what you're going to get is a stretched out 800x600 with black bars on the side to keep the game at a 4:3. It's not that big of a deal and doesn’t actually ruin things, but people with big monitors might find it bothersome. Aside from that, though, this is a pretty game. The characters and story both fit the cartoony art style perfectly, and the voice acting makes a lot of not-indie games look really bad.But is it worth playing? Definitely. It’s a well put together game in which I encountered no bugs, no glitches, no sudden day ruining crashes. My only real complaint is how ridiculous some of the puzzles can be (I mean really, if I didn’t have a guide, I never would have known what to do with the damn corn). Is it worth $9.99? Nope. Put this on your wishlist and wait for a Steam sale unless adventure games are your thing.			",73,9,1,21,5,0,7

												the idea of pirate dogs didn’t particularly catch my interest, but i heard jolly rover was pretty good.  it doesn’t take itself seriously and doesn’t have the most interesting story, but the puzzles and art are really nice.  sometimes the silliness is entertaining — i especially enjoyed watching the current quest update during dialog.  while it sometimes could have done more to point me in the right direction, most of the puzzles were intuitive and satisfying.  there are also plenty of crackers around to feed to your all-knowing parrot in turn for more useful hints.i definitely recommend jolly rover to adventure game fans as well as anyone who would consider playing an adventure game.  while the cartoon-dog style might make you think it’s appropriate for children, there are a couple things you might want to know:  it says “♥♥♥♥♥es” (in the female dogs context) once and has some sexual connotations that most children probably wouldn’t notice.

When you are done with it, you can replay it with developer's commentary enabled which will include the voice actors' auditions and other hidden gems. Try it out.

												I'd heard good things about this point and click adventure game, so I decided to try it out. I played it during my lunch breaks at work and found it to be quite enjoyable. It recalls fond memories of The Secret of Monkey Island, one of my favorite games of all time.Puzzles were mostly simple, though I'll admit I had to feed Juan the parrot a few crackers for hints on occasion. A few nice ideas streamlined the experience. First of all, holding down the Space Bar would highlight objects around the room that you could interact with. Also, the color of text hovering over objects changes color only if a new reaction will result.The game has a fun sense of humor, and for some unknown reason I feel that pirates and dogs make a great combination.I highly recommended Jolly Rover to classic point and click adventure game fans, especially those fond of the Monkey Island series.

												Unexpectedly good. Got this for $1 in one of the indie paks in christmas, and it really is a very competent point & click, with several additions that enhance the genre. It rewards obsessive clickers with collectibles, and highlights the name of items that you can interact with, and if u tried a particular interaction earlier, the game lets you know by making the text white (as opposed to blue, which indicates a new interaction). It also has a scoring/title system (which I assume is based on how fast you solve puzzles + how many collectibles you get).. it's not much but it's there. Lots of dog puns.Tired of the pirates theme though. Should've left that to Monkey Island.			",389,272,4,55,29,0,52

												Yes, a cat is recommending a game with dogs in it... moving on.It's a funny little adventure game. The story is short and decent enough to deliever, but won't notice till you play a second itme.The target audience is rather mix; while it looks more appealing for kids, it might be more for teenagers and older as it does give some adult humor here and there, but kids may not notice them as they're subtle. Also, they use the female dog term as it's intended to be... so... something to consider.Voice acting is good, but at some spots lacks enthusiasm. The music fits the setting and theme. The animation, while limited, gets it's job done and leaves room for the imagination. There's wit and humor in this game, depending who you talk to, interact, or have poor Jolly attempt something.The puzzles can be a head scracther, but aren't too difficult as they may appear; but if you're really stumped, ask the parrot and feed him a cracker (if you have any) and he'll give you hints to tips or a solution (depending how much you feed him if you find yourself stuck). There is minor back tracking in some circumstances, but that's expected in adventure games.My only issue, for the achievements anyway, is it's easy to miss a few things that are very well hidden or in places that weren't there originally and won't be able to go back after a certain event till you start over from the start, like finding all the flags or crackers and whatever gets you the highest score in the game. It can be frustrating for achievement hunters, especially since you can't have multiple saves and it only autosaves, but you'll have to grin and bare it if that's your thing.The price is worth it, overall. I'd pick it up if you like adventure games with a pirate theme to it.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												DO NOT BUY. While the game has some interesting elements and occasionally hilarious dialogue, the cons outweigh the pros. The ""organic, intuitive"" hint system is arbitrary at best, providing least help for difficult puzzles and excessive help for easy ones. It's also incapable of telling how much you have already solved. Much worse than that is the terrible handling of an extremely interesting plot. Aside from terrible pacing and difficulty knowing where to go next at times for story progression, the most important and crucial revelations are revealed through sudden, unexpected dialogue options or unintuitive question choices. Solemn and important scenes are switched into humor or blase gameplay so quickly that you have no time to process the emotional signifigance. Certain questions arise about the main plot - huge questions - that are either answered in the bonus content or not at all.Puzzle answers are just obvious enough to frustrate the player when their solution fails to work and then are told by the hint system to do exactly what they've done. Some very interesting puzzles are handled so poorly that instead of admiring the system you curse whoever wrote it.  Scenes provide enormous eyecandy that you cannot interact with, and then numerous repeated items that you CAN click but have no point. Achieving 100% completeion takes either several playthroughs or use of a guide (I can confidently say I would never have finished without a guide due to the unintuitiveness of some puzzles), without content changing a bit. The bonus content is decent but not a selling point.All told, this game is at best a sub-par, disappointing waste of great potential. Not terrible, but could just be so much better.

												This is quite a funny little adventure. The best way to describe it would be as ""Noob's first point-and-click adventure"" and I say this for a few reasons.1. You are given a general tutorial on what to do, but also you are given a hint ability in the form of a parrot names Juan.2. When you hover your mouse over something you can interact with, the name shows up in purple if something new will happen, white if there's nothing more interesting about it, same with using items with it.3. This might sound a bit silly coming from me, but they're Anthros, though in a more ""kid-friendly"" sort of way and it's quite harmless with no scenes of blood or violence let alone swear words.As you can see it seems to be aimed as a younger age range, however I enjoyed playing it because it was atleast a little funny and it makes you feel smart by being so easy and many different collectables in the game. Crackers (to use for hints if stuck), peices of eight and flag peices. A fun and harmless game.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												I was given the key for this by the Brawsome guys after hitting up their table at PAX Aus 2013, where they were showing off MacGuffin's Curse, and while I'm definitely a fan of point and clicks, I had the middling expectation that I'd put maybe an obligatory ten minutes into it before deleting it from my computer, never to resurface from the depths of my steam backlog again.I ended up completing it and clearing all the achievements in essentially one sitting. It's really very charming and funny, with a good 2-ish+ hours of casual gameplay, depending on how much you dawdle around. Definitely one for the to-buy list if it goes on sale for <$5			",134,95,1,47,12,0,17

												A neat little point-and-click puzzle-adventure game where everyone is a dog. I never actually finished it, but it was charming and neat, and rather challenging to boot. If that's your kind of thing, or you want more furry games in your library, go for it.			",150,23,1,21,21,1,21

												An incredible masterpiece. At the first glance, nothing too impressive. Mediocre puzzles and old challenges might not impress, however the atmosphere and the humour counts for it all. The story is fun, pretty original as well. The game also features laughing from the point and click genre cliches and popular events from the real life. The game is short, however, took me 5 hours to complete. But knowing the price and the quality of Jolly Rover its worth it. Also there is a little of replay value as well, though I doubt you will play it more than 2 times. Recommended to buy.			",361,70,14,41,37,4,61

I never really liked the point and click adventure games before but after playing Jolly Rover I started to love the genre. I definitely recommend it. It's worth every penny.

												Simple, cute, amusing point and click.  Fun story and characters.  I loved playing it.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=lovedGame design: 4/5 The game is really tight and everything works well.  However, there are some extra things needed for 100% that you really have to guess at to accomplish.  You need to click everything in every scene twice before you move on to a new area of story because you can't go back, and that doesn't guarantee that you'll find everything because there's no reason for a lot of it.  It adds a little replayability because it's a short game, but that's a cheap tactic.Tone: 5/5 Fun.  Cartoony.  Pirates.  Great things working great together.Personal skew: 4/5 This is a pretty easy and short game.  If you are a hardcore point & click gamer who wants a challenge and for some reason you paid full price for this game, you'll probably feel pretty ripped off.  But for me this game was great fun.

												A very short game. The game was also only about 4 hours long start to finish.Jolly Rover is a Point 'n Click Adventure game which is similar to the Monkey Island series except every characters are dogs and puppies.The puzzles are clever and not confusing at all. Most of them could be figured out without having to look up for guides as they are not random as other bad PnC Adventure games (e.g. Strong Bad).The dialogues are humurous and are the best part of the game, but also the weakest part. The game does not do anything extra ordinary, but it does wrap up the elements of a good PnC Adventure game pretty well.If you are a fan of PnC Adventure games, it's worth to pick up for a cheap price.

												Pretty fascinating work under the ""Monkey Island"" and ""Loom"" Worlds.It really combines those games in a good pirate story.- Easy Adventure for a hard core adventurer,still very interesting!- Funny- The graphics are cartoons but still in a 1920x1080 widescreen you see a 4x3 signal and a little blured graphics. For a modern game I would expect at least a widescreen signal.- All the game is about easy except one shot.(Finished it in about 8 hours without idle times.)To all Modern guys that don't know much for adventures it is TIME to Start. You 'll have pretty fancy timeTo the oldies... How many memories came buy... Loom, Monkey Island and a little bit from others.Try it! It's really worth it for such a company!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a point and click adventure game.  If you liked games like Monkey Island, sure you will reasonably enjoy it.  Replay value is very limited unless you missed some of the achievements.  The voice acting was good, the puzzles were simple.  Its a game you play when you have played all the greats already.  Honestly I bought this game on sale, Its filler something you play between waiting for the return of the golden age of classic point of clicks. Which sadly is never going to come back again.  I enjoyed it.  It made me miss my old adventure games.  If you can get it on sale I'd reccomend it.			",900,467,37,165,112,8,170

Of those 74 minutes, the 73 I didnt spend pawing off my furry yiffstick to that effeminate dogman were spent with a block of ice cooling down my glowing red rocket. Ive never met a dog I wanted to ♥♥♥♥ more than whatever the player character's name was. The dealbreaker for me was that I found out the devs were aussies. alt-F4'd and uninstalled it on the spot.

												Jolly rover is a fun click adventure game that includes the brilliant aspects of puzzles along with a well thought out storyline. The game is full of strange and bizarre characters; all of them are well voice acted and memorable. The game doesn’t cut corners when it comes to visual art either, the style feels unified and not out of place. The puzzle selections are diverse but sadly the game demands a too specific way to win. There are no branching storyline in this game. The developers clearly intended for that to happen because they included a talking parrot to guide the players in the event they are stuck. The game flows perfectly and the witty storyline fits in very well with the puzzles. Overall pretty average game, not nearly as good as Myst but not nearly as♥♥♥♥♥♥as the other indie puzzle clicker games. For 5 dollars or less you get around 5 hours of entertainment, not too shabby at all!			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Jolly Rover is a perfect example of everything that stinks about adventure games. The solutions to the puzzles don't always make logical sense; you find yourself just clicking wildly on every item and every square inch of each room until you ""solve"" the puzzle. Bor-ing! If the ""humor"" was actually funny, or if there was a story to be told, I might have enjoyed Jolly Rover more. But it wasn't, and there wasn't, so I didn't.Steer clear of this wreck. I suggest the more thoughtful ""Puzzle Agent"", instead.			",168,51,2,18,21,2,22

												The art style and the dialog at the beginning of the game make it almost feel like it should be lumped in with young children games like Putt Putt and Pajama Sam (which, for their targeted age group, are awesome in their own right) but once you start getting into the meat of the story you'll find puzzles and plot that any fan of Monkey Island or Sam&Max series should love.

You can get just a little hint or have the whole puzzle blown open because it's been driving you mad.  Good story and very intuitive puzzles. Gaius is most certainly the next Threepwood.

												My Rating:""★★★★✰"" This is a really fun point and click adventure game. If you're into games sorta like Monkey island then you might really enjoy this one. It has some really funny humor and it is pretty dark for it's innocent cute puppy dog look. Lots of murder talk & beer drinking in this game. Don't let the cute look fool you, it's a full blown T rated title in my book. Oh and I can't forget the outstanding voice acting in this game. I was really impressed with the voice overs. It made this game super enjoyable to play.Pirates,♥♥♥♥♥es(literally),boos,murder and bipedal K-9 makes it a real fun play. :^). I really suggest trying out the demo. You might like it.Difficulty: Not too hard, but some puzzles are thougher than others.Replay Value: Yes there is some fun to be had over again here.			",409,115,5,40,49,6,43

												More or less a fairly wholesome and family friendly point and click game, with a pirate-dog theme.There is no non-cartoon violence, only the mildest of sexual references, and one modest incident of swearing in the whole game.  Puzzles are mostly straightforward and the game is excessively generous with its hint system.  The game starts out a little underwhelming but once you get past the first zone it becomes quite a bit better.  Voice acting is passable, and the main character is a bit charming after awhile.  The biggest downfall of the game is probably that it isn't exceptionally amazing for a modern core gamer who expect a big wow factor, from graphics or production or epic story.  This isn't anything against it, it seems like a modest indie title and honestly it does nothing wrong.  It just means its not likely to get any amount of exposure.I found the game charming and had a good time with it, and again its quite family-friendly so take that as you will.  Lasts about 4 hours or so, with no performance issues or bugs.  A more scalable resolution would have been nice too.  Probably would have been something I played as a kid.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												A short but pretty good Monkey Island with dogs, this one's worth your money not least because an Aussie developer made it.It's a pretty traditional adventure game with inventory puzzles and the like but it does its best to differentiate itself and avoide some of the trappings which annoy me so much about the genre. First and foremost, is that you change the ♥♥♥♥ing speed at which your main character walks. Secondly, there's a really good hint system at work ranging from vague to explicit instructions and really helped alleviate the frustration which inevitably comes upon you when you can't work out what to do. A pretty cool collectible system which rewards you with concept art and music and a developer's commentary which I've yet to listen to when you finish the game. I think I got this for $5 when it was on special. Worth that if this is you're genre. A little short but very charming.			",227,70,7,39,13,3,41

												A pretty good adventure game.The voice acting isn't the greatest, and the game only runs in 800x600, but those are the only downsides that stand out for me, and they're not dealbreakers.It's not very long. I completed my first playthrough in a bit over 4 hours, and I didn't rush through at all. I don't think this is a bad thing, it keeps the story focussed, without too many sidequests and distractions.There's also plenty of hidden goodies to find, but if you're a good adventure player you'll already click on everything, so it shouldn't be too hard to find at least most of them. Still, it's a nice addition.Don't be put off by the dogs. A few puns aside, they could as easily have used humans.Overall, if you even slightly like adventure games, it's worth the price.

I tried not to cheat or get hints and only needed to twice.Overall good for what it is, and it was amusing... however at times it was also typical of point and click... sometimes you just combine things to combine them without any logic.

I did get stuck in a couple areas for a while, though I was sure I tried the one thing that did work already before I looked it up.All the good things said, it's short.  It doesn't take long to go through it, even with taking a while to figure something out.  The blacksmith shop should definitely have been used for something given the amount of detail that was put into it.It is also fairly easy, but that is as good as it is bad.If they made a Jolly Rover 2, I would buy it.

												While not up to the standards of Monkey Island, the levels of writing and wit in this game are surprisingly high. It's a good adventure that's fairly child-safe, as they probably won't get the occasional adult joke. It has good voice acting, fun characters, cute art, and the built in hint system counters the occasional inobvious puzzle. The only real complaint I have is that it's so darn short; you can beat it in a single sitting with ease, and there's not much replay value unless you just like farming steam achievements with a walkthrough on hand.

												Jolly Rover wishes it were Monkey Island. That's not to say it's a bad game -- the art style is functional, the story is linear but well-written, none of the puzzles are too unintuitive or trivial -- but it's clearly striving for adventure game excellence and falling well short.A solid 7/10, less if you're aggravated by pirates or anthropomorphic dogs or goofy accents.

Pros*Very Likable characters*Its got alot of humor*some very nice puzzles and some unique ones iv seenthus far.*Clicking on some of the items can get you some funny commentsfrom the main character.*Nice storyCons*Very short (can finish in about 1 hour 30mins maybe less)*Very little replay value (Only for achievements you may have missed)But all in all a pretty solid game and would only recommend if its on sale for less than $5.Would click again 7.5/10			",162,47,1,24,7,0,14

												Hmm, not the best point and click game I've played recently. The main reason being the story. It was weak, there was nothing consistent enough to encourage you to keep playing. The characters, except for Gaius, weren't really fleshed out like they could have been. Clara was incredibly dull! On the positives, the puzzles were interesting and creative. It seemed like a fair tribute to Monkey Island. I'm sure it was no mistake the amount of similarities there were. 6/10 - there are better games to play but if point and click is one of your favourites then by all means play, play, play!

												Did you like Monkey Island? Wish there was more? Well this isn't it. But it's a surprisingly passable replacement and funnier than I expected.			",257,179,2,23,25,4,47

												Clever little adventure game with a nice score, funny writing, puzzles that never get obscure, and one hell of an awesome parrot. Also, lots of crackers.			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

												Even though it looks like a Monkey Island knockoff, it's actually pretty good on its own. If you like the Monkey Island games, it's worth a shot.			",179,96,3,26,19,2,37

												On sale for £1.50, Jolly Rover is a reasonable Monkey Island clone with a decent sense of humour. It's a little childish but for this price, grab it.			",237,104,17,64,66,8,49

												Was quite the fun adventure.... although running it a second time to beat the game without hints and to collect all the treasures.... was really really quick compared to the first time around... so I can't say there's a whole lot of replayability unless you wanna breeze through it like Portal 1.

												Corny cheesy fun, not as whitty as your more traditional Monkey Island games, but definately a good ol' 'bout of piratey fun. Not too long in gameplay, and the majority of puzzles are fairly easy and amusing.Word of warning: avoid speaking to your tattered parrot familiar at all costs, as he will regularly ruin gameplay and give things away without you even asking!

												While not up to the standards of Monkey Island, the levels of writing and wit in this game are surprisingly high. It's a good adventure that's fairly child-safe, as they probably won't get the occasional adult joke. It has good voice acting, fun characters, cute art, and the built in hint system counters the occasional inobvious puzzle. The only real complaint I have is that it's so darn short; you can beat it in a single sitting with ease, and there's not much replay value unless you just like farming steam achievements with a walkthrough on hand.

												This game was ""jolly"" good fun! (Annnnd I just made myself cringe. Note to self: no more awful puns) I can't even begin to explain how refreshing it was to finally play a game where all of the puzzles and solutions were completely logical. It seriously sucks all the fun out of a game if you have to consult a walkthrough every 5 minutes. The dialogue and voice acting were so good that I didn't feel the need to rush through or skip any of it either, which is rare. It's even rarer that I replay a game but I'm looking forward to the bonus commentary.			",6,51,0,5,1,0,0

												A solid indie p&c adventure game that's admittedly just slightly rough around the edges in most segments, but charming and pleasant enough to drive you to the finish, despite some tedium here and there. You'll see some very inspired design visually and mechanically, you'll see some less inspired in the same category. Same with the writing / the humor. The voice acting for some characters is surprisingly great. It's quite short (playing time was @ 3 hours when I'd finished it first on Steam - I HAVE finished it before once, years and years ago, but retained almost no memory of the gameplay... apart from some vague memories about the voodoo mechanic, which might've knocked several minutes off the game time now I guess - but you won't mind. Unlocking the commentary might give an excuse to OCD-ish / completist players to do it all over again, especially since you'll likely miss (or, hopefully less likely, use) some of the crackers and the coins - which otherwise unlock music, art and character bios as you collect them. I'm not 100% sure I'd have done it if I hadn't missed the second to last coin in the game, but hey...Anyway, it's a fun little game, recommended to fans of the genre... and people who dig the idea of dog pirates and find it cute. :)			",146,75,6,24,9,2,35

												This is actually a very enjoyable little game.  It only takes like 3 hours to beat but then you can play it over with commentary.			",155,25,4,8,7,0,2
