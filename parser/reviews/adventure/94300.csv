												The Dream Machine is a twisted, dreamlike, sometimes disturbingly nightmarish point-and-click game done in clay animation style.Gameplay 7.5 out of 10The puzzles are mostly point and click some are quite easy to solve and some are a bit tricky and even a bit absurd.Graphics 9/10Pure honest hard work done by the hands of “sexy Swedish guys”.9 Points for the unique, morbid style. I really really like the clay graphic style. Two Thumbs up for the game devs for putting such a heck load of work into this game.Music 8/10Dreamlike, ominous sounds, which nicely add to the atmosphereStory 9/10 The story is intriguing and sometimes even a bit disturbing and grim. To make it short, without spoiling anything, you travel through the dreams of various people with the help of the Dream Machine.

												This game is ridiculously good - so much so that I'm actually writing a review. Please PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy it - even full price! It's more than worth it. I won't go in detail into game mechanics and whatnot (other reviews do the mechanics justice) but suffice it to say the claymation is well-done, the puzzles are interesting and often challenging, and the plot is very engaging. It's a great story! And while it's not a ""scary"" game, it is a deliciously disturbing one (I mean, it's based on dreams, of course it's gonna be disturbing, especially in the later chapters. I guess I'd say it's a similar feeling as watching one of Tim Burton's films, but with more blood, and a slightly more mature rating.) The only downside to this game is having to wait for the 6th chapter to come out. Rambling aside, 2 thumbs way waaaay up.			",134,106,0,27,9,1,11

												Another drop in the vast ocean of point-and-click adventure games, The Dream Machine stands like a beacon signaling a reinvention of the worn genre. With landscapes and characters created entirely out of clay and cardboard, Erik Zaring and Andes Gustafsson helm this unexpected foray into our subconscious.The Dream Machine tells the story of Victor Neff, a man who has just moved into a brand new apartment with his pregnant girlfriend Alicia. However, after their first night here, they begin to realize there's something incredibly ""off"" about this place. They both have strange dreams, the landlord is kind of creepy, and the previous tenant has left a mysterious note of warning. Though the dreams could just be a result of the stress of moving day and the note could have easily been a prank, things just keep getting weirder, prompting Victor to investigate.The very first thing players will notice about the Dream Machine is its unique art style. In fact, the game was nominated for an award in ""Excellence in Visual Arts"" at the 14th Annual Independent Games Festival. That's because Cockroach Inc. has taken a different approach to game design: they decided to make all the set pieces and characters out of cardboard and clay. No polygons invited. This coats the whole affair in a layer of imperfection; it's flawed and raw, but in a way that gives it a deeper level of humanity. In fact, the guys at Cockroach have even admitted to intentionally leaving fingerprints on some of the objects in the game to accomplish this very thing.The story is an admittedly adult tale of new beginnings, represented by both the move to a new apartment and the new life Victor's girlfriend carries in her womb. The Dream Machine's plot draws on basic human fears, but not in a Silent Hill sort of way. Instead, the game plays on real-life day-to-day fears that most people will encounter at some point in their time on this planet. Moving to a new place can be scary. Having a child on the way can be scary. And finding out that your landlord has a video camera in your bedroom is extremely scary.There is a little bit of music in the game, and it's appropriately dark. Some of it is plain ominous, and other bits of it seem to accentuate certain aspects of the story. Mr. Morton's discordant jazz music fits his personality quite well, for example. Sound effects are minimal, but that sort of goes with the point-and-click territory.The gameplay here is simple; The Dream Machine adheres to the age-old point-and-click adventure game formula, leading players through a series of puzzles before showing them each piece of the story. Thankfully, puzzles in the Dream Machine are incredibly clever. Too many point-and-click games are full of incomprehensible puzzles with completely nonsensical answers. The Dream Machine, however, has some incredibly well-thought-out solutions that will ultimately make sense. That's not to say they're easy; quite the contrary. Some of these solutions won't present themselves until you've spent a good deal of time just pondering over the things you've seen so far. But when you finally do stumble upon a solution, it's immensely satisfying.If you have any interest at all in point-and-click games, or need a powerful defense in the ""games as art"" debate, you should definitely check out The Dream Machine.

												I'll start this review by saying that I've only played the first four chapters of this game thus far...that's four outta six, and the sixth isn't even done yet, but having completed two-thirds surely earns me my two cents.  Secondly, and simply, I'll just say that this is absolutely, positively, hands-down one of the best point-and-click games that will ever be made, probably in the annals of human history, and unless the devs drop dead in the meantime you can rest at least 99% assured that they WILL finish the darned thing, even if they're taking a bit longer than they initially intended to.     But hey, which would you prefer...a really, really good point-and-click game a year ago, or a truly classic point-and-click game in, say, a couple of years from now?  Cockroach Inc ain't dumb...they're in this one for the history books and the betterment of mankind, nuthin' less.  And you'd better BELIEVE it, buddy-boy.    Point-and-click games and myself, we don't exactly have a history of getting along that well, but this may well emerge as my all-time personal favourite of the genre.  Sure, I've required a few walkthrough consultations to date, but such is be expected with a semi-vegetative brain such as mine.  Whatever you do, don't go holding my confirmed stoopidity against the game, a'ight?  I'm the idiot, it's the savant.  Clever mother-♥♥♥♥ers, them Cockroaches... Verdict: 9.5/10. (PS How many games reference - whether deliberately or inadvertently - the sheer brilliance that is David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME?  Maybe a bit of EXistenZ thrown in for good measure?!  Talk about taste!!  Gorgeous ♥♥♥♥ing claymation, too, I might add...)			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												I'd never heard of this game when I got it in a bundle. I now think it's the most underrated game in my library, and perhaps the most underrated point-and-click I know of. The story is incredible. It's very imaginative and becomes darker and more intriguing the deeper you go. It reminded me of the early films of Jeunet and Caro (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) which is no small accolade. The puzzles are decent and never illogical; the few times I cheated I kicked myself when I read the solution. I would recommend The Dream Machine over many other, more renowned point-and-click games. Very glad I stumbled upon this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not usually someone who gets into point-and-clicks - I usually get stuck or bored talking to people and I'm too guilty to use walkthroughs but I made it through the first 3 chapters with only one less-than-ovious head-scratching moment.It's weird to look at, weird to play and so probably not for everyone but I love it - it's has a great balance of creepy and mysterious and it's quite original in places too.Puzzles are tricky sometimes but there are no red herrings (tho I've no idea about the bench in Chapter 3!) and everything you need is reasonably easy to find if you look in the right places.  There are oo tiny changes in the cursor or 2-pixel-wide items - movement is quick - no convoluted dialogues to dig through - you mostly just play the game instead of walking, talking and so on.Update: since writing that I've tried Chapter 4 and - unfortunately - I keep running into a crash bug which leaves me unable to continue.  This isn't ideal but hopefully the developer will address it/I'll figure out a different way around the problem - and the puzzles do seem a LOT harder in this episode too! :(			",606,162,56,93,91,4,107

												I really don't write reviews very often. However, I felt that this one really deserved one. The Short: This is an incredibly well-designed game. The developer's were able to capture that very rare ""spark."" While it may be a little short (I really took my time and it took me an hour per chapter), it is one of immense quality. Overall 9.5/10.The Longer: - Gameplay: It is your standard point-and-click adventure game. You are given a small story or situation and you have to solve puzzles to progress. My only real complaint, which isn't much of a complaint, is the sudden advancement in difficulty. In the first two chapters, I didn't really come across any problems/difficulties. The third chapter was really hard! You'll understand when you have to make a certain drink. - Music: I loved the soundtrack. It matches the situations and environment very, very well. It ranges from the caretaker's creepy jazz song to minimalistic ambience to Silent Hill-esque rhythms.  - Story: This is easily one of my favorite stories that has come from recent gaming. Without giving too much away, it begins as a simple tale about a couple moving into a new apartment. Soon, it evolves into an (without exaggeration) epic adventure involving the dream world, a science project gone wrong, and horror. - Graphics/Environment: The clay animation was a really smart artistic choice. It helps to add a fresh perspective on the genre. The environments are all interesting and enchanting. The characters are... scary looking. To the developers, I sincerely enjoyed your game.

												Note: This review is only for Chapters 1-5 so far (6 isn't out yet). This game was collecting dust in my library for quite a while. I figured it was just another standard P&C to slog through when I had nothing better to do. On a whim I started playing though, and boy, was I wrong.I don't think I've been this impressed by a P&C in a very long time. It has its flaws of course, but I can unwaveringly and wholeheartedly recommend it to any lover of P&C puzzle games, especially experienced players looking for more thoughtful challenges (some of which put even Daedalic's better puzzles to shame). If you're already intrigued, do buy and play this game. If you're still on the fence or want to know more of what you're getting yourself into, keep reading. Skip to the end for a sum-up.The Good StuffGeneral FormatFrom the very start, The Dream Machine sharply breaks from the by-now-expected P&C conventions: long cut-scene intros, expositional voice-overs, difficulty modes, Captain Obvious tutorials, sparkly ""active zones/items"", and recharging hint systems will not be found here. (There's a vague ""hint mode"", but it's off by default.) There is no hand-holding. You are thrown directly into the water (somewhat literally) and expected to figure it out for yourself. Yes, the first short section does function a little like a tutorial, but it's still one you must navigate on your own. While this kind of no-HUD, no-hints style may seem potentially difficult or off-putting to some people, it's actually nice to see a game that doesn't patronize the player. In other words, it ""speaks to you like an adult"", and duly expects you to think like one. That's incredibly refreshing.It also does not follow the cliché format of ""random female protagonist solving a mystery she's only vaguely connected with"". I'm all for female protagonists, but it's still nice to see variety once in a while, as well as a protagonist more invested in their own storyline. Presentation/StyleI've always loved games that take advantage of more unique graphic styles, particularly stop-motion. In this case, some aspects of the clay and cardboard style take a bit of getting used to (the characters don't really have facial expressions, for example, or even eyeballs), but it still creates a very pleasant and memorable feel. Anyone out there who remembers the 1996 game ""The Neverhood"" will definitely notice a similar charm. A more contemporary example would be something like Plastiland. There are no animated sequences or cut-scenes breaking up the flow or art style, like you'll find in a lot of modern games. Clay and cardboard is the omnipresent playing field, and apart from a couple of longer dialogues to click through, the player has control of the protagonist from start to finish - even while transitioning from one chapter to the next.StorylineThis has to be one of the most in-depth and convoluted (in a good way) storylines I've encountered in a P&C in years. Physically delving into the ""collective unconscious"" or ""dreamscape"" is not a new idea, but the reasons you venture through them are unique. In addition, the decisions Victor is presented with throughout, whether straightforward, questionable, or bizarre, are ultimately what shape his character and slowly allow the player to sympathize with his personal situation. Victor/the player has very clear emotional and realistic reasons for being proactive in the story, as opposed to the passive ""outsider"" feeling one gets from games with a nonchalant and uninvolved protagonist. Victor and the other characters may not be very deep as far as personality, but interactions are scripted quite well, essentially turning each character into an archetype anyone can relate to - which is significant, considering the lack of facial expressions.I was also impressed with the number of times situations or aspects of the story genuinely shocked or touched me. Without giving anything away, the slow realization that occurs at the end of Chapter 5 literally made me gasp. That level of emotional immersion is very rare in my experience.PuzzlesThe puzzles are where Dream Machine sets itself apart. They involve in-depth thinking and down-to-earth, ""realistic"" logic, instead of ""try every item in your inventory and hope something works"". One of the better initial examples that illustrate that stark difference is the second puzzle involving the hammer and anvil. Yes, it requires a bit of real-world knowledge, but the sense of accomplishment once you pick up on that is extremely satisfying. Some puzzles (like the hammer one) have an obscure hint within the dialogue to point you in the right direction, but most of the time solutions simply require exploration of the environment and good 'ol brain grease. Young Edie's advice in Chapter 4 is a particularly tricky dialogue hint, but pretty darn clever in the end. Another example of ""realistic"" thinking involves the second cube in Willard's dream in Chapter 5. It's such a simple solution, but players these days are so accustomed to overthinking puzzles that it's easy to miss the obvious round-peg-goes-in-round-hole stuff.LengthEach chapter takes a good amount of time to complete. Even taking idling into account, it took me over 9-10 hours to complete all 5 chapters, which is really good compared to the 2.5 to 3 hours you can squeeze out of many cookie-cutter P&Cs. It's more on par with the length of the better Daedalic games, like The Whispered World or The Dark Eye series.The Not So Good StuffMy main gripe is with a handful of puzzles. Their common aspect is that you must return to a specific location you previously visited at least once, because something there will have changed that significantly furthers the gameplay (a visual cue or new interactive object), but you are given no indication that you need to revisit that location. You're left to randomly search areas and play ""spot the difference"" from memory. That isn't fun. One of the worst offenders is the near-unreadable cipher that appears in the front office after you complete Morton's chapter. Solving that puzzle also requires knowledge about another room you probably forgot about, because you used it once already. It's a lot of needless running around unless you keep notes. And don't even get me started on the recipe book and door code in Chapter 3. Clever mechanics, yes, but waay too obscure. I don't like resorting to LPs when the rest of the game is so satisfying to solve on my own. (Note that following a walkthrough can spoil a lot of the ""surprise/realization"" aspects of the story, so a decent amount of patience for the majority of puzzles is recommended.)The fusebox puzzle in the apartment was also one I had to look up. I may be in a minority here, but that wire layout made no sense to me (and I've played many similar puzzles before).For such a polished game, it was a tad strange to see some obvious spelling errors. But they don't disrupt gameplay/immersion.OverallThe Dream Machine is leagues above its competitors in the genre as far as depth of story and intelligent puzzle design. Solutions are smart, realistic/logical, and very satisfying to figure out. A few puzzles are too obscure or provide few/no clues for progression, but as annoying as those can be in the moment, they don't detract from the quality of the game as a whole. As a seasoned P&C player, I wholly recommend this title to anyone looking for more intellectual challenge from a clever game that not only does not hand-hold, but treats the player like the smart person they are instead of assuming they need a tutorial on how to pick up a shovel.

												The Dream Machine is, by far, one of the most complicated adventure games I've ever played. You play as a man who has just moved with his wife to a new apartment. Something is amiss, however, and soon you learn that you'll have to take it upon yourself to stop a sinister plot where your dreams, and the dreams of all the apartment residents, are being infiltrated by your land lord and his out of control contraption. The graphics are marvelously creepy, being claymation, and the soft ambeint music and horror-like storyline set the scene for a truly challenging adventure that will have you immersed for hours. Game play wise, I will say that some of the puzzles may be easy to solve in a few minutes, and other may take hours, or even days, depending on your thought process and how you deal with puzzles. There are puzzles for all types of people, so while I certainly don't suggest that you cheat, it's always fun to team up on this game. Some of the game play can get slightly monotonous while you're stuck, which can be frustrating. (But such is the bane of adventure games.) There were also a few times where I thought I was supposed to be trying to solve a puzzle to unlock something, but it wasn't time for that in the story yet. Still, when things become clear, it's easy to sit down and focus on the puzzle intently.The story line is creepy and unsettling. It is not a full out horror tale, but at times it can be graphic and disturbing. It also moves slowly towards the disturbing, and as you get further into the plot it becomes stranger. This IS the sort of adventure game where you may need to keep some scrap paper beside you in order to jot down notes and figure things out. If you are not into complicated adventure games, then this is not for you. But if you are, then welcome to The Dream Machine.  ",37,37,0,8,3,0,6

												Typically, with episodic games, each chapter is produced within a reasonable time frame.  When I purchased this game in December of 2012, I paid for a complete game and wholly believed that delivery of a final product would be imminent.Four years have elapsed since my purchase and the final chapter has yet to be released.  It's been two years since the release of any new content and six years since the introduction of the first chapter.  Not only hasn't the game been finalized, but the developer can't even provide an estimated release date for the final chapter.  They have, however, posted some news recently--I've been happily informed that they are enjoying themselves in Switzerland and getting drunk off absinthe.  Seriously, that's what they said.Now I may not know a lot of things, but there's one thing I am sure of--I'm not a bank.  I don't give loans to people so they can develop products at their leisure.  I don't take part in crowdsourcing and I don't buy Early Access.  And I definitely would not have purchased this game, or any other game, knowing that it would be at least four years until I experienced its conclusion.  I would not buy a game that I would play for 3 hours, then put down for several years, only to pick it back up again, smack dab in the middle of the story, just to play for another 3 hours.  Who the ♥♥♥♥, in their right mind, would knowingly hand their money over to someone so they could do that?  No one, that's who.  No one would--it's absurd.  Knowing that I would never consciously do such a thing, I can only conclude that there has been some amount of deception involved concerning the sale of this game.I may not have asked when the final chapter would be released, but why would I have any reason to assume it would be at least 4 years until that occurred?  Being a linear point-and-click adventure game, with each chapter only a few hours long and having no replay value, it really doesn't make any sense for someone to sell this type of game piecemeal if there was going to be several years between each chapter's release.  I think it's quite reasonable to assume that this game would have been fully developed within a short span of time--several months, perhaps a year at the most.  Early Access did not exist at that time and I had no reason to believe that Steam was in the business of selling games that were at the beginning of a 6+ year development cycle.Based on my experience with this title, I will never make the mistake of purchasing another incomplete, episodic game again and I will definitely not be supporting this developer, by any means, in any of their future endeavors.Here are the release dates for reference:Chapters 1 and 2 - December 2010Chapter 3 - October 2011Chapter 4 - August 2013Chapter 5 - November 2014Chapter 6 - ?This review was edited on October 6, 2016.

												First off all: Do you know how trailers play up games and make it seem like it's going be awesome, and then it sort of sucks?This game is the opposite. The trailer is underwhelming, the game itself is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. The music, art design, writing, and creativity of this point-and-click, is just lovely. It doesn't get enough publicity, and every chance I get I recommend this game to people.Aside from slight glitches in the game at times, I don't really have anything to complain about with this game. The puzzles are really unique and satisfying, the music is haunting and ambient, and the character design is creepy, but seriously grows on you. I really love Victor as a character. But if you really need a reason to play this game other than the fact that it's engrossing and downright beautiful, then just know you can be the king of some talking pumpkins.			",12,19,0,6,2,0,0

												This game has been in development for about 5 years now, so far 5 out of the planned 6 chapters have been finished. The reason it has taken so long is that the entire game is being built -by hand- with real materials like cardboard, clay and wood. It is absolutely beautiful, as you can probably imagine. Not only that, but the story AND the writing are both terrific! I'd say that almost all the puzzles hold some sense of logic to them, but as this is a game about entering people's dreams, it somewhat fittingly DOES start to lose some of it's sanity with it's puzzles (as is the case with all adventure games unfortunately). I had to use a walkthrough a few times to complete it, but that's the case with pretty much any adventure game I've ever played...I absolutely recommend playing this! It's not finished yet, and based on how long it's taken to get the first 5 chapters out, it seems like we'll be waiting a while yet for the ending, but it's a wait very much worth enduring!

												This is definitely one of my favorite games. It's a point-and-click made with stop motion effects and it looks excellent. The stop motion is far from a gimmick as it adds so much atmosphere to the experience. The puzzles aren't going to break your brain, but they will slow you down for a bit and make you think. The story is fascinating and well-delivered. I played and completed up to the third chapter (that's all there was at the time) and haven't gone back, because I want to play the entire experience once it's finished. Let me tell you, waiting is painful.If you're a fan of point-and-click adventures or are just looking for a different kind of game, this is for you. You won't be disappointed.

												10/10This is my favorite game on steam.  I am not the least bit anxious and very excited for the last two chapters.  Also, I recommend this game even at full price.Pros- immensly detailed hand made set- rich atmosphere- a soundtrack you want to download- a story that is surreal and beautiful- originalityCons- the game is unfinished			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I guess we have all experienced it: starting a game we have bought in the spur of a moment during a summer sale, maybe along with a dozen others that turned out half-okay, half-not-so-okay, smugly thinking to ourself, ""Well, let’s get this over with, shall we?"" - only to find ourself blown away and feeling like a whole new person two nights later, albeit one that needs a shower and some fresh air. Like when you start watching Doctor Who because you have nothing else to do and end up building full-scale TARDISes for your cats, knocking four times every darn time before entering a room and telling your friends how much you’ve grown as a person watching it. But to be honest, no point and click adventure game has done this to me in quite the epic scale as The Dream Machine has. And having grown up with an older sibling with access to Leisure Suit Larry and Monkey Island, that is saying something.So after half-heartedly convincing myself to try it, I almost startled a bit when I found myself laughing at the introduction to chapter 1. I mean an authentic laugh, not the face people make while typing “lol”. The game continued to surprise me with what unfolded to be an incredibly beautifully made little world full of amazing detail and a unique artistic style. And while it was cozy within its little walls, with its jazz and ambient music, I found it to be packed with possibilities for exploration.So the playdoh-dollhouse really brought the childhood memories on their way. But what really gave me that sense of ""this feels like the first time I've ever played a PC game"" and “this is the way I actually see things when I don’t think about it too much”, was how well the shape and sound of the game were complemented with its storytelling and dialogues. The dialogues, because they showed a truthful yet non-judging and loving understanding of human nature. And the storytelling, because it managed to remain relaxing and innocent throughout the game while at the same time consistently mounting in suspense and surrealism. And in more than one instance one has to flatout admire the way it shows things in such a truthful manner that is rare in computer games: that people sometimes do things that seem dark and morbid, but then they are genuinely sorry and apologize; or that the elderly lady from next door with her teapots and doileys at some point of her life did have a sex life, such as it was.The makers of The Dream Machine have taken all those little impressions of life that are usually limited to be experienced in the privacy of our heads, and shaped them into something that can be shared - not as a clever book on psychology, but as a wonderfully made game everyone can enjoy. To me, this is what makes The Dream Machine so amazing, and if it does turn out that the makers want to publish the game’s script as a clever book after all, I will totally buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

From the routinely casual life of a simple guy who rents an apartment to the philosophical conversations with decrepit statues, all will amaze you. Remember, it's a game for the point and click fans:)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can just feel the developer's love and passion radiating from the game.It is gorgeous. Nothing ever released has ever looked like this. It is clay and cardboard and little sets that were hand built and shot. So freaking cool.The game was built by a small team, and based on reviews, it seems like it has had it's fair share of bugs. I saw none of them. The team has been on top of them, as evidenced by the regular updates and the fact none of the very minor glitches I saw affected the gameplay in any way. They were too minor to even mention. I have seen worse in AAA games. Development team cares about this game, and when I played, it was solid for all five chapters. The story is unique, fun, and engaging. The main story is simple, but the complexity of the dreams is where the magic happens. There are characters even within the dreams to interact it, and their responses to the very... well, odd dream circumstances they, as figments of a dream, are in, is spot on. I find all the dialogue to be very well written and thought out. The developers avoided much of the repetition you normally see when trying to put the square key in the round keyhole. This shows a lot of care and thought when even such minor details as ""Item doesn't fit"" type messages were considered and customized for most every circumstance.The difficulty level is just right for the average adult or the clever teen (might be a bit scary for kids!). The puzzles are varied, and challenge you to think about things you have seen in your adventures and to combine them with new knowledge and items you aquire. It isn't just going room to room to solve a puzzle in each one, you are challenged to think about how the items in your inventory can interact with each other, the environment, other people, and help you achieve the task at hand.I would have missed this game if a friend didn't gift me an extra copy. It has not gotten the attention it deserves. Don't miss this game if you have stumbled across it. I can't wait for the final chapter! I actually wish I had known there was one chapter left before I began playing, and waited to play the other ones until it was released. It sucked me in before I found out, and I couldn't put it down after I started playing!Highest recommendation!			",267,75,3,33,21,2,37

												TLDR: Whoever made this game deeply and truly loves the point-and-click adventure game genre. I bought this game with horribly mediocre expectations in mind, and I could not have been more incorrect.  Truly immersive, gripping plot escapes a lot of the newer point-and-click adventure games, which consequently makes them forgettable; the ideas, while solid in concept, lack some of the critical components of cohesion that made the early point-and-clicks so personally endearing.  (e.g.:) Missing sensible characters, correct choices don’t align with player’s intuitive thinking on the problem, game lacks the atmospheric depth and detail that make it immersive, and they often include overreaching or predictable plot elements that fall somewhat flat when played. This game dodges those pitfalls like a champ.  The storyline is novel-worthy - the immersion, tone, and general charisma of the game are superlative, while managing to strike a delicate balance between elements of adventure, horror and comedy. The (very) innovative and well-executed use of claymation lent profoundly to the overall ambiance and tone of the game. Well-tailored, organic dialogue coupled with a streamlined and easy-to-use interface make the gameplay seamless.  Normally trading action buttons for a one-click method can trivialize the puzzles or can make the puzzles almost too abstract in an attempt to provide some challenge, but this (pleasantly) was not the case.  The developers tuned and paced the game well by balancing the simpler puzzles with more conceptually challenging ones, to the extent that brute force never feels like the only viable tool in solving the problem at hand. I don’t like to compare the newer adventure games to the genre-defining point-and-clicks of the 90’s, but in terms of the game’s ability to engage and captivate you as the player, it’s secured a spot in my personal hall of fame next to games like King's Quest, Monkey Island, and Day of the Tentacle.  I can’t wait for Chapter 6.			",15,86,0,3,2,0,6

												Oh boy, would I recommend The Dream Machine. I've just recently gotten into point-and-clicks and I think this just set a high standard and it's going to be hard to find a game that beats it. The wait for Chapter 6 is going to be painful, especially because the devs post teasers on their Twitter.  As an artist, this is a game to appreciate, and as someone who enjoys 'darker' art, it's a smorgasbord. Reasons why you need it: + Devs are very responsive to cries for help with glitches+ Art style is incredible and obviously takes a lot of work+ Puzzles are really tough+ Puzzles are innovative and different+ Chapter format makes it easier to appreciate in moderation instead of doing a binge+ It's easy to bingeThere are some little glitches here and there, but your love for the game will overpower them. Community for this game is great as well. There are no cons, really. Although, I would love to see some dynamic backgrounds.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I called the removal man in-game in a surveillance room while spying on him on a monitor and watched on the monitor (one of nine on screen at the time) as he actually picked up the phone and answered. It wasn't even part of the plot. The attention to detail is immense and admirable.The puzzles are often difficult but not impossible, the tone is both dark and comic. I haven't been this impressed with a pure, puzzle solver point and click game since Grim Fandango and Monkey Island.If this sounds anything like something you might like, give it a shot. As many people have already said, it deserves more recognition.			",194,70,4,33,26,4,27

At this time episodes five and six have not been released and as research has uncovered it took almost 2 years for the fourth episodes final release but if history repeats itself it will be worth the wait.

												This was one of many games I bought during a Steam summer sale and can I say how glad I am that I did? The Dream Machine has easily become one of my favorite games, if only because of the obvious love and care the creators have given in crafting it. And it really is craftmanship! It's a beautiful game, with every little detail telling a story. It really stands out from your run of the mill point and click game. I was hooked immediately by the unique and intriguing visuals, and the fascinating story and puzzles kept me playing. The music and sound design are top notch, immersing you in whichever dream world you're occupying. It's challenging, but not impossibly so, quirky with a delicious dark undertone, funny in all the right places, and full of things you never knew you wanted to see. From a ship poulated by a dozen versions of you to an apartment where time and space are determined by the photographs you find and rearrange within it, each new dream is like a whole new experience, with different and unique characters, new locations that are a feast for the eyes, and new puzzles and mechanics that keep that classic point n click gameplay feeling fresh and new. There's so much more I could rave about but I guess it's one of those things where I gotta say ""you just HAVE to try it!"" I just gotta find out how to give the developers more of my money since I got it on sale! Can't wait for Chapter 6!!			",31,14,0,3,1,0,0

												Just add this to the list of things that prove that video games are art.This game has some of the most intriguing, gorgeous, adorable (and in many instances disgusting) designs ever contructed.  The art style is like if the film ""Mirror Mask"" were made into a game.  And the plot is just as gorgeous and surreal.  ""The Dream Machine"" is like the ultimate indie game.  You play as Victor Neff, a self-proclaimed ""handsome"" man, who has just moved into a strange new flat with his pregnant wife, but things get strange very quickly when your wife notices the landlord acting really weird.  I will not spoil any of the plot.  It is a game you must see to believe, but if you can believe it, there is in fact a Dream Machine in the game.Many players who have received this game negatively because of the short nature of the first two chapters (which can potentially both be completed in under two hours combined) are wrong in assuming because of this, the whole game is very short.  It is not, in fact.  By chapter 3, the length of each chapter exceeds 2 hours (the fifth chapter took over 3 (almost 4) hours to complete as was by-far the longest and most complex).  And yes, each chapter's puzzles are more intricate and complex, making the difficulty just right for players who need to adjust to the weirdness levels this game pushes out. And also remember, a short game is not a bad game.  There are point-and-click adventure games that can be beaten entirely within a half-hour, but they are brilliant.  So if you find yourself getting through ""The Dream Machine"" very quickly, do not equate that with it being a bad game.The first two chapters are there to get the player's feet wet with how this game is going to present itself.  It's really surrealistic, thus it needs to demonstrate how the puzzles are going to work and the imaginitive ways to solve them.  (Hopefully, without spoiling much, I will give you an example.  In Chapter 2, there is a character that you have to talk to but he doesn't speak clearly at all.  The problem is one of his vocal cords is bent. The solution is to remove the cord and bang it with a hammer until it is straightened. Then the character will speak clearly).  Hopefully that was a good example of how unconventional the puzzles are in the game.And the puzzles are very well implimented.  There were times, however, when it is so unclear what to do, clicking everything on everything becomes a method to get through the game.  I only found this problem on Chapter 5 (which was a huge chapter with a lot of map screens).  The level was much darker than the others making it a bit difficult to see items that needed to be picked up and characters were not clear in what they needed from Victor making it difficult to understand what to do, though I do know the developers are still updating the game very regularly fixing this and that, so the problems with Chapter 5 may very well be fixed in a couple of months.The atmosphere in the game is brilliant, with a slow build to the weirder things (the ending of Chapter 5 was by far the strangest thing) with subtle music and an even mixture of a serious tone from the characters mixed with a humourous tone.  There were two parts that had me laughing out loud: a part with these pumpkins, and a part with a knight in armour.The artwork of the game is something to behold.  Looking at each screen on the game and noticing the tiny details the developers put in give the game an extra dose of appreciation.  They clearly care about this game (especially since it's been in development for almost a decade).  Regardless of people disliking the game because they think it's grotesque, I think it's beautiful and I truly wish there were more games (let alone stop-motion films) in this style.

												The Dream Machine is one of the best point and click games I've played in years. The stop motion style clay graphics add a great charm, the story is whimsical and fun, and the game is completely engaging. It's unique, beautiful, and fun. I hesitate to provide any of the story as exploring the game and experiencing it as you play is very rewarding. I've had the game since before Chapter 4 was completed and have anxiously looked forward to the final chapter being released so I can play the game through, from the beginnning, in its entirety. Highly recommended for point and click adventure fans, fans of games with great aesthetics, fans of Will Vinton Claymation studio, and those who enjoy a fun fantasy adventure done well.

												The claymation intrigued me, so I decided to dive right in.The point-and-click is essential to this game. Your main goal is to explore and find solutions. The game gives you just enough of information to figure out the puzzles on your own without being too ridiculously difficult. Sometimes you'll get stuck, but don't abandon the game. Take a break for about half an hour and try again. A solution will be found.I love the claymation because it is clearly a labor-intensive gamestyle, but very very worth it. The dialogue can become a bit repetitive, but the story is woven in very well with real life dream theories. If you don't like puzzles, this is not the game for you. This is also not for the faint of heart. There are some very disturbing scenes in this claymation universe.			",74,59,1,4,10,1,3

												Wonderful and intriguing story about dreams in a point-and-click adventure with environments, objects and characters basically hand-made from clay, divided by 6 chapters, each one granting like 3 hours of gameplay.The first 4 chapters was already launched, and despite some delay on bring us the fourth, it seems like the fifth is coming and the sixth will not last too much for coming too. I played the first 3 chapters, and so far i got any bugs unless the Steam layer that doesn't work.The puzzles are good enough, they're reasonable and you'll not have to try combinations of objects  desperately trying to guess because of bad designing. You may found some difficult at the main/last puzzle of each chapter - they're hard, but not nonsensical.It is a collection of great and beautiful craftwork, but it doesn't try to stand by the art itself, being part of a very good story with solid gameplay, so it's a great game.If you're those who like point-and-click adventures, mostly with good stories, this is a game for you.

We the next gen of gamers and game devs are always changing for most triple A games this is better graphics, controlls, blah blah, but when we change like this although it may see amazing it isn't really changing we haven been in a cycle of makeing ""better games"" but what really difines a ""better game"" to me its the thought and creativity that goes into a games graphics mean little to nothing when you have a game with a great story amazing gameplay and beautiful stunning artwork like dream machine and personally i think that that's what make the dream machie a five star game that deseves more recognition.

												A really nice adventure game that's just emanating the love of the devs have for making it. This is clear in that its all made in claymation which is notorious for being painstaking as hell and it shows, the first episode of this game came out like four years ago. It looks really atmospheric and eerily beautiful because of the claymotion though so its totally worth it.The game's also nicely written with a likable cast and a morally gray antagonist. Some of the puzzles can be obtuse and pixel-hunty, but they're mostly fine. Definitely deserves more love and hopefully the last episode comes out next year. (A fun little bit trivia I learned was the dev for this made Gateway 2, a flash game I played years back that I thought was neat.)			",218,242,2,31,19,2,23

												After playing the demo and reading reviews I had high hopes for The Dream Machine and I certainly wasn't disappointed.The game is beautiful, the story, visuals and audio are brilliant (I would sometimes get Mr Morton's jazz music stuck in my head for hours after playing). The puzzles vary in difficulty and there were definitely times when I felt stuck, but not to the point where I didn't want to continue playing. I can't wait to see what chapter six brings!This game is a must-have for point and click adventure game fans, I would 100% recommend.			",12,32,0,1,2,0,0

												I really enjoyed this point and click game: It has a clever story, stunning images and leaves you with a bittersweet feeling. I just played the first 3 chapters so I actually don't know how it ends, but I would already recommend it to anyone who likes casual games with a fantastic plot (that maybe could pass for sci-fi). It also has some pretty weird/heavy scenes but since it is all made with cardboard and clay it doesn't really scare anyone but absolutely creates an atmosphere of hopelessness.

												This entire series is simply incredible. Frustrated as I was through the later chapters, there is no question this this game deserves many accolades and praises.The story and art traverses so many aspects of thought and expectations. The whole concept of how people portray themselves in their mind verus how they do so in the physical world bares much investigation. There's also a lot said about voyuerism. The main statement might be that more people are looking into each other's lives than we like to think.Every scene is carefully crafted with love and attention. The dialogue is witty and hilarious. The mask-like faces of the characters gives them an oddly drab and somewhat spooky kind of roteness to their every action, thought and movement. The puppet aspect of the characters really provides a lot of layers to think about.You should get the whole package because you'll really want Chapter 6 once it's ready. Again, prepare to be very frustrated and more than likely consult YouTube videos for guidance. Hopefully you won't have to too much. Most solutions are pretty intuitive and you can find out based on the environment.			",148,37,1,15,5,0,22

												Relatively short, and at a difficult level that I would consider it very 'accessible' for the genre.I have always enjoy point-and-click adventure games, but this one is really set apart by the incredibly detailed environments and characters, all created in a physical medium.Even if you don't plan on playing the other chapters in the series, this game is worth it just to experience the novelty of what was done with the claymation.

												I'm positive on this as of chapter 1&2. The setting is interesting and makes you want to see more of the story. That is very important in an adventure game.The visiual presentation is neary perfect. Soundtrack is a good fit. One bad point is that the characters move in a weird animation (maybe it was on purpose, or maybe it is because of the carboard and clay thing), and I personally find it unpleasing.Another thing is that I like playing these game in a fullscreen, and I would love to have the option of rendering in a 16:9 format. The game seems to be tailored for windowed mode and for a more conventional square-ish screen ratio.Other than that, I would consider this game a definite buy; it has the potential of becoming a classic.

Even though it will take quite some time because of the art style, it will be well worth it. The style of this game is one of the main reasons why I like it, they handmade all the characters and scenes with clay, and it looks great. It’s very unique, and I really like that in games. I appreciate all the time and effort the creators put into the game, it’s a fun point and click, the story is enjoyable and the script is quite amusing at times. Even though there are some parts in The Dream Machine that can be quite puzzling, it’s all part of the challenge. As a whole it’s very creative. I would definitely recommend this one, it’s well worth a try if you like point and click adventure games.			",421,281,31,20,33,5,36

												Probably my favorite point and click of all time.  It's one thing to have hand drawn art in a point and click, but it's another to have these beautifully crafted real-life hand built scenes.  There is detail in there all the way to 1920x1080 (maybe more?) and truly a pleasure to look at.  Also, the puzzles all make sense and at no point do you ""rub every item in your inventory on every interactable object"" like you end up doing in some adventure games.  The story is genuinely interesting and isn't just silly, overblown, and played for gags like many other adventure games (not that that's a bad thing, just that since many other games do that it's nice to see something different).  The tutorial segment is extremely cleverly put together and really sets the tone for the whole game.  The puzzles are unique, interesting, and most importantly seamlessly integrate into the world instead of feeling a bit forced and unrelated to the world like other adventure games do (yet another towers of hanoi mini-game anyone?).

												Excellent point-and-click adventure.  The first couple of chapters were a little slow to start with but it was worth waiting for the later chapters, and it's definitely worth playing through until the end.  The choice of using a style like claymation results a very unique environment and required a huge amount of effort on the part of the developers besides, and it shows.  Localization is good.  If I had to nitpick, it would have been nice to have  recap of each chapter since I was playing new chapters after a few months' wait, but nothing's stopping me from just replaying the previous chapters.  A few bugs in the later chapters but nothing game-breaking.   Two tentacles way, way up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly amazing game. The art speaks for itself, and the soundtrack compliments the atmosphere perfectly - disturbing in a way that you can't quite put your finger on (until chapter 3, when you most certainly can). The game doesn't really show its true potential until you hit chapter 3; from then on, the puzzles (especially in chapter 5) and environments (especially in chapter 4) are top-notch. There's something wonderfully Real about the dialogue, too - it's easy to believe these characters and their stories and neuroses.			",49,20,0,8,2,0,5

												Crafted from clay and ingenuity, The Dream Machine is a point-and-click adventure through the mind. The world - or worlds as it quickly becomes - presented here is undeniably stunning, though the misshapen forms of its people and the engrossing plot at hand distract from that beauty. This is a game that demands that the urgency of the plot be forgotten from time to time in favor of stopping to take in the sights. However the novelty of its art style isn\'t the only thing The Dream Machine has to offer. Some of its puzzles are absolutely brilliant and though a few did seem to come out of left field, none felt absurd or out of place. A single mouse button takes care of all player actions making the controls very accessible, but also equally restrictive. Frustration is often born of not having enough tools to come up with a variety of possible solutions or to tell the game what you would like to do, and this is a hole The Dream Machine tends to fall into. The game is very much a work in progress. It\'s still somewhat buggy and is missing its concluding chapter, but it is very playable even without those finishing touches. The individual chapters are a bit short, but they are priced to their playtime, so it\'s hard to complain about that. Having played five out of the the six intended chapters, the story so far is satisfying, as is each chapter taken on its own, even if it\'s all currently ended with a cliffhanger.

												The art style and sountrack of the game are impressive for a two man team. Some of the puzzles kinda felt like they followed moon logic, but for the most part you can solve them with some thinking and a piece of paper. I found the dialogue when incorrectly using items to be hilarious. The game had a surreal feel to it and I enjoyed going through all of the dreams.While the time span between episode releases can lead to a loss of interest in story continuity, it didn't bother me. Its also nice that the devs read the discussions and try helping people with their problems.			",303,78,6,31,17,4,34

												I have been a fan of the point and click genre of games since the early 90s when I played them as a child. This has brought back some very nostalgic feelings and memories and I must say I love it. It makes me have to think again and actually use my brain for a video game instead of just mindless hack and slash or shoot my way through an environment. I recommend this for everyone who wants a different style of play and something to make you think I cannot wait to play the rest of the chapters.			",39,14,1,9,2,0,2

												This is an amazingly well made and gripping Indie game; especially if you like puzzles! The visual design and soundtrack of this game really cement it as a five-star game for me; whilst storyline is nice it's not always everything and The Dream Machine goes that step further by looking and sounding amazing. I can confidently advise you that this is well worth paying for, it's a lot of fun and you can see how much hard work the dev team have put into every part of it! *****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

												At the time I write this review I am partway through Chapter 5.This game will frustrate the hell out of you, but it's so worth it.Like many of these kinds of games it has puzzles that don't seem to make sense, and ""clues"" that don't really tell you anything. You will get stuck when you think you've tried everything, and even turning ""hint mode"" on won't be enough (as the ""hints"" it gives you are practically useless). There are still a few things that need to be fixed, for example full-screen mode oftens crashes or runs slowly so I haven't been playing full-screen. Because of this I've sometimes missed clues as I just can't see them very well on the small screen! And for a game that's so visually impressive it's a shame I can't appreciate it fully by having my screen covered with it.I still recommend, as the visuals are SO interesting and beautiful (and creepy!!). Without being a full-on horror game you will still feel weird and eerie playing this, you don't need jump scares because the atmosphere is enough. It really is full of dream-like imagination.I can't wait to see how this all wraps up!			",3,2,0,1,0,0,0

												The clay and cardboard graphics alone are enough to sell this unique little adventure title, but the interactions and general storyline are also fairly well done.  Add to that a haunting score and interesting dialogue, and you have the ingredients for an interesting adventure.  My only gripe is that the Steam Overlay doesn't work with this game, making it impossible to share the unique graphics that are one of the central selling points of the title.  That minor blemish aside however, the game delivers an engrossing adventure experience and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the adventure genre.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

												A unique and well-crafted surreal point and click adventure. It's striking claymation art style is a standout feature, immediately setting The Dream Machine apart from the deluge of pixel-art and grimy realism. Backing it up is an intriguing story reminiscent of Psychonauts and To The Moon and a handful of, while not hugely challenging, nevertheless interesting puzzles.  I've only played the first two chapters at the time of this review, but they left quite the impression and I'm eager to continue the series.			",109,21,0,14,6,2,6

												If the art looks cool to you and you are into solving puzzles, then The Dream Machine may just be for you.The Dream Machine is a surreal story about a couple that just moved into a new apartment. Upon unpacking and cleaning up, the couple discover an eerie note left by the previous tenant. Something isn't quite right with this place.The puzzles range from fairly obvious to complex. They start easy enough and slowly ramp up in difficulty as you progress.I only played the first two chapters as they are available as a bundle and I was quite pleased with them. I'll be looking to pick up the other chapters as they go on sale. I'm looking forward to the story.The first two chapters should take around 2-3 hours to complete.			",66,50,1,8,4,0,7

Only the first three chapters of supposed five are out now. The developers are rather coy about if/when the next ones will be made. It's a shame because the story is just picking up by the end of chapter three. Definitely wait until the game is finished before buying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #50 - The Dream MachineBefore I started my series of reviews, I hadn't really played much in the way of adventure games.  But, it's been nice seeing a resurgence in this genre, and now I've had the opportunity to play through several adventure games.Going in, I didn't know anything about The Dream Machine.  So playing it felt a little like going to a movie that you didn't see the trailer for, and you don't even know what genre of movie it is.   And I'm glad I did that because I feel like I've just watched the opening act of a mystery, so not knowing anything ahead of time definitely added to that sense of mystery.I won't spoil anything about the story, other than to say I enjoyed the first chapter, which I just had time to finish in my first hour of play.  The story kept me engaged enough that by the time I noticed the time my playthough was nearly over.  I think this is one of the better compliments you can give a game when it has that ability to suck you in.The actual gameplay itself seems fairly typical for a point and click adventure game.  It involves a lot of walking around, doing some pixel hunting to find points of interest, and picking up things that you'll need to use later.  Pretty much everything I could pick up I ended up using on something, and often in ways I would not have expected.  Besides the ""use this item on this thing"" type of puzzle, I also played a different kind of puzzle that involved turning knobs on a machine.I did occasionally have some trouble lining up my mouse cursor on the right pixel to pick something up, but it didn't happen often enough to be really annoying.  Also, when you move the mouse to the top of the screen, a bar will pop down with your inventory, but sometimes this interferes with you trying to point to something at the top of the screen.  Other than these couple of minor annoyances, I didn't really run into any problems with the game.Besides the story, I also enjoyed the art style.  Most of the adventure games I've played have an animated, cartoon like art style.  But this game has a claymation inspired art style which really sets it apart.  I can really tell a lot of work went into the art for this game.  The characters look great, and so do the backgrounds.  Everything has this hand crafted look to it.I'm not sure if the following chapters are any longer to play, but I could see some potential concern about the game being relatively short (for what you pay for it).  There are 6 chapters total (but the 6th is not out yet).   I wouldn't be surprised if the follow on chapters take a little longer than an hour to get through.  For me personally it's not an issue, as I think the game is worth the price, and would happily recommend it.			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												Review timeThis is a rare gem of a game in the point and click world, how often do you see a hand animated PnC game made out of cardboard and clay? Not often, and this one I remember was a very enjoyable and surreal experiance, however it's been a year since I played because chapter 6 isn't out at this time of writing.I love the story, very deep with interesting characters, and a machine in which dreams can become anything, everything, and damned scary! I'd recommend this to anyone who loves classic PnC with a modern and arty twist.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great traditional-style point-and-click game with lovely (although a little odd) characters and background rendered in paper and clay. I found the story enthralling and the gameplay challenging, but not impossible - most of it is based in logic (as well as a little old-school point-and-click logic!).The atmosphere and storytelling was atmosphetic, the characters stood out, and the fact it looks great and the interface is easy to use (and mistakes cannot be easily made, unlike with some games) made is so easy and fluid to play. The story is based around an interesting combination of ideas on dreams, philosophy and a little danger from basic-level AI thrown in for good measure. The puzzles are excellent and logical, and I found that with enough thought, pretty much all of them can be solved without too much stress.I certainly found it quite addictive, and although stuck on a couple of puzzles, I got through it relatively unscathed - and it was a lot of fun to work the puzzles out; they gave quite the sense of achievement!This is highly recommended (in fact, it was actually a very enthusiastic recommendation to me) to point-and-click enthusiasts, puzzlers, and anyone who wants to try something with deep atmostphere, great characters, and an intresting, entertaining story. It also helps that it looks pretty great too!After playing Ch. 1 + 2, I'll certainly be getting Chapters 3-6 now for certain!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As a child of the 90s I was a huge fan of Maniac Mansion, The Sierra games, especially King's Quest VI, DAy of the Tentacle, Same & Max, etc.  This game stirred a lot of those old emotions and puzzle solving satisfaction that caused me to fall in love with the genre.  Not to mention, the aesthetic is fantastic.  Funny, smart, philisophical, pleasure to look at.  One of my favorite games.			",53,24,0,23,8,0,8

												If you are a fan of point and click in the slightest, you need to do yourself a favor and play this game. On its point and click gameplay alone I would recommend this title but where it really shines is the stylized graphics. I love stop motion claymation and this is some of the best I've seen. Every screen is handcrafted and carefully detailed and I find the rarity of claymation to add to the overall theme of exploring dreams. Some puzzles are a little harder than I care for and chalking up some of these solutions to ""LOL DREAM LOGIC"" gets tired after a while. As a whole the game is great and you'd be doing yourself a favor experiencing this little adventure.			",270,48,1,28,16,5,17

												The Dream Machine is a really typical point and click game, with some puzzles here and there (that actually are good), and a very interesting and even somewhat dark story.It is not finished at this moment, as it launches by chapters. It lacks a chapter, and the chapters may be fast to finish, but it can still be hard to figure some things out. Really, it really triggers your brain to think and go beyond a reasonal thinking. The art style is actually interesting and the game is very compelling with it. It looks like clay figures who are a little bit deformed and all, even looking like having masks and things like that. The characters can be pretty strange, also the story, but it actually is part of the fun of the game. It has some dense atmosphere, most of the part, so you'll get into the game.When the game finishes with the sixth you can buy it, and, well, the bundle is more recommended since it can be expensive to buy the chapters alone. If you buy the bundle, the sixth chapter will also be available for you. But, it still does not have any date to launch. So be on alert and only buy it if you don't mind waiting for the last chapter.			",1078,435,19,150,102,11,152

												The tl;dr - Great game, unique art style, challenging puzzles. It's provided me hours of entertainment per chapter. I think it's worth it.The full rundown:The game's unique art style of clay and cardboard was honestly a bit unnerving at first. As it progressed I began to appreciate it more and more. The art style really sets the tone for the game. The music and sounds are also really great and well-chosen. Not overly repetitive, I like to listen to it.The game play is simple and easy to navigate. There's a lot to explore. The puzzles are not always easy! They keep you thinking and I'll admit to getting seriously stuck and having to seek out help from the internet more than once. That being said there are plenty of resources out there to help you keep progressing.I hear the release schedule for the chapters is kind of s♥♥♥♥♥dic, but there are 5 out already. Only one left to go.I think it's worth it.			",77,36,1,11,17,0,7

												Enjoyed this game immensely. I played chapters 1-4. It's been years if not decades since i devoted time to a point-and-click adventure. I was not disappointed. Beautiful artwork, interesting, odd, and at times scary storyline. Great variety in puzzles, although some of them are downright cruel, and required me to go online to search for an answer.There are a few minor glitches and errors that will crash the game, so remember to save often.Other than that, looking forward to the rest of the chapters. Up until now, I find The Dream Machine to be a solid 9/10 when it comes to classic adventure games.			",439,170,7,61,69,7,75

												I've not finished this yet, but it is a thoroughly lovely adventure game.  Despite initial impressions the art style is great, as is the sound.  Puzzles are bang on the classic mix of inventory combination, conversation, and block pushing that i like.  The depth of each chapter seems to be increasing as the game goes on, with number 5 convincing me that this is a game that i'll remember.  The script, although (perhaps because) it's not voice acted, stands out especially in comparison  to other modern adventure games of its quality.Most of all though, the game has an appropriately dreamlike, unsettling vibe, which nonetheless never quite gets in the way of how nice, and comfortingly solid, it looks and sounds.

												This game is sweet! I've only played up through chapter 4 so far, but I give it 5 stars. The artwork is beautiful, the story line is deep and intricate, and in reading the updates, the creator(s)' personality is upbeat and cool. It's truly challenging but not so much that I'd give up and never touch it again. I'll likely play through it again once I finish it, whereas most point-and-clickers are a one-time play for me. Thanks for a great game! :)			",7,8,0,1,2,0,0

												Comfortably designed, cleverly written, and a visual marvel.Beautiful game. Sets are beautifully photographed and worth all the wait. I feel genuinely lucky to have found this, and guilty to have found it when I did, greatly discounted. Very manageable but true to the adventure game way in its inventory. Puzzles are fair. There are either amusing or disturbing comments on most things when attempting to force item interaction. As for the themes and my response, as a skeptic of that certain and too often reinforced mystic attitude towards dreams, I didn't expect the game to make me any sort of believer. Not quite, still, but by this game's insight and the context of its own beauty, I feel changed, though always I had to acknowledge the influence our dreams have on us in recollection, or the reliability and vividness of our recall. However dreamy the experience was, *this* ""recollection"" is assuredly *definite.*			",59,26,1,6,2,2,12

												I picked up the first two chapters of this game expecting it to be a little wonky adventure that I would pick up and put down here and there to enjoy some odd visuals and a promisingly unique story. As it turns out The Dream Machine was bit more pleasingly dark, strange and required a bit more thought from me than I initially bargained for. Before I knew it I had flown through Chapters 1 and 2 and was purchasing the rest of the chapters to play as soon as possible. The storyline has a low burn in the beginning but by Chapter 2 things dive into the deep end of possibilities for the storyline and do not disappoint. I was daft myself for picking up just 1&2 initially myself the game is wonderful.			",385,138,5,94,32,4,35

												9/10 one of my favorites, why?pros:-The story is great-the game has a creepy feel to it that just almost makes you uncomfortable.-every chapter has a different feel and mechanic to it so, it makes you feel like you're starting a new game every time-its just incredibly beautifull and charming because it's handcrafted.-the puzzles are very original and just the right amount of dificult, which is very hard in my opinioncons:-the movement is pretty silly-i did get some glitches and the game crashed on me once or twice. i think they were fixed pretty quikly though-took a while to bring out some of the chapters, i guess it doesnt really matter that much since the last chapter is about to be brought out.-wasnt really a fan of the maze in chapter I, it got a lot better from chapter IIat the end this game leaves you thinking about the story's that went on and how much fun you have. i hope i forget the puzzles soon so i can play the game again.

The Dream Machine ReviewPoint and click adventure and puzzle game.The Dream Machine is a fantastic little indie game made entirely from clay and cardboard. How awesome is that? The storyline is awesome and I feel that there is a constant dramatic and emotional ambience. Great character development, too. Whilst I have not yet finished it, I really do think this game is absolutely brilliant. A point and click adventure game with some parts of puzzle, too. Loving it so far! I acknowledge that this review is pretty miniscule but that is because I am not even close to completely this game just yet, not even the first chapter.			",338,91,18,24,36,3,29

												This game is eerie, creepy, and charming at the same time. The storyline is compelling if not somewhat predictable. The art, made completely out of cardboard, is creepily endearing. Somewhat dark and morbid, this game is quick paced and filled with puzzles that are shuffled about so following a walkthrough won’t work, you actually have to think a little yourself. The music is amazing and the characters are all touching in their own way. The only complaint I’d honestly have with this game is a lack of release dates. It’s been “under development” for years and I’d love to finish this game. Here’s to hoping this twisted little masterpiece gets finished soon.

They stayed challenging but not so difficult that I had to constantly look at a walkthrough to progress. It makes you want to keep playing more! The story is so interesting. In the beginning it is quite a mystery as to what is going on... Overall I enjoyed it so much and I cannot think of anything to complain about thus far! I cannot wait for chapters 5 and 6!

												Played the first 3 episodes for now, waiting for the rest to be released.It's a pretty good adventure game. The premise (dreams) has a lot of potential.A couple of the puzzles were of the tedious trial-and-error kind, solved by process of elimination. And the game sometimes blocked you from taking the obvious path, just because you skipped something in between.But for the most part they are the right mix of logic and thinking outside the box. Largely quite enjoyable!And of course the game looks amazing. Made entirely with modeling clay and cardboard, I spent as much time admiring each set piece as I did solving its puzzles.Even with 3 chapters released, I felt it was a bit short. I hope the two remaining chapters will be longer.			",991,397,39,52,75,8,39

												What a remarkable gem of a game this is!If you're a fan of P&C and puzzle games, just buy the game. Its a no-brainer.The story is solid and gripping, and it leaves you on the edge of your seat the whole way through.The artwork and animation is fantastic, and the game just looks gorgeous. Simply beautiful.The soundtrack is amazing, and it compliments the game perfectly. Its understated, but powerful.After plowing through the first four chapters, I simply can't wait for the last two.

												This game is really good for what it is. It has a good story and it is really deep. The game is an adventure point and click game with a deep weird story. The worse thing about it is that instead of buying the gmae you have the get the game in short chapeters. kinda like what they did for hl2 but not as well. The game is been out for 3 years and it's still not complete so i guess chapter 6 is the new hl3. :D I like this game but i hate it. 8/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												I didn't know what I was getting into when I bought the bundle and oh man, I am so glad I did. Was a huge joy to play. It has a creeping sense of dread that builds on you as the story progresses. Part of my personal fascination with this game is the art style. Thought it looked so wacky when I skimmed through the thumbnails of games in the Steam store, it almost deterred me from even looking at the description. I'm so glad I didn't judge a book (or game) by its cover. The dedication and love the creators have for their craft is unreal. Found certain puzzles to be a bit difficult to solve, but I'm chalking the cluelessness on my part to my inexperience with point-and-click games (games in general). It makes you think about the the story, characters, and gameplay simultaneously and that's a total win in my opinion.			",4,17,0,0,1,0,0

												Well the reviews are set so that I can only review against Chapter 1 and 2.  That's unfortunate.  This is a game that gets better as you play, so far Chapter 3 was incredibly dense and interesting, and Chapter 4 is set up to be much the same.TL;DR Version:  10/10, would ruin my wife's dreams again.I love point and click adventure games.  They are what I grew up with, and at the end of the day, it's the format I'm most comfortable with.  I've spent my time in WoW, and I loved it, and I recently spent two full working weeks worth of time beating the Witcher 3's storyline, and all of these are great experiences.  None of them can take me back to my childhood, the kernel of my gaming self, like a solid point and clicker.  And this is one of them.  This is an excellent point and click adventure game.  That's all it is, mind you, it's nothing more than that.  It's just what it's advertising -- and in its genre, it is absolutely superior.  The story is compelling, even for an old guy like me, the mechanics are fine, and the puzzle strength really isn't that hard if you're willing to stick with it.  Yes, we only have walkthroughs for the first two chapters.  Thats ok.  Play around a bit and you WILL figure it out, and it will be way more rewarding than just reading through a walkthrough and beating the game in a few hours.  I promise, you can do it.  Remember when we had to order a hint book from Sierra back in the 80s, and by the time we got it, eight weeks later give or take, we figured out the puzzle?  There's no need for a hint book here.  Just keep at it.  And you'll feel a lot smarter when you figure it out all by yourself.This game explores a thing that a lot of people have said a lot about, especially while in an altered state, the Dreamscape.  Ah, the Dreamscape, the Holy Grail of all game creators.  Quite possibly, the next bastion of virtual reality, if we really pick the thing apart.  Go read this review again on an energy drink or two.  If we had some sort of device that would let us fall asleep and log in while dreaming, lets be honest, that's another 6-10 hours a night we'd get to game.  That's all I'll tell you about the plot.  You don't need more.  Play the game.  It's fantastic. ",281,106,4,48,22,2,34

												If there was a mixed feelings review I would totally put that, but...there isn't, so I'm going with reccomend. First of all, the gameplay is very fun, and the puzzles are usually fairly easy. But, my problem is that some of them don't work for me. The first two chapters are fine, but the rest (which are all paid DLC) have problms that stop me from playing the chapter completely.  But other than that, it's a marvelous game with a ort of eerie yet amazong art style and atmosphere, logicle puzzles, and fun gameplay. The glitches just need to be fixed.			",59,34,0,4,4,0,4

												A charming little point-and-click adventure.  While there are better genre titles out there, the passion the developers have for this game is clear; physically hand-sculpting and filming the visuals is a labor of love.  The imaginative story has me curious how the final episodes will play out.			",131,40,1,18,10,0,32

												Very fun and surreal. The humor is pretty funny and the horror is... actually kind of disturbing. While I can't say the dream portions opperate on actual dream logic, they can certainly make you forget that it doesn't, and figuring out the internal logic of each individual dream is pretty fun in itself. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a kick out of the subtle The Prisoner shoutout in Chapter 1.I am, however, struck by how lucid the various dreamers are once you find them, not to mention weirdly capable of taking the whole bizzare scenario in stride. Then again, considering the sorts of things I'm able to take in stride in my own dreams that would weird the hell out of me in real life, I suppose they aren't quite so lucid after all. But this is neither the time nor place for those stories.My only complaints are that A) a few of the puzzles are terribly inconveniant to complete, even after you've figured out the solution, you're given a hell of a runaround to actually put that solution into action. And B) the chapters are over too quickly. I hope the next two chapters are longer.			",30,25,0,3,2,0,0

												This game is amazing. The art is great--it looks even better than in the screenshots. The game is legitimately disturbing and captivating. Claymation is already unnerving and they've managed to make it even creepier as the game progresses. I am not easily creeped out nowadays, but this game has managed to do so, all the while posing some interesting philosophical questions. One of the other reviewers suggested that its atmosphere is like a Jeunet film and I agree--mixed in with a bit of the Cell and Sunshine! Do yourself a favor and buy this now!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm so glad this game was included in an advertised bundle because I might have never heard of it otherwise.I'm loving this game.  I'm currently in Chapter 4.  The visuals are unique and creepy in a good way.  I'm really enjoying the settings and the story, which compels me to move ahead to find out what happens next.  The puzzles are just the right degree of difficulty, and none of the solutions have been absurd like in some other adventure games.I would definitely recommend this game to fans of the point-and-click adventure genre.Update on July 12, 2015: I just finished Chapter 5, and it is definitely the best chapter.  Every screen is a joy to behold, and there are a couple of surprises.  I got stuck two or three times in Chapter 5 but persevered and managed to complete the chapter without consulting a walkthrough.  The ending was great and has me eagerly awaiting Chapter 6.

												It's not often I find myself playing a game so good it starts seeping into my own dreams. Great range of puzzles and problem solving opportunities. Majority of the solutions are logical, but require you to think some what outside of the box. The art is brilliant. I don't think I've ever played a game that used stop motion style animation to bring it to life (and so effectively!), and the story telling is completely on point; I love a plot twist I can't predict. 10/10, can't wait for chapter 6.

												A great point and click game with a unique and painstakingly hand-crafted setting. The backgrounds are immersive and really atmospheric. At first the characters creeped me out as they have no eyes, but the creepiness works well with the game overall which is often quite dark.The puzzles are challenging enough but not frustrating. They make logical sense despite the fantastical places you may end up in, which makes the puzzle solving satisfying.  It has a good plot also - I found that I couldn't stop in between chapters as I just wanted to know what happens next (luckily the first 5 chapters were out when I bought it). The writers have done a good job of creating tension and uneasiness as well as characters that you actually care about. Delving into dreams opens up some crazy worlds and also deep back stories.My only gripe would be some bugs in the latest chapter such as the game skipping you forward to a later point if you have loaded up an older save. Thankfully the game is constantly updated as the bugs are fixed.Overall a well made, imaginative and immersive adventure game. Hopefully it won't be too long before the final chapter is out!

Simply a beautifully made game!Some of the puzzles are a bit abstract, but brilliant when you get that a-ha feeling after figuring out how to progress the game. The games story is very well told, and the clay and cardboard art is presented beautifully as well as functionally. The chapters which are still being added to the game are cohesive to the game as a whole, yet still bring new and unique aspects of gameplay to the table in each new installment. The dialogue, which admittedly fills a lot of the game, is well written, relatable and humorous. This fully reflects onto the slew of different supporting characters one meets throughout the game, all of whom I found relatable and likeable. I was actually interested in interacting with them and learning their individual stories. Overall I would characterize this game as a very artistic piece; brilliant if you're into visually beautiful point and click games with solid stories and puzzles that make you think outside the box. I was quite taken with it.			",26,13,0,3,4,0,4

I honestly DEMAND that you play this if you love any kind of story game. Only thing is the puzzles  are SUPER tough at times but they make you feel so satisfied once you've figured them out. a game like this may not come around again for another 10 years.

												This game is interesting and original. One odd aspect is that the sets were actually built and filmed, giving the game a unique artistic style. This notion of uniqueness also plays through as it explores some interesting and occasionally creepy themes. The puzzles are mostly straightforward, the story is engaging to the point of gripping. The only drawback is that the last part isn't ready yet, so patience is required. Highly recommended for people looking for unique games.			",130,218,0,17,36,0,13

												The Dream Machine is a classic point-&-click adventure made out of clay and cardboard.I just finished Chapters 1 & 2 and I really like it. The puzzles are sometimes very challenging but always 'logical' and well-thought-out. The backgrounds and characters are beautifully handcrafted. I woudn't use the term 'stop-motion' because there's not much stuff animated, but on the other side there are tons of things to interact with and Victor always has reasonable comments for that. The visual style reminds me of Tool's music videos: Surreal, symbolic, a bit dark and kind of phylosophical.			",222,99,4,12,17,2,25

												I can't actually recommend this game enough. If you like point and click or puzzle games of any kind I would recommend buying all of the chapters right now. The composition is pretty odd. The story is strange, the setting is strange. Everything is strange, but it's brilliant! I can't imagine how someone comes up with the idea for this game. This game is thourough, well thought out and composed. Even after playing the whole thing, I could do it all over again and still love it.			",4,18,0,0,1,0,0

												""Weird, creepy, and slightly off-putting; I loved it!"" 8/10As with many of the games in my Steam catalog, I got this one in a bundle. Not being a huge fan of 'point and click' games I decided to give 'Dream Machine' and chance one rainy afternoon when I was bored with the usual third or first person shooters, and was pleasantly surprised with my discovery. For starters, the artistic direction that was chosen for this game suits the tone of the story perfectly and does nothing but add to the overall creepiness factor of the characters and the setting. The game is also pretty challenging at times and really makes you think. I almost felt like a detective while playing. I also found it refreshing that the game was broken up into several different chapters, each entirely different than the one that preceded it. Overall, the stories here are pretty interesting for a few hours, and for five dollars I can recommend 'Dream Machine' to those who are at this page right now, interested in this game, considering a new addition to their Steam catalog.

												This evaluation goes for the five first chapters, since the sixth is not out yet : The most beautiful point and click game out there, no question about it. I would really want to see a documentary on how they worked with the clay and the animation. And it's not just looks : the puzzles are hard but not impossible (two or three of them are satan's♥♥♥♥♥♥hard though), the storyline is captivating, and the atmosphere is dark and nostalgic.

												What should I say? I love this game! And there are not many games which I would describe like that, but there is simply something absolutely fascinating about it. The art style is as unique as the story and I also think, that most of the gameplay holds the perfect balance between difficulty and logic. There is that one thing because of which I know, that it is a good adventure game. I never know the answer as the game asks for one, but I don't even think about looking it up, because it is so great to discover it by myself. That should be part of every adventure. Still, only a few of them ever handeled that! ;)			",52,10,0,7,2,0,2

												Over the past couple years, I’ve become increasingly interested in the point-and-click genre. As a result, I’ve been buying such games whenever I can get them for a very low price. Of the ones I’ve played, The Dream Machine definitely ranks near the top. Your character, Victor Neff, has just moved into a small apartment building with his pregnant wife. He soon discovers something ominous happening in the building, and must travel through the dreams of his neighbors in order to stop it.On the surface, the story does seem rather simplistic, and it is, to an extent. However, each dream you visit has its own story, and it is in these mini-stories where the game truly shines. These dreams range from bizarre, to sad, to creepy, and everywhere in between. There seems to be much more of an emphasis on showing, rather than telling. Simply traversing the dreams of your neighbors is enough to give you insight into their personalities. Another point of note with this game is that it is all crafted by hand, with clay and cardboard being the mediums of choice. The environments are, simply speaking, beautiful, and realizing it was all handmade gave me an even greater appreciation for the game. It also adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game, as many times characters are made to be rather grotesque in appearance.Gameplay is your standard point-and-click style. You explore the environments, picking up items and using them to solve puzzles. The puzzles vary in difficulty, with some being quite easy and others being obnoxiously difficult and lacking in any sort of intuitiveness. And while the puzzles can be frustrating and take a while to solve, it is never so bad as to be game-breaking in the slightest.TL;DR: The Dream Machine is one of the most incredible point-and-click games I’ve played. The atmosphere is truly unsettling, the environments are delightfully surreal, and the story is surprisingly engaging and had quite a bit of depth. The puzzles can sometimes be frustratingly difficult and there is no voice acting, but the good far outweighs the bad. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys point-and-click and/or surreal games. ",28,66,0,7,6,0,12

												Oh boy! The Dream Machine is possibly the best point and click game I've played since Diablo 3. (oh, me!) But seriously, it has great animation and level design, which I think was the selling point of this game, and it has very well thought out dialogue and scripted events that make you guess instead of ASSUME like you would in most other linear games of the same type. It's not predictable - like you can't scroll drably through a converstaion with an NPC and say to yourself, ""Okay, so he's going to tell me to do XYZ so I can go to point A and waste all of my time, etc etc."" The storyline is very sporadic and almost spontaneous, it seems, at some points, which (I don't know about you guys) tends to keep me around - variety is a good thing. Also, very subtly creepy which is why I bought it. TDM is one of those PAC games that you finish and you, all of a sudden, feel inspired to write a short story along a similarly themed avenue. Anyway, it's good game, worth the 4 or 5 pennies it costs compared to Call of ♥♥♥♥♥♥: Modern 360 No-Scope Double Headshot. So buy it. Just buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played the first 3 episodes for now, waiting for the rest to be released.It's a pretty good adventure game. The premise (dreams) has a lot of potential.A couple of the puzzles were of the tedious trial-and-error kind, solved by process of elimination. And the game sometimes blocked you from taking the obvious path, just because you skipped something in between.But for the most part they are the right mix of logic and thinking outside the box. Largely quite enjoyable!And of course the game looks amazing. Made entirely with modeling clay and cardboard, I spent as much time admiring each set piece as I did solving its puzzles.Even with 3 chapters released, I felt it was a bit short. I hope the two remaining chapters will be longer.			",991,397,39,52,75,8,39

Not all dreams have meaning but occasionally they hide secrets to the waking world.  After moving into a new apartment the Neffs start to find out there is a lot more going on behind the scenes than they first expected.Using physically crafted objects to bring into the game gives this typical adventure game a rather unique style.  The game is lacking in a few UI/UX areas and it can be clunky to navigate around or uses items exactly as desired.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												I really enjoyed the graphics of this game. Reminded me of Grim Fandango. However I wanted a lot more story and a few less puzzles to be honest. I do not have the full game. That being said I found the game to be allright.  I did enjoy the music and the claymation is very cool looking.  If anyone is having trouble with any puzzles their is a walkthru on youtube for just this game. I kind of wish their was a meh button for games. I dont hate the game but I dont find it anything to recommend besides the graphics and music. I got this game in some kind of bundle and I cannot remember the name of it now. I found the story to be a bit on the dull side. Thats just me though. I am giving it a thumbs up because I really cannot fault the game. Its a point and click adventure game. The weird part is they made this game in flash.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												The Dream Machine is a nice, short point-and-click game with puzzles that make sense and a promising storyline. It's surprising that they managed to make reasonable graphics out of cardboard and modelling clay exclusively. The music is nice and soothing though it does give a bit of an eerie feel to the whole thing. Unfortunately, there is no voice acting, a point where I do think there is room for improvement. There are only a couple of hours of gameplay (took me about 2 h to finish both chapter 1 and 2); this, however, will probably stop being a problem once all six chapters have been released. Sure, I'd recommend this game to point-and-click puzzle lovers but be forewarned that it's a really short gameplay and you get no closure after finishing a chapter as it is ""to be continued..."".

												As with any point-and-click adventure, The Dream Machine can feel frustratingly slow at times, but the rich handmade environments give the player much to appreciate, even as their protagonist ambles across the screen.

												I've completed chapters 1,2,3 and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. The clay animation and graphics provide a unique look and feel to the game and the story is interesting and engaging that you want to find out whats next. The thing I liked most about the game was the puzzles find the sweet spot between fun and challenging. The puzzles make sense and with a little thought you can solve most of them giving you a good sense of satisfaction. Highly recommend you check this game out.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Just finished up to chapter 4. I may update my review if I wind up picking up the other parts of the series.7/10Pros:1. Good art/designs2. Puzzles can be intriguing and challenging3. Storyline is pretty good4. Some cool and unique ideas hereCons:1. Seems a little buggy and laggy at times (I had to replay some areas 3 or 4 times over due to freezing)2. Inventory was hard to access often3. Sound is pretty bad4. Doesn't have a soundtrackOverall, a pretty good point and click that, if bugs were taken care of and sound updated with possible added soundtrack, has the potential to be one of my top favorites.

												Review for chapters 1-4:I'll keep this really short despite myself, because there really is only one thing to be said: This game is ridiculously good.The visual style is mindblowing, the music is great, the puzzles are smart and mostly interesting, with occasionally even unique mechanics in later chapters. And the story is far more mature and interesting than one expects. Though if Tim Burton has taught us anything, it's that claymotion has a tendency to turn the cute into something surreal, unsettling, even horrifying at times. As the chapters progress, things go from banal to weird to scary, like in some old Stephen King novels. The puzzles also advance in difficulty, and while they are occasionally hard, they are mostly logical, and generally feel well worth the effort. Take the time to think and try out things, this isn't a game that wants to be rushed through.A really memorable, really gorgeous, really fun to play puzzle adventure. Worth every penny.

												Before I write anything else, I need to say that I can't wait for next chapters! This haunting point and click adventure reminded me of the Neverhood because of the claymation, but that is where the similarities end. The Dream Machine is disturbing and dark game about dreams and a house where something is terribly wrong. Some parts are quite relaxing, some are really creepy. The Dream Machine has many strong points like interesting characters, catching visual side and soundtrack, but the best is definitely how the game builds the atmosphere. Grab this if you can, it's worth the price, despite the chapters being quite short.			",325,161,14,48,9,1,31

												This is a pretty good point and click puzzler, with a bit of a creepy vibe.  If you enjoy those kinds of games definitely give this game a try.  The puzzles are good and a lot of detail is put into the game, especially where storyline and dialogue are concerned.  I just finished Chapter 1 & 2, took ~100 minutes with nothing looked up, no breaks, and reading as many dialogue options as possible.  It felt pretty long for a Point and Click game and did not go into the realm of needless repetition or running around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game a while ago as an episodic package after seeing it on the front page of Steam. I was taken by the look of it and I am a fan of point-and-click adventure games. I'm still very happy that I stumbled upon this game.The artwork is amazing and adds a depth to the game that complements the story very well. The few animations that are present feel natural for the artstyle even if they aren't perfectly smooth. I can appreciate the time that goes into creating each scene in this game.The story has been very captivating thus far. It builds up very well and I feel very anxious to continue the story after each chapter. Although it would be nice to have audio instead of full text, it is very easy reading with short clips of text instead of walls.The actual gameplay is pretty generic for a point-and-click adventure game with puzzles and a fair amount of walking from room to room using simple clicks for mechanics and a few drags to piece things together. For a real story-driven adventure game, though, I can deal with simple mechanics that allow for greater concentration on the puzzles, story, etc.The developers are working hard at keeping the game updated and fixing any known bugs or issues. Fortunately, I haven't come across any issues with the game, myself. They've been constantly refining and adding to the game so it's likely better to pick up a copy later in development. It has been released on more and more platforms as the game ages.The only real qualm that I have with the game is the extremely slow release of the chapters. When I purchased the game, I believe chapter 3 was just being released or had just been released. The release date for chapter 3 was October 31, 2011. To put the delays into context, chapter 4 was just released August 6th, 2013. I'm never one to mind waiting for a delay on a release for a well-refined product but that was a bit extreme. Fortunately, the developers have mentioned a release for chapter 5 in just months instead of years. Here's hoping. A miserable part of waiting so long is you have to revisit places and puzzles you've done in previous chapters; however, the game is quaint enough and easy enough to follow that forgetting shouldn't be a problem for most.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game. The price isn't bad and it does go on sale on Steam. There is a demo available on the official website that allows you to play the entirety of chapter 1 through your browser. I'd say that the demo, at least, is a must-play. http://www.thedreammachine.se/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Usually in these kinds of situations I would feel really stupid that I forgot about such a big event and couldn't get it when it was on sale. But guess what: I have no regrets! The game is one of the best adventure games that I've played recently, so it's worth the full price. Highly recommended!			",242,100,8,34,22,0,27

												The Dream Machine is a pretty simple point and click adventure game. The puzzles, like most point and click games, range from stupidly easy to esoteric beyond belief but this game manages to have a pretty consistent degree of difficulty. Unlike a lot of point and click games the puzzles reveal themselves through interacting with the environment and being patient, not many puzzles require outside help to finish or understand. The art style in this game is really interesting, I believe they used claymation to model everything in the game which makes for a really unique style. The only complaint I have about that is that the characters are horrifying, especially the wife character but then again maybe that’s the artist’s intent. The story is alright but nothing to write home about. I don’t know how to fix it but they had the ability to make something super interesting and out there, like Twin Peaks, but it just kinda falls short and feels like a semi-surreal romantic drama. Another complaint I have about the game is the length, ~45 minutes a chapter is too much to ask $5 fo. So while I enjoyed this game I don’t think I’ll pick up the last two chapters unless I see them on sale. Overall it was enjoyable, if you own it I suggest giving it a play through if you don’t I suggest wait for a sale to pick it up.			",277,111,2,39,29,1,50

												Excellent made adventure, nice graphics, cool and intelligent puzzles, although sometimes it takes a little guessing and luck to advance. Audio is not bad, but no voiceover and therefore it takes a LOT clicking in conversations.Well, I should recommend it. I bought the bundle (chapters 1-5) at a discount and so I am not complaining about the price.The reason not to recommend it, is the simple fact that after playing for a few hours I quit the game and after a restart found that all savegames are lost. Not a single one to be found anywhere!! Although I ""only"" need to restart the chapter, this is pretty annoying and totally unacceptable for a game that offers savegames.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Highly recommended!.One of the best adventure and puzzleing games around.Some puzzles are really tricky and hard to beat.Graphics are a tad odd, they seem like that kind of czech cartoons, made of plasteline or alike but, the story is really good .Only drawback: the game has available 4 of the 6 chapters so, you get waiting the final chapters like a turd.

												Interesting game with a crazy story. Can have some very tedious moments with long dialogue and long cutscenes, but has very challenging puzzles, music that seems to fit every scene, and while the graphics aren't spectacular, they look cool considering how they were done for the most part.The only real disappointing thing is that chapter 6 is still, as of yet (5/23/2015) not available. I am currently waiting with great anticipation to see how this game ends. Until then, enjoy this game. It is pretty impressive.			",128,78,0,14,16,0,24

												I liked the art direction, though some of the characters look rather creepy (the protagonist's wife, for instance, looks like something from a horror movie). The story seems to be interesting so far. The puzzles are on the light side, and the game's first two chapters seemed to be very short, I finished them in about 2 hours. On the plus side, I haven't encountered a single bug in the first two chapters, so those seem to have been fixed. Still, can't really recommend it - mainly because the game is so short for the asking price.			",22,38,0,3,4,0,3

												An excellent point-click puzzle game made with claymation and cardboard backdrops. They story will keep you going to try and find the reason behind all the strange things going on around you. My only 'con' is that Some of the puzzles (or sequences to solve puzzles) get confusing and you have to try and remember everything you've picked up on; but overall they're well done and will still keep you interested.The dev(s) are still actively developing and improving the game. For $17 it's a bargain.8\10			",135,30,4,9,8,1,8

Main Reason for Not Recommending: Too short a game for the price paid.What made me wanna play the game was the awesome demo. As a point-and-click game enthusiast, I loved the atmosphere and the graphics especially when you interacted with objects. The music was good but not the best. I defintely liked how the figurines and environment were all handmade. With that said, I had very high hopes for the rest of the game, especially considering how much it costs as well as the effort that is put into making the game since the process (I assume) would be quite meticulous. However, it did not take me long to complete these first 2 chapters which I felt lacked the interactiveness (?) the demo offered. I agree with other players who say there is a lot of dialogue, I didn't mind the dialogue but what got to me was that it made up most of the gameplay. The puzzles were not bad, though not the main focus of the game. The only reasons I'll want to play the other chapters is because of the pretty pictures and the plot which did an okay job getting me hooked. Quite uncertain if it'll be worth paying for though (in the game's defense I am quite broke ._.).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It took me 3 to 4 hours to complete Chapter 1 & 2. I actually really liked this game and I'm waiting to get chapters 3-5 on a deep discount. A very well done point-and-click series so far, but a bit on the short side. I love the artwork and storyline though. Because it is a bit on the shorter side I would recommend waiting for a discount.			",156,34,0,30,4,2,8

												My main issues with this game are that (1) it's too short for the price and (2) what few puzzles there are didn't feel very well done. I would have forgiven these two issues had the story been amazing, but alas that is lacking as well. I mean, there is a nice atmosphere and the art is very evocative but the story itself is bland. I picked it up during a sale, so I don't feel too bad about this purchase (I kinda do but not enough to want to ask for a refund because I did finish the two included chapters).

												Reminiscent of the games Amanita Design creates, And has the potential being as good as one. Unfortunately, It's held back by countless of bugs, crashes, performance issues and inconsistencies. That, coupled with the fact that the full game hasn't been released yet (At the time of writing, chapter 6 is not done) makes you feel like you're playing a early access game.The story is great, the puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly illogical and the artstyle has a lot of heart. But its techinal issues prevents me from recommending this game.			",195,76,1,8,11,0,12

												The Dream Machine is very intriguing and exciting, but then come chapter 5 and you want a refund. The chapter is so full of bugs and there's almost zero walkthroughs on internet (there are no guides on steam as of this moment) so it's really a pain to get stuck in the game because of a glitch and you think it's the way it's supposed to be. My problem in the game specifically is that I need an item, but I can't possibly get it, so I need to restart the chapter. Everyone is offering different fixes on different variations of this problem and I'm just confused.Other than this, like others mentioned here, the game crashes all the time. Seriously guys? Making a game of this magnitude IN FLASH?Overall it's a slow, glitchy and mostly boring game. I feel sorry for myself that I bought all the chapters at once.Into the bin this game goes.

												If you want to have fun and truly want an adventurous experience, then stay away from this game. There is a reason why the game's description is vague- it's because it wants to present itself as interesting and mysterious (just like click-baits for videos are done). But trust me when I tell you there is nothing truly unique about this game that sets it apart from the crowd. The puzzles are very easy, and the sad part about all of this is that you actually have to point and click A LOT before you even get the chance to do one- and when you actually do, you realize the payoff is not that great, since you were expecting something more engaging and magical. Basically, it is boring. Do not let the many positive reviews fool you- many people who end up buying the game do not want to believe that they have been cheated or that they had false expectations. But I care about TRUTH so I will say it like it is. And guys remember that you are actually giving away your money, so be careful. Take care guys, Peace!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I got the first 3 chapters on Humble Bundle, and after I played through them all, It got me coming back for the rest.The game has an enjoyable story, nice gameplay, bizarre graphics, (that I love) and everything else to make this game a must-have for point-and-click fans!Take my word for it, and get this game if it looks interesting.

												I've only gotten through chapters 1 through 3 in about 3-6 hours.  I am on the edge of my seat for #4.  If you are an point and click adventure gamer, and you are ok with a little darkness in your story, this is the game you want to play.  Loved every minute.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This piece of indie art is definetly worth your time if you're into exploring creative worlds, mysterious stories and meeting likeable characters. The first three chapters are really well done, looking forward to the remaining two.			",506,183,20,43,35,2,59

												Possibly one of my favourite games ever! Really amazing storytelling, visuals, music, and gameplay. The puzzles are complex without being absolutlely impossible, and there's no totally bizarre solutions. Just about everything makes sense within the context of the world, and it's a really engaging world for the chapters that have been released so far. If you'd prefer to play it all at once, I'd wait untill all the chapters are released: but if you don't mind the wait, buy it now for sure. My only current dislike is that there's not a huge reason to replay it due to a lack of randomly generated puzzles, but given the length of what's already out I'd say it's pretty worth what it gives. However, I still personally find it fun to replay, if only to choose dialogue options I didn't choose before, or just to see the amazing art.			",96,126,0,23,8,0,6
