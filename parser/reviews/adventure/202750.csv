												American Nightmare is a fun combat focused episode set between the original game and the not-yet-if-ever-released sequel. In this chapter Alan is trying to escape from the Dark Place by writing a script of a twisted TV show, where he can alter reality and defeat his doppelganger, Mr. Scratch as he tries to take over Alan's life in the 'real world'.The game brings some fixes of its prequel. The horrible and non-reactive controls are - fortunately - things of the past. It's a much more combat focused game, which is proven by a wast array of weapons you can find, from UZI to combat shotgun. The game introduces some - though not many - new elements and mechanics. There are new enemies like the Splitter, who splits into two when your flashlight is pointed at him. The area map and HUD are reworked, where scripts and points of interest are indicated. It's a nice addition since on the contrary of the first game, here you are encouraged to find those ""damn"" sheets of papers. You can get better weapons and it is fun, too.While Alan Wake's story was controversial but well written, the same can't be said about this chapter. It sometimes feels rushed and underdeveloped. At least the ending is much more clearer now. The part where the game disappoints the most is the level design. There three only three levels non of which are large to say the least. In addition to this, each of the levels are reused 3 times. In the frame of the story it is understandable but still disappointing. To make it clear, it is not a full fledged game, but neither is a rip off DLC. It's something between, a full game with arcade length. Alan's newest script shouldn't take longer than 4 hours to finish (6 with all the collectibles). Be aware though that normal in this game is easy compared to the prequel, so if you are up to it, try Nightmare difficulty. This can be explained by the combat focused nature of the game. You'll never have to roam trying to find ammunition and your flashlight recharges a lot faster than in the first game. There is a new game mode called Arcade Challenge. It's a simple addition where you have to survive until dawn and score as many points as you can with limited ammunition. You can squeeze a couple of extra hours out of this game mode, but don't expect dozens of hours of fun. On one side this game mode should have been in the first game, but with those horrid controls nobody would've played it.Alan Wake's American Nightmare is not a propel sequel to Alan Wake but it's a nice side story which every fan will enjoy. The game falls short in some places to the prequel (story, level design) but bests it in other areas (controls, combat).Rating: 71/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 4 hours; Played on: normal.

												Picture this, if you will, gentle reader; a man plunged into a twisted nightmare of his own design. Stalked by otherworldly horrors and mocked by his dark twin, the embodiment of the worst in him, the man must unlock the secrets of enlightenment or be doomed to repeat his mistakes again and again in his shrouded vision of strange goings on in rural America, made flesh. Did you picture it? Because that’s Alan Wake’s American Nightmare; a brazen send up of The Twilight Zone from the perspective of its hapless writer. Having not played the previous Alan Wake, American Nightmare would have to serve as an introduction to Alan’s world, and as a standalone adventure, it’s very accessible. There are some vague references to the events of the prequel, but AN can be picked up without any confusion. American Nightmare comes across a little bit like an inverse Max Payne, which is not hugely surprising, considering Remedy made them both. Even some of the stock “this door is locked!” sound effects are recognisable as the same, which isn’t to say the two titles are carbon copies, because they’re closer to distorted mirror images, aptly enough. Unlike Max Payne, Alan’s not an ex-CIA genetically engineered astronaut cowboy; he’s a writer. Or so he likes to keep telling everybody. He does precious little actual writing, unless you count the rewriting of reality, and even then he plays it safe by working off his old hits.While Max Payne was about gratuitous slow motion gun play, AN is about frantic torch shining and panicky self defence. Whereas Max Payne had surreal Twin Peak-esque horror lurking on the fringes through blurry TV sets, and the funny as hell, worst thing I can think of drug fuelled delusions of Max’s entrapment in his own narrative, these things take centre stage as Alan Wake really is trapped in a fictional world of his own devising, while his evil mirror image runs amok in the real world, the real world as we know it being snippets of radio shows and TV clips, courtesy of the murderous doppelganger channel.Despite Alan’s insistence at being a writer, his tools of the trade seem to be less the pen, and more the gun and torch. With this in mind, much of the game’s tension comes from Alan’s lack of superhuman abilities; he can’t effortlessly evade bullets, getting out of the way of danger is hard and takes precision. Nor is Alan a killing machine. His greatest weapon might just be the light, his trusty torch being the bane of The Taken; the darkness infused menagerie of slasher movie caricatures and monster mash clichés that really don’t like Alan’s annoying habit of having a pulse.The Taken, as avatars of darkness, hate the light, and this light vs. dark conflict is central to American Nightmare. In fact the ideas of motifs and symbols themselves are central to American Nightmare.So when Mr. Wake uses his miraculous ability to focus his torch’s beam, The Taken stop dead in their tracks, unless something untoward occurs, like the fiends splitting in half, which is most ungentlemanly. That The Taken need to be exorcised of the darkness protecting them before they can be dealt with adds a clever twist; the only thing standing between you and undiluted evil is an AAA battery.Having this everyday item be the only thing keeping death at bay is an effective vehicle for ramping up the pressure as it plays on and prolongs anticipation of the conflict, which is classic horror movie fare. AN excels at creating these back to the wall, dead end scenarios, where the pressure is steadily piled on, as Alan is encircled by mobs intent on redecorating the great outdoors with his insides. It’s not so easy for Alan to outrun them, though he may find shelter in one of the various rejuvenating street lamps, fonts of light that they are. If Max Payne is John Woo, then Alan Wake is John Carpenter (minus all the synths), and American Nightmare absolutely nails the horror movie atmosphere of the relentless supernatural force bearing down on the stubborn everyman, with the only thing protecting him being some flimsy mystical rules. American Nightmare isn’t outright scary, but it is stressful in a perversely enjoyable sort of way, and competently eerie. This eerie nature is due to a mix of deserted locales, the tense combat situations that constantly threaten to pop up, and the convincingly acted aforementioned video diary from Mr. Scratch, the bad Alan. For all its serial killer bravado and fear of the dark, American Nightmare’s most unsettling aspect is how subversive it is. Part of the game revolves around finding manuscripts, each entry shedding more light on the story, which neatly justifies the hunt for them. The earnest journal entries tend to be more engaging than Alan’s purple prose, and the implications that maybe he’s not actually that great a writer, until the line starts to blur between fact and fiction within the narrative, which in a completely organic way, questions the nature of sentience, reality, free will and fate, and even the role of fiction.American Nightmare features some deceptively excellent writing which dawns on the player as a revelation through the barely concealed s♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the narrator’s periodical spiel about champions of light and how ‘this could be anywhere in America’. Mechanically, AN isn’t very complex, but it is both tense and engaging. The ‘puzzles’ if you can dare call them that, seeing as there’s no actual puzzling to be had beyond ‘push button until solved’, are basically exercises in connecting Alan’s occupation to in game activities. They work thematically, but they aren’t challenging. Even the scavenger hunt for manuscripts is sign posted when you get nearby. The only real challenge in terms of the game itself is the combat, which is helpfully extended into Arcade Mode, a last stand survival mode at one of multiple classic horror movie locations, and the source of lots of replayability. Though it might be seen as hand holding, American Nightmare doesn’t want you to get frustrated exploring for paper, just like it doesn’t want you to get annoyed with overly confusing puzzles. It wants you to experience its story, it wants you to be engaged by its concepts, and it wants you to be drawn into its world (so your evil double can take your place). Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is massively repetitive. It’s repetitive. Repetitive. But that’s not a bad thing! American Nightmare is centred around a very tightly honed combat design and central motifs that are introduced, reintroduced and then exploded. Events never let up, and AN is paced without hesitation and only gains momentum as it progresses. There’s really very little time to even think about getting sick of proceedings. Its repetition is central to its theme and is never monotonous.It doesn’t hurt that the gun play is extremely well realised, with each weapon feeling distinctive, and even, dare it be said, approaching realism. The animation also, bar the occasional ‘I’m looking at the ceiling’ conversation standby is great. Overall, American Nightmare is highly polished, with a consistently good quality in everything it does. It’s not the deepest game out there, but it strikes an admirable balance between cerebral thematic content and a pinpoint focus on action and atmosphere and the relationship between the two. American Nightmare doesn’t hang around, but it doesn’t need to either. Judge this book by its cover; just make sure the cover you’re thinking of is an Americana doused, enjoyably knowing schlock-fest, with a surprising philosophic tinge.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												I enjoyed the original Alan Wake immensely: for me it is still one of the prime examples of how an action-adventure 3rd person game can be made into an exciting and scary experience. So I started playing Alan Wake's American Nightmare with high expectancies, but quickly the game let me rather down own this. American Nightmare is not really a sequel nor a prequel to the original, it's more like a standalone game on the same ""universe"", but on a much smaller scale, so in the end it felt like some sort of expansion pack to me, using the same protagonist, game mechanics and of course game engine.This engine still stands firm and delivers more than decent graphics: it's great in creating an atmosphere thanks to superb lighting, something which the original game used to immensely scaring effect. Although graphics are fine in this new installment, the actual gameplay is not. It felt almost painful to see the original game's tension and feeling of being utterly desperate while fighting off the forces of darkness turned into some Rambo-like experience. In the original game, guns, ammo and the ever-important batteries for the flashlight (sometimes it was the ONLY weapon to fight of enemies) were so scarce at moments that it almost drove me crazy, but the feeling of relief and accomplishment after finally getting further in the story, was all the more satisfying for it. American Nightmare uses the same game mechanics, but provides such an arsenal of over-powerful weapons, an almost endless supply of ammo and a flashlight that recharges in a matter of seconds. As a result of these changes, the entire gaming experience changed from an exciting horror adventure to a lacklustre shooter where I just blasted my way past hordes of enemies. Were it not for the obvious comparison to the original game, I'd probably have enjoyed American Nightmare a bit more, especially since after finishing the story there are a number of arcade-levels where the goal is just to get as many kills and as high a score as possible. These are played on fairly large and well-developed maps, and felt like playing more natural than the story.The story, perhaps the main protagonist in the original Alan Wake, is perhaps the weakest point in this newer installment. It's made coplex in an unnatural feeling way and lacks focus. But most problematic of all, it forces the player to play through the three locations (only three!!) three times, each time ""altering history"" a little bit, but in the end this feels more like a gimmick and the net result is simply too repetitve a game.I'd loved to give this game a heartily recommendation as a worthy addition to the brilliant original one, but it really fails to do so. As it stands, it's not a bad game, but it did not live up to my expectancies at all.Gameplay: 15/30Graphics: 14/20Sound: 8/10Technical: 6/10 (it felt like being slower and less well optimized)Replayability: 6/10 (SP only, but the arcade levels add some extra challenges with leaderbords)Steam integration: 5/10 (no cards, a small bunch of achievements, while the original game really shined here)Personal appreciation: 4/10Overall score: 58/100			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a spin-off/sequel to Alan Wake. A heads-up about the game and this review, Alan Wake's American Nightmare takes place after Alan Wake, and has spoilers for the first game. It really shouldn't be played until after the first game, and as such with this review I am going to be comparing it a lot to the first game, and will drop a few spoilers.Alan Wake's American Nightmare takes place in Arizona, in a fictional town known as Night Springs. However, as we find out early on, Night Springs is not actually a solid place, but rather rather more like an illusion brought to life by the Darkness, and a town that can appear anywhere, just tonight it happens to be in Arizona. When we last saw Alan Wake, he was trapped in the Dark Place, and in American Nightmare he still hasn't quite escaped. Instead, he appears where the darkness goes, and in this case he has written himself into reality as a the hero to an episode of the TV series from the first game, Night Springs. He's done so to combat Mr. Scratch, who's called as such as trying to say his real name comes out like scratching noises. Mr. Scratch is Alan's doppelganger, who was seen briefly towards the end of Alan Wake. He's come into reality since, after Alan's disappearance, rumors of the author who went missing into the night has spread, and these rumors have taken on the form of Mr. Scratch, a psychopathic killer who wears Alan's face.American Nightmare is even more focused on combat than the original game was, but the combat has seen a lot of improvements. It feels much more solid and fast-paced, on-top of the fact the enemy variety this time is much larger and weirder. There are even more guns, and they manage to feel more varied than the original game as well. This is all backed with still impressive lighting effects, and an overall sleeker look to keep up with the more sci-fi tones this game has.However, with the improved combat comes a step-down of a lot of the charm the original game had. There's no full-on exploration sequences this time around, and the atmosphere is not nearly as immersive this time either.Basically, there's a throw-up between improvements and downgrades. For one, the levels are now no longer linear, instead being more hub-like small open-worlds that you can explore, and generally are fun to as well. There are find-able manuscript pages, televisions, and radios like the first game, but they're more spread-out. There are also guns to unlock, and side-areas to explore just to really explore them. This is a welcome change of pace, especially for a much more combat-composed game.On the other hand, the story is not nearly as interesting. Alan Wake spends most of the narrative chasing down Mr. Scratch, and interacting with a few different chicks that Mr. Scratch has managed to swoon. However, the story in AWAN really doesn't go much further than where Alan Wake ended off, and more elaborates on the ending of the first game rather than move past it, and as such really feels more like filler and sort of lacks climax, conclusion, or really any huge developments.However, Mr. Scratch is a very enjoyable villain. He makes more of an impact than the antagonists of the first game, being deliciously psychopathic and charismatic, and dealing in twisted acts with a child-like glee. The televisions you can find with him are definitely one of the highlights of the game.But then, in probably the biggest flaw for the game, and something really stupid, is that in the game's story you go through its three 'hub' stages three times each. The excuse is that Alan Wake is stuck in a time-loop, and time keeps on resetting itself so he has to start from the beginning again until he can break the cycle. What this means for gameplay is that there really are only three levels in the game, and each one is repeated three times. They do change things up, areas not previously available open up and different events happen each visit, but it still is a bizarre design decision.Made even more bizarre by the game's wave-based horde-like mode. This mode is actually a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be, and honestly may be more fun than the game's actual campaign. It's very frantic, tense, with an addicting risk-and-reward system to try and get high-scores in the mode's five different stages. And this is where it gets bizarre, as the 5 stages in this mode are completely different than the stages in the main game, hell some of the stages are actually larger than the main game's stages. On-top of this, you can actually see the Horde-mode stages in the background of the main story, and see the main story's stages in the background of the Horde Mode stages. Why these five other locations weren't added to the game's story to help keep things more varied is completely lost on me.But the game's Horde Mode, known as Arcade Mode, is completely worth taking part in. It's inclusion is surprising, but not nearly as surprising as how well-executed it actually is.For an arcade-like shooter, Alan Wake's American Nightmare is not bad at all for a spin-off. It's fun, fairly tightly made, and has some fun content to delve in. However, it also as a spin-off feels it misses the mark of what people loved about Alan Wake in several ways, and focuses on the elements that were less enjoyable. Given here, they definitely have been improved, but it strikes as an odd decision.If you liked Alan Wake and want more of it, this is and isn't it. In some ways it retains the charms of the original game, but also doesn't quite have everything that made the original game charming. It is more fun strictly gameplay-wise than Alan Wake, but then it is arguable if that actually makes it more enjoyable overall as it misses what made the first game really enjoyable in many ways.Basically, I cut it like this; The new stuff they introduce is well-done and appreciated, such as the open-world levels, Mr. Scratch as an antagonist, and the surprisingly fun Arcade Mode. The game focuses on combat, which was not the first game's strong point, but it pulls it off much better here, with better mechanics and a larger enemy selection. However, elements like down-time exploration moments, much of the atmosphere, and the narrative are mostly missing or much more limited. And the game is plagued by one big problem, repeating levels, which is made bizarre as the Arcade Mode has completely different levels the devs could of used that are even tied-in with the stories' locations.But it's an enjoyable little romp, and an interesting spin-off that does expand more on the world of Alan Wake, while also improving over it in some ways. It isn't quite as good, but is enjoyable in its own way. If you like exploration, the locations are fun with multiple landmarks and sections. The music is still appropriate and moody, with a few-stand-out tracks. The voicing gets hammier, but it works with the sort of hammier tone of the game (being modeled after a parody of Twilight Zone and all).Alan Wake's American Nightmare is not the sequel fans may clamor for, but is an enjoyable arcade spin-off.

												A dramatic shift from the first game, ""American Nightmare"" pushes the franchise more towards the action/shooter genre than the survival/horror of its first iteration. with plentiful reloads and ammo pick-ups, resource management is never a concern, which is fortunate as enemies are never in short supply either. The game still boasts impressive graphics, although the entire adventure is spread across only three maps, which you will frequently revisit. However, rather than feeling repetitive, each time you return to a map there are new challenges and I quickly came to appreciate the lessons I had learned from my last visit. The story is more fantastic and, at least in my opinion, slightly creepier thanks to the addition of new character (and Alan Wake's evil doppleganger) Mr. Scratch. The first game lacked an identifiable personification of evil with whom the player could relate (and hate); Mr Scratch fulfills that need very well. The adventure is fairly short but enjoyable throughout.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a huge fan of Alan Wake, I have to say I found Alan Wake's American Nightmare rather disappointing. What this game does well is the atmosphere, the gameplay, the voice acting, and other minor technical details. What is doesn't do well is the story.The game gives you 9 missions, but it's more like 3; you essentially play 3 missions 3 times each. I won't go into detail, but each time you repeat one of the missions there is different dialogue and slightly modified objectives. You'll see what I mean after you finish the game. I think if the story hadn't been set up do this, it would have been a much better game. The game is actually labeled as a spinoff from the original set in the same universe, and man, ain't that the truth. If you were hoping to get any significant continuation of story from the original out of this game, I'm sorry to tell you, but you won't find it here. I would have been truly upset if this was the sequel.Nevertheless, I still found the game enjoyable for everything it did right. If you are a die-hard Alan Wake fan, I recommend this to you. If you have not played Alan Wake before, I strongly urge you to play the original before playing this. If you played original Alan Wake and it wasn't necessarily your favorite game/you thought it was just alright, you might be better off waiting for the true sequel. Otherwise, this is a great game to pick up on a sale.			",225,23,2,6,6,0,5

												I don't understand why this game is so highly rated. The game is repetitive (you basically have to replay the game 3x as part of the story), and the voice acting and writing are horrible. Seriously, isn't Alan Wake supposed to be a writer? The dialogue in this game is laughably bad. The story is very weak, and doesn't add much to the original. The atmosphere of this game isn't anything like Alan Wake. The original had plenty of moments keeping you on the edge of your seat; this one isn't frightening at all. For how good Alan Wake was, this one is that bad. Save your time and money and do not get this game.			",225,57,12,9,15,3,25

												American Nightmare would have been better entitled 'Deja Vu You', or 'Today is Tomorrows Yesterday' or rename some characters and title it 'Dead Pete Repeated', or even Ground Hog Night, of course without the burrowing rodents who easily frighten at the sight of their own shadows, which in this case, could have worked in the game because these shadows are not factors in how long a season is going to be but how long you live. Luckily, you are armed with the preferred weapon of mall cops everywhere and a shadows worst nightmare, a flashlight. Yes, forcing your will on those weaker than you with a flashlight has never been more enjoyable, except for in Alan Wake's predecessor game and maybe Knights of the Old Republic. The best part of the Alan Wake series is the solid game engine it’s built on. American Nightmare runs so smoothly maxed out on my 7 year old processor and the graphics have improved over the prior installment. Though the other exception to the graphics in this game is that some of the characters are portrayed by live actors in cut scenes. They were not bad but it felt like they could have done more with CGI models rather than the actors being filmed on green screens, using CGI backgrounds. It made for bland effects. The campaign for this sequel seemed like it could have been more of a side mission that would be play throughout different part of the first Alan Wake as you basically play the same 5 levels over and over, with the narrator for The Scary Door helping you relive the nightmare over again. The maps generally stay the same, though some parts of the levels do change slightly but most objects can be found in the same spot every time. For me, I found no replay value in this part of the game once I beat it. To counter for the repetitiously repetitious campaign repetition, they threw in some wave based shooter survival maps they call 'Arcade Mode.' You get a couple different levels and luckily they are outside of the campaign maps. It gives this a little extra value but after finishing those, American Nightmare now sits in my ""completed"" archives in the cloud with Alan Wake.I also found the demented and sick humor included on every tv screen in the game mildly amusing but I quickly lost intrest. They were not as well done, lacked the satire, nor did they have the variety as in the first game.American Nightmare is great third person shooter outside of the small disappointments. If you like third person shooters it's worth checking out, especially enjoyed the first one. Overview Gameplay: Third Person Horror Shooter Graphics: Amazing! Love this engine!Sound: Creepy goodControls: Awesome.Replayability: Little, I got 7 hours out of it. Overall: 8/10 All round it's a great game that reminds me of almost any of M. Knight Shyamalan films... ...it ends with disappointment.			",1077,168,26,30,43,12,27

												Alan Wake: AN is pretty much a standalone DLC for the original game. It explains some of the questions left at the end of the main game and expands a bit on the wholle story, making whorthwhile to people who enjoyed the first game. Everyone else will still be able to sink into a pretty nifty combat system with the use of light at it's core.This game does focuses much more on combat than it's predecessor too, with a few new enemy types and a lot more weapons. Whether or not this is positive, it will depend of the person playing the game.It's also a pretty short experience, the main story breezing throught in just about 4 hours (with the incremented value of running arround looking for collectibles), and there's really no reason to repeat the game... It does however offer an Arcade mode, consisting of a handfull of unlockable levels where you have to survive for 10 minutes. There's a total of 10 of these (5 being ""original"" and the 5 other's being just harder versions of the same maps).Overall, a very enjoyable experience that offers a good atmosphere and combat with the powerfull writing Remedy has gotten us used to. Although many people won't find it worth the full price of 10€, don't think twice about buying it on a sale.			",404,76,10,52,40,5,40

												The original 'Alan Wake' game was one of the most unique single-player experiences I ever had. The story was compelling, the characters were original, and the gameplay was quite inventive. If you're looking for these things in 'American Nightmare', I say: look elsewhere, or simply replay 'Alan Wake'. In this sequel, you follow Alan through a series of dreamlike sequences, and fans of the Jake Gyllenhaal films 'Donnie Darko' or 'Enemy' will be familiar with the ground covered in this game. Unsurprisingly, repeating and attempting to rewrite reality isn't quite as fun in videogame form, and so 'American Nightmare' very quickly degenerates into several hours of mindless repetition. The handful of characters accompanying Alan Wake in this game are incredibly uninteresting, and so the dialogue scenes really aren't worth sitting through. The developers seem to attempt livening the game up with a number of additions in the weapon and enemy departments, but these, again, aren't anything special. I'd only recommend this to: (a) people who've replayed 'Alan Wake' dozens of times, and are lifelong devotees of the character, and (b) people who spot this game massively reduced (i.e. £1 or less).

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare - после событий с первой части прошло целых два года и Алану так и не удалось выбраться из Тёмной Обители. Теперь он попадает в город «Найт Спрингс» и ему вновь предстоит сразить армию злых дядек с топорами, ножами и пилами, но к этому всему добавляются ужасные пауки, которые несмотря ни на что, даже на свет, напрыгивают на вас. Но на этот раз у него будет арсенал лучше! Добавили много разных огнестрельных стволов, с которыми стало гораздо проще уничтожать своих противников. Конечно же здесь есть свой сюжет, но он очень короткий, но игрушка может похвастаться аркадным режимом, где вам нужно выстоять против кучки врагов до рассвета за определенное время. А так же в каждой видюшке можно услышать хорошую музыку, которая вам должна обязательно понравиться. Рекомендую брать игрушку по скидке, так как уж больно короткая, но лично меня она заинтересовала.			",1003,255,35,79,72,10,109

												Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is based on a script written by Alan Wake for the TV series Night Springs, the TV show mentioned in the first game. Alan finds himself in Night Springs, a town in Arizona.Here Alan meets people who claim to have already met him, yet these same people admit that he is not the man they previously met. It seems Alan has a doppelganger, his dark half, a man who represents all his bad sides and is referred to as Mr Scratch. Mr Scratch is not a friendly guy, he is a murder and he wants to take over Alan’s life.  So you must stop him.  That is basically the whole story. The story is also really short, it will only take around 5 hours to finish the game.The game itself is much more action orientated than the original, yet there seems to be fewer enemies encounters than that game had.Overall the sound design is good and if you enjoyed it in the first game you will enjoy it here.The game’s cut scenes are interesting, because a real actor portray both, Alan himself and Mr Scratch.The graphics are not bad, there has been a definite improvement to the engine since the original Alan Wake.Besides of the Story mode there is also the Arcade Mode. It is a survival mode where wave after wave of enemies are sent for you until the timer runs out and the sun rises. There are 5 different maps, each repeated with a nightmare mode version and are all unlocked by gaining stars for the previous levels completed.All in all, Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is a not a bad game. Overall it is an enjoyable game but disappointing compared to the orginal Alan Wake.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

ALAN WAKE'S AMERICAN NIGHTMAREA disappointing stand alone spin off to the superior original Alan WakeRating 4/10In comparison to Alan Wake the semi-follow up/spin-off Alan Wake's American Nightmare is completely different in tone verging on parody and at times full blown comedy. Sadly it doesn't work well. The main problem being the limited setting, gone is superbly realised setting of Bright Falls from the original and in it’s place is the desert town of Night Springs. There are only three small sections to explore and you're forced to replay through each section three times as the story repeats itself, it's a cheap trick at extending the running time. To compound this the settings aren't that interesting, sure they look pretty but by removing Alan Wake from the cold and dark forest setting from the original it loses something. The supporting cast don't help as well, three new characters, one in each location, they are badly voiced acted and don't fit in with the Alan Wake universe. Finally the last disappointment comes in the shape of the main antagonist, Mr Scratch. Alluded to in the original he makes his appearance and then proceeds to do very little.There are a few positives to the single player campaign. It's short enough so it doesn't over stay it's welcome and it's nice to hear the updates on characters from the original game through the use of the radios and televisions. They've also improved the controls and animations so the fighting and general movement isn't as clunky as before and they've added an array of new enemies to fight, some of these are nice additions.The second part to American Nightmare is the new action mode, eight or so maps where you have to hold off waves of enemies for ten minutes or so until it is dawn. It's a survivor gametype and it plays quite nicely, however it doesn't really belong in the Alan Wake universe which was rich on story and setting. It feels tacked on and as though it belongs to another game. So if you have the original Alan Wake and enjoyed it there isn't much to recommend here and if you haven't played the original Alan Wake avoid this follow up at all costs and play  the far superior original.

												This is a pretty big departure from the original Alan Wake, but i don't really see the hate towards this that some people have. If you approach this like this should be approached, by considering this a shooter you will have fun. Gone are the good storyline (although there are some fun bits in this one), suspense, atmosphere and detailed locations of the original, this is a shooting fest for few hours set in the same world, and expanding the lore/plot of the original.The combat itself is fluid, they seemed to concentrate on that mostly, which is understandable, but still the levels feel very empty. They're small and not crafted with the same passion that we had before. Basically they're just there to house some dudes in for you to shoot. The timeloop aspect of the plot, gives us some funny moments and pieces of dialoque, but it also makes running the levels a bit tedious.Manuscript pages are back, and this time they're used to unlock weapons :D I don't know is that a good thing or not when thinking about how important part they were in on the last game, where we didn't really have much combat at all, but at least it's somehow funny when you look at it. And guns are plenty, but the bad guys come in shamefully low numbers for us who have accustomed to shooters. Game does offer arcade mode also so we aren't limited only to the campaign, but it's 10 minutes per level. If you want to shoot hordes of Taken, better be fast!This is fun for a few hours, but this goes in the same category as Elder scrolls online vs Skyrim. People marched into ESO thinking it's the new skyrim because it had the same name. Yes, you play as Alan here, but he's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he's had enough of this darkness nonsense, and he has the firepower to back his frustration!			",397,158,8,45,43,3,41

												Can't say much good about this DLC. First off the story has you revisit the same places three times over. I don't care how good your story is (it's not), that just reeks of laziness. And then there is the fact the DLC is laughabily easy and not at all scary compared to the main game. Sorely disappointed. Pick it up cheap if you want to play everything in the franchise, but otherwise I'd not spend money on it.			",91,63,0,29,12,0,11

												1-sentence review : a nice side view on the Alan Wake's universe, it doesn't bring anything essential, but the (short) ride is enjoyable.Pros:- gameplay wise, it still works well- atmosphere is well done, although not great like the one from the original Alan Wake- arcade mode is well done and if you're into it you should spend a couple of hours to beat the normal levelsCons:- story doesn't make much sense if you look it from too close- it's not Alan Wake 2 (not really a con, but it's important to be aware of that, else the game will be a big disappointment)- it made me feel it'll be hard to do an actual interesting Alan Wake 2 with the state that we were left at end of the n°1 ... :-(- a bit short on story time (about 5 or 6 hours without rushing) & story content			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have just ended this game, & I am still impressed with the engine and still love the protagonist as much.For various reasons I preferred the first in the series by far.-The setting was more cozy to say it quickly. -The story very engaging. In this installment automatic weapons are introduced, which is a nice break-letting the lead fly. The forest [AW1] is something I appreciated rather than a heated ""Texas"" diner in the desert [American Nightmare] (Where I reside it's QUITE hot, letting my imagination roam was enjoyable).I recommend the game;-It is my favourite genre; 3rd person shooter. -I compare it favourably with Alan Wake 1, I just prefer 1.-It is HD (high definition), I played it on my Vista. -Compatible on most systems.If you like you may look at my review for AW1, it was the first review I ever wrote, ""glowingly"" and ""praising"" the game. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991756666/recommended/108710. I feel like re-playing Alan Wake 1 right now, that's a reflection of the positive effect this game had on me :-)Game on			",906,268,12,52,34,7,57

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is an adventure third-person shooter game. It is a sequel to the previous game Alan Wake.The gameplay is pretty much the same as Alan Wake, but is more action oriented rather than a survival horror game, you have to fight a ghost like enemy that protected with darkness aura. You neutralize the aura first with your handheld flashlight before you can completely kill the enemy. There are many new weapons in this game like semi-automatic rifle, SMG and assault rifle. Also there is a new arcade game mode where you have to survive the night until dawn and kill as many enemy as you can to get higher score. The storyline is not as much as Alan Wake but still enjoyable and good. If you have finished Alan Wake, in the end level you meet Mr. Scratch. He is the new enemy in this game.Alan Wake's American Nightmare graphics has been improved since the previous game. The shader looks quite better and the physics effects too. Environment are not so scary as the previous Alan Wake.Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a good sequel and a good game. I recommend this.Rating 7/10			",1158,351,58,143,167,12,228

												The combat has been vastly improved over vanilla Alan Wake and now is genuinely fun. It's just a shame that the game is so short and the plot not very indepth because the combat is good now. Despite the lack of indepth plot, It still has solid atmopshere and writing like its predecessor. Definitely pick this up along with the original.			",218,242,2,31,19,2,23

												Alan Wake American Nightmare ist NICHT Alan Wake 2, soviel im Voraus. Trotzdem greift er Gameplay und Athmosphäre vom ersten Teil auf. Obwohl ich sehr viel Spaß damit hatte und ich mehr Stunden als nötig darin versenkt habe, kommt es doch nicht ganz an die Klasse von Alan Wake 1 heran. So ist die Kampagne sehr viel kürzer und auch die Story hätte mehr Klasse zeigen können. Dennoch ein Daumen nach oben, da das Spiel im Gesamten seinen Preis wert war.

I finished Alan Wake before playing American Nightmare.Technical wise...Graphic slightly improved from the original Alan Wake.The Font used is straighter. Easier and Nicer to read.HUD is changed to a solid one as well : rectangle life bar with 3 seperation, one rectangle battery bar.Likes+ Combat. Same as the original Alan Wake, except more guns!+ Conversation between characters. I don't feel ""Tarantino"" as the Wiki page suggested, though it can be humourous or hilarious.+ Semi-open world design. Invisible wall but only when you run too far away from the design level. Free running.+ Soundtrack. I just like it lol.Dislikes- Story. It is short and complex but easy to understand. I mentioned in my Alan Wake review that the story is good but poorly presented. In American Nightmare, it is otherwise, well presented but a poor storyline.- Game Length. Too short. Even if you explore the whole world, it should take no more than 5 hours. Speedrun may be done in 15 minutes.- Gameplay Design. Not as creative as the original Alan Wake.Check out my Alan Wake review :http://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/108710 ",348,90,6,27,18,3,33

												Loved Alan Wake (the original).This very short sequel, however, just doesn't have enough content (to warrant three passes through the same areas), it is short and the writing is not as good as in the original.I really want to see a fully fleshed out AW2, but this quick run-around is not up to the same standards set by the original.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare has the same mechanics as the previous Alan Wake title, but almost everything else has changed for this one. (The game takes place in an episode of Night Springs written by Alan Wake)First of all, the game is way easier and provides you ammo refills every 100m so you never really need to conserve ammo, except maybe at the end of the game. The spooky aspect is gone all together, making the game more action oriented, with ALOT of combat. The game is basically the same campaign 3 times (because you're in a time loop) but it manages to mix it up somewhat, even though it gets repetitive. The dialogue is less appealing than in the original and sometimes the character models of the NPC's you meet are really ugly. Lastly, the flashlight is now godly: it recharges almost instantly and you barely ever have to pop in other batteries.In conclusion, I would recommend this game if you really want to play everything from the Alan Wake series. The game stands fine on it's own, but with the weight of the first one, American Nightmare delivered something completely different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I would say it's a good game, but not a very good Alan Wake game.			",260,60,6,27,17,1,12

												Great game! Yes, it's short but this game is not only about the story mode, which is good with a nicer visual, gameplay and UI than it's previous game and it features great soundtrack as usual with previous games from Remedy but it also got an Arcade Action where you have to reach a certain amount of star/points to unlock the next stage. It's fun and has leadersboards etc. You can get around 4/5 with the story mode including collecting all 53 pages and a buch more with the Arcade Action.Not as great as the original Alan Wake, this game is good for it's price.Score: 7/10.

												Although American Nightmare is a nice way to wrap up the ending of Alan Wake it falls very short in terms of storytelling and gameplay. There is more of an arcade type feel about this one and the ""Groundhog Day"" mechanic, where the player must repeat the same levels multiple times, soon becomes very tiring despite the game's short length. There seems to be a competition between the voice acting and scripted dialogue, battling for the ""Most Awful Delivery"" award, but I'd say it was a tie.It's a shame, I really enjoyed Alan Wake. I'm quite partial to small-town mysteries (Life is Strange, Twin Peaks, Deadly Premonition, Stranger Things) but American Nightmare took such a divergent path from its predecessor that it never really elicited a spark like the original did.That doesn't make it a bad or unenjoyable experience... just an underwhelming one but it's still worth playing.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare (a.k.a. AWAN) is a great expansion to Alan Wake. Introducing new weapons, new enemies, a new location, and an extensive arcade mode. The dense forests in Alan Wake has been replaced by big open spaces in AWAN, giving you more freedom to wander around. Introducing automatic weapons like the Submachine Gun, Combat Shotgun, and Nailgun is also a fun change.When you finish AWAN you'll still have lots of hours of fun in the arcade mode. A good feature for those who can't get enough of Alan Wake, like me ;)I do recommend finishing Alan Wake first before starting AWAN. By doing this you'll have a better understanding of what he's been through.I give AWAN a 9 instead of a 10 because I would have liked some gameplay features to be kept the same as in Alan Wake, but still overall it's a pretty good expansion to Alan Wake.9/10			",58,19,0,3,4,0,6

												Действие игры происходит в Аризоне, куда Алан Вейк прибыл в образе этакого ""борца"" света против тьмы. В аддоне появились нововведения, как значительные, так и не очень. Графика стала хуже, хотя пустынный сеттинг, очень даже неплох. Игра почти полностью перешла на «шутерную» механику, потеряв свою хоррорность и атмосферность. Если раньше нужно было экономить каждый патрон, оружие попадалось редко, то теперь оружия стало больше, а патроны можно пополнить в ближайшем «наполнителе». Сюжет имеет смысл, но в тоже время-это «чистая халтура».P.S: В общем, от  Alan Wake's American Nightmare, остаются как и неплохие впечатления, так и не очень!Оценка: неплохо 6/10 ",118,9,8,7,4,2,8

Alan Wake's American Nightmare			* 6/10Alan Wake's American Nightmare takes place after the events of the original Game and DLCs. Now Alan must confront himself with the Psychotic Mr Scratch, which is trying to bring the darkness out and spread it in the world... Between a murder and a torture.The premise is solid and the gameplay seems improved, but this is all a mask on a product which seems made with short time, minor inspiration and different purposes. This leads to a ""sequel"" which is not a sequel (remedy stated this is more like a spinoff), with a lack of atmosphere as in the original title, underdeveloped valid ideas and a gameplay improved and ruined at the same time.The atmosphere and the gameplay are two elements really close as even though the story takes place always by night in unpopulated areas, with bad or no illumination the locations are not... interesting. They have nothing to do with the charm of Bright Falls, the landscapes, the detailed ambiences. Of course few places or elements are very interesting and detailed, but in its entirety it doesn't even compare with Alan Wake.The Gameplay doesn't help much. They Have added more weapons unlockable with collectible manuscripts, but the worst part is the Ammo Box... A self regenerating ammo box. This seems like the same evolution that affected the Resident Evil Saga, so you had to survive with few bullets and a bunch of weapons with a character that can barely run, and now Alan Wake can Magically Run three times longer before spitting a lung, he can easily get his hands on an arsenal and the game almost throws ammo box at him... Nope. Even though I'm quite glad Alan Can Run longer (It was really frustrating in the Original Game), and I'm glad they've replaced the six-shoots revolver with an automatic gun... I mean, seriously? A gun with six bullets to be reloaded one by one? Come on... (Don't misunderstand me, I understand it was meant to give the game a Survival gameplay, it's just me hating that kind of guns...).And once again For both the atmosphere and the gameplay, you will visit three relatively small locations for three times... And every time it will take you less to complete each locations. It took me 4 hours and I was even looking for collectibles...There's also an arcade mode which is nothing more than an arena with hordes of takensattacking you. I don't even know why I'm bothering to mention it...The only positive note is the idea behind the game and the character of Mr Scratch. Just look at the TVs you can find around the locations, you'll see his ""messages"" for Alan. Not to mention the Trailers With Mr Scratch, Ilkka Villi has done a really great interpretation. Too bad the character wasn't developed further than what you see in those videos, which is a serious waste...The other and last positive note in the game is the music... Nevermind, I eat it back, because it features a new track from the ""old Gods of Asgard"", from Poets of The Fall (Actually the same Guys XD) and another track, ""Club Foot"" from Kasabian... And Even though I adore them that's everything good the soundtrack has to offer, which for me is not enough. There's no ominous music, the good tracks are wasted in Climaxing Action scenes which actually lasted 10 seconds on top and there's no credit song worth listening as in the Original Title.What can I say, Alan Wake's American Nightmare isn't a very bad game, it had some good potential but some gameplay choices altered the spirit of the Original Alan Wake and the game itself looks rushed without any detailed developing in locations, characters or story. So all in all it's not a bad game actually, but a sequel/spinoff, call it whatever you want, which unfortunately doesn't really compare to the Original Alan Wake, and really this is a pity as I really loved it.+++PROs+++ MR SCRATCH. I don't know how to put it. Ilkka Villi Simply did an awesome interpretation of Alan Wake's psychotic doppelganger. Simply awesome. MUSIC. Kasabian's track really fits into the mood of the events and poets of the fall gave a couple of other great tracks.---CONs--- REPETITIVENESS. The game takes place in three locations which you will visit for three times, doing almost the same things. It has a reason for that but it really affects the gameplay as it makes things easier and more predictable. GAMEPLAY. I'm almost sure they planned improvements as increased stamina, more weapons and excessive amount of ammos to give more fun and action to the game, which to me resulted in a more boring gameplay with almost every survival element almost disappeared. SHORT. There is not enough of anything: the game itself lasts 4 hours at best. The awesome interpretation of a stronger villain such as Mr Scratch is simply confined in cutscenes or in the videos seen in the TVs around the maps. The Soundtrack is made of just three tracks and even though they're awesome they're still just three songs. There are not enough bullets... No wait, there actually are all the bullets you want...

It is worth to play once, but that's it.Oh and listen to the soundtrack: Old Gods Of Asgard - Balance Slays The DemonThank me later!			",282,54,8,37,30,6,49

												Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is the unofficial sequel to the original Alan Wake. As a fan of the original game, I would highly recommend playing this one after you’ve gone through the original. While it can be played as a standalone, there are many references to characters and stories from the original that help to enrich the story throughout the game.No longer is Alan Wake in the beautiful rustic backdrop of the pacific northwest, this time he finds himself in the arid deserts of Arizona. With a new western theme, the game remains true to itself by using the same fighting techniques and graphic qualities as the first game, but with slight tweaks and updates that breathe a new life into the game. Collecting manuscripts to unlock weapons, more dialogue options for NPCs, and containers that give max ammo/batteries, for example.Like the first game, this game has many interesting cut scenes that really add to the story, and the use of real actors is a nice touch as well. Television recordings and radio broadcasts help create a backdrop for the other characters in Alan’s old life, telling their current stories alongside his own.There is also an Arcade Mode for those who wish to challenge themselves, or for those who just want to bash in some taken skulls.For a short(er) game, I found the story to be intriguing and unique.  However, as I progressed further into the game I felt like the gameplay got a little repetitive and the enemies became more annoying than challenging. The fact that there are only three locations to explore, and that you return to them repeatedly, was disappointing. I was expecting more unique and exciting locations much like the original had offered. My overall score for the game: 7/10. Recommended for any fans of the series or anyone looking for a short supernatural shooter with both mystery and intrigue. ",79,36,0,24,8,0,1

												I find works of Alfred Hitchcock, Stephen King and David Lynch pretty interesting. When Remedy Entertainment released info about Alan Wake, it sounded like a jackpot. Let’s be honest, not only because those people were making part action, part survival horror game greatly influenced by King’s work, but you know what else they’ve developed? Max Payne. Yup, that’s right. One of the best, if not the best single player experience of all times. I could play it over and over again. Don’t need no multiplayer, no sandbox or multi choices world. Just a bottle of painkillers and Max’s rage to the max.Alan Wake was a good game. It had its set of flaws: it was a bit too long, a bit too hard at certain points and a bit too boring by the end, but it was an honest homage to one of the greatest living authors. Its story line, characters, ideas and moody atmosphere haunted players long after they were done with the game. Basically — it was Twin Peaks digested by Stephen King. Add some nasty black birds for Hitchcock’s own personal enjoyment.Alan Wake’s American Nightmare (AWAN from now on) is not a sequel, but a different game with similar mechanics (use a light source to weaken your opponent, use your shotgun to blow his brains out) . It doesn’t spoil the fun of playing the first AW game, but it surely provides enough references so you should probably play this one after you're done with the original game. Don’t listen to Remedy Entertainment when they say it’s a great starting point for a new players right there on AWAN Steam page because it isn’t.Unlike Alan Wake, AWAN is more action and adrenaline oriented game, with less storytelling, less characters and less plot twists (if any). Alan went from mentally scarred writer suffering from writer’s block to gun wielding one liner super hero. Usually, I don’t like these kind of changes, but the whole game is reskinned, settings and atmosphere are changed, and it blurs the reality and fiction in a strange way, so at the end you might ask yourself: is Alan dreaming? Is this real? Maybe, just maybe you are playing Alan’s scenario for a Twilight Zone’s inspired show The Night Springs?It took me approximately four hours to finish the game, I’ve collected almost 3/4 of manuscript pages, so if you’re into collecting you’ll probably need some more time to find all the weapons, radio and TV shows. Game also has some pretty good cutscenes that pop up from time to time and main antagonist Mr. Scratch — Wake’s doppelganger, is sooooo ridiculous, but it fits the whole Arizona setting nicely.After you’re done with Story Mode, you can try your luck and skills at Arcade — in Arcade mode your objective is to survive until dawn (read: sunrise). Can you make it? Do it in style, don’t let ‘em touch you, collect points, guns and skulls of your enemies so you can place your♥♥♥♥♥on leaderboards and see how you compare to your friends. It’s a fun mode, but believe me, only for a few rounds — unless you have fanatical friends who love playing it all over and over again. I don’t.The best way to think about Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is this: if original Alan Wake title was a Stephen King’s book, then Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is Stephen King’s movie. You know how they usually chop down his movies, twist ‘em around, skin ‘em alive and dumbify them as much as possible? Yes, Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is King’s version of “The Shining”, “The Night Flier” or “The Thinner”, but you just LOVE those cheap shots at silver screen glory. If you’re coming from Alan Wake and you’re expecting the same kind of rich storytelling — don’t, because you don’t need to end up disappointed. Leave this short game for one boring weekend and get ready to shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot. Wait. Reload. Shoot again. OK, they’re all gone.***Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it?

												I played this and the original Alan Wake. In this one I only played the story mode. The graphics are beautiful, it's easier than the previous one. The story here is quite nice. I wasn't on the edge like the previous one. Maybe because I got used to the setting. But please don't think you'll make 100 hours playing it. I finished it in one day (6 hours). This game and the original one are definitely worth playing if you grab it on an offer.			",85,22,2,6,4,0,12

												While Alan Wake's strongpoint was it's narrative and storytelling, American Nightmare seemed to think it was the gameplay. Because of that, Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a definite step back from the original, and unless you really liked the combat of Alan Wake, to the extent you'd play a mediocre game just to have a more refined version of said combat, then don't bother with Alan Wake's American Nightmare. The game take place at an indeterminate time after Alan's been stuck in Cauldron Lake, he escapes by rewriting reality, and he ends up in Night Springs. It turns out Alan is some ""Champion of Light"", trying to defeat the ""Herald of Darkness""... who the hell wrote this♥♥♥♥♥♥ This isn't Alan Wake, it's some weird pseudo-fantasy cliched bullcrap. Anyway, he's looking for his doppleganger, Mr Scratch, who is the Herald of Darkness, and seeks to destroy him. Along they way he meets secondary characters who seems to completely oblivious to everything that's happening, and just sorta wait for♥♥♥♥♥♥to go wrong. Eventually they do, and Alan goes to a new version of reality where he didn't ♥♥♥♥ up. Rinse and repeat a few times until Fin. The story is uninteresting and unnessarily padded, with the same sequence of events happening 3 times over. The villain is just a♥♥♥♥♥♥version of Alan Wake. He's not even like some evil destroyer of worlds, or some Orange/Blue Morality Nethergod or something; he's just slightly more dickish Alan Wake.Aside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot, combat in the game has been changed a bit. It features more weapons and noticebly faster than in the original game. While the combat is more enjoyable, it still doesn't make up for the bad narrative.If you liked Alan Wake (at least for the reasons I did), then skip this one, it's not worth your time or your money.

												TL;DR: The familiar flashlight-shooter horror game makes a comeback but demoted to an action shooter. Alan Wake is back. This time around he's seasoned and armed to the teeth, steeled by the Dark Place he has been trapped since last time. Consequently, American Nightmare builds heavily on the original game's story. If you haven't played it expect to be confused by what's going on. In fact I'd recommend one to play (link!) Alan Wake before American Nightmare to be able to understand the story, if only because of the nice references.Having played the original game ensures that you will fully understand the story. Alan Wake is very literally the superhero of his own story, somehow constantly knowing what to do when the player is left perplexed by all the peculiar events. In the story Alan is trapped in the Dark Place and wants to escape. He has a plan that is revealed bit by bit.The ominous Mr. Scratch, introduced briefly in Alan Wake, has become the villain, a malicious manifestation of The Dark Presence. He will appear from time to time in random TV screens to taunt Alan. None of the rest of the characters make come-backs (well, unless you count the radio show host). In fact, there are only three other characters to interact with. Their acting feels too cheesy and out-of-place, and it's weird anyway that there are so few people around.The play area is also lot smaller than in Alan Wake: only three (albeit rather big) maps contain the whole story in nine chapters that slyly recycle the same areas. While it makes sense for the story, it makes one think that it was done so because of low budget.The radio shows and Alan's notes are still there and they are cool and I felt they were approximately of the same quality as in Alan Wake. Graphics and sound are similar quality to the original.Alan's confidence actually eats the atmosphere: the ominous mood of the original Alan Wake is almost completely missing. The Taken appear out of no-where but there's nothing building up tension, and usually they are easy to dispatch because there's ammo and supplies basically everywhere.American Nightmare is then sort of an action version of Alan Wake: the Taken (i.e. the enemies) are more aggressive and numerous, and there are several new weapons from crossbows to automatic shotguns. A few more enemy types have been introduced, some of which need to be dispatched without light. They are all fine additions to the enemy roster.To the joy of the lovers of the curious combat system an Arcade mode has been included. In the Arcade mode you have to survive 10 minutes of Taken waves of increasing strength. You build up a combo multiplier by successful kills and not getting hit and try to reach as high a score as possible. For a change, it gets fairly difficult and it's easy to run out of ammo. Your skills will be tested especially in the Nightmare mode, in which there are no longer separate waves or pauses: instead the Taken appear continuously making the action very intense.Much shorter than Alan Wake, the story lasts just a few hours and I managed to even get all the achievements without guides in 10 and 1/2 hours. The story has practically no replay value unless you missed some of the notes (in which case you can choose to replay individual chapters). Arcade mode has some interesting challenge achievements and there you can fight for the highest place on the global leaderboards if that's your thing.I think American Nightmare is an okay sequel but it pales in comparison with the original. Get it if you liked Alan Wake but wait for a sale.			",3011,1260,77,374,381,26,452

												If you liked Alan Wake you may or may not like American Nightmare. The game was okay, had an intresting plot, tons more weapons, spiders, taken that look even worse than in Alan Wake etc. American Nightmare unlike the first game is not a survival horror game, its more an action based game. The plot takes place in the popular tv show ""Night Springs"" in an epsode written by Alan himself were the champion of light (Alan) must defeat the herald of darkness (His Evil Twin Mr Scratch). The game takes place in three places: The Motel/Rest Stop, The Observatory and The Drive-in Theater and upon reaching the end of the Drive-in Theater Mr Scratch sends Alan back to the start meaning you have to play through the game again with small differences, this happens twice, in other words, there are Three Areas and Three time loops. The third loop adds the giant, long story short they're scary. In my opinion the game was mostly good but I didn't like the weapon unlock system because they required pages which I sucked at finding. I also didn't like where the game was set and I would take Bright Falls over this. Also spiders.			",106,16,0,5,10,3,2

												By rights, Alan Wake's American Nightmare should be utterly underwhelming. The core game is changed not at all from its parent's lukewarm style, the story is thin and hackneyed, hell it even has live-action cutscenes. But somehow, the gameplay is challenging enough to keep you clicking that left mouse button and listening to that weird, not quite Rod Serling voice telling you to survive until morning just one more time. Even tho this game has a few cons, I can say if you have some spare money buy this game and you will have some moments of fun but not so much fun after playing a bit more after the story. And no the game is not very scary!			",81,5,3,3,10,0,0

												Great game! 9/10I bought this game on sale for $2.99 and didn't expect much. I played the first game and loved it so I couldn't pass this one up. I am so glad I didn't pass it up, it is worth buying even if it is not on sale!While this game is not nearly as long as the original, the story will draw you in. I had a hard time putting the game down once I began playing the story mode. It is similiar to the originial in that there are manuscripts to collect, radio shows to listen to and also T.V. recordings to watch. You will also see some familiar characters.The combat system is so very fluid! The combat in this game is addicting in itself and outside of the story there is plenty of arcade levels to enjoy the combat! The mechanics are nearly the same as the original but there are tons of weapons to find and unlock in this game! There are also several new enemies that were not in the original, each which requires a different tactic to take down effectively. And that brings me to my last highlight of the game..Mr. Scratch! After seeing him in this game he is now my favorite villain of all time. He is so different from anything else I have seen in a game and he is definitely the biggest highlight of the game. The actor that plays him(and Alan Wake himself) is phenomenal!! I can not wait for another sequel!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not bad, RemedyAlright, so this review might be a little biased due to the fact that I loved Alan Wake and am currently foaming at the mouth because of the new emergence of details on there possible being an Alan Wake 2 in development very soon. However, I'll try to keep it fair.If you have never played Alan Wake, you will most likely quit this game after 5 minutes, then come back and fall in love with it. That's what happened to me with the first Alan Wake game. However, there are some notable differences between American Nightmare and the first Alan Wake. For instance, you will never struggle to find ammo or batteries for your flashlight in this game. And if you do, you're doing it wrong. Remedy set out to make this short semi-sequel of Alan Wake with more of an arcade feeling than the previous game. Also, the entire campaign takes place in an episode of an in-game fictional TV show called Night Springs, which is playing on a TV in a hotel room that Alan's friend Barry is asleep in. This is unlike Alan Wake because Alan Wake had 5 ""episodes"" of gameplay if I remember correctly. Also, there was no true narrator in Alan Wake. There is in this game, and the narrator even gives Alan a cool nickname: The Champion of Light. And Alan's alternate, dark personality, Mr. Scratch, is coined as the Herald of Darkness. Basically, the entire goal of the campaign is to stop Mr. Scratch from turning the world into the dark place he wants it to be. His ultimate goal is to stop the sun from ever rising again. As the champion of light, you set out on a mission against the dark side of yourself to ensure that the sun indeed does rise and the world can be restored to its natural self.Moving on to gameplayThe gameplay mimics the exact same style of action as the first Alan Wake. You are Alan, a horror-crime genre writer, armed with a flashlight, and any guns, flares, and flashbang grenades you can find. When you encounter a Taken individual (the poor souls taken by the darkness of Mr. Scratch), you have to rid them of the darkness before you can deal any true damage to them. This is done by focusing your flashlight on them, throwing a flash grenade at them, or putting a flare down/waiting for the unfocused ray of your flashlight to break the darkness. The game is filled with many jumpscares, much like the original Alan Wake. You may find yourself looking over your own shoudler in real life after you turn around and there's a lumberjack with a sickle stalking you from two feet behind. When in doubt, throw whatever throwable item you have equipped; it will solve a lot of problems in your life. The plot twists within the story are also very interesting. I won't spoil anything of course, but let's just say you'll find yourself in the same place more than once.I absolutely recommend this game to everyone, but especially to people who have played Alan Wake or just want to try something different from the meta of the modern video game industry. This game features a lot of the concepts that were supposed to be/will be in Alan Wake 2 (incase anyone other than me is excited about that). I give it a 9/10, but only because it honestly is not challenging if you have played the original Alan Wake. I might have died 2-3 times in 7 hours of gameplay with completion of the story. You should also check out the arcade game mode if you actually enjoy the different combat style that this game features, like me. Buy it and play it. But don't be surprised if you beat the story in 5 hours.9/10 starsUnique combat styleTV show simulation settingPlot twist after plot twistJUMP SCARES!Get it ",87,4,0,11,6,0,2

												alan wake’s american nightmare clasps all of alan wake’s mechanical flaws and obliterates them. controls are tighter, with dodge timing being newly snappy and forgiving. it’s appreciated, because enemies appear in blind spots more frequently. guns look and feel much more satisfying to fire and sound incredible this time around. flares still encourage a defensive anti-shooter playstyle, however they do not last nearly as long and aren’t given out in absurd quantities. flashbangs have their power lowered so they no longer overlap with the flare gun without obvious gain and loss. gun power and balance felt the same, however, gone are half-baked efforts at attempting to be a survival game. you can use whatever guns you want when you want, which is what ended up happening in alan wake anyway. the survival horror pretense is thankfully dropped. alan wake was a stylized third person shooter at its core, so it’s great to see it fully embraced in american nightmare. the best improvements are the eradication of needing batteries for your flashlight - it recharges at a lightning rate on its own - and the ability to reload while shining down the darkness, even if that action is physically impossible (if that was in alan wake to begin with eat me for having human memory). battery consumables are still in the game for convenience if you want to double your shining time, thankfully not tedious extensions requried for large enemies.alan wake’s critical flaw was its length and its inability to justify it. stuffed packed full of filler and repeated enemy encounters. it tested your endurance and your love for debonair writers. american nightmare injects prior simple enemy types with a great sense of purpose and character design. as a result of its short length, it has a rapid-fire pace of introducing entirely new enemy types. american nightmare is a third of the length of alan wake and actually has more enemy types than the original game. though the same approach went into designing the encounters, it goes without saying that their self-awareness paid off immensely. it lacks any strategic depth beyond: here’s a mob of ten enemies, blow them up somehow. the first game regrettably was the same way. a third person shooter without cover, with action mechanics, and with depth and finesse, is that too much to ask for? yeah, it’s too much to ask for. I really do like the utter improvements to flashing and shooting american nightmare brought out, that’s everything I want and need from a sequel, and it’s extremely fun to play. these are great things to say about game, so keep that to heart, when I say that’s largely where the compliments stop.alan wake was not carefully written. it’s endearing in its transparent absurdity. you know this so-called famous writer has printed lines as good as a high schooler in creative writing and it’s ok because he’s a facsimile, he’s a failed writer, he’s the embodiment of a writer - but maybe he’s not actually good at it. those are excuses and I’m totally sure not intentions, however, they work real nicely justifying the original alan wake. american nightmare is one-third the length of alan wake and tries to be just as high concept, it tries to conclude every loose end left open prior, and it takes its writing just as seriously. it doesn’t work, there’s no way it could work, and there’s nothing admirable about it trying so desperately. no, remedy was wrong to begin with. considering the parameters of a much smaller game, concessions have to made. when you transplant a large structure into the smaller product resulting of the concessions, you nullify the concessions completely, and create something that can only be inferior. embracing a new direction is how you subsist on a new field. if the container is smaller, it can’t be filled with the same amount of liquid.what grinds me is that every theme covered in american nightmare is identical to the themes in alan wake. it doesn’t consider the consequences, besides one exchange with the scientist lady, nor does it expand on obvious horizons. it puerilely restates everything explored in alan wake with one difference: alan wake has adopted a kind of god or hero complex. I guess he has to, the way the narrative is phrased around a champion of light and a herald of darkness, and it doesn’t really contradict alan wake’s character progression. what it does though is invalidate all of its themes; doubt, darkness, and mystery have no room to breathe in front of a main character who just shrugs his shoulders and cleans it all up. in the length allotted to american nightmare, it’s impossible to explore the duality, the clash of light and darkness, the external phenomenon of a previously internal conflict. what personal ugliness alan wake struggled against in the original game falls flat in its face with alan wake overcoming all of it and the game insisting it’s still there.american nightmare takes place in arizona, instead of washington. the lush and beautiful forested levels are replaced with arid fields. the three levels are big and open, but they’re empty. encounters only and predictably happen when you approach objectives. they’re exclusively disorganized swarms. every objective is dumb and arbitrary and never does let you just clear checkpoints; clear a level. granted, it doesn't have to operate that way, but if all you can construct is swarms of enemies, then an orthodox approach would have been a better fit. there’s still an attention to detail and craftsmanship in the level design, so while they aren’t conventionally beautiful, I still think they’re good levels. it doesn’t excuse what I’ve made an effort not to mention until now. alan wake is stuck in a time loop. what does that mean? it means the ultimate filler. it means playing the same three levels three times doing variations of the same objectives. I wish this was a joke, some kind of metagaming satire about how menial completion can be in a single player campaign, and it is, because it isn’t. even if it has good level design, it has tiring and inexcusable level design, because it repeated entire blocks of content unashamedly, arrogantly, pompously. saying something like, alan wake’s determination and endurance doesn’t waver in the face of futility, or whatever contextualized bull, which doesn’t really match the player psychology of being tired of remedy’s crap. repeating levels, repeating encounters, repeating objectives, repeating story themes. it’s lazy and indefensible, no matter how novel it’s tries to be, it’s crap design.alan wake’s american nightmare is fun to play. it’s only three hours long, so it’s truthfully worth playing. it’s competent enough as game even if it’s surface level and unambitious. I love alan wake’s character. he’s a lovable d-bag with good intentions and a heart of gold. also, he’s a go-getting sharp featured writer, just like I am a handsome, entirely coolheaded writer-man as well. even if I didn’t like anything other than the game’s sensations, I do believe they are enough to carry the game. if you genuinely enjoyed the first game then you’ll be the most disappointed by american nightmare, yet ironically, I think that’s the only audience for this game. american nightmare can only be played as a disappointment. that’s interesting in itself, how its own existence is a mockery, and I find it odd none of this is grudging. it’s nice to play a good game that is trying to be deep, even if it can’t do anything right on a deeper level, as long as it did right on the things that matter. it’s something nothing wants to be and that’s why it functions curiously even if it's ineffective.

												What is next for the champion of light?Alan Wake's American Nightmare is the predecessor to Alan Wake, although not directly a sequel its more of a spin off type thing!Again you play as Alan Wake, the champion of light!  Two years have passed and Alan Wake is still missing! The story again is written and plays out as it does in Alan Wake but this time the horror story that comes to life is about Alan Wakes doppleganger, a warped and twisted version of himself known only as Mr. Scratch. As this is Alans own story he must battle though the Arizona desert and rewrite reality to stop his doppleganger from re-entering reality as Alan Wake and to prevent himself from being trapped in the darkness forever!  The story is about stopping your nemesis but how the story progresses is quite different. To defeat Mr. Scratch you must gather the whole storyline (manuscript pages) by revisiting parts of the story ""Déjà vu"" and in each instance you will go back in time until you find the correct pieces of the story and join them together. As Mr. Scratch has warped reality he will send you back in time to discourage you from finding the pieces! Gameplay is identical to the orignal except for a few new weapons and of course SPIDERS! YES ♥♥♥♥ING TAKEN SPIDERS!Pros:-Light as a weapon-Explains some backstories in it like how Alice and Barry are doing etc etc-Like its successor distrubing and horrifying-Narration takes a different approach similar to how it is done in The Twilight Zone-The arcade feature is lots of fun :P-Great looking game Cons:-The game is pretty short. a whole universe of American Nightmare would've been good-Gameplay is pretty linear right at the start and the fact you have to revisit parts of the game although cool can be boring!But a crtitical success like its predecessor, ticks all my boxes! 10 Foxes out of 10 foxes!

A Paladin’s Review: Alan Wake’s American Nightmare. Budgeted Mediocre Action Schlock Which Is Missing That Extra Something.Genre: Third Person Psychological Horror Thriller Shooter. Developed and Published by: Remedy Entertainment (on PC). Platforms: Windows, Xbox 360.  Copy purchased by myself in a Humble BundleRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]PreambleI had originally played American Nightmare after having finished Alan Wake in May of 2013. However, I was getting pretty tired of the combat system and seeing it repeated without a lot of variety didn’t do much for me at the time. The story’s changed tone didn’t help either. Back then, all I had finished was the first cycle of levels and decided to quit it early. I did review both Alan Wake and American Nightmare then too, where I slamming AN for being a subpar experience. It’s a mistake I’m not proud of but I’m glad to correct it now. So, I’ve completed this nightmare and have my complete thoughts on it. Admittedly, the same issues I had with it back then haven’t changed much. Except for the combat I suppose. This is another review where you have to ignore the Steam rating and read the words to find out my overall feelings for it. Overall Gameplay ThoughtsAlan Wake: American Nightmare is the semi-sequel standalone that Remedy published several years after the release of the original Alan Wake. Released after they stopped working on Alan Wake 2, AN was meant to take the ideas and setting that they had crafted for a demo of AW2 and publish something out of it. When it had become clear to Remedy that the time wasn’t right for a sequel, American Nightmare was created instead while the studio went to its other announced projects. Is this the last word for the Alan Wake series? That seems to be the indication so far but it's entirely possible that Remedy could return to the series. I hope they do because this nightmare ends the series on a rather sour note. American Nightmare plays out like a schlocky episode of the Twilight Zone. Alan Wake is fighting against a new threat from the darkness, Mr. Scratch who looks and sounds like him. Alan finds himself in Spring Falls (AZ) where things don’t seem quite right, he’s being unusually stalwart and the Scratch is over-the-top silly. There’s also this constant narration from a guy that sounds like the narrator from the Twilight Zone who uses the pronoun game way too much. Alan has to figure out what’s going on in order to defeat the trap set by Mr. Scratch. Combat Mechanics and the Psychological TensionAmerican Nightmare lacks a lot of what made the game so tense and didn’t replace it with anything outside of a wider variety of weapons and enemies. Gone are the claustrophobic battles and limited ammunition. Ammo can be found all over these new wide-open spaces. Alan has clearly embraced his role as a warrior of light and I’m ok with that. However, the side effect of this embracing is that the tension of the previous game has been largely muted and it plays out like a fairly standard third person shooter. The major change to combat is the new weapons you can use. Assault rifles, combat shotguns, SMGs and hunting bows just to name a few. They work and sound reasonably good, if a little uninspired. They don’t really add anything to change the combat which is a little disappointing. I mean, we’re talking about a battle between light and darkness. I would have loved to see weapons that could use light or change the battlefield in some way. Instead, light weapons are still the flares, flaregun and flashbang grenades as before. The same tactic of shining a light on the taken till the darkness is gone and opening fire remains. A slightly strange change to the mechanics is that simply shining an unfocused flashlight on taken doesn’t peel away the darkness like it did before. You have to focus the flashlight on each and every one of them. This doesn’t really change the tempo of combat all that much but I felt it was worth noting. The Schlocky StoryThe story plays out after the events of Alan Wake. Alan finds himself in the town of Bright Falls, AZ, in a world where his writing has power. He finds himself fighting against his evil counterpart: Mr Scratch. Who looks and sounds exactly like him except that he’s evil. Mr Scratch has trapped Alan in a time loop with the intent of wearing him down and eventually defeating him. Thereby allowing Mr Scratch to take over his life in the real world. Worse, Alan lost some of his memories and the key to defeating Mr Scratch once and for all. Alan must survive in the trap long enough to piece together a message he sent to himself that will allow him to set a deadly trap for Mr Scratch instead. Which the trap is killing him at a movie theater when the right conditions are met. Once that’s done, Alan apparently is reunited with his wife, Alice Wake. Where the two share a hug and kiss and the story ends. It’s actually kind of anticlimactic. PC SettingsAlan Wake goes for a fairly realistic style that’s less punctuated with the bright lights and dark shadows of the previous title. However, instead of animated in-game cutscenes that the original title did, they go with live-action cutscenes every time Alan Wake and Mr. Scratch “interact”. It’s weird to see it used and I’m not convinced it works. I’m also not convinced by the setting of Arizona’s desert, as it feels way too bare in contrast to the Pacific Northwest’s forested and hilly areas. Side note, there are some awkward animations with facial expressions and body movement that’s bizarre to watch when the characters converse. It’s not enough to ruin the experience but it looks really dated by current standards.Final ThoughtsAmerican Nightmare has some serious problems that seem to stem from its limited budget. It’s missing a lot of what made Alan Wake a good experience, that underlying current of tension is all but gone. The story, writing and acting is schlocky as hell. What some of the characters say sounds weird and Alan Wake seems to be indifferent to most of what’s going on around him. Furthermore, Mr. Scratch fails to be an interesting villain, feeling like a side character most of the time. Probably the most egregious issue is the game making the player repeat the same levels three times. While they don’t have you repeat the exact same dialogues and actions, the repetition is still there and it isn’t interesting. Combat does get some changes but most of it is the inclusion of high powered weapons. Otherwise, fights are mostly set in big open areas where enemies can be seen for miles. It loses the tension fights had in AW and settles for a mostly mediocre third person shooter. Should you pick it up? I can’t decide. There’s nothing actually wrong with AN from a story or game mechanics perspective, it’s just not as good as Alan Wake. There are better titles out there worth checking out in comparison. So, my suggestion would be to think on what I’ve said and see if the change in tone is worth checking out or not.

												A little closure to the previous Alan Wake's game. If you have played Alan Wake and want to know how the story ends, this is it. Story is much shorter and graphics looks different from the Alan Wake. Also for some people this might be a cool feature, this game has Arcade mode, where you can try to kill as many enemies as possible within a time limit and building your combo for higher score. But this mode has a lack of variety. I would rather see a survival without time limit where you can simply shoot enemies without worrying about nothing else.Overall the game is fun but before that you should play Alan Wake.

												I loved Alan Wake. However I was skeptical coming into American Nightmare and rightly so. I'd call AN a spin-off rather than a sequel to Alan Wake given its slightly brighter color palette and more action-oriented gameplay. The story, as well, while having some connections to the original it doesn't have the same amount of effort put into it and seems to only be there so that there's something to call a story.However, the game itself is not delluding itself that it's something that it's not. I feel this was done consciously to give Alan Wake fans a quick fix of what they liked while I suspect a sequel is in the works. But therein lies the game's biggest caveat: It's a game for Alan Wake fans. People coming into the series with American Nightmare will find themselves confused and lacking valuable backstory information, no matter the game's good intentions and attempts to bring everyone up to speed.The graphics are doing new and interesting things with color and lighting in this new western desert setting as opposed to the gray and blue of the Rocky Mountains' nights in the previous game, but the soundtrack seems to fall short this time, lacking the storyline integration that made the first one great.All in all in spite of all this I had fun with Alan Wake's American Nightmare and I'm giving it a thumbs up, but with a footnote: For fans of the series.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a third-person action/thriller shooter (more on the action side of things than its predecessor) which completes the story set out in the original game. Most of the gameplay is the same, but the combat controls are tightened up nicely to the point where this instance of the game is the best in the series.The best part of this game is that is has some fun with the premise and makes for an interesting twist which doesn't overstay its welcome. It's rather short - maybe 4 hours - but still well worth having. Ideally, you'd pick it up in a Franchise pack with the original game, but if you're picking it up independently, it's well worth having. Highly recommended.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												Although better graphics, nice (finnaly) 60 Hz, this stand alone expansion lacks the deep story from the fist Alan Wake. Don`t get me wrong - it is truly great EXPANSION with a lot of fun inside, but it is really too short for my taste. Repeating the same maps is not bad for the atmosphere, but I`ll hardly worth replay of whole the game again... What am I saying - the story is brilliant again, makes hint of sequence, but we are still waiting...Play this game only if you want the story from original Alan Wake expanded.

Positives:+ Enjoyable graphic style+ Voiceovers+ Story (at least the first ""go through"")+ Mechanics are interestingNegatives:- You essentially repeat the same story three times.  There are some shortcuts in the later versions, but this was still annoying- Some of the conversations are needlessly long and uninteresting- Short.  I finished the game in 3.8 hours, and considering you repeat essentially the same story multiple times, that story is pretty brief.Comments:I purchased the original Alan Wake game with no real expectations, and was extremely surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  American Nightmare has the same interesting mechanics, but the story is not nearly as well done, and the fact that you basically repeat the same thing multiple times is disappointing.  Still, it was enough fun that, if you liked the original Alan Wake, it's worth a playthrough if you can pick it up on sale.Rating: 6.5/10 ",631,158,15,56,43,8,53

 Alan Wake's American Nightmare  Another part of the adventures of Alan Wake which in my opinion departs from the original. The game is also hard to be considered a full-fledged production. Why? Since the beginning of the game might be interested for the player but after passing game again throws us at the beginning of the game and we have to do everything from the beginning. Of course, the game was too bad for players so each time is easier to do the things that we need to do to progess. The game happening in Arizona near the road 66. Story looks average. Our hero finds that he went into the series of TV program ""Night Springs"" which he wrote the script and must defeat his enemy Mr. Scratch. The game still runs on the same mechanics, we use light to defeat the enemies and the game turned into a shooter. A large number of different weapons gives you some fun. There is also an additional mode ""Fight Till Dawn"", where our goal is to survive wave after wave of enemies until dawn and collect points and compete with your friends. The game is not as good as the original but it gives you a bit of fun especially since you can get this game cheap on sales. ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Upon the announcement and subsequent release of American Nightmare I was pretty hyped. After investing many hours into Alan Wake, and staying active in the community waiting with bated breath for the sequel, American Nightmare came along and I was ready to dive in. First off, there were many notable improvements over the first Alan Wake. Sprint duration and enemy variability were welcome changes - and the variety amongst weapons were interesting, fun and added a bit of incentive to track down more manuscript pages. The narrative was interesting, although it becomes a little repetitive -- if you don't know what I mean, you'll see. It's not at all bad, but didn't leave me particularly inclined to have another go at the game's story. The arcade mode is fun, challenging, but wasn't something I'd spend days playing. American Nightmare is not the sequel to Alan Wake, but it's still more Alan Wake which was more than I could ask for. If you're interested in returning to the Dark Place and spending some fun hours shooting up some Taken - have at it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake American Nightmare pretty much feels like B-Movie quality ""direct to DVD""Release sequel of it's AAA Big Screen successor. While this doesn't necessarily make it a bad game, one should approach it keeping this in mind. Gameplay mechanics stay the same and are as rebust as ever and the amount of weapons and enemy variety has been largly increased. However the story itself feels pretty cheap and cheesy, but being presented as a ""Night Springs"" episode, I did enjoy the overall B-Movie feeling. Overall I'd say it's worth checking out for fans of the original Alan Wake and definitly worth buying when on sale!!			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												I only have about 5 hours on this game. In those five short hours of playing, I finished the story, and played the ""Fight Until Dawn"" mode a good few times. Honestly, there's just not enough content here, the story in this one hails in comparison to the original, and the whole game is just passing through one area three times. The absolute definition of repetitive. I loved the first Alan Wake, and while this game was fun for the five short hours I played it, it's not good enough. Feels like a lazy cash-in on the fans of the original, to be honest. If you absolutely must have more Alan Wake, and you've already beat the original, just go play the DLC for the original.

												This was an OK experience. It was fun and quick which is a positive. Definitely not worth more than 5 bucks in my opinion. Compared to the original Alan Wake experience this is nothing compared to that. The animation is lack-luster, the same settings are re-used (although it makes sense why, the settings get a bit stale). There is next to no challenge, and there isn't even a final boss battle.

												During the first hour of this I was sure I was going to write a ”Not Recommended” review. But after the second half turned out to be much stronger than the first I’m split. American Nightmare has many issues stemming from the fact that it was a low budget project compared to the full game. It has few of the outstanding production values that usually define Remedy titles. The music is nice, the writing is strong, and the combat is much improved by a greater variety of enemies. But the environments often feel like they belong in a shoddy mid budget title made by newbies. It’s blocky, blurry and uses simplistic lighting. Nothing like the original Alan Wake which is one of the best looking games of the past generation. What came as a positive surprise was the story. I was sure it was going to be a nonsensical mess. But it turned out to be a worthy successor to Alan Wake. It felt well thought out, focused, and it made sense as a sequel. I would’ve liked to see this as a proper full game, with some of the ideas fleshed out more. In the original you picked up torn out pages which belonged to the story that was playing itself out in the game. They were a neat idea, but I didn't feel like they added too much. In American Nightmare they bridge the gap between the two years that have passed since the end of Alan Wake and what is happening now. You find out what happened to all the characters you met, and more importantly where Alan now finds himself and what he’s really trying to do. Instead of being filler the pages feel like a critical component to understanding and fully appreciating the story. I’m not sure if there’s really any point in playing this. But I enjoyed it, and the ending wraps up the entire Alan Wake story in a way I liked. I doubt we’ll see any more games in this series, and I’m happy with the ending I got here. If only it had been given production values on the level of Burial at Sea Part 2.			",277,52,9,27,7,0,6

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a fun game. But compared to its predecessor, it is definitely not as good. It doesn't live up to the first Alan Wake, mainly because they didn't put as much effort into it.On the good side of things, Alan Wake's American Nightmare presents a brand new story that is very interesting, but it is a bit of a stretch from the first game. The weapon system is fun, making you collect manuscript pages to unlock new guns. The enemies are also new, improving on the plain minions from the previous installments. They introduce an all new Arcade Mode as well, and it provides entertainment for those that have finished the Main Story. Plus the game improves on the graphics, looking better than ever.But, there are some bad things. The story is extremely short, especially taking into account you go to the same areas 3 times. Yes, it is a part of the story, but they should've considered making it more interesting. Increasing the difficulty each time isn't going to win you Game of the Year. The story in itself gets pretty boring. Fans of Alan Wake will enjoy it more, but it just doesn't pull you in. It doesn't do very much to keep your interest, relying on the gamer to finish the game just because they paid money for it, and they should get their money's worth. The new characters (everyone except Alan) are not that enticing either; they don't make you sympathize/get attached to them. And finally, the game is easy. I beat the game in three hours. That's just unprofessional.It may sound like I hate the game, but I don't. The story is an episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote, putting Mr. Wake in a time loop set by his dark side. Alan must perfect everything in order to defeat his evil self, or be sent back in time to relive the defeat all over again, until he suceeds. The ending is decent, and it isn't that bad of a story overall. But it fails to make an impression that rivals the previous game or any other best seller. There is some replay value, but not much. The Arcade Mode is pretty much the only reason to go back to the game.In summary, this game is for fans of Alan Wake. So make sure you've played that one first. The game has an okay story, but some great improvement, like new enemies and better graphics, but it just isn't as good as the first.Score: 7/10 - Good			",126,15,0,6,4,0,3

												This is not like the first Alan Wake. It pales in comparison. It doesn't deserve the Alan Wake name. It was so repetitive. The voice acting made me throw up a little in my mouth. I didn't play through this game in a couple of days, the way I did with the first one, I had to take long breaks from it and then painstakingly try and chug through it. The ending was anti-climatic, and I kept wishing over and over again that it would be finally finished. I had high hopes for this. Hopes that were crushed. The arcade mode is kinda fun, I guess. But definitely was not worth the price I paid for this game. I'm very disappointed. Don't buy it unless it's on sale, and even then, be careful.			",32,8,0,0,4,0,0

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is more an expansion of some sort to the original game than a proper sequel.While the gameplay is exactly the same as Alan Wake, this downloadble title makes two little mistakes:1) Pumping up the action a bit too much for a game that is supposed to be some kind of survival horror: in American Nightmare your weapons do a lot more damage and refilling your ammo and throwable weapons becomes a trivial affair. Suffice to say, running from enemies doesn't have much sense anymore. The more variability with the Taken does so little to makes things harder, unfortunately2) The game is basically about three distinct locations that you have to visit thrice each. While I kind of expect to revisit levels in roleplaying and open world games, I don't like doing so in action adventures and horror titles. While this design is perfect, storywise, it can't help but to feel annoying and tiresomeThe new arcade mode is basically a hold the line mode against endless waves of Taken and nothing more. It's a quest to unlock all the available maps and reaching the highest score possibleTherefore I consider Alan Wake's American Nightmare a weaker expansion for the original game, but quite fair, given its price			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												In Alan Wake's American Nightmare you're basically playing through an episode ""Night Springs"" which is highly inspired by ""The Twilight Zone"". Alan is stuck in a loop in time due to Mr. Scratch rewinding back time every time you get close to defeating him. You'll only be playing through three different areas, sounds like it would be extremely short right? Well, it is. Remedy padded the game at an attempt to make it longer by making you replay those three areas NINE times total. Why nine times you're asking, right? Because each time you change something in each area and this is ultimately how you defeat Mr. Scratch.The game is far from bad, but it does suffer from repetition. There's not many weapons to use, ammo is scattered all over each area so there's never really any intense moments.  The game can get intense when Taken gang up on you, but it's never that difficult to dodge their attacks and even if they do get close to you all you got to do is shine your light on them and they'll back off.I recommend the game if you liked the previous game, otherwise you'll have a bad time with American Nightmare.

												This is the sequel to the other Alan Wake game, titled Alan Wake.  This game is titled ""Alan Wake's American Nightmare""  This game is a pretty cool guy, being set in Arizona, it's 20% cooler than the previous title in this series, and way more better than most titles not set in Arizona.  The game feels very much like playing an old 1950s B-Movie, only without all of the Bees.  The Giant Spiders are still present, but not untill the second level.  In this game you play as Alan Wake, and are having an American Nightmare.  That is that this game assumes you failed to keep the illegals out in Tom Clancy's Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, and now there are Illegals all across America.  The Illegals have taken peoples jobs, and their dogs, and other things.  They're living in houses paid for by the government, with health care subsidies paid for by the government, and all kinds of other wrong.  Alan has to take his trusty shotgun and drive them back across the border.			",387,104,4,73,21,4,49

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a good game, if you take into account the price. It only costs $10, before any potential sale, and if you like the original Alan Wake, then it is worth picking up. It's not perfect. There are only three levels that you repeat three times each due to time travel effects. However, there's enough variety in enemies and weapons that it is still worth your money and time.

												Have you ever wanted to save the world from an evil darkness hell bent on taking over your life before destroying everyone and everything it possibly can? Then this might be the game for you.Once again you take on the role of Alan Wake and his fight against the encroaching all powerful darkness. Blow away every evil being that wonders into your crosshairs using a large array of weapons, one that would make any gun enthusiast dance with glee. My favourite happened to be the nail gun, simple but deadly. Also the unique ability to use the beam from your flashlight to weaken your foes is back once again, something that I really enjoyed from the original.The gameplay is very similar to the first title but this time it has a more arcady feel to it, especially with a score attack mode running parallel to the main story. It does add a lot of gameplay value but can be very repetitive continually killing the same sets of enemies over and over again. As for the story itself, it carries the same dark humour as many other of Remedies titles even using the Twilight zone styled Night Springs as the main way to convey the story. The game is not overly long and does feel repetitive in nature, mainly due to using the same levels over and over but given the time bending storyline that is not surprising. I didn’t get bored at all and had a real desire to find out what happened to our hero in the end and whether or not he would have his happy ending.If you have played and liked the original then this is a must buy especially if on sale, if not just to complete the story arc from the first game. If you are new to the series don’t start with this one, but buy the original as it is a phenomenal game. Have Fun ^_^ ",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												I got this game because the original Alan Wake was a great game. The gameplay and graphics were almost the same. There were some changes, like new weapons and stuff, but overall there is a lot less content in this game compared to the original one. The story was okay, but not even close as good as the original one. It also gets repetitive, because you're going to be moving through the same places over and over again. Overall, I had fun playing it, but by the end of it, I felt a bit bored, because I kept going through the same places and doing the same things over and over. I'd still recommend it though if you have a few hours to waste and have enjoyed the first one, you might as well like this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me Alan Wake was just another average game with fun gunplay, repetetive gameplay and pretty meh story. Nothing special really.From the other hand, American Nightmare feels like a proper sequel.It fixed many little problems that I have with it - increase of stamina, faster battery charge, HUD is more clean, you pick up everything at once from the box, map is giving you more important information, dialogue is not that long anymore, locations and story are far more interesting etc beside one thing - you still can't skip dialogue and most of cutscenes.You also get way more weapons, new quite original enemy types and extra Arcade Mode - or more like a horde mode with few maps available where you are trying to survive and get as many points you can.  A small yet cool addition for people who enjoys gunplay of Alan Wake.For a DLC with horde mode and 5 hour long story mode, American Nightmare feels way, way better polished video game than Alan Wake itself.

What I liked: I like the villain, Scratch is cool,would love to see him in the next game :O Story is told like a Twilight Zone episode( Love it so much, huge fan of this style) New enemy types that mix it up( light splitting enemies, and raven/humanoid enemy)What You Need to Know: Repeating the same events over is kinda lazy to me, story wise still a weak excuse( probably used to cut corners to save money :( Despite repeating events, it's changed up enough that you aren't doing the same thing everytime. Story to me was lame compared to the base game( no mystery/horror/side characters) Even easier than the base game, it has respawning ammo boxes #FAIL No ammo or battery conservation on the hardest difficulty needed like the base game Seriously though, that crossbow is way OP, balance issues aheadCompared to Original: More action oriented gameplay with more deadly weapons( full auto baby) No more stupid thermos to collect, just manuscripts( they are used to unlock new weapons) Live action scenes are welcome, even if a little bland( better than plastic dolls)My Score:CPrice:$5 in Humble BundleCompleted in: 3 hoursGames that are better:  The original ",224,25,1,13,29,1,28

												I am the Champion of the Light! This wasnt what i expected. but it was still really fun. The first one was more story based driven, This one not so much. Its repetitive, Literally. But the third time is the charm. I played on Normal mode and it was a breeze and a very short game, The nail gun is pretty OP. Handling is good, graphics good. I did run into a problem. This has No steam overlay for me which made talking to others during game play annoying. I give this a 6/10, simply because it was so short and not as story driven as i would prefered.

												I didn't like this game. It was well until i had to repeat the whole game sequence again, and then again, seriously, its this way the game goes, you have to repeat the same levels 3 times. But this isn't the only fault of the game, the storytelling is awful, the lines are horrible and cheesy, the manuscript pages are a little better, but the overall experience is bad.The ending is horrible aswell and turns the whole process of playing the game useless. I don't recomend this game, if you haven't played Dead Space yet, i recomend spending your time with it instead.			",138,15,11,11,5,0,5

												Alan Wake game was good, the gameplay is not without issues namely the framerates slows down even on low settings. American Nightmare was a bit of of an improvement although the narrator was different and the UI is not similar as well. The story is not satisfactory, it is like a B-movie follow up of the original Alan Wake game. Then the 2nd part of the game gets the ultimate stick-up-your♥♥♥♥♥surprise, you will repeat the whole game again with slightly harder opponents. Although I appreciate the evolved opponents the idea of repeating the game is annoying WTF moment. I like the first Alan Wake so I continue playing then bam! You will repeat the first chapter thrice! 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times! I gave up and decided to write this review to give the American Nightmare it deserve, A ♥♥♥♥ing NIGHTMARE!! playing MMO with repetitive quests is already annoying but an action-adventure game to have this kind of story is just ♥♥♥♥ed up!! So I cannot recommend this American Nightmare. Play Alan Wake original and just watch a video of the gameplay of AW:AM on youtube, for it will destroy what you love about Alan Wake.

												Well .. After i finished Alan Wake (DLC also) i wanted to try that game .. my first impressions, HUD was wierd (HP bar ? what's wrong ..) but ok i started playing was not bad after one thing .. all pages are marked on your minimap ... seriously ? in Alan Wake it was hidden and what here ? .... second thing there are 3 maps .. YES 3 that u play 3 times EACH third thing .. well i don't think that Alan Wake need THAT many weapons .. because this supposed to be ACTION/THRILLER not a TPS .. and now some details. Why just why in this game the best weapon is (WAIT FOR IT ........) a crossbow .. so what .. bolts for shadows are like pins and garlic for vampires ? seriously that is sick ... and soundtrack .. well maybe i'm not fan of that type of music but for me in Alan Wake it was totally BETTER than in this .. you will also ask me why i don't said about storyline ? well because this don't exist for me in this game .. If you want to try this game, well i will just recommend to see ending of that game and that's all, and just wait for Alan Wake 2 and have hope that Alan Wake 2 will be better than THAT.

												A fun spin-off to the original Alan Wake (though it does actually continue the same story, so you could take this as a sequel as well) that manages to lose some of the narrative charm, but improves on the combat in almost every way. The story is so so, having you play through the same three areas three times across all the acts, which got tiring after the second time through. There's an explanation for why you do it, but seeing the same areas across 6-8 hours is disappointing. On the bright side, it is less linear than the original, but that's only if you care to search for collectibles (only manuscript pages this time around).The new arcade mode is a welcome addition, though, which has you playing through 10 minutes as waves of Taken attack your position. Most of the maps provide one position that you can abuse if you're just looking to 3 star the levels, but that's a choice you can make so I have a hard time complaining about it.It's not Alan Wake 2, but still worth your time if you're looking for more Alan Wake.

												A wonderful addition to the Alan Wake story and a fairly nice way to see what happens at the end of the first game. The mechanics have been improved and the flow is much cleaner. The added weapons and enemies give it a newer varied feel for this short story. The story though is a bit lacking in comparison to the original, though if played together they create a cohesive story. A great game to go with the original, but not very good as a standalone.

												The original Alan Wake was a recent favourite of mine and as this was released not too long after. I expected much of the same. I was dissapointed overall. The story in the original was definitely one of the factors that caused me to enjoy it. The story in this however is very lame. It is convoluted and underwhelming where the previous impressed. I am also dissapointed that they made this more action based as they had a good ratio of story/action/adventure in the original. Another negative is the fact that realistically the enviroments and story have enough material that would last two hours and could have been a pretty cool DLC to Alan Wake. However instead you are forced to repeat the whole game pretty much three times before it is complete due to a 'time loop' (Told you it was lame). Ironically enough I would recommend this if you enjoyed the original (especially the story or action) as it does follow on from the original and adds some clarity and depth to some of the unresolved questions I had after the first story. Would recommend waiting for a sale. 5/10			",363,183,6,52,48,7,63

												I loved this game to no end, it is by far one of my favorite games of all time.I actualy liked it better than the original, lemme do a pro con thingy.Pros:Better weapons and combat.Arcade action is a blast.Most sadistic villain I have ever fought, providing a extremley satasfying ending.More cool soundtrack.Cons:Story gets repetitive since alan only visits 3 small areas.The whole time you will meet 4 people, 3 random girls and mr scratch, all the girls are unintresting and do nothing to better the story.Camera angles can be realy annoying at times.Its is absolutley manditory to zoom in now, no more just shining the light around to preserve batteries.While Im on the topic of batteries, they are way to easy to get.Normal mode provides little challenge, I was able to mow down 2 king hillbillys with a normal shotgun and flare gun without a problem.After you beat the game, you cannot get the soundtrack for listening in game, or download, like the base game gave you.Im pretty sure all multiplayer leaderboards have been hacked for #1 score.Spiders. Why? The server no purpose other than to annoy you a little bit.There are realy only a few weapons you'll ever use.A few suggestions:Co-op arcade mode would be a fun addition.Loadouts, arcade mode would do good with loadouts.Tighten the physisics up a bit, everything feels a bit to light (hehe, see what I did there?).More inspired characters please?Better enemys. The taken are not zombies, I would like to see more then 3 enemy models, and the special takens only get one model.Name it better. Was the original Alan Wake not in america or something?More TV shows, I know you were actualy in the TV show in this game, but some of my favorite parts of alan wake were pausing to watch Night Springs.Less linear please, the original alan wake was linear, but it gave the allusion of being open level.Cars?  Why doesnt alan just drive through the gates right up to wherever he's going? And, did he seriously drive a FREAKIN MINIVAN?More special taken. Even with the special taken, there was realy only 3 types. Charger, Crow, King hillbilly.

												A fantastic addition to the series! They take a lot of the strengths from the first game and keep them in place, but they also take a bunch of the weaknesses as well and greatly improve them. In comparison, this game is much easier than Alan Wake but I had so much fun playing it the difficulty nerf didn't really bother me. Finally there is a larger selection of weapons, but to be honest my favorites ended up being the standard issue 9mm pistol, and the crossbow, together they got the job done clean and quickly. If you are familiar with the predecessor to this game, the flash bangs and flare gun have been nerfed as well, but with a decent amount of balance. Ammo conservation isn't nearly as pertinent in this edition with the abundant and refilling ammo caches in each zone. Exploring isn't nearly as nerve racking or dangerous as well, which is a bit of a letdown.********ATTENTION: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD********The story of this game is solid, but also unoriginal. The whole idea of a repeating day has been done a lot, but it somewhat fits in with the setting of Night Springs that the game presents. Still not 100% sure if this is just another episode, or if it actually happened. Either way, the change of setting is very welcomed and the new enemies are a nice addition. I do enjoy the idea of dealing with a doppelganger though, and Mr Scratch pulls it off VERY well, I actually really like the guy.********END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS********As for rating, on an enjoyment level I would give this game a solid 8.5 / 10 if you are just in it for how fun the game is. If you want to be a stickler and rate the actual level of design and originality in the game, it would have to be a 7 / 10. Either way, this is still a damn good game, especially if you played Alan Wake.			",213,57,2,21,21,2,19

A good game if you want something that isn't a DLC for the original game and you want to keep playing Alan Wake. You can play the arcade mode if you wanna some action-based gameplay and no story.

												It has been quite a while since i played Alan Wake.  Playing this one, brought back the old feeling and made me reinstall the original version, which is way better. Still i enjoyed this one a lot too.  Alan's evil side is truly twisted! Adding the arcade mode is a very nice touch, but it is not really my playstyle, so I did not really look into it.  It will take you a good evening, maybe 2, to finish the main storyline.It has a high replay value, specially  if you want to make all achievements and find all goodies, like radio and tv shows.And even more if you are into arcade mode. Loved playing it! Again thsi eery atmosphere that makes your skin crawl.  I did find this one way easier as the original Alan wake  (specially in nightmare mode;) ",184,112,4,18,14,3,18

												An improvement over the original game's double-DLC epilogue that, despite ending great-ish, left me with mixed feelin's. AN's story as it relates to AW boggled the mind, but it's still damn good in the realm of video games; more self-aware flirtations with storytelling tropes, this time more thoroughly entrenched in AW's schlocky influences.The story's 'bout half the length of AW's, but feels far shorter due to the limited scope & # of explorable environments. 3 maps, each repeated 3 times in a time loop. I tend to hate time loop stories, but this one left a mostly pos. impression. It's reasoning is believable in the context of the story, but that doesn't stop it from occas. feeling like a sad excuse to lengthen the game. (I love the changes b/w repeats, e.g., NPCs recognizing you and starting to understand their places in the loop--esp. the scientist's 4th-wall commentary on being unable to remember anything outside of her purpose in Wake's story.)Out of room. Solid continuation.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												I kinda soured on Alan Wake after loving the core game and not really liking the first two DLC packs for it.  I thought this was a nice return to form.  The gameplay is pretty combat-heavy, but I had fun with it.  You go through three different environments, three times each, which gets a bit repetitive, but they change things up just enough that it's not terrible.  Mostly it was the writing, the radio shows, the TVs and the manuscript pages littered about that really added depth and color to a fairly simple plot.  All in all, it was a short, fairly tight, and enjoyable experience.			",152,83,2,16,8,2,26

												If you are a fan of Alan wake then you have to give this game a try.  The game play is as addictive as the first, but a downside is that you play through the same maps three times.  The setting can become rather dull BUT all that aside this is an excellent game 7/10.			",24,9,0,7,0,0,0

												A wonderful addition to the Alan Wake story and a fairly nice way to see what happens at the end of the first game. The mechanics have been improved and the flow is much cleaner. The added weapons and enemies give it a newer varied feel for this short story. The story though is a bit lacking in comparison to the original, though if played together they create a cohesive story. A great game to go with the original, but not very good as a standalone.

												The original Alan Wake was a recent favourite of mine and as this was released not too long after. I expected much of the same. I was dissapointed overall. The story in the original was definitely one of the factors that caused me to enjoy it. The story in this however is very lame. It is convoluted and underwhelming where the previous impressed. I am also dissapointed that they made this more action based as they had a good ratio of story/action/adventure in the original. Another negative is the fact that realistically the enviroments and story have enough material that would last two hours and could have been a pretty cool DLC to Alan Wake. However instead you are forced to repeat the whole game pretty much three times before it is complete due to a 'time loop' (Told you it was lame). Ironically enough I would recommend this if you enjoyed the original (especially the story or action) as it does follow on from the original and adds some clarity and depth to some of the unresolved questions I had after the first story. Would recommend waiting for a sale. 5/10			",363,183,6,52,48,7,63

												A fun spin-off to the original Alan Wake (though it does actually continue the same story, so you could take this as a sequel as well) that manages to lose some of the narrative charm, but improves on the combat in almost every way. The story is so so, having you play through the same three areas three times across all the acts, which got tiring after the second time through. There's an explanation for why you do it, but seeing the same areas across 6-8 hours is disappointing. On the bright side, it is less linear than the original, but that's only if you care to search for collectibles (only manuscript pages this time around).The new arcade mode is a welcome addition, though, which has you playing through 10 minutes as waves of Taken attack your position. Most of the maps provide one position that you can abuse if you're just looking to 3 star the levels, but that's a choice you can make so I have a hard time complaining about it.It's not Alan Wake 2, but still worth your time if you're looking for more Alan Wake.

												American Nightmare is part of the Alan Wake universe. If you did not play Alan Wake before, the story will feel strange to you.A short but entertaining piece. Reuse of environment felt in line with ingame lore. Still, its something like an epilogue rather than a self-contained game proper.Next game: Quantum Break.			",192,47,9,26,31,3,21

Alan Wake's American Nightmare is more like a sidestory or we can say a DLC, but if you finish the Alan Wake and liked it, definitely you have to play, because this game, has correlation with Alan Wake, had a different and great story.Also we have more weapons on this game, and Arcade mode is also so fun, i feel like playing Dead Rising when i play on Arcade Mode, and could be better if you play Arcade Mode after finishing the Story, because you have to find manuscript paces to open other weapons, unlike Alan Wake manuscript paces more useful on American Nightmare

More simplized combat with a slew of weapons give added depth into a short game along with a arcade mode that has you fighting till dawn will have you playing long pass the story ends.

												Alan's Wake American Nightmare is the pseudo follow-up/se to the well received Alan Wake. It is a 3rd person shooter which controls exactly the same as the first game. American Nightmare improves drastically on one of the few low points of the original Alan Wake, the combat. A.N. adds several new weapons and enemy types. These additions would have been welcome earlier, since it grew tiresome using the same 4 weapons in Alan Wake and fighting the same enemies over the 10 hours the game took to beat. However, I could see how the weaponry might not have fit in that atmosphere. The variations in the enemy types help keep the combat fresh as you continue through the estimated 3-4 hour campaign.The real standout in Alan Wake, the story, really takes a backseat in American Nightmare to the improved combat. While it will catch your attention at the beginning, I eventually found myself just wanting it to be over. Most of that I believe is due to the Groundhog Day esque nature of this installment, where you will be going through some of the same areas and events multiple times. It just fails to really engross you all the way through like Alan Wake did.Speaking of the environments, they are a nice change of pace from the Pacific Northwest. The events take place in Night Springs, Arizona, a fictional town which is the setting of an in-game TV show. You will be running around through some desert landscape for a few hours, but this game is shorter so it doesn't wear out its welcome like the forest did.The graphics have seen a slight improvement from the previous game, with the character animation looking much better, but still not stellar. The sound is also fantastic once again, with some great soundtrack moments during some battles.I would recommend American Nightmare to fans of the original Alan Wake for two reasons. If you liked the combat, which some did, you will love the additions to the weaponry and enemies. If you liked the story, which most did, you will be interested in finding out what happens next to our protagonist. If you have not played Alan Wake, I would recommend picking that up before trying out American Nightmare. There are too many spoilers for the events of the first game, and it would ruin the experience.Grade: B-			",777,367,21,112,93,8,122

												Alan Wake finds himself in an episode of the fictional TV show, ""Night Springs,"" in which he must defeat his evil doppleganger Mr. Scratch and prevent him from entering our realm. As a side story to the first game, the fun gameplay and graphics quality is still present, yet the story mode is much more repetitive, and you'll probably get irritated at how much the game repeats itself. The arcade mode, however, is a ton of fun and saves the game from being bad. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. Definitely recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kazda zmena v danom useku nejako zmeni dej a posuniete sa dalej k zniceniu pana temnout . Boj je voci miestnym ludom ktori su posadnuty temnotou . V kazdej dalsej linii hry sa mani obtiaznost pribudaju novy a tazsi nepriatelia dochadza municia a podobne. Ked uz nahodou dokoncite hru na urovni nočna mora tak sa vam odomkne takzvany survival mod ktory je asi tak isto dlhy ako sama hras s pribehom . Cela nočna mora sa týka prezit s minimum municie a stale pribudajucim poctom posadnutych preckat noc s brokovnicou a magnum , 10 baterkami  do vychdu slnka ktore zacina za 10 minut. tuto hru z mojho pohlada napriek tomu ze pribeh bol slaby opakovane prostredie ale ta dejova linia ma dostala ale napriek tomu vsetkemu ma to donutilo dat neuveritelne hodnotenie 9/10 a lot of words about one game so we'll start this game is made for mild horror style but some time times the jumpscream .CEL game sits in a short stretch of gameplay that are 3x repeated collie temporal rift and NAZ main character Alan Wake fighter of evil and darkness was Mr. Pokora trying darkness makes us want to Chiti trap but just then the temporal give breaks and return time to the beginning of the game where you try to save people who have conquered the Prince of Darkness. Any change in the given section give some change and a shift to the further destruction of the Dark. The fight is held by local people who are obsessed with darkness. In each subsequent line games are mani difficulty have new and harder enemies comes about ammunition and the like. When by chance to finish the game at the level of a nightmare so will unlock the So called Survival mode which is about the same way as the debt itself you play a story. The whole nightmare relates to survive with a minimum of ammunition and still grow in number, possessed outlast night with a shotgun and a magnum, 10 batteries for the eastern part of the sun which begins in 10 minutes. this game from my point of view despite the fact that the story was weak but repeatedly setting the storylines got me yet everything has forced them to unbelievable data evaluation 09/10			",173,29,3,6,12,2,10

												American Nightmare is a follow-up to Alan Wake, which for the record I found surprisingly enjoyable, if decidedly corny. Originally a short DLC game on consoles, it was developed on a limited budget that really shows. But the way they used that budget is clever.To spoil mildly, this game involves you replaying a series of events a la Groundhog Day, so if the idea of repetitive content really bugs you, you may want to stay away. But the way it handles each loop is clever, with surprises I didn't expect and and awareness of it all that works, and so I'm generally willing to forgive them using that premise to squeeze extra playtime out of a relatively small environment. Game play for the most part mirrors Alan Wake, though there's a bit more of an emphasis on the gunplay, but with the standard survival horror need to conserve resources when possible. It's decent, but the same issues come back - it's a bit repetitive, and Alan can have trouble with camera angles, but he has more firepower and tricks this time around, which mitigates it slightly.Like its predecessor, it uses light well as a mechanic, particularly towards the end, and offers up a cheesy b-movie 90s horror feel obviously inspired Stephen King's Dark Half. The ending just kind of trails off much like Alan Wake, which may frustrate some. It's not for everyone, and I feel like my recommendation is more tenative than that for Alan Wake itself, but if you enjoyed Alan Wake, this is worth taking for a spin.			",506,140,11,70,29,5,65

												To start with, I really enjoyed the original Alan Wake.  The setting, the writing, the mechanics, all good.In some ways, this game is more of the same.   Burn away darkness, blow away zom-.. sorry, ""Taken"".But where Alan Wake's combat got pretty samey a few chapters in, American Nightmare's combat got samey almost immediately, and although Wake is supposed to be experienced at this sort of thing now, there was basically no tension.  There were quite a few ""Oh crap"" moments in the first game where the game would have a genuine surprise ready to throw at me. Not so in Nightmare.The story (though I will not spoil) is also pretty light-weight.  The big bad shows up to taunt you, throws some mooks at you, rinse and repeat.  The nature of the Wakeverse is such that ambiguity about what's going on is entirely appropriate, but in Nightmare the writers seemed to use it as an excuse to avoid writing.Buy Alan Wake, but you can readily give this one a pass.

												American Nightmare is quite different from it's predecessor in crucial points and not always for the best. Therefor, the pros and cons rely a lot on comparison with Alan Wake.Pros:+ Collecting manuscrpit pages now has a clear benefit that was absent in it's predecessor.+ New cool enemies.+ Intelligent AI, the enemies try to surround you whenever possible.+ Loot and pick-ups are well marked.+ Plenty of ammo.+ Open world.+ Battery change is quicker than in Alan Wake.+ Usage of real actors in cut scenes.Cons:- From visual point of view it's a step back from Alan Wake.- This sequel feels more like a game. It's predecessor had such a high standard of realism that it felt more life-like.- The graphics are worse than in Alan Wake.- Bad dialogues.- Bad characters and voiceover.- Feels like it was done before the main game.- You couldn't choose weather you wanted to leave an area.- Switching weapons is hard in the middle of a battle.- Less atmosphere = enemies weren't that scary.- I thought there'd be a final battle thing, it never came.Verdict:American Nightmare often felt raw, it's state of completion rushed. Several of the choices that the developers made leave you thinking what they had in mind. So, it's not the Alan Wake you think you'd get after what they had done previously. Nevertheless I recommend it, after all we are talking about an Alan Wake game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a huge fan of the Alan Wake universe and the lore Sam Lake/Remedy created with the first game, so of course I absolutely loved American Nightmare. Being quicker paced and more action packed with a large variety of weapons, including a nail gun and assault rifle, American Nightmare is a pulp fiction video game galore. It's pulp fiction because of how it's told, the narrative is that Alan Wake wrote himself into an episode of Night Springs just so he can slip into reality from the darkness and kill Mr. Scratch, the doppleganger that appears at the end of Alan Wake. I absolutely love the art style Remedy approached when recreating a sort of desert town in Arizona, the canyons, cacti, shrubs, and red rocks really stand out. Textures could be higher quality, but originally being an XBLA game, I'm assuming they had to consolidate the sizes. A shame they didn't go all out on the PC port though. Another thing I enjoyed was the semi-open world they layed out. The game is split into three areas, the Motel area, Observation tower area, and the drive-in theater. Each of the levels are rather small, but open enough that you can explore to find the manuscript pages and take in the details.Basically, I really liked this game. It could have been longer, and the textures could have been higher quality, but I understand that they weren't able to make American Nightmare a full game as Microsoft wanted Remedy to start working on the upcoming Quantum Break, which I hope comes to PC. The ending of Nightmare leaves me wanting more though, I need to find out what happens to Alan Wake. I just hope Remedy makes the long awaited sequel some day.9.0/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is the sequel to Alan Wake and while it is not as good, it's still a great game. The game tells the story of how Alan returns to the real world. The story uses an interesting mechanic that is both good and bad. The player will wplay though the same levels a few times, with the sasme objectives but more enemies and more weapons to find. The causes the game to become repetitive and boring, since the player knows what the objectives are. This make sense from the story pespective, but doen't leave room for anything drastically new. There are a few twists and turns, but they are predictable or not very good. The gameplay is mostly the same, except for a few new weapons.  The game lasts for about 5 hours and are still very enjoyable, it's just not as good as the original.			",383,62,12,32,26,3,50

												To start with, I really enjoyed the original Alan Wake.  The setting, the writing, the mechanics, all good.In some ways, this game is more of the same.   Burn away darkness, blow away zom-.. sorry, ""Taken"".But where Alan Wake's combat got pretty samey a few chapters in, American Nightmare's combat got samey almost immediately, and although Wake is supposed to be experienced at this sort of thing now, there was basically no tension.  There were quite a few ""Oh crap"" moments in the first game where the game would have a genuine surprise ready to throw at me. Not so in Nightmare.The story (though I will not spoil) is also pretty light-weight.  The big bad shows up to taunt you, throws some mooks at you, rinse and repeat.  The nature of the Wakeverse is such that ambiguity about what's going on is entirely appropriate, but in Nightmare the writers seemed to use it as an excuse to avoid writing.Buy Alan Wake, but you can readily give this one a pass.

												Didn't hate it as much as I thought I would. I still hate it though. The great atmosphere of the original game is almost completely gone. The only pluspoint of this game is that you have access to more weapons than you had in its predecessor.			",123,37,0,10,7,0,1

												A stand-alone expansion on the story of Alan Wake. Worth getting if you really enjoyed the original game and want to play some more flashlight shooting action. The storyline was a bit more lackluster than the original game but was still enjoyable and the characters are decently written. Graphics are a bit better than the original game but overall the game is much unchanged. That being said, if you enjoyed Alan Wake, you'll enjoy his American Nightmare.			",497,118,13,55,29,6,52

												This game is great and worth your money, even in 2016. It's a mystery-game, and it feels like an interactive movie. It plays in ARIZONA, you will see great landscapes and old western ghost towns. It sometimes feels like an episode of ""Ghost Adventures"" but even better cause you get to face and eliminate ghosts or shadow people... The Story-mode is a bit cheap, as in the middle of it... you get into a loop and have to play the same stuff over again with minor differences, that is the only thing that sucks. And there is an ARCADE-MODE where you fight the shadow people on places like a an old western cemetery, and old western ghost towns ---> THIS IS EXTREMLY COOL!

												Not going to lie, I havent even played the storyline part yet.  Mainly been enjoying the Arcade mode included  which is a blast.  Think kinda like resident evil's ""The Mercenaries"" mode with more of a suspense instead of gore theme. Arcade mode has good gameplay that keeps you on your toes.  You try to take out the shadowy figures that are coming after you all the while checking over your sholder for a knife that may come out of the dark to cut your throat.  Thats right... the ""taken"" intentionally distract, outmanuver, and flank you to land a killing blow. Made me jump more than once.			",113,4,1,4,7,0,9

												Amazing standalone DLC in the Alan Wake franchise and while it is not a true sequel it does tie up the Mr. Scratch/Dark Half plotline introduced near the end in the original Alan Wake. They now also introduce more weaponry and enemies which makes the combat more interesting and they have also improved the graphics. It's still a very narrative game with a great Stephen King-esque feel to it. It still feels as if you are walking around in a Stephen King horror novel. The protagonist and an outside person narrate the events happening in-game and this is a very interesting design choice and it appealed very much to me as it immersed me more and made the feeling as if you were playing a character in a horror novel even more apparent. If you liked the original I'm almost certain you will like this game as well, it's a great game to enjoy for the wait for Alan Wake 2 and it didn't divert much from the original story we just see a glimpse in the life of Alan after the 2 years he spent in the dark place.I give this game an 8/10 just because it has a great way to tell it's story, has beautifull aestethics, great graphics and a compelling story.

												Its sort of a little adjunct story to the main Alan Wake tale.  They fix some of the nagging combat issues from the main game with a hammer called uzi, and that can be kind of fun... but... its one of those tradeoffs where there may be plenty of survival, but is there really that much horror when you have assault rifles and mag fed 9mm pistols etc? There was something (albeit admittedly something frustrating) to be said for the tension of frantically hand loading individual revolver rounds as the shadows closed in on you.Where as the main game you slogged through the combat for the story, this almost takes the opposite approach... they spice up the combat but the story is a little less... riveting.  Its not terrible, its just not going to live up to the main game there.  All in all its a decent little diversion for Alan Wake fans, but I wouldn't chalk it up as a must play.(7/10)			",532,202,3,64,39,3,87

												I am not sure why the score on this game is so much lower than the original Alan Wake.  This is not a 50 or 60 dollar game like the first Alan Wake was,  so expecting it to live up to the first game is foolish.  You definitely get your moneys worth in this game. I personally used the -developermenu command to start my first play through on Nightmare.  Playing it on Nightmare the game still only took maybe 6 hours to complete, but it was a great 6 hours.  For the Price you can not go wrong. In this game Alan is caught in a time loop, where you have to complete the same set of objectives in the same environments 3 different times to ""get it right""  Perhaps this was one of the downsides of the game for some people,  I personally found it to be a fresh new approach , and really enjoyed it.  I give this a 9 out of 10 based on what it is,  it was never released as Alan Wake 2 and I feel like a lot of the lower reviews and scores were based on that idea, rather than this being a much more affordable addon adventure.

												I really liked the original Alan Wake, so this one was a real disappointment. The plot sucks like a gaping chest wound and makes no sense at all, the graphics aren't all that great, the script and voice acting aren't brilliant and Alan just really reminds me of Ray from ""Everyone Loves Raymond"". Its also far too easy and there's never a feeling of peril so its lost that survival horror edge of worrying if you're going to make it through. It just feels like a game written by someone who'd had the first game explained to them by someone who'd heard about it from someone else. I played through to the end to see whether it would redeem itself but alas no. The Arcade Survival mode is a nice distraction but ultimately its a bit of a dud. My score is a poor 5 out of 10			",105,40,0,14,8,2,25

There is no crosshair, I have to mention this, no crosshair. Wasting ammo becomes a normal thing even i used to snipe and burst shot every time.The world-The world is set in semi-open world for finding scripts but it's absolutely boringThrilling-This game is not scary at all!Pros-Nice and cool background, charactersArcade mode is really coolWell spent, my 3 dollars, well spent.

												American Nightmare provides players with a glimpse into the events that take place after the ending of the previous Alan Wake game. The storyline replaces the previous villain with a new ""Mr Scratch"" who acts as Alan's antagonist for the majority of the story. Combat is still as predictable/lackluster as it was in the previous game with an additional unnecessary enemy (spiders, really?) and a stoic AI that just attacks you without taunting phrases etc. Still, the overall story was interesting enough to keep me going through the game despite all its flaws, for what it's worth and the game is short enough that the more repetitive elements aren't overbearing.

												I liked the insight into Mr. Scratch but for the most part the story is extremely lacking compared to the first game, even if this is just a ""what if"" game. I was looking forward to the Arizona night atmosphere and using Night Springs to tell the story but even that was very lackluster and squandered potential. The whole game is just way too easy, you can refill all your batteries and ammo to maximum all the time and most of the unlockable weapons weren't worth exploring the area to find the pages to unlock them with in the first place.The first game suffered from being repetitive and what do they do this time? Make it even more repetitive by making you play the game three times. Combat is a little tighter thanks to having automatic weapons and limitless ammo strewn about all the time but that dissolves what little tension there is. As a big fan of the first game I can not recommend this to anyone, but rather just watch the cut scenes on youtube because the rest of the game is just shooting fish in a barrel with an assault rifle with a bottomless magazine.

												Pros: Arcade mode is fun - essentially ""survival mode"", fighting off wave after of wave of increasingly strong enemies. New weapons and enemies. Style is very different from original, adding variety. Story is a time-loop, which is fun and fits with the original. Gunplay is still fun.Cons: 3 hour campaign, with low replayability. Hasn't been upgraded much since the original. Plot is pretty pointless. Not as much fun as the equally ""not essential to play"" 2 chapters DLC for the original. Does not introduce newcomers to the concept. Taken as enemies, using flashlight with guns and light vs. dark theme makes little sense with the otherwise different style.My recommendation: Unless this is on sale with a lot of money to save, I'd skip it. Frankly, I'd say this should be free.			",64,2,0,0,0,0,1

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is the 2nd game in the Alan Wake franchise. Although it is a standalone product on Steam, it plays more like an expansion pack to Alan Wake than a direct sequel. The story is shorter and far less compelling, but the action, gameplay, and graphics are all beefed up a bit and actually a lot more fun than Alan Wake. The Good:* Low price tag, the game is $10 base and frequently goes for $5 during Steam sales.* Rather than walking down a hallway with the occasional monster (which is the original Alan Wake in a nutshell), American Nightmare features a more open-world. That being said, the game-world is incredibly small and features only three locales: a rest stop, an observatory, and drive-in theatre.The Bad:* The arcade mode, which is supposed to be one of the main draws of this game, is flat and not fun. It's very similar to Resident Evil's ""Mercenaries"" mode, where you simply run around and try to kill monsters in combos. However, Resident Evil somehow manages to be more fun and feel faster-paced.* Some art objects were taken directly from the original Alan Wake and stand out.The Ugly:* Being from Arizona, where the game is set, there were way too many noticeable errors. We don't have license plates on the front of our cars. There are Saguaro Cactuses in our deserts. There are not tall deciduous trees. I understand the location is a fictional town created in Alan's head, but I really don't care. I choose to be outraged!The Verdict:American Nightmare is short and sweet, and fixes almost everything that was wrong with the original Alan Wake. Since most people buy both games together, I kept this review short. However, if you have to pick one of the two, I would definitely tell you to get American Nightmare. Keep in mind, though, that American Nightmare does NOT compare to many other AAA shooter titles - it is fairly generic and won't offer you a revolutionary experience.			",224,72,4,40,33,2,60

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare can be considered a short sequel to the first Alan Wake game as it picks up directly after The Signal and The Writer episodes.In general, the shooting mechanics and movement feel more crisp and smooth, there is an expanded variety of weapons to use, although most of them function similarly. (Mainly being: High Damage Single Shot, Low Damage Machine Gun or High Damage Shotgun Shot)In the first game, Flashbangs and Flare Guns used to be the ultimate weapons as they can easily clear all enemies in an area. This is not the case in the sequel. They are only able to take out some weak enemies while their main function is to disable enemies and clear off the darkness.The story component is short, about 1/3 the length of the original Alan Wake.However, there is a Arcade mode which puts you in 5 distinct settings and challenges you to score as many points as possible through defeating enemies and maintaining your streak by avoiding damage.If you enjoyed Alan Wake, this sequel is great fun. Just take your time to explore the areas and listen to the dialogue for a more detailed understanding of Alan Wake's world.  If you did not enjoy Alan Wake, this sequel will not interest you much unless you would really love to try out the improved shooting mechanics and the new enemy types.If you are thinking about playing either, Alan Wake is a better introduction to the series.My review of Alan Wake can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenghuang/recommended/108710/ ",60,12,0,0,3,0,6

												In my opinion, the original game had one weak point. The gameplay. It was fine, but got extremely boring if you have to do it for more than 10 minutes without a break (whether the break be a cutscene or whatever) because in itself it's not rewarding at all to kill these dark zombies.Now American Nightmare makes it so that there's much less story and more gameplay. The little story this game has is extremely boring and dull, so that got completely trashed. Remains the gameplay, which is still the same unrewarding and monotone shadow killing. You can see where this goes. American Nightmare is awful, end of story.			",176,49,2,12,9,0,8

												The first game in this series was atmospheric, could make you think, make you laugh, and could at times be genuinely scary. With a grade A soundtrack which used actual artists and made its own music, you had a solid game. Was it perfect? No, certain graphics were a little wonky and there was pretty bad product placement, but it was a game I’d suggest to friends and people who enjoyed the genre of adventure/horror. The sequel on the other hand took all that was good and sort of tosses it away. Making it more of a battle game than anything else. If you're looking for that, you'll be fine.

												A dull, repetitive and easy game. I beat it on the hardest difficulty and it never was a challenge.The game itself abuses of repeating the same exact three situations during the entire nightmare (calling this ""an enjoyable experience"" would be a lie). I literally wanted it to end.Nonetheless, the arcade mode results interesting, but it's not enough.I guess it's not a bad game, but you won't miss anything if you don't play it. Only for Alan Wake's fans. Music is great though, Old Gods of Asgard keep rocking it!Just don't forget to turn on every single TV you find. Watching Mr. Scratch's madness is probably the best part of the game.			",244,52,10,26,12,1,15

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It has all the mechanics of the original ""Alan Wake"" game, but without its biggest flaw: its constant shortage of ammunition. It's a more arcade-y game, to be sure, and, if that's not your thing, pass on this, but for those of who enjoy a quick romp through the Alan Wake universe with no shortage of ammunition to mow through its darkness minions, this is one to collect.Note that it's only 2.5 hours in length, so judge whether or not it's worth waiting to buy at a discount or not.

												Horrible, boring storyline. There's only three maps in the main story, but they make you replay the story three times with the lame cop-out of a time issue.Survival mode makes this game slightly worth buying, but doing well in it requres playing the story and finding the collectibles.

												The real nightmare for Alan Wake lies in his inability to escape the same three map areas that are re-hashed time and again in this 'expansion'. Prepare to let Alan and his rugged lumberjack shirt be torn asunder by the three varieties of shadowy enemies that are on offer as you grow oh so tired of repeating the same actions over and over and over and over. A cycular excersise in tedium that provides little of the spooky charm on offer in the original game.			",334,81,5,39,18,5,50

												Ok where, to even begin.As a huge fan of the alan wake series, I personally thought Alan wake American Nightmare was Alan Wake 2 (but that was false)Alan Wake American Nightmare (is a stand alone game that just adds to the series)Personally this game should have just been a DLC because its not really all that great.The Arcade mode is pretty fun to play and seriously addicting, but the singleplayer lacks story.Literally all you do in the single player is, finish an objective (time resets itself), finish the same objective (time resets itself again) finish the same objective and a side objective this time. You get the point.But I did get the chance ot playing this game with the Oculus Rift, and I have to say it was one of the most fun Oculus Rift games I've played.

												So, Alan Wake returns to fight his evil twin who is trying to block out the sun and take over Alan Wake's life....sounds about right. So I knew going into this that it was going to be a short experience since it is not a sequel but instead a little side story. Knowing this still didn't prepare me for this watered down version of the original game, the story is pretty straight forward with very little room for exploration, characters are for the most part uninteresting with nothing really important to contribute to the story or experience (almost robotic at times), and the repeating of the same 3 levels 3 times was getting me to the point of not wanting to finish the game. Ok so it may seem that I am coming right out the gate with all the negatives but I did enoy this game and I'm going to justify it. Even though you repeat the same 3 levels 3 times over, which at first disappointed me, but near the end I felt they handled it the best they could, with each time you play that level it was a different experience because the characters sort of knew what was going on and helped speed the process of completing the level. Everytime you went back they completed some of the tasks that you had to complete yourself the time before. The graphics are beautiful just like in the original but this time it didn't have as many post card type scenes to look at. Gameplay and combat are the same from the original with Alan Wake not being the most agile guy in video games but it felt right for the context of the Alan Wake universe. Manuscripts this time around serve more of a unlock system rather than just a piece of additional pieces of information about the story, if you collect enough manuscripts you can open weapon boxes that are laid out around the environment which give you more powerful guns to help you proceed a little faster through that game (ex. SMG's, Assualt Rifles, and Hunting Rifles). They also added a few more enemy types that are very welcomed, nothing worse than fighting the same enemies over and over again. Aside from the story mode, they have Arcade Mode, this is like a horde mode that you defeat the Taken until the sun comes up (10 minutes), it was fun but I do feel like it was a missed opportunity for co-op or multiplayer, which it weird because usually I'm the one that doesn't want multiplayer in story driven games like Assassin's Creed and Mass Effect. But in this case it would've been nice, especially since you only play it to get the highest score on the leaderboards.That's pretty much it without spoiling the game, I do recommend it for people who like Alan Wake or for people who never played it before, it is a good game with a couple disappointments here and there but nonetheless a great game to play for a few hours.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is strange in that it straddles the line between traditional DLC and a stand-alone game. While it's not a direct continuation of the original's story, fans of the first game may find some value in reading through as many manuscript pages as possible, though the lack of any real answers may also be frustrating. On the flip side, those new to the franchise might feel lost, thanks to the surprising absence of any backstory or exposition. Still, as was the case with the first game, Alan Wake's American Nightmare manages to overcome some glaring issues, thanks to its strong writing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A somewhat fun spin-off game that is somewhat connected to the first game. While the original game was strong in it's story and atmosphere, this one is more cozy and laid back with a bit of a confusing story. Also with an introduction of new enemies and weapons was a bit interesting.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!-----------------------------------------------Here is what i liked about the game:- Manuscripts you can pickup in the game- Controls are the same as in the first game- Can sprint much longer- New Arcade mode (Boring because there is no coop)As in the first game, there is manuscripts you can pick up. I think it adds some insight to what is actually happening here. Controls are exactly the same besides the fact that you can run for much longer in this game, in the original you barely started running before you ran out of energy.. I like that they tried to add a new game mode, but it falls short because it's not really fun.. You just have to survive for 10 minutes in some random location while dealing with ghostmen.. it's hard, but it's boring. I wish they would have implemented multiplayer on that part.-----------------------------------------------Now here is what i didn't like about the game:- Confusing story?- Automatic weapons- Different ghostmen, but you ahve to deal with them the same way- A little too cozy/They removed the atmosphere effectsI don't really know how to feel about the story, it's confusing and  you have to run through the same areas 3 times.. that's right.. 3 times. I kind of got the story once i was done with story mode. And seriously, i think the automatic weapons made the game way too easy. They kind of removed the charm of the game itself. Also, if you played the original.. you know how to deal with these guys. There is one exception.. there is the splitter who splits into 2 if you point your flashlight at him, but the fun in that weared out in 10 minutes. Also, the game really feels cozy since they decided to remove the creepy effect you experienced in the first game. Especially in the woods.. ugh.-----------------------------------------------The Verdict:A little too cozy, a little too easy, kind of confusing story and the same gameplay as in the original game. It falls short compared the the original game and quickly becomes boring and linear. Arcade mode is boring. Ending was kind of expected. It had a few moments, but that's it. If you must get it, i would recommend getting it on sale since the 4 hours of gameplay is linear and repetitive as ****.Not recommended.			",107,5,3,14,4,0,16

												American Nightmare is an interesting addition to a superb third-person shooter. The location now is Arizona; instead of dark woods you now have desert-like areas and the game focuses on a very arcade-like shooting experience.Beside the plot - which is the continuation of the original - you have stages you can play separately and as there are leaderboards you can replay them for higher score.I recommend this expansion pack but only if it's on sale, otherwise it's just too short and isn't worth the money. While the arcade like features are nice I missed the long and interesting story that characterised the vanilla game. For me American Nightmare was fun but a bit of a let down after the core game and its DLCs.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												As Alien is more of a horror to Aliens and how that is more action focused is the difference between this one and the previous game. It's not a fear-filled game and certainly doesn't build up atmostphere like the last one as you are thrust into the action, however that doesn't mean it's bad. The story is very good and it gives a happy ending to it too.The improvements I like is that you have a mini map to tell you where the manuscripts are, making the achievement to get them all insultingly easy, which is a good thing in my opinion.Also, collecting the manuscripts gives you an advantage. The more you collect the more weapons you can unlock which can help cut the enemies down. Free tip, Crossbow is the best damn weapon. It destroys the darkness surrounding the Taken and for most Taken it's a one-hit kill.The creatures in this are a lot more creative. You have some that don't have protection, but instead split and these creepy spider-like creatures. Clearly here the people were being more creative with the monsters and it's very well recieved and Mr. Scratch makes a very good villain. If you liked the first game, you'll love this one too, but it is more action based than storline I'm afraid, as you can tell from the many achievements revolving around the arcade mode.

												Well, I liked the first Alan Wake a lot, and I waited something along the same line for this second game. But, in short:Cons:-The atmosphere from the first game is gone. Now the genre is more to adventure than horror;-Repetitive gameplay;-It feels like the whole game is about the arcade mode;-The history is not good;-It feels like the developers (and by this I mean the whole team) got lazy and just came up with a history that could use the same scenario many times, so they didn`t have to develop too much scenarios;-Not much entertaining;-Invisible walls (I'm putting this item here mainly because it was one of the things I praised on the first title);Pros:-The graphics, the videos and the voice acting are all well made.

												This was a decent sequel to the really great original Alan Wake game. However, this game was fairly short in compares (finished with all non-arcade achievements in 6 hours, while the original took me 35?). It was much easier overall, and only had a few locations. This could have very well been simply another DLC for the main game. Unsure why they bothered making this a stand alone. Because clearly if you did not play the original, you would be almost entirely lost on the whole story.The thing I did not care for, is they threw in this 'Arcade Mode' thing as like some sort of last ditch effort to make it worth a stand alone price. It serves no purpose, is extremely boring, and well... wasn't needed.Overall, if you can grab this on sale, its worth it if you liked the original Alan Wake game. If you never played the original game... do not bother with this as you will be lost, and left with a empty feeling and buyers remorse.			",116,22,2,5,8,0,9

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is an interesting title. A psuedo-sequel/spin-off/expansion to the psychological thriller ""Alan Wake,"" American Nightmare is both familiar and different from it's parent. It's familiar in the sense that the core of the gameplay remains the same: you still use light to burn away protective darkness to make enemies vulnerable. Light is your ally, your friend. What's changed however, is the setting, your abilities, and the nature of the areas you'll traverse.American Nightmare is set in the American Southwest—Arizona, to be exact—outside a fictional city known as Night Springs. Unlike Alan Wake, which presented the player with mostly clear point A-to-B setpieces, American Nightmare follows a more open route. Although each of the areas you'll explore isn't exactly large (the developers are clearly feeling the crunch of being restricted by XBA's size limit), you're free to roam them as you please while you accomplish your objectives, and it's usually in your best interest to do so—provided occasional darkness attacks don't prove to muc for you.Fortuitously, however, Alan Wake is no longer the out-of-shape writer with a limited weapon selection he was before. In American Nightmare, he's changed himself to a more contemporary action-hero, with far more agility and skill than last we saw him. You'll find your arsenal expanded as well: sawn-off shotguns, Uzi's, Magnums, crossbows, even nail guns ... All will be needed. It's not an awe-inspiring set, but as you make your way through the game unlocking new weapons on the way to the final showdown, you'll definitely find some favorites.The story is short (and involves a time loop, to save space once again) so you'll get used to seeing the same scenes in the basic game. Fortunately, there's more to American Nightmare.Those weapons you unlock in the main game (via finding manuscript pages)? Once you've unlocked them, you can find them in Alan Wake's other mode: Arcade. Here you're tasked with lasting ten minutes on one of several maps, using whatever you can scrounge from nearby. The generic maps aren't too challenging, but once you've beaten a few, you'll unlock a new mode that ramps the difficulty up to eleven and probably past that becomes quite intense. Trying to use your flares and flashlight to hold the horde of enemies back while frantically reloading is a blast.From the standpoint of a newcomer, this title could be hit or miss. I recommend it, but Alan Wake seems to be a polarizing cup of tea for many. If you're a fan of action-survival modes (CoD Zombies, Gears Horde, Resident Evil Mercenaries) than American Nightmare is worth grabbing for the Arcade alone. Otherwise, I'd recommend watching a few videos first and seeing if the gameplay style appeals to you. For me, it does.Pros:—Clever enemy design—Unique Light-based combat—Exhilrating Arcade mode—Excellent soundtrack courtest of ""Old Gods of Asgard"" (AKA Poets of the Fall)—Genuine psychotically eerie villain, even if he is a hamCons:—Repetitive Environments—Limited types of enemies, even if they are clever—A little too much focus on conventional weapons over the light based ones—I did miss the more powerful flashlights from the original title.Recommendation: Buy it if you're a fan of the genre or a fan of Alan Wake, watch first otherwise. Definitely fun though.			",110,10,3,8,6,1,41

												Great Game but somewhat plagued by repetitiveness. This makes sense when considering the story line of the game but regardless it still could have benifited by more variation within missions rather than just increasing the difficulty.Arcade Mode adds replay value with a twist!Yes this is a much shorter game than the original, but then the price is cheaper than the original Alan Wake so that makes sense.

												American Nightmare is an interesting addition to a superb third-person shooter. The location now is Arizona; instead of dark woods you now have desert-like areas and the game focuses on a very arcade-like shooting experience.Beside the plot - which is the continuation of the original - you have stages you can play separately and as there are leaderboards you can replay them for higher score.I recommend this expansion pack but only if it's on sale, otherwise it's just too short and isn't worth the money. While the arcade like features are nice I missed the long and interesting story that characterised the vanilla game. For me American Nightmare was fun but a bit of a let down after the core game and its DLCs.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Building upon the foundations of the original Alan Wake; American Nightmare removes you from the shady forests and logtree cabins of Bright Falls and places you somewhere in dusty Arizona on the hunt for your evil doppleganger 'Mr.Scratch'. Alan Wake's American Nightmare gets things right as much as it does wrong with regards to gameplay; finally you are moved to an open world area to explore at your leisure, places to see and weapons to unlock via acquisition of manuscript pages; its a disappointment that the missions themselves aren't quite so enthralling as you'll find yourself running back and forth through recycled set pieces that subtract from an otherwise enjoyable story experience.

												Pretty good followup to Alan Wake. I finished it with all the collectables within 6 hours, but enjoyed all of it. The game retains the same combat mechanics as the first title, and throws in a few new refreshing additions, such as new weapons, new enemies, and a different style of boss fights. Just like the first game, the storytelling is strong. This time, live action is used more heavily. All the cutscenes are done surprisingly well in live action, and there are a lot more ingame tv bits of Alan talking crazy. The cutscenes and Alan's dialogue/manuscript readings are great to listen to. The game is much shorter this time around with only three levels, which cleverly repeat themselves over the course of 3 Acts. There is also an Arcade mode apart form the main Story mode. It resembles a typical survival mode of some zombie killing game. You can avoid it.Overall, another good game by Remedy. It's a nice short extension to the Alan Wake storyline if you feel you need more of it after beating the first.			",632,132,18,87,35,3,106

												The American nightmare picks up a couple of years after the events of the first game. Alan is still trapped in limbo - in the dark place, but evidently some parts of his mind attempt to escape the hold of the darkness. When he was first touched by darkness he spawned Mr. Scratch - an evil but charismatic,enigmatic as well as a ""better"" version of himself as Mr. Scratch himself put it.Mr. Scratch is trying to get out into the world and replace Wake who is thought dead by everyone except Barry. Wake finds himself in Arizona where weird phenomena keeps happening. He finds himself in a horror episode created by Mr. Scratch. ok, no more spoilers but there are a couple of twists in the story, and then there are more...twists..again and again....There are only three more characters in the game so it feels pretty desolate. Pretty soon the game turns into an arcade shoot. The ammo is plentiful (there are actually ammo and supply respawns throughout the game), the open-worldliness of the first map kinda takes away the feeling of accomplishment. You keep looking for the pages of the manuscript that Wake keeps writing in the dark place and use it to unlock better weapons as well as knowledge about what to do next.There are about 5 new enemies. There are spiders, there are those who can split into multiple versions of themselves, those who can stand 9 feet tall and wild large chain saws, those who turn into birds and those who can throw stink bombs, I guess.What's interesting is how you are able to pick up on the events of the world through radio shows and disturbing camcorder videos done by Mr. Scratch which were an absolute blast to watch and there are plenty of them. They used plenty of live video here which is unheard of in 99% of games. I also particularly enjoyed the determinism vs. free will arguments between Wake and the astronomer as well as on the radio. Wake basically argued that the absence of free will is irrelevant given the fact that the character knows nothing about the next set of set deterministic events.In any case the atmosphere is there, but it also feels kind of cheap, the desert is just too boring. I also found myself disinterested for the first couple of hours but then I kept playing and kept getting sucked in. It took me about 5.5 hours to finish the game. The game also does a pretty good job of explaining why the first game looked [played] like a TV show or a drama/thriller movie. Wake explains that he is able to fight the Taken effectively (and dodge attacks) because that was a small semi-realistic kernel of the main protagonist that helps propel the story forward. So many more things can make sense now for those who didn't really get the original game.There is also a survival mode. You are given 10 minutes to fight off the taken at various locations until the sunrise. It can be fun but I doubt you will be playing it more than a few times. I put the game into the hard category because there are a few frustrating spots in the game (especially the last 20 minutes) but you do feel pretty good when you survive multiple attacks with the last few bullets.All in all. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first game.			",373,36,1,24,8,2,38

												Thankfully I bought this at a discount. The story is ok, the graphics are excellent and the gameplay is, once again, repetitive. I actually enjoyed it a bit more than the original Alan Wake, maybe because it's a whole lot shorter (about 2 hours) and I don't think it's a game that should be played in longer sessions anyway (that's right, because of the repetitiveness). If you can get it cheap, go for it (it's standalone so you don't need the original game).[Rating: 77/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Remember when music used to come in EPs (in-between LP [full album] and single)? With gameplay focused more on combat than survival horror, American Nightmare is pretty much that - an EP. If you ever seen Stargate SG-1's classic episode ""Window of Opportunity"" then, you will understand what the story of this game is all about.Only, not as funny...			",105,23,1,7,4,1,7

												It would be hard for me to talk about American Nightmare without touching on the original Alan Wake, because it very much feels like DLC that got spun into its own game. Alan Wake's strengths were its story, pacing, and graphics. The combat was a bit of a toss-up between decent and monotonous, depending on who you asked. American Nightmare is a shorter, weirder story told across three mostly open areas that you visit multiple times. The visuals are still sharp, but lose a lot of the atmosphere that Alan Wake had... the open desert just doesn't have the same creep factor as the dark woods, at least not as it's shown here. Dialogue is pretty snappy and clever, but it's propping up a story that really adds nothing to the themes introduced in Alan Wake.So the main draw is the combat, and to its credit, it's a little more interesting than in Alan Wake. Enemy encounters are varied in makeup, and there are some new foes like ones that split if you shine light on them and creepy jumping spider things. All the original weapons are here, along with new additions like a nailgun, uzi, and carbine. You can unlock weapon cases with additional weapons by finding manuscript pages scattered around which encourages exploration, but honestly as large as the areas are, there's not much to find. Enemies only appear as you follow the main plot, and the game showers you with ammo and flare, more than enough to handle any situation. I tried playing on the harder of the two difficulties and the battles were still a breeze with all the resources I had, but I could be killed in just two hits which led to some frustration with unlucky hits at the ends of long fights.There's an arcade mode similar to the mercenaries modes in Resident Evil that's pretty fun, assuming you like the combat. And that's really what American Nightmare boils down to, did you like the combat in Alan Wake? If so, this is for you, but don't come looking for the atmosphere or story of the original.

When the game is so boring that you literally take 4 years to give it a second try just to close it after 15 minutes and uninstall for good.Alan Wake's American Nightmare should receive an ""at least you tried"" award to compensate its budget loss. I mean, the graphics and animations look nice and appealing, except for a main character who looks like a single dad. Then there's this dull storyline with sh*tty dialogue and a hasty pacing, which I've heard loops later on and forces you to repeat some parts.

												Loved Alan Wake, but this expansion/sequel is bad.  They turned the game into an action shooter.  You run around levels killing the same enemies over and over and over.  The story and characters you meet are mostly forgetable, as are the set pieces.  You are never in any danger, as you will never run out of ammo since they have multiple infinite ammo spots on each level.  You play through 3 levels, and then you play through those same 3 levels again, and then you play through those same 3 levels again before the game finally ends.  Hope you enjoy those 3 levels, because you get to see a lot of them.  There are very few new or interesting enemies and by the end of the game you'll be tired of killing them over and over again, especially since they pose almost no threat to you.  Do yourself a favor and never play this garbage.			",177,73,1,18,19,1,19

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare follows the adventures of Alan Wake as he attempts to chase down and thwart the schemes of his mysterious double by rewriting reality. As interesting as this may sound, the premise is ultimately let down by shallow combat and uninspired environments. In a story which seems so incredibly bizarre at first glance, it is a shame that the game which surrounds it is so average.Alan Wake's American Nightmare markets itself as a third person horror game, but fails to differentiate its self from other games in its genre. It's combat, While not bad, will seem very familiar to anyone who has spent any amount of time playing similar games. Ammo is plentiful and combat is relatively easy as a result. Most of the weapons available feel familiar as well, with basic pistols, rifles and shotguns making up the bulk of your arsenal. Only the occasional power tool manages to change up the stagnant weapon variety, but such weapons are too few and far between. Another minor way in which Alan Wake's American Nightmare tries to differentiate itself from its peers is through its use of the flashlight. Before an enemy will be vulnerable to attacks, they must be exposed to light for a period of time, either with a flashlight or other means. This creates some welcome tension, as the player tries to juggle foes with their flashlight, all while watching their batteries slowly drain. Unfortunately, doing so can become cumbersome in later sections of the game as the quantity of enemies being thrown at the player increases.I was also alarmed to discover that despite Alan Wake's American Nightmare's short length, it still managed to recycle most of it's environments multiple times. I don't believe that recycling environments is always a bad thing as long as they are sufficiently altered to create new and unique game-play experiences, but in this case I just felt as though the recycled spaces were their to serve as padding.While by no means a terrible game, Alan Wake's American Nightmare feels far too familiar. Throughout the experience I couldn't help but feel that my time would be better spent elsewhere. For people who are interested it may still be worth giving a shot, but don't expect anything amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had some really good ideas. A flashlight that recharges faster, and more streamlined weapons, ammo and dodge mechanics. However, the problem with the game is that it recycles the same some 3-4 stages over and over and over again. Once you think you beat the Arizona areas, the game puts you right back at the beginning of stage one all over again saying that something else has happened there. This is a cheap way to increase game time and easily becomes boring as very few to no new elements get introduced after this point, you are literally put in a loop. It might be that this is the game's vision but this pretentious ideology only saves the creators the time of actually creating more good ideas and locations that would make the story actually interesting.  I lament this fact because the game has really good functionality that is better in the first game, but throws it all away by literally reusing the same locations over and over and over again. DO NOT buy this game, instead, if you haven't already buy the first Alan Wake game instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nothing like the original. American Nightmare is a silly parody of the American horrors and the original Alan Wake, unfortunately it fails at being funny. It's not scary either, and the action elements get repetitive very quickly due to lack of story. Play the original Alan Wake, skip this one.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												Apart from an excellent tongue-in-cheek hommage to classic B-movies, this is an all-out *brilliant* chapter in the Alan Wake saga. Forget what you may have read about ""arcade mode"". The story is every bit as satisfying and head-spinning as anything in the main game.Think of this as Special Episode 3. And what an episode it is!			",370,224,5,52,18,4,32

												""Just go get that battery.""I wasn't impressed by Alan Wake and decided to give this one a chance. But AW: American Nightmare doesn't deserve a chance. It's utterly unscary just like it's predecessor. Story is not engaging, chars aren't interesting, goals are boring... You just restart another generator and than another enemy wave comes at your a.s.s. The only good thing about this game is gunplay - flashlight+weapons technique works nicely. But it's not enough to make it a worthwhile experience. Leave it be - the game is a nightmare.			",302,82,13,36,15,6,34

												Offering a quite different vibe as the original game, American Nightmare is more of a fun romp as you jump between locations attempting to fight the darkness. It was obviously designed and written with the intentions of seeming like an X-Files or Twin Peaks episode. Jumping between the locations ends up feeling lazy from a game design perspective as the locations were the real star in the original game. The combat of course tires quickly, especially to those who played Alan Wake.			",119,50,1,16,14,2,11

												I only suggest that you buy this game if you get it 80% off in a bundle with the first one. Or if you already have beaten the first one and want more story explained (but even then, its not worth 10 bucks!!) And btw i didnt even bother playing the Arcade part of the game, this is just a review of the capaign portion.Here are the problems that i have with this game:- The suspence/horror aspect that we all loved from Alan Wake is completely gone. Think of the progression from Dead Space 1 to Dead Space 3, except Dead Space 3 made up for it cuz it was far more epic. This game is more tailored to an action adventure, and it hardly feels like Alan Wake anymore- This game supplies you with the closest thing to unlimited ammo i have ever seen. Its absolutely ridiculous. Dont even bother conserving ammo and batteries because you will NEVER run out. The result of this ammo surplus makes the game completely unintimidating.- The man who played Alan Wakes Doppelganger persona was a TERRIBLE ACTOR. It might not bother you, but i wanted to gouge my eyes out when you tune into his monologues on the TVs because of how god awful his attempt to be insane and evil was.- THE REPETITION. Its so incredibly repetative that i have no desire to focus 70% of the time playing.- Throughout the game there are a total of 3 moments when there would be ""battle music"" of some kind to add to the ""epicness"" of the situation and 2 out of 3 of the songs were terrible. One was some extremely cheesy 1980's heavy metal track with bad vocals and terribly guitar solos and the other was just stupid (""IM A PSYCHO BABY, I TOLD YOU IM A PSYCHOOO""). Again, it may not bother you too much, but i couldnt stand it.HOWEVER! Here are some reasons you SHOULD play this game:- The story holds some unanswered questions about what happens after Alan Wake at the end of the first one, and about his wife and whatnot- The combat was smoother, and the addition of new types of enemies was very refreshingOVERALL, if you loved the first one, and this one is cheap, just get it, beat it and uninstall. Its worth the experience and storyline explaination but other than that it doesnt even compare to the original.			",177,23,7,36,14,2,6

Short version: 31%Alan Wake’s American Nightmare takes the best parts of the original game (the atmosphere, the setting, the mystery, and the cast) and throws it out completely; then takes the worst part of it (the combat mechanics, which are only enjoyable against a small group of enemies) and builds a whole game around it. The end product is a shallow, outrageous mockery of the original game, which may only be enjoyable for those who like the simplest B-grade shooter titles, or just thought that Alan Wake wasn’t like Max Payne enough.Long version:If Alan Wake was the video game equivalent of a large-budget mystery thriller miniseries that aired on prime time, then Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is like as if Syfy made the second season.The original game featured a highly detailed and lush environments and led you through several unique and enjoyable levels. This one has three painfully empty maps with a few objects scattered here and there and buildings crammed together with little coherence. And the maps are recycled three times in the so-called “story” with the exact same objectives, but with some new type of enemies.You can also forget the memorable supporting cast, here you have the most clichéd evil twin of the protagonist and three female supports, who are so bland and void of all character traits that you will most likely forget their names by the time you see the level end screen.In some manner this is all explained in the intro and in the (horribly banal) narrative: the whole story is supposed to be taken as some low-budget late-night horror show with all the bad things it comes with. But the problem is: they nailed it too perfectly. It is boring and uninteresting, and in all the wrong ways.And this leads us to the worst part of the game: it’s nothing, but a huge shooter. The weak story and the non-existent characters are only cardboard decoration to the never-ending shooting. The combat focus becomes even more painfully obvious when you see the Arcade mode in the main menu, which is exactly what it sounds like: you get dropped in an arena and must kill the never-ending wave of enemies.The only problem is: the mechanic is the same. You still have to shine light on them for several seconds to make them vulnerable, and you still can’t shoot while doing it. So each fight is nothing but a big chase around the empty maps: you try to dissolve shields while dozens of baddies are trying to get you. Sounds fun? Probably not, because it isn’t. Just avoid it and act like Alan Wake’s story ended with the last chapter of the original game.			",78,261,0,12,9,2,21

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is one of the most atmospheric and immersive video games I've ever played. The story is a dark, twisted, sinister-like fantasy all wrapped up in a strong narrative by yours truly, The Champion of Light, Alan Wake.To tell you a little bit about the developer, Remedy, they brought us the classic video games like Max Payne 1 and 2. Inventive storytelling, with a dark tonality. Alan Wake's American Nightmare might not pose any scares like the original Alan Wake, but it's such a well-polished PC port that I can't help but acknowledge Remedy for doing such a wonderful job. The graphics feature high-resolution, and high-res textures, making the Xbox 360 version pale in comparison. I remember vividly playing the original Alan Wake on the Xbox 360 and the difference is like night and day. Although, I have no regrets about buying the original Alan Wake on the Xbox 360 because it went towards supporting such a great developer, and now we have American Nightmare. The visuals are clean and crisp. I think I took over 100 screenshots in my first 2-3 hours of gameplay. I couldn't help but stop to look at the surroundings and environments. The lighting and shadows are incredible. It's a beautiful game.Excellent story, narrative, atmosphere, immersion, and being one of the top 10 best PC-ported video games on the planet, American Nightmare stretches to a 6-7 hour standalone game for a mere price of $5-10 on a good sale. It's totally worth that much and more. Despite these bright features, American Nightmare is flawed by being too easy on the difficulty side. The game loses all tension on Normal mode, and it is best played on Nightmare mode instead. On Normal mode, there are ample ammo and weapons throughout the environments and fighting enemies is way too simplified and easy. Enemies do not even get close to you with the high amount of arsenal and flares at your disposal. But if you're just looking for an atmospheric experience without the challenge, then Normal mode is perfectly suitable for a playthrough.If you thoroughly enjoyed the original Alan Wake, and you want more of pursue more of the atmospheric-story-driven game, look no further. Turn the lights off, put on your headphones, and drift away into the darkness.Rating: 8 out of 10			",96,21,1,10,1,0,4

It is a arcade shooter with little emphasis on the story, the single player is short and repetitive. Literally. You have to repeat the game 3 times in order to see the credits.Why am I recommending it? Because I had a blast playing the arcade mode. This is where the game shines.

I stuck with it hope against hope that it would improve and the ONLY moment it did was at the end, in the final cutscene. This is like a pitiful echo of the first game. I love alan wake, & his story, & I adore the manuscript pages but it was an everlooping circle of repetition, explaining all the things that occured in the last game.

												If you were like me and enjoyed the first iteration of this game then don't make my mistake and purchase Alan Wake's American Nightmare. It lacks the deep atmosphere and outstanding narration of it's predecessor and is instead replaced with cheap writing and repetitive gameplay. ...And by repetitive I mean you literally play the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ campaign 3 times. If you are even still interested let me spare you the time and money and explain everything. There are 3 (very small) maps, which you to 3 tasks on each, which feature 3 different plot-driving broads, and the same 3 enemies throughout the whole game (normals, Hydra-like freaks, and heavies).Voices aren't synced to lips, it isn't uncommon to see Alan spaz out on certain terrains, and the story trys so hard to be cryptic and suspenseful its almost heartbreaking. It really is a disapointment and it obviously shows that this game was a quick cash grab at those who enjoyed the first.3/10 - Certainly will never play again however the game was a nightmare			",59,8,2,5,8,0,1

Not once was I wearing a trenchcoat or shopping on IKEA dot com. I did get to shoot spooky ghostmen.

												As a writer, I consider the first Alan Wake a great game for its metalinguistic. The story within the story, the topic of what makes a writer a writer, the symbolism of the dark force as the market and the stupid corporate suits who twist and turn the will of an artist to make raw money... The fact that the story unfolded in two fronts (the game and the pages you collected) was specially fascinating.As a gamer, the first Alan wake was interesting, nothing special beyond the light mechanic but fun on its own way, I ended up annoyed because even in the nightmare, the enemies were merely annoying and there was too much ammo (and with my hoarder mentality from games like Resident Evil and Dead Space, I ended having lots of moments where I left crates of ammo behind because I was full).But this... unfortunately... feels like a shoddy and lazy filler. There is no story, it's just Alan hunting his doppleganger that it's in his place because story reasons that aren't really explained, the same places are used over and over and over. The city that the developers made with care to look alive and real is replaced by three patches of boring desert with three female characters that are awfully and lazily voiced. The combat has been dumbed down (amazingly), even if there are more guns for you to use, you can only carry two: A main arm, and a sidearm.""But sir! Alan Wake was supposed to be realistic! The devs said so! You don't see a guy carrying fifteen weapons on his pockets!"" Yeah, the devs also said that this game is more action-packed and inspired in americana action series. It's specially grieving since now ammo is universal. Black and red boxes will fill ammo for your side arm, and orange boxes will give ammo for your main weapon. Regardless if you're using an uzi, a nail gun, a rifle or a shotgun. It mostly boils to the fact that they wanted to port it from the consoles to the computers as fast as they could and couldn't be bothered with changing.And to make things 'worse', the 'realistic' excuse can't be used anymore, since Alan now fights weird enemies that turn into birds or that split in half when shown bright light. While in the first game the dark presence merely took possession of people and objects, now it... mutates them? It gives an excuse that since the antagonist is different, it does different stuff but... again, within the own meta-linguistic, the story gives no reason WHY the antagonist could do it.Speaking of meta-linguistic, all the pages that explained what happened to npcs and about the story that is unfolding were, again, severely dumbed down. With only three girls to talk to and three scenarios, and with most of the surprises being gone, most pages are just filler, annoying filler, needless filler.While I didn't had high expectations about this game (with the company acknowledging that they wanted their time to make Alan Wake 2 and didn't wanted to rush things) I at least expected that they would do an enjoyable work, like the DLCs from the first game.The only way I could reccomend this game is if you liked the combat mechanics from the first Alan Wake and wanted to play a dumbed down, arcade version of it.

												This game is awful. It completely removes all aspects of horror which were barely even in the first game for a pure shooting action game which forces you to play the same damn maps three times. The first game was way better but I cant even recommend it because this one wraps everything up at the end with a terrible ending as well. Terrible dlc decent first game would not recommend for horror fans.			",112,9,0,13,3,0,18

												American Nightmare represents an epilogue to the main Alan Wake game, and as such it would be best to complete that story first.  Alan finds himself ""stuck"" in a new reality taunted by his evil doppleganger, whom he must eventually destroy to escape back to his wife in the ""normal"" world... where 2 years have passed and everyone believes Alan dead.  Again-another great idea, but the execution feels quite tedious.  The world is more open now and there is a map to guide you to your objectives.  the action mechanic of stunning and shooting the Taken is still present, although ammo and weapons are plentiful... I did not die once during the game on Normal.  There are manuscript pages, TVs, and radio shows to absorb if you have the patience to do so.  What killed it for me was the fact that you complete the same 3 maps and objectives 3 times!!  Granted, each time the tasks are attenuated a bit, but there is nothing new to discover with subsequent iterations.  Bargain bin please.			",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone. It is entirely based around three areas; A motel, A drive in theater, and an observatory. You go through these three places, but then become stuck in a time loop. So you need to go through these three places.. again. You then attempt to rewrite time again, but don't do it right, and end up stuck in the time loop.. again. So you go through these 3 areas.. again and rewrite time.. again. Game over. No dramatic ending, no big fight scene. Nothing. A total of 5 hours played which realistically only two hours of content. It's not all negative though. The music was cool....			",222,46,5,34,19,2,39

												Awful sequel to an incredible game. This is everything that Alan Wake is not. Bad storyline, absurdly repetitive scenarios (you will literally replay the game three times under the diguise of a ""time loop""). While combat is improved over the original (a major complaint), everything else about this pseudo-sequel simply pales in comparison to the original Alan Wake. Took me 2 hours to beat.

												Okay, okay. The reason I do not recommend this is because, well, it's almost nothing like the first game. A huge dissapointment to me. So, if you like the way they made the first game, DO NOT buy this. If you didn't care for the first one. This is a completely different kind of game, so you could try it. It's a decent game. If it didn't have ""Alan Wake"" in the title, I could have probably tollerated it because, like I said before, It's practically nothing like the original. More weapons, more enemies and the campaign is the same thing 3 times over. Not too apealing to me. If you love monotony, I highly recommend this game to you.P.S. I have more than ""0 hours"" steam acts weird with Alan wake games on my computer.			",308,56,2,23,25,2,10

The arcade mode is fun as well, except for those grenade tossers that ruin your combo. I got the game when it was bundled and on sale so it didn’t feel like a rip off.

												If I was enthusiastic about Alan Wake, the second opus American Nightmare is a major disappointment. First of all, the game is mostly a shooter. You basically start with some arsenal, and get more powerful weapon as you go. Plus, there are boxes with ammuntion that auto-refills, thus loosing the pressure of  trying to get out the shooting as much as you can. Alan Wake turned badass is a bad idea.Second, the game features only 3 maps, with the same characters and the same puzzles that you will play to death thanks to a time loop. Yep. The first time when you go back at your starting point, you ask yourself what you did wrong. Then the second time, you feel the game is just playing with you nerves and just want to finish it as soon as possible and forget it.Really, Alan Wake's American Nightmare should be played only to see how an otherwise great licence can crash and burn due to unwise design choice.

												First off, let me just say this: This game has no effect on the Alan Wake universe.  All the game reveals is that Mr. Scratch is a bad guy.Now, onto the review.This game fleshes out new ideas in case Alan Wake 2 would come out.  For example, there are some new monsters such as a spider-parasite thing, a monster that morphs into two when light is shined on it, one guy who can change from ravens to a man, and finally a guy who throws dark grenades at you.There are also some new weapons, such as the nailgun, the machine guns, and probably some other stuff I don't remember.For 15$, this game is not worth buying.  The story mode is unique at first, but then it gets repetitive.  In short, this game makes you repeat the exact same story three times in a row before you beat it.  Yup, that's right.  You do the same things thrice, and then you beat the story mode.  If you want to buy this game for the story mode, pass on it.The reason anyone would want to buy this game is for the arcade mode.  It is a 10-minute fight with waves of Taken.  This is unusually easy in this version because the weapons are so much more powerful and because the flashlight recharges almost instantly, rendering batteries near useless.TL;DRDon't buy it if you are looking for a good story.  Buy it on sale for the arcade if that's what you want to play.			",231,51,8,20,20,5,34

It still a fantastic experience like the first Alan Wake, if you liked the previous game i'm sure you will find it interesting and worth playing it.Something that really loved about this was the Realtime cutscenes, god i hope they do the same with Alan Wake 2, and please i want more of The Old Gods Of Asgard.Not so wonderful or epic as AW but well worth the money and a must buy..My Rating: 8.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Presenting itself as an episode of a Twilight Zone-esque television show called ""Night Springs,"" complete with a Rod Serling soundalike narrator, Alan Wake's American Nightmare sees the titular hero facing off against an evil manifestation of himself, called Mr. Scratch. Scratch has taken up residence in a small Arizona town, and has turned most of the population into zombie-like hostiles called ""the taken."" Much of Alan Wake's American Nightmare's gameplay involves dealing with the taken, who attack Wake at regular intervals. The taken are usually protected by a cloak of shadows, which must be ""burned"" away using Wake's flashlight beam before he can then employ firearms to permanently put them on the other side of the dirt. Dodging enemy melee attacks is a heavily emphasized element of the gameplay: successfully doing it both slows down time and lets Wake get some distance from bad guys.			",323,80,6,63,25,1,33

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a disappointing spin-off title that feels more like a new episode for the original game than a proper sequel. At least the engine has been upgraded and the controls and visuals are certainly better. This is a good thing too, since American Nightmare is a much more action-oriented game.Unfortunately in most other ways American Nightmare is an inferior product. It does not have any of the original's atmosphere or tension, the story is rather messy and the game is also quite short. Additionally, there's only three small maps and they are all revisited during the campaign.It's not a bad game as such, just rather disappointing after the strong original game. Only recommended for big fans of the original or during a sale.The good:- Nice visuals- Improved controls- Several new enemy typesThe bad:- Weak story- Rather short- Lacks the atmosphere of the original- Only three small maps that are all revisited several times- Poorly written side characters who don't really seem to fit in Alan Wake's world- Ammo refills are everywhere and there's no challenge anymore on normal			",564,232,11,89,49,8,102

												If I was enthusiastic about Alan Wake, the second opus American Nightmare is a major disappointment. First of all, the game is mostly a shooter. You basically start with some arsenal, and get more powerful weapon as you go. Plus, there are boxes with ammuntion that auto-refills, thus loosing the pressure of  trying to get out the shooting as much as you can. Alan Wake turned badass is a bad idea.Second, the game features only 3 maps, with the same characters and the same puzzles that you will play to death thanks to a time loop. Yep. The first time when you go back at your starting point, you ask yourself what you did wrong. Then the second time, you feel the game is just playing with you nerves and just want to finish it as soon as possible and forget it.Really, Alan Wake's American Nightmare should be played only to see how an otherwise great licence can crash and burn due to unwise design choice.

												Great little spin off and continuation of the story of Alan Wake, with a short 4-5 story mode (with some repetition and back racking in the levels but it's intergral to the story) and a horde-esque survival mode where you try to survive till dawn and top the leaderboards. Great quality stuff for what was essentially an XBLA title. Not as good as the original AAA title but anyone expecting a cut price downloadable title to be is dilusional. 7.5/10			",287,38,7,10,9,2,16

												As far as games go, this one is satisfying enough to play if you're interested in only the game mechanics. The guns feel varied and responsive, it's challenging, and a solid enough shooter. Where this game lacks, is story. It truly feels incomplete, the characters are all cardboard, unappealing representations of women (BOOOORIIIING), to the point where how terrible they are is almost offensive. Unlike with Alan Wake, there's no sense of accomplishment from beating this game. While Alan Wake didn't have what I'd call a true boss battle to begin with, there was a definite endurance run that had some challenge to it. Alan Wake's American Nightmare is repetitive, uninteresting, unsatisfying, and as far as a story or complete game feeling, a total let down. It does not live up to the bar set by its predecessor. A fun shooter, lacking the substance and character of the first game. It's like I could see where there was SUPPOSED to be a game, but they didn't quite make it there or finish it. So... Meh?

Game flows a bit slow but the pace gives you a constant feeling of unlease (but in a good way, as if something is just about to happen to you...all the time).Game is short (about 4h to beat) but those who complain about it need to understand that this was never meant to be a full lenght game. This is an episode. Just long enough to leave you wondering ""what the hell just happened"". In the style of (and most definitely inspired by)  the Twighlight Zone.			",110,11,5,7,12,2,24

												So I'll keep this simple and short. This game costs less than the original Alan Wake. The reason for this is that Alan Wake was a full game and this one, Alan Wake: The American Nightmare, was an Xbox Live Arcade game. That being said, if you heard of this game somewhere, or want to give it a try just go and play the first one for two simple reasons. 1) Alan Wake: The American Nightmare is a sequel. 2) Original Alan Wake is much better in every way.I'll keep this short. If you play The American Nightmare first, you won't like Alan Wake and miss all the answers for ""What, who, where, how and why"". Alan Wake is a great game, however this sequel was made purely to create a game where you could fully experience the unique Alan Wake combat mechanic. Alan Wake: The American Nightmare is short, less of a horror, more of a shooter than the original one. However, it's a good sequel in regards of ""STORY"". Alan Wake fans should play this game as it's not a spin off or side story but a straight out sequel.			",85,11,3,4,2,0,5

												I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone. It is entirely based around three areas; A motel, A drive in theater, and an observatory. You go through these three places, but then become stuck in a time loop. So you need to go through these three places.. again. You then attempt to rewrite time again, but don't do it right, and end up stuck in the time loop.. again. So you go through these 3 areas.. again and rewrite time.. again. Game over. No dramatic ending, no big fight scene. Nothing. A total of 5 hours played which realistically only two hours of content. It's not all negative though. The music was cool....			",222,46,5,34,19,2,39

So, if you like the way they made the first game, DO NOT buy this. If you didn't care for the first one. This is a completely different kind of game, so you could try it. It's a decent game. If it didn't have ""Alan Wake"" in the title, I could have probably tollerated it because, like I said before, It's practically nothing like the original. More weapons, more enemies and the campaign is the same thing 3 times over. Not too apealing to me. If you love monotony, I highly recommend this game to you.P.S. I have more than ""0 hours"" steam acts weird with Alan wake games on my computer.			",308,56,2,23,25,2,10

												Awful sequel to an incredible game. This is everything that Alan Wake is not. Bad storyline, absurdly repetitive scenarios (you will literally replay the game three times under the diguise of a ""time loop""). While combat is improved over the original (a major complaint), everything else about this pseudo-sequel simply pales in comparison to the original Alan Wake. Took me 2 hours to beat.

												It's more Alan Wake. If you liked Alan Wake, play this. If you didn't, don't play this game. Me, I do recommend this game, but only if you played the original Alan Wake (on Steam, GoG.com, XBox 360). I think the original is the superior game, but this is not bad in the least. The reason for that is because you already experienced it with Alan Wake, and there's not much new here.Think of Alan Wake as Half-Life 2, and Alan Wake's American Nightmare as Half-Life 2: Episode 1. It's more of the same; just as fantastic as the first game, but not much added. I mean, they don't really need to add anything to the game, but it's nothing earth shattering like the first game.

Still got all the same features of the main game, the use of light to save yourself and destroy enemies, you need to get batteries to power your torch and destroy the dark demons that are hunting you.Tl;dr, fun game like the main game, worth a try!

												Alan Wake was a fantastic game which kinda wrote itself into a loophole in which a sequel would be pretty much impossible.  SO, here's the sequel!  And aside from its use of the Majora's Mask reliving the three days mechanic, it's still a garbage game with three maps, a laughably easy and predictable story, female characters who inexplicably are interested in nothing but sex with Alan (I mean, I get it, he's famous. but come on play hard to get) and worse graphics than the game which it is the SEQUEL of!!!

												If you've just finished Alan Wake, this should be your next stop. AWAN gives you the chance to leave the series with a smile on your face. Far more colourful and weird than Alan Wake itself, Alan is trapped in an episode of Night Springs that he wrote whilst Mr Scratch goes on a murder spree wearing Alan's face.If you enjoyed Alan Wake, you must play this game. If you didn't play Alan Wake, this will be totally indecipherable.			",618,250,12,89,58,5,107

												Unforgetable atmosphere in the style of the 60's Americana. Game flows a bit slow but the pace gives you a constant feeling of unlease (but in a good way, as if something is just about to happen to you...all the time).Game is short (about 4h to beat) but those who complain about it need to understand that this was never meant to be a full lenght game. This is an episode. Just long enough to leave you wondering ""what the hell just happened"". In the style of (and most definitely inspired by)  the Twighlight Zone.			",110,11,5,7,12,2,24

												A follow up to Alan Wake and sort of decent. Long story short, I can slightly recommend this more than I can't. The gameplay and storytelling is roughly the same but the story is short overall. The time loop story element makes you run through areas you have already visited for the sake of the story and will feel extremely repetitive. The scare factor from the first Alan Wake is almost non-existent here as the game seems to be much more focused on shooting rather than scaring. Even with all those negative elements in mind, the game is still an enjoyable experience although it's very short.			",178,20,0,20,11,0,20

												This game is decent but nothing I myself would rave about. I played the first Alan Wake and remember they combat and weapons and story. This game is good with graphics and is a solid familiar feel to the old version but certainly isn't as pleasing. This game features more weapons which i believe is one of the greatest downfalls of the game. I mean the reward of collecting pages for a better weapon is okay but i believe could of been integrated in a different way.  This game was way to easy to complete and the mechanics babied you too much the entire time. On my first playthrough i beat the game in 3.5 hours and collected 40 out of the 53 pages. The mini map even had minor indicators for the pages you search for; which tells me that the pages truely aren't hidden. Your suppose to work for the pages not be lead to them. With this said the unlockable weapons will range from a scale of VERY underpowered or SUPER overpowered. To me the characters are crap for realism. Alan wake is a Writer not a soldier and somehow he knows how to perfectly use an assault rifle? The character even admits it himself in the first game he never used a gun for a long period of time if at all. The mechanics of the revolvers, shotguns and a bolt action rifle are easy to learn by looking at them. But military grade weapons are much to complex to use like a pro the first shot. With this said your magical ability to use each weapon like a master and reload them withen seconds is what makes the game far too easy. The story was meh but good if you get it on sale for a time killer. i paid 99cents .  I say content was extremely lacking and this game feels more like a special dlc for the game.  I say this game is worth one playthrough if your a fan of Alan wake but other then that this game is definitely not worth full price. wait for a holiday sale . With all this said i must add that the first game had a stronger feel of lonely helplessness while here you feel like your able to fully help yourself with no big issue. but would i reccomend this that would be a no.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is essentially an all action (similar to Resident Evil) 'sort-of' continuation of the original Alan Wake storyline. It follows the ""stuck in nightmare world"" idea, and most of your time is spent blasting away enemies in (the same) three stages. Repeat that three times and that's all there is to American Nightmare. Not much.American Nightmare completely lacks the psychological aspect of 'psychological thriller,' that the original Alan Wake was barely able to pull off (similar to Silent Hill). Besides sharing the same name, the two titles have little in common. American Nightmare is simply Alan Wake, reduced to a basic shoot-em-up arcade style games with little-to-no story set in three repeated stages.Also worth mentioning is that if you're looking for some resolution to the ending of the original Alan Wake, you won't find it here.

												I am an absolutely massive fan of Alan Wake; it's one of my favourite games of all time, I've finished it countless times on the Xbox 360, and I have a blast every time I play it. With that said, I found this standalone sequel to be rather disappointing in comparison to the brilliant first game; bear in mind that I do not think this is a bad game, it just falls rather falt and disappoints after the first game.Alan Wake's American Nightmare is intended to play out as an episode of the fictional TV show called Night Springs, and is narrated by Lloyd Floyd, who provides an interesting narration to the story.The game has Alan Wake trapped in a sparse desert area, and who must find a way to escape the recurring nightmare he is stuck in.And that leads to my first problem with the game; because Alan is stuck in a nightmare which repeats itself, you are forced to endure the same hour of gameplay THREE TIMES in a row until you finish this game. The exact same missions and locations, repeated three times. The first time is fun, the second time is kinda uninteresting, and the third time is downright boring and repetitive. This is a lazy way to repeat locations in a game, and it also reflects the poor writing skill of the writers. The story is rather weird and disjointed. Throughout the entire game, you do a lot of things for unexplained reasons which aren't apparrently clear when you do them or even at the end of the game. The whole story is weird and quirky, but not in a good way, as it barely makes sense. The characters, apart from Alan and the absolutely BRILLIANT Mr Scratch, are boring and are just as quirky as the story itself. However, I found the live action cut scenes rather good, which was a surprise for me.The gameplay is exactly the same as the first game, except that you can use new weapons like sub machine guns and nail guns. That's it. Zero changes made to the gameplay.There's also a survival mode, which is actually quite fun. It's intense, challenging, and a fun way to compete on the leaderboards with your friends. I found this mode better than the campaign to be honest.Overall, this is certainly not a bad game; it merely fails to innovate, and doesn't capture me the way the first game did. I still love Alan Wake, but this game disappointed me quite a bit. If you don't mind an extremely repetitive story, even with the game's shining parts, then pick t up for $3 on sale. 6 / 10.

I feel like this game does not respect the player's time, and I could not bring myself to finish the last act because of this. Good mechanics and gameplay, but doesn't hold interest.Edit: I went ahead and finished out the last act. I will say that this was the most enjoyable act of the game, but doesn't change my overall opinion on the game.			",154,22,1,5,6,0,6

												The story was mediocre if not bad in content and the way it was told. Puzzles/investigation were awful considering all you had to do was to follow a star on the map and press B once you reached that point. I loved the original Alan Wake, and though I understand this is not a sequel but rather a spin off, I can't find a good reason to recommend this game to anyone. It was a waste of time.

												Uhh, this has no place in the Alan Wake Storyline. There's no place to put this. Plus, Alan is way too calm about this ""darkness monsters are trying to bash in my face"" thing. What's with the darkness monsters, anyway? Didn't we do away with them when we crippled the Dark Presence?- An Alan Wake Shoot em' up. No.- Alan is really strong, and the weapons are ridiculously overpowered.- Story is two seconds long.- Story literally loops back onto itself three times.- Ooh, I'm your evil darkness doppelganger!- Enemies are cartoonish, not remotely scary.- Wait, this is ""Return""? Oh, lawd, please no.+ Story doesn't feel too much like it's repeating itself.+ Thank Jeebus there's a minimap on this one.+ Fewer collectible item sets. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really just awful.  The fact that this game has 'mostly positive' reviews really illustrates just how braindead your average person is.First off, I actually kinda enjoyed Alan Wake.  It wasn't great by any stretch, but, whatever it had enough going on for me to finish the game which in itself says something.  But holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ American Nightmare?  What a complete bore.  First off, the entire game is revisiting three setpieces over and over again.  There is zero challenge, thanks to the fact that all the ammo/weapons you could ever need are literally chucked all over the place so you don't even have to worry about being accurate when you mow through Taken.  The story is ridiculous and makes zero sense, and the voice acting is either mediocre or god-awful depending on who you're interacting with.Took me 3 hours to get through, didn't die once, and had exactly zero fun the entire time.  Avoid like the plague.			",245,44,0,38,17,2,28

												not much to say here... If you enjoyed the other, glorious, alan wake game, chances are that you're going to mildly enjoy this one as well. The story itself is somewhat connected to previous installment, but it gets pretty repetitive, even if the game can be completed in less than 4 hours. I won't spoil the game telling you the reasons for this, but if you're going to play it you'll see. New weapons are somewhat interesting, graphics are well done, as was the case the the first game, even though the locations are nowhere near as spectacular. All things considered, you should probably give it a try if it's on sale and you really loved the first game, otherwise you may want to reconsider buying it.			",46,4,0,12,2,0,10

												Alan Wake:American Nightmare is a spin-off to original game.You play as Alan Wake who is a writer and you must fight your way through darkness using light and firearms. While it’s not a direct sequel to previous game it still has same mechanics. But this time Remedy added more weapons making game more intense. While the main story is only 4 hours long it lacks good plot, and memorable characters. You just simply travel to 3 “Areas” 3 times and fight dark creatures to find some special objects to complete your mission in exact area. The atmosphere is great. It has gloomy backgrounds of Arizona which makes it look cool. Very awesome soundtrack to listen. You can also search for hidden manuscripts scattered all over the world which can be read later. They can give you some information about the lore of Alan Wake franchise. Finally new addition to game is Arcade mode. It’s basically “Horde Mode” just to kill waves of enemies till the dawn across 5 different maps.7/10			",365,12,2,16,14,1,17

												Wonder what the characters from Alan Wake were doing after the original game? American Nightmare lightly touches on this, adding more live-action footage and amazing visual effects. However, this time you are suck in a repetitive ""Groundhog Day"" situation. I found this to be a very annoying way to copy-and-paste the game's three levels several times, creating a very cheap experience that does not do the original game justice.			",168,58,2,14,8,3,18

												A brilliant stand-alone experience/ dlc. Prepare to face off against the ultimate american nightmare with a flashlight and a couple of bullets. Drastically more action packed than Alan Wake, this game generously provides you with an upgrade in firepower. Assault rifles, pump action shotguns, uzi machine pistols, all at your disposal to use however you like. You are also provided with flares and flash-bangs for when things get a little TOO tight. Your evil doppelganger is spreading mayhem and havoc all over Night Springs, Arizona and considering you well y'know, look like him, it is your job to stop him and clean up the mess. Catch number 22 however is that he has his own personal army of darkness out to get you (What did you think all the awesome weapons were for?). My motto for this game is stay in the light and you'll be all right.			",152,26,1,5,8,1,6

												This is a different Alan Wake, and not for the better.  It's cheesier (the narration resembles the narration in the Night Springs TV show from the first game), shorter, and more focused on combat (to the extent that there's even an arcade mode).  The biggest strike against it, though, is that the story mode only features three areas of moderate size, each of which must be played through three times because Alan is stuck in a time loop - which may make sense in the context of the story, but it makes the game somewhat repetitive.It's not a terrible game, but it doesn't add much to the original, and it was disappointing enough that I'd recommend passing on it.

												Doesn't add anything to the story and is extremely repetitive - more than the main game, which is a performance somehow! - as not only it's still a matter of killing waves of enemies in the open, but it's also going back in time and redoing the same actions over and over again. First one had a potentially rich story. This one has nothing for it. It really feels it's just a botched game, surfing on the Alan Wake franchise potential hype in attempt to make easy money by creating a coupe of levels you just do and redo again. Such a shame from Remedy, killing their reputation like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although I payed $.39 for this game, I'm going to complain about it anyway. As a disclaimer, if you are planning on buying this game because you enjoyed Alan Wake, don't buy it. I bought this game thinking that, like Alan Wake, it would be an exhilarating horror game combined with the elements of a third person shooter. However, this ""sequel"" seemed more like a dlc which had the horror elements  of Michael Bay buying the franchise. Although there are some horror elements, the idea of this game being scary is a joke. The mediocre story take about 5 good hours to complete which then leaves you to♥♥♥♥♥♥around on the arcade mode until you finally realize that you are wating your time. The story is nothing special, in which finding all the collectibles was more fun than the actual game itself.  Although settings-wise it lived up to the original, the horror elements of batteries and ammo being limited was replaced with a more shoot-em-up element. Overall, this game disappointed me as it was only a game that I would play if it was the only one in my library.			",38,7,0,3,1,0,0

I'm pretty certain from playing the first game, and experiencing 35 minutes of this one, that I know what I'm in for. No thanks.

												I actually liked this more than the regular campaign. This is kind of like a mix between the main campaign and a really basic open-world game. It's a lot more open than the main campaign, but it's still rather linear, in that there is only ever one objective that can be done at a time, but you can roam around and explore. The areas aren't very big, and you can't freely travel between them, but this kind of gives me a taste of what the main campaign could have been like if it were designed as an open world game instead of being as utterly claustrophobic as it was.This standalone DLC made quite a few changes from the original game, but not all of them were good. In the original Alan Wake, there were 4 weapons. In this one, there are 2 pistols, 2 rifles, 3 shotguns, 2 automatic weapons, a flaregun, and a nailgun. While choice is always good, some of the weapons are insanely overpowered, and some are just pointless. It seems like the developers took people's complaints about the main game's combat system to mean that combat was too difficult (it wasn't), and made it easier. Unfortunately, that means combat is now a cakewalk. Ammo is RIDICULOUSLY plentiful, weapons are insanely powerful, and enemies will barely ever even get close enough to hit you. Throughout the whole game, I got hit maybe 4 times, used 1 handheld flare, never fired the flaregun, and totally forgot I even HAD flashbangs.They beefed up the flashlight as well. The enemies seem like they take less light to burn away the darkness, and the flashlight recharges CRAZY fast. From completely empty, it will charge to full in about 3 seconds, including the 1-2 second delay before it even starts charging. I was playing on Normal (there's only normal and nightmare), too, but maybe in this game that's the equivalent of easy.The story is still rather interesting in this expansion, but the writing and voice acting are HORRIBLE. I mean absurdly stupid at times. I'm all for campy fun, but sometimes it gets so ridiculous that it really pulls you out of the experience. Speaking of acting, the little ""TV"" segments where your dark self talks to you go on WAY too long sometimes, and don't really play any importance in how the game unfolds (and you don't get any achievements for them or anything).Overall I liked this. The story and acting took a step backwards from the main game, but you're not confined to the stupid outdoor tunnel sections (running through the woods), and combat doesn't get in your way as horrifically as it did in the main game either.It's rather short, so don't pay $20 for it or anything, but I enjoyed it. Your results may vary, of course.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Uninspired, lazily repetitive, and down-right droll.This game is nothing like it's predecessor Alan Wake, and can definitely be skipped without guilt.Not only does the game botch the modest challenge/enjoyment to be had from Alan Wake's gameplay, it completely screws the pooch on storyline: a single episode of Night Springs from the original game has more narrative intrigue than this entire game of Night Springs.Pass.

												Well... It's worth the money in a sale for a quick play but honestly... This game has nothing on the original game.  Very quickly it stands out that the main game mechanic which made this series unique has been tampered with and spoiled... The mechanic I am talking about is light.  Light is the key to defeating the darkness, and no idea lightbulbs went off in the developers heads that made this.The First game had little weapons, and had multiple flashlight types, beyond your regular flashlight you could find a heavy duty flashlight and two lantern type lights that in a world of combating darkness was amazing... this game replaces atmosphere and light combat with dumbed down boring gun fighting, many weapons are now available such as an Uzi and M16 and to be blunt... they just dont fit.  The normal light from the flashlight no longer burns away dark... it simply does nothing, you must focus the flashlight to make it do anything... mostly it's just a case of focus light, spray uzi or M16 and repeat now this... is the ultimate sin... They basicly ruined the main combat mechanic that made this game special and replaced it with bland generic shooting.There are only three areas in this game, and those get reused several times as a time loop plot device... the ever repeating events become dull and the newer enemys just don't make it interesting enough to make it enjoyable...  infact the other characters remembering the previous loops ahve having previous tasks already finished only highlights the boredom the developers must have realised would happen playing the same content over and over again.The first game was dark... VERY dark and the dark fog and shimmering enemys gave me goose bumps... this game did nothing to make me feel dark was dangerous or intimidating, there was no eerie fog everywhere and no sense of dread that made you wish for teh next brightly lit area to come soon... the game just wasn't creapy, spooky, or scary... it just didn't do a good job at all.The sandbox arcade mode where you fight till dawn is a fun addition, and it is fun to try and beat your friends scores and try to survive for the full 10 minutes untill dawn... actually that is almost the only time this game seems to remember that light is your ally...So as I mentioned...   The game is worth a play as a sale price... it's just nowhere near as good as the first game.			",121,4,1,6,11,2,17

												Improves a bit on Alan Wake. Gameplay is a bit smoother and a bit more fun now, and areas are a lot less lineair which benefits the gameplay. Yet the core remains the same: aim your flashlight at an enemy for a few seconds and then shoot him until he drops.The game is graphically stunning though and has high production values: it contains licensed music and even live action sequences.I wasn't able to finish the game due to boredom, the improvement in gameplay just isn't enough. It's enjoyable to wander about in the game for fifteen minutes or so though, before shutting it down again.6,5/10			",376,82,13,39,35,5,60

												I only understood the real meaning of Alan Wake`s American Nightmare when I was about an hour in the story. This must be a parody of Alan Wake. There cant be any other conclusion than this easy one. I mean everything, really everything what made Alan Wake a frightening and exciting experience was canceled in this game and replaced by an action based ""horror"" shooter. I mean Alan with a M16 Fire Rifle? Really?? Dont get me wrong. You will get fun for a few hours. But is this worth the money? That is a question only you can answer to yourself. For me it was since I got this in a damn cheap Alan Wake bundle.However the pros and cons.Pros:-Funny Shooting-The evil Alan Wake in his Lifeaction videos was cool.Cons:-Same location three times (it is the story but it gets boring)-Far to easy on normal difficulty (play as nightmare)-Story mode is about 2 hours long-TERRIBLE Voice Acting-Extremly terrible dialogs. The narrator tries so hard to be all that dark and have a meaning full text but a powerful text does not always start with just a noun - a pause - and subsequent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t text. ""The observatory."" ""The village"", ""A Man and a Woman-"" herp derpI think this game would be much better if they did not try to give it a horror shooter ala Alan Wake atmospheric style. It would be far cooler as a only shooter focused crazy shooter where tons and tons of monster are thrown in your way with hardcore music in the backround. In one minute of the game it has this feeling and it was awesome. I found this YT clip which shows what I mean ""/watch?v=dJeDyw2C2h8"". If this game was a little bit longer and full of this moments I would recommend it for the money. But as it is now. Not for 9€, not even for 4.50€ with 50% off.I hope you liked this review and you are a little bit clearer about this game. ",152,33,5,11,16,2,8

												HOUR COUNT: >20 on Xbox 360, 1.5 on PCTL;DR: A nice little Xbox Live Arcade game, but not quite as good as the original game.  Also, it's a little short.  Arcade mode can add a lot of replayability.  If you're not sure, just pick it up on sale, preferrably as the Alan Wake Franchise so you can get the amazing first title.--Do I recommend it?  Only if you liked the first, or want the arcade mode.  Still rocking those fight-with-light mechanics, still fighting them darkness zambies, just more of the same-- which, trust me, isn't a bad thing!  It's a four to six hour standalone DLC campaign taking place after the events of the first game, and possibly the closest we'll ever get to a sequel (since Remedy's in deep♥♥♥♥♥♥and leaning on the success of Quantum Break).I went ahead and took the game for a spin in arcade mode, and the port is excellent.  Easy 60 FPS with very few dips to 48 while maxed out at 1360x768, R9 280 and Pentium E6600 with 4GB of RAM.  32-bit users welcome.  Much less CPU-intensive than the original game, and much more optimized for 60 FPS.  Vsync can cause a few strange issues with mouse sensitivity, though.The DLC campaign has about two hours of fresh new levels, then goes back to repeat itself three times.  Don't worry; you only cross over some of the centerpieces of each level, and you keep getting exposed to new parts of the levels you haven't visited before.  It's definitely a good campaign, and while it isn't on par with the original (as very few games are), it'll keep you playing for the duration.Mechanically, it's good ol' Alan Wake.  The only change is that you can't just aim at them to burn their shields away.  This time, you HAVE to be boosting your flashlight (right-click) to wear down their shields... which makes combat a little more tense, since your magical shieldbreaker now has limited ammunition.  The dodging mechanic also seems to be a little more responsive, and enemies don't throw♥♥♥♥♥♥at you nearly as much.Arcade mode was done well, though it could be better.  You start with a 9mm and flashlight, you have an ammo box that comes back every three minutes, a few lights to replenish your health, and you've got 10 minutes until sunrise.  There's also weapons around the map, and a few weapon cases that can only be opened if you collected x number of manuscript pages during the campaign.  You get tons of enemies thrown at you with several variations, and you need to get the highest score you can by avoiding damage and taking out enemies.  Get a high enough rating, and you can unlock the next mission.  There's 5 or 6 stages, and a Nightmare variation (more enemies, constant spawning instead of wave-based) for each.Is it worth $15?  Yes, but it's not the best game out there.  My recommendation's to save up and buy the Alan Wake Franchise bundle, so you can get both titles.  If in doubt, wait for a Steam sale.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												This game is the follow-on from ""Alan Wake"".  If you liked Alan Wake, I'm sure you'll like this one... it's basically a slightly lighter version of the first game.  Still dark, but with some laughs.Once you finish the first game, the beginning of this one makes perfect sense.  If you haven't finished the first one.... this one can seem pretty strange.The setting is very different from AW but is still decent and works with the story.The sound and music are still very good.The characters seem far more nonchalant about things in this game.  I didn't care so much for the characterization, really.  It was ok, but felt contrived.... which I suppose actually makes a fair amount of sense given the story, but I digress.In addition to the setting and Alan's clothing, the combat changes a bit in this game.  I found combat on Normal to be incredibly easy.  I wish I'd gone with Nightmare mode instead of Normal.			",73,8,0,10,6,0,30

												I came to Alan Wake's American Nightmare with high expectations after playing the first one and I must say, I'm disapointed. The story doesn't have the same immersion as the first game and it feels too much ""arcadie"". The game's atmosphere is not as good as the first game also but the weapon variety and the combat were improved alot in my opinion. It may offer you a few hours of fun but if you are looking for another game like Alan Wake this is the wrong place to look for in my honest opinion.			",1396,387,26,190,117,15,203

												I have no idea why Remedy Entertainment decided to mock their own game, but it can still be fun to play. Just not if you play it for more than an hour or two. It has a wierd.. comepletely different style of gameplay than the original and a strange ""arcade"" feel to it that just doesn't fit in the game at all and it's quite awkward. I suppose I'm bashing it a lot, but they just took a game that I loved for it's in-depth and strong story, and then sort of made a joke of it.

												OK. This is a cheap version of Alan Wake in every sense. Really really short. Very few locations and less developed in terms of atmosphere, character and plot. It is cheap. Its short enough to be a DLC but sold on it own which is niether good nor bad in my opinion.For me, while it was worth the low price, it was very unsatisfying as it was over in one gaming session and didnt last a full evenings gaming but balancing it out, it was nice to see Alan and his world again, even such a very very small part of it. Personally, I dont like these shortened low price games so having bought this one I wouldnt buy another follow up like this but nor does it put me off buying another full Alan Wake game either. I like the first very much indeed. Slightly disappointing even for the low price			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												American Nightmare is much smaller than the original, I played the whole story-mode within 6 hours. There was many things that made me laugh but the core of the story was a bit thin. As it makes player go through same scenes three times it could have been more like an DLC with price of 4-8e. The other game mode Arcade is quite fun and brings to mind distantly Remedy's previous series Max Payne. Storytelling isn't as good as in the previous one. New weapons are nice addition, I hoped there would have been more off them. [5/10]			",186,51,9,24,12,2,57

												They took one of the best things about the first game, the combat, and jacked it up big time and made it the main focus of this game. The first game you mainly did combat with lighter weapons like a pistol, pump shotgun, single shot hunting rifle, and flare gun. You also did a lot more walking around. Here, it's less walking around and almost purely combat. You get more enemies poured on you and you get a arsenal of guns right out of a action game, like assault rifles, nail gun, uzi, and whatever else. PC Gamer says it's not as good as the first game. PC Gamer also gave Duke Nukem Forever a score of 80/100 when everyone knows it should've been 80/1000 lol.It's a really fun game with a great unique combat system. Where the first game was heavy on story, this just gets to what made that game so great and expands on it big time: the combat. And the story is cool too. Not as good as the story from the first game but still good. Game is a blast, 7.5/10.- - - Fact of the day: Hillbillies like working on cars. YEEEHAWWW!!!!			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Аркада. Вот просто аркада. От Алана тут только сам Алан.Сюжетная часть игры представляет из себя День сурка. Три раза вам надо проделать практически одни и теже действия. Но это не дают ничего нового в плане сюжета основной игры (хотя, да, авторы и не собирались нам ничего нового показывать).А так, игра представляет собой испытания по выживанию: различные по времени, сложности, количеству оружия и т.д.Может кому-то пригодиться ) ",34,42,2,1,0,0,3

												Yeah, it's not bad. Not really a stand-alone title or sequel. More like a glorified DLC. Fun, but not very challenging. And it's more of a shooter than horror than the original Alan Wake, although even then calling the first AW a horror is a bit loose.			",114,17,0,9,19,0,21

												I love the first Alan Wake, but American Nightmare is such a lazy cash grab. Yes, my 3,2 hours on record are after I beat the game with some exploration. You essentially play the same few levels 3 times to even get to that much playtime. Don't waste your money on this, only play Alan Wake.			",169,16,9,8,13,3,14

												This game had me on the fance of recommending and not recommending.The game is only 2.3gb which tells me that this is a short game (but i have been wrong before so i've played it)The Game only has Three levels, that are repeated three times for the story (though each time you revisit the level, the goal is quicker to get to and new enemies to fight).The story takes place after the first game Alan Wake. stuck in the darkness fighting Mr. Scartch, his double gangger. who been busy in the real world while keeping Alan Wake in limbo.The gameplay is still the same as the first game, but without the ""staying in the dark too long well bring out enemies to ambush you"" part that got annoying in the first game when trying to scanning the level for collectables. as for what may cause me to be on the fences. The story isnt as good as the first game and honestly with the revisting levels. just get boring real quick. if it wasnt for my inposive nature to get all the collectables in one playthrough wasnt  getting in the way, my game play hours would be real short im only recommending this game if you want to something to play quick or wanting to complete your alan wake collection (as of now there is only two)			",129,12,3,15,6,1,2

												I would recommend this game for sure. Although I feel like this sequel is a bit rushed compared to it's previous title. I would like it if they made a 3rd game, but longer and nothing where you go in circles, literally. It took me 8 hours or so to finish the game on Nightmare mode, it was interesting for a plot, like watching a LOOONG episode of Night Spring tv. Which is the point, its Alan's nightmare brought to life. Pros:+ I get to shoot shadowy psycho killers again and NOT feel bad about it, unlike in the previous game+ Live action sequences of Alan+ Great Music+ Interesting story plotCons:-- No Big Heavy Duty Flash Light ;_; <-- That was a double negative- Weapon Damage feels different from previous game (When I use a flare gun, that's my last option thing to use, but it got weaker in this sequel.. :/ )- The grass looks like a higher definition version from MineCraft (I mean its a + if you're into that thing, sure)- Game is too short, wished for more... GIVE ME MORE! D<  Overall, if you want to know what happened to Alan after playing 'Alan Wake', sure go ahead and buy this game. But if you want it to be as awesome as the Alan Wake game, then you might get disappointed with this sequel. Either way, I just want to know what happens next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												개인적으로는 비추천합니다. 게임 진행하는 동안 등장하는 지역은 단 3개뿐이구요. 스토리 상 그 지역을 반드시 3번씩 돌아야 합니다. 원고도 매 주차 다른 것들이 놓이구요 그것들을 모아야 새로운 무기를 언락할 수 있는 방식입니다. 유저가 원하지 않는 강제적인 루프플레이를 강요하는 게임은 처음이었습니다.하하하하  물론 2주차 플레이부터는 조연들이 알아서 노가다할  건덕지들을 줄여주긴 하지만 그래도 왠지 지겹게 느껴집니다. 스토리는 결말까지 가는 과정은 다  좋았는데 마지막 앨런과 앨리스의 씬에서 심형래 감독의 디워의 배우들이 연기하는 것 같은 느낌이었습니다.

												Isn't it just the worst when you expect a game to be good and it isn't?The original Alan Wake was a game centered on the titular suspense/horror author, as he fought againt the forces of darkness in a sleepy little mountain town, saving his wife and the day in an episodic fashion, to the point that there were credits at the end of each chapter along with ""next time"" and ""last time"" intros and outros. It was a neat story, and a neat idea, and the combat was something out of the ordinary. Seems like it wouldn't be hard to follow up, right?American Nightmare almost seems like a demo for the whole game. The conciet of the plot in this iteration is that our hero is caught in a time loop, but effectively what this translates to is that you go through the same 3 small areas 3 times. There are no ""episodes"", there is no getting from point A to point B, you simply ""win"" the particular scene by progressing the story along, and are immediately greeted with a loading screen, taking you straight to the next area. Meanwhile the combat, while interesting in the first game, has not changed at all in this second, and every single enemy can be taken down the exact same way. Shine the light, shoot bullets. A little added variety would have done a bit to save it, but not much.Additionally, the story itself seems a bit muddied and vague, although given how much space they gave themselves to work with, it's surprising they managed to convey a cohesive story in such a small span of game. The badguy is bad, the good guy is good, he wins, and everything is fine. The credits then tell us that we haven't seen the last of Mr. Wake, but for the audience's sake, I hope Alan has brushed up on his writing skills.""I found this game shallow and pedantic.""-Peter Griffin			",562,119,23,62,35,3,62

												If the first game's story was silent hill oriented, this DLC is Siren oriented. Can't say I enjoyed this one as much as the original game. The game felt more action based rather than Survival Horror. You'll find full ammo restock in certain places so there's no fear running out of ammo, which is bad as a surv. horror genre. The original was a psychological horror this one felt more psycho thriller. This DLC was a good way to close the original game though.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												American Nightmare drops the repetition from its predecessor by adding new weapons and types of enemies to mix things up with, and its plot makes clever use of the same three locations in a number of ways. The actual gameplay is as solid as ever, and the storyline, though shorter, is just as well-written, with a more personable foe in the form of Alan's nemesis, Mr. Scratch. However, it may be an issue to you that this one is nowhere near as scary as the original Alan Wake, and feels more like an action game.			",210,26,0,15,9,0,14

												Overall Score: 7/10My advice: Wait 'til it drops under $7.50, only if you've played the first one.Genre: Action/Survival HorrorAs a small, semi-sequel to the original Alan Wake, AW:AN doesn't disappoint... much. For the $10 price tag, it's got enough content to keep you for a while. It's only about 6 hours long if you stop and get all the collectables, and Nightmare mode is difficult enough that I wasn't just breezing through every map.

If the game drops below $7.50, I'd snag it. Was worth the time and effort. Be warned though, some of those achievements are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get.			",455,127,7,69,23,6,41

												A follow-up to Alan Wake, ""American Nightmare"" fleshes out themes only touched on in the original. The plot is a little bit more straightforward this time around, but still leaves that feeling that you have only seen part of the bigger picture. A truly nasty antagonist, improvements to the combat engine, and an overall lighter tone, go a long way to make this game feel like a completely viable chapter in the Alan Wake storyline. Just don't be shocked when the ""Groundhog's Day"" structure betrays the games modest budget; or when the improvements to the combat make the game more action oriented, thus breaking some of the tension found in the previous title. If you enjoyed Alan Wake, this is a necessary chapter. If you didn't, there isn't anything here that is likely to change your misguided opinion.			",155,57,3,20,8,2,13

												It is kind of hard for me to consider this an actual standalone title although it actually is, it game feels more like a DLC for the initial Alan Wake game. The gameplay shifts to a more action based theme without losing much of the initial Alan Wake charm from the first game and although the game is actually you repeating the same three areas, it is woven so beautifully into the story that it really works as a plus for the game itself. Another plus for the game is that this time it features live action cut scenes that along with the general design of the game give you the feeling of watching a B Horror Movie, something Bruce Campbell would be in.

												Do not buy. You are essentially paying for the equivalent of scraps from the cutting room floor. The game is nothing more than Remedy trying out a few ideas with combat. There is zero effort in the story, characters or atmosphere. Everthing good about Alan Wake is entirely absent here. Plus, in a display if utter laziness, you need to play throguh the game THREE times to complete it. That's right, Remedy recycle the same three levels three times. Seriously, just avoid this. At the very least don't let them think they can pass off thier scraps for profit.			",204,32,1,34,42,5,88

												I like this a lot better than the other one. I wouldn't say it's a better game, but I enjoyed it a lot more, probably mostly because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wake is the bad guy this time, not the hero. The ugly hoodie is gone too, replaced by a less ugly shirt :)  The gameplay is more action focused and it doesn't bother trying to be spooky. There are only 3 maps and they are visited 3 times each, but imo that works with the story. The music is pretty cool too.It's very short (only 4 hours to completion for me) so I wouldn't say it's worth it at full price, but it's been discounted to below a pack of chips several times already, and I'd say it's a great buy at that price.

												American Nightmare kicks off right after Alan Wake, so you should really play that first. That said, American Nightmare fixes some of the problems with the original in terms of enemy and weapon variety, but doesn't really do a great deal with level design. If you can deal with that, it's a pretty engaging sequel. I do have to say that the antagonist of American Nightmare is way more interesting than whoever it was in the original. He'll either come across as campy or really unsettling; probably both.It's not as Stephen King-y as the original; it's split off to do its own thing, and I think it does it pretty well.

												Its really just a Fraction of a game but its still pretty fun, has repetative levels but still manages to spice things up with every one. not very challenging but i do like a good story. all in all it has a few minor gripes but its still pretty good. some people might complain that its only 3 hours long but thats at least a long enough time for the story to take you in and not to long so that its minor gripes start to group up on you and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. call it a 7/10			",182,38,0,41,19,0,5

												Great continuation of Alan Wake's story and if the price is right - I strongly recommend to play it!It's more focused on story depth and action and less on puzzle-solving... Also, you are properly equipped for fighting bad guys this time and ammo was NEVER an issue! :)Only con is that it took me only about 6 hours to complete including exploring the maps for the bonus content (""story-papers"")!

												American Nightmare is a stand alone expansion to Alan Wake from Remedy Entertainment. Originally an Xbox live title this has made its way over to the PC with a few tweaks. Graphics are not powerhouse hungry but its not going to make you vomit in disgust at its admitadly bland pallet. As this game is set mostly in the desert with minimal indoor environmets this game is no stranger to the colour brown. The PC version does look better than its console sibling with AA options and a HD texture pack.The gameplay is very similar to the main game with a familar over the shoulder third person camera with a reasonable FOV. Ok its a very console orientated FOV and this game does play better with a gamepad than a keyboard and mouse although you want cry and bang your head on the desk if you dont have a gamepad. So I would recommend plugging in a pad and scooting your chair back a tad for a more comforatable experience. The weapons have a nice feel to them, the traditional pistol, rifle and shotgun are back with interesting additions such as the nail gun. There is enough variety of weapons around and plenty of ammo to keep gameplay fresh. The flashlight returns to burn off the ""Darkness"" which acts as a shield to enemies making them imune to bullets. But like in the main game the enemies are vunerable to all forms of lights, whether this is car headlights, flares or the sun.The game lets face it is not very long. The story mode takes about 3/4 hours to complete but considering this started out as an xbox live arcade expansion this is not a bad thing. Especially when the game costs less than a pint. New to American Nightmare is an arcade mode. This is basically a horde mode escape the zombies make it till dawn affair. It has a couple of achievements and map unlocks but single player means its not something you are going to come back to.So should you buy it? Have you played Alan Wake? If not go pick that up. Its not expensive, has a great story in the style of Stephen King novels. This game is a bit of an oddball rounding off the story that a lot of people expected from the main game. If you have played the base game, then deffinately pick this up. Although a little repeptive in the story it provides a better finish to the story you got so into in the previous incarnation.

												The universe of Alan Wake is amazing and the writing is excellent. The graphics, character interactions, animations, and combat are all vastly improved for this short sequel to Alan Wake. Pick it up, support a decent game... and perhaps we'll get Alan Wake 2 to temper the need for more great storytelling games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is a very bad parody of the first one, the story is non-existant, you get to repeat your actions over and over and there is little to no interaction with other chracters. Dialogues are very cheesy and mr. scratch could have been used better. Would not suggest this to you unless it is on a bundle offer with the first one (which is good). The game also is more an arcade focused on shooting down things, the first one you had counted ammo and there was no wasting of it. Is like taking Silent hill and making it into DooM #deluded			",133,17,0,18,15,0,10

												It is kind of hard for me to consider this an actual standalone title although it actually is, it game feels more like a DLC for the initial Alan Wake game. The gameplay shifts to a more action based theme without losing much of the initial Alan Wake charm from the first game and although the game is actually you repeating the same three areas, it is woven so beautifully into the story that it really works as a plus for the game itself. Another plus for the game is that this time it features live action cut scenes that along with the general design of the game give you the feeling of watching a B Horror Movie, something Bruce Campbell would be in.

												We're supposed to give this a bad review because it's a failed triple A franchise, but honestly it's not really that different than any other triple A franchise out there. The fighting is fun, the mechanics are ok, but the game is never really creepy the way Resident Evil 4's opening was. It's not really a horror game, it's more of a supernatural shooter with some ok mechanics. What I think might make Alan Wake important is what it raises about triple A games and why some games become flagships like Halo or Uncharted and some end up like Alan Wake, because this is really not that different than any other blockbuster I've played recently. That said it's a horror game we're you're supposed to be afraid of what's out there, but then has a collection mechanic and more ammo drops than bad guys. They really should have just made the combat more in depth or maybe worked on disabling you a bit more and a little more oh♥♥♥♥♥♥run sequences. I never once even flinched leaving the safety of the light to find manuscrapt pages. These people need to play Amnesia more and Biohazard less.			",192,67,3,11,13,0,16

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is something of a sequel to the original Alan Wake. From what I understand it's the continuation of the story and was intended to be either released episodically or as a stop gap between the first and second game. Sadly there isn't any news on a second game coming so far, beyond the 'to be continued' that you get at the end credits.Anyway, the game itself is pretty good. It hasn't lost any of the voice acting or nice little bits. The Alan Wake series is one of the few games that actually makes me want to collect the collectibles,, which in this cases are manuscript pages that can be read. Each page reveals more of the world so The player can understand the world more.This title is a lot more combat orientated that the original with more varied enemies and tougher ones at that. Not to worry though your arsenal can be upgraded through weapons cases that are unlocked by finding the aforementioned collectibles. 3 gets you an smg, 10 a magnum and so on.I'd recommend this game, it's actually worth it's asking price, though replayability is low. There is a arcade mode that can make the game last a bit longer. Be aware that you really do need to like plot heavy games to really enjoy this title. ",538,242,9,92,52,4,86

Oh, and they make you play through the same areas three times. I know the time-loop is supposed to be a surprise, but ♥♥♥♥ this game. The story-mode is literally repeating the same fetch-quests three times in a row. The main draw is the arcade mode, which is just you in large arena trying to stay alive through the night fighting off enemies and racking up kills. There are several levels, and I only plaeyd it once.The combat is still stale as hell. There are some new weapons, and some minor improvements that I don't care to mention cause its still the same old♥♥♥♥♥♥Recommneded to suicidal people; this'll give them a little push.

												A follow-up to Alan Wake, ""American Nightmare"" fleshes out themes only touched on in the original. The plot is a little bit more straightforward this time around, but still leaves that feeling that you have only seen part of the bigger picture. A truly nasty antagonist, improvements to the combat engine, and an overall lighter tone, go a long way to make this game feel like a completely viable chapter in the Alan Wake storyline. Just don't be shocked when the ""Groundhog's Day"" structure betrays the games modest budget; or when the improvements to the combat make the game more action oriented, thus breaking some of the tension found in the previous title. If you enjoyed Alan Wake, this is a necessary chapter. If you didn't, there isn't anything here that is likely to change your misguided opinion.			",155,57,3,20,8,2,13

												Firstly, I have to say that Alan Wake is one of my all-time favourites: plot, setting, gameplay... and this is why I quite do not arrive to understand what is the meaning of this piece of crap. What was the need to make a game that do not contribute to anything to Alan Wake's storyline. If you Remedy wanted focus on action, why make us suffer the tedious and empty plot; and not once, but three times! Yes, you will have to basically repeat the same three levels three times. Being honest, without all its atmosphere and components Alan Wake wouldn't be but an action game of the bunch. Sumarizing, please do not waste your time, if you judge it valuable enough, on this game; not omittable, but a must avoid.			",220,75,8,17,9,1,30

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is an overral improvment over the first game,combat feels a bit nicer,theres a big selection of weapons,more enemy variaty and in my opinion a better enviroment however the game is very short and forces you to re-track and replay alot of levels which is a cheap way of making the game longer. It's still a fun game, i had a blast with it. Most complaints can be silenced by the fact then it's not a very expensive, it's only 13 euros and it drops to around 2 or 4 euros when it goes on sale. So if you loved the first game, i reccomend you pick this up.			",226,21,2,15,9,2,22

												It's an okay game, it’s defiantly not as good as the original “Alan Wake” but it’s playable. The story is not that good and goes around in circles for too long (literally) but has a nice idea to it. The environment is really nicely done, I can’t really explain it though.Besides a story mode there is also an arcade mode which is basically normal gameplay in a survival manner which I am not really impressed by, it is quite slow (at least the first levels) and didn’t really make me want to play it.It might be worth getting if you really liked the gameplay part of the first Alan Wake but besides that it really feels more like a DLC then a stand-alone game.

												If this is cheap, go ahead and get it. But if you're a fan of the gameplay and tone of the first Alan Wake, then don't bother. This game is significantly shifted towards the Action Game genre, abandoning a great deal of the survival horror elements of the original. This also really cuts into the tension like crazy. It's not really about suspense anymore, which was one of the first game's strengths. That suspence actually was what held up a good chunk of the gameplay. But when you're given a sub machine gun by level one it's not even fair by that point.Story wise, it's not as sharp either. Now Alan has become some kind of creative god through his writing, and barely anything about the end of the first game is addressed. This is a fun little arcadey shooter, but not a good Alan Wake game.			",143,33,3,14,12,2,10

												Game is great for the price. The story is amazing and the gameplay is fun. However there are some issues. First and foremost Alan has transforming itno Rambo Wake and now has a very OP arsenal of automatic weapons which and a super flashlight which regens its energy within 1.5 secs. Plus the difficulty level has gone out the window since you can mow through a horde without effort, the new enemy types while creative are very weak, and the puzzles can hardly be called puzzles since they basically spam you with the answer while being solved. Finally this game has a total of 3 areas which get used repeatedly, and only 3 interactive characters(other than wake and scratch). Altogether if you are interested in the Alan Wake universe I strongly recommend this game it is fun and not only ties up the loose end that is Mr. Scratch, but also gives you an update on whats happening in the real world after the events of Alan Wake.

												First off, it's pretty short. It took me 5 hours. You're guided most of the way, so you can't really draw it out. it's a lot easier than the first, if you played that one. I think I died 3 times, and that's it. Ammunition is plentiful in this go round, and the flashlight charges really quickly. It has mostly the same elements: manuscripts, videos to watch and audio to listen to. If you really liked the first, you might like this one as well. It's very story driven, intersperced with you doing missions and killing bad guys. There's an interesting twist in the story line that goes on just long enough. If you're thinking about buying the first, it wouldn't hurt to get this one and play it beforehand, if it was cheap enough. it's a nice primer.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend to anyone who liked Alan Wake; the original needs to be played first though (including the special chapters) to appreciate this IMHO. Without wanting to spoil too much, this expands on the 'Mr. Scratch' stroyline. The story places Alan in an episode of 'Night Springs' (Twighlight Zone Parody), complete with bad voiceover guy and in general has a quite different 'feel' to the original being set in Arizona not spooky woodland. Gameplay has been expanded to include new enemies and weapons and it could be argued that this is simplay an expansion to set Alan in a more combat heavy role - as such the tension has been wound back, but I liked the feel of it. The arcade mode puts you in a basic wave survival scenario - again pushing the additional weapons and enemies.			",165,71,0,8,11,4,16

												Game is a bit short (5 hrs of gameplay)  and I have missed some clues when the level is going to end (I have been trying to find all the manuscripts). Storytelling is absolutely awesome and the enemies are more various. The game itself is less scarry (than original Alan Wake) and becoming more arcade. But in the end I can tell I was enjoying the game. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The universe of Alan Wake is amazing and the writing is excellent. The graphics, character interactions, animations, and combat are all vastly improved for this short sequel to Alan Wake. Pick it up, support a decent game... and perhaps we'll get Alan Wake 2 to temper the need for more great storytelling games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's hard to recommend this title. In a way it started out as a nice, albeit quite cheesy, video game based off of the original. The narrative, one of the best things of the previous title, is extremely silly. A complete joke compared to the original. The game has you explore a handful of regions three times in a row, explained in the story as some kind of time cycle or trial-and-error run as Alan Wake tries to re-write his story. As far as gameplay is concerned, it means you'll spend doing roughly the same stuff over and over again and simply feels lazy on the part of the developers. The areas are okay, certainly not as atmospheric as the Pacific North West of the original. The game is considerably short as well, clocking in at three hours at most (I've finished my run in 2.5 hours). As short as it is, the game actually starts to drag halfway through since there isn't any new in terms of scenery. Gameplay-wise, however, it is as solid as the previous title. The enemies are diverse and the gunplay, mixed with the light mechanic, still feels as fresh as in the original. Ammunition is less scarce so the survival aspect that was present in the original is gone (safe havens are also more frequent), though this isn't all too bad. As a standalone it is hard to recommend, though I guess it should be seen as more of an expansion or perhaps (standalone) DLC. Taking the price-tag into account, I'm giving the game the benefit of the doubt. I feel the gameplay is enough to carry it.Bottom line is that it is a fun game to kill an evening, but don't expect this to be ""Alan Wake 2"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved Alan Wake. It's one of my favorite games of all time, without a doubt. But this is just not good enough. All the things that made Alan Wake charming and captivating are gone. It seems forced and rushed for the sake of making an extra buck. I would write an elaborate review to prove this but I honestly don't even feel like it. A real let down, not that it is bugged out or anything, but it's just all the short comings of Alan Wake put together. I finished the entire game and unlike the original that made me want to go back and find every page, this just did not give me those same desires. Everything that made the original so special is stripped from this DLC and leaves you wondering why they priced it so high. It's time to move on I guess and wait for whatever else they do next, since Sam Lake really is a great writer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is a third person shooter in the psychological horror genre.  It is a stand-alone DLC that continues the story of the original Alan Wake game.You play as Alan again fighting against his evil alter-ego and his minions of darkness.  He still wields up to six weapons – 1-hand gun, 2-hand gun, flare gun, flares, flashbang grenades and, most crucial, a flashlight.  The flashlight is required to remove the enemy shields in order to make them vulnerable to your guns.  Ammo (and batteries for your flashlight) are everywhere and there are quite a few more guns to choose from.The story this time around pits you against your doppelganger, created by the Dark Presence.  There are some new interesting variations on the minions you face which helps against monotony.   What doesn’t help is that the three zones that the story takes you through get re-used three times each, creating nine areas to complete the game.  They do their creative best to make things a little different each time through, but there is no way to hide the inevitable repetition.The graphics have been slightly updated from the original.  There are some great cutscenes and the voice acting is still superb.  The real life actor playing Alan Wake has some choice scenes playing the evil twin and taunting Alan through videos you can play on various TV sets.They have toned down the many collectibles from the first game.  There are 50+ manuscript pages to find and these provide story exposition and are required to unlock better weapons.  Likewise, there are only 12 achievements now and half are associated with the new Arcade Mode.  Arcade Mode removes the storyline completely and allows the player to try and survive the night in different maps against waves of enemies.  You can compare your scores against your friends….still no co-op or multi-player available.American Nightmare’s Story Mode can easily be completed in less than five hours, although the Arcade Mode can provide some additional hours of fun.  Overall, worth playing if you wait for the right Steam sale.			",183,121,5,25,14,1,29

												Es war ein regnerischer Tag als ich das erste Mal ""Alan Wake´s American Nightmare"" gestartet hatte. Es war dunkel und der Charakter erhob sich zum ersten Mal aus dem Dreck. Wir starten das Spiel mit einer Taschenlampe und einer Pistole. Man versteht schnell wie es funktioniert: Taschenlampe auf den Gegner, warten, schießen. Jeder Gegner in diesem Spiel lässt sich auf diese Weise ohne Probleme erledigen. Die Steuerung und die Grafik haben mir gefallen. Kommen wir nun zum eigentlichem Problem von Alan Wake´s American Nightmare, man steht wie ich schon sagte aus dem Dreck auf, erledigt Aufgaben (Dreh das Ventil zu, mach dies, mach das) und kommt durch 4 verschiedene Level die zu einem Showdown mit sich selbst führen. Ja, man kämpft gegen sein böses Ich. Leider hat ""ALAN"" aber etwas vergessen, also steht er wieder am Start auf. Ich lachte  und dachte mir:"" Na, was kommt jetzt"". Richtig, das ganze Spiel nochmal, mit geringen Abweichungen. Als ich dann endlich wieder beim Endgegner angekommen war und das Spiel nun zwei mal gesehen hatte passierte das Unvorstellbare. Ich stand wieder am Anfang. Mir standen bereits die Haare zu Berge, da der Charakter scheinbar immer wieder Teile zu vergessen scheint. Man sieht also wieder die gleichen Leute und die gleichen Orte, mit nur geringen Abweichungen in den Aufgaben. Den Rest kennt ihr ja und ihr wacht wieder auf. Dann spielt ihr das ganze nochmal, und fertig. Spiel vorbei. Spielzeit? Unter 4 Stunden. War es die 10,00-15,00€ Wert? Nein. Für 15,00€ hätte ich auch zwei mal ins Kino gehen können, und zwar für UNTERSCHIEDLICHE Filme.			",67,9,6,2,29,0,8

												American Nightmare improves greatly upon its predecessor in terms of combat and environmental variety. It’s also got a pretty cool spin-off “groundhog day” thing going on at the expense of getting fatigued from running through the same areas over and over. Unfortunately, you’d be hard pressed to find this scary in any way and the over-abundance of ammo kills any survival element the original had. It’s not episodic like the first, but it’s also on the very short side.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While this game isn't as solid as an experience as the original Alan Wake, there are more weapons and an arcade styled horde mode about surviving until the morning (which essentially just means kill as many enemies in 10 minutes for the most points you can muster). The story mode is where this game will disappoint, as it reuses each level with minor differences multiple times (with the excuse that you are stuck repeating your past night like the movie Groundhog Day). Not the best third-person shooter, but for fans of the original looking for more Alan Wake action, then you can find enjoyment here.			",410,89,6,34,27,6,44

												I was really anxious to play through the sequel to a game that really touched upon me, and I'm sad to say that some of my fears were confirmed. The level designers have been lazy, and the music removes all the scary stuff, as every appearance of enemies is pretty predictable. The way the story is told is also a bit too... I don't know, it just feels off. It used to be a horror story, and somewhere along the way it got turned into a fairy tale. It just doesn't work for me. That said, it's nice to see that they kept the graphical style, I love the new weaponry, and I'm a sucker for happy endings. So for the sake of the story, and getting closure, I would suggest playing it - just don't set your expectations too high.			",248,24,2,74,34,2,91

												Compelling plot, great graphics and sound design, loaded with atmosphere, and decent gameplay add up to make this a very good experience. After playing Alan Wake I didn't expect anything else! The game mechanics that made Alan Wake feel fresh and innovative (fighting with light etc.) make a welcome return, but new to the frachise is an interesting story that plays around with temporality in a way usually reserved for the movies. Indeed, the whole experience feels (quite deliberately, I expect) cinematic.This stand-alone expansion pack doesn't quite achieve the scope of its predecessor, Alan Wake, so I would recommend trying that game out first. Nevertheless, this stands as an enjoyable experience in its own right.			",201,53,9,18,34,5,46

												*This review will contain some spoilers for the story of Alan Wake, as well as some gameplay spoilers for American Nightmare. Read at your own disgression!* Alan Wake´s American Nightmare is a spinoff-title to the original Alan Wake. While it shares a lot of similarities with its predecessor, there is a notable amount of changes and new stuff that one should be aware before considering playing it, as these changes and additions will decide whether this game works for you or not.The story takes place within an episode of the TV show ""Night Springs"" (basically the Twilight Zone of Videogames). Alan, still trapped within the Darkness of the Lake after the end of the first game (and its DLC, to be more precise), has now been trapped within one of his own stories, by none other than his doppelgänger, Mr. Scratch. Caught in a loop of endless repetition and constant torment by Scratch, Alan has to find a way to ""break the circle"" and return to the real world before his doppelgänger has completely overtaken his ""real"" life.The gameplay of American Nightmare, at first glance, is basically the same as it was in Alan Wake: You run around in comparatively small, open areas, defeat Taken, collect manuscript pages to fill in story details, and solve some (very easy) puzzles or try and reach a certain spot to advance the story, while occacionally watching TV, listening to the radio and talking to a handful of people. This all takes place on three maps: A Gas Station/Motel in the middle of the Arizonian Desert, an Observatory, and a Drive-in Theater. While each map is quite distinct from the others, you also have to revisit each map several times over the course of the game. While this is explained and justified quite well within the story, this still means that two-thirds of the campaign are repeated content (minor changes notwithstanding). Thankfully, the actual gameplay is good enough so that one can look past it.American Nightmare, gameplay-wise, improves on both Alan Wake´s enemy design and weapon selection. While the regular Taken are still the bread-and-butter of your combat enemies, there are also various new enemy types that demand some different strategies from the usual ""shine your light on them, destroy their shield, and then shoot them"". This includes Taken that are immune to your flashlight and instead split into smaller versions of themselves, Taken that flee by transforming into bird flocks, and Taken that throw ""Darkness Grenades"" into your direction, but keep their distance, among other enemy types. To counter them, Alan now also has access to a much larger arsenal, which gets unlocked the more manuscript pages you collect, so even if you don´t care about the story at all, you should still keep your eyes open for them. The new arsenal includes pistols, a SMG, an Assault Rifle, a Combat Shotgun, a crossbow which ignores the enemy shield, and a Nailgun, among others. Some stuff from Alan Wake also makes a return, like the flaregun and the flashbangs, but they have become quite a bit weaker, no longer insta-killing anything, but rather destroying their shields quickly (which is still useful, of course).The gameplay in general is alot less ""survival"" and much more action-orientated. You will pretty much never run out of ammo or flashlight batteries, individual enemies are alot less threatening than they used to but appear in bigger numbers, and there is alot less general ""creepiness"" in wandering around the desert (though that may just be me). The game, in all fairness, also doesn´t try to be a horror game, unless you count the psychological ""threat to your very existence, a doppelgänger overtaking your life"" angle. In that regard, your occasional encounters with Mr. Scratch are fun, he´s quite a cool and fun, if decidedly hammy, villain, but there´s unfortunately no fight against him, or any boss fight at all, for that matter, which feels like a wasted opportunity, given the more arcade-y gameplay.Once you´re done with the campaign, there´s also an Arcade Mode, in which you have to survive a certain amount of time on various maps while fending off enemies, raising your combo meter (by killing enemies and evading their attacks) and getting enough points to earn stars and unlock new and more difficult maps. Its quite fun (and more difficult than the main campaign ever gets), but probably not something that you will play for more than a few hours.Overall, I personally would recommend American Nightmare, especially if it´s at a discount. If you liked Alan Wake overall, but disliked its gameplay, you will probably like it. If you didn´t like Alan Wake or aren´t interested in the franchise at all, I would still say that you should check it out, but the game will probably not change your overall opinion on the series.

												I wish the first game was like this. streamlined & more consise Alan Wake American nightmare does everything better than it's older brother. there is more of an open world feel to this game not quite so linear, the main campaign mode is about 5 hours long.where you will spend most of your time is the arcade mode 10 levels to unlock with endless replay value, no story just great gameplay, & to unlock all 10 levels is tough very tough, you will easily spend 10 to 20 hours in this mode. Very addictive slick gameplay.Graphics the game is very well presented with a great art style & the audio is top notch for £6.99 this game is worth owning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7/10 - Not as good as original game but its ok. Characters are rather flat. The story is a bit boring at first but it gets more interesting after a while. The game itself its more like a mixture of Alan Wake and Left 4 Dead (you get ammo refils very often in here - you dont actually feel scared at all).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The pages you pick up were everywhere and saying the same thing over and over. Still good and fun.  The new weapons and enemies were great and the AI seems to have taken a step up as well which added to the challenge.  Definitely more action oriented this go around.			",199,55,6,18,6,1,29

												AW's:AN is a stand alone expansion to the amazing Alan Wake. They are very similar but there are plenty of differences. The gameplay/combat returns but that is almost the only returning aspect. There are many references to the first game and those who play this without playing the original will likely be confused in many parts and miss out on many refences, but don't let that deter you from experiencing this expansion if the original is out of your price range. While there is still a high level of detail, the plot isn't as great in this one. It is interesting for sure, but the mechanics of how it progress require a level of patience from the player. The story campaign is 3-4 hours long which isn't too bad given this is simply an expansion, but there is an interesting arcade mode to add another hour's worth or more if your very interested in the leaderboards. I still hope to see more from Alan Wake as Remedy really does have something great here.4.25/5			",384,54,8,12,17,5,16

												American Nightmare is a slight step down from its first game.  The story felt slightly shorter than AW and the whole time travel idea is a sloppy excuse to recycle the maps and characters.The Goods:  The graphics are as good as AW if not better, as well as better optimization.  Just about all of the mechanics from AW are there, save from a few small things.  The UI has the same information as AW, but it looks different.  For example, the health bar in American Nightmare is a proper bar where AW had a bit that surrounded a compass.  You can also turn off the UI in American Nightmare, however the visual cues aren't as present.  Other than the story mode there is an arcade survival minigame that the first game lacks.The Not-So-Goods:  The game was lacking in real character develpment.  There was a time travel plot device that recycled all of the maps.  There is a character known as Mr. Scratch that is one of the worst additions to a sequel.  Overall sloppy story.  There is no real mention to Alice other than the end of the game.  The subtlety of the visuals in AW are not present in American Nightmare.  While the weapons are much more varied than AW, it feels like the nailgun for instance is just a rapid fire pistol with lacking damage.  You cannot drain the Taken's darkness from them by simply pointing their flashlight at it.  You must boost it as well.I give this game a 6/10 for its lacking story.  However, most of what makes AW great is present in this one.  The score is so low because the decisions Remedy made to the game are slightly sloppy.			",328,106,6,36,39,2,33

												Delightful addition to Alan Wake, not quite as ""pretty"" as the locations in the original but the gameplay has been refined and it plays well.  The wildly swinging camera controls have been improved, and the limited levels are stretched/replayability added very nicely by a neat gimmick in the storyline.

The format makes it easy to pick up and play for short sessions, the graphics are excellent, the writing is very good as is the combat (both better than the original, methinks). They do go over enough story that you don't have to have played the original, but having done so lets you appreciate both games more.I really, REALLY hope they follow up to this, or make a proper sequel to Alan Wake.

												Short version: Not worth buying. Short ( <4 hours if you don't read everything ), bland, and overly simplified. Would be better suited to be a single scenario in the base game rather than a stand alone game.The game itself is very short ( start to finish only took me 4 hours and that was with me exploring and reading all the pages I found ), and ""streamlined"" into being a generic arcade third person shooter that delivers a moderately interesting plot across the same three game areas that forces you to play them three times with only slight variations each time.Gone are the different flashlights - although the one you have is decent.Gone is the need to conserve ammo and batteries - each area has a box that fills all your ammo and batteries even if you are out of everything.Only a few new enemies are introduced - spiders, which are defeated in the same manner as the birds from the original game, an enemy that splits when you shine light on it, and a super-heavy enemy.The plot itself is somewhat interesting from a conceptual standpoint, but the ending has a strong taste of deus ex machina while a majority of the plot consists of you watching Mr. Scratch on various televisions or through live action video.

												A good game, but not a sequel to the events originally described in the former Alan Wake (which is a bit of a shame).The plot is overall acceptable, but in the end some choices make the game less enjoyable than what it could be. Neverthless, the style is quite intriguing and while not being entirely unique you happen to walk through several beatiful settings (which sadly happen to repeat a lot, though). Everything gameplay related and possibly voice actors related is literally ported from the earlier Alan Wake, with the benefits and drawback of a game that by now is a few years old. The engine still does its job but you'll happen to feel a need for something fresh, which is quite likely the point where the soundtrack excels (with some impressive - and fun - moments).Overall it's a good game, but it could have been a much more interesting project if it wasn't going to be an Alan Wake spin off (you still feel like playing a game that was crumped a bit to fit either budget limits or time deadines).

Only downside was they reused levels too much in order to simulate a trapped in a nightmare feel. But being liner it just comes out as a bit dull. Also no Barry except in the opening cutscene, I like Barry as the hapless idiot. In this you only get Alan Wake x2 and three women that all look like they moonlight as underwear models (not a bad thing just saying) and a bunch of victims that I don't feel anything for cause they were very generic.Main game was awesome and I thought arcade levels were poo poo.

												This is a spin off from the original Alan Wake, so the first one should be recommended before playing this. This game is is pretty short. The same locations are are used which makes the game very repetitive after a while. There isn't much variation to the fighting. It is a change from the original Alan Wake as this one is more action-orientated, there was tons of ammo and i never ran out of batteries for the flashlight. The soundtrack is really nice, especially the Poets of the Fall songs. The graphics are ok, it's pretty dark most of the time though. I recommend playing this game if you liked Alan Wake and you wanted to play within that universe more.			",275,54,5,28,16,1,19

												I would recommend this game for sure. Although I feel like this sequel is a bit rushed compared to it's previous title. I would like it if they made a 3rd game, but longer and nothing where you go in circles, literally. It took me 8 hours or so to finish the game on Nightmare mode, it was interesting for a plot, like watching a LOOONG episode of Night Spring tv. Which is the point, its Alan's nightmare brought to life. Pros:+ I get to shoot shadowy psycho killers again and NOT feel bad about it, unlike in the previous game+ Live action sequences of Alan+ Great Music+ Interesting story plotCons:-- No Big Heavy Duty Flash Light ;_; <-- That was a double negative- Weapon Damage feels different from previous game (When I use a flare gun, that's my last option thing to use, but it got weaker in this sequel.. :/ )- The grass looks like a higher definition version from MineCraft (I mean its a + if you're into that thing, sure)- Game is too short, wished for more... GIVE ME MORE! D<  Overall, if you want to know what happened to Alan after playing 'Alan Wake', sure go ahead and buy this game. But if you want it to be as awesome as the Alan Wake game, then you might get disappointed with this sequel. Either way, I just want to know what happens next.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had me on the fance of recommending and not recommending.The game is only 2.3gb which tells me that this is a short game (but i have been wrong before so i've played it)The Game only has Three levels, that are repeated three times for the story (though each time you revisit the level, the goal is quicker to get to and new enemies to fight).The story takes place after the first game Alan Wake. stuck in the darkness fighting Mr. Scartch, his double gangger. who been busy in the real world while keeping Alan Wake in limbo.The gameplay is still the same as the first game, but without the ""staying in the dark too long well bring out enemies to ambush you"" part that got annoying in the first game when trying to scanning the level for collectables. as for what may cause me to be on the fences. The story isnt as good as the first game and honestly with the revisting levels. just get boring real quick. if it wasnt for my inposive nature to get all the collectables in one playthrough wasnt  getting in the way, my game play hours would be real short im only recommending this game if you want to something to play quick or wanting to complete your alan wake collection (as of now there is only two)			",129,12,3,15,6,1,2

												Episodic gaming is hardly a new concept. From Half-Life 2: Episode 1 to Sam & Max Save The World and SiN Episodes, there were many attempts at this format. Alan Wake's American Nightmare is different. Despite being a direct sequel to the original game, it is essentially a self-contained story with a beginning and a satisfying ending. In terms of quality, American Nightmare matches and occasionally surpasses the original. The combat has been improved (there is even an alternative aiming mode offered in the configurations menu); the improved overall feedback as well as the expanded arsenal and creative new foes make the 'fight with light' combat especially enjoyable. The story is the hightlight of American Nightmare, taking full advantage of the episodic format with its clever twist. The dialogue is snappy and frequently genuinely funny. The main antagonist, Mr. Scratch (or Mr. [...] if you prefer), is disturbing and hilarious, often both at once. I am running out of space here. Play it!			",386,109,17,59,33,5,56

Great fun, good atmosphere, solid gameplay, and for once music that actually means something to the game other than the ""ooooh something spooky is coming!"".  Will be the guardian of Light again!

												While the game got me excited for a more open ended structure with the wide open skies of the desert setting, it's all just for show. The first game was criticized for being repetitive and this one is actually worse. It has next to no interactivity with it's world and the writing isn't getting any better. It actually forces you to do the same things three times that weren't even fun the first time you did it. The game is content with presenting you with a story, rather than letting the player experience it first hand through interaction and puzzle solving.			",273,80,5,24,17,5,23

And these 4 levels you need to play through several times to complete the game.This feels very repetitive which i don't like.The new weapons in this games are pretty cool and the way you need to unlocked is nicely done.

												This is a spin off from the original Alan Wake, so the first one should be recommended before playing this. This game is is pretty short. The same locations are are used which makes the game very repetitive after a while. There isn't much variation to the fighting. It is a change from the original Alan Wake as this one is more action-orientated, there was tons of ammo and i never ran out of batteries for the flashlight. The soundtrack is really nice, especially the Poets of the Fall songs. The graphics are ok, it's pretty dark most of the time though. I recommend playing this game if you liked Alan Wake and you wanted to play within that universe more.			",275,54,5,28,16,1,19

												The sequel is okay, but not as good. It has an interesting story and a sort of ""Borderland's"" feel graphically wise, it plays out like an episode of Night Springs (in game version of The Twilight Zone) including a voice describing the conundrum. My only real complaint with the sequel is that it's sexist, you interact with only three other characters, all ""well modeled"" women. A buxom mechanic, a cocktail dress/lab coat wearing scientist, and one that's hard for me to describe but a 20-something flannel wearing neophyte who's a little too easy after she was touched by darkness.

												Playing the same 3 levels 3 times is boring and repetative. As a fan of the original game, I would not recoomend this title.Furthermore, the checkpoint system for saving games is ridiculous and especially in this title, it is a complete cuckold.If you want to replay any previous ""acts"" or areas you've been through to collect all script pages, you start with just a pistol and lose all your previously collected weapons, therefore making it impossible to complete the final act thus the game.

												So just to put in perspective, I've beat the game twice in the 4 ish hours that i've logged on it. Story is kinda weird, spooky ish, not scary and at times kinds creepy. Perhaps I had to play the 1st one to really know the whole backstory, but definitely not one of my top 10. Too bad too... the games interactivity was flawlessly smooth, the voice acting was spot on, albeit kinda creepy as said before, and the overall mood was consistant throughout without 1 single bug. It's not that I don't recommend this game based on it objectively, but this is not my kind of game. If you like story book animated games where its basically narative, and you just do what it asks you to do, with a little variation, then go for it. It plays very smoothly. You want a game where decisions matter and you get choices... pass on it.			",60,1,0,12,6,0,6

												At $2.00 or something this game is alright or a bit more if you're a huge fan of the combat in the original game. It's short arcady shooter with not that much of a story or character development. Almost 0 horror too. It's really just a 2hr machinegunning  DLC side quest for Alan Wake.The good:More and more guns.Not as annoying flashlight mechanics as with the original Alan Wake, here your flashlight is much stronger imo.Slightly improved graphics. Texture work seems to be better at least. Performance is up too perhaps, but might be because of less of a render distance.New unique enemies.The bad:Really short and repetive. You pretty much play the game through 3 times in 3 hours. It's like groundhog day the movie into casual horror shooter game. Each time something is a bit different though.Is there really a story? Not much.Felt pretty easy too, I played it through on normal, not sure I'd touch this game again. They buffed the flashlight, but didn't really increase enemy hitpoints or anything.There's no horror really. Even less than in the original game, which wasn't really all that scary. This time there's no dark places really or any fog. No puzzles to change the pace. Hell,  I wouldn't mind some sort of car chase thing either :D			",144,21,3,12,7,1,19

												This game is one of the best games I ever played. If you like mysterious and thrilling games this is the game for you. The graphics make it realistic and scary. The only thimg I would say I wasn't satisfied with was the pointing of the gun. It's a little difficult to handle but I'm sure I will get the hang of it eventually. Other than that it was excellent. Also If you haven't played the first Alan Wake I suggest you do before you play this one. It's not like you are missing a lot but there are some important details that will answer questions. I strongly recommend this game for those fans of surprises and mystery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I got this game because it was really cheap (~$4.00 or so) and becaues I loved the first game. American Nightmare uses the exact same game mechanics, of course, but puts you in a few differnet locations. I'll do this without spoiling anything - there are 3 locations that you play in, and after you finish the 3rd you get stuck in a 'time-loop' and have to do them all again, then once you finish the 3rd location that time you have to do it ONCE AGAIN. It's a cheap way to extend the game and I don't really like the way they did it. That being said, it's still the same great Alan Wake gameplay. I loved the way the weapons felt in AW1 and i still feel that way about the weapons in this game. They sound great and really feel powerful when you use them.TL;DR - Not worth the full price of $15.00 - but for $5.00 or less it's worth it. Repetitive gameplay is it's only downfall - and it's a big one.			",188,62,3,19,18,2,20

												This game is essentially a reworked engine of the original game used for an arcade mode.  The story mode is kind of sidestory and IMO doesn't play as enjoyably as the original did.This is partly because of setting and thematic.  The zones are too open and have little to no distortion or aesthetic effects.  More gun variety is okay, but the change to flare guns are not IMO.  They are much less useful since they no longer kill, same with flashbangs.  Arcade mode is okay, it plays decently and is not a pushover, but it's not especially deep either.  A co-op mode would be much more enjoyable.Prolly get this on sale, or just wait for a sequel.  Its okay.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												A quirky side chapter/followup on the original Alan Wake, American Nightmare polishes the battle mechanics and sprinting, although they didn't touch the climbing (thankfully you do none or very little of it here). The game takes place within 3 distinct areas, has a few collectibles for which the franchise (I guess we can call it that now) is known for, and a great story, thought not as good as the original, it still serves to know what is transpiring after the end of AW. They also took note on the lack of enemy diversity and introduced a few new ones here as well.Now, there's also a very fun Arcade mode, a wave style battle arena, in which you have to battle hoards of Taken for 10 minutes until the sun rises and the battle ends. If you've played RE mercenaries, it's similar, although much simpler and not as hard. The levels come in two varieties: Normal Mode in which the enemies come in limited waves, and Nightmare Mode in which the enemies consistently keep spawning with no breaks between waves. It took me 12.5 hours to beat it 100%, it may take you less if you're skilled at wave-style arena games. It's rewardingly challenging but not too difficult to achieve, in my opinion.I highly recommend this game for its gameplay and story as well as its fun arcade mode; it's fully worth the price of admission, but perhaps you'll want to get it during a sale.

""American Nightmare"" fixes many issues with the original game, such as lack of enemy variety, weapon variety, combat responsiveness, and player character stamina. The game also plays a lot more like the special DLC for ""Alan Wake"" rather than the main game. If the first game was Stephen King meets Twin Peaks, then this is The Twilight Zone meets Groundhog Day.			",350,94,8,47,34,4,49

A huge improvement over the original. Large, explorable areas, numerous weapon upgrades, and a ton of new enemies. It's quite short, but definitely worth the $10 price, especially if you are a fan of the universe.			",103,10,0,13,9,0,7

												How are people liking this!? I mean, it started out pretty decently... until the ""game"" stopped becoming a game. It is literally a huge, tedious collect-a- thon where you go through the same levels, doing the same stuff that you already did, over and over again. I get it, the whole ""plot"" is that (SPOILERS) Mr.Wake is stuck in a time loop and is trying to make things right so that he may finally put an end to all the crap happening. Okay, yeah... that's fitting and that's okay. However, it is not okay when your so called ""game"" consists of (like I've said before) going through the same thing, again and again. It was interesting the first time but now, it's just getting on my nerves. It's boring, repetitive (literally), and just down right unenjoyable to have to go through. It's clear, at least to me that the developers did not put much thought into this and they sure seem to have run out of ideas half way through making this. To make things even worse, there is no variety. They try to switch it up with the tasks but, it's obviously the same ones that you just did but, in a different order... seriously, that's it. However, that's not really the worst thing about this. I think that the worst thing about this so calle ""game"" is the fights and the enemies. Since when was it okay to surround the player with more than twenty enemies!? Or so, it seems. There are way too many enemies during a fight and to amp up the unfairness even further, they are stronger, faster, very resilliant to your flashlight (or any ligh for that matter), and just close to impossible to kill, dodge, or runaway from. By the time you're even able to pull up your gun, you're surrounded and are being beaten within an inch of your life. You'll be trying your hardest to break the darkness off of them and shoot them but of course, while you're in the middle of doing this, there will be multiple enemies allready surrounding you. Nevermind the fact that your flashlight charge barely lasts long enough to even break the darkness on one enemy! You only have enough charge to even do one enemy at a time which obviously, doesn't work and just slows you down. And then finally, it really does seem like not that much thought was given to the programming. What I mean is that, you'll out run the enemy and be more than safe distance away from him but, it doesn't matter because somehow, he can still hit you. Enemy attacks are also very diffivult to get out of and so, if you get hit even once, then you might as well give up becasue you'll just get stuck into an enemy's combo and killed instantly. There is so much more that I could probablty complain about here but, I've already taken up enough space and I just can't think of anything else at the moment. Besides, trying to think about this game at all is slightly infuriating me. That's the key word here, ""infuriating"".,, that's all this will ever be, so much to the point where I flat out quit playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very brief but good Alan Wake game. It is more focused on action and less on storytelling than its predecessor, but still it manages to squeeze a compelling storyline into its 3 hour length. It also has some end game content in the form of an arcade mode. Overall it's a good action packed game and totally worth its cheap asking price.			",341,77,9,32,16,2,38

												Compelling plot, great graphics and sound design, loaded with atmosphere, and decent gameplay add up to make this a very good experience. After playing Alan Wake I didn't expect anything else! The game mechanics that made Alan Wake feel fresh and innovative (fighting with light etc.) make a welcome return, but new to the frachise is an interesting story that plays around with temporality in a way usually reserved for the movies. Indeed, the whole experience feels (quite deliberately, I expect) cinematic.This stand-alone expansion pack doesn't quite achieve the scope of its predecessor, Alan Wake, so I would recommend trying that game out first. Nevertheless, this stands as an enjoyable experience in its own right.			",201,53,9,18,34,5,46

												Only about 3 hours long, way easier than its predecessor, the only reason to play it is if you've already played Alan Wake and you just want to have some mindless fun, because the game has lost its survival elements. I don't even know if the story of AWAN is canon, but if it is, at least it answers some questions from AW's ending. The game is not bad, but it doesn't deserve more than a 6.5, especially when compared to its prequel.			",276,61,1,35,11,4,34

												If you are going into this game expecting a story and atmosphere on par with the original Alan Wake then you are going to be a little let down.  The story I feel is simply there for some decent filler (it has its moments).  What this game more than makes up for is the arcade mode (which is how the idea of American Nightmare came about, as a score-attack game).  How do you balance out the larger arsenal of weapons and more action?  Plop the player into an arena and throw more enemies at them.While the arenas themselves are timed (and eventually end if you don't die) the real challenge is getting a good score.  The interesting bit about this is to get a higher score you want to be evading danger more often than dispatching enemies.Pick it up if you want a little bit of extra story on top of a solid score-attack gamemode.

												I'm only going to speak for the main ""story""Alan Wake is the Prisoner of Trashkaban in this turd-filled DLC. You won't pay for this, and it will likely be given to you free or at a very discounted rate with the purchase of Alan Wake, and rightfully so. The fact that only IGN gave this a 7.0 speaks wonders for its replayability and below mediocre player experience.  You essentially have to play the same 3 missions three times . Yes, the objectives change and everytime it is made easier for you to complete the mission, but no matter how hard you try to make fun of it (i.e. the characters involved are aware that it is happening again and crack quality jokes about it), it doesn't comfort the player much in knowing that they have to slog through it again. Oh, and there was no final boss fight? Phoque that noise. We also understood that Alan was a writer, so we didn't need to have overwrought prose telling us how he is this bringer of light in so many frivolous ways. We got it. But it just gets me that they thought they could get away me playing those  same three levels and think it would be okay if they slapped a good score and made jokes about it.  This was not the DLC Alan Wake deserved.			",291,42,3,23,15,3,8

												I absolutely loved the original Alan Wake. The first game had an addicting combat system, excellent writing, and an engaging storyline that made me not want to put the controller down. It was the first game that got me hooked on singleplayer story-driven games.So, naturally, I had to buy American Nightmare when it was on sale, and I have to say: had I played this first, I wouldn't have felt the same way.The great combat system is still there, and Arcade Mode utilizes it very well. However, story mode is severely lacking. It's boringly easy (ammo is everywhere) and intentionally repetitive. Literally, the same three locations and the exact objectives are copied and pasted three times to lengthen the game.And don't expect the same enthralling story, either. American Nightmare brings nothing to the table that the original game didn't already do. Unlike in the original, I just didn't care for the characters or the situation they were in. There was nothing particularly memorable that got me hooked.I love Alan Wake, and American Nightmare's Arcade Mode is nice, but I can't help but think this expansion is a blatant cash-in. If you're an Alan Wake fan, just watch a Let's Play of this game and wait for the real sequel.			",116,24,2,3,5,0,6

												This is a direct sequel to the first game. It attempts to explain events directly after the conclusion of the first game and then takes place two years after the events in Bright Falls. To simplify without spoiling too much, Alan is in a sort of limbo (""The Dark Place""), and is desperately trying to get back to the real world (which has written him off for dead), his wife, his friends, and his job.However, the Dark Presence (the bad thing) has taken on Alan's skin and can travel to the real world; it is also actively keeping Alan stuck in the Dark Place while he attempts to ruin Alan's life in the real world by being a massive psychotic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (think serial killer / torturer). You have to get out of the Dark Place, kill the Dark Presence that is imitating you, and get back to life.The only problem is: The Dark Presence can send you back in time to repeat the same thing over and over again, so this experience becomes basically a very, very dark Groundhog Day. Each time you go through the time loop, the people you interact with remember bits and pieces of your last visit, so you slowly untangle the mess.This game is much more action-oriented than the first. There is no danger of running out of ammo, and there are lots more weapons (including heavy stuff like a combat shotgun, all kinds of rifles, automatic weapons, and even a sweet crossbow and nail gun). It's a lot more run-and-gun and much more satisfying in terms of killing bad guys.The story is just as convoluted as the first game, so if you liked the story of the first one, this is a great follow-up to the game. It's much shorter than the first game so it's a fun little 1-2 night wrap-up of the story.There's also an arcade mode with leaderboards where you just get to survive a certain number of waves of Taken while using ammo and weapons scattered around the level. Unlocking weapons in Story mode gets you better gear in Arcade mode.			",219,35,3,32,25,2,30

												The sequel is okay, but not as good. It has an interesting story and a sort of ""Borderland's"" feel graphically wise, it plays out like an episode of Night Springs (in game version of The Twilight Zone) including a voice describing the conundrum. My only real complaint with the sequel is that it's sexist, you interact with only three other characters, all ""well modeled"" women. A buxom mechanic, a cocktail dress/lab coat wearing scientist, and one that's hard for me to describe but a 20-something flannel wearing neophyte who's a little too easy after she was touched by darkness.

												Episodic gaming is hardly a new concept. From Half-Life 2: Episode 1 to Sam & Max Save The World and SiN Episodes, there were many attempts at this format. Alan Wake's American Nightmare is different. Despite being a direct sequel to the original game, it is essentially a self-contained story with a beginning and a satisfying ending. In terms of quality, American Nightmare matches and occasionally surpasses the original. The combat has been improved (there is even an alternative aiming mode offered in the configurations menu); the improved overall feedback as well as the expanded arsenal and creative new foes make the 'fight with light' combat especially enjoyable. The story is the hightlight of American Nightmare, taking full advantage of the episodic format with its clever twist. The dialogue is snappy and frequently genuinely funny. The main antagonist, Mr. Scratch (or Mr. [...] if you prefer), is disturbing and hilarious, often both at once. I am running out of space here. Play it!			",386,109,17,59,33,5,56

												While the game got me excited for a more open ended structure with the wide open skies of the desert setting, it's all just for show. The first game was criticized for being repetitive and this one is actually worse. It has next to no interactivity with it's world and the writing isn't getting any better. It actually forces you to do the same things three times that weren't even fun the first time you did it. The game is content with presenting you with a story, rather than letting the player experience it first hand through interaction and puzzle solving.			",273,80,5,24,17,5,23

												Alan Wake On A BudgetI'd be dissatisfied with this game, but it came cheap, and I get the idea they didn't have a whole lot of resources to work with. The combat re-invigorates Alan Wake's gameplay for the brief time it has, the levels have an interesting mood and tone, but get tedious on repeated play-throughs. The narrative, as communicated through read-aloud onscreen pages is still enjoyable. It makes me hope they make an actual Alan Wake sequel. Like, for an actual system, not the XBONE.Buy it if it's a STEAM sale and you didn't get enough of Alan Wake.			",574,130,6,48,35,2,70

												It's been a long time since I played Alan Wake so I can't compare those two things. That said, I did enjoy this game. It's quite short, I finished it in 4 hours(for the 2€ price it's good deal) but I didn't play all the arcade levels. Arcade is basically survival level and there are ten or more of those.

												This review is based on a some very, very brief game play that you can see on my youtube channel below.The first game scared the hell out of me! The second seems to be more action focused and did not really leave me feeling like I wanted to carry on playing. I am sure that this is a decent game, but was not one for me.

												AWAN improves upon the control and gameplay mechanics of the original game. There are more varied (and more dangerous) enemies and Alan Wake has upped his game to match them. Alan is more nimble, has more endurance, and has a much wider range of tools at his disposal. To put it simply: combat in AWAN is more satisfying than in the original. However, Alan Wake's American Nightmare simply isn't scary. And it's not a story-driven adventure in the sense of the original. The heavily polished scripting of the original has turned into an arcade game, albeit a half decent one. AWAN is a young adult novella to Alan Wake's proper horror story.Fun, but missing the aesthetic magic of the first game.7/10			",266,80,2,68,16,4,49

												I’m assuming that most people playing this game played the original so I’ll focus on comparison between the two titles.  The major difference between the two games is that AW:AN has a stronger focus on combat, with more weapons and more enemy varieties than in the original game.  I found that I enjoyed it more than the original, mainly because the variety of different enemies kept things from becoming as repetitive (as did a shorter run time).  The thing I liked was that a few of the new enemies weren’t just killed in the same way as every other enemy in the series so alternate strategies had to be used.  As this game focuses more on the action, the horror has mostly been taken out of the game since batteries/ammo are easily replenished.  The original AW had a more interesting story, but the story in this game has some neat ideas and a gimmick that keeps things fun and engaging.			",169,46,3,17,14,1,45

												A brief nightmare...Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a third person shooter developed by Remedy (Max Payne and Alan Wake creators). It is a standalone game, set in the 'Alan Wake' Universe. You play as Alan Wake, a writer who has gotten stuck in a television series called 'Night Springs'.The plot doesn't have a significant impact on the original story. Continuing (if somewhat loosly) after the orignal game (specifically the DLC 'The Writer) American Nightmare tells a the story of Alan facing off against his dopple ganger Mr Strange in the fictional country town of Night Springs located in Arizona. There are manuscript pages which serves as an insight on what happened to the characters from the orignal Alan Wake, after the ending (although since the manuscripts are found inside the TV show it is debatable whether the events actually happend outside the TV world or not).Audio is quite good. Aside from some forgettable character's, the majority of the voice acting is great at instilling personality (especially Mr Scratch). Weapons sound decent like the orignal game. There are also some rock music as well which sound great during tesne fights. At non-combat moments, quiet music is played to instill a spooky atmosphere (although not as effective as the in the orignal game).Compared to the original 'Alan Wake', this game has a stronger focus on combat. Like the previous game, you need to shine your flashlight at enemies until the 'shadow dissapears from them before you can damage them with bullets. You can sprint longer than in the previous game as well as removing darkness from the taken faster as well.  There is a variety of weapons available including the familiar ones pistol, carbine, shotgun, flares, flash grenades, to new ones like crossbow, double barrelled shotgun and nailgun.  You only start off with a pistol and flashlight and you need to either find new weapons or unlock them from trunks. Weapon trunks only open when you have collected enough manuscript pages. Unlike the previous game, ammunition is plentiful and is regained through red containers attatched to walls, which also replenish themselves over time. There are also a few recognisable enemies such as the flying objects and the standard goons. New enemies include bird guys (switch between human and bird form), chainsaw guy and spiders (which all have unique attacks). Other parts of the gameplay involves moving around and collecting/activating items to move the plot. There are only 3 areas in the game rest stop, observatory and outdoor cinema area (which compared to the original game is quite small). The areas are split up and not connected like the previous game. You will also go through these areas three times (which can feel a bit cumbersome), although with some different encounters to spice things up. Another issue is that the game is quite short, taking only 4 hours for me to complete (just campaign) compared to the orginal Alana wake, which took 18 hours.There is also a survival mode available. You start with only one stage and you need to collect stars to unlock new stages. Stars are earned based on your score at the end of the stage. To increase your score you need to kill off enemies (which are basically the guys you faced in single player). Enemies come out in waves. At the start of the stage, you only have a flashlight and pistol. New weapons are scattered around the area as well as light sources (which serve as auto-healling). You also need to be awar of your score multiplier which: 1.gradually decreases 2. increases for each kill or successful dodge and 3. Reuces to zero when you get hit by an enemy.If you like more Alan Wake gameplay, namely combat, than get this game. If you wanted a game which is similar to the original Alan Wake ,ie. focuses on plot, you will be dissapointed.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Short version: Not worth buying. Short ( <4 hours if you don't read everything ), bland, and overly simplified. Would be better suited to be a single scenario in the base game rather than a stand alone game.The game itself is very short ( start to finish only took me 4 hours and that was with me exploring and reading all the pages I found ), and ""streamlined"" into being a generic arcade third person shooter that delivers a moderately interesting plot across the same three game areas that forces you to play them three times with only slight variations each time.Gone are the different flashlights - although the one you have is decent.Gone is the need to conserve ammo and batteries - each area has a box that fills all your ammo and batteries even if you are out of everything.Only a few new enemies are introduced - spiders, which are defeated in the same manner as the birds from the original game, an enemy that splits when you shine light on it, and a super-heavy enemy.The plot itself is somewhat interesting from a conceptual standpoint, but the ending has a strong taste of deus ex machina while a majority of the plot consists of you watching Mr. Scratch on various televisions or through live action video.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a standalone mini title in the Alan Wake franchise and a damn good one at that.As a huge fan of the original I can say I had high hopes fort his one despite it being a standalone/mini spin off title and I wasn't dissapointed at 2$ this was an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. The great atmosphere and production values are as high as over being held down well with the fun+very cinematic combat. Interesting mechanics with the light is ,again much like the first game, fun for the first half and hour and quickly burns out to a kind of chore. Without spoiling the game it does get repetitive at times but shouldn't doesn't hold the game back too dramatically.TL:DR More of the same Alan Wake we know and love albiet in a smaller package with a few new features.

												This series certainly took a step forward.The combat is much more acceptable than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the previous presented, and the game is less frustrating from technical reasons. Some of the more infuriating elements were taken out, but I feel like the game has been made easier, since it hasn't quite received a replacement that provides an actual, real challenge (rather than the cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff that made the first game that annoying). The worst you get is a huge enemy that takes a lot to kill and can easily be disposed off from a distance. At one point you actually have to face two of these, which will probably require you to dodge once.The story is average. It uses some time loop thing, and I'll tell you I've seen the time loop subject used very well and disastrously in works. This time, it was used in an annoying way, it could have been worse so I'll just look over it.There's also an arcade mode which is kind of like Resident Evil's Mercenaries mode. Played a bit of it and it could be entertaining, but I won't be bothering with it.Unlike the first game, this one is actually worth a shot.			",196,8,8,19,2,0,4

												Very different from the original Alan Wake. I wasn't expecting it to be this when I first played. It is more of an action arcade game than a thriller adventure of the first one. It is still very fun, but I wouldn't consider it a sequel to the original game. It is more of a spinoff with a few gameplay improvements on the original. The news about a potential sequel has been off and on throughout the years, but I hope that a true sequel to Alan Wake will be made eventually...			",76,8,0,12,1,0,2

												A very nice change of pace when compared to the first Alan Wake. Game now focuses on fighting (flashlight + gun combo) instead of slowly engulfing the player in the dark mists of the story. If you're looking for a thriller like the original Alan Wake, look elsewhere. If you're looking for the great fighting mechanic that was just a part of the Alan Wake experience this is the place to go! Playing American Nightmare without knowing the original storyline will make the plot extremely hard to understand but if you know what happened to Alan, it's a very nice ending.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worth the sale price, maybe not full price, because it is a quick play, only about 8 hours in it, less if you power through games and don't tend to wander around a bit like I do.  I was iffy at one point, but then saw what was going on and by the end I had completely enjoyed the experience.  I never played the original Alan Wake, and this may have been designed with vets in mind so I was slow on the uptake, but even with that it was quite fun.  You can blow through and just do it action style, or listen to all the radio shows and watch all the TV clips and really get into the story, and/or look for all the lost pages/unlocks.  Used up an otherwise worthless day nicely, and I almost felt like I'd read a book at the same time.			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

												Well this is a nice little spin-off of Alan Wake. Liked the story, the combat with new weaponry (some remind of Max Payne which is tasty :)), the Arizona environments, the cutscenes (beautiful live action in HD :P). Mr. Scratch is a great antagonist. Would like to see more of him. The new enemies are pretty well done too.Shame that it contains  only few environments that just repeat as you progress through the story mode. There are some changes of course.  And there are a few fetch quests which to me mean boredom.The atmosphere is certainly different from Alan Wake. Less darkness, more casual action. Not that big of a deal since Alan Wake wasn't the scaries game either but the difference is visible. The difficulty is weird but basicly not very high. There is a bunch of new pages to find and I like how everything expands on Alan´s original story. He certainly has some crap to work through. Then there is the arcade mode. I usually don´t care about wave based survival modes like this, but this one I enjoyed. The nightmare difficulty certainly can be a challenge.To finish it off, I did have a good time with this one and certainly don´t regret buying it. But the crossbow is really op :P.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare has a fantastic use of sound design and level design, but it's flaws stick out like a sore thumb. The game is painfully short and very much like an arcade zombie shooting game with of course, more interactivity. This game had incredible potential but it fell short for me. I still think it is very atmospheric and worth a buy for it's atmosphere.			",130,11,0,3,3,1,2

												What a waste of my time. I'm rather glad I got this and Alan Wake in a bundle for something like a dollar before, because this game's production quality seems to be worth about that much. It's literally the same three stages that you play through three times with the exact same mission objectives. The NPCs are gaudy and insulting to the player, especially for something that's supposed to be in the lines of the Alan Wake universe. I really can't believe someone thought this would be a good idea for a DLC/expansion or something. Dreadful.			",107,10,6,4,11,2,10

												If the first game's story was silent hill oriented, this DLC is Siren oriented. Can't say I enjoyed this one as much as the original game. The game felt more action based rather than Survival Horror. You'll find full ammo restock in certain places so there's no fear running out of ammo, which is bad as a surv. horror genre. The original was a psychological horror this one felt more psycho thriller. This DLC was a good way to close the original game though.			",343,62,0,39,13,3,23

												American Nightmare drops the repetition from its predecessor by adding new weapons and types of enemies to mix things up with, and its plot makes clever use of the same three locations in a number of ways. The actual gameplay is as solid as ever, and the storyline, though shorter, is just as well-written, with a more personable foe in the form of Alan's nemesis, Mr. Scratch. However, it may be an issue to you that this one is nowhere near as scary as the original Alan Wake, and feels more like an action game.			",210,26,0,15,9,0,14

												Overall Score: 7/10My advice: Wait 'til it drops under $7.50, only if you've played the first one.Genre: Action/Survival HorrorAs a small, semi-sequel to the original Alan Wake, AW:AN doesn't disappoint... much. For the $10 price tag, it's got enough content to keep you for a while. It's only about 6 hours long if you stop and get all the collectables, and Nightmare mode is difficult enough that I wasn't just breezing through every map. The arcade mode is also quite entertaining, but the enjoyment doesn't last. Story was the real reason the first game did well, and without it, the game's a little stale.There's a somewhat interesting plot to story mode, which kept me mostly intrigued, and the familiar Alan Wake combat system is back, with only a few new enemies and guns. That's part of the reason I'm hesitant to call this a sequel... It's really just a new, small chapter of Alan Wake to tide the audience over for the next game, if there is one. If the game drops below $7.50, I'd snag it. Was worth the time and effort. Be warned though, some of those achievements are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get.			",455,127,7,69,23,6,41

												The campaign seemed a bit short and after a while I felt like I was doing chores instead of progressing the story, but overall it was solid DLC. The overhaul of the flashlight system isn't really good or bad, but the classic campaign weapons got a serious reworking and they added a ton of new ones to boot.  They also added a lot more ammo—too much actually. Sure I ran out of ammo a few times but that was because I never bothered to run away or conserve—there was no need to. I could just stand around blasting Taken until my heart’s content and then go to the restock station. It really took away from the feel of the original game; not needing to ever really worry if you have enough to make it to the next checkpoint. Arcade mode is actually quite fun and a great option if you want to play something but don’t really want to get too involved. If you want to use any of the new weapons in Arcade mode, you need to play though the campaign as you now collect manuscript pages to unlock the new weapons.			",90,8,1,10,3,0,2

												Just plain annoying, the ""proper"" Alan Wake game is soo good i bought it on both Xbox (plus all dlc) and the PC, this version is seriously low on content to the point that it only has a few levels and makes you replay them 3 times as part of a ""time loop"" story line. I cant help feeling that the time loop story line was thought up just to extend the play time a little.I HATE games where i have to redo a level, usually because i died or did something wrong, it punishes the player, imagine how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off i felt the first time this game put be back at the beguining, well just because that is its apparent story line..You can imagine how i felt when it performed the same trick again :(Even as i watched the end game movie i was expecting to be put back at the start.To think i postponed my PC playthrough of the main Alan Wake game to play this first, is frankly annoying as ♥♥♥♥.

Gameplay stays the same as the original.The story mode can be completed in under 4 hours. That is a wee bit bad, since it is a stand-alone title. If it was a DLC, it would have been a good excuse. Even if the graphics still makes you ""wow!"", the story is a bit less gripping and the overall trapped-in-a-nightmare feeling mixed with horror is not really there.This game is between okay and good.

												This is a fun follow-up to the original Alan Wake. The combat is actually more fun in this one and each combat sequence seems to actually have a sense of purpose. The game itself felt fairly short but the story did pick up where the first game left off and I was pleased with the way it all turned out. Although you can technically play this game without having experiencing the story of the first, I recommend you don't because there are quite a few spoilers since the story takes place about two years after the original. Still, if you just want a fairly quick single-player experience to run through, this game shouldn't take more than a day to complete. I certainly felt a sense of satisfaction when I beat it!

												Not the greatest game but unlike alot of ppl I didn't think it was awful. I mean, its basically a DLC and DLC's are well basic. At least they showed through the game why its short and has three levels redone. The story is still good, and the music is epic. It's only issue is that its extremely easy. Even though it adds cooler weapons and enemies it really is far too easy. It's not scary but that doesn't make it any less. Don't pay alot for it, but still you should play it if you love Alan Wake which I know you do. Plus it'll help if you plan on buying Alan Wake 2 like I do!P.S. the nail gun sucks lol			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare was a great game to play.In comparison to the first- not everything is clouded in darkness, there are way more guns, the engine as a whole feels much, MUCH, more polished and fluid. There are also live action cut scenes which I thought were awesome!! I felt it brought the characters to life in a fun and authentic feeling way. The characters for Mr. Scratch, Alan, and Alice all looked very, very similar to their in-game rendered model.Starting with the guns & fighting: You now have multiple small arms and multiple long arms, similar to the 2 weapon slots in the first game. For small arms you have a nail gun, either an uzi or mac10, revolver, and 9mm semiauto. Long guns had the double barrel & pump shotguns, an M16, M4A1, crossbow, and hunting rifle. These are the ones I can remember off the top of my head, there may have been a few more, and a few I didn't unlock. The guns feel fairly good shooting, ammo was much too plentiful in the game as there are caches of ammo & batteries for the flashlight all over the place as you play. The flashlight was also changed in American Nightmare to no longer give the constant damage to the enemies's shield, handy when you're low or facing a single enemy, now you have to boost the flashlight to do any shield damage. The flashlight recharges super fast, however, and I rarely, rarely used batteries compared to the first game (also no flashlight upgrades).The enemies in this game were not too difficult, most still had shields and they actually made a few enemies have different mechanics than the first game which was greatly appreciated. The process of burning down the shield and plinking at the same human silhouettes got old quickly in the first. This introduces enemies who fly around as crows and turn into humans, attempting to ambush and avoid your gun fire, enemies who split if you focus your flashlight on them, and even spiders who die by gun fire or light, no shield made of darkness.Where the first game had great settings and characters, the 2nd falls flat. There are 3 locations for the whole game which was intended for the story, but man was it boring. Luckily each time you revisit a location the tasks at hand are fast forwarded a bit so you spend a lot less time in each area upon returning. There were 3 intractable characters you worked with during the game: a mechanic Emma (boring and over sexualized in appearance), an astrologer/scientist Dr. Rachel Meadows (also over sexualized in appearance), and a theater attendant/film maker named Serena (this time over sexualized via EXTREMELY sIutty dialogue). Mr. Scratch, your bestie, is the 4th character you really do anything with and he's pretty freakin funny in this game, I got a kick out of his♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bagginess and his bad guy antics.I did not play nor had any interest in the survival/arena mode which seems to be a highlight in this game.To sum up AW vs AL:AN- Alan Wake has a better setting, story, and characters. Alan Wake: American Nightmares has a better game engine, graphics, guns, and enemies.I recommend both, it's just too bad they couldn't get the best of both games together.			",148,39,0,19,9,1,23

												For the most part, Alan Wake's American Nightmare shares many of the same positives as the original Alan Wake. But there are some improvements. For one, the combat is much smoother than in the first one, it just seems to run better. But it also seems to be a tad bit easier, but that could just be the difficulty setting I chose (I chose normal, but there is no ""Easy"" in AN like there was in Alan Wake, making the Normal the easier of the two difficulty options). They've also done away with many of the horror-esque elements. I'd classify this as a thriller, more than anything else. All in game cut scenes have also been replaced with live-action ones, which I thought was very interesting. They're were well done too. The game does well as a stand alone, providing good closure for the events of the previous game, whilst simultaneously giving sufficient background information to those who haven't played the original. An afternoon well spent in my book. Pick it up if you enjoyed the original, or if you need something short, sweet, and very good to play.			",178,53,2,20,9,0,29

												More guns, more explosions, more enemies, and it all feels oh so good. The graphics are even more improved than last time, leaving no corner untouched in its dusty atmosphere, and the solid music from last time has returned. Yet the best elements of the original game, the level design and story, don't shine nearly as well here. The story is much more vague and loose compared to the first's thoroughly concentrated tale. It isn't bad (nor quite as good), but it leaves many things that were most likely left open for the promised true sequel to fill in. Further to its benefit, the great acting has returned with a interesting new usage of surprisingly well done live action cutscenes. On the other hand the level design has gone through the blender and come out as a pitiful shred of its former self. Blatantly put, the game has three main open areas that you go through three separate times with little variation, it’s artificial lengthening of the absolute worst kind. What a letdown.

Great SeriesI'm a big fan of action adventure games and this fit the bill. I found it to be a solid game with a great storyline. The combat leaves something to be desired, but which game doesn't (Silent Hill)American Nightmare is definitely repetitive, you'll see what I mean, but it ties into the story so it's not too bad.You won't regret buying this title.

												First off, it's pretty short. It took me 5 hours. You're guided most of the way, so you can't really draw it out. it's a lot easier than the first, if you played that one. I think I died 3 times, and that's it. Ammunition is plentiful in this go round, and the flashlight charges really quickly. It has mostly the same elements: manuscripts, videos to watch and audio to listen to. If you really liked the first, you might like this one as well. It's very story driven, intersperced with you doing missions and killing bad guys. There's an interesting twist in the story line that goes on just long enough. If you're thinking about buying the first, it wouldn't hurt to get this one and play it beforehand, if it was cheap enough. it's a nice primer.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A few remarks before I begin:- Alan Wake is a concept I very much love- Alan Wake's American Nightmare is the 'Sequel' to Alan WakeAll that said, I'm sure you can understand why I was a little disappointed with this game. It's a sequel. If it were just a disappointing game, it would score lower. But it's a sequel, and so all but doomed to be not as good as the first. It's shorter than the first game by a great deal, which is fair, considering it was meant to, but the story mode is lacking. It has you play the same scenarios three times IN A ROW, with a little variation. The story behind this is sound, as would be expected from a story about a writer, but it still feels wooden regardless. Or, indeed, like the developers got bored and thought, 'Hmm, how can we get this to market in the next eight seconds?'. Also, with no change to gaming mechanic, this lack of emphasis on story compared to the first one makes it feel a lot more like a mindless shooter. And I generally dislike mindless shooters, especially ones that give you what is essentially horde mode - and then don't add multiplayer, thus rendering it pointless.6.5/10. Just missed a 6 by being an Alan Wake game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be perfectly honest i was suprised by this game. Sadly in a negative way. American Nightmere continues the story of titled writer. This time he gets stuck in a horror movie that he used to make scenarios for, called Night Springs.  Intro movie displays a viewer that fell asleep while the program was on. Results are the same for the player. Developers got an idea to use a time twist physics theory. It allowed them to literally recycle thir product multiple times. Only three maps exist in the game and the only major difference is amount of enemies. This in turn leads to runing out of ammo in the late game, causing multiple, frustrating deaths in row due to lack of melee combat option.Combat itself is limited to blinding enemies with flashlight which causes them to stop moving and become vunerable for bulletsAll this increases the lenght of the game, it dosenät help much though becouse it took me only 1,5 h to complete whole game.Luckly the developers had enough reason to remove same aleready done objectives every time i repeated the map, so it aint a complete disaster. Plot of the game is very similar to another title ""Cryostasis"", With different location and few combat differenses. For examle you will fight darknes zombies with light and firearms, instead of ice zombies with heat and firearms.Ending is also quite predictable and resembles cheap horror movies from 1970:s . It causes no satisfaction and makes the whole game being made just for purpose of shooting things and thus moneymaking instead of focusing on quality.    ",84,14,0,26,18,0,9

												Brilliant game! I paid just a bit under $10 for the Alan Wake bundle. At the time, the first Alan Wake was selling individually for $7.50 which means this game was pretty much under $3. And I had no idea what this was. I thought it was just a silly arcade survival add-on (in which it does have that mode). But it is a full on game that continues the story of the first, or at least tries to explain more.It was worth every friggen cent! I actually liked this better than the first game. But at the same time you need to play the first to understand what is happening story-wise and how the game engine mechanics have evolved.The artwork was great, the story was unique (making good use of the open world), I absolutely loved the soundtrack, the SFX of the guns sounded powerful, the satellite crash, the gameplay, the funny TV and radio shows ...

												Alan Wake's American NightmareIt still has that creepy feeling of Alan Wake and was fun to complete, but it is much shorter than Alan Wake. There are some new guns to use and some new enemies to keep you at your wits end. My favorite thing from this game was the songs, the song from Kasabian was really nice and I loved the song from the fictional band, The Old Gods of Asgard ""Balance slays the demon"" and ""The Happy Song"", a song aimed directly at Mr Scratch.8/10Welcome to Night Springs			",218,55,3,29,19,5,29

												Not the greatest game but unlike alot of ppl I didn't think it was awful. I mean, its basically a DLC and DLC's are well basic. At least they showed through the game why its short and has three levels redone. The story is still good, and the music is epic. It's only issue is that its extremely easy. Even though it adds cooler weapons and enemies it really is far too easy. It's not scary but that doesn't make it any less. Don't pay alot for it, but still you should play it if you love Alan Wake which I know you do. Plus it'll help if you plan on buying Alan Wake 2 like I do!P.S. the nail gun sucks lol			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												American Nightmare kicks off right after Alan Wake, so you should really play that first. That said, American Nightmare fixes some of the problems with the original in terms of enemy and weapon variety, but doesn't really do a great deal with level design. If you can deal with that, it's a pretty engaging sequel. I do have to say that the antagonist of American Nightmare is way more interesting than whoever it was in the original. He'll either come across as campy or really unsettling; probably both.It's not as Stephen King-y as the original; it's split off to do its own thing, and I think it does it pretty well.

												This is a stan-alone dlc for the main game Alan Wake. With this in mind it obviously will have a shorter storyline, around 4 hrs. Still the storyline is interesting and satisfying, with a good ending. The game has added a whole new amount of weapons which is great and refreshing from the older guns. Wide range of enemies as well with more new enemies that keep it interesting and challenging through the game. Voice acting is done well but when talking to characters they don't move or show really any emotion, which makes it hard to connect to them. They introduced a new unlockable feature witch introduces an ever wider range of guns. The arcade mode supplies more replayability and is good fun, but not entirely challenging but you can unlock new levels as you progress. 8.5/10 Great storyline, fresh ideas and an arcade mode that will keep you interested. Sadly, being a stand-alone dlc, it is short, round 4 hrs			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While this game isn't as solid as an experience as the original Alan Wake, there are more weapons and an arcade styled horde mode about surviving until the morning (which essentially just means kill as many enemies in 10 minutes for the most points you can muster). The story mode is where this game will disappoint, as it reuses each level with minor differences multiple times (with the excuse that you are stuck repeating your past night like the movie Groundhog Day). Not the best third-person shooter, but for fans of the original looking for more Alan Wake action, then you can find enjoyment here.			",410,89,6,34,27,6,44

												American Nightmare improves greatly upon its predecessor in terms of combat and environmental variety. It’s also got a pretty cool spin-off “groundhog day” thing going on at the expense of getting fatigued from running through the same areas over and over. Unfortunately, you’d be hard pressed to find this scary in any way and the over-abundance of ammo kills any survival element the original had. It’s not episodic like the first, but it’s also on the very short side.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story in this spin-off is much weaker than in the main game and the fact you revisit the locations several times over and over again isn't too great either. But this game has got its strenghts: Finally the combat is responsive! It's even really fun. A much wider arsenal of weapons and way more enemies. I'd recommend it if you like playing survival modes. Other than that, there isn't much content here. As a nice gimmick this game tells you a few small details of what happened after the main game. Beware of playing this one before the main game, if you are interested in the story as it might spoil it for you quite heavily!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Es war ein regnerischer Tag als ich das erste Mal ""Alan Wake´s American Nightmare"" gestartet hatte. Es war dunkel und der Charakter erhob sich zum ersten Mal aus dem Dreck. Wir starten das Spiel mit einer Taschenlampe und einer Pistole. Man versteht schnell wie es funktioniert: Taschenlampe auf den Gegner, warten, schießen. Jeder Gegner in diesem Spiel lässt sich auf diese Weise ohne Probleme erledigen. Die Steuerung und die Grafik haben mir gefallen. Kommen wir nun zum eigentlichem Problem von Alan Wake´s American Nightmare, man steht wie ich schon sagte aus dem Dreck auf, erledigt Aufgaben (Dreh das Ventil zu, mach dies, mach das) und kommt durch 4 verschiedene Level die zu einem Showdown mit sich selbst führen. Ja, man kämpft gegen sein böses Ich. Leider hat ""ALAN"" aber etwas vergessen, also steht er wieder am Start auf. Ich lachte  und dachte mir:"" Na, was kommt jetzt"". Richtig, das ganze Spiel nochmal, mit geringen Abweichungen. Als ich dann endlich wieder beim Endgegner angekommen war und das Spiel nun zwei mal gesehen hatte passierte das Unvorstellbare. Ich stand wieder am Anfang. Mir standen bereits die Haare zu Berge, da der Charakter scheinbar immer wieder Teile zu vergessen scheint. Man sieht also wieder die gleichen Leute und die gleichen Orte, mit nur geringen Abweichungen in den Aufgaben. Den Rest kennt ihr ja und ihr wacht wieder auf. Dann spielt ihr das ganze nochmal, und fertig. Spiel vorbei. Spielzeit? Unter 4 Stunden. War es die 10,00-15,00€ Wert? Nein. Für 15,00€ hätte ich auch zwei mal ins Kino gehen können, und zwar für UNTERSCHIEDLICHE Filme.			",67,9,6,2,29,0,8

												Alan Wake is one of my favorite games of all time.  I found myself fully engrossed in every bit of that game.  The story itself was the merry result of a fruitful marriage of Twin Peaks, X-Files and Lost with a bit of Stephen King threw in for good measure.  This game is much less story-driven and much more action-driven which I didn't care for.  It's also insanely short.  I beat the game in about 5 hours.  It feels like more of an expansion pack.  It isn't exactly a sequel, and it's not a prequel, just a weird little thing set in the same universe somehow.  Also because a time-loop is a story point, you end up playing all the areas about three times and I grew bored of it easily.			",220,38,6,15,8,3,20

I appreciated the contrast in characters and some of the real-life imagery was a nice touch. But the whole experience litterally kept you visiting the same locations and repeating the same tasks. The plot revolves around finding one additional detail through each run but it came across as a cheap atempt to lengthen the game.			",215,48,6,22,25,1,35

												I am a huge fan of Alan Wake but this game was big disappointment. This DLC was part of Alan-Wake-Franchise at Steam. I have played it. Its not bad, but it has not much in common with the original Game. Alan Wake really doesn't have much more than a flashlight, a gun and, occasionally, a flashbang. So if you tried the original dont bother trying this game.			",131,21,1,10,6,0,12

												this game is a much needed metaphor inthe USA as it critically evaluates the american dream. in fact, it's implied with a title that is a parody of the dream conjured by MLK before his greatest performance ever (critics still to this day are still salty that he went against magic regulations and did not include a prestige in the end).a white man is living a carefree life beating up the homeless and being an all-around allstar trash mvp human being in general, when a ""tragic"" event happens that smashes him facelong with reality. the rest of the game is a battle within his mind to find first-world ideas of superiority and defeat them by closely examining their sources and impacts upon other societal groups not inclusive within his cultural (white) hegemony. it is the path every american must take to be at peace with themselves and the world around them. it has recieved great reviews because it undoes the brainwashing that rap music and mcdonalds has enforced upon the nation. no longer will a parent worry about their childs upbringing glued to a television set. simply have them play this psychological treatment in the form of clever gamification to output healthy, curious individuals.

												The Champion of Light is back and better than ever in this expansion. I would definitely recommend playing the original Alan Wake first, as it's a great game with an intriguing and engrossing story, but American Nightmare is just plain fun. It doesn't have quite the survival horror feel of the original; a hugely expanded arsenal of weapons makes defeating Taken a pleasure rather than a struggle. The option to turn off motion blur is the single greatest change between the two games, and it makes American Nightmare much more enjoyable. The story is still mysterious, and I was amazingly gratified at its beautiful conclusion, even though Alan's fate is still uncertain. The arcade mode is a nice addition and a great example of a survival mode that is difficult yet winnable.			",103,28,1,4,2,2,18

												It's an ok sequil to the original, but it just feels different. It's much shorter, has very little horror elements, and is much more combat oriented. Many of the core elements of the original (the manuscript pages and other collectables, shining the light on enemies to weaken them, etc.) have been dumbed down considerably. There are a couple of new enemies that I found really interesting (the Splitter and the Birdman) and an interesting twist on gameplay. The live-action cut-scenes were pretty cool, as well. It's kind of got a Mario 3 motif to it and it doesn't bring the story to any more of a closure than the original did. If it's cheap, pick it up, but I wouldn't really recommend full price for it.

												What first seemed to be an ironically bad bonus story soon turns into a well written turn of events that rounds everything up from the original game perfectly. The arcade mode is a good challenge making use of all of the new weapons and taken like bursting into birds guy and stop ruining my multiplier grenade dude. Still plenty of interesting collectables despite being much shorter, the manuscripts are a good read but I'm most impressed with the TVs showing Mr Scratch acting all American Psycho.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare is the shorter expansion pack style follow up to the previous entry - Alan Wake. Utilising a more arcade-y gameplay style this time, the game features shorter stage style locations with a heavier focus on combat and a vastly expanded collection of weaponry. The gameplay is much smoother this time around to make the fights feel more fluid and energetic, this does detract from the eerie atmosphere somewhat, with Alan feeling more powerful than ever (to be fair he would be pretty battle hardened by now though) and the enemies being easier to take down it is hard to feel overwhelmed, which does detract from the horror side of things. Storywise the game features a less intricate plot - The general overview is the doppelganger of Alan created from the ending of the first game - Mr. Scratch - is on the lose and attempting to destroy everything important to Alan and he must stop him before that happens. Overall Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a great bite sized action thriller with plenty of replayability.			",109,15,4,18,7,0,12

												Combat is a weak combination of holding down right-click for a varying amount of time, and then spamming left-click until the enemy fades away in a yellow flash.

												This game is like the Twilight Zone in every aspect. The atmosphere, the narrator, and the gameplay. Don't listen to the cats that say this game is boring and repetative, I enjoyed every moment of it, and would play it again. The Combat is entertaining and pretty easy which means you wont die half the time. The game itself is short, even if you get the achievements and collectables in the game you probably will have four hours on it total. Overall I give this game 10/10 for its great atmosphere and presentation like a Twilight Zone episode.			",56,2,0,3,1,0,6

												Although this is standalone DLC, there really wouldn't be much point playing it without playing the main game as you'd be missing a whole lot of story. American Nightmare still has a similar method of storytelling as the main game, and now features a truly psychotic villain. Now assuming you've played Alan Wake, here's what's new in American Nightmare. There are several new enemies with unique abilities. Several new weapons. A slightly modified HUD which has a more modern look to it. There is only 1 type of flashlight. Batteries fully recharge in about 2 seconds. Ammo is no longer scarce, with ammo boxes that completely resupply you with ammo and batteries. These boxes also replenish after a couple of minutes. Since you have more ammo, you will also be fighting more enemies at any given time. The overall game has a more action-arcade feel to it. There is even an arcade mode where you fight waves of enemies and then get a score with leaderboards support.Bottom Line: If you liked Alan Wake, you need to get this game. ",133,21,3,12,9,0,9

												The original Alan Wake, whats to say an amazing story and good gamplay, overall good game. Now American Nightmare is a little different, diviating off the main story the game has you fighting the darkness and Mr. Scrath. Now many people are put off by the main story itself because of its diviation from the first game, but the story is still a great experiance, with well thought out events and interesting weapons. Now the story is a bit repetitious visiting the same three areas three times and doing the same things. One main seller for me is the arcade mode fighting wave after wave of the darkness untill dawn is a good mechanic, however one dissapointment is that it is not co-op. Now the manuscript pages actually have a use the more pages you collect you can get special wepons in the story and arcade. My opinion is this game matches my expectaitions after it was released and i recomend it to anyone who wants fun fast paced semi-horror shooters.			",208,12,1,14,8,1,8

Very addictive slick gameplay.Graphics the game is very well presented with a great art style & the audio is top notch for £6.99 this game is worth owning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*This review will contain some spoilers for the story of Alan Wake, as well as some gameplay spoilers for American Nightmare. Read at your own disgression!* Alan Wake´s American Nightmare is a spinoff-title to the original Alan Wake. While it shares a lot of similarities with its predecessor, there is a notable amount of changes and new stuff that one should be aware before considering playing it, as these changes and additions will decide whether this game works for you or not.The story takes place within an episode of the TV show ""Night Springs"" (basically the Twilight Zone of Videogames). Alan, still trapped within the Darkness of the Lake after the end of the first game (and its DLC, to be more precise), has now been trapped within one of his own stories, by none other than his doppelgänger, Mr. Scratch. Caught in a loop of endless repetition and constant torment by Scratch, Alan has to find a way to ""break the circle"" and return to the real world before his doppelgänger has completely overtaken his ""real"" life.The gameplay of American Nightmare, at first glance, is basically the same as it was in Alan Wake: You run around in comparatively small, open areas, defeat Taken, collect manuscript pages to fill in story details, and solve some (very easy) puzzles or try and reach a certain spot to advance the story, while occacionally watching TV, listening to the radio and talking to a handful of people. This all takes place on three maps: A Gas Station/Motel in the middle of the Arizonian Desert, an Observatory, and a Drive-in Theater. While each map is quite distinct from the others, you also have to revisit each map several times over the course of the game. While this is explained and justified quite well within the story, this still means that two-thirds of the campaign are repeated content (minor changes notwithstanding). Thankfully, the actual gameplay is good enough so that one can look past it.American Nightmare, gameplay-wise, improves on both Alan Wake´s enemy design and weapon selection. While the regular Taken are still the bread-and-butter of your combat enemies, there are also various new enemy types that demand some different strategies from the usual ""shine your light on them, destroy their shield, and then shoot them"". This includes Taken that are immune to your flashlight and instead split into smaller versions of themselves, Taken that flee by transforming into bird flocks, and Taken that throw ""Darkness Grenades"" into your direction, but keep their distance, among other enemy types. To counter them, Alan now also has access to a much larger arsenal, which gets unlocked the more manuscript pages you collect, so even if you don´t care about the story at all, you should still keep your eyes open for them. The new arsenal includes pistols, a SMG, an Assault Rifle, a Combat Shotgun, a crossbow which ignores the enemy shield, and a Nailgun, among others. Some stuff from Alan Wake also makes a return, like the flaregun and the flashbangs, but they have become quite a bit weaker, no longer insta-killing anything, but rather destroying their shields quickly (which is still useful, of course).The gameplay in general is alot less ""survival"" and much more action-orientated. You will pretty much never run out of ammo or flashlight batteries, individual enemies are alot less threatening than they used to but appear in bigger numbers, and there is alot less general ""creepiness"" in wandering around the desert (though that may just be me). The game, in all fairness, also doesn´t try to be a horror game, unless you count the psychological ""threat to your very existence, a doppelgänger overtaking your life"" angle. In that regard, your occasional encounters with Mr. Scratch are fun, he´s quite a cool and fun, if decidedly hammy, villain, but there´s unfortunately no fight against him, or any boss fight at all, for that matter, which feels like a wasted opportunity, given the more arcade-y gameplay.Once you´re done with the campaign, there´s also an Arcade Mode, in which you have to survive a certain amount of time on various maps while fending off enemies, raising your combo meter (by killing enemies and evading their attacks) and getting enough points to earn stars and unlock new and more difficult maps. Its quite fun (and more difficult than the main campaign ever gets), but probably not something that you will play for more than a few hours.Overall, I personally would recommend American Nightmare, especially if it´s at a discount. If you liked Alan Wake overall, but disliked its gameplay, you will probably like it. If you didn´t like Alan Wake or aren´t interested in the franchise at all, I would still say that you should check it out, but the game will probably not change your overall opinion on the series.

												Alan Wake set an amazing standard in terms of unique gameplay and story, but American Nightmare fails to keep up with this standard. While AN's action soars above AW, it lacks the story that AW provided, as well as a sense of dread and hopelessness you get in AW.AN in itself is fun and different, but not recommended at full price.

												Yeah, it's not bad. Not really a stand-alone title or sequel. More like a glorified DLC. Fun, but not very challenging. And it's more of a shooter than horror than the original Alan Wake, although even then calling the first AW a horror is a bit loose.			",114,17,0,9,19,0,21

												Very twilight zone vibe and that is the major selling point of the game.There are only three levels, the hotel, observatory and drive in cinema. All of which you play though three times each in a ground hogs day style time loop.It is exacuted better than it sounds, but you cant shake the feeling like it was only meant to extend the length of the game.There is a horde mode (Like every game seems to have now a days) which is simple but fun.

												This is a fun follow-up to the original Alan Wake. The combat is actually more fun in this one and each combat sequence seems to actually have a sense of purpose. The game itself felt fairly short but the story did pick up where the first game left off and I was pleased with the way it all turned out. Although you can technically play this game without having experiencing the story of the first, I recommend you don't because there are quite a few spoilers since the story takes place about two years after the original. Still, if you just want a fairly quick single-player experience to run through, this game shouldn't take more than a day to complete. I certainly felt a sense of satisfaction when I beat it!

												To be perfectly honest i was suprised by this game. Sadly in a negative way. American Nightmere continues the story of titled writer. This time he gets stuck in a horror movie that he used to make scenarios for, called Night Springs.  Intro movie displays a viewer that fell asleep while the program was on. Results are the same for the player. Developers got an idea to use a time twist physics theory. It allowed them to literally recycle thir product multiple times. Only three maps exist in the game and the only major difference is amount of enemies. This in turn leads to runing out of ammo in the late game, causing multiple, frustrating deaths in row due to lack of melee combat option.Combat itself is limited to blinding enemies with flashlight which causes them to stop moving and become vunerable for bulletsAll this increases the lenght of the game, it dosenät help much though becouse it took me only 1,5 h to complete whole game.Luckly the developers had enough reason to remove same aleready done objectives every time i repeated the map, so it aint a complete disaster. Plot of the game is very similar to another title ""Cryostasis"", With different location and few combat differenses. For examle you will fight darknes zombies with light and firearms, instead of ice zombies with heat and firearms.Ending is also quite predictable and resembles cheap horror movies from 1970:s . It causes no satisfaction and makes the whole game being made just for purpose of shooting things and thus moneymaking instead of focusing on quality.    ",84,14,0,26,18,0,9

												Alan Wake's American NightmareIt still has that creepy feeling of Alan Wake and was fun to complete, but it is much shorter than Alan Wake. There are some new guns to use and some new enemies to keep you at your wits end. My favorite thing from this game was the songs, the song from Kasabian was really nice and I loved the song from the fictional band, The Old Gods of Asgard ""Balance slays the demon"" and ""The Happy Song"", a song aimed directly at Mr Scratch.8/10Welcome to Night Springs			",218,55,3,29,19,5,29

												Not the greatest game but unlike alot of ppl I didn't think it was awful. I mean, its basically a DLC and DLC's are well basic. At least they showed through the game why its short and has three levels redone. The story is still good, and the music is epic. It's only issue is that its extremely easy. Even though it adds cooler weapons and enemies it really is far too easy. It's not scary but that doesn't make it any less. Don't pay alot for it, but still you should play it if you love Alan Wake which I know you do. Plus it'll help if you plan on buying Alan Wake 2 like I do!P.S. the nail gun sucks lol			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												Where can I begin? I love this game. It's significantly more combat-oriented than it's predecessor which, in some ways, is nice although it shifts the genre of the game from horror to survival. However, the game remains charming in itself and tells a new story in it's new theme. Scratch is possibly one of the best and most likeable villains I have come across and I sorely want to see more of him and his manic, devil-may-care attitude about murder and ruining lives. The environments are fun and the upgrades well-placed; I never found the game particularly hard or particularly easy, but just comfortable enough to enjoy the short little novela of the story. It's a satisfying taste of our beloved story and hugely out of shape, byronic hero until Alan Wake 2 is made.			",170,67,0,28,13,0,15

												Though American Nightmare can be completed within 6 hours, the game itself is a great addition to Remedy's ""Alan Wake"". Sure, it doesn't really tie into the main story but it doesn't make it less fun. The main story in this game does get repetitive at times as you will go into each area a few times throughout the story (for reasons I shall not explain due to spoilers) but the new arcade mode is very fun and the change in combat pace, new weapons, better and smoother visuals and overhauled HUD will get your interest immediately. Overall, it's a good title and I'd recommend it but a word of advice: don't expect something on par with the original Alan Wake. It's not that long and neither as deep but it's fun while it lasts.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A sequel to Alan Wake?! Must be pretty sweet cause the first one knocked it out of the park.Meh.........kinda, a little bit of good a little bit of bad.Im leaning more towards positive with this one because it piggy backs off of the first Alan Wake's story. (which is amazing, go buy that s h i t)Lemme first start off saying it draws you in fast, with an awesome thriller/ action game with a few twists.But then as i think im gonna get the main bad guy (Mr. S*/*/*tch, screeching noise) I do some back to the future part I, II, and III♥♥♥♥♥♥and end right back at the start again.Im thinking dafuq?I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the small size of the envionments, and i was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at how much that dead  horse in the middle of the street was beaten sensless beyond all manners of humanity over and over again. If you dont get my meaning THIS GAME IS SO REPETITIVE IT MAKES ME WANT TO HURL.Its like the Devs ran out of money a quarter of the way through the game and had to pull one out of their a s s es. Which bravo by the way Devs  you got my money. You sick scumbags.You see the same eventsYou see the same envionementsYou see the exact same♥♥♥♥♥♥ over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and .You getting the picture yet? Good.The originality of the flavor was gone in under an hour.I managed to sit through the monotony long enough to see the end. (only 3 hours in?  are you f*****g kidding me?)But when you get past that, the ending to the story of alan wake is what saves this in its entirety.But if you cant get past that your warning is listed below.WARNING!!!!: The gameplay in this game irresponsibly drives a bulldozer of DGAFS all over the face originality and creativity.Seriously though wtf?

This has to be the laziest thing I have ever seen being sold, thankfully it is non-cannon and I can forget about it upon uninstalling. This Twilight Zone of a mess takes place in Arizona, three tiny areas that you got to over and over and over again, doing the same thing over and over and over again stuck in a Groundhog Day plot device. Even with repeat areas it still took me less than three hours to complete this finding all the secrets. They even tacked on a Spec ops/Red Dead Redemption survival arcade game.. but since my game crashed after making it almost to the end I gave up on giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it.

												We're supposed to give this a bad review because it's a failed triple A franchise, but honestly it's not really that different than any other triple A franchise out there. The fighting is fun, the mechanics are ok, but the game is never really creepy the way Resident Evil 4's opening was. It's not really a horror game, it's more of a supernatural shooter with some ok mechanics. What I think might make Alan Wake important is what it raises about triple A games and why some games become flagships like Halo or Uncharted and some end up like Alan Wake, because this is really not that different than any other blockbuster I've played recently. That said it's a horror game we're you're supposed to be afraid of what's out there, but then has a collection mechanic and more ammo drops than bad guys. They really should have just made the combat more in depth or maybe worked on disabling you a bit more and a little more oh♥♥♥♥♥♥run sequences. I never once even flinched leaving the safety of the light to find manuscrapt pages. These people need to play Amnesia more and Biohazard less.			",192,67,3,11,13,0,16

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare has improved combat mechanics compared to the prequel Alan Wake. I had the feeling the controls are much more direct and the pace of the combats is faster. I liked that. However, I disliked the story of this sequel and the level-recycling (overall there are only three medium-sized levels). This game offers also an arcade mode, which was fun for 1-2 hours. But then the arcade mode couldn't motivate me any more.  Overall I had some hours of fun with this game, therefore I give a recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While parts of American Nightmare are actually pretty fun, the overall feel of the game is completely lazy. They have made a very repetative game only coming up with about 1/4 of a game and repeating it here. This seems like a very cheap way to cash in on the success of a good game, kind of like ""Leperchaun in the hood"". Stear clear of this one unless you get it in a killer sale, or as a part of a bundle.			",299,90,8,49,67,8,40

												American Nightmare is a stand alone expansion to Alan Wake from Remedy Entertainment. Originally an Xbox live title this has made its way over to the PC with a few tweaks. Graphics are not powerhouse hungry but its not going to make you vomit in disgust at its admitadly bland pallet. As this game is set mostly in the desert with minimal indoor environmets this game is no stranger to the colour brown. The PC version does look better than its console sibling with AA options and a HD texture pack.The gameplay is very similar to the main game with a familar over the shoulder third person camera with a reasonable FOV. Ok its a very console orientated FOV and this game does play better with a gamepad than a keyboard and mouse although you want cry and bang your head on the desk if you dont have a gamepad. So I would recommend plugging in a pad and scooting your chair back a tad for a more comforatable experience. The weapons have a nice feel to them, the traditional pistol, rifle and shotgun are back with interesting additions such as the nail gun. There is enough variety of weapons around and plenty of ammo to keep gameplay fresh. The flashlight returns to burn off the ""Darkness"" which acts as a shield to enemies making them imune to bullets. But like in the main game the enemies are vunerable to all forms of lights, whether this is car headlights, flares or the sun.The game lets face it is not very long. The story mode takes about 3/4 hours to complete but considering this started out as an xbox live arcade expansion this is not a bad thing. Especially when the game costs less than a pint. New to American Nightmare is an arcade mode. This is basically a horde mode escape the zombies make it till dawn affair. It has a couple of achievements and map unlocks but single player means its not something you are going to come back to.So should you buy it? Have you played Alan Wake? If not go pick that up. Its not expensive, has a great story in the style of Stephen King novels. This game is a bit of an oddball rounding off the story that a lot of people expected from the main game. If you have played the base game, then deffinately pick this up. Although a little repeptive in the story it provides a better finish to the story you got so into in the previous incarnation.

												Дополнение к практически шедевральному оригиналу,вышедшее в 2012 году.Основные элементы геймплея сохранились,но явно чувствуется разница с оригиналом,главной проблемой которого была боевая система.В дополнении боевая система изменилась в лучшую сторону,уничтожились все недостатки боевки оригинала.Вот только это уже не хоррор,а элементарный шутер,при том,что для того,чтобы умиреть в этой игре,надо очень сильно постараться,ибо сложность врагов..практически нулевая,враги убиваются пачками,при том,можно использовать  против всех врагов пп,являющийся универсальным оружием.Вставки с актерами смотрятся просто великолепно,однако сам сюжет как мне кажется...скомканный,атмосфера присутствует,но такие детали,как в оригинале,опущены,потому через час игры хочется уже побыстрей пройти,ибо трижды бегать по одним и тем же локациям..напрягает малость.Как итог,разработчик превосходно исправили главный недостаток оригинала,с тем же успехом растеряв хоррор и всякие намеки на сложность...

												Great continuation of Alan Wake's story and if the price is right - I strongly recommend to play it!It's more focused on story depth and action and less on puzzle-solving... Also, you are properly equipped for fighting bad guys this time and ammo was NEVER an issue! :)Only con is that it took me only about 6 hours to complete including exploring the maps for the bonus content (""story-papers"")!

												Compelling plot, great graphics and sound design, loaded with atmosphere, and decent gameplay add up to make this a very good experience. After playing Alan Wake I didn't expect anything else! The game mechanics that made Alan Wake feel fresh and innovative (fighting with light etc.) make a welcome return, but new to the frachise is an interesting story that plays around with temporality in a way usually reserved for the movies. Indeed, the whole experience feels (quite deliberately, I expect) cinematic.This stand-alone expansion pack doesn't quite achieve the scope of its predecessor, Alan Wake, so I would recommend trying that game out first. Nevertheless, this stands as an enjoyable experience in its own right.			",201,53,9,18,34,5,46

												Only about 3 hours long, way easier than its predecessor, the only reason to play it is if you've already played Alan Wake and you just want to have some mindless fun, because the game has lost its survival elements. I don't even know if the story of AWAN is canon, but if it is, at least it answers some questions from AW's ending. The game is not bad, but it doesn't deserve more than a 6.5, especially when compared to its prequel.			",276,61,1,35,11,4,34

I like the  story in the game and I didn't mind the whole time loop thing, I didn't really care for the live action cut scenes...i don't really know why but I really hated the live action cut scenes.

												For fans of the Alan Wake franchise, I would totally recommend this but take in mind that while American Nightmare add some more weapons it ends up losing a touch of what made the original great.

												Although the combat seems to have improved on the predecessor, not much else really has… This may be more of an arcade style title, but the campaign is pretty much the same three small areas replayed three times; each time made slightly different… So it often feels like a very lazily slapped together game! The arcade ‘horde’ mode although fairly entertaining isn’t particularly good enough od enough to warrant return visits or to even offer a great deal of extended game-play… I guess, buying American Nightmare in the sales on Steam for a quick action experience is fair enough but I’d avoid this game at standard price, there just simply isn’t enough content to justify it! Overall I recommend!			",750,186,19,65,52,12,83

												The story in this spin-off is much weaker than in the main game and the fact you revisit the locations several times over and over again isn't too great either. But this game has got its strenghts: Finally the combat is responsive! It's even really fun. A much wider arsenal of weapons and way more enemies. I'd recommend it if you like playing survival modes. Other than that, there isn't much content here. As a nice gimmick this game tells you a few small details of what happened after the main game. Beware of playing this one before the main game, if you are interested in the story as it might spoil it for you quite heavily!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing Alan Wake I was recommended this by a friend. That friend has lost his game recommendation priveleges.~~American Nightmare is essentially 3 small maps played 3 times over, doing the same things but slightly different each time. The story is presented as to be one of the episodes of ""Night Springs"", the Twilight Zone-alike from the first game, and narrated by the same Night Springs voice. When the game started and I noticed my flashlight battery went from empty to full in about 3 seconds, and the first gun I was given was a 9mm pistol with a 10 round magazine, I knew I was in for a very different experience.The story is passable in as much as I was clamoring for more Alan Wake after the first game, and it satisfied that to a degree. Again, the radio shows are the star here like in the first game, filling in little details about the world and NPCs that you wouldn't otherwise get. This game uses an abundance of the live-action clips that were occasionally used in the first game, to decent effect. Overall the story is nowhere near as good as the first game due to the 'time loop' scenario restraining them from doing any real progress.As well, the atmosphere suffers greatly from your trusty revolver and shotgun with limited ammo becoming full auto combat shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, and carbines, with boxes that 100% fill your ammo and batteries. It becomes a straight 3rd person shooter with a flashlight gimmick which is unfortunate. That said, the game adds a few more enemy types to make up for your increased firepower, so at least some thought went into the game here.It seems that about half of the game's achievements focus around the Arcade portion of the game. I didn't play it because I'd had my fill of the Alan Wake combat, not thta it was necessariyl bad, but that I got plentyof it by the end of American Nightmare. If you enjoyed the combat the Arcade section is likely right up your alley.At the end of the day, though it's a decent game, I can't recommend it personally, because as a fan of Alan Wake, this has none of why I liked the original. However, if you liked the gunplay and combat system in Alan Wake, and you're jonesing for a bit more of the story that 'may or ma not have happened' to paraphrase the game, and you can pick it up on sale, you might as well. I got some hours of entertainment, even if it wasn't a good as the first.			",315,49,6,73,19,0,73

The Combat is entertaining and pretty easy which means you wont die half the time. The game itself is short, even if you get the achievements and collectables in the game you probably will have four hours on it total. Overall I give this game 10/10 for its great atmosphere and presentation like a Twilight Zone episode.			",56,2,0,3,1,0,6

												Although this is standalone DLC, there really wouldn't be much point playing it without playing the main game as you'd be missing a whole lot of story. American Nightmare still has a similar method of storytelling as the main game, and now features a truly psychotic villain. Now assuming you've played Alan Wake, here's what's new in American Nightmare. There are several new enemies with unique abilities. Several new weapons. A slightly modified HUD which has a more modern look to it. There is only 1 type of flashlight. Batteries fully recharge in about 2 seconds. Ammo is no longer scarce, with ammo boxes that completely resupply you with ammo and batteries. These boxes also replenish after a couple of minutes. Since you have more ammo, you will also be fighting more enemies at any given time. The overall game has a more action-arcade feel to it. There is even an arcade mode where you fight waves of enemies and then get a score with leaderboards support.Bottom Line: If you liked Alan Wake, you need to get this game. ",133,21,3,12,9,0,9

												While I'm a big fan of the original Alan Wake (a masterpiece) I cannot reccommend this game to you. A continuation of the story of our hero, you realize that this game is just capitalizing on the success of the previous game. You cannot complete the campaign unless you collect every single book page. Every last page equals playing the campaign over and over (and over)  until you get those pieces of kindling. When you have them all, you have a blah-blah ending that makes you want to throw your gaming rig out the window.When you wish this to be the sequel to a loved game, you need to keep wishing.

You visit three NPCs and do some quests to help them out, and when you're finished with the third... you just visit the same three NPCs in the same order.  I can't tell you why I'm so forgiving of Alan Wake's shortcomings, but I guess the bottom line is that I had a lot of fun.			",269,76,3,39,12,1,14

												It's fair to argue that it's okay if a game is short if it has variety and was a h---l of a time. But American(not just any) nightmare is neither. Due to the plot which is really because of time constraints and lack of effort(this did come out on Xbox Live Arcade after all)you'll be going to the same places multiple times doing pretty much the same thing. Quantum Break doesn't seem to do it and Alan Wake can't go much farther. Hopefully Remedys next IP is great4/10			",15,2,0,0,1,0,0

												Don't get this expecting a full game. It's roughly a DLC, but the intro to the story is bundled in with the main game (the two Special episodes), so it gains an Arcade mode to add a bit of substance. A word of warning: for about the first third of the game, I was worried that it was utterly, inexplicably terrible. Luckily, it's not. It is, though, mediocre, a bit tedious, and lacks the charm and depth of the original.The quickest way to explain it, in my mind, is that it feels like it was made by a different group with different priorities. Manuscript pages now unlock weapons, for no particularly well-defined reason. Ammo caches are scattered around the map, but this leads to some oddly low caps for items (5 flares, 5 flashbangs, 10 batteries). There's a bit more of an open-world feel, but the areas are small (you don't get a map, and realistically don't need one) and it leads to a lot of ugly invisible walls. There's a nice variety of new enemies, but generic enemies are basically all you fight (no 'boss battles' and just a few poltergeists). The villain is a fairly interesting character, but it feels like he doesn't really get his chance to shine (er, no pun intended - his TV bits are reasonably well done but his short appearances ingame are underwhelming).Now, most of these are tradeoffs - there's plenty that's different, but it's not objectively worse. The real problem, as far as I'm concerned, is that the story and the overall flow of the game - which are pretty directly connected - just don't work this time around, certainly not in the way that they did so well in the original.The entire game takes place in three areas, each of which has a living population of precisely one attractive woman, which considering that in theory Wake is doing all the writing is more than a bit weird (there's arguably an excuse for him, but then there's not for the developers). The central mechanic of properly 'setting up' significant story points from the manuscript is actually pretty neat, but it's hamstrung by another central mechanic which isn't explained well, runs contrary to the concept of Wake having to write a coherent story, and leads to a lot of the gameplay feeling like doing the same thing over and over again in a way that isn't particularly interesting.If you're looking for some more refined Alan Wake gameplay, this is a neat little DLC. If you're looking for a worthy continuation of the story, you might actually want to stay away. Overall, I'll give it a hesitant recommendation; there's a decent game under it all - it's just not Alan Wake.			",589,253,5,106,37,4,85

												I adore Alan Wake however was seriously unimpressed with American Nightmare when the talking started. The cut-scene dialogue between characters is unassailably bad.  Given my love for the source I persevered and started to come around thanks to the Alan Wake character and his actor's performance in narration, Mr Scratch (evil Wake doppelganger) TV clips and manuscript page readings. On the latter I hadn't really sought them out bar the ones in front of your face. As the game grew on me I decided to start again and seek out all manuscript pages because i) they're pretty interesting and ii) it spreads the game out and places the terrible character cut-scene dialogue less front and centre. This made my play-through eminently more enjoyable. Further to the exploration path, I actually enjoy the Alan Wake combat gameplay, more so with the over-the-top military arsenal American Nightmare provides.			",89,17,0,5,2,0,6

												I really liked the original Alan Wake. I thought it had some fresh new ideas, with lighting and story telling. The atmosphere was dark and creeppy, something out of a horror mystery novel come to life. That being said, this one was more of an add on than an actual game. It maintained the same mechanics, but the weapons (nail gun?), story line, and repetitive gameplay made this barely playable. I got it as a package deal from Humble bundle. Thank goodness I didn't pay for this! You shouldn't either.			",87,26,1,14,4,0,17

												I loved Alan Wake but American Nightmare just felt like a cheap cash grab, it didn't have any of the spark that the main game had and it just felt very repetitive. For the price it's fine, but I could have spent the 3 hours it took to finish playing something else, something better. And while it's set after the main game, it doesn't really follow on from the main story which was a shame. It was a £15 Xbox Live Arcade game at the time of release, so don't expect the AAA quality of the original game.			",117,14,2,6,3,0,3

												Both Allan Wake Games I thought were good and compelling. At times they had you on the edge of your seat kind of cringing to see what was going to happen next like a chainsaw buzzing your neck off in a bloody Decapitation. Or what these dark mysterious men were drawn up by Allans psych. All in all pretty entertaining stuff I liked the first one best but the second one is important if you really want to draw a conclussion from the two. This one the last will answer your questions mainly. A decent game, Ill give it a 4 stars out of five anyday easy.			",310,91,1,61,19,0,47

												it gets repetitive, but that's to be expected because you have to return to previous levels and reeneact setpieces, like an inelegant majora's mask. i think the short length helps because remedy games are at their core third person shooters with one notable hook that has to carry the whole experience, and that can grind you down ten hours in.the b-movie tone of the game is great because it masks the menacing nature of mr. scratch (who was introduced at the eleventh hour in alan wake), and it's all pastiche, which is where remedy excels at writing.

												Alan Wake's American Nightmare, I was barely a teen when I played 'Alan Wake' and it was scary as hell. This game/expandalone felt less that way (maybe that is just because I have aged a bit). Non the less the music, colors and general aesthetic make it a great game.Picked it up for a dollar during the summer sale, the campaign took me about 3 hours (was wondering around a lot looking for everything) and I think it was well worth my time.The story is very interesting, the villain (Mr. Scratch) is great and overall it is a very nice product.The arcade is a wave-based game mode where you have to survive for a set time and try to rack up as many points as you can within said time, it is a nice addition to the game.I will be coming back since there are a bunch of collectibles I missed out on and of course to play around with the arcade mode.Recommended (but only for a small price, if it is on sale or whatever)			",150,27,2,12,11,0,14

												If you liked Alan Wake you probably like this as well. The story is not as good as in the original, and also the graphics lacks a bit. It's not bad, but the original game had lovingly detailed environments and felt very real. This one looks and feels like a game. The gameplay is a bit better though. Wile in the original game, the focus is mainly on the story, here it is more action oriented. The levels are not as liner and are more open worldish. However. If you expect a similar good story and plot, then you may be dissapointed. I don't want to spoil anything, but the story (and the involved gameplay) gets very repititive.There is a nice goodi, because now there is on arcade modus, where have you stay alive for some time in a certain environment. Quite fun IMO. However, you have to play the story, otherwise you wont get access to the cool weapons.Some major difference to the original game - Wepaons are much more improved and powerfull. Savepoints are reusable and you have basically unlimited ammo because the points were you get them refill after a short time.The game is rather short. Played it through in about three hours. It's a recommendation for a sale, but not for the full price. ",426,220,13,63,30,3,41

												A little more variety than the original in some aspects, and a rather more Arcade approach even on Story mode.While this one simply cannot catch the athmosphere of the original, it does not really try to, shifting gears into a classic feeling of a Twilight Zone episode for you to play.Its rather enjoyable for what it is, a small love letter to the fans, you can tell they really wanted to make Alan Wake 2 a thing but the real world just won this round.The Arcade mode is pretty much what Resident Evil 4 did back in its years, just far more limited, it is enjoyable but offer not much else.Hopefully enough to give you new fans a closure, because that's as much as we'll get at least in the foreseeable future.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's hard to recommend this one. It should've been included with the main game, rather than being a standalone game. It's too short for one and it's repetitive as hell. There's also less humour and subtleties. It's more action oriented and ""dumbed down"" than the main game. If you're looking for a fairly simple and short action shooter, then you might get more enjoyment out of this game than I did.  Sorry, but this game  just didn't do it for me. The acting's better this time around though (except for the British scientist lady, her delivery is dreadful). The soundtrack still kicks♥♥♥♥♥as it did in the main game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the end of Alan Wake, we were promised that “Alan Wake’s journey through the night will continue.” Naturally, I believed that meant a sequel somewhere in the near future, so when Alan Wake’s American Nightmare was announced, I assumed it was that sequel. Rather than being a sequel, however, American Nightmare is more of an Alan Wake 1.5, a DLC-like expansion (think Red Dead Redemption’s Undead Nightmare or Infamous: Second Son’s First Light) that slightly continues the plot of the original, while still managing to ask more questions than give answers.That in itself doesn’t sound very impressive, except perhaps for the die-hard Alan Wake cultists. However, in some important ways, American Nightmare is better than the original.One of my biggest complaints of the original game was the dodge button, which rarely ever worked for me. In American Nightmare, it works almost flawlessly. Also, batteries recharge almost instantly. I don’t think I changed the battery more than twice in my entire play through, including all the challenges. With such a large focus placed on mobility in fights, these are extremely useful and welcome changes.The areas to explore are much smaller than in Alan Wake, but I like how they still have a very large feel to them. Once again, there are manuscript pages to find, but locating them is much easier: Instead of solely hunting for glowing sheets of paper, when you get close enough to one, it appears on the mini-map as a circled question mark. Like in the previous entry, collecting manuscript pages give deeper insight to the story, but now they also allow you to unlock cases with high powered weapons in both the story and challenges. Thanks to being more convenient to find, players don’t have to worry about feeling outmatched by the more powerful Taken.What makes this game really shine, however, are the challenges (and the new Poets of the Fall songs). You spawn in one of multiple areas, none of which are directly from the story, and are tasked with fighting back the Taken until the sun comes up (ten minutes). Defeating Taken in rapid succession increases your score multiplier, and getting hit by them resets it. The trick is balancing picking up finite ammo, weapons, flares, and flashbangs while blasting unlimited (and strengthening) waves of Taken. I had an absolute blast with this mode—the maps all feel different but fun and even more inspired than the areas in the story. There’s not much sweeter than the adrenaline rush of having a map-full of Taken and your score multiplier maxed at 9x when the sun finally comes up and blows them all away. I would not be surprised at all if people unfamiliar with Alan Wake were drawn into the franchise by this mode alone.That all being said, I’m not a huge fan of the way the main story treads over the same/similar ground for three acts. Without spoiling anything, there are three areas in the game, and you visit them each three times throughout the story, completing almost identical objectives every time. Granted, it could have been handled far, far worse—there are enough changes each time to keep things from getting redundant and stale—but this design choice borders on development limitation, not plotline necessity. Fortunately, this would probably be something avoided in a true sequel.At the end of American Nightmare we are, once again, promised that “Alan Wake’s journey through the night will continue.” While American Nightmare is a worthy appetizer for fans of the original, we are still hungry for that promise to be fulfilled once again. Because, after all, for those who believe in the power of imagination, there are things that can only happen…in Night Springs.			",26,15,0,3,3,0,1

Past that this is almost a straight up shooter, you take down guys (sheilds- their darkness) then you kill them with a few shots. Overall less anxious moments where you are scrounging for ammo or batteries for your flashlight. More straight up shooting.			",192,35,2,26,24,3,51

												An odd mix... an odd girl writing an odd review. Ok so I still don't 100% get what this was about but can say the same for the original Alan Wake too. In this, you basically replay the same scenarios a few times and I have to say by the 3rd time, I was ready to ditch the game but knew I was close so I persisted. I like the fact there's plenty of ammunition but there's not enough chances to regen some health so some enemies are quite tough and I was getting a bit frustrated at times.I'd say if you get it on sale and liked the original Alan Wake, then play it but I wouldn't pay full-price for it and don't feel there's any replay value here without getting bum-achingly bored.

You trade walking ultramarathon distances in the forests of the Pacific northwest for three maps in New Mexico.  You repeat them Groundhog Day style three times as you try rewrite what your evil twin has done.  There are more weapons in this one, but ultimately all pale to the crossbow of instant shield-piercing death you can find in the second map.  At least it's very short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Given that American Nightmare is more of an in-between-er tale than a full-on sequel, it's important not to judge it as one might a full retail title. While the story is slender in comparison to the original Alan Wake, the gameplay has been refined to a razor's edge, with the dodge mechanic working about as well as it ever has. Alan's adversary -- the sociopathic Mr. Scratch -- is a worthy villan, and the outcome leaves one wanting the full retail sequel that Remedy is currently working on. Well worth playing!

												Awesome spin-off of an awesome game. I hope Sam Lake and the guys at Remedy keep doing little stories like this one from time to time just to keep Alan Wake alive until they decide to make Alan Wake 2 (which I hope they do soon). It is less dark than the original installment but that's good, because it is another story to tell, with another mood. The idea of bringing Alan back, at least for a while, through the TV show Night Springs is awesome. If they made more like this with other stories that would be awesome.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

												Purchased at $5While much shorter than Alan Wake, I actually enjoyed this more. The story of Alan Wake took itself too serious, I felt. It really bored me and dragged on too long. American Nightmare requires no knowledge of the first game, and plays out like a twisted Twilight Zone episode. Mr Scratch was fascinating to watch on every TV I found. Great actor. The soundtrack was much more limited than Alan Wake's and thats my only real gripe. The combat and gameplay felt MUCH better here, more responsive. The arcade mode may keep you hooked for a while too. Considering this is usually half the price of Alan Wake, I think it's a better deal.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												After playing Alan Wake I was recommended this by a friend. That friend has lost his game recommendation priveleges.~~American Nightmare is essentially 3 small maps played 3 times over, doing the same things but slightly different each time. The story is presented as to be one of the episodes of ""Night Springs"", the Twilight Zone-alike from the first game, and narrated by the same Night Springs voice. When the game started and I noticed my flashlight battery went from empty to full in about 3 seconds, and the first gun I was given was a 9mm pistol with a 10 round magazine, I knew I was in for a very different experience.The story is passable in as much as I was clamoring for more Alan Wake after the first game, and it satisfied that to a degree. Again, the radio shows are the star here like in the first game, filling in little details about the world and NPCs that you wouldn't otherwise get. This game uses an abundance of the live-action clips that were occasionally used in the first game, to decent effect. Overall the story is nowhere near as good as the first game due to the 'time loop' scenario restraining them from doing any real progress.As well, the atmosphere suffers greatly from your trusty revolver and shotgun with limited ammo becoming full auto combat shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, and carbines, with boxes that 100% fill your ammo and batteries. It becomes a straight 3rd person shooter with a flashlight gimmick which is unfortunate. That said, the game adds a few more enemy types to make up for your increased firepower, so at least some thought went into the game here.It seems that about half of the game's achievements focus around the Arcade portion of the game. I didn't play it because I'd had my fill of the Alan Wake combat, not thta it was necessariyl bad, but that I got plentyof it by the end of American Nightmare. If you enjoyed the combat the Arcade section is likely right up your alley.At the end of the day, though it's a decent game, I can't recommend it personally, because as a fan of Alan Wake, this has none of why I liked the original. However, if you liked the gunplay and combat system in Alan Wake, and you're jonesing for a bit more of the story that 'may or ma not have happened' to paraphrase the game, and you can pick it up on sale, you might as well. I got some hours of entertainment, even if it wasn't a good as the first.			",315,49,6,73,19,0,73

												A brief nightmare...Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a third person shooter developed by Remedy (Max Payne and Alan Wake creators). It is a standalone game, set in the 'Alan Wake' Universe. You play as Alan Wake, a writer who has gotten stuck in a television series called 'Night Springs'.The plot doesn't have a significant impact on the original story. Continuing (if somewhat loosly) after the orignal game (specifically the DLC 'The Writer) American Nightmare tells a the story of Alan facing off against his dopple ganger Mr Strange in the fictional country town of Night Springs located in Arizona. There are manuscript pages which serves as an insight on what happened to the characters from the orignal Alan Wake, after the ending (although since the manuscripts are found inside the TV show it is debatable whether the events actually happend outside the TV world or not).Audio is quite good. Aside from some forgettable character's, the majority of the voice acting is great at instilling personality (especially Mr Scratch). Weapons sound decent like the orignal game. There are also some rock music as well which sound great during tesne fights. At non-combat moments, quiet music is played to instill a spooky atmosphere (although not as effective as the in the orignal game).Compared to the original 'Alan Wake', this game has a stronger focus on combat. Like the previous game, you need to shine your flashlight at enemies until the 'shadow dissapears from them before you can damage them with bullets. You can sprint longer than in the previous game as well as removing darkness from the taken faster as well.  There is a variety of weapons available including the familiar ones pistol, carbine, shotgun, flares, flash grenades, to new ones like crossbow, double barrelled shotgun and nailgun.  You only start off with a pistol and flashlight and you need to either find new weapons or unlock them from trunks. Weapon trunks only open when you have collected enough manuscript pages. Unlike the previous game, ammunition is plentiful and is regained through red containers attatched to walls, which also replenish themselves over time. There are also a few recognisable enemies such as the flying objects and the standard goons. New enemies include bird guys (switch between human and bird form), chainsaw guy and spiders (which all have unique attacks). Other parts of the gameplay involves moving around and collecting/activating items to move the plot. There are only 3 areas in the game rest stop, observatory and outdoor cinema area (which compared to the original game is quite small). The areas are split up and not connected like the previous game. You will also go through these areas three times (which can feel a bit cumbersome), although with some different encounters to spice things up. Another issue is that the game is quite short, taking only 4 hours for me to complete (just campaign) compared to the orginal Alana wake, which took 18 hours.There is also a survival mode available. You start with only one stage and you need to collect stars to unlock new stages. Stars are earned based on your score at the end of the stage. To increase your score you need to kill off enemies (which are basically the guys you faced in single player). Enemies come out in waves. At the start of the stage, you only have a flashlight and pistol. New weapons are scattered around the area as well as light sources (which serve as auto-healling). You also need to be awar of your score multiplier which: 1.gradually decreases 2. increases for each kill or successful dodge and 3. Reuces to zero when you get hit by an enemy.If you like more Alan Wake gameplay, namely combat, than get this game. If you wanted a game which is similar to the original Alan Wake ,ie. focuses on plot, you will be dissapointed.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Alan Wake was a great game. Alan Wake's American nightmere was a off story, aracde style game that really left me wanting more. The developers came out initially and said that it was not Alan Wake 2. Thank the gods of gaming for that. It was just okay. Buy it if you are a huge fan, if you liked the Alan Wake story, wait for Alan Wake 2.			",191,10,5,14,10,1,6

												Ah sequels. The plot in this one is pretty silly. There's a bad guy who looks exaclty like you, going around murdering people, and you have to try to stop him. It's similar to the 1st Alan Wake, but the combat does work differently, as well as having more weapons. the weapons are unlocked via a transcript collection system, which at times is frustrating. The main problem I had with this game was how repetetive it was. It recycled the same levels over and over again with only slight differences, under the guise of ""Ooooo, look, you get to have a slightly different effect on how this plays out each time!"" Which felt kind of lazy and a cheap way of extending the game. I wouldn't pay full price for the game, but it didn't feel like a total waste of time. It was kind of a nice wrap up after the first game.			",258,38,7,31,22,1,30

												My name is wez and I'm a player.  Pressing buttons and moving sticks is all that I can do to help guide a lost traveller known as one Alan Wake.  It is a story written by a character about himself trying to escape the chains of his own distorted reality and I can only interact in a way that continues this cycle forever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I won't recommend the game, especially for those who were impresed by the game, as it has nothing to do with the original spirit. It's a total happy end that screws up the whole plot. The idea of playing with yourself (if you know what I mean) is impessive, but the arcade mode... Nah.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very short but sweet. However it's nowhere near as good as the original in terms of story, writing, characters, locations, horror atmosphere, suspense and length. The storytelling is still very good expecially compared to most games out there its just brought down because the first game is so good. Gameplay is more fun then the original because of the weapon variety but i made the mistake on playing on normal difficuly rather then nightmare, normal was way too easy i did not die once in the game there was no challenge. Im not sure how much more difficut nightmare is though. Revisiting the same locations three times did not get old either it always felt different every time. The ending of Alan wake the writer DLC leads in perfectly to the sequel but this is a spinoff not a sequel to the original, as long as you keep that in mind you will have a good time.7/10 (Good)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												If you liked Alan Wake, then this one can be considered action ""sequel"" in which is emphasized ""action"", so actually the name of a game should be ""Alan Wake's American Dream"" since you get almost double amount type of weapons, like crosbow, uzi, automatic shotty etc..Enemy count is also much bigger and interesting designed but the style of gameplay is almost the same. You are Alan the writer dude who is thrown in a desert of Arizona (don't ask me how he got there, you know writers, all alcoholics, he probably doesn't remember how his♥♥♥♥♥got stranded there) and is trying to defeat his nemesis bla bla spoiler.In contrast to first ""sequel"" is that this one is relatively shorter (much shorter) and poorer story wise.. It's pretty straight forward with not many plot twists (if any..), naration is very good, you collect manuscripts again that explains the story and Alan's actions.. Antagonist is really funny and interesting guy with twisted sense of humor hehe.. I pretty much enjoyed all his videos ingame hehe, almost started to root for the guy hahaPRO- very good graphics, level and enemy design, sound is pretty good- more weapons, more enemies, more fights, more slow motion kills :) which can irritate some people though,- good playability,- new game mode (arcade) which is made only for shootin' and killin' those mofos, you need to survive til sunrise which is 10 minutes per round..CONS- since the emphasize is on fight, there is small number of puzzles (but there weren't many puzzles in the first one so..)..- weak story in contrast of first part and it's shortness and predictability.This one is fun to play as long as you don't have expectations from the first ""sequel"". Story is not on the level it should/could have been, it is obvious they were ""saving it"" for Alan Wake 2, but it is doubtful that AW 2 will ever be made though (see Quantum Break)..If you can get this game somewhere on the cheap, buy it, play it, enjoy the combat in this ""action shooter survival, NOT adventure game"", but somehow, even though I'm a fan of Alan Wake, I don't think this sequel, if you can call it sequel, is really worth 10 bucks..

												If Alan Wake was Remedy's attempt at cinematic games, this is Remedy making a pure action game. No more, no less. Using the laws of the world they established in the first Alan Wake game,  Remedy give us more to play with while biding time for the inevitable Alan Wake 2. You don't have to scratch your head trying to figure out the plot in this one, just pick up the flashlight and enjoy the action.But to be honest, this feels more like a DLC than a full-blown spin-off game.

												This game feels a lot more like a concept demonstration, intended for internal use among the developers of Alan Wake, than a commercial product. It shares most things with the original game, except the production quality. The environments are poor and reused. The story and characters are underdeveloped. The whole thing lasts a couple of hours. Very disappointing. If you don't want to taint the excellent experience of the original, don't bother with this one			",108,17,3,9,13,2,42

												so if you've played the first alan wake you'll know the story, if not you're not going to get quite a lot that goes on and why everythin's going on. this one unlike the first isn't a survival horror. it's more arcady action, it has a lot more fighting, and a lot smaller game world. if you're looking for more of the same, this isn't it, though it's a pretty decent game in it's own respect. here are some good points and some things that can be improved so you can decide for yourselfgood pointsthe unique way of fighting like the first alan wake is still in here. no spoilers, i'm just gonna say that no other game that i know of does something like this and it worksthe action. it's not surivival horror, it's a different genre (more actiony), but i still worksbecause of the action genre and the unique way of fighting, and because it's so short, it's quite replayablethe over the shoulder camera. it works out much better than a straight behind you camerathe story and dialogue are both good (the story provided you've played the first alan wake)ammo boxes. it would be a bad things if it were a survival horror to have a case that replenishes all your ammo, but this is action so it's finesome things that could be improved or implementedthe game world is small. i know it's impossibe to change now though and it's still fun, but the game world is quite small withi finished the game in about 4 hours on normal, then played though again about half way on nightmare in about 2 or 3 hours. it's quite shortyou need to find a certain amount of manuscript pages to get certain guns so it feels quite arcady and it sometimes feels like this one is more suited to a console that pc, but even if it was on console, i'd still play itthe verdictit's a good game. don't expect another survival horror at all, this is action. the story is good but if you haven't played the first alan wake yet, i'd recommend giving that a go first. american wasteland is a lot shorter and the game world is much smaller. this isn't an adventure in the way that you constantly go to new places, it's open world gameplay in set locations which aren't terribly big .not tiny, just not big by a long shot, but it gives you enough space to run around in fights. there aren't towns or npcs wandering around, just your objective locations and there might be an npc in that location. it's a good action game, and i recommend it to someone who's looking for a quick play (i finished the game in +-5 or 6 hours) ",199,20,3,17,6,1,17

												""Oh, they were all like that..."" 7/10The first thing I will say about 'American Nightmare' is that this game is extremely short and can be beaten in a few hours. Which I imagine isn't what you were hoping to hear. However, if you're a huge fan of the 'Alan Wake' series, much like myself, then 'American Nightmare' is definitely worth picking up during it's next sale. Why wait until it's next sale you might ask? Well, because this game really doesn't offer anything that the original didn't. The story-line is nothing special and the game is told through narrations that feel a little too close to old episodes of 'Twilight Zone' mixed in with what appear to be live action cut-scenes. Not that there's anything wrong with that.From what I could gather, you are fighting an evil version of yourself, or something. Like I said, the story isn't anything special. In fact, the best thing this game offers is one more chance to step into Alan Wake's world. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I mean, hey, if you like shining flashlights at spooky demons and then blasting them with shotguns and other weapons, then this game is without a doubt for you. And if you don't, then maybe you should go play something less frightening. And don't forget your flashlight.			",226,21,9,18,19,4,9

												An adrenaline-fueled expansion to the original Alan Wake! It takes the mechanics of the original, and improves on them. The controls are tighter and with the automatic weapons, makes for a more action orientated experience. Leads on from the end of the first game... What did/will happen to Mr Wake? Find out here! It feels worlds apart from the original, but hey, thats what an expansion should do right?If Alan Wake was a Stephen King novel, then this is definately a Quentin Tarantino expansion.

												Though American Nightmare can be completed within 6 hours, the game itself is a great addition to Remedy's ""Alan Wake"". Sure, it doesn't really tie into the main story but it doesn't make it less fun. The main story in this game does get repetitive at times as you will go into each area a few times throughout the story (for reasons I shall not explain due to spoilers) but the new arcade mode is very fun and the change in combat pace, new weapons, better and smoother visuals and overhauled HUD will get your interest immediately. Overall, it's a good title and I'd recommend it but a word of advice: don't expect something on par with the original Alan Wake. It's not that long and neither as deep but it's fun while it lasts.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick review:  Should you play this game? - Yes.  Will you enjoy it as much as the original Alan Wake? - Probably not, but you'll still have fun.-------------------------What I enjoyed:* Additional, powerful weapons made me feel like a one-man army.  * Excellent visual quality.* Interesting storyline that ties into the original.* Well-executed live-action components sequences.  * Mr. Scratch (!!!)My critique: I purchased both Alan Wake and the American Nightmare sequel in a bundle, so I was able to play the sequel soon after completing the original game.  Perhaps I should have given some time between the two games, because the transition between the two games was a bit jarring.  American Nightmare, despite the name, lacked much of the horror atmosphere that kept me addicted to the previous game.  It was the little things; like Alan making self-referential wise cracks about his supposedly very serious mission, the much easier enemies, and the dead-panned voice acting of the NPCs.  I did not get the impression that Alan was fighting for his life and that of his wife against an unrelenting horrific force of darkness, but rather this was just something he did that was mildly irritating.  As in: ""Eh, it's a job...  BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!!!""As for the enemies being weaker, I mean that their darkness was broken much quicker, allowing them to be killed sooner.  A large part of what made Alan Wake challenging was the time needed to weaken enemies before they could be killed.  That gamepley mechanic created many tense situations where I had to dodge an onslaught of enemies while struggling to consistently shine a light on each one, before I could even start to kill them.  This was especially tricky if I ran out of batteries in the middle of the fight, which made the eventual victory all the more rewarding.  In American Nightmare, this feature is weakened, in that I was able to break almost every enemy's darkness before they came within swinging distance of me.  Regretably, this game was also much shorter than the previous one, and I was a bit surprised when I beat it so quickly.  I literally played through the entire campaign in 5 hours.  Now, I did enjoy most of that time, but I was surprised when it ended so soon.  I am not even sure if the campaign is worth playing a second time, because I saw just about every detail available in the 3 main levels the storyline loops you through.  And regarding the games looping storyline, I did enjoy the idea of Alan continually improving his strategy on each attempt and how the NPCs started to realize something was up on the second iteration.  I was fondly reminded of the movie ""Groundhog Day"".  However, the third iteration did not add much more to the story, as both Alan and myself were thinking, ""Uh, I have to repeat this all over again...""  Right up until the game ended (too soon), I was hoping there would be more levels and another twist to the story.  Then at the ending scene, I realized that the game's developers had cleverly found a way to make a very short game three times as long...  by making you play it three times over.  Despite all of this, I DO recommend this game to anyone who has played the original Alan Wake or is just looking for a fun action game with some light horror undertones.  I had fun playing it, which is ultimately what I am looking for in any game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty cool game for the sale price. Well, worth the price of admission so to speak.The stpry was neat and the pacing was that of a fictional novel which fit rather artisticly by either design or destiny of the writers.Well, that's my take on it any ways...I played it using DS4 app and PS4 controller. It workedout well.Again, neat game and uniquely eccentric, check it out.Kevo out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*This review will contain some spoilers for the story of Alan Wake, as well as some gameplay spoilers for American Nightmare. Read at your own disgression!* Alan Wake´s American Nightmare is a spinoff-title to the original Alan Wake. While it shares a lot of similarities with its predecessor, there is a notable amount of changes and new stuff that one should be aware before considering playing it, as these changes and additions will decide whether this game works for you or not.The story takes place within an episode of the TV show ""Night Springs"" (basically the Twilight Zone of Videogames). Alan, still trapped within the Darkness of the Lake after the end of the first game (and its DLC, to be more precise), has now been trapped within one of his own stories, by none other than his doppelgänger, Mr. Scratch. Caught in a loop of endless repetition and constant torment by Scratch, Alan has to find a way to ""break the circle"" and return to the real world before his doppelgänger has completely overtaken his ""real"" life.The gameplay of American Nightmare, at first glance, is basically the same as it was in Alan Wake: You run around in comparatively small, open areas, defeat Taken, collect manuscript pages to fill in story details, and solve some (very easy) puzzles or try and reach a certain spot to advance the story, while occacionally watching TV, listening to the radio and talking to a handful of people. This all takes place on three maps: A Gas Station/Motel in the middle of the Arizonian Desert, an Observatory, and a Drive-in Theater. While each map is quite distinct from the others, you also have to revisit each map several times over the course of the game. While this is explained and justified quite well within the story, this still means that two-thirds of the campaign are repeated content (minor changes notwithstanding). Thankfully, the actual gameplay is good enough so that one can look past it.American Nightmare, gameplay-wise, improves on both Alan Wake´s enemy design and weapon selection. While the regular Taken are still the bread-and-butter of your combat enemies, there are also various new enemy types that demand some different strategies from the usual ""shine your light on them, destroy their shield, and then shoot them"". This includes Taken that are immune to your flashlight and instead split into smaller versions of themselves, Taken that flee by transforming into bird flocks, and Taken that throw ""Darkness Grenades"" into your direction, but keep their distance, among other enemy types. To counter them, Alan now also has access to a much larger arsenal, which gets unlocked the more manuscript pages you collect, so even if you don´t care about the story at all, you should still keep your eyes open for them. The new arsenal includes pistols, a SMG, an Assault Rifle, a Combat Shotgun, a crossbow which ignores the enemy shield, and a Nailgun, among others. Some stuff from Alan Wake also makes a return, like the flaregun and the flashbangs, but they have become quite a bit weaker, no longer insta-killing anything, but rather destroying their shields quickly (which is still useful, of course).The gameplay in general is alot less ""survival"" and much more action-orientated. You will pretty much never run out of ammo or flashlight batteries, individual enemies are alot less threatening than they used to but appear in bigger numbers, and there is alot less general ""creepiness"" in wandering around the desert (though that may just be me). The game, in all fairness, also doesn´t try to be a horror game, unless you count the psychological ""threat to your very existence, a doppelgänger overtaking your life"" angle. In that regard, your occasional encounters with Mr. Scratch are fun, he´s quite a cool and fun, if decidedly hammy, villain, but there´s unfortunately no fight against him, or any boss fight at all, for that matter, which feels like a wasted opportunity, given the more arcade-y gameplay.Once you´re done with the campaign, there´s also an Arcade Mode, in which you have to survive a certain amount of time on various maps while fending off enemies, raising your combo meter (by killing enemies and evading their attacks) and getting enough points to earn stars and unlock new and more difficult maps. Its quite fun (and more difficult than the main campaign ever gets), but probably not something that you will play for more than a few hours.Overall, I personally would recommend American Nightmare, especially if it´s at a discount. If you liked Alan Wake overall, but disliked its gameplay, you will probably like it. If you didn´t like Alan Wake or aren´t interested in the franchise at all, I would still say that you should check it out, but the game will probably not change your overall opinion on the series.

												Like Alan Wake but with slightly improved combat, increased weapon variety, more enemy types and a hilariously awesome villain in Mr. Scratch. Unfortunately the story mode reuses the same 3 maps 3 seperate times, each run being slightly different but not enough to make it feel fresh.It's not a lake, it's an ocean. Oooooh.

												I wish the first game was like this. streamlined & more consise Alan Wake American nightmare does everything better than it's older brother. there is more of an open world feel to this game not quite so linear, the main campaign mode is about 5 hours long.where you will spend most of your time is the arcade mode 10 levels to unlock with endless replay value, no story just great gameplay, & to unlock all 10 levels is tough very tough, you will easily spend 10 to 20 hours in this mode. Very addictive slick gameplay.Graphics the game is very well presented with a great art style & the audio is top notch for £6.99 this game is worth owning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7/10 - Not as good as original game but its ok. Characters are rather flat. The story is a bit boring at first but it gets more interesting after a while. The game itself its more like a mixture of Alan Wake and Left 4 Dead (you get ammo refils very often in here - you dont actually feel scared at all).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, Alan Wake was interresting to play but this American Nightmare is a real nightmare. No content, no story, you spend your time to do the same things three times in a row. It was so boring, i just wanted to finish it as fast as possible without looking to find each pages or listening each radio/video records.Waste of time, waste of money. Just forget this one, only play Alan Wake.			",108,12,1,6,5,0,9
