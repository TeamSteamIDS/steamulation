												Ys Origin does a great job explaining the past, it also features interesting characters that you can finish the game with (each one having their own unique game-play, equipment, short storyline and so).For those who don't know, Ys is an old school action RPG (from the late 80's) that luckily didn't got extinct in today's modern video game industry (That strives to approach to the masses), the surviving series features a very solid and hardcore experience for those who delve in to it (No hands are held here, not suitable for some casual players).Without delving that much in to the storyline, I'll start by saying that the whole game is set in a massively big tower with tons of floors where you'll actively explore till you reach the top, all because due to the fact you're part of a team that is looking for two mysterious female angel like characters who have disappeared and also they are fighting a mysterious evil that suddenly appeared on their land.Just like the first of the series, it is based on your character progression (Status), based on your skill and how well prepared and equipped you're, you'll fight tons of different minions and bosses through out the game.The game is fast paced, if you're used to a slower and less action based game, then do not delve in to this one, you'll have to be quick and prepare yourself to evade any possible attacks and at the same time plan how you'll attack your foes quickly before their defense is up again.You're forced to play the game to unlock new areas as you progress but do take in mind that you're not only forced to a narrow path, you'll have some freedom of exploration to farm and grab new items. As for the game soundtrack you'll be delighted, it is so memorable!In terms of art style and UI they are all professionally done and will set in motion your connection to the game, giving you a taste of immersion (You'll have a good read, the game has a big script), character wise; some are forgettable but overall your experience with them is quite positive. If you like Anime and you like oldschool games that are fast paced and hard, then this is the game for you!			",864,249,43,205,113,14,201

												When I bought this game, I didn't expect too much. Like may be it can kill couple of hours of boredom. Most reviews are of some grand praise but how actually this could be any good, YouTube videos quite meh, nothing amusing.     So without much anticipation I picked some girl with axe and started in nightmare difficulty. Control was good and responsive; there are some instruments in your arsenal on how to wreak havoc on your enemies. However, your enemies aren’t going to watch you kill them, some immune to this, some immune to that, some shoot barrages of projectiles, some charge without rest, some come in swarms, some bestow loads of status effects. All of them share one thing: they want you DEAD RIGHT NOW.   Terrain is quite simple, however made well in its simplicity: every zone have unique feeling about it, not like “I can watch landscape forever” of course, but certainly adds to game.    Music was to my liking, which does not necessarily mean that you would like it, but this game strong point is that tracks come in huge variety. Orchestra, piano, violin, harmonica, metal, electronic stuff – game has that all. If you played through whole game and did not like a single track that would be a huuuge “WOW!” from me.   Plot is not complex and has nothing unexpected in it but still makes you feel for characters. If you’re new to YS, it would make a nice introduction, so you won’t have “what’s happening?” feelings, if you’re veteran, some why’s and what’s would be answered.   So like I said, I picked girl with axe and started playing. Shortly I came across that guy – Velagunder, he is boss of first subsection. And he killed me… repeatedly… for six hours straight… WHAT THE F…?! I sure am not “high skilled” player or something, but I was able to finish battletoads, TNMT, contra, rollergames and such titles on NES in my childhood. What is this guy? He surely is enjoying watching me struggle, shouting angry words and writhing in agony. Six hours after he decided to surrender and I was like: “YEAH! DIE! YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! HA! HA! HA!” running around the house like an idiot. Great feeling of completion over some pixels dead body, really not what you would have often nowadays.   And what I would like to say all of this guy's friends share his hobby. This not much anticipated game gave me hell of a journey. May be not the best game I ever played, but one of most memorable for sure. I liked it so much, so I bought other YS games available on Steam, and expecting more to come. YS is great franchise forged for over 20 years already and doing great on delivering suffering and spanking to people.   In conclusion, if you’re YS veteran, I wonder why you haven't bought it already, YS Origin lives up to YS series standards in any way possible and if you’re new to YS whatever you like this game or not is up to you but it is sure worth a try.

												Ys Origin is quite possibly my favorite game on Steam.It might be because I was already a big fan of the Ys series before I played it, but still! It's a great game.Ys Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system. There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters. Each character has a very specific playstyle. To avoid spoilers, I'll only detail the initial two.Hugo Fact is a ranged caster. He is very powerful, firing off spell bullets from his wand and his twin artifacts known as the ""Eyes of Fact"" that hover at his side at all times. His is very agile, but he cannot fire while moving. Yunica Tovah is a melee attacker. Armed with her handaxe (and later greatsword), she excels at close combat. She is very quick, dealing fast, hard damage to her opponents. When you start the game, you get to choose from many different difficulty settings (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Nightmare), as well as choose which character you want to play as. Each character has their own storyline, though all three of them are intertwined. Playing each character is highly recommended, as each storyline offers more and more insight into the overall picture.Gameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings. In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens. The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore. They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere. At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss. The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat.Ys Origin includes a neat Arena Bonus Mode and a Boss Rush/Time Attack Mode. In Arena Mode, you choose a character and fight wave after wave of monster in a specific location. As you defeat enemies, you accrue SP. You can then use this SP to unlock a variety of things for this mode, such as extra costumes and even a surprise guest character! In Boss Rush Mode, you can choose to either battle one Boss at a time, or every boss in the game consecutively.The music and sound effects are top-notch. The Ys series is known for their amazing soundtracks, and Origin is no exception.  After awhile I found myself whistling along as the music played! You may be inclined to find and purchase the soundtrack online...just a warning! :POverall this is just an awesome game. I got it on sale for about $7, but in my opinion the original, full price is WELL worth it. You get a lot of game for the price.Highly Recommended ",1536,601,45,246,160,15,221

												When you think of action-RPGs you probably think of Diablo, Torchlight, and all those other games where a player’s worth is measured in the loot that they acquire. Monsters are essentially piñatas that when killed will explode into an array of multi-colored pieces of equipment. After spending so much time on games such as these, my mind dulls to the point where I stop caring about saving the world, or performing some heroic and death-defying feat. All I really want to do is look at numbers rise. I need an intervention. I need to refocus. I need Ys Origin.All you really need to know about the Ys Series is that everyone fights with an un-matched level of veracity. Imagine a thousand buzz-saws being shot out of a thousand cannons, and everything they shred also gets set on fire. When the series was still very young, the early games required the player to kill monsters by running at them and striking either of their sides. In a way the later games such as Ys Origin are an extension of this basic design. In the interest of balance, the improved controls and maneuverability means players have to contend with more intense battles. A plethora of difficulty settings assist the player in finding a level of challenge that suits them. The hardest settings deliver an experience akin to a 2D shooter, where the entire screen is flooded with death. As you’d expect from the title, Ys Origin establishes the roots of the series. Fans will quickly note all of the references to the first entry, which include characters, events, and even boss-battles. In fact, the entirety of the game takes place in Darm Tower, which is essentially where most of Ys 1 also took place. Still, aside from the boss-battles none of this is particularly exciting. This game was originally released in late 2006, and even with the update to Steam, an option to skip cut-scenes was never developed. The dialogue is fairly good, but the story is very traditional and there are certain events that have to be sat through. The time spent outside of combat, tends to be really dull.There are three playable characters in this game and each of them has a different fighting style, a few unique bosses to contend with, and their own path in the story. Yunica Tovah is the token cute-girl-with-a-big-axe. Her companions and adversaries are quick to point out her lack of magic ability, but I can’t tell the difference, when she’s summoning firebirds that lay everything to waste. Hugo Fact on the other hand is all about the spells, though his style of play can best be described by the classic arcade shooter Mercs. Expect to run & gun your way through the tower if you play as this wizard. Big brother Toal Fact is unlocked after beating the game with either of the other two characters. His fighting style resembles Wolverine. Basically you go pork or bacon on enemies and claw your way to success. Each adventure should take around six or seven hours to complete, although this can be slightly effected by the difficulty setting.Darm Tower is a lot like Dracula’s Castle in that the forces of evil can shape it to fit their whims. I’m absolutely certain that when I scoured this tower in the first game I did not have to deal with swimming through flooded corridors, jumping over spike-traps, and dealing with that always-necessary lava level. Each level has a theme and by the second or third you’ll figure out everything you need in order to progress. This adventure is almost entirely linear; however you’re free to backtrack in case you missed anything. Unfortunately even though you get some cool powers like the ability to double-jump there really aren’t any instances where you can go back to prior areas to find items you couldn’t get to earlier. This is the same case for all three playable characters, so once you learn the layout, all you have to focus on is the methods for dealing with the demons. The combat is by far the greatest aspect of the Ys series, and the same can be said for this entry. All fights move quickly and multiple types of foes all attacking at once is a regular occurrence. To keep things fair the demons have a “tell” when they’re about to attack (they blink white for half a second). Also, while all demons are capable of hitting very hard, as long as you’re exploiting weaknesses they go down just quickly. If you’re not doing enough damage, usually a level-up will balance things out, and a second or third might even make you slightly overpowered. Still, don’t expect to grind through bosses as experience points drop to about one per kill, which will force you to move on. The boss-battles in this game are especially great, probably among the best in the series. At first I was worried that every boss was going to be a weak-point mashing affair, but each encounter is varied and just awesome. Some demons like The Creeper are not only relentless but can also induce serious headaches by healing themselves in mid-battle. Unlike a few of the other Ys entries there also aren’t any herbs, potions, or elixirs that can be purchased to bail you out. But hey, all this difficulty adds to that feeling of accomplishment. Replay value in Ys Origin is certainly high. After completing the game with all three characters you’re given access to the time-attack, arena mode, and bonus shop. The time-attack is a boss-rush where you can face off against any or all of the major demons for the possibility of a spot on the leaderboards.  Arena mode has you dealing with waves upon waves of monsters, if you survive you can use the points you earn to buy prizes from the bonus shop. You can always head back to the tower and attempt the harder difficulties as well. There are plenty of achievements and getting them all practically requires that you master the game. Really there’s not a whole lot that can be said about Ys Origin. There’s no hidden meaning to be found and this is not some life-reaffirming experience that I could write thirty pages on. This is simply an excellent action-RPG that despite being more than a few years old it still contends with among the best the genre has to offer. On the other hand if your experience with the genre has never gotten beyond breaking open monsters and collecting all the armors, swords, and belts they were stowing in their nether regions, then steer clear. This game keeps it focused and judges the player entirely on their ability to evade and strike, luck isn’t a factor in the slightest.			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												A thorough evaluation of how bad you are at video games.The music starts pretty grape and actually gets better the higher you go up.Yunica has pretty cute oven mitts.If you die it's probably your fault because controls and movement are solid.The platforming actually doesn't suck (wow!).Featuring the Wolverine from the Marvel universe.Has a boss rush mode.Bosses will bully you.Higher difficulty actually adds stuff to bosses instead of just health and damage.11/10 would play again (because the game needs multiple playthroughs to unlock everything).I actually have no complaints about this game for real.

												Well here we are a few days into June 2012, and the gaming year couldn't be going better.. E3 is in full swing, with publishers announcing their latest and greatest titles. However quite frankly I'm finding myself distracted from all the excitement. Why, do you ask? It's because I have found my personal Game of The Year, and I don't think anything else that could come out right now could possibly top it. You can take your Diablos, your Modern Warfares, your Max Paynes, and you can file them all away for some other time and place. I'm too busy saving the ancient land of Ys from demonic hordes hellbent on the destruction of humanity!It has been a mere three months since XSEED made their Steam debut with the smash hit Ys: The Oath in Felghana. In that short time their crack squad of programming gurus and translation wizards have been working overtime to bring us more Ys goodness, and this time they've takes us back to the beginning with Ys Origin. This entry in the series is actually a prequel, taking place 700 years before the events of the first Ys games. This of course means that Adol Christin has to sit this round out, however do not despair! This time around we have THREE playable characters to fill out the roster, and each of them brings their own story and unique gameplay style to the table.If you have played a Ys game before (and I'm sure you have) then you should feel right at home with Yunica Tovah, our first playable character. She's a tough but compassionate young girl who has dedicated her life to protecting the goddesses. Do not underestimate her abilities because although she cannot use magic, she can swing around a massive battle axe as if it were a feather duster. Players new to the series should start with Yunica, as she is very easy to handle in combat. Once players feel comfortable they can tackle Hugo Fact, a magic user who plays out like a bullet hell shooter. The third (and secret) character will unlock once you finish the game as either Yunica or Hugo, and suffice it to say he's only for experienced players.Of course it would not be an Ys game if it didn't have big badass boss fights, and Ys Origin delivers in spades! As usual each boss has it's weak point and a pattern that you can exploit, and half the fun is figuring out how! Unlike other games that have impossibly punishing bosses, in Ys Origin if you're dying frequently you can simply level up and try again. Also be sure to check out the upgrade menu at save points, though they may seem minor, the right enhancement can save your life. Also be on the lookout for rare cleria ore, as it can be used to temper your weapons.The music and graphics are of course as stunning as you would expect from a series of such a high caliber as Ys. From the stirring violin strains of the opening theme which give way to choral chants and guitar riffs, you can guess from just that track alone that the soundtrack is something special. And it truly is, with a wildly diverse soundscape of orchestral music inlaid with the finest hair metal that Falcom Sound Team J.D.K. has to offer. Just ad rich are the gorgeously rendered 3d backgrounds and lush sprites that make up the visuals.After you finish the main quest in Ys Origin there's still plenty to do. A host of unlockables including Time Attack, Boss Rush, and Arena modes round out the package, offering hours of gameplay beyond the main story. If you yearn for an epic story with brutal bosses, complex character development, and a truly hardcore soundtrack, look no further than Ys Origin. Newcomers will find an engaging start to a new series, and Ys veterans will find plenty of references to their beloved series, and even answers to some burning questions that they may have. At a solid asking price of $20, Ys Origin is an unbeatable value. Pick it up today!			",2217,824,67,269,240,21,271

												YS Origins, a lost gem among rpg's?Ys Origins is a prequel to a series named Ys which I had never even heard of, which I was suprised considering my love of rpg's. Ys Origins feels a lot more like a very fast legend of Zelda title mixed with a dungeon crawler, as in you navaigate dungeons while solving puzzles and killing a lot of enemy demons rather than a Final Fantasy type game with it's turn based battle mechanics. The game consists of three characters Yunica, Hugo and Toal, the game must be completed once to unlock Toal.The three characters have very different distinct play styles and abilities which really makes the game feel fresh even though you are revisiting the same areas each time, also each time you will see a different side to an interesting story. The entireity of the game is spent climbing a tower, with your surroundings, traps and enemies varying from floor to floor.  You will solve puzzles while fighting hundreds of demons which will give you experience to level up to get stronger and sp to enhance other abilities. Along with the three characters the game also contains a time trial mode that times your climb of the tower and an arena mode which you fight waves of monsters increasing the replay value, which you can unlock other versions of the three characters and the main character from the other Ys games.Enemies are very varied, but every few floors you will face a gigantic boss, the boss's are very challenging needing different tactics each time and extremely rewarding when you finally finish it off. I really enjoyed playing it as all three characters and will be purchasing the other ys games on steam and reviewing those too. Pros- Nice graphics feeling retro and new at the same time- Interesting storyline and characters- Lots of replay value- Fun gameplay- Very action packed- Amazing boss fightsCons- No world map, entirely in the tower- The inside of the tower barely changes for each character- Some of the steam achievements didnt seem to unlock although im sure I met the criteriaOverall Score9/10			",190,57,4,33,6,2,12

												This is one of the best action RPGs available, with one of the best combat systems ever made. The game is also very challenging, but you can put it on an easier difficulty. Normal difficulty will cost you many deaths, especially during the difficult boss battles. The game will last you around 12 hours to play through the storyline portion, but it has high replay value. You can choose from 3 characters (1 is unlockable) and they each have their own storyline. I would say Hugo and the unlockable character have strong storylines, while Yunica has a weak one.

Posted: January 2, 2014
												So, an RPG franchise from the 80s-2000s that completely flew under the radar for me until now. Ys Origin, being my very first Ys title makes a VERY great impression on me as not only an RPG obsessed gamer, but a huge fan of the ARPG as a whole. Having only experienced Yunica's story thus far, the game itself is beautiful in nearly every way. The art style is what you would expect from the older Final Fantasy games and is greatly complemented by the stellar soundtrack. In fact, during cutscenes during major plot points, the music actually adds a powerful layer of emotion, which really made the game complete for me. The story keeps you wanting more, and you're always itching to progress some more, to see what happens next. As for the gameplay, it is nothing but awesome. Even though Origin takes place in one location only, each new floor you ascend to varies from the previous floors, so you never end up feeling bored, or feeling like you're on a slow grind to the summit. Enemies are varied, environments are varied, and nothing really seems to be reused. It's hack n' slash style gameplay is also fast, and furious, and there's little to no downtime between enemy encounters, which keeps the flow of the game fresh and constant, which is a must in an ARPG. Boss fights are unlike anything you'll see in today's generation. Boss fights have multiple mechanics to each, and force you to learn the mechanics until you're doing that fight like clockwork. Some boss fights become intense endurance matches, and when you see the boss fall to your feet, the feeling of victory is nothing short of amazing. Overall, if you love RPGs, or you're just looking for an intense hack n' slash game that will keep you busy for quite a while (Between playing through all three storylines, time attack, boss rush, and Arena), give Ys Origin a try. You seriously won't regret one moment of it.			",171,9,0,22,7,1,3

												This is certainly an interesting game, it starts a little slow and just throws you in but thats pretty standard for a JRPG or a Hack n slash game. Now the combat has three styles depending on the charecter that you are using, the first uses an axe and physical skills, three skills and each of those skills have charge ups depending on how much power you which to throw at the bad guys. The second charecter is a little slower but they can use magic, its pretty much the same but different ranges/speed/damage etc. The third charecter is a secret you will have to find that yourself because its a spoiler if I tell you. Expect the gameplay to be vastly different for each of these charecters, you can also get various varients of the charecters which changes the way it all plays out.The artstyle is pretty old fashioned, its immersive though so it doesnt really matter. In the various dungeons that you are in you will find various artstyles depending on what theme that area is going for. Its pretty cool and the soundtrack that goes with it helps a lot.Onto music which we touched on before, at the start you would think that its a little cookie cutter but after a while you understand that the music goes with the various themes and the emotions of the game. For this reason they seem to compliment eachother very well and it sort of amplifies the emotions that you feel throughout the game. Storyline of this game isnt the most complex one ever id say, that being said ive only done a singe playthrough and its designed for you to play the three charecters because they each have different viewpoints in the story, they each lead to the same point but you will have to face various challenges to get to your end goal. At some points you will question what your protagonist is thinking or what their motivations are. Its well thoughtout id say but the introduction into the game was a little poor. As i understand this is the first in the series so i imagine it is meant to lay down a good foundation to the rest of the series so think of it as a prologue, a very long prologue. Its about 10-12 hours to finish the story for a single person, i imagine its the same or faster with the others.Difficulty, this is the meat of the game because holy hell is it hard. Just go into the discussions and you will witness the poor souls that have come close to throwing all sorts of hardware out the window, at the wall or at a sibling due to how hard this can get especially the bosses. The normal difficulty of this game is hard, the easy difficulty of this game is challenging, hell even in very easy you will struggle at times. Its not for the faint of heart but that is a good thing because its pretty rare to get a fleshed out game with those sorts of scenarios anymore. It also leads to the 400+ types of monsters that you will occur, some are strong, some are weak, some resist fire, some arent. You will encounter all sorts of rabble but they all want to kill you. In the end this is a game that i can recommend to anyone, if you dont want to break anything then play on very easy and then work your way up, it certainly is addictive and you get one hell of a euphoria after you beat what seemed like an unbeatable boss at first(looking at you mantid)			",287,101,36,76,28,0,27

												This game has lots of possibilities as far as completing the game. You really have to explore everything in order to obtain all of the items. While I did complete the game without finding all the the items, there is something if your at a certain level you need to obtain to drastically reduce the amount of damage you get in the final boss scene before taking them on.

												Another JRPG game. Yes, another great game. As a fan of rpg games. I can say that Ys origin have alot of rich stories from different perspective of the characters. This is an rpg with action that requires more than repeatedly hitting the same buttons. If you have played a YS game before then you probably know what I'm talking about.The buttons are simple, it's easy as 1 2 3. There are 5 modes that you can play. Which are the Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard & Nightmare. A single playthrough on Nightmare takes about 30 hours the first time through, it's pretty hard. So those repeatedly buttons will require more than skills to finish it. There are 3 different characters that you can play, different skills, different stories, and different outfits. lol. From the artworks and cutscenes, it takes creativity in order to create something like this. I can't say I like it, I love it. There's alot of things you can do here, you won't get bored I assure you.After completing the game, you get to experience new menu's from the game which includes the arena mode, boss rush and such. If you're really planning to 100% complete this game, goodluck. What I didn't liked about the game is that, the dialogues are pretty much the same for the characters but your experience will be pretty much the same each time aside from different attack methods and skills of the characters. You'll understand this if you play the game.So all in all, if you don't have this game. You're missing out 1 great rpg game. 8/10.			",331,122,9,39,30,3,37

												I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:http://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/07/ys-origin.htmlWhat sets this game apart?The Ys series has been a popular action RPG franchise since 1987, but has only had limited release in the US.  Ys Origin serves as a prequel to the rest of the series chronologically, but is one of the most recent releases in the series.    While the combat sometimes seems more like a hack-and-slash action game than an RPG, there is a sense of strategy and patience required in some areas, especially boss fights, which maintains a more cerebral element in the game.  In addition, there are some good platforming sequences and simple puzzle elements that add enough variety to keep the game from feeling monotonous by breaking up the combat sequences.What is the difficulty factor?This game is extremely simple to pick up and play.  It features the choice of mouse and keyboard controls featuring point and click movement, or you can control your character with just the keyboard when more precision is needed.  Personally, I only use the mouse when I have a slice of pizza in my left hand.  When new powers are unlocked, brief tutorial screens pop-up to explain their use, and most of them feel fairly intuitive anyway.  The game also does a fairly good job of offering direction, feeling fairly linear except for a few brief moments, often due to dialogue from the NPCs.With that being said, this game is not without its challenging points.  The bosses tend to be extremely powerful, at least until you master the patterns of their attacks.  Even then, they require some precision movement and possibly some level grinding to survive.  For those familiar with the bullet-hell genre, you may find yourselves following a familiar strategy of focusing on not getting hit, only taking attacks when you have the rare opportunity.  The rest of the game is fairly tame, although if you let yourself get impatient or careless you will likely end up dying.  Save often.Does it use media effectively?I feel a bit torn regarding the visuals of this game.  The cut scenes use a great mix of 3-D and anime style graphics and are usually gorgeous to look at.  The hand drawn character art used during dialogue is on par with many other games, although the character designs feel a bit stale, like you’ve seen them all used before.  The sprites for the characters have an odd, compressed feel to them, looking more like dwarves than the anime style drawings used outside of gameplay.  The game also uses an odd semi-locked camera at three-quarter view, but the level designs do a good job accounting for this.The music in this game is phenomenal, playing on both the classical and rock aspects of traditional game music to keep every fight intense.  One thing that struck me was the lack of voice acting in the game, which I feel could have done a lot to enhance the overall experience of the game, especially during some of the longer cut scenes that can break the momentum of the game.Best moment in the game?Without a doubt, the star of Ys Origin is the boss fight experience.  Every boss fight seems bigger and more epic than the last, and each one requires better timing and more complex movement to follow its pattern.  Off hand, I really enjoyed the giant centipede boss, Nygtilger, playing as Yunica.  It wasn’t necessarily the hardest boss, but the amount of movement and explosions, coupled with the amount of time you spend climbing on it made it a really fun experience.Who needs to play this game?While it doesn’t have as many exploration or story elements as many other games of this genre, Ys Origin’s saving grace are its gameplay and music.  Each character has a very different feeling to its playthrough, including some alteration of the level design and especially the bosses, greatly increasing the playtime on this game.  With scalable difficulty and already difficult bosses, it can also prove a suitable challenge for players seeking it, or to encourage subsequent playthroughs.  Personally, while I enjoyed the game, I am glad I picked it up while it was on sale.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I would wait for the next Steam sale to roll around to pick it up.

												Fast paced, mash em up anime type game.Nice little story, with a pretty good soundtrack, considering you're going to be hearing the same tracks a lot.Some games have frustrating OST's like Banjo Tooie. Where the only reason to finish the level is to change the music. (Lookin at you Glitter Gulch Mine)But yeah the ost is great.When I bought this, I wanted sort of a steam version of Tales Of Symphonia, which is sort of what it turned out to be. Really just because of the anime stuff plus the mash buttons strat ya gotta employ.It's got a lot of replayability with it and it's tantalizing to see the end of the story.So basically,1. Keeps you interested (Storywise)2. Decent soundtrack3. Doesn't p!ss you off			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ys Origins is one of these great games you've never heard about and that has been lying on steam unknown, its worth unrecognized. Hier of a presitigious part gaming series that exists since the 80ies, Ys origins is a solid title If you don't mind anime art style and story tropes you'll have a solid isometric action RPG, with excellent bossfights and a demanding, nervous very satisfaying gameplay typical of japanesse games that has been embodied recently by darksouls./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Ys Origins est ce genre de jeu qui traine sur steam, un peu perdu et oublié. Héritier d'une grande saga ayant commencé au cours des années 80, Ys origin est un titre généreux a condition de ne pas avoir d'alergie style manga que ce soit d'un point de vue esthétique ou narratif, par-ce que les clichés, vous allez en bouffer, chose qui n'empêche pas le jeu de conserver un certain charme et d'être une petite tuerie au niveau de son gameplay : boss-fights intressants et exigeants, très bon rythme de progression. Voilà du jeu japonais bien fichu et nerveux qui n'est pas sans rapeller Darksouls, même si la comparaison entre les deux s'arrête là.			",318,56,0,50,27,1,66

												Ok, to put in perspective how good this game is, I was recommended this game by a friend and within the weekend I ended up beating it with all three characters.  Within a month I had played every Ys game on Steam.  After a while I ended up playing every localized Ys game and eventually I even played the fan translated Ys V.  This series is that good.  This game is like a gateway drug, only instead of being a gateway drug to something worse, it's like upgrading from sex to wild orgies with beautiful women.  This game controls like a dream, looks gorgeous on high settings, and is just challenging enough to feel like a real accomplishment when you progress.  If you love action RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play it.  Just remember, you're getting yourself into a beautiful addiction that you won't be able to stop.			",126,5,1,8,7,0,4

												A truly epic action RPG experience.  Controls are intuitive and easy to learn, and the game uses these to present a brilliant and thoroughly challenging experience, with some of the best boss designs I've seen, sometimes highly difficult yet still fair.  Three different playable characters provide three different storylines with their own bosses and events.  The soundtrack ranks among the best game soundtracks of all time, creating an atmospheric richness that compliments the excellent visual presentation.  Together, they create a dramatic narrative punctuated with highly memorable encounters that leave you very satisfied when you emerge victorious.(Disclosure: I received this game as a gift from a friend, who bought it while it was discounted.)

												Even with its focus on Dungeon Action/Platforming, YsO is by far my favorite adventure game and story amongst Falcom's lineup currently on steam.  The dialogue and localization is fantastically written, realistic, and invests you into characters without spoon-feeding you or succumbing to many of the usual JRPG tropes.  The game is challenging at appropriate difficulties, and like all of Falcom's games, changes the way bosses fight instead of just increasing their damage like a lot of other games boringly do.  The music is also a given if you know anything about Falcom and the in-house JDK band.Potential drawbacks do include having to go through multiple playthroughs in order to get the complete story out of the game, but each character's strengths/weaknesses are different enough to provide a much different gameplay experience in addition to the altered story perspective.  The game is also fairly short to where you could probably finish the game within 10 hours on the lower difficulties without issue if you rush, but the quality makes up for it.By far the most satisfying game I 100%'d on steam.

												It took me running back and forth between 12 floors before I realized that one of my items allows me to fast travel... In all seriousesness though this is one of the funnest games I've played. It's easy to learn, hard to master, and offers a decent challenge. Plus with 3 different characters, each with their own unique play style, this game has a very high replayability level. My only warning is that if you don't take the time to explore you'll miss key items like weapon upgrades that will make the game nearly impossible later on.			",35,3,0,8,3,0,2

												+ The music is really good, particularly the boss music. You will be hearing a lot of that.+ It's like a mostly-2D cutesy Dark Souls.+ Controls are mostly very tight, the only weird thing I noticed was sometimes accidentally firing a second skill after using a charged skill. If you get hit, it's probably your fault.+ Bosses are all sufficiently unique that it feels good to die to them over and over again until you learn their patterns and beat them into the ground.- Level scaling and equipment levels' effects are ridiculous. It seems like either the designers or programmers didn't know how much damage a boss should do or take. After spending ten minutes grinding a few levels or finding weapon or armour upgrades, a boss can go from doing 20 damage a hit and taking 50 a hit to doing 8 damage and taking 100. It doesn't take that long to grind, but it's make-work and is frustrating when you just want to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the boss on a balanced playing field. It also feels pretty lame when you enter a new area and are suddenly doing 1 damage a hit to enemies that look almost identical to the ones you have been pulping before.- No auto/turbofire function for Hugo, the projectile-spamming character. I gave up on him after an hour when I decided damaging my hands was not worth it. - Puzzles are mostly formulaic and consist of find x item and bring it to y location. Potentially cool stuff like the Mask of Eyes which lets you see and interact with hidden objects while blinding you to living creatures is used only a few times in the entire game.- Plot is completely ignorable. Villains like power, heroes like the power of friendship. News at ten.			",388,98,10,60,40,2,69

												Just like all games in the Ys series, what you're getting with this title is a fast-paced action RPG. The regular enemies are mostly an easy grind, but the boss battles are a different story. If there is another thing the Ys series has a reputation for, it's grueling boss battles that often require multiple attempts and still manage to decimate your HP even if you emerge the victor.The one major downside to Ys Origin is that----unlike previous Ys games that involved exploring an overworld, traveling to different towns, and exploring different dungeons---Ys Origin is just one non-stop slash-fest through a single extremely long dungeon. While the dungeon wallpaper does change somewhat as you make progress, the entire dungeon pretty much feels exactly the same, which can leave you feeling bored of the scenery hours before reaching the final boss.The game also has multiple characters with which to complete the campaign as well as an unlockable arena mode. If you are the kind of person who likes that kind of extra content and you like the action of the game enough that you feel like making one more go through the dungeon all over again with a second character, then you will be pleased to have the option. As for me, I personally got too bored of being trapped inside the one neverending dungeon for 14 hours, so the idea of doing it all over again just to play with a different skill set for fourteen MORE hours does not sufficiently entice me. Since the game is somewhat of a grindfest (especially near the end), I just don't find the replay value to be nearly that high. Still, it is a great bonus for those who want an extra challenge or just haven't eaten their fill of the hacking and slashing yet.I feel like I only have one major gripe with the game, which is that the designer chose to arbitrarily disable your ability to pause the game or access the main menu during boss fights or cut scenes (which--to make matters worse--are unskippable). When I raised this concern to other players, some came to its defense explaining that it is an intentional design decision to keep you from swapping equipment in battles. However, I don't think that is a very good excuse. One very well could have disabled access to the inventory/equipment screen only. But making it impossible to pause the game or open the main menu means that, for example, if you decide that you want to QUIT the game during a boss battle, then your only option is to Alt+F4 or kill it via task manager. Both of those are easy enough to do, sure, and yet I can't help but feel like this is an obtuse and unwieldy measure taken for a small design nitpick. The fact that you can't skip cut scenes or even open the main menu during cut scenes seems even less excusable, since there can be no game design argument for it.Small gripes aside, if you are at all a JRPG fan/enthusiast and want to slash up some monsters in an action RPG, I'd recommend giving it a whirl.As for the other question: is it worth twenty whole dollars? I personally feel like $20 is slightly steep for this one. $15 feels like a good maximum price to me. $10 or below is a bargain. Therefore, using the rating scale below, I rate the game at around a 4.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.

												Most people, if you ask them to name a 25-year-old game series in which you explore dungeons and fight monsters, will likely say “The Legend of Zelda”. Even though the Ys series is as old as Zelda and has enjoyed immense popularity in Japan since the first game, Ys 1: Ancient Ys Vanished (1987), the series has never been that popular outside the Orient.A few entries did make it west on PS2 and PSP, either through Konami in 2005 with Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim (the first English release of the series in thirteen years) or XSEED’s masterful handling of translations starting with Ys: The Oath in Felghana. XSEED released Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (1989), on Steam in March. This is the first time most PC gamers get to experience what is (in terms of number of game releases) the largest Eastern RPG series second only to Final Fantasy. Released on Steam in May, Ys Origin is the seventh game in the Ys series and a prequel. It takes place first in terms of chronology, 700 years before the events of “Ancient Ys Vanished” (Ys I & II). As you explore a huge vertical dungeon known as “Darm Tower”, the game elaborates on much of the series’ backstory, including characters, mystical artifacts and locations. There are three playable characters (one is initially locked until you beat the game once with either of the other two), each has their own story and combat style. Yunica, a young knight, uses an axe and sword for close-range melee. Hugo Fact, genius magician and all-round ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, shoots bullets and is the easier of the two to play. We’re not going to spoil the third character for you.Combat is fast and action-packed, with enemies having clear and recognizable patterns to their attacks. As you hack-and-slash your way up the tower, there are some mild puzzles to solve and mild platforming elements to jump through. There’s a kind of momentum system to keep you pushing forward: as you kill enemies without stopping, you gain a bonus to the rate at which you get experience points and “SP”. The “SP” points are spent to permanently buff your character, such as increasing resistance to negative effects like poison or confuse , or to upgrade your armour.The boss fights are where the game (and series) really strut its stuff. While mowing through general enemies is pretty easy, boss fights require focus. You’ll need to learn their attack patterns, figure out which skills to use against them, and if you’re really into that kind of thing there are Time Attack and Boss Rush challenge modes.

												Ys Origin is an original JRPG/Hack & Slash game with really good fighting mechanics, a decend story and Metroidvania style levels.If that's not enough praise, let me say it's one of the best games I've ever played.You first (first because you can unlock more characters) play as Yunica Tovah, a young woman who has sworn to protect the godesses of her world; a girl who is looked down upon by all the other guards because she possesses no magical powers whatsoever. A girl, that proves to be more than valuable and capable without magical powers in rescuing the godesses and the whole world in the course of the story.The gameplay feels really slick, it's not simply a matter of button mashing but you have to react to what enemies do and figure out strategies to effectively kill each one of them. They have certain movesets that are predictable and thus can be learned - something I really appreciate. There is no buIlsh!t going on with the enemies. If you fail, it's your fault - it's quite Dark Souls'esque in this regard. Especially noteworthy are the bosses that are all very unique in their mechanics and that are thoroughly fun to fight. Each and every one of them has move-sets that are to be learned and understood if you want to defeat them. It's not too difficult to figure out what to do because each of their movements can be predicted by the animations they have - to me it seems that's one of the biggest strengths that Japanese/Asian games have over western games (the rules to beat the game are very clear - it's still tough).The level design is great. There may be some backtracking involved but it's really only if you didn't check everything properly in your first run-through. Everything is connected in a consistent and logical manner and there are various styles of areas.The sound design is great as well. The feedback you get for your actions is quickly ingrained into your brain, and helps you understand what's happening even if you can't take in all the visual information at the time - perfect. The soundtrack is pumping and very well done, suits the overall game.The graphics are not top notch but they suit the kind of game Ys Origins is. They are probably even perfect for what the game tries to achieve. They are simplistic but nice to look at, everything fits together and there is nothing that sticks out as ugly or unfitting. Especially noteworthy are the character models that look very nice.My one problem with the game is that if you are underleveled, you will have a really tough time against some of the bosses. An unnecessarily tough time that may force you to go back and grind 2-3 levels. Which doesn't take too much time but is tedious nonetheless and could've been circumvented by making levels count less and making items count more for the overall strength of your character.All in all - who woulda thunk it after reading what I just wrote - Ys is one of my favorite games of all times.I won't give you a stupid random number for this game though - judgements of games are always subjective.If anything, I'd give the same rating Conan O'Brien gave for Tomb Raider:Edit: Sorry, but it doesn't start you at the right time, even though I linked with time. Jump to 7 min, 30s for the rating :)

												If you are a fan of aRPG's, this is a must have. To be honest, to me it doesn't look like much with the RPGMaker style graphics, but don't be fooled. As a fan of hack and slash, and already owning many great jRPG's I would have completely overlooked this one if not for the great price on a STEAM sale and such positive feedback. The story and characters are quite adorable. The tower is well laid out, simple small maps for each level/story, yes it feels like a dungeon crawler,but technically its a tower. In which you start your adventure at the base of the tower searching for 2 princesses. Music is really well done, animations etc, just exceptional, a really cute fun game. Technically as an aRPG fan this game is well worth full price, but if you are like me and have a large back log of great games, it comes on sale for a few dollars now and then. For a few dollars this one is a no brainer, as a casual and value gamer this one is a steal of a deal. Do not miss this one! Probably the cutest aRPG I own. Yes i say aRPG, it really doesn't feel like a jRPG to me honestly. Mostly because when the game starts, the story telling is in French(I am pretty sure) and English dubbed. Some may not like the unskippable cutscenes, especially if you have already had one playthrough, I personally am not really a fan of visual novels either but once the gameplay actually starts up, its not that bad or as long of cut scenes, but I do agree there should be some sort of skip/next button.

Pros:-+Best Ys game.+Best Protagonist +Best Story Line+The game that starts it all+Best Soundtracks and the theme.+Balanced gameplay. +No Ridiculous grinding required (Unless you are playing on hard or nightmare).+No annoying difficulty scaling like in the other Ys games.Cons:--You can't skip dialogues which gets tedious at some point because if you like me want to get every achievement. It IS required for you to beat the game on multiple times and one even requires to beat the game on nightmare with every character. For me beating the game wasn't that hard, but the need to go through all those dialogues and cut-scenes again and again. It just takes so much of your time to even complete one playthrough!

												I was given the idea to play Ys Origin by a streamer I watched and a friend I often speak to who had nothing but praises for this franchise. When I first picked up this game I had my doubts and I wasn't entirely sure if I was going to enjoy playing it or not. I was dead wrong. Ys Origin is quite the amazing game, I have finished the game on two different difficulties with two of the characters and doing a nightmare playthrough on the 3rd. Even on Nightmare this game is still fresh and challenging, i've spent my time streaming this game a lot longer than I usually stream, upwards to 8 hours from my usual 5 hours and I don't want to put it down. The story itself can be a bit difficult to follow if you haven't played any of the other games but it's a enjoyable experience itself. The combat in the game is superb and the bosses equally so, there are some minor annoyances but the game outshines them completely. I would recommend getting this game if you're a fan of great combat and RPGs. 10/10.			",104,5,1,18,6,0,9

 For god sakes those who say this game is not recommeded I don't know if you are a freaking person. Glad this is overwhelmingly positive reviews the game deserves it.Hope all Y's Games will be on steam and sale or not definitely worth the penny.The excuses for negative reviewsNo pauses in boss battles (just like online games) so don't bother on your keyboard to press it all because it is disabled in this gameSuper overwhelming challenging bosses (another reason for negative reviews just because it is not an easy RPG that you always love doesn't mean its already negative? ergh !? The infamous unskippable cutscenes ! (the most stupid reason for negative reviews) One guy there give this a negative just because its unskippable and did not play the game. Wtf!? Insane humanity is nowaday. BAW GAWD ! help us.Now to move on why this game is highly recommeded Great music nostalga soundtrack - Yup the feels sometimes I stop grinding and going to my inventory to listen some piece of great music.Grinding/Lvl up/Mobs- The least best on this game for me but still an awesome dungeon crawler game.3 Playable characters- Not like other ys games this is the most polish and well made ys gamer ever (for me) ! Godlike badass bosses-The boss from start to finish is insanely hard even in very easy difficulty. You must study the bosses power and trick to beat them takes time and patient to beat all bosses. Special mention the boss fight music is insanely badass. Downloaded ys origin OST ! download it too if you want . :)Story/Art/Graphics- Well written amazing art nostalga graphics. Not just that the story slighty change when you play a different a character. Overall Gameplay Experience- Amazing one of the best JRPGs that I've ever played the best Ys game ever. I love dungeon crawling I love the dungeon challenges and mostly I love the search party crew. If you don't like challenges,trial and error and nostalgic feeling then stay out of this game.11/10 One of the best games I've played.Price is just about right but recommeded buying it on sale or not :) Still hoping all ys game will be on steam. :3Sorry for my english and grammar I'm an asian please spare me :D			",54,8,0,6,1,0,3

												Ys Origin is an isometric rpg game that plays like a game you would see in the arcades very action oriented and fluid. in Ys you play as one of three selectable characters and go through their journey in order to help the goddesses fight off evil that dwells within the tower. Each character has their own dialogue and conflicts most notably the secret third character has a lot more bosses than the other two. 	Progression+Statues offer instant traveling back and forth+Enemies are highlighted red to progress+Grinding is minimum (10-15 minutes if you're underleveled)Traveling from floor to floor can take some time, luckily you have goddess statues that teleport you instantly to other statues you have unlocked along your travels in the giant tower. This allows the player to be able to teleport to any floor he thinks requires more exploring weather its to grab a item he missed or simply to teleport back to floor 1 for upgrades. Not only that but you are fully healed when in range of the goddess statue, you can also save.There is practically no grinding in this game if you do not skip mobs, even if you were somehow still underleveled its relatively quick to level to the proper tier for the boss. Grinding is not required in order to defeat bosses, it can be beneficial in order to survive more hits but dealing more damage only works on anything under the highest difficulty. Being on nightmare there is set amount of damage you are going to be able to do against any bosses. This is to keep the game challenging for the purpose of the difficulty mode so that players won’t find a easy way to accomplish the feat.Red highlighted enemies are triggers to progress through the levels. For example killing a red highlighted knight can trigger a jumping platform so you can reach a certain area otherwise unavailable. Level Design+Nice variety of environmentsDespite the entire game taking place in a giant tower there is a surprising variety of environments and design with their own elements that seperate how you proceed through them. There is platforming but it never really gets too complicated to the point where you're constantly backtracking because you cannot perform the required jumps, its especially gets easier once you get helpful power ups like double jump.Mechanics+Multiple obstacles throughout the game solved with unique items-Cinematics can interrupt your movement (Very Rare)Going through the game you will find yourself often unable to past an obstacle that requires you to have a special item in order to proceed to the next floor. For example the item that helps with magic resistance will be useful for resisting the pull of statues trying to drag you down into a trap that sets you back to another floor and further away from your goal. Cinematics interrupt your movement if you happen to be above a trap for example in water when you trigger a cinematic you will fall into the spike trap and take damage when you're able to move againGame Modes+Nice leaderboards (keeps track of alot of variables/characters)Upon beating the game you will unlock more content for example the first time I beat it with Mittens, I unlocked time attack which features a circuit of going through all the bosses you fought throughout the game with set equipment and having to race the leaderboards in order to pass your friends. ConclusionYS origin feels like one of those old very challenging arcade games with rpg elements and some platforming. The features a nice variety of boss types, even more bosses can be discovered by playing the other characters which gives the game more replayability. The game lasts around 12 hours per playthrough and with 3 characters thats a good chunk of time not to mention you have extras to go through.			",608,187,12,74,51,9,81

												I'd say this is the best Ys 6 engine game we have on Steam, as far as gameplay mechanic goes. It has (I think) the most bosses, it also has the best bosses, its dungeon is really well-designed for the most part, and the action got even further refinement from Oath in Felghana. There are two problems however. Having three character is nice, but having to play three times is not nice, especially when considering the dungeon design stay more or less the same. And when that third and hidden character's story is the ""truth,"" it means you have to play it at least twice to get the actual story.So it actually comes down to how much into Ys you are. I do not recommend this to people who are going into Ys for the first time; it's not a good reflection of how Ys series actually work, because it's a game entirely based on dungeon-crawling. Not only that, the storytelling is more similar to Trails series than Ys series (same scenario writer), so you have to be fine with crap-ton of dialogues.If you like Ys 6 and Felghana, you can just play it once as Yunica to feel satisfied with its mechanics, because it's one hell of a tight ARPG, but really, the game wants you to have played Ys 1 and Ys 2 before playing this. The level design, story, characters, background music, they are all designed around the fact this is a prequel to Ys 1 and Ys 2, and the game doesn't shy away from making that connection.But to be honest, if you've played Ys 1 and Ys 2 and have fond memories of it, Ys Origin has such a good story that gets to you in so many ways. There are so many subtle connections to Ys 1 and Ys 2, and a lot of them add a lot of emotions to those games retrospectively. You get to understand its lore better, a few of its characters better, and you get to understand why and how things came to be when Adol first got washed ashore on Esterian beach in Ys 1. It's dependant on whether you have played those games or not, so it's not recommended to everyone, but if you have, this is a must.			",172,32,6,27,16,2,52

												I followed this game from the psp releases.If you want an action/rpg game cause you miss the old days, this is one of the highly recommended.Possitives:Nice game play and terrain, as they used to be on Ys series.The character skill progress develops pretty cool as you find gems that match the skill's origin gem.Different flavored characters, which are making the game experience totally different from one to another.Negatives:Graphics could be a little better, but it's not really a thing.If you are looking for a game which is HARD to finish, along with much grinding to find 100% of secrets, this is the one for you. Especially for the hardness part, on highest difficulty you will really get annoyed from pressing the f'ing ""Retry"".Have fun all.			",166,29,4,32,10,2,18

												Ys is a great series in general and you won't be disappointed with this game. It's the 8th game from the series. It's only available on Pc and it's a prequel of Ys I & II. (So it's better to play Ys I & II to understand a bit more.)So first of all, I just want to add that I have around 120 hours on this game and I didn't finish entirely. (I'm finishing the third character at Nightmare Mode and I'm focusing to get every achievements. Not an easy thing to do.) Pros:-The story is great. (You will get the point of view on each character.)-4 difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard and Nightmare)-Music is so great.-Fast paced game. -Button mashing game.-Anime game-Time attack/Survival modeCons:-Nightmare mode can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You really need to focus on farming a lot of level and to know every pattern of each bosses. You will restart a lot of them and yes, you will want to throw you controller at your screen a lot of times.-Only two characters (a third one can be unlocked. But if you only play only one time with Yunica or Hugo, you won't be able to unlocked it.)-The ""real"" story is with the third character. So people who don't love to play the same game over and over won't be able to taste it. (You need to complete the game with Yunica and Hugo, that's it.)-Maybe overpriced if you only play one time and at easy mode. (Approximately 4-5 hours if you know what to do.)Note 9/10 because this game has made me a fan of Ys.Edit : If you want more information about the order that you need to play the game, check this link :

												Ys Origin is a great example of an Ys title: lots of fun hack-and-slash combat with awesome environments, great boss fights and a killer soundtrack to boot. It's also unique compared to other games in the series due to the fact that you never play as Adol, but rather as two (actually three) other characters, each with their own style of combat. There's Yunica, whose style is the most similar to Adol's, with mid-range combat skills. Then there's Hugo, who's more of a long-distance fighter. And finally, the third character, whose storyline is considered the ""canon"" one but is also the hardest due to his short-range fighting style. Although there are differences between the three, you're still exploring the same dungeon, so it may get repetitive playing as each one. However, doing so helps flesh out the world of Ys further and brings some fun tie-ins to Ys I and II.The difficulty of the game is well balanced. Normal feels just tough enough but not too much so, making it an enjoyable and rewarding experience. There's also plenty to do for completionists, from beating the game on the highest difficulty (Nightmare) to doing Boss Rushes to Arenas. It'll keep you coming back until you've unlocked all the things and gotten all the Steam achievements. Again, it's hard but not so hard that it seems impossible. Overall, I'd recommend this game to people looking for a fun adventure title and are maybe looking to get into the Ys series as a whole. I'd also suggest looking into Ys: The Oath in Felghana, which is equally fun but with more exploration and a shorter game time (which some may prefer).			",14,10,0,1,1,0,2

												Just about everything important is well made in this game. The gameplay is satisfying with its RPG elements, action based combat and simple platforming, the soundtrack is absolutely great and fitting for the gameplay, the main characters are surprisingly interesting and the bosses offer plenty of challenge, really requiring you to learn their patterns and time your attacks correctly especially on higher difficulties. Even the story has its moments despite never being invasive, and the graphics are pleasant enough in all their simplicity. My only slight gripe with the game comes from its few heavily compressed animated cutscenes which could've looked smoother.The game will initially take you about 8-12 hours to finish, but it has three different characters with different storylines and slightly different events, and I strongly suggest that you take the time to finish the game with every character if you want to get the most out of it and its story. As such, the replay value is strong especially if you're going for achievements which the game is almost designed for with its multiple difficulties, unlockables and the boss rush mode where you fight all the bosses of the game in a marathon setting. If going for full completion though, the replay value eventually depletes and the process turns into more of a grind towards the end of it.The combat consists of slashing and blasting through numbers of enemies with a combination of regular and special attacks while jumping around platforms and structures, avoiding enemy hits and collecting the currency and temporary power ups that they drop, all while the speedy and melodic soundtrack is playing at the background. Most of the depth and challenge comes from the tried and true mechanic of dodging and timing, which is very apparent in the several boss fights the game will throw at you. On harder difficulties you'll have to retry several times to get the patterns down properly, and while you can overlevel yourself by one or two levels with some extra grind to make many bosses noticeably more doable, in boss rush you have no such luxury. On the other hand if you just want to sit back and chill, the game has easier difficulties as well.Overall, YS Origin is a simple but solid ARPG that I can recommend to anyone.			",6,0,0,5,0,0,0

												I bought this game a long time ago and let it sit in my Library for ages (like I'm sure we all do once Winter and Summer sales roll around. I like to think of doing so as letting the game ""age like a fine wine"" or something like that). Well, I finally blew the dust off the cover (metaphorically) and grabbed my gamepad to begin playing. I was met with a well-done anime-esque intro matched with beautiful music (including a sick electric guitar and violin, two of my favorites). If you are on the fence about buying this, make the jump. It feels so classic and nostalgic to so many of the older action-rpg titles yet handles well and looks beautiful (the graphics, in my opinion, aged rather well).  Buy it, you are sure to enjoy it if you are a fan of arpg's! ",254,33,4,35,14,4,25

												Ys Origin is an outstanding game. As an action/adventure, it lets you crawl run through dungeons with awesome music and big, bad bosses. The combat is fast-paced and satisfying, so much that you may want to grind even if you don't have to. Bosses range from challenging to hard, though you can choose them to be pushovers or soulcrushingly difficult depending on the difficulty level.The clear main focuses of the game are combat and boss battles, both of which are amazingly well done. In higher difficulties, bosses don't just get more health and damage; their abilities work differently and have shorter recovery times.Compared to Oath in Felghana, Origin has three playable characters in story mode, bonus modes such as arena, and is overall more polished, though it's a little more linear and less RPG-y.Hacking and slashing monsters has never been so much fun before.

												This is the first game of the Ys franchise that I've played and, frankly, I didn't expect very much from it. The idea of some janky JRPG with 3rd person action combat has always sounded weird and, from what little I've experienced, didn't work out too well. I come from the Final Fantasy line of games and use that as the barometer for whether or not a JRPG will be good, and look for those elements, and was less than optimistic going into Ys Origin, and on through the opening credits, but once the gameplay started, I was hooked. The controls are tight, everything is useful throughout the game, and it takes skill more than anything to make progress. A certain amount of grinding is necessary for your average gamer (read: everybody that isn't doing a speed playthrough and min/maxing like crazy), and knowledge of enemy attack patterns is crucial, but knowing character limitations and being able to execute around enemy patterns trumps everything. On top of that, the game is damn hard; I played through on normal and got lambasted. I can't remember a boss that I beat on the first try, and there were two difficulties above that, meaning that whenever I give nightmare a shot is going to live up to its name.As for the story, it's not on par with what I associate with an RPG, but it also doesn't feel like it's trying to tell a large, dynamic story, but instead just introduce a handful of characters and set the background for the other Ys games (it is Origin so I'll have to confirm any of this by playing the other games). From Yunica's perspective, it's a classic coming of age ""I can't do anything and basically become a God by the end"" kind of story.The in game art style reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics with more stuff going on, while the character portraits and cut scenes are appealing without being obtrusive. The music is also on point, keeping with Japanese gaming tradition.Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this game. It was a small investment during a steam sale, and now I want to go back and try out the rest of the Ys franchise. I recommend Ys Origin with a 8.5/10; it doesn't try to do too much in terms of story or gameplay, and opened up a whole new franchise to me.			",88,15,0,21,9,0,9

												First things first - I had no idea what this game was about when I bought it. It was cheap in a Steam Sale, and I thought 'Hey why not - lol backlog'. However, times are a changing, and it's no longer about buffing that backlog game count, but actually PLAYING GAMES. Yes, playing games. On steam.So, having finally gotten around to playing this game (thanks to Steam Roulette), I have to say I'm genuinly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's a simple RPG/Adventure game, with some very basic yet effective hack'n'slash mechanics. While it would be wrong to say it's similar to Devil May Cry in the way that the combat is simple, but at the same time a little frantic, it does help paint a similar picture. The most rewarding part of the entire experience are the Boss Battles. They're old school - patterns & phase based, rather than just being normal mobs with a crazy amount of HP, dealing insane damage. Nope, no spank'n'tank here - these bosses have patterns of attacks, and phase of attacks based on their HP. Classic. They're frustrating to the point of fanfare when you finally take them down, which is great. Games tend to skip over the challenge and frustration these days, which means gamers miss out on learning, resilience and fist pumping when they finally topple the♥♥♥♥♥♥that's blocked their way for the last hour. This game doesn't deny you that pleasure. I feel like I'm not really doing the game justice - if you're still unsure there are 10/11 youtube videos linked to my Steam Account of my playthrough, so you could always check those out too. Ultimately, give it a go and you might surprise yourself.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

												(Yes, all those hours are legit. I have played this game that much.)This is a darn good Action RPG. It's a fast paced, simple game that just hits the sweet spot between ""too long"" and ""too short"". The game is simple enough that you basically know what to do from beginning to end, but has enough variety to make it not feel mindless. It's damn fun smacking the crap out of enemies.Despite taking place in one location, a single 25 floor tower, the game has enough variety in its areas to keep it constantly fresh and entertaining, with new mechanics to work with and environments to traverse. It has a nice difficulty curve, with bosses that continually test your wit. If you're looking for a nice challenge, pick this game up and play it on hard. And its soundtrack is damn good. Seriously, go to Youtube right now and type ""Ys Origin - Genesis Beyond The Beginning"", and tell me it doesn't make you want to play this game. I got this for 10$ and would gladly have paid full price. It's got more than enough content and has three different protagonists with their own stories and mechanics, and it's consistently fun and challenging, while offering something for just about every type of gamer.

												Easily one of my favorite games on Steam.  I noticed some other reviewers saying that you shouldn't play this game if you haven't played other Ys games.  I don't agree: previous to this I think maybe I had played Wanderers from Ys (SNES) briefly and I had probably played 5-10 hours into Ys VI (PS2).  I think I got this on a Daily Deal, but it's worth paying full price.  The dungeons are beautiful, the music is spectacular, the action is superb.  I prefer this to Oath in Felghana or Ark of Napishtim - both great games, but I thought this had more charm.  Granted there aren't any towns, which is a departure, but I think pure dungeon crawling works well for this series.			",66,10,0,42,1,1,8

												This little gem of an ARPG [ARPG in the vein of Bastion, Alundra, or Zelda rather than Diablo] doesn't do a whole lot but what it does, it does extremely well.The story & setting are similar to the likes of Dredd and/or The Raid: Redemption in that this game takes place in a single tower. You start on the first floor as one of three characters (only two initially unlocked) and fight your way up, to deal with the baddie at the top. Along the way you can appreciate some awesome...[1] Boss fights. The Ys series is known for its boss fights and these are no exception. They're tough, without ever feeling cheap.[2] Pacing. The game typically involves 2 or 3 floors of regular enemies (who can be quite challenging!) between each boss fight. You'll usually need to explore these thoroughly in order to find the key to the boss and any equipment upgrades. Yet these intermediate sections don't overstay their welcome. And it's entirely possible to run through them if needed.[3] Polish. The camera works. The controls work. The game provides proper feedback. Everything feels smooth and responsive, which makes the game a joy to play purely at the tactile level.[4] The music. Ys music is awesome.On these strengths, I give the game a thumbs up. If you like old-school ARPGs, this one is sharp and sleek. It'll provide about 10-15 hours of gameplay for the first playthrough. If you really like it, it's then got two other characters as well as boss attack / timed modes (though, big surprise!, the leaderboard is dominated by cheaters).Do keep in mind, however, that this game doesn't offer as varied an experience as other RPGs. Gear progression is strictly linear. Though each boss and its levels have different environmental themes (sand, lava, etc), there's ultimately not much variety in setting. You certainly aren't doing any globe-trotting. The story is serviceable, rather than inspired. So know what you're getting into.DIFFICULTY RECOMMENDATION: Ys games can be tough, but provide a variety of difficulties to compensate. This one has very easy, easy, medium, hard, and nightmare. I, personally, wouldn't recommend ANYONE play below medium. If you don't want a challenge, then play a different game. As a veteran gamer, I chose to start on hard. A good choice. Challenging, but never insurmountable. I had to look up only one boss fight - mostly because I misunderstood a mechanic. When I did the boss attack mode on medium after, I beat most fights on my first try. I wouldn't recommend Nightmare for your first playthrough. It'll be tough to learn the fights while simultaneously worrying about timing, aim, and movement.			",144,53,0,34,8,0,27

												Do you like ARPG, awesome story and don't mind anime style? Well, then this is what you have been searching for your whole life.General Overview:As you start the game, you can select between playing Hugo and Yunica. Hugo is like an SMG, you can spam your basic attacks like crazy, but is slower than a slowpoke. And Yunica has oven mittens... oh, and an axe, and is quite mobile. After that you can choose your difficulty, whereas nightmare really is a nightmare, and easy for Hugo players (yes, I hate him and I can't play him).In this game, nightmare actually adds stuffs like attacks to the enemies, not just way more health and damage. Don't worry if you get stuck on a boss for 3+ hours in this mode.Upgrading your character is also possible. You get small crystals which are your ingame-coins. In Nightmare every crystal is 1 point worth. In every other difficulty, I think, the bigger crystals give way more points.The story:The goddesses are nowwhere to be found on Ys. It's your job to go to the surface and find them. Of course, they are in the giant Darm Tower, the lair of the evil guys. Depending on which character you play, the story changes a bit. You get a few different bosses and other cutscenes. Due to this, you want to play it again, just to see how everything plays out for each character.Overall, to leave it mostly spoilerfree: Each story had it's emotional part and was well thought-out.Gameplay:Hugo: Will make your hands hurt (You should map a key to autopress the shoot button 30x a second)Yunica: Solid Movement, good attack speed, fun to play and mittens.There are a lot of enemies. Some are just powered up versions of older enemies, others are completely new. Especially on Nightmare difficulty you have to be very carefully to choose how to deal with the enemy. Some are almost completely immun to your skills. Learing the patterns of your foes helps a great deal.Setting:You play in a huge tower. However, this doesn't mean the interior is all the same. Every time after one of the bigger bosses, the tower changes completely. One time you play with lava, the other time you play with sand and also mirrors!Unlockables:Yes, this game has unlockables. Once you complete the game with any character, you unlock something awesome and the boss rush mode. After you finish the game with every character, you get the arena mode and a shop. In the first you defeat enemies for points, which then can be exchanged for stuff in the latter one. The shop allows you to buy many things, like powered up spells, Hugo still sucks though.Soundtrack:Just listen to the trailer music. It's so awesome! The rest is also pretty good.Long story short:Buy it, so we get even more Ys on steam!			",243,54,1,52,22,4,23

												Reminds me of all those RPG's I played as a child. LOTS of grinding invovled in this game, I could have used just a bit less of it, but it's not as bad as Oath in Felghana. Three different characters give it lots of replayability, and I've played through two. Fun game, and awesome soundtrack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily one of my favorite games on Steam.  I noticed some other reviewers saying that you shouldn't play this game if you haven't played other Ys games.  I don't agree: previous to this I think maybe I had played Wanderers from Ys (SNES) briefly and I had probably played 5-10 hours into Ys VI (PS2).  I think I got this on a Daily Deal, but it's worth paying full price.  The dungeons are beautiful, the music is spectacular, the action is superb.  I prefer this to Oath in Felghana or Ark of Napishtim - both great games, but I thought this had more charm.  Granted there aren't any towns, which is a departure, but I think pure dungeon crawling works well for this series.			",66,10,0,42,1,1,8

												I really recommend this game. Aside from the long intro, the gameplay is awesome and fun -- especially as Hugo and the secret character. The best part is that you don't have to use Yunica.  I like how the boss monsters are unique from the action RPGs I played. Where you can use their body parts as a means to defeat them. Sometimes the dungeons can be annoying but in a good way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is simply amazing, if you are a fan of old school Zelda this is for you!Game can be a grind at times to beat certain bosses, but not required as the boss mechanics can be very fun to learn and easy to dodge. I played through the story on the first time as Yunica and felt very connected to the character and was happy to see the progression she had made throughout the story from an apprentice knight to a full pledged knight.Don't let the long intro at the start of the game bring you down because it is unskippable because once that is all over the hack n' slash begins!

												The Ys series is old, having started back in 1987. One of the first action-oriented JRPGs, and one of the few series that still sticks around today. There's a reason for that, it's a series that has evolved over time without losing it's roots. It's still all about running around, killing monsters, growing stronger, finding key items and fighting challenging bosses.In that, it's pretty much a cousin to the Legend of Zelda. It does have it's own style of combat, and it's own setting (generic by today's standards, but when the series was new it was one that helped build the stereotypes) and each entry tends to have it's own twists and tricks. This is one of the later entries to the series, and uses 3d environments with good-looking 2d spritework for the characters. It mostly sticks to overhead view, but there's sections that twist the viewpoint along the way.story-wise it's the prequel to the story. As such, the mainstay hero swordsman Adol is nowhere in sight yet, and instead you have 2 playable characters with their unique playstyle (with a 3rd one to unlock).Each character has a different playstyle, and gets different special skills to use.Pros:- Game provides a good challenge on Normal difficulty, ramping up quickly but smoothly. Easier & harder difficulties are also available.- Bosses are memorable, with fairly tricky attack patterns at times (and mostly references to the bosses from earlier games in the series)- The playable characters do handle completely different, adding replayability- Crisp high-res artwork, holding up well today even though the original Japanese version of the game dates back to 2006- Pretty cool soundtrack- One of the playable characters is a non-sexualized, non-stereotypical female protagonist. That seems to be a big deal in this day and age so I'll list it as a pro.- Plenty of customization options. (if using a gamepad, you will want to remap the pause/menu button though - for some sillt reason it's not mapped to start button by default)- Solid controls- Update: Unlockable bonus modes, with leaderboards and all, which start unlocking once you complete the gameCons:- While good-looking, there isn't that much variety in the different environments you'll run through- There's a couple of weird things, like a key equipable item not being in the equipment screen, but tucked away in between the usable items instead.- No auto-saving. This being an old-school game it uses a savepoint mechanism, which works well. What's weird is that savepoints do work as checkpoints when you die, but don't auto-save to an actual save game.- Non-skippable cutscenes. Which is annoying if you want to start a new game but can't skip the minutes-long opening movie to get into the action. Update: At least the long animated scenes become skippable after you complete the game once. So it's mostly annoying if (like me) you want to try both initial characters without beating the game first.			",408,75,10,33,20,4,55

												Some games I buy for the story.Some games I buy for the gameplay,Other games I guy for the music.In the case Ys Origin I bought it for the gameplay and musicHowever, that is not to say that the story of this game is it weakness.It have several  stories to tell, although very similar are different enough to deserve a play through of every one of them.The music, as I said before, is an great reason to buy it since it is so well tuned to the gameand gives you an certain nostalgia.The weakness of the game however is what all rpg can suffer from, the difficulty can be a matter of levels, not skill. This can result to you having to do some exp grindingHowever, thankfully Ys Origin gives you something for that trouble in the way of unlocking lore as you kill monsters.That said, the actual fights can be fun and gives you the ability to chose how you want to play the characterAnd finally you may as yourselves “Which game should I play first? Ys 1 or Ys Origin?”Since both the first game an Origin has spoiler for each others it can be a hard choice.However, I recommend playing Origin first since I enjoyed interacting with a certain character in Ys 1 more than I would otherwise had if I hadn't played Origin first.And  if you are only able to pick one of Ys games for now, make it Origin as it will probably give you a better lasting experience than the other games.

												Fun and quick action RPG with fluid controls, loveable characters, a great soundtrack, and an interesting story that only fully unfolds after playing through with all 3 playable characters. Each has a different enough style of play that the game stands up to being played through 3 times in succession, and a range of difficulty levels and bonus modes round the package off nicely. Great localisation from XSEED, too. The giant bosses steal the show, each requiring some smart tactics to defeat- watch their movements and react accordingly since brute force and level grinding won't save you here!

												This is the first YS game that i've ever played, and, i gotta say that this game is, incredibly impressive. Ys Origin is a 3D Action RPG game, a fast paced one at that, developed by Nihon Falcom.In Ys Origin, you could play as either Yunica, a girl that wield a heavy battleaxe, or Hugo, the prodigy of magic. (There's a 3rd playable character, which is unlockable after you complete the game with either Hugo or Yunica)So, now to the review as always !Pros (+)- Story, it's pretty decent i would say ! Each characters have their own stories (and playstyle), which is awesome. There's a lot of reason to do another run in this game. I personally love Hugo's storyline.- Playtime, There's 3 playable characters, it takes about 10 hours more or less to complete the game, also, there's some extra after finishing the game, so, no need to worry.- Soundtrack, it depends on each own preferences, but i gotta say, you'll most likely, loves the soundtrack. It really fits the game and adds a lot to the immersiveness.- Controls, the controls feels really responsive.- Challenging, the difficulty feels right. The boss fight is totally fair, there's no unfair attack that leads to sudden death all out of nowhere. It's required to learn the behaviour or pattern of the enemies here. There's also difficulty option.- Progression ! Level, Move based artifacts, blessings, you will find a new playstyle along the stories.- Artstyle, again, it depends on preferences, but personally, i find it to be unique and ended up loving it a lot.Cons (-)- This game could be, a bit... grindy. If you're not good at this kind of games. At least, that happens to me, ahaha.- The enviroment feels a bit monotonous, well, we're inside a tower so.... yeah.Conclusion :So to sum it up, this game has, a good story, awesome soundtrack, great amount of playtime, good enemies & boss design, and the progression also feels nice. Pretty much, it has, everything you need to make a good RPG games !So if you love a fast-paced, 3D action games, i totally recommend it for you.			",276,73,7,26,16,4,15

												There's a lot to like about this game. The real-time, fast-action combat stands out from a lot of other Japanese titles that you might be tempted to compare it to. The enemy variety and challenging bosses can get frustrating, but are nonetheless thrilling to overcome. A couple bonus modes add variety to those of you looking for time-based challenges. Two starting characters and one unlockable one give some plot variety, including an alternative ending if you complete it as the secret character.Also? The soundtrack... it rules.

Having not played an Ys game before I thought I might be lost but I was not. And the music, omg the music, I went and bought the soundtrack because I can't live without the music! The game also has many different modes that are unlocked once you beat the game, and continue beating it. It never ends... Thank goodness! :D			",99,17,1,29,4,0,3

												My first Ys game, since I came to know the series late... I figured I would play the games in chronological order.I'd heard lots about the Ys music and even heard some from watching twitch streams/youtube videos of the other games. But I never expected to feel the way I did watching the opening cinema, fighting the bosses and overall beating the game. Much of the excitment and enjoyability of the Ys games is their music, and this title certainly delivered and surpased my expectations. Another staple of the frnachise is its incredibly difficulty, especially on the boss fights. I decided that for my first playthrough I would choose the ""normal"" difficulty, and my overall consesnsus was that it felt like what any other game would try to pass as a hard mode. However, grinding and searching for all secret items will help TREMENDOUSLY. Overall this was an amazing experience... I love the lore of the Ys franchise so far and can't wait to dive into the first game. I would highly reccomend this to anyone regardless of if you've played another Ys game or not.

												Whether you played the other series or not, this game is not to be missed for any JRPG fans.Yes, this game does not have an insane number of customisable skills, stats and equipments, or any potions you can keep for that matter, like Final Fantasy or the like. But you'll be too busy mashing the attack button to realise.This game is also fun and compelling enough to play through all the characters for their individual stories and skillsets, even if you're not an achievement hunter. Note: Be prepared if you're an achievement hunter though, this game is totally unfair on the hardest difficulty setting.Final words of advice if you get this game. Take breaks when playing this game, as in go do something else for the rest of the day. You just might not get carpal tunnel like I did. I had that much fun =D.			",158,54,0,22,21,0,21

Story is pretty damn good as well, and may shed backlight on the previous Ys games(In lorewise, this game is the first).Top it all off it's fast-paced, and challenging, given no potions to heal you except drops from enemies.

												The boss fights are generally better and it has the most fun to play as playable character in the series. But it is not as good as Oath. I think its because it feels more padded out. In order to unlock the true final boss you need to run through the same sets of levels in the same order twice as different characters, to unlock the bonus arena mode you have to run through the same game three times as different characters.The game is also a lot more wordy than Oath, with all three of the playable characters being unbearably whiny and having daddy issues. Music also took a step down from Oath, most of the non-boss music feels really limp and underwhelming.Though the boss fights are probably some of the best in the series, and a game that is worse than Oath is still a game worth buying. Just if you're going to buy only one of these, get Oath instead.			",469,104,7,50,18,4,32

												Ys Origin isn't for Ys neophytes - it help a lot if you've played Ys I & II before, since you'll get the most out of the story this way (and understand a lot of the references as well). But the game itself is probably the most polished of all the Ys games on Steam. From the silky smooth 60fps gameplay to the surprisingly decent graphics (and pretty impressive bosses), Origin does a great job graphically despite being an older game. The music of couse kicks♥♥♥♥♥ although I'd put it a notch below the music from Oath in Felghana and Ys I & II. The game is strange in that it doesn't star Adol Christin - instead, three different characters are available to play. To get the most out of the game, you'd need to finish the game with all three characters. In some ways it's rather repetitive since the puzzles and situations don't change much, but the way the characters play differ greatly - especially Hugo, who makes the game almost like a shoot-em-up. Still, it's great to see the story unfold from different perspectives. For Ys fans, this game is a no-brainer - highly satisfying gameplay, good, silky smooth graphics and rocking music. Who could ask for more? 8/10.			",217,115,2,36,11,2,15

												I simply have no words to describe how incredible Ys Origin is. There are 3 playable characters with slightly different stories along with few different boss fights and each one of our heroes have a unique combat system, so you will have at least 60 hours to complete the entire storyline. This game is a true masterpiece in every aspect, like music (as always), art style for the characters design (anime-like), beautiful graphics. Get it, you won't regret.			",193,19,6,13,9,1,6

												Fast paced, hack'n'slash, simple but fun RPG, that's how i describe this game!Around 10 hours of gameplay, but if you're like me, and enjoy exploring every inch of every level, then that'll be a little bit longer!! HehehYou get to control 1 of 3 characters (one of those you unlock when you finish the game), every one of 'em has a different story, but the main storyline is the same. Gameplay'wise, they have a basic attack and 3 different skills for their weapons and the game is really fast paced!! Boss fights are really cool! :)The game is a lil' bit hard at the beginning, but once you get used to it, things get a lot easier!Even tho' i say it's easy, it's not hard to find yourself some tougher enemies and get killed... So here's my tip: ALWAYS save your progression... Seriously!!It gets kinda annoying when you have been playing like 30+ minutes without saving the game and then, all of a sudden, a big pack of tougher and faster enemies apears and you die, losing those 30+ minutes of UNsaved gameplay! And the worst is, you'll have to do it all over again!!! So yeah... SAVE!This game is pretty cool, nice soundtrack, simple but good story, fast paced action and so on... The only problem with the game is that, most of your alies are kinda dull and easily forgettable! Only enemies and a few alies are pretty cool... But the other ones, you just finish the game and don't even remember their names!!Other than that, iz all gud! I recommend it! ;)			",224,19,3,30,7,1,6

												I picked this game up on sale after wanting a really good JRPG, or rather an action platformer. With a good combat system and a strong, responsive, gameplay methodology the game is a winner. You can complete the game inside of 10-20 hours depending on difficulty setting and past that there is a tonne of replay-ability through either doing it on harder modes or in playing the game again from another character's point of view (there are 2 characters to choose from at the start, a third being added at the end). It's well worth whatever price you pick it up for, though if you're not sure you'll like it (it grows on you), I would recommend at least snagging it on a sale. Basically, it's Zelda on the PC in 1080p, or rather a Zelda-esque game.Story: 8/10I played through the game on hard as 'Yunica Tovah', aka, Axe Girl. Being more of a agility-speed player it was my natural choice as I've never been that into mage characters, which is the other character model available as you start the game fresh. As a character Yunica is more or less your bumbling anime girl that has inner strength that expresses itself as impatience and immaturity, which naturally changes over time. I found her interesting - a little predictable at times, but as the plot progresses she does develop more facets and towards the end her angry side really is a welcome extension of her persona. As for the overall story and setting, I found them engaging and enjoyable. It's definitely a fantasy game firmly within in the anime genre, and if you like that then you'll love the game. Me, personally, I can take it or leave it, so for me the it would be the gameplay that would swing me on this.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay is fantastic. Fluid, sharp, and precise. Everything I like and enjoy. As a new player to this type of game it only took a quick control re-mapping to something more western - WASD as apposed to ZXCV - and then I picked it up pretty quickly. The gameplay is great because you have a really well thought out of mix of trash mobs, mid-level, high-level, then boss-level type enemies. And towards the end-game they start mixing in conditions and aoe gravity pulls to really start tripping you up if you haven't mastered how to pick off certain enemies. And that's what the gameplay really is at heart: you get thrust into a new situation and you have to adapt to these new conditions pretty quickly through piecing together enemy attacks, patterns, strengths, and weaknesses. This is especially true of the boss fights, which were always thoroughly enjoyable, challenging, and at times, a little frustrating. All of which are designations of a good game.Difficulty is king here. If you have it on easy, you'll somewhat breeze through the game. Greater difficulties are just that in this game - it's not the western version of difficulty where 'Veteran' is what 'Easy' used to be in the late 90s, Nightmare literally means Hell.  I didn't give the gameplay 10/10 because of one reason: if you miss a chance to power up your weapon and you progress to the next stage, you'll suddenly hit a spike in difficulty. The same can be said if you don't more or less flatten the majority of enemies on contact (at first). So this can be a little infuriating as you suddenly can hit grind mode, unless you go back and find that missing upgrade. But, the good news is there's a transport system so it's not difficult at all. And, worse comes to worse, you can always use GameFAQs to trace your steps to that upgrade. Game design: 8/10This game is obviously Japanese in regards to design which naturally means that some inherent Western expectations aren't fulfilled. This takes the form of, or rather, a lack of:A nice looking menuThe ability to map controls inside the game (instead of inside the launcher only)The ability to skip cutscenes - even if you've already seen themThese are gripes that you get used to and they're only mildly annoying. If you're a JRPG fan, well, you're used to this kind of thing anyway. Level design throughout is interesting and never repetitive; effectively think of the game as like a Mario or Zelda game: you're always in one 'general area' but as you go progress through the levels/stages the scenary changes etc, such as Ice to Fire to Sand and so on. It's classical and is nice to go through again if I'm honest. These different stages bring with them different unique challenges that do require a bit of trial and error occasionally, which I feel is a good thing. Not enough games punish you for messing up, this one does punish you; but never in an unfair way. I like that method of design.Conclusion: 8.5/10Highly recommended if you want an old school experience in 1080p that is reminiscent of Zelda and old school Mario. It's a great game with solid gameplay elements and the story is engaging and interesting. If you're an anime fan then I'm certain you'll find worth in this game. If you're not an anime fan then your opinion will likely differ, maybe drastically so. But regardless, the gameplay is super strong and rewarding, so if you want a challenge then this is it. If you're in the unsure camp like I was, wait for a price reduction via sale then snap it up.			",51,6,2,16,2,0,8

												Very well detailed game with differing storylines depending on which of the three characters you play. From the beginning on, it teaches you the game while playing out the storyline at a set pace. There are a few pros/cons that I want to discuss, though.Pros:-Good graphics and a beautiful, original soundtrack.-Different characters and unlocks for the game.-Multiple endings depending on the character you play.-Amazing storyline!Cons:-NOT Gamepad compatable instructions ingame, all instructions are based for computers.-The same ending regardless. Come on, you have to have one ending that ends well for everyone, right?-Heavy grind game, if you play on the harder difficulties with Yunica or Hugo, expect more grinding than with The Claw.Very good buy, especially if you're a fan for awesome stories and fun (Yet punishing) games.

												Great game.  3 story characters to play as. (You need to unlock one). While they all tranverse the same levels they have a few differences in bosses but mostly story wise. They also each play differently. One weilds an axe, one is a mage, and the unlockable is a berserker.Spoiler: Toal, the unlockable chraracter, is the character with the canon storyline and true final boss. 	That said I felt the game had a great story and very worth its price, and with each character getting their own storyline it gives you a reason to play them all. Difficultly ranges from Very Easy to Nightmare. Upgradable skills/traits. You have to find your gear upgrades there is no shop to buy them from. Fear not since the gear upgrades are either in chest or given to you. No RNG luck based element to make you spend your days grinding instead of playing.Bosses have gimmicks but they also for the most part seem to follow a pattern. Though the gimmicks each boss have can be enough to prevent you from winning on your first encounter with them, and 2nd, maybe 3rd. This isn't a bad thing. It requires you to actually learn how the boss works if you want to beat them instead of just brute forcing it.That said I would just like to point out a couple of cons.1. Keyboard controls for the most part are fluent but on a certain boss they are a bit chunky.2. The same above applies to trying to fight flying enemies. I would suggest a gamepad if you have one.That said I am a keyboard player and still find it around 95% fluent. Perfectly acceptable.			",79,6,0,6,2,0,2

												Ys Origin isn't for Ys neophytes - it help a lot if you've played Ys I & II before, since you'll get the most out of the story this way (and understand a lot of the references as well). But the game itself is probably the most polished of all the Ys games on Steam. From the silky smooth 60fps gameplay to the surprisingly decent graphics (and pretty impressive bosses), Origin does a great job graphically despite being an older game. The music of couse kicks♥♥♥♥♥ although I'd put it a notch below the music from Oath in Felghana and Ys I & II. The game is strange in that it doesn't star Adol Christin - instead, three different characters are available to play. To get the most out of the game, you'd need to finish the game with all three characters. In some ways it's rather repetitive since the puzzles and situations don't change much, but the way the characters play differ greatly - especially Hugo, who makes the game almost like a shoot-em-up. Still, it's great to see the story unfold from different perspectives. For Ys fans, this game is a no-brainer - highly satisfying gameplay, good, silky smooth graphics and rocking music. Who could ask for more? 8/10.			",217,115,2,36,11,2,15

												Just bought this game because it was on sale and figure I'd give a chance. Never played the franchise before but I have been pleaseantly surprised so far. If you love action rpgs like castlevania:sympothy of night or Top down action games like Zelda: Link to the past then try this game out. They blend those genres really well. Despite its 2d aesthic the game is actually 3d so you can also jump around, adding potential for greater puzzle/platformig depth and exploration. In the end it's great mix of action, and light puzzl/platforming, and rpg. Has that charming old school vibe to it but with extremly fluid controls. And the music is great and the sound effects help bring you back to that old school action jrpg genre nostalgia. Great game and I'm only 2 bosses and 1hr plus in. I can all ready tell I'm gonna love this title.			",98,22,0,17,6,0,2

												I tend to be weary of japanese game ports. The PC gaming market is small over there, and it's common for developers to misunderstand PC expectations. Moreover, these types of games attract a passionate fanbase, who will often overlook technical flaws in their reviews.Good news: none of this applies to Ys Origin. The game runs at 60 frames per second without a hitch. Widescreen resolutions are properly supported. There is minimal letterboxing on menus, but devs have added additional graphics on the sides (rather than black bars), a nice touch. 7 hours in, I haven't been able to spot a single bug or glitch. Keyboard controls are implemented and the various tutorial screens actually reference these keys rather than gamepad prompts.As for the gameplay itself, other reviews give a good overview so there's hardly any need to expand on this. Personal recommandation, don't let your ego get in the way of a fun experience. As someone who finds the Dark Souls series' reputation for punishing difficulty to be largely overblown (and I love all Dark Souls games), Ys Origin's demo boss still handed my♥♥♥♥♥to me several times on Normal difficulty. Picking Easy for my real playthrough after buying the game, so far it has been appropriately challenging. Also worth noting leveling seems to be important in this game. Sometimes, getting two extra levels can be the difference between hitting a boss for 1 damage per hit or 10 damage per hit (those numbers might seem paltry either way, but when you think about it, the latter hits ten times harder). On Easy there hasn't been any need to grind experience so far.Overall, an excellent game. -75% discounts come and go on a regular basis, and at that price it's a steal if you're even remotely interested in the genre. Heck, I don't even like anime, but one can only stay grumpy for so long in the face of sheer fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Time attack, and arena do not count since you only unlock slightly modified versions of the characters.-If you are trying to get on the leaderboards, don't, it is littered with obvious cheaters.-Controls will sometimes stick causing a death.-The large delays on all actions will bring about alot of uneccessary hits.-game will sometimes speed up.Pros:-Very fluid gameplay aside from above.-Leveling system that allows for challenge playthroughs. Prepare to rip your hair out.-Difficulty levels ranging from the ""I'm new to this genre"" to ""Lets get right to banging my head on the wall"". Bosses gain new skills, hp, and defense for every difficulty.-3 possible stories with only one being canon for the series. Each one giving unique insights into the type of person each character is.-Schoolgirl outfit.-Graphics are average.			",88,25,0,26,4,0,4

No towns or villages.-Can't skip scenes (Gets more irritating near the end of game.)			",79,23,3,23,2,1,5

												Outside of an awful RTS spinoff on the DS Origin was my first real taste of the Ys series, and it was a taste so good I've continued to buy up all subsequent releases on PC. An action RPG comprising of three separate character journeys through a rather large and complex tower, featuring many natural obstacles and puzzles to overcome. The game is certainly challenging with a combat system that is easy to get used to and offers layers of options to your fighting. You're likely to die to each boss as you figure out the tactics, making it so satisfying when you do break through. There are few other games that have demanded so much attention and kept me hooked throughout the way that Origin has done.You can read a full review of this game here.[www.neoseeker.com] ",352,119,16,50,12,2,14

Ys Origin is built on what is possibly the best ARPG engine out there, featuring fast and tense combat with responsive controls that requires a little strategic thinking.  On top of that, the graphics manage to be impressively beautiful while retaining excellent system performance.  The plot's pretty good, too - about as straightforward as you'd expect in a game like this, but I think the character development carries it, and the fact that there are three slightly different versions of it (one of which is unlocked by clearing the game once, has you initially fighting against the other protagonists, and includes additional plot revelations) improves replayability.I do feel, though, like Falcom made a mistake with the difficulty levels and achievements - many mistakes, actually.  For starters, SP (points for buying ability upgrades) gain rates are tied to difficulty level, and some upgrades are so exorbitantly expensive that getting the related achievements is only feasible by playing through and farming on the lowest difficulty level, which is so easy as to be boring.  That's not the really crazy part, though.  The crazy part is the extra outfit for one of the characters - let me say that again: it's just an alternate sprite, and an achievement to go with it - that requires beating the game at least 6 times, including 3 on nightmare difficulty, plus spending a lot of time in Arena Mode.  Even if you just want to fight the unlockable optional boss, which I kinda do, you'll still have to do the 3 Nightmare runs and the grinding in Arena Mode.  Now, I do have to give Falcom credit for making the higher difficulty levels challenging in ways that are a little more creative than damage dealt/taken adjustments.  I already mentioned the SP gain rates (I think EXP is also affected to a lesser degree), and your special abilities have longer cooldowns, but the most noticeable difference is in the enemy AI: on higher difficulty levels, enemies will attack more frequently and aggressively, with bosses in particular saturating their lairs with hazards to your health, making the game not just more difficult, but also more exciting.  Unfortunately, though, your chances of surviving still come down to experience level.  A single level gain makes the difference between a boss fight you have absolutely no hope of winning and a boss fight you can probably clear with your character just barely still breathing if you practice a few times.  Upgrades, of course, help too.  And, remember, farming is slower on higher difficulties.  What this means is that a Nightmare playthrough is basically a long, tedious grindfest punctuated by occasional intense boss battles.  It doesn't help that all the dialogue, which ordinarily I'd appreciate, is all unskippable, and there's sometimes a lot of it immediately before a boss.  I had been planning on getting as close to 100% completion as I reasonably could (Caress of Steel?  Ha, ha, NO.), but having beating the game once with each of the three characters, including one Nightmare run, and cleared all but the last arena stage multiple times, it's gotten too repetitive, and I'm kinda sick of it now.  Uninstalling for my own sanity.			",342,170,8,99,29,5,60

												Forget how Anime or cutesy it looks - this is one of the best action adventure platformers i've ever played. The combat is fast and fulfilling and the boss fights are incredibly fun and very challenging - you MUST like boss fights or else the gameplay won't have much appeal to you. The game kind of reminds me of Zelda in that you fight your way through differently themed stages/levels (dungeons/temples) with the sole objective of reaching the level's boss. Although don't go thinking that the game offers anything more than pure, fast-paced action and a lightish story.This is the first Ys game I've played and now I'm hooked. I can see why the Ys series has a dedicated following. On to play The Oath in Felghana next!			",283,101,8,23,27,2,46

												J-Just.... THE EMERSION! A game that, to me, gave a really good bonding experience with the playable characters. Good difficulty and balance, yet still the possibility to easily gain some more fighting strength for tough fights. Not many games do, but this game gave me that empty feeling of sadness when it was over. I was forced to consider what just occured, and the meaning of it. And let me tell you, my conclusion wasn't a happy one. Knowing that your character was done and that you would never again experience the same thing is not very pleasant in this case. This is something I rarely see in the modern gaming genres. I want to mention a couple of things to those who have doubts about this game.It's a japanese game, so it does have some anime-esk cut-scenes and images. Yet, these occur very rarely, so do not be concerned if you think this would bother you (Though, seriously, why would it?). It's an old game, don't look for good graphics and such. Though, that's not what you primarily should be looking for in a game. The gameplay feels smooth and fast-paced, something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Characters that are extremely unique and different from one another. Discovering the plot feels utterly fantastic. Any time something plot-related occured in between my beat up sequences, I couldn't help but let my excitement lead me through the dialogues. Remember when I mentioned I felt really empty and sad about my character that I played? How I wasn't going to be able to see her anymore? Well, that happened with not only that one, but some NPCs as well. Definitely an achievement.Something more about difficulty. The game has 5 difficulty settings, two above and below normal. This makes it very suitable for people of all skill levels or interests. Keep in mind that you cannot change your difficulty throughout the game, yet this is also not necessary as you will always be able to beat the boss without exception because of the possibility to grind a level or two. Not once have I felt like a boss was truly overpowered. Rather, that I, myself, was underpowered. And that is something that's easy to fix. Now, something I really appreciate about this game is that you have 3 playable characters. One of which is unlocked by finishing the game with one of the other two. This is because the final one is the hardest one to play and to minimize sploilers for the other two. The reason for that is something you will have to find out for yourself. The last one also has the one true story, meaning, the heaviest plot. This gives the game amazing replayability. That is about the best I can give you. If this has not cleared things up for you regarding gameplay and such, I'd say you oughta simply look up a video and see for yourself. Try to minimize spoilers, however! So, to conclude my review, this game is heavily recommended by myself among others.			",82,5,1,5,3,0,1

												Score: 8.5 / 10I haven't 100%'d the game yet, but I feel like I'm ready to review it after 120 hours of gameplay and 3 playthroughs on nightmare on all characters.I have played three games from the Ys series so far (Ys I & II, Origin and Felghana) and each one of them clearly shows the extreme effort Falcom and XSEED put into every aspect of the game: super smooth gameplay with solid mechanics and very few bugs or inconsistencies, pretty challenging difficulty, excellent performance, very flexible settings that support even 120hz and up monitors and modern resolutions, the portings are very compatible with modern OSes even though these games are from 2006 and earlier, the anime graphics and the artwork are sweet and pleasant (but not necessarily ultra detailed) and the soundtracks are masterpieces.In poor words, Falcom consistently does a great job in every aspect of the game and puts a great effort into making every detail perfect and solid. Both the engines of Ys I & II and Origin & Felghana have the perfect balance between graphics, performance and gameplay quality.I won't talk too much about the plot because I usually don't care about that stuff.Ys Origin is a prequel set 700 years before the events of Ys I & II and tells about the past of Ys, the twin goddesses, the black pearl and Solomon Shrine. Most of humanity fled to Solomon Shrine (which is on a floating island up in the sky), as the surface got taken over by demons. For the very first time we're not playing as Adol. We will be playing as one member of a group of adventurers (you can choose between 3 characters) sent to investigate on the disappearance of the twin goddesses, who seem to be inside the Darm tower.Pro / Cons:+ = pro- = con- no more ""bump mechanics"" from Ys I & II. In my opinion, this combat system was unique and kinda set Ys apart from other action RPG's, also it made boss fights a bit more challenging. Ys Origin & other newer Ys games ditched that system for more generic hack n slash mechanics + magic which is okay but nothing special.- the game takes place entirely inside of the Darm Tower, so there is not that much variety environment-wise.- while Ys I had very short but extremely fast & challenging boss fights (except for a few bosses with bugged AI's), the boss fights on Ys Origin are slow and long, and since the bosses heavily rely on RNG, defeating a boss on Nightmare difficulty is 50% skill 50% luck unless you overlevel to fight that luck factor. Either way, there is too much luck involved in boss fights, and sometimes it can become frustrating even if you can actually beat the boss 100% of the times. This also makes boss rush / time attack extremely tedious and frustrating especially on Nightmare where you will be barely equipped to beat the boss. In Ys I & II, on the other hand, the boss fights were 100% skill based and used nearly no RNG-based attacks, but they were so challenging that you had to practice for a bit to master them even if you memorized them, so the results of the boss fights scaled directly with the player's skill.- there is a lot more grinding required, too much for my tastes. Leveling up for bosses takes much longer and filling the monster book is now random instead of having to kill each mob 31 times.- the dialogue can be sped up but not skipped. this can be frustrating when playing through the game multiple times.- the save system does not allow you anymore to save anywhere - you can teleport to save points, but you will have to save there so that adds some useless backtracking when saving before dangerous situations. On the other hand, the teleport system is handy to quickly teleport to every area of the game, but a system like the wings in Ys II would've been enough.- Alt + F4'ing the game has a chance to corrupt your monster book+ a playthrough takes about 10 hours if you kill all of the bosses first try and 20-30+ hours if you take a few tries to beat each boss, which is pretty optimal for multiple playthroughs or speedruns.+ amazing soundtrack with lots of remasters of the original darm tower musics in Ys I+ lots of references to Ys I & II: remastered bosses, lots of monsters in common, lots of remastered music, some key items in common and the plot is nicely linked and properly explains all of the backstory behind Ys I.+ very high replay value: each character sees the story from an entirely different perspective, will encounter slightly different bosses and each character's boss fight is balanced differently. There's also an arena mode where you will be able to fight monsters from different areas of the game to gain SP you can use to unlock alternative versions of the characters and other bonus content, including a secret boss. Completing all of the achievements will take up to 6 playthroughs or more. There's also the usual monster book you have to fill by grinding all of the monsters in the game (some are missable), an upgrade system for your characters where you can spend SP earned from mobs, and various Roo's hidden around the game that will give you missable upgrades if you feed them Roda Fruits (also hidden & missable).+ the achievements where you have to beat two ""unbeatable"" boss that you normally have to lose to are pretty interesting challenges even though they're heavily rng based+ retrying bosses doesn't make you go through the dialogue all over again+ perfect support for the 360 joypad and ps3 joypad + ds3 tool+ the engine has a minimum guaranteed performance: for example, if there's too many effects on screen some of them will not display, that way there is always a guaranteed minimum framerate even in the worst scenario.+ the bosses partially retain the ""bullet hell on foot"" feel that Ys I & II had.It's not a masterpiece like Ys I & II, but it's an excellent game like most Falcom games and it's certainly worth the price. Highly recommended.			",212,20,5,34,6,0,10

												Ys Origin from Nihon Falcom is a Japanese take on the ARPG genre, so it's a JARPG I guess. I didn't really know what to expect when I started playing it but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The combat is solid and the graphics are charming.  Although you aren't given free reign to upgrade your character like a Western ARPG you level up as you kill monsters which strengthens your stats and you also gain SP by killing monsters which you can use to purchase upgrades for your character to increase passive stats such as Mana Cost for spells. Grinding is also well done in this game, if you kill the monsters as you advance through the game your character will be strong enough to defeat the bosses; however, if you're having trouble with a particular enemy you can grind up to increase your stats if you wish. Speaking of bosses, it was the best part about the game. The boss fights are well designed, challenging, but also fair. It's kind of a ""find the pattern"" type of deal, but there's a lot of skill involved in defeating the many bosses in the game. It had a Demon's Souls type of feel for the boss battles but the rest of the game had a Zelda-esque feel to it. The bosses were so fun I thought to myself while playing, ""it would be awesome if this game had a boss rush mode."" Little did I know, it does! It unlocks after you beat the game.While I enjoyed the game a lot, it did have a few problems. The game is linear, with you having to find a key or item to get to the next area and there isn't an open world as you're just going up a tower. That's not to say the environments aren't varied, as they are, it just means there isn't much exploring to do. There's also a bit too much backtracking for my taste, but it wasn't too excessive. The music is pretty low quality and repetative and the control settings aren't adjustable in-game (you have to use a separately loaded launcher) so if you don't have your controller settings set properly you have to exit the entire game to get it right; other than that the controller support in the game is quite good. There are three playable characters (one of which is unlockable), each of which gives you a different point of view on the narrative. The unlockable character is actually a demon as well, so you get the antagonist's point of view on the story which I found quite cool. The story itself is rather tropey, but still was a little more adult than other JRPGs I have played (it has swear words and death) which I enjoyed. The game loads and exits in a snap, which is also a plus.Pros:GameplayStoryline (multiple perspectives)3 Characters that play quite differently""Grinding"" done well for a JRPGBoss FightsUnlockables and Bonus Modes (with leaderboard support!)Excellent ReplayabilityCons:Music/AudioBacktrackingLinearityI really enjoyed this Japanese take on the ARPG genre. If you enjoy killer boss fights I'd recommend it for you. There's also a boss rush mode which is amazing for this game and many other unlockables to keep your interest in the game after you've beaten it. The three available characters all play differently and show you a different perspective on the events of the story and I'm really looking forward to coming back and playing this game again once I've finished the other games in my collection. There are a few negative aspects of Ys Origin (I really disliked the audio engineering) but they don't overbearingly detract from the fun I had with this game. A-NOTE: I did play Ys Oath in Felghana and I have to say I wasn't as impressed with that game as I was with this one.  The boss battles weren't as epic, grinding felt more necessary, the music was better (but still repetetive), and basically everything that was good about that game is in Origin, but there's a lot missing.  The protagonist is also silent (which hasn't been cool since Freeman did it), and there's only one playable character.  I would NOT recommend Oath, but Origin is great.  If you want more of the same gameplay, play the other characters on Origin - skip Oath unless you REALLY love the series.			",711,211,14,90,55,8,86

												Maybe my biggest surprise / gut purchase ever. Ys is one of those darling series where everyone seems to want to tell you how good it is yet few people have played. While I won't say it's become one of my favorite series, it's become one I've begun to follow, and it along with Trails in the Sky has put Falcom on my mental map when it comes to video games.Ys, pronounced something like ""ease"" with only the first letter capitalized and no apostrophe, is basically an action jrpg without random battles or a heavy story emphasis. There's a moderate amount of text dialogue but it's interesting enough and no voice acting to drag it down. Ys Origin is essentially a far prequel to the events of Ys I and II, also available on Steam but significantly more dated. You are given two choices of characters. Yunica provides gameplay more similar to that of series protagonist Adol, specilizing in close combat fighting. Hugo seems to be a more experimental playstyle for the series, focusing on long range magic attacks.I strongly suggest Yunica to be your first playthrough character for the game. Her playstyle is simply exceedingly more engaging than Hugo, who simply becomes a button spam unless playing at one of the more difficult settings. Luckily to unlock the third character you only need to beat the game as one of these two, which is nice if you want to experience the full canon story of the third character without slogging through a Hugo playthrough. Though you may find you don't mind and will want to play his story anyways.Ys Origin is a brief experience, which is good considering that if you want to see everything you have to play the game a few times. It also allows for replays and taking on higher difficulties if you find you truly want to master the battle system. While the common enemies may not offer much lateral thought in how you tackle them, the frequent and varied boss encounters are quite a relative spectacle and there's no re-skinning or re-hashing to be seen here. All of them are tackled in a different way.There is a plethora of music selections for each section of the tower. The whole soundtrack is great an I often found myself humming some of the more memorable tracks. There's also good variety, so finding a few floors with a theme you don't really care for is offset by knowing that a new track is just around the corner.Definietly consider it if you are looking for a unique jrpg without the bloat that SE or someone like NamcoBandai puts out these days.8.5/10			",99,12,0,27,2,0,17

												This game is anime as hell, with horrible pacing, painfully awkward(ly translated?) writing, cringeworthy story, setting and characters that it shoves in your face in lengthy, unskippable conversations and cutscenes.You should still totally play it, because once all that stuff takes a break this game is an addictively fun simple brawler with a limited but very satisfying moveset, basic but enjoyable rpg systems and very challenging (depending on your level and difficulty), varied and interesting boss fights - all supported with a catchy soundtrack.Don't expect Dark Souls though: if any encounter is too rough - likely because you're underleveled - it usually can be trivialized by grinding a room full of enemies for 15-30 minutes to get a handful of levels over the boss. There's also easier difficulties to pick if you don't feel like ""powerleveling"".The regular playthrough is a very decent length already, and the game is designed for multiple playthroughs with different characters with different abilities and boss encounters, so if you enjoy the gameplay the game certainly delivers tons of it.

												>Girl expert at close quarter combat>Guy expert at magic and long range attacksSeems legit.Mismatching aside, this is one of my favorite games. The boss battles are pretty hard -- there are no healing spells or resurrecting potions to keep you going. You have to be careful and dodge every attack and in Nightmare mode, the bosses are very durable. It takes patience, quick reflexes and level grinding isn't really that bad. This game also inspired me to revisit the good RPGs of the SNES and PS1 era. Chrono Trigger, here I come!			",171,26,5,23,8,0,12

												Ys Origin is a fantastic and surprising game. At the start it appears to be a fairly standard JRPG-esq story with the memorable and challenging hack and slash gameplay Ys is known for, but as you play through the game multiple times with each of the characters, what was first a simple, borderline cliche, if well executed tale becomes far more memorable, complex, and touching. No other game I've seen tells a story like it, and its a damn good story to boot. With memorable characters and story, fantastic gameplay, and a mindblowing soundtrack, there is little reason not to get Ys Origin as soon as you can.			",329,83,2,59,16,2,59

												This is a pretty amazing game. It may not look like much at first but believe me, once you start playing you'll enjoy every bit of it. The gameplay is solid and the boss fights keep you on your toes - every boss has some kind of weakness which you need to discover and then exploit in order to beat them (something you don't see very often). As for the story - it's AWESOME! Some may find it a little cliche but for me it offered a very enjoyable experience. In addition, you get to experience it through the eyes of three different characters - Yunika, Hugo and a mystery character (You unlock him after beating the game as either Yunika or Hugo)I personally had never played a game of this genre before (Japanese RPG) so I'm not really sure to which type of player to recomment it to... All I can say is that I've had a blast with it and definitely recommend it. :)			",203,26,19,21,7,3,23

												This game is what revived ARPGs for me. Fast paced combat, enough story to keep you mildly invested, and multiple characters to help fit more than one type of playstle. Ys Origin has many [noticible] flaws and successes, most of which make it the game it is today.Pros: 3 Playable characters- We have your battle axe wielding berserker-style teenager, your snooty mage, and your ""Git gud and unlock me"" Character. Each one plays differently because of movement, magic skills, or how well they can manage themselves in, what I like to call, ""crisis"" situations (instances where you end up in a terrible spot and thinking/reacting fast is your only means of survival"".Jumping- FINALLY, A GAME WHERE I CAN PLAY AN RPG, FIGHT IN REAL TIME, AND JUMP!!!! Moving in 3 dimensions makes platforming puzzles and combat reach another level of challenging.Puzzles- Puzzles are NEVER stupidly difficult and one particular puzzle can actually be solved without getting a ""mandatory"" upgrade nearby as 2 of the 3 characters. Puzzles are more meant to keep you from ""completely"" blitzing through the game.Story- Story is spaced out enough that it will never wholely interrupt your climb through the tower, but will still be there to keep you interestedBoss Fights- Probably the crowning achievement of Ys games, the boss fights will almost ALWAYS let you have a ton of fun on any difficulty (Yes, even people like me who are frustrated on higher difficulties still enjoy Nightmare mode/Inferno mode for Oath in Felghana). The fact that most of them keep the same pace, or even speed up a bit near the end of the fight, keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes victories that much sweeter.Difficulty select- You can't change once you start...but at the beginning there are multiple difficulties for the casual/hardcore masochist in all of us. Very Easy mode for the people who just want to beat the game, all the way up to Nightmare for the people who want to be challenged/punished for slightly better unlockable rewards.Music- FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING SACRED AND DEMONIC IN ALL WORLDS, THIS MUSIC IS AMAZING :L I am a SLAVE to the soundtracks in Ys games! Fanboying aside....we DO have many memorable tracks and a few that may put you to sleep (I'm looking at you 2nd sector >.<) but the tracks are all VERY good standalone....just not always for extended periods of time. The BGM will be the same for the ENTIRE time you are in a sector/until you enter a boss area, so get used to them.Cons- Combat playstyles- Each character can only really play one way...turning trash mob combat into tedium when you are a few levels shy of doing any real damage to enemies. Trash mobs WILL eventually turn into beat-em up sections if you need to go level grinding for any reason.Level to Damage scaling- You will get new armor and be able to upgrade your weapon as you play through the game but at the same time your level is just as dependant on your damage. If you are even 2 levels shy of where you ""should be"" you will do little to no damage. You will literally get a small damage/defense spike around certain levels just so you keep up, a pattern present in Ys: Oath in Felghana as well. The same applies to having a weapon too low level. I was at the 3rd boss of the game as the 1st playable character and I noticed I could barely do 2 damage to the guy. Turns out, I missed an upgrade partway through the tower section I was in; because the MOMENT I got it the boss was taking normalized damage again. Upgrade (as a result) are NOT optional, which may kill the game for you if you are playing on Hard/Nightmare and you are going in blind. Glitches- The game is relatively glitch-free from my 160-170 hours on record, but occasionally you will witness things like falling through a floor during an attack or clipping into things that stay relatively solid. Nothing too bad, but it did hurt a little getting to the true final boss and falling through the floor RIGHT as I pulled out my nuke move.Upgrades- Remember how I said upgrades ""should"" be optional in places? This is where the game has the potential to be a real deal breaker for some. Most RPGs have proven that treasure chests are relatively optional unless something you NEED is in them. Ys: Origin loves planting things that make not getting OHKO'd/combat even remotely possible late game IN treasure chests and then giving you free reign to ignore them. This is not a complaint, but this HAS halted/slowed the progress of a few people Ive helped out on the forums. You should ALWAYS go for chests you see...even if it looks like a pain in the butt to get if you want to have a decent time above Easy mode.Overall, I give this an 8/10, its EASILY one of my favorite games (especially out of my Steam Library) but even I can see where this game would♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off.

												This is a pretty amazing game. It may not look like much at first but believe me, once you start playing you'll enjoy every bit of it. The gameplay is solid and the boss fights keep you on your toes - every boss has some kind of weakness which you need to discover and then exploit in order to beat them (something you don't see very often). As for the story - it's AWESOME! Some may find it a little cliche but for me it offered a very enjoyable experience. In addition, you get to experience it through the eyes of three different characters - Yunika, Hugo and a mystery character (You unlock him after beating the game as either Yunika or Hugo)I personally had never played a game of this genre before (Japanese RPG) so I'm not really sure to which type of player to recomment it to...

												This game is what revived ARPGs for me. Fast paced combat, enough story to keep you mildly invested, and multiple characters to help fit more than one type of playstle. Ys Origin has many [noticible] flaws and successes, most of which make it the game it is today.Pros: 3 Playable characters- We have your battle axe wielding berserker-style teenager, your snooty mage, and your ""Git gud and unlock me"" Character. Each one plays differently because of movement, magic skills, or how well they can manage themselves in, what I like to call, ""crisis"" situations (instances where you end up in a terrible spot and thinking/reacting fast is your only means of survival"".Jumping- FINALLY, A GAME WHERE I CAN PLAY AN RPG, FIGHT IN REAL TIME, AND JUMP!!!! Moving in 3 dimensions makes platforming puzzles and combat reach another level of challenging.Puzzles- Puzzles are NEVER stupidly difficult and one particular puzzle can actually be solved without getting a ""mandatory"" upgrade nearby as 2 of the 3 characters. Puzzles are more meant to keep you from ""completely"" blitzing through the game.Story- Story is spaced out enough that it will never wholely interrupt your climb through the tower, but will still be there to keep you interestedBoss Fights- Probably the crowning achievement of Ys games, the boss fights will almost ALWAYS let you have a ton of fun on any difficulty (Yes, even people like me who are frustrated on higher difficulties still enjoy Nightmare mode/Inferno mode for Oath in Felghana). The fact that most of them keep the same pace, or even speed up a bit near the end of the fight, keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes victories that much sweeter.Difficulty select- You can't change once you start...but at the beginning there are multiple difficulties for the casual/hardcore masochist in all of us. Very Easy mode for the people who just want to beat the game, all the way up to Nightmare for the people who want to be challenged/punished for slightly better unlockable rewards.Music- FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING SACRED AND DEMONIC IN ALL WORLDS, THIS MUSIC IS AMAZING :L I am a SLAVE to the soundtracks in Ys games! Fanboying aside....we DO have many memorable tracks and a few that may put you to sleep (I'm looking at you 2nd sector >.<) but the tracks are all VERY good standalone....just not always for extended periods of time. The BGM will be the same for the ENTIRE time you are in a sector/until you enter a boss area, so get used to them.Cons- Combat playstyles- Each character can only really play one way...turning trash mob combat into tedium when you are a few levels shy of doing any real damage to enemies. Trash mobs WILL eventually turn into beat-em up sections if you need to go level grinding for any reason.Level to Damage scaling- You will get new armor and be able to upgrade your weapon as you play through the game but at the same time your level is just as dependant on your damage. If you are even 2 levels shy of where you ""should be"" you will do little to no damage. You will literally get a small damage/defense spike around certain levels just so you keep up, a pattern present in Ys: Oath in Felghana as well. The same applies to having a weapon too low level. I was at the 3rd boss of the game as the 1st playable character and I noticed I could barely do 2 damage to the guy. Turns out, I missed an upgrade partway through the tower section I was in; because the MOMENT I got it the boss was taking normalized damage again. Upgrade (as a result) are NOT optional, which may kill the game for you if you are playing on Hard/Nightmare and you are going in blind. Glitches- The game is relatively glitch-free from my 160-170 hours on record, but occasionally you will witness things like falling through a floor during an attack or clipping into things that stay relatively solid. Nothing too bad, but it did hurt a little getting to the true final boss and falling through the floor RIGHT as I pulled out my nuke move.Upgrades- Remember how I said upgrades ""should"" be optional in places? This is where the game has the potential to be a real deal breaker for some. Most RPGs have proven that treasure chests are relatively optional unless something you NEED is in them. Ys: Origin loves planting things that make not getting OHKO'd/combat even remotely possible late game IN treasure chests and then giving you free reign to ignore them. This is not a complaint, but this HAS halted/slowed the progress of a few people Ive helped out on the forums. You should ALWAYS go for chests you see...even if it looks like a pain in the butt to get if you want to have a decent time above Easy mode.Overall, I give this an 8/10, its EASILY one of my favorite games (especially out of my Steam Library) but even I can see where this game would♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off.

												If you're in to (japanese) Action-RPG's and like a great challenge when it comes to boss fights, I highly recommend Ys: Origin. There are 3 different playable characters with their own playstyles and multiple difficulties to choose from. The basic ""grinding"" and leveling system is fun and addictive. You'll just want to keep slaying enemies after another, before your accumulating +exp, +str and +mana regen meters run off. The levels have puzzles and ofc treasures aswell, so it's not all brainless grinding (though you still can't turn your brain off while leveling, it's easy to die to normal mobs unless you pay attention). The level designs are nice aswell, there's enough to explore and it's not linear at all.But the best part of Ys: Origin are the hard boss battles. (If you're experienced in this kind of genre, I recommend either Hard or Nightmare difficulty to make the best out of the fights) The boss tactics are quite varied, though many resembled me of Touhou games, just in 3D. In other words there's quite a lot of projectiles to avoid, and you can't take too many hits. The fights usually take some time to learn to execute good enough, but beating the boss in the end is a great feeling.The story isn't anything fancy unfortunately, so better not get your hopes up on that.

												A great game. Basically Dark Souls with graphics from the 90s. The usual enemies are not so tough but bosses require multiple attempts even on normal. Gave even up on beating the final boss. Harder than any Dark Souls 1 boss. in my opinionStill, entertaining combat, great story, awesome cutscenes and the soundtrack makes them even more awesome. Multiple characters with different abilities available. Recommended.			",25,1,0,4,1,0,13

												Ys origin is a great game,its an action-jrpg that has all the elements that makes Ys series great, the huge difficult bosses, the fast paced action, the amazing music. This one follows the style of the modern 3D Ys games like oath in felghana and ark of napishtim but the story is a prequel of the whole Ys series, before Ys I & II chronicles. It does a great job explaining how the story started with interesting characters and a plot that suits the game. Dont expect an amazing plot but its decent.As for the content, the game offers three playable characters (one fo them is unlocked after you complete the game with one of the first two) with different story for each one, also there is boss rush,time attack and an arena mode, so there is lots of things to do. Just for completion with one character you will need about 12 hours in normal difficulty.The game can be really hard so think carefully before starting it in hard mode for a first playthrough.I highly recommend this game for hack and slash action-jrpg fans.

												One word: Awesome. A perfect mix of platforming, great soundtrack, hack and slash combat, epic boss battles, good story, and best of all, replayability. The soundtrack is possibly the best of any game I've played, the boss battles are old-school style (specifcally a mixture of Devil May Cry and Legend of Zelda), and it has 3 different characters with 3 different stories, adding to the replayability value. 10/10 in my book.

												Ys Origins is a mix between Diablo and Zelda, and it is very fun to play. Unfortunately the great gameplay, soundtrack and visuals are dragged down by downright cringeworthy dialogue and a by the numbers story with a very flat ending. The graphics are also a bit dated even for 2006 when this originally came out. However the game still has a charm of its own. The character sprites are well made and environments have clear and different themes and feels. The fast pace of the monster slaying is maybe a bit too often grinded into a halt when you have to sit through lengthy and uninteresting line exchanges between the monotone and cliche characters.One interesting thing of note is the other main character of the game, Hugo. He should probably get an award for the most edgy video game protagonist ever. Most of the cringe material of the game comes from his teenage rebel attitude. The story might have been much less cringy had I picked Yunica for playable character, but I also think the edginess is kinda charming and memorable.In conclusion the rock solid gameplay and soundtrack totally redeem this game from any negatives I might have towards it. It was a blast to play and a definite recommendation.			",341,77,9,32,16,2,38

												Ys Origin is that one game I have been waiting for to make me feel like a child again. I orginally got this game because I have played some other Nihon Falcom games.      This game completely blew me away. This series is now on my top 10 list just from playing this one game. The fighting is fun and quirky and makes me wish more games took this kind of play style. On top of that the story was perfect. The writers took great detail in making sure that you fell in love with the character. Granted I have only played one character and there are two more I can play, but I completely fell for Yunica our heroine. This to me is one of the best games I have played and will always have a place in my heart.Storyline: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Characters: 9/10 Personal Score: 10/10Overall: 9.5/10(Note:I have not played all Characters. So character score is based off of Yunica who I have play.)			",112,27,0,26,15,0,14

												Amazing game, one of the best cRPG and for sure one with the best lore out there. Even on normal difficulty killing some bosses requires a lot of wipes. I ended game with 2 characters - Yunica and one that you unlock after you end game with Yunica or Hugo. Playing and beating game by Yunica is fun, there is more puzzles and exploring tower by her for first time is a real challange. Finding all hidden chests takes a lot of time. Unlocked hero doesnt have so much puzzles and you already know the tower so its easy to get through all levels, but imo bosses are far more challanging on this one and lore is incredibly good.

												First off I have never played any of the Ys games before, so this is the first time I've played one, and I have to say the game is  brilliant. The graphical style is very nice mixing nicely designed 3D enviroments with really detailed 2D character models. The gameplay is a mix between hack 'n' slash and RPG, and the game does this really well, the game also provides a good challenge and seems to be a very lengthy game, especially for those who like finish things 100%. I would highly recommend this to any hack 'n' slash or RPG fan, also, the bosses are pretty awesome too.			",457,48,5,44,7,0,18

												This game is outstanding. I wasn't sold on the demo, but I got this one on sale. So happy I decided to do that. The demo does not do it justice, not by any means.Pros- The gameplay is the best part of this game. Fast paced and challenging in a good way. You're not going to find yourself losing because of cheap tricks, it's almost always something you didn't do correctly. The boss fights are intense and unforgiving. You have to learn how to beat a boss, you won't be able to mash buttons and luck your way through it. They demand skill, and will likely take multiple tries on a reasonable difficulty level before you figure out how to counter everything a boss can throw at you.-The stories are also an amazing aspect of the game. Each character is unique and will draw you into their individual approaches toward the main plot.- The graphics are simple and beautiful, and perfect for this type of game. I love that they didn't try to make this into a movie, like the idea seems to be for far too many games today. If you want a game that's going to blow you away with the gameplay and not make you feel like you're spending 5 minutes playing and then 15 minutes watching a pretty animated movie, this is the game for you.Cons- The only con I have, and it may just be my situation, is that my mouse does not like this game at all. It seems to lag horribly, and this makes particular parts of the game a real mess. It can be very frustrating when you lose a battle not because you did anything wrong, but because you were trying to move one direction, but because of latency issues, you move another. Also, I've found that the skills (controlled by my mouse wheel) seem to switch even when I'm sure I haven't touched the mouse wheel at all. The game can be played with a keyboard, but that presents it's own challenges. This game really seems like it's perfectly suited for a controller.Overall I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one. The difficulty levels are scaled perfectly, and there's one for every type of gamer. It's one that you'll probably keep playing just to complete everything about it that you possibly can, because it's that addicting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've not got incredibly far in this game but what I've played so far has been a blast. The controls (at least with an XBOX Controller) are tight and responsive, and the combat is very fun.However, the real treat in this game is the boss fights, which are hella cool and provide a pretty good challenge. I'd recommend a controller because the response time and precision of control you need is so exact. Some of the bosses go into bullet hell territory but many of them require precision jumps and dodges to beat. The common enemies don't really give you too much trouble, but there are areas where combinations of certain types of baddy provide a pretty satisfying clear up.The graphics are what you'd expect from a small budget Japanese game. They're functional, mostly sprite characters on poly backgrounds and the art style is nice enough if not a little generic. The particle effects are very nice and the fully 3D bosses look fantastic and really show the games artistic strength in full. But you're not really playing this game for the graphics.All in all I'd recommend it to anyone, especially at a sale price!			",313,50,3,43,36,2,61

												I strongly recommend playing this game. It is an action RPG where you can play through as three characters, the final character unlocking the true story behind the game. The controls of this series have finally gotten far, far less clunky, and Ys Origin will keep you on the move. There is very little stopping, even with level grinding. Hit things, fire magic at them, kill all the demons and make it to the top of the tower, learning more and more along the way. This game also has supreme replayability, as you can (and should) play as all three characters, each with a unique storyline and playstyle. PLAY IT, BUY IT, UNDERRATED SERIES ",85,16,0,12,1,1,9

												A really fun 3D platformer RPG. The enemies and characters are almost all 2D sprites with a very interesting art style, remeniscent of Super Mario RPG, with GIANT and wonderfully difficult 3D bosses. While many ma find the RPG elements annoying, they are very good, generally if you kill most enemies you wil be a suitable level to survive well, with me only having to grind once. There are also three different characters to play as, which is pretty good and adds replay value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, any game from this franchise is pretty fun. What's also great about it is that you don't have to play the games in any particular order, which is what made this franchise popular back on the SNES. One particular complaint I have is the slowpaced intro sequences but honestly this franchise is a barebones Japanese ARPG. I'm gonna go ahead and say you owe it to yourself as a JRPG fan to play this franchise from a simpler era and how it showed you didn't need vast depth to get a great experience.

												Fun and positively addictive combat system. Grinding in this game is one of the best grinding experiences in ARPG. Boss battles are tricky and sometimes incredibly brutal, with an upward trend of difficulty in attack patterns and damage received from the first boss to the very last, which is always a crucial key in boss battles design.Storyline is straightforward and fluid with epic twists (the most literal sense of 'epic'). Covers most of the important key points that explain what happens in the main series, while also leaves very much room for personal interpretation and possibly retelling. Character designs are surprisingly intricate and interesting, considering the fact that Falcom had always been set with simplicity in all Ys titles until Ys Origin came out in 2006.Not much needs to be said about the music. Falcom JDK Band did a fantastic job as usual. I believe the music in Ys Origin is about as well-praised as that of Oath in Felghana. Beyond the Beginning is personally my favorite track.The only potential problem with the game is everything stays the very same throughout all three arcs, except for character combat mechanics, storyline, and minor spoiler: a true final boss. This can be boring to some people, but not to me personally.Overall, this is definitely a very solid and highly polished dungeon-crawler ARPG from Falcom, and a worthy title to mark the big jump of the series to Ys Seven. Absolutely a huge Yes from me.			",252,43,6,21,21,3,33

												Challenging, whimsical, emotional. Ys is an interesting series that I've stumbled upon a few years after its release. I was told that it was very ""chatty"" to which the common complaint was coupled with ""should have had voice acting."" I honestly went into this game only knowing that and nothing of the type of gameplay, combat, or the story elements I'd be facing. When I did, however, it was amazing. Ys Origin takes it's stand as a prequel to the following games before it: being Ys I, II, etc. I've never enjoyed such a vibrant set of characters before; each with their own unraveling stories AND abilities. Mastering the mechanics is some sort of joyous experience that only proves itself further when you go into boss fights. You'll be frustrated and tired of dying, but with those tight controls, well thought out music compositions, and charming graphics, you'll always come back for more.			",332,61,4,42,34,3,26

												Darn this game is amazingly addictive and makes you compel to finish the storyline.I recently got this game and decided to try it out since I have heard alot of nice things about it, and me being a fan of JRPGs certainly does help. 11 hours later, I completed the game. Well, granted I did it on the 2nd difficulty level, which is easy, it is still a fun game to play. This is one of the only few games which I powered through to the end, the others were the Assassin Creed's series up to Revealations and some others. P.S: The art style reminds me distinctively of the Golden Sun series on Gameboy, which is another highly rated game I would suggest people to play.			",312,40,12,38,27,1,34

The story is a bit la-la, but overall the fast pace and myriad of [sometimes difficult] quests/riddles to solve makes it a fun way to pass some time.The intro is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥as you can't skip it and it lasts for a long time though.

												What happens when you combine a Danmaku with a JRPG? you get Ys! This is by far one of my most favorite Action RPGs series' in existence, mainly because it's fast paced, long enough to keep my interest but short enough to give incentive for replayability, has some serious kick♥♥♥♥♥music and because it's just flat out great old school fun. Being a 90s Kid I grew up with games like this so even normal is pretty relaxing for me, but like any good game of old, the bosses are where the real challenge is at. If you've never played a Ys game then this is by far the best one to start with. Not just because it's the prequel to all Ys games,but it has great controls, fantastic looks, hectic but fair difficulty. Give it a try, you've got nothing to lose and plenty to Ys... oh and one more thing, Bring a controller with you!			",84,1,0,0,1,0,1

												I think the Ys series is really underrated, or maybe it just hasn't had the advertising it did overseas.  These games go way back and there have been several remakes of the originals, including Ys 1 and 2 that are available on Steam.  I recommend anyone that is a fan of action or RPGs to take a look at these.  If you want a more modern game then go for Oath in Felghana or Origin; Ys 1 and 2 have a much different gameplay but I still thoroughly enjoyed them.For the most rewarding experience, play them on Nightmare difficulty.

Perhaps a controller would be easier to navigate but so far the keyboard hasn't been too frustrating. -The enemies all seem to be unique and pose different challenges.-The boss battles are so far very well crafted and takes some skill... again easier with a controller.-You unlock skills as you progress similar to how you would in say metroid... which I will mention because whenever you open a chest you get the wonderful metroid new upgrade sound effect.(That's what it sounds like to me!)-Music sounds great and well done.-Storyline so far is interesting and enjoyed the usage of the Sosarian Runes, which i know from the old Ultima games.. and is similar to Dwarven Runes from Lord of the Rings. All being based off of the Germanic languages. (So far not needed to know during the game, but provided some extra interest.)-Great save point locations so you don't waste too much time from deaths.			",354,87,9,45,30,1,53

												Ys Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system. There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters. Each character has a very specific playstyle. Gameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings. In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens. The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore. They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere. At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss. The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat. ",424,68,5,71,85,2,150

The bosses are unforgiving, expecially if you pick the melee character to start with. And I like Dark Souls, I just hate the awful port that is on Steam. Go play it on a Playstation.

												An expansion pack sequel to Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin has much of the same feel of it's predecessor. New enemies and world to explore, but you handle exactly like Adol Christin, wind-powered spinny attack and all. Origin has three campaigns to justify that extra five dollars on the price tag, but they're all the same, with the exception of bosses. With the same puzzles and monsters, I finished Yunica's campaign but only scratched the surface of the other two, dropping them once I felt like I was going through the motions.What bothers me about the Ys series is that I don't think Falcom understand why their game is good. Every single one of their games starts with at least five minutes of cutscenes, with Oath in Felghana clocking in at 15 before you start to slay monsters. Game, I don't need you to tell me to beat up monsters. Legend of Zelda had an old man in a cave saying ""take this sword and♥♥♥♥♥♥off"" and I still saved the world without knowing why or caring. Damningly, around halfway through Yunica's campaign, you get thrown into a supposed-to-lose boss battle, and then your character mopes around for another five minutes of cutscene until your male love interest (no homo) cheers you up and encourages you to keep going. All the while I'm thinking about how much fun I'd be having if I was playing the game. This game needs less talky talky, more stabby stabby.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			",369,77,6,41,18,2,46

												Okay, let's just get the obvious out of the way right now: The intro to this game is LONG. LOOOOONG. Like, possibly the longest intro to an RPG I've ever played.HOWEVER, once you get past the intro, you're introduced to the meat of the gameplay, and holy hell is it satisfying! The combat in Ys: Origin is fast placed hack n slash that seems mindless at first, but if you just mindlessly spam attacks with no thought, you will die. A lot.In fact, even if you're careful, you will most likely die a lot, because this game is HARD. The normal enemies are usually no trouble, though there are indeed cases where they can chump you if you're not careful, but the real meat of the difficulty lies in the boss battles.If you're at all familiar with the Ys series, than you probably know that one of the series' most lauded aspects is the incredibly designed, incredibly difficult boss fights, and Origin is no exception. You will most likely die to a boss at least once before you learn how to deal with them. And each boss as their own styles, attacks, and strategies, so each boss feels fresh and exciting.Also, did I mention the music? Because HOLY HELL the music is amazing. Quite possibly one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.All in all, if you're looking for an RPG with fast paced action, an interesting story, amazing bosses, amazing soundtrack, and a difficulty level that constantly keeps you on your toes, then Ys Origin is for you. In fact, give the whole Ys series a try. Its a great series, and Falcom and XSeed are great companies that deserve your support.			",840,211,8,151,34,3,42

												""Let me tell you a story of the beginning.....Of Ys""Set 700 years before the events of Ys 1 and 2 we venture to the destroyed world of Ys by an unknown force of demons.Days pass as the remaining survivers atop a floting island that they sent to escape the scorge of demons on the earth known as ""Solomun Shrine"" the 2 Goddesses that watch over the people of Ys Reah and Feena have disappeard along with the source of magic in the world of Ys ""The Black Pearl""A group is dispatched to search for the godesses on the earth but are soon separated by an unknown force that attacked them on the way down from a tower that showed up out of nowhere.Shortly after regrouping the search party begins to climb the mysterious tower in search of their godesses only to find much more afoot the tower that awaits them.Unlike most Ys games where you plays as the title character ""Adol the red"" Ys origin gives us 3 different characters all together to play as.Yunica Tova: A young girl and Dauther of the Captain in Gaurd command that protect the godesses, She wields a small battle axe and is a ""less mobile"" Adol if you are familier with the other games.Hugo Fact: A mage in search of his missing brother and seeks to achieve great power, He wields ""The Eyes of Fact"" making Hugo the first Mage character to be playable in an Ys game as unlike Adol or anyone else he uses projectiles to fight from long range.Toal Fact: Hugo's older brother and was once a commander of the Gaurd for protecting the goddesses, Now a half-demon Toal's Action's seem questionable at first as he as sided with the enemy to achieve great power as well...or does he? (Unlockable only after beating the game once as Yunica or Hugo, Note: His story is the actual cannon to the series)Ys origin uses the same Ys engine that began with Ys VI and later improved in ""Oath in Felghana"" and as its own game and prequel story it holds quite well. Areas are broken to floors as you are climbing up the tower but variety exists as each floor as its own theme (Water, Sand, Fire ect) and its not just going up stairs upwards as they spice of the areas giving you places to explore for goodies and what not. However despite the variety in areas unlike other games in the series Origin is very linear in where you can and can't go to with only a very small bits of Exploring later down the line. There's also not that many Intresting characters to meet as most of them are either from the search party or the Villains of the game limiting the feel of a living world like previous games.Despite those small down parts Ys origin is still fun and challenging game like all other Ys games in the series.One small problem that kind of annoyed me is the Checkpoint systume. unlike the two eariler Ys games using this engine (Ys 6 and Oath in Felghana) if you die in an area/room you will restart from the start of that room and you can go back to a previous area if you are low on HP however Ys origin doesn't do that and instend your only means of checkpoints our the Goddess Statues that let you save the game/buy upgrades.Which means if you died a along ways through an area without getting to the next Statue its all the way back to the previous one, And while you can Teleport back to one at any point to save any progress you made (I.E points or Key story items) you still have to go all the way back to the last point you got to which on later Difficulties can get on your nerves sometimes.But if you've played any Ys game before and tried to beat it on Nightmare mode you should be pretty used to the pain and suffering by now. :P			",76,6,2,4,2,3,0

												one of the best games ive ever played... even if the beginning can be quit boringEdit:this game is one of the best Ys games in the series.Years of developing the Ys remakes have led to an very nice gameplay experience in story and mechanics. Fighting is easy to learn but can still be mastered over time.The story is a prequel to the whole Ys-series, but you don't have to play all games to enjoy it.You can play different characters which varies the story and can even lead to an different ending.Music is amazing as an any Ys game, an endless  guitar solo of epicness XD.Only con is the veeeery boring intro scene which made me almost quit before playing... Recommend to play it to the first boss before quitting ^^			",329,58,3,38,21,0,29

												I got this game on Humble Bundle for $6. I was skeptical whether or not it was worth the asking price of $20.  After playing through the game with the first character, I can say $20 is a fair price for what it gives. The game isn't an ""RPG"" in the traditional sense that people are used to (i.e. Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest). There isn't much grinding (unless you want achievements) in this and it isn't slow turn based combat where you repeat a set of tactics. Combat is quick, fluid, and fun. Bosses are hard if your difficulty is on hard or above. I died quite a few times to each boss on hard.Cutscenes aren't so long as to detract from the experience as some people have mentioned in negative reviews.Cons: Now my primary complaint is that the initial control system is attacking with the keyboard and moving with the mouse. I would recommend inverting this to attacking with the mouse and using the keyboard to move. I.e. the traditional layout for PC games. I cannot understand why this wasn't the default, but it was a simple change in the configuration.  ",189,27,4,21,19,1,41

												An incredible action RPG with 3 campains and a hard-rock soundtrack.  Each character has their own story that unfolds at a very pleasing rate, but these characters also go to the same places and almost do the same things.  As far as Ys games go this one is definitely one of the best.  One warning though, it is not the best Ys game to start on if you care about the story.  Gamplay wise this game is less like Ys Seven and more like Ys: The Oath in Felghana (Also on steam).  You have three crystals that you will obtain over time and you can upgrade them to do more stuff and get stronger.  This game also has an upgrade system for your armor, weapons, and resistances.  Music wise the Ys games are second to none, a blaring hard rock soundtrack (Plus remixes from Ys 1 & 2).  On a final note, if you like action RPGs or fantasy games this game here is a must buy.

												This game serves as my introduction to the world of Y's (pronounced EES). I've been wanting to play a game in this series for a while and I'm so happy I picked this one up. A Diablo-style action RPG, this game is hella fun. I'm several hours into my first playthrough and have really enjoyed it so far. Challenging boss fights, decent level design that rewards you for exploring while providing a decent story. It's all a very solid and polished experience that's worth your time. A lot of games like this have mecahnics that suffer or that are a bit loose. To me, this is a crucial part of enjoying a game's platforming sections. It's very frustrating when you feel like you told your character to jump from the platform they're on to the one on the right only to find that you were pressing every so slightly in an upwards/downwards direction which caused you to miss the platform and fall into the pit. Not so here. I felt like I had good control over the character and rarely if ever made such a mistake that felt all too common even in AAA titles that are top ranked in their class. Overall I really can't find much to fault in this game. To nitpick I'd say the costumes are a bit plain when you're talking to others but this is also refreshing at the same time. It's simple, and practical. I would also say there maybe could have been more variety with the monsters but this doesn't really bother me at all either. It's just a fun game that's knows what it is and has fun being just that. If you like games like this I highly recommend giving it a try.			",81,11,0,18,7,0,13

												It's a satisfying hack and slash game, but keep in mind, this is not a title for the intellectual gamer. I'll start by explaining what I don't like before what I do like. (IMPORTANT - This game is not worth $19.99. Get it when it goes on sale.)The writing is horrible and the game treats you like a baby that can't figure anything out on your own. For example, I entered a zone on the 12th floor that would quickly drain my HP simply by being there, forcing me to leave the area. When the character said that it felt like an evil sound boring into her head, I checked my inventory and saw the silver harmonica given to me by one of the goddesses. I figured ""No brainer right? I just got this thing, so obviously this is the solution."" I go back into the zone and try using the harmonica, but it doesn't work. And not in the context that the character tried using it, but failed. I mean I went to use the item and got the equivalent of Prof. Oak saying ""Now is not the time to use that."" No, you have to call somebody outside of the room, listen to a conversation, and have the character say bluntly that ""Hey, look at this here harmonica. I'll betcha that will solve the problem."" So now, I don't feel like somebody who used reasoning to deduce the solution to a problem. I feel like my hand is being held. (And yes, I know that the harmonica still doesn't technically work even after the conversation, but it still serves the purpose of progressing the game.)And again, the writing is fanfiction levels of god awful. Maybe if the writing were better and didn't look like it was tailored to pre-teens, the story could possibly be decent. But with writing like this, there's no way any adult could enjoy it. ---As for the good things about the game, despite not being the deepest combat system, it's very fast paced and feels extremely satisfying. I've played the game for about 6 hours now and I'm still not tired of the button mashy combat. Enemies spit out tons of resources after being defeated, giving that packrat portion of our minds a constant tickle. My favorite part of the game would have to be the boss fights. Unlike other aspects that treat you like a child, these boss fights are pretty brutal. I'm playing the game on hard mode, and I've had to go through these fights at least 10 or so times before coming away victorious. I love that there's actually room to strategize in these fights. Like a giant centipede that drops poison time bombs from its destroyed body parts. Do you try your best to methodically clear out the bombs, or do you continue assaulting the boss and hope to outlast them? And while you do have the opportunity to go back and grind out some levels to make it easier, these bosses will still command all of your attention.  Overall, I don't believe the game is worth the asking price of $19.99. If the writing were better and if the zones actually had secrets and left more room for exploration, then it would be a no brainer. As it stands, Ys Origin is a fairly straightforward hack and slash that is very good when you're actually playing the game, but suffers when anybody opens their mouth. Again, get it on sale for sure. Around $4.99 is more than acceptable.   ",447,98,4,41,23,3,45

												Ys Origins is a old school JRPG time of game. part of the Ys franchise it is actually a prequel to the other games. Its action packed, the boss fights are hard and has a reasonable good soundtrack being very good at times. I'll add that the story, while being a bit thin, does start to grow on you speacially after you unlock the third playable character and start to play with him.There is also plenty to do and a good replayability value given all the unlocks the game have like arena modes and as I said 3 playable character in the campaign. I recomend it for fans of this type of games as well as someone who enjoys a chalenge.			",119,23,1,10,3,0,10

												Action-packed, a fine story, lots of great boss battles (AMAZING boss battles!)… this is a hacky-slashy JRPG that has it all. The game might look kind of old, but it’s still pretty and plenty of fun. If you’ve played OiF, then the gameplay will feel quite familiar. There are three (one of them must be unlocked) main characters, each with their own style of fighting. The story takes place before the events of Ys I and II, which fans suggest you play before starting this one. Don’t let that stop you from picking this one up whenever you can though! Show your support! Falcom and XSEED are a match made in heaven. I really hope they continue to bring over games to this side of the pond for a long time to come. Overall, Ys Origin has to be one of the best games I’ve bought on Steam, and I’m really happy to have it in my library.			",267,92,12,41,14,3,38

												The Ys series is a long runnning action RPG series from way back in the 1980s. In 2006 a prequel to the first two games in the series was made called ""Ys Origin"" it  allowed you to play as three different characters with three different playstyles and abilities. You got to move around a strategize how you were going to attack your foes with melee or magic spells in nicely done varied areas such as a water and fire sections. The game has some platforming and slight puzzle sections at times too which is a nice change of pace. Falcom here again did a nice OST to listen too while your killing those bosses or even when jumping from area to area or running down hallways killing everything in sight. The story as already mentioned is a prequel telling more of the story established in earlier Ys games and connecting them. It's nice and each character you play as has their own little portion in the plot I really like games that do that. If you are craving some action based JRPGs check out this game for sure you won't regret it! :)			",2924,1193,114,320,386,35,449

												One of the best action/rpg i have ever played. This is what dark soul inspired itself from, to make their bosses. Ys does not relent, the action is fast and rarely stopping. The music is great and gets you going for hour. the difficulty is present and will challenge you, this particular game is a little more easy than Oath, nothing that putting it on Nightmare cannot fix. The game plays like a rpg in the way of magic, equipment and character development, but everything else play like an action rpg, perharps a bit like zelda too, if he could turn super sayan! This particular one challenge you with multiple playable characters each with their touch and varying stories.-Lost			",436,97,0,111,17,1,61

												Ys Origin plays like a top-down hack-and-slash but can at times be so frantic it feels like a bullet hell. Think Zelda on steroids. An interesting story, awesome gameplay, and very challenging. Well worth the money and made me purchase the other Ys games - which I am also enjoying.You are given the choice of playing as a girl with a big axe or a guy with magic. After you beat the game you can go ahead and replay it with the other character or with a new, 3rd character. Playing it with the girl or guy you're first given feels generally the same, although you obviously have an entirely different set of skills. All three characters pretty much trek through the exact same dungeon layout but the 3rd character you unlock fights a set of new bosses and has an entirely different story. Playing on higher difficulties actually changes things besides HP and damage - although the story stays the same.One downside is that I feel that the leveling was pretty tedius. You will find yourself in positions where you need to grind out 5 levels because it is literally impossible to beat a boss if you don't have the damage output. This only takes maybe 10-15 minutes before each boss but later in the game I remember having to spend an entire hour just beating up 1,000 grunts.Defintely one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while.

												The Ys series is one of the longest running franchises around. As far as RPGs go, there isn't really another series to compare with this. Ys Book I & II was one of (if not the 1st) action RPGs. And even today, there aren't many other games that do it better. Even though Ys Origin was released many years after I & II, Origin stays true to what make an Ys game, an Ys game. You can always expect brutal boss battles, a compelling story, an absolutely amazing soundtack, enjoyable characters, beautiful visuals, & unforgiving gameplay.I fell in love with this series back in the late 80's on my TGCD. I just about crapped my pants when I heard Ark of Napishtim was being released on PS2 & made it an immediate purchase. Now years later finding a treasure trove of Ys games on Steam... how am I supposed to resist?The Ys series may not get the recognition of the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest franchises(at least not in the US), but it ought to. Being the 1st game in the Ys series(timeline wise), Origin is a great way to be introduced to one of the best RPGs around. I highly recommend it.			",820,186,6,73,31,7,49

												Ys Origin is one of the best games I've ever played.It has the perfect balance between story, music and gameplay.  The combat is simple to learn but hard to master if you want to tackle higher difficulties or venture into Arena or Time Attack mode.  You'll probably want to use a controller.  The story in this game is simply one of the most perfectly paced and emotionally driven games I've had the pleasure of playing.  This game completely blows every other Ys game out of the water (Take that, Adol!).  If you're a Ys fan, or any sort of JRPG fan, or even an anime fan, this game was made for you.With every track of music that is perfectly tuned for each area to match the locale, to the incredibly deep characters that have their own personal motivations and feelings, this game will blow your socks off and keep you guessing about some of the characters until the very end.  This is what game design should be about.  Graphics don't matter, they don't have to cost millions of dollars, they just need a little bit of love.Praise the Goddesses.			",105,7,0,13,4,0,7

												i gotta say... who the frick hands you a reraise item as they themselve is on deaths door?!.. ok the game has a story an its kinda dumb, some ppl wanna like bring down a floating island or something an things are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the planet cuz monsters an junk theirs this orb pearl thing thats important or w/e... main point is i didnt listen really to the story all that much mainly cuz it didnt really care. that being said... this game is by far one of the best times i've had with an action rpg ever hands down its a 9/10 in my eyes due 100% to its battle system an attention to detail. the passive items you get are really neat too since they come into play without the game spelling it out for you, the game makes you think ""hey maybe if i used this item that thing would *blank*"" its really nice to have a feeling that i figuered it out an i wasnt told i needed to use an item. all in all if you like grinding that feels rewarding, a battle system that is fair an action packed, really cheesy bad yet loveable wrighting then this game is for you. i had tons of fun with this game an now totally a fan an will be getting some of the other Y's titles... but i gotta say it... F*CK YOU ROY.			",47,4,0,9,5,0,1

												This one is for those thirsty for quality JRPG action! A very well designed game both in graphics and sound. Not the most thrilling of plots but very well written, nevertheless. Enough to keep you engaged for some playthroughs. Superb gameplay, with hack 'n slash elements and innovative spellcasting. A good variety of enemies in general and bosses only increase this game's worth, and they'll surely make you stay on your toes more than you think you would!I think it could be way better if the stories of the three playable characters were intertwined. At some points, there are events in which it would be more satisfying if another character was focused instead of the one you're playing with.Because of all that, I'd give Ys Origin a 9/10. :D			",164,19,5,32,20,1,13

												Really fun JRPG platformer. Enemies are pretty easy and bring in the fun of reigning destruction, and just as you get bored of it, they bring in a very difficult bossfight that you won't beat on the first try on normal or higher. Controls can be awkward, so it might be better on a controller. Also the music rocks too.			",158,13,0,34,10,0,18

												Ys Origin is a good game. It's worth every bit of money I spent on it. But it's not perfect. There are some flaws with the game that prevents the game from being great.1) The story-If you've already played Ys back in the golden age of the Super Famicom, you'll probably appreciate the story in this prequel. But if you never played them, chances are you'll be disappointed with the story. It's very cliche and predictable. Even worse is the story for each characters. Long story short, each of them aren't parallel with each other.2) The difficulty-Hard games are good and welcomed but the difficulty in Ys Origin is borderline cheap and unfair. Basically, the higher difficulty means enemies have more health, takes less damage and deals more damage to you. It pretty much boils down to grinding enough levels by killing the same enemies over and over again, just to inflict damage more than 1 to the enemy. That, and finding power-up item to strengthen your weapon because if not, the later stages becomes nearly impossible. Unless you're a masochist or have a lot of free time, just play it on normal or easy.3) The gameplay-It's fun enough for a few hours, especially after getting all abilities but it get pretty old as you play. Equipment, stats, abilities, items, etc are all streamlined and simplified. You'll be begging for more complexity the more you play. Almost no exploration or secret locations to discover, a few unneeded platforming and a non-existent puzzles to solve.  I'm giving this a thumbs up simply because it succeeded in giving me a brief moment of enjoyment.RECOMMENDED        : For Ys fans. If not, buy this during a sale.NOT RECOMMENDED: Player who seeks more complexity than slash-fest J Action RPG			",40,21,0,26,4,0,2

												Ys Origin is a good game. It's worth every bit of money I spent on it. But it's not perfect. There are some flaws with the game that prevents the game from being great.1) The story-If you've already played Ys back in the golden age of the Super Famicom, you'll probably appreciate the story in this prequel. But if you never played them, chances are you'll be disappointed with the story. It's very cliche and predictable. Even worse is the story for each characters. Long story short, each of them aren't parallel with each other.2) The difficulty-Hard games are good and welcomed but the difficulty in Ys Origin is borderline cheap and unfair. Basically, the higher difficulty means enemies have more health, takes less damage and deals more damage to you. It pretty much boils down to grinding enough levels by killing the same enemies over and over again, just to inflict damage more than 1 to the enemy. That, and finding power-up item to strengthen your weapon because if not, the later stages becomes nearly impossible. Unless you're a masochist or have a lot of free time, just play it on normal or easy.3) The gameplay-It's fun enough for a few hours, especially after getting all abilities but it get pretty old as you play. Equipment, stats, abilities, items, etc are all streamlined and simplified. You'll be begging for more complexity the more you play. Almost no exploration or secret locations to discover, a few unneeded platforming and a non-existent puzzles to solve.  I'm giving this a thumbs up simply because it succeeded in giving me a brief moment of enjoyment.RECOMMENDED        : For Ys fans. If not, buy this during a sale.NOT RECOMMENDED: Player who seeks more complexity than slash-fest J Action RPG			",40,21,0,26,4,0,2

												Ys is a fantastic series of action RPGs.  The 16bit graphics are great and really evoke a retro feel.  If you grew up on the Ys games, the nostalgia factor alone makes this worth playing.  If you didn't, you can rely on the smooth controls and great gameplay to satsify you.If you like action RPGs and appreciate retro graphcis you can't go wrong with this game or Oath in Felgana.

												If you''re looking for a fun and addicting action rpg look no further. Ys Origin and a light hearthed but still serious story, an amazing soundtrack and offers great replayability with 3 playable characters (one you have to unlock). Each character has their own story and offers different conversation while playing through the game which keeps things interesting. It''s not a long game but with the three characters you''ll easily get 30+ hours out of the game not counting time attack and bosh rush modes. If you''re looking for a jrpg which is actually good and not boring don''t look any further you''ve found it.			",564,222,18,114,74,3,72

												This is one of those few games that are actually worth the full price. It's an awesome platform action arcade game, with a tiny bit of roleplaying elements. I'm no anime fan, but I liked the characters, the story and the design, music and the whole package. Tip though, if you're like me and use mouse and keyboard, remember to configure it before you start playing.The game also has a very good difficulty settings, and due to the 3 characters you can play, a good replay value.

												Decent game, not a very worthy addition to the Ys Series as a whole though... The back story on Ys was something I never cared about and this game didn't really do a good attempt at making me care now... so yeeeeeah. I'd reccommend it to both casual and masochistic gamers just for the solid gameplay alone.The difficulty is quite insane and requires hours of training if you intend to complete it on Nightmare mode. Unfortunately completing the game on the hardest setting is the only way to get the full experience and unlock all the extra goodies like alternate costumes / characters and most of the achievements.It's quite tedious if you intend to experience the entire story as there are three playable characters and the final and true story arc doesn't unlock until you complete the game with the first two characters... not to mention if you're one of those loliconners you unlock a school girl outfit for the main by completing the game an additional THREE times after the initial three playthroughs... it's kind of unreal... I mean just go download some porn, it's faster and healthier.I'd stick to easy mode and experience the paltry story just to say you've ""Been there and done that"" if you're a casual Ys fan... Easy = Fun, Nightmare = NONE. Keep that credo in mind if you decide to purchase it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think it was worth playing it two time through. didnt like Hugo's combat style(that why i didnt play his story :P) but thats an personal opinion and maybe because i like Yunica raw bruteforce and not range combat in that game.if you maybe want to buy a new game and don't know which give this on a try!HF ^~^ ",310,33,1,29,24,0,35

												Many have dismissed Ys Origin as a cheap cash in game, a place holder between other, more successful games. Yet I'm not one of those; sure, it's basically Ys I&II: The Before Years, but that's EXACTLY why I enjoy the game. Ys as a series has been sorely lacking in back story; many key events in the past have been teased by Falcom, yet we've never seen them. Ys Origin, thankfully, does the job of offering us SOME insight to the history of the flying island, several bosses/main villains of Ys I&II and, finally, the reason why the Goddesses of Ys lost their wings.Even though Oath of Felghana and even Ark of Napishtim are better in certain aspects, Origin IS NOT in any way truly inferior to them. It has the same great engine and game play of the others, and despite, or perhaps maybe in spite of the fact that it's all contained within Darm Tower, Ys Origin earns its place in my heart for giving me precious back story that's been so scarce.Oh, and Adol is unlockable. JOY!			",393,75,0,112,21,2,65

												This is one of the best games that I've played in a long time. The story has emotional depth and replayability is high. Definitely a must-have. Although playable with a mouse and keyboard, a controller is highly recommended for the best play experience. Fast paced combat and tough bosses make for a very satisfying game. Make sure to beat the game with one of the initial characters in order to unlock the best charcter with the ending that is considered canon to the story!			",626,144,11,77,39,3,76

												This is a game I really want to like, but it's just too flawed. The bosses I played were very creative and possibly some of the best I've seen in a game of this genre. So why don't I recommend it? First off, unskippable, long, unnecessary intro. Supposedly you can skip it if you've beaten the game - still not acceptable. The next major beef is the bizarre leveling system. One character level can mean the difference between unbeatable boss and wow, that boss was easy peasy. Finally, the boss and area that made me pretty much quit early was the Construct. Cool boss design, but I'd like to damage him successfully. The fight is pretty much you play for like 2-3 minutes to be able to take off a tenth of his health bar. It's an easy fight, but the patterns are so predictable that it just feels like a massive waste of time. The next area, I don't know what happened. Maybe I shouldn't have been able to beat that boss, but the standard enemies just became massive damage sponges. Went from dealing like 40-60 damage per hit to 2-7. Just completely unfun. It could have been a great game, but balance issues run amok it seems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ys isn't as bad as the first few hours make it seem.  There's enough about it that's bad enough to give it a thumbs down, but it's definitely done some things pretty well.  This review lists major points concisely with more detailed explanations at the bottom.Here are the flaws I've seen so far:-Character and item upgrade systems are pathetically bad.-Uninspired levels.-The 'puzzles' involve finding an item and backtracking to use it.  -Framerate issues with some graphical effects.-Controls need autofire and autocharge.  Other control problems may be specific to me.-Too many rpg text dialogs that can't be skipped.  -The difficulty curve isn't right.  -The rate of levelling needs adjusting, and the effect of gaining levels is not done well.  It increases damage done and decreases damage taken, altering boss fight difficulty too much.Game's strong points:+The bosses are very challenging with fully-avoidable attacks+The action is fast-paced.  +The graphics are colorful, and I like the graphical style of the characters.Regarding difficulty,On Hard difficulty with the magic user, the monsters are a joke, unable to threaten the player.  The bosses are very challenging.  On nightmare difficulty with the melee character, the (skippable) trash monsters are about right, but the bosses are extremely challenging.  There is at least 1 boss fight that cannot be won without grinding due to its being a dps race.  It is not obvious that grinding is the intended (and only) way to win the encounter.  Grinding 5 levels for that fight also reduced the boss's attacks from 40 dmg/hit to 9 dmg/hit.  I do not know how hard those bosses are supposed to hit, and I suspect the developers don't either.  Without grinding, nightmare bosses can take 1-10 hours to beat, including the time to learn their moves.Unskippable dialogsare ubiquitous and boring.  Even if I were interested in reading the story of a hero who rescues princesses and saves the world, my replays through the game would not be.The intro cinematic is well done, but it can't be skipped either.  It takes at least 15 minutes to start a new game due to the unskippable cut scenes and dialog.The controlsdesperately need an autofire button and a way to hold down the magic charge button.  Using outside configuration utilities creates some problems in the game such as menus opening and closing due to autofire.  Holding down the magic charge button while imtermittently holding down the attack button and periodically jumping has led to some hand soreness.  Without autofire, the repetitive button presses will cause a lot of repetitive stress.Even after some configuration, there are still occaisional phantom axis motions, and recharging magic immediately after casting makes it cast twice.

												I will be reviewing this game in stages as I play it.My expectations are, from reading reviews, a game with a good story.So I chose my character, and pressed start. Actually getting to gameplay took almost 11 minutes of unskippable-cutscenes and dialouge (with me jamming through skippable dialouge). One of my biggest criteria for a game is how long it takes me to be able to PLAY the game. This can be mitigated by interesting presentation. Ys Origin does not have interesting presentation.7 minutes til you can start pressing a button. 7 minutes to get past ""So there was a paradise named Ys. Then demons showed up. Twin goddesses lifted their city into the sky. Demons made a tower to get at them. Then the goddesses left. You're a member of the team to track them down in the tower."" Then you spend 4 more minutes scrolling through ""Where am I? I better go to the tower"". Finally, after ANOTHER cutscene showcasing the Barad-Dur rip-off, you get to the tower and start fighting the monsters. But this is broken up by lots of clumsy tutorializing. Skip ahead a few more minutes and you get actual control. So if you want to start a new game, expect close to 20 minutes before you get to play the game. Great. Excellent pacing. I'm sure there's other games out there that aren't there to pad their length out artificially.So far other reviewers have let me down. This isn't an interesting story, this is a PREMISE. The characters are anime archetypes. One is an apprentice fighter girl (despite the long♥♥♥♥♥intro saying they're sending their ELITES) and an brusque, impatient mage. The gameplay feels like a solid PS1 era dungeon crawler. Feels a bit primitive but functional. The pacing is utterly awful. If you have lots of time on your hands, you might like this.More to come as I play a little more.			",152,28,1,16,8,0,16

												The mouse cursor is way too fast and it doesn't let you adjust it in-game. I don't want to have to adjust cursor speed everytime I play the game or use a third party program. I'm using dual monitors and if the mouse accidentally reaches into the other monitor and I click down on it it'll switch windows so I'll lose health to enemies while I'm trying to tab back into the game. There's no way to make the game full screen so that doesn't happen and I don't want to have to disable my second monitor just to play this game. I only played it for about 6-7 minutes and was too frustrated with lack of options to control these problems. Also, there's like a 15 minute intro that you can't skip. No thanks. If I could use a controller instead then the game would probably run a lot smoother.			",154,35,1,36,7,0,35

												This game had potential. I have played the others in this series. However Steam is selling a broken version. As to how they managed to crash a duel GTX titan I7 rig is beyond me. After looking through the files a bit (not an expert) I found nothing unusual. How ever when I launch the game the FPS jumps to 1000 or so (not possible?) then into negatives and then the screen turns all funky colors and freezes. My usual Insticnt is to remove cartridge and blow into it, but as you know thats not possible here. Im very dissapointed with steam support for not allowing a refund even though i have than 32 seconds gameplay and I purchased it 3 hours ago. I am warning you all now. DO NOT waste your money.

												After forcing you to watch a 30-minute intro, it still doesn't let you play for about the first 10 minutes.  Then you are placed in a dungeon which is unreasonably complicated.  I really like the concept of this game, but don't have the time or interest to do various parts over and over, especially when you have to walk 2 minutes back to try again.  Maybe I'm missing something, but that's not fun.			",227,35,3,31,12,2,11

Because all the no-lifers out there are mimimimi but then everybody gets the Clear the Game on XY Difficulty ... so ♥♥♥♥ing what?Better than start this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t over again and lose hours of progress.Final Verdict, i don´t recommend this game because at the end it just pisses you off and the last impression when you alt +f4 a game after you had enough of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and don´t want to finish it anymore is just as important as the first impression.

												On the pluss side:+ This game had a smooth and nice gameplay and from time to time I really did enjoy it.On the other hand the negative list is far to long for me to give it a thumbs up. The negative is:- The controlls when using a controller was incorrect since it displayed the keys for the keyboard- I thought no game could beat Half-life intro in boringness and length, I was wrong.- Because of the boring intro, I lost intrest in the story and all the story elements was just lost on me.- The grafics was kind of bad, both in the cutscenes and in the game. The fact that I am stuck with the resolution 800*600 makes matters even worse.So if you play with a keyboard, like stories that takes ages to even let you play and like this retro style with mixed 2d and 3d modells, this might be the game for you. This is not the case for me so I am going to uninstall in about 2 seconds.			",489,143,17,61,48,5,110

												I am really amused how much good reviews this game got on steam. Most likely game is overrated because of nostalgia.pros:- Great platformer- Story- Soundtrack (for those who like such music)cons: - not an RPG at all (by modern standarts)- unskippable video: long and predictable hence boring- uninspired level design, too repetitive- Spam attack button to win on hard difficulty.- Spam attack button to win on nightmare difficulty.*** for those who are going to argue about difficulty, yes, bosses may be tough, everything else - just spam attack button.gameply:1. Watch unskippable anime (or just minimize the game and do something fun)2. Spam action button to skip tons of text (or read it if you haven't played any RPG video games in your life)3. move your character for a few seconds4. spam action button to skip text (or read it)5. spam action button to defeat your enemies6. spam action button to skip text7. move your character and spam attack (which is the same as ""action"") button8. repeatconclusion:It is very easy to like this game: Solution #1you need a few things:- love anime in general- remember original game - have nostalgiaSolution #2You haven't played any RPG games before, or played only jRPG games.Solution #3You just like easy-going pace of this ... well ... combination of non-interactive story and attack button simulator.

												I'm told this game is good.. But I just don't have the patience to get past the first hour of the game. It's filled with unskippable cutscenes, some of which aren't really necessary, and an unbelievably slow to start story. I can just see that this game will end up being 90% cutscenes and dialoge instead of combat.. So it doesn't really reflect what the trailers and screenshots show. I got this in a humlbe bundle and..

												If you're looking for a game that you just can go to play... forget this. Now. First hour is watching quite boring animations and story and it's really slow paced. Nothing like the trailers. On the other hand if you're looking an adventure game with over 9000 thousands of animation and around 16 minutes of gameplay, yay.After more hours. I keep it in there. Gameplay is good. Bosses are interesting and some fairly hard. But there's too much stopping ""story cutscenes"" that you can't even skip.  Those are a no go in modern gaming (or in any gaming in my opinion).Playing this to unlock all the achievements is painful.			",292,49,7,24,22,3,40

												Ys Origin (and the Ys series for that matter) is an odd combination of RPG/Platform/Puzzler but that doesn't stop it from being a surprisingly enjoyable game.The RPG elements are light, with upgradable equipment, attack choices and bonuses to pick up from defeated monsters in a arcade style way of handling temporary buffs. Story-line wise, there's nothing ground breaking here with some 'world is ending, must save it' fayre but the dialogue between characters is strong and there's just enough intrigue implied throughout to make you want know what's going to happen next.On the downside, some may find the combat element repetitive but it is fast paced and the dearth of creatures with their different attack patterns should keep things interesting. Boss battles on the other hand are a different kettle of fish, bold and brash with more than a nod to old school 90's boss fights they are tricky and engaging, providing you with a real sense of achievement when you finally succeed in downing the overseer blocking your path.Graphically it's not going to win any awards, lets be honest, it's functional but plenty of set pieces (normally coupled in with the boss fights mentioned above) provide the highlights in what is an average looking game. However the art style has it's own unique character which has been maintained since the original release of Ys, which is charming and beautiful all the way through.This is a solid game, plenty to keep you occupied and with a meaty enough story for each of the playable characters to deserve a playthrough, which is all well and good as if you're out hunting achievements, multiple playthroughs await you. Give it a look, especially if it's on sale, you'll be glad you did.			",262,46,6,47,17,0,31

												So I know I haven't gotten very far into this, but I will say this: If you are a fan of old school hack and slash games like Illusion of Gaia, or Terraigma or even the other games in the Y's series I'd say pick this up. It's simple, fluid controls make combat a breeze, the light RPG elements and combos are fun and the story it self actually holds up pretty well and surprised me at the production values and what I saw! I mean this is not multi-million dollar production, but it does have cut scenes, like-able characters and even some psuedo anime/cg thrown in for good measures. It reminds me of those games of yesterday and I have to say I enjoy it's simplicity and fun combat. A good pick up and play for an hour or two at a time.			",95,11,1,25,6,1,4

												Ys Origin is a fast-paced hack and slash rpg, there is no staying behind and preparing your mana... Thats probably the same as giving away openings to your enemies in this game.I love these kinds of games, and cannot wait for them to release it for the PS Vita! Ys Oath in Felghana runs on the same engine it appears, but if you want another Ys game but a little bit different, pick up Ys Seven, it's awesome.Played this game for 40 minutes, and im already lovin' it! Haven't faced a boss yet, but im guessing it's very much like Oath in Felghana; learn the moves and dogde them, look for openings, and try not to take any damage (make sure you are at the appropriate level for the boss fight!).Don't worry about being bored grinding up levels, it's not all that boring, it's quite addictive if you enjoy this kind of gameplay. the more hits, the bigger the combo, the more XP you earn, and this is very fast-paced!There's loot to pick up, items and armor to find, checkpoints to activate, and magical objects to obtain that gives you special skills! I've played through Ys Seven on my PS Vita, and it took more than 20 hours to complete!Ys Origin is an addictive and fun game that you should check out on youtube. If it strikes your fancy, i recommend you pick it up!			",91,16,4,13,6,0,2

												I never played Ys Origin before until I take it on Steam. I'm a big fan of the Ys serie. Whatever is the console I never miss the chance to buy one of these games. Ys Origin is one of best of the serie. Ys games are one of best in the genre hack&slash platformer.  You don't play these games for graphics or story but for the gameplay.  All of rest (graphic, soundtrack, story) is bonus.I first played with Yunica because she is the one who seem more as Adol Christin. But I'll surely replay with the 2 others characters because it's too fun and good.			",127,10,6,28,5,0,14

												""Ys Origin is a Japanese action role-playing game developed and published by Nihon Falcom for Microsoft Windows in 2006."" (Wikipedia, November 2013)I've played this RPG for 45 hours on the hardest of the 5 difficulties (nightmare, hard, normal, easy, very easy) with ""Hugo"" (1 of 3 characters) and completed it by level 52. I found the story to be a run-of-the-mill ""good guy wants power, turns evil temporarily, and repents through the power of friendship/love"". I'm generally not the type of guy to delve into, and enjoy, the story of a game very much anyways, so I didn't mind it. In fact, considering that I look for ""great gameplay"" in games, and what type of gameplay I'll tend to go for, I would practically expect a story to be ""the usual"" in a game (not to say I haven't enjoyed original stories). I don't know how the story goes with the other 2 characters, since I haven't played them yet.This game, played with a top-down camera angle, plays kinda like a shooter when Hugo is the chosen character, as his attacks revolve around shooting magic missiles straight ahead of him. After a quick test run, the other 2 characters appear to revolve around close-range melee combat. On the hardest difficulty level, the bosses offer such a challenge that you'll find yourself grinding a lot, just to gain that extra level or two and be able to defeat the boss at all (and even then, your battle strategy better be near perfect). This game has some simple puzzle-solving, if you can even call it that. You'll find yourself having to press buttons, defeat certain enemies, obtain and use items/skills, and so on. I did enjoy the challenging gameplay, but it would get frustrating at times with bosses, and also 1 time with a certain enemy that can practically insta-kill you (but that you'll still have to deal with). The only thing to do there is keep looking around for equipment and the like, and grind in special spots to gain levels.If you want to know how nice the graphics look, just ""You-Google-Tube"" some gameplay footage on the game. And while you're at it, check out the soundtrack for it as well. It's pretty awesome. As of this post, the game is normally $19.99 USD on Steam and I'd say it's worth the price if you love to spend many hours on a challenging ""battle-grind"" RPG. If it turns-out that you love the game, then you may also love ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"", which follows a similar gaming style. You may want to avoid Ys I & II though, which has your main attack revolve around ramming into enemies (like in Hydlide), which ruins any sense of ""gameplay"" (at least in my opinion).

												Definitely love this game. Even though this game is straightforward, like no visiting towns, caves or things like that. The entire game takes place in a Tower. I love playing as Toal Fact (Hugo Fact's older brother). He has a few comical encounters with one of the Darklings named Epona regarding Hugo. LOL Definitely recommend this game.

												Solid action RPG fun, 3 different characters to play with each with their own unique fighting styles and storys, each path takes around 8 hours.Game difficulty is medium, with boss fights being a particular difficulty spike.  However they each have their weaknesses and are quite fun to fight.This game plays similarly to Ys: The Oath in Felghana, however both of these games play very differently to the two Ys: Chronicles games.

												There are several reasons you should invest in this game.1: It has the old school RPG feel mixed with Legend of Zelda.2: The gameplay is superb and the storyline stays pretty linear and detailed throughout.3: The opening animation is long, but worth the gander for a new game.4: Ys is a franchise that has been around for years, and still to this day have a loyal and dedicated fan base. Can Square Enix and Final Fantasy say that?Finally: It will keep you entertained for hours.			",172,48,4,30,5,1,11

												Ys Origin (and the Ys series for that matter) is an odd combination of RPG/Platform/Puzzler but that doesn't stop it from being a surprisingly enjoyable game.The RPG elements are light, with upgradable equipment, attack choices and bonuses to pick up from defeated monsters in a arcade style way of handling temporary buffs. Story-line wise, there's nothing ground breaking here with some 'world is ending, must save it' fayre but the dialogue between characters is strong and there's just enough intrigue implied throughout to make you want know what's going to happen next.On the downside, some may find the combat element repetitive but it is fast paced and the dearth of creatures with their different attack patterns should keep things interesting. Boss battles on the other hand are a different kettle of fish, bold and brash with more than a nod to old school 90's boss fights they are tricky and engaging, providing you with a real sense of achievement when you finally succeed in downing the overseer blocking your path.Graphically it's not going to win any awards, lets be honest, it's functional but plenty of set pieces (normally coupled in with the boss fights mentioned above) provide the highlights in what is an average looking game. However the art style has it's own unique character which has been maintained since the original release of Ys, which is charming and beautiful all the way through.This is a solid game, plenty to keep you occupied and with a meaty enough story for each of the playable characters to deserve a playthrough, which is all well and good as if you're out hunting achievements, multiple playthroughs await you. Give it a look, especially if it's on sale, you'll be glad you did.			",262,46,6,47,17,0,31

												This is one of my most favorite games. The entire game takes place in a giant tower, but you can play as multiple characters and the story changes depending on who you play as. The gameplay is thoroughly enjoyable, and the music is outstanding. The boss fights are a good challenge on hard difficulty and are very fair in that you can dodge just about everything with practice and/or playing very carefully. For me, melee is much more fun, so I recommend against starting with Hugo, but he does get a shield spell that makes the game a lot easier.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I know I haven't gotten very far into this, but I will say this: If you are a fan of old school hack and slash games like Illusion of Gaia, or Terraigma or even the other games in the Y's series I'd say pick this up. It's simple, fluid controls make combat a breeze, the light RPG elements and combos are fun and the story it self actually holds up pretty well and surprised me at the production values and what I saw! I mean this is not multi-million dollar production, but it does have cut scenes, like-able characters and even some psuedo anime/cg thrown in for good measures. It reminds me of those games of yesterday and I have to say I enjoy it's simplicity and fun combat. A good pick up and play for an hour or two at a time.			",95,11,1,25,6,1,4

												As the first game of the Ys series i played, it was a great experience! It got even better when i found out whilst playing through my first run that actual members of quintet came from famicom! fyi, quintet was a legendary team of game developers who made the gaia series, a trilogy of imo the greatest action rpgs ever made.Anyhows back to Ys: It's full of action, every room you find yourself slashing your way through monsters (or firing your lazers as hugo)! The boss fights are always compelling, i liked the way you could simply jump onto most of the bosses at whack em on the head!The story is compelling, and i won't spoiler, but to understand most of what is going on you should play through at least once with all the characters~I recommend this to anyone who loves action rpgs or hack n' slashes, its a great game and it has brought me to love the world of Ys!

The soundtrack to this game is also rather well done.

												The combat is really fun for the most part and the bosses, while a step up in difficulty, are quite fun.  The game has a very Old School RPG feel.  There are multiple storylines to play through and depending on the difficulty each one takes some time to complete.  This game is well worth the money.  I've never played a Ys game before this and this is quite a good start.  My only dislike about the game is the lack of customization.  Yes, battles are fun.  Yes, the story is interesting.  But, there is no cusomization option.  There are no side-grades only upgrades, so you really just wait to see what you find next to powerup.  Other than that though I do enjoy it.

												Ys Origin is an ARPG similar to games like Legend of Mana or Legacy of Goku. The game tells the story of two children(?) whom are traveling with their people to find their deities that seem to have gotten captured. You pick one of the two characters, each offering a ""unique"" story but ultimately the same main points are hit the same and you play through the exact same levels. What keeps this fresh is that the two characters offer a completely different play style, one is like a tank the other a mage (there's also a third one who plays like a berserker) so there's a little replayability. The stories are mildly interesting nothing ground breaking, it's pretty much every jrpg ever so you climb the tower, find bad guys, things aren't what they seem to be, etc. I'm being a little harsh on the story, many may like it far more than me but after playing games like The Walking Dead and Ni no Kuni it seems lacking in comparision. I reccomend this game to any ARPG lovers or JRPG fans in general.8/10			",205,45,3,15,10,3,22

												A solid piece of hack-and-slash platformery (is that even a word?)  with rpg elements thrown in. The graphics leave a little to be desired- I recommend watching the trailer to see if they're your cup of tea- and the story is a tad cliche, but that doesn't stop Ys Origin from being a fun-filled romp.

												Great game. The combination of lightning fast combat and perfectly balanced difficulty means that every level gained, item upgraded, or new item found will dramatically improve your chances in the glorious boss battles.It may not be a deep game in terms of upgrade paths or character customization, but  its focus means that every moment, every boss battle is wonderfully tuned.Multiple characters (with different stories for each), time attack mode, and some challenging achievements offer extra content beyond a single dungeon run, but even without them this game is more than worth the asking price.

												definitely one of my favourite action rpgs ever. responsive combat, with plenty of features and the graphics are quite good for the time. but story is probably not one of its strongest points, its not bad but you can kinda see a plot twist coming and this is after playing both ys on steam.this game also has one of the best soundtracks in an ARPG. but what really makes this game is so f*cking good is the bossfights.every ys ive played has exciting bossfights that really pump your brain. im not exactly the most hardcore gamer out there, so to me the difficulties are just right and every death is fair since you probably just screwed up dodging that laser or over jumped something.would totally hope for another ys on steam.

												Do you want twitch gameplay?Do you want a game where, the better your do, the faster you progress?Do you want a game where you can play 3+ times and get 3 stories?Then buy Ys Orgiin. It's a complete blast of an action RPG. You whack at enemies, and the more you do it in succession, the higher your XP multiplier goes - and therefore, the stronger your character will be.  It combines old-world arcade games with new-type action RPGs. I've rarely had this much fun with any other Steam-available game.			",119,20,2,30,7,1,6

												Pros: -Snazzy music(might be worth downloading the soundtrack even if you're not into the game)-Fast paced-Skill based difficulty-Great boss fightsCons:-Graphics are quite poor outside of a few anime cutscenes(character models are alright but environments and stuff are ugly)-Menus were not properly ported to keyboard + mouse(they work but are wonky and frustrating to get used to)-RPG aspects are very shallow, if you can even call them that. There's really no customization, only progressionOther thoughts-Story is pretty mediocre.

The combat is incredibly smooth and fast-paced and it doesn't take long to start enjoying running down enemies left and right, unless they are the insane boss fights of course. It doesn't try to impress in the story department as much, but what it has is fine. I haven't even mentioned the incredible soundtrack that keeps you excited to continue forwards.

												Ys Origin, aka ""Wizard Supremacy"" aka ""The Melancholy of Yunica Tovah"" aka ""Super♥♥♥♥♥♥Boy"", is the first in the franchise to allot you a choice of characters with which to begin your adventure; you can even play as wizard, thus invalidating all the other choices. Set almost a millenium before Ys I, Origin poses many questions: what happened to the seas of water, lava, toxic blood and the entire desert stuck inside the Devil's Tower between games, and where could they ever possibly go? With his magical Gradius options, main character Hugo Fact is prepared to solve these mysteries with none of the usual conditions for success required of other lesser protagonists, such as being limited by range, having to follow a set attack progression and not just fill the screen with an endless torrent of projectiles that eventually causes the overwracked sound driver to start playing effects half a second late, and actually taking damage when hit. Buy Ys Origin and be a wizard today!			",80,13,0,12,4,0,7

Most of the dungeon tunes are technical speed metal obviously performed entirely on synths. Nonetheless it fits perfectly. And that's the thing with Ys Origin. All of the pieces come together and make a surprisingly excellent package. Highly Recommended!!			",653,186,30,90,49,9,46

A playthough can take to 15-20 hours to complete, with 3 characters you can go to 60 hours and you have different difficulties to go with if you want it to be more challenging. There is also the boss rush mode that unlocked when you finish the game where you must take on all the bosses of the game without pause or healing, really nice mode.			",86,51,0,32,2,0,5

												A solid hacky-slashy JRPG, Origin is the release followup to Oath & storyline prequel to Ys I & II (which are on steam,btw). The three main characters in the game play quite differently from each other, Yunica feeling pretty close to Adol's style in Oath, while Hugo is more shmup-ey. The gameplay is pretty much as fast as Oath was, although a bit easier if compared to it,which is a good thing if you thought Oath was hard...Graphically. it's once again the same deal as Oath. The game is old so it runs on toasters, but it looks great if you can bump up stuff like AA and AF to the max and maintain 60FPS, making the whole package feel fluid.To sum: If you like hack-slash JRPG's, it's a pretty great game to play.

												It's the game Falcom made after Oath in Felghana. The combat system is even more polished, the boss battles even more crazy, the music even more fantastic (in places), and the player characters even more talkactive. While it lacks an overworld it doesn't skimp on providing an interesting and varied labyrinth to go through. If you haven't bought Oath in Felghana yet, you should. If you haven't, you'll find what I wrote above (in parts) easy to believe! Origin improves on the amazing gameplay of its predecessor, while adding more to be awed at! And it's a real PC exclusive game!As before, though, might be too hardcore for some. Graphics were good for their time, but aren't spectacular now. You don't need to care about the story.

 Note 1: This is currently being played on Nightmare difficulty. That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.) Note 2: I will be comparing this to Oath in Felghana's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion.      This is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint  not  a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order.      For those of you that don't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were ""tweaked"" or ""improved,"" rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series.      Now, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it).      In Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine.      The second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't  need  it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out.      Regarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life.      On the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly ""harder""). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin.      Boss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one.      This, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks.      To compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment.      Upgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.

												Ys Origin! The game is amazing if only for its music. But the gameplay is awesome too! It is also different from other Ys games because you have mutliple characters with different stories. They go through the same locales, but they have very differenet playing styles and different cutscenes. It reminds me a bit of Sonic Adventure 2, where you have the Hero and Dark paths. The same basic mechanics are on both sides, but the story is different.Either way, it is a really fun game and has difficulty settings from the chill game player to the crazy gamer. It is on the upper escelon of action games that you probably didn't play.			",71,22,1,16,5,0,9

												In my opinion, this is the best Ys title currently available on Steam/PC.If you've played other Ys games, you know what to expect. Compared to the other titles, Origin is reasonably short (roughly 6 hours) but has 3 playable characters. Playing the game with all three characters does add a significant amount of replay value, as they play completely differently, and also have some unique story elements. Once you're done with the three main campaigns, there's also an arena mode for an extra challenge.As usual, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the controls are spot on.			",288,67,8,53,28,6,51

												This was my first YS game and I loved it. Story wise, you need to play the game at least twice to get the true plot of the game. Gameplay wise, its pretty simple and there isn't much of a difficulty curve. Boss fights can be challenging. Overall this game offers a ton of replay value and I completely recommend it for someone looking for a simple but fun action RPG.			",119,39,0,37,5,2,27

												Picked up some colorful a** f*** vocabulary because of this f***ing game.This was my first introduction to the Ys series and I must say this was the first game in a long while that has challenged me in skill and not luck. By that I mean, this game actually takes skill to play as opposed to some ""difficult"" games which don't rely on player skill as opposed to how lucky you get on attack patterns, monster spawns, etc.I played as Yunica on Nightmare mode on my first (and so far only) play through. --------------------------------------------------------------------Likes: -fluid feel of the game movement and attacks-especially enjoyed the invulerability frame of the lightning spell and the fact that it took skill to use correctly (and i felt was almost absolutely required while playing nightmare mode)-Most of all I enjoyed the difficulty and uniqueness of each and every boss you fought. Each boss had its own way to be defeated which wasn't simply ""Smack till dieded""Dislikes:-Don't unlock a special character until you've beaten the game once...-Need to play the game with said special character just to unlock secret ending & secret boss fight-Too much running around on occassion-Game requires a bit of grinding to be able to progress if you're playing higher difficulties--------------------------------------------------------------------All in all, 10/10. Highly recommend the game. I also highly recommend nightmare mode first try if you enjoy a challenge like me, even though everyone recommends against nightmare mode first try :p			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not going to overly complicate this. This a fun, fast paced Action RPG that fits well into the general YS lore and story. I admit that some people may not have the paitence for it and the unskippable cutscenes may put some people off, but if you have the time to sit down and play through, My advice is put on some headphones, crank up the volume, and lose yourself in the awesome music and the simple yet generally fun combat of Ys. Even if you finish through one story and find yourself wanting for more, you still have two more characters and a lot of extra content to get through.This game becomes incredibly cheap when on sale, i personally got it for less than £5 and it definitely felt worth over double that.To summerise, If you have the time and like a good fast paced action RPG...

Sure you do the same thing in Persona 3 but Ys: Origin does it's story so well that you don't ever need to leave the tower. And with 3 distinct characters and a group of NPCs really make for a rich story.With challenging bosses and diverse environments, and various difficulty levels make this game easy to pick up and play a few on the fly.

												The ones that would appreciate this game the most are fan of Ys because it’s a prequel for the first Ys games. But that doesn’t mean this can’t be enjoyed by newcomers. It has that classic SNES adventure feel but will enhanced graphics like all other Ys games. There are multiple characters you can play in story mode but replaying story mode for minor changes in dialogue and events for the first two characters was tedious. The main replay-ability is in arena and boss mode. Overall the sprite animation is an improvement over Ys: The Oath in Felghana and most replay focus is on extras. It’s worth picking up for what it is and if you are already a fan of the Ys franchise you’ll enjoy the lore.			",51,4,0,6,1,0,1

												It's a pretty decent hack'n'slash ARPG, if that's all you're looking for, but it doesn't particularly stand out unless you're there for the Ys part of it. The combat is solid but doesn't have a ton of depth. The characters are likable but don't have a ton of depth. The story is your standard ""bad guys did something bad; now the good guys better do something about it"" fare, so it won't carry anything on its own (not to mention it only shows up for a few minutes of exposition every hour or so). It would be a fairly satisfying little timekiller that doesn't really stand out in any way except for one thing: a lot of the unlocks feel like they're on a free-to-play schedule in a non-free-to-play game.The higher tier upgrades in the story mode take an absurd amount of grinding to pay for. Can't beat a boss? Grind some levels, because a single level's worth of stats will make an enormous difference in the damage you deal/take. Two levels will change a fight from brutally hard to a pushover (although that's more ""return of the 90s"" than ""when free-to-play games attack""). There are a bunch of bonus game modes you can unlock and extra characters and alternate character versions with different attacks and all sorts of stuff like that, but they require beating the entire story mode so many times (and weirdly, most of the achievement requirements are also ""beat the game multiple times"") that I'm guessing at least 90% of people will never even see things like arena mode. I know I certainly won't, even though I'd try it out if it were available immediately after having beaten the game the first time. It makes Korean MMOs look like they're concerned that you don't get outside enough.Aside from that, it's fun enough, but I'd mostly only recommend it to people who want more backstory to the Ys games.

												Ys Origin, aka ""Wizard Supremacy"" aka ""The Melancholy of Yunica Tovah"" aka ""Super♥♥♥♥♥♥Boy"", is the first in the franchise to allot you a choice of characters with which to begin your adventure; you can even play as wizard, thus invalidating all the other choices. Set almost a millenium before Ys I, Origin poses many questions: what happened to the seas of water, lava, toxic blood and the entire desert stuck inside the Devil's Tower between games, and where could they ever possibly go? With his magical Gradius options, main character Hugo Fact is prepared to solve these mysteries with none of the usual conditions for success required of other lesser protagonists, such as being limited by range, having to follow a set attack progression and not just fill the screen with an endless torrent of projectiles that eventually causes the overwracked sound driver to start playing effects half a second late, and actually taking damage when hit. Buy Ys Origin and be a wizard today!			",80,13,0,12,4,0,7

I rarely play games with all available characters, but I did it on this one; it is just too much fun not to!  I have played all the other Ys games that are available in English, but this is a great one to start with...it is called Origin, after all.			",44,18,0,6,2,0,0

												I've never been into the kind of games that Ys: Origin is, however I think that this is the game that turns me just ever so slightly. The graphics are nothing to write home about, and neither is the narrative, however the solid and tactile ARPG gameplay glued me to the game when not much else did. A fantastic gameplay experience, and with multiple characters with different paths of play it also has great replay value. Recommended for sure.			",178,53,2,20,9,0,29

												OI, completely forgot to recommend this game.It's a bit easier than Ys Oath in Felghana, and it has more characters to choose from instead of just Adol, which means more replayability, but a single playthrough of Felghana is longer than a single playthrough of Origins. At least, was so in my case, even if I had to actually grind a bit in Oath.It's just awesome and you should play it. Such a satisfying game, with awesome bosses to beat up. The only flaw is that some characters lack ways to efficiently deal with some monsters, but it's kinda obvious..Is da orkiest stuffz dere is in dis 'ere game - ya hav' da Weirdboy wif gut dakka, gerl wif gitty hat an'♥♥♥♥♥♥ an' da orky Kommando only choppin' and choppin'.

												Even though Ys Origin is now a relatively old game (it was first released by the end of 2006), it still has plenty to offer to RPG fans:   - Beautiful graphics, both in-game and cutscenes   - Simple and intuitive graphic user interface   - Very fun, rewarding, fast-paced action that hardly gets old   - Challenging bosses that will make you rethink your playing strategy   - Not one, nor two... but three different game stories that seemly complement each otherDefinitely a great introduction to the Ys series and great improvement from the previously released title, The Oath in Felghana, except maybe in the soundtrack which in my humble opinion lacked that trilling component that made me want to carry on shredding monsters just to keep hearing the track. However, this is more than compensated by the deeply intriguing game stories; more than once I found myself playing an extra hour just to find out what was going to happen next.Overall, even if you're one of those players that rush through games (which I highly discourage with this one), Ys Origin is guaranteed to give you a good 30+ hours of gameplay any noteworthy action RPG should.

												If you liked Ys: Oath in Felghana, you'll almost certainly like Ys: Origin. It uses the same game engine, but with gameplay improvements. There are three characters to play as, with different fighting styles - while Yunica plays much like Adol, Hugo is an entirely different style with a very simple basic attack but more interesting skills, requiring better and more frequent use of them with a more defensive play style.All the usual highlights of an Ys game come back too - polished art, rockin' music, metroidvania-type exploration, and interesting bosses. Definitely worth it, but if you're still unsure, there's a demo you can try.			",94,15,0,20,15,0,13

												After playing Ys I + 2, and Ys: Oath in Felghana, I had high expectations for this one. They were met and exceeded.* Great music * Great gameplay - boss fights are amazing, and beating a boss on the higher difficulty settings is really satisfying* Responsive controls - if you fail at the game, it's on you, not the controller* Three different characters to play as, with different styles and viewpoints of the game's events* Difficulty options are appreciated. I did a hard playthrough and a couple of easy playthoughs because I was a little more interested in story things than brutal gameplayI'll probably come back to this one later for a nightmare difficulty playthrough. Or three.Only real downside is the game setting and pacing is pretty much the same for all of the characters, so the third playthrough started to wear on me a bit. In hindsight, I shouldn't have played through it 3x without any other games mixed in to keep things fresh.Nice Bonus - the .ogg files work with my mp3 player, unlike Oath of Felghana's.

												Fans of the Ys Series, rejoice in learning the origin of the legends which the first two games are based off of. The game primarily revolves around either Yunica Tovah or Hugo Fact, and yes, those family names should be familiar to those who've played the first two games. Each of them plays differently, with some mechanics making some fights a lot easier than others, some more difficult.This game serves as the seventh canonical entry in the Ys series (Ys V is non-canon), and as a prequel to the entire series. It does a lot to explain a lot of the lore in the first two games, as well as why even in the main series, there is always a seemingly world ending threat around the corner.The game has three characters, two of which are available from the start: Yunica Tovah and Hugo Fact. The third is unlockable after beating the game with either one and finishes the story with its true ending. Even if you don't beat it with him, there is still a lot that is canon from Yunica and Hugo's endings, just not the true mastermind, a very familiar enemy who was responsible for the events in Ys I & II.Killing normal enemies is rather easy, and if you are having trouble, go back to a previous zone and grind a couple of levels, then come back. You will easily know when you've grinded enough in a zone when the experience rewards vs. the amount needed to level becomes more grindy than the time needed is worth. Basically, if you need to level, you can gain   a level in about 10 - 15 minutes, sooner if you're on the low side for the zone.Still, the main focus is the bosses. Each has unique mechanics and weaknesses that you need to take into account. Don't be surprised if you die a few times figuring out the boss, and if your attention slips, or you make a wrong move, then you are in for a world of hurt. That's where the fun is.

												Ys Origin is another classic in the series that welcomes newcomers and veterans. I found t interesting that Darm Tower was the main focus in setting, I really liked exploring around in Ys I & II, but regardless, it makes up with lots of great challenges, especially if you dare tackle Nightmare mode.You get to play multiple characters in the game, starting with 2, then unlocking a new one after you finish the game, and some cool modes if you crave for more Ys Origin action. The story is well written and kept me interested through the end. I highly recommend this to Ys fans, JRPG fans and for those who are brand new to the genre. It is another classic in the Ys series.

The combat is incredibly smooth and fast-paced and it doesn't take long to start enjoying running down enemies left and right, unless they are the insane boss fights of course. It doesn't try to impress in the story department as much, but what it has is fine. I haven't even mentioned the incredible soundtrack that keeps you excited to continue forwards.

												Sorry for this naive first review of mine. I'll make sure to come back later and polish it up. :)I've never played any Ys game before, but I'm thoroughly enjoying my playthrough so far. Only about 6 floors in so I have no idea howmuch there is left and I'm repeatedly getting my rear handed to me on nightmare mode first playthrough. I have to say this is one of the few games where constant death doesn't bother me as it generally feels like I made a mistake.So far the enemies have been scaling really well in all of their drops, and anytime I get stuck on a boss (so far both I've run into one) I don't mind going back and grinding a level or two to beef up my stats and try again and feel a noticeable difference. Leveling feels really solid so far as I feel a discernible, if not momentous, difference each time I gain a level, and makes me feel rewarded for hard work.The controls feel pretty tight with the combat and platforming working very well to challenge your mastery of the game's mechanics. I can't say I've blamed hitboxes or funky camera angles so far whenever I fail to make a jump or whatnot, and that's a solid plus in my book.Want a challenging game that could very well dunk you on the first practice fight? (Yea that happened, and it felt great). Do you enjoy platforming? Do you like feeling rewarded every time you grind up a level or want upgrades that make you think about a purchase? This game is probably for you.			",23,5,0,19,4,0,6

												If you are already a Falcom fan, then I don't need to encourage you more to go play it. Ys Origin brings you the tale of 700 years before the first game. The epic conflict you had in the first game is finally revealed, and what a Hell of a start it is. In terms of story it stands strong, and playing between each character may cause the game to feel repeatable, but it's actually done well. The gameplay may feel a bit stiff or slippery from time to time, but that's because Ys wasn't made to be this combo-ish action game; Adol isn't in it though, so I think that's where the problem lies. It's easy to get to the 100% clearing, but for 100% upgrades you really need to have a love for grinding. And as always in true Ys fashion, if you think this game isn't hard enough there is the Hellish ""Nightmare"" mode. It offers enough variety for you to play on and a loveable story. Though it may look weird from a linair look, this being Ys 0, the gap of 700 years should indicate that this one will stand on its own like it should be.			",82,8,0,9,3,0,0

There is nothing that compares to the feeling of satisfaction one gets from beating an Ys boss on the nightmare difficulty setting.

												The combat is really fun for the most part and the bosses, while a step up in difficulty, are quite fun.  The game has a very Old School RPG feel.  There are multiple storylines to play through and depending on the difficulty each one takes some time to complete.  This game is well worth the money.  I've never played a Ys game before this and this is quite a good start.  My only dislike about the game is the lack of customization.  Yes, battles are fun.  Yes, the story is interesting.  But, there is no cusomization option.  There are no side-grades only upgrades, so you really just wait to see what you find next to powerup.  Other than that though I do enjoy it.

Well, you're right and wrong.While it's true to normal mobs, the boss fight itself especially in nightmare difficulty is one hell of a fight.You're required to fail and die a dozen times while learning the boss attack pattern, thinking about different approach and strategy before finally beat the crap out of it.Sadly, the calculation of stats in this game is not RPG-like.Gaining just one level can make a big difference in boss fight, especially in early game.

												So, what is it you want from a game? Pretty visuals? An excellent story? Intense action? A challenge? If the answer to the last two questions are ""yes"", you should try this game. The anime/JRPG style visuals may not be everyone's cup of tea, so take that into account. The story is by no means bad, but nothing that'll keep you at the edge of your seat. But there are some really good reasons why to play this game. First of all, the gameplay. Fast-paced and fluid hack&slash action typical for an ARPG with the difference that it has a vertical dimension as well, adding some platforming to the whole concept. Initially you get to pick between two characters, and can unlock a third one. The story remains more or less the same (it's best described as 3 different points of view), but there are significant differences in how the characters are played, each of the 3 offers a unique gameplay experience. You can pick either a controller or the KB/mouse duo, both work just fine. The configuration tool is user-friendly and offers a lot of freedom in defining your desired configuration.There are five difficulty levels, ranging from ""very easy"" to ""nightmare"". The game is quite challenging, don't be shy to try it on a lower difficulty if you just don't seem to move forward. The strongest point of this game are the numerous and intense boss-battles, which test your reflexes and wits alike. You won't get anywhere with the ""hit it until it stops moving"" idea even on ""very easy"". Expect to hit the retry button numerous times, sometimes it's not obvious what you need to do from the start. Explore and experiment, it's fun! Finished story mode with all 3 characters? The game still has replay value! In the Time Attack mode, you can test your mettle against the game's bosses without having to replay the whole game again. And it doesn't end there. While Time attack can be played right after completing the game with one character, once you clear the story mode with all 3, you gain access to Arena Mode, where you fight waves of enemies from the level of your choice and collect SP (the game's currency) to unlock bonus content. The soundtrack is simply amazing. Masterpiece after masterpiece, greatly adding to the enjoyment the game has to offer.If ""challenge"" is your middle name, then you shouldn't miss this game.The verdict: 8.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"" and loved it, you'll love this too. More action platforming at it's best with a longer playthrough time then it's predecessor and multiple characters to play as for increases replayablility.			",287,67,5,70,17,4,50

												Ys Origins is a hack and slash platformer action RPG. You run around as one of 3 (only 2 are available before beating the game) classes and kill demons and level up increasing your damage, damage reduction, and hp. The gameplay itself is simple and fun. It has a pretty good story, an amazing soundtrack, and a ton of replayability. It's replayability factors come in an altered story for each character, boss rush modes, arena modes, achievments, and unlockables. Overall a really good game.			",386,88,7,71,16,0,29

												Pros: Really great selection of tools with uses in combat and in puzzles, varied and interesting enemy designs, superb boss fights, very energetic soundtrack.Cons: Poor feedback when hit (there's no sound effect, just a red number that pops up that I missed a few times,) Bosses have VERY deep health pools when compared to how easily some enemies will fall so a certain degree of grinding may be necessary, and you can't pause the game when fighting a boss (I think this is to prevent players from teleporting out of the room to avoid a loss or something, but I should still be able to pause the game.)Even with those issues I still had a great time. Strongly recommended.			",154,17,6,4,1,0,4

												Ys Origin is an ARPG similar to games like Legend of Mana or Legacy of Goku. The game tells the story of two children(?) whom are traveling with their people to find their deities that seem to have gotten captured. You pick one of the two characters, each offering a ""unique"" story but ultimately the same main points are hit the same and you play through the exact same levels. What keeps this fresh is that the two characters offer a completely different play style, one is like a tank the other a mage (there's also a third one who plays like a berserker) so there's a little replayability. The stories are mildly interesting nothing ground breaking, it's pretty much every jrpg ever so you climb the tower, find bad guys, things aren't what they seem to be, etc. I'm being a little harsh on the story, many may like it far more than me but after playing games like The Walking Dead and Ni no Kuni it seems lacking in comparision. I reccomend this game to any ARPG lovers or JRPG fans in general.8/10			",205,45,3,15,10,3,22

												Do you want twitch gameplay?Do you want a game where, the better your do, the faster you progress?Do you want a game where you can play 3+ times and get 3 stories?Then buy Ys Orgiin. It's a complete blast of an action RPG. You whack at enemies, and the more you do it in succession, the higher your XP multiplier goes - and therefore, the stronger your character will be.  It combines old-world arcade games with new-type action RPGs. I've rarely had this much fun with any other Steam-available game.			",119,20,2,30,7,1,6

												Can't really place why Origin stands out as my favourite in the Ys series, but it just does. The gameplay is fast, fun and fluid and the boss fights are challenging yet rewarding. Youre standard enemies are easy to kill and don't provide much of a challenge at all, they really only exist to grind if you want to when the bosses start kicking you♥♥♥♥♥ Three main story characters, all of which have unique fighting styles and individual stories, really help to make the game feel whole.On their own, the stories are jagged and a bit weak. The writing is VERY amateurish in my opinion, but that adds to the charm of the game. The sometimes hilariously bad dialogue makes it feel as though you're playing through an early 90's anime, but the incredible combat makes up for it. It's a fast paced game but definitely not for everyone. If you're hesitatnt, i'd recommend checking out some gameplay footage or waiting until it goes on sale.			",244,20,3,46,11,0,22

												This action RPG drips ""old-school"" from its pores. While the series never caught on big in the US during its original releases, these remakes and rereleases are worth a look.There isn't any variation or customization in your character progression, other than the order in which you buy some passive upgrades, so the game will succeed or fail by the gameplay itself. It mostly succeeds here, if you liked Secret of Mana and similar games. There's a great soundtrack to keep you going as well.So what's old-school about it? Two things stand out: the punishing bosses and the level grind. You'll NEED to pick out the boss patterns to beat them. If you're not stopping to spill some extra blood as you play through the game, you'll be underleveled and you will die quickly. This can even happen on normal monsters - if you find yourself dealing weaksauce damage to new monsters, when you used to be cleaving through armies, go back and grind a few levels. Comparative level matters a lot.			",329,122,4,41,17,0,31

												Ys Origin showed an extremely unique graphic and art style which was extremely foreign to me when I first started the game. Upon the first few swings of my axe, I knew I was in for an amazing experience. This game's controls and combat system flow so fluently that every kill drew me further and further into the game. Even on Normal Difficulty this game showed the absolute perfect challenge... Hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Only on one occassion did I ever beat a boss on the first attempt. Unlike most games where a death to a difficult boss would be frustrating; I never wanted to quit, as every death got me more pumped up than the last.The smooth flow of the game wasn't everything. This games soundtrack took me by storm, as I am a sucker for a game's soundtrack. One amazing song after another... This game never grew dull even for a second. The fact that i have written over 20 words about this game should explain just how much I enjoyed it because I hate reading... and writing... and typing.....Basically what I'm trying to say is this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, and now has a place in my list of favourite games. :D			",166,21,1,34,6,0,12

												The Ys (prounounced Ees) series has long ben one of the finer series in Japanese action RPGs. It has been known for being one of the first game series to emphasize story, its brutal bosses,   fantastic rock soundtrack.....and barely ever being imported into the U.S. My own only experience with the series was Ys III, released in 1991, on the Sega GenesisYs Origins is a surprisingly polished game, considering its original release in 2006. With a focus on combat and dungeon exploration, the game feels familiar, but is polished enough to stay entertained enough through its campaign.And what a campaign. Though a single character's story line is no longer than 8 to 9 hours, Ys Origins provides 3 different characters, each with a completely different fighting style, viewpoint in the story, and even differences in area accessability and boss battles. Combined with bonus time attack and boss rush modes, where devoted players can earn special costumes, battles, and even a bonus character, Ys Origin can easily be enjoyed for over 30 hours. Ys Origin is not without flaws. The story is serviceable, but fairly predictable. Some later boss battles can be an exercise in frustration, and you'll wish that they mixed up the dungeons a bit more between characters. However, for anyone looking for a classic, rewarding, challenging action RPG with all of the Japanese trappings, you can do a lot worse than this artifact of the previous decade.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. I started of the Ys series loving the story but hoping that they would make the play style a little more exciting and in this game they really did. They developed different classes with new and exciting skills. And the story let me tell you The story of Ys is great but this installment just made it that much better. It answers a lot of questions  about the history of the world and the religion. This game is a must play even if you dont play the rest of the series. % out of 5 stars!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are already a Falcom fan, then I don't need to encourage you more to go play it. Ys Origin brings you the tale of 700 years before the first game. The epic conflict you had in the first game is finally revealed, and what a Hell of a start it is. In terms of story it stands strong, and playing between each character may cause the game to feel repeatable, but it's actually done well. The gameplay may feel a bit stiff or slippery from time to time, but that's because Ys wasn't made to be this combo-ish action game; Adol isn't in it though, so I think that's where the problem lies. It's easy to get to the 100% clearing, but for 100% upgrades you really need to have a love for grinding. And as always in true Ys fashion, if you think this game isn't hard enough there is the Hellish ""Nightmare"" mode. It offers enough variety for you to play on and a loveable story. Though it may look weird from a linair look, this being Ys 0, the gap of 700 years should indicate that this one will stand on its own like it should be.			",82,8,0,9,3,0,0

												If you enjoy playing action role-playing games (particularly those from Japan), Ys Origin is a solid investment.  At first, the level designs and monsters were fairly basic, but this is not so much of an issue as you progress higher up the tower.  The amount of variety in the demon designs and floor designs later on isn't spectacular, but keep in mind this is all going on inside of a tower.  The bosses--I would say--are the only exception.  The level and skill system revolve around finding new equipment and gems.  Although simple in design, there is just enough variety to keep you interested.  The story itself is alright (at least to the point where I am at...), and the characters aren't too bad.  You won't be interacting with them too much anyway.  In order to improve your character's own abilities and the abilities of some of your weapons and other equipment, the game allows players to cash in the SP dropped by defeated demons.  This SP is cashed in at the game's Goddess statues, which also serve as save points.  Generally, the distance between these save points is just the ""right"" distance.  If you don't know what difficulty to play at, I would recommend the ""normal"" difficulty setting.  Normal might seem too easy at first, but the game becomes significantly harder later on.  However, action RPG veterans will likely want to bump up the difficulty a notch or two.  If not at the normal price, then consider adding Ys Origin to your Steam library the next time the game is on sale.			",210,42,3,16,12,3,23

												As the first game of the Ys series i played, it was a great experience! It got even better when i found out whilst playing through my first run that actual members of quintet came from famicom! fyi, quintet was a legendary team of game developers who made the gaia series, a trilogy of imo the greatest action rpgs ever made.Anyhows back to Ys: It's full of action, every room you find yourself slashing your way through monsters (or firing your lazers as hugo)! The boss fights are always compelling, i liked the way you could simply jump onto most of the bosses at whack em on the head!The story is compelling, and i won't spoiler, but to understand most of what is going on you should play through at least once with all the characters~I recommend this to anyone who loves action rpgs or hack n' slashes, its a great game and it has brought me to love the world of Ys!

												The ones that would appreciate this game the most are fan of Ys because it’s a prequel for the first Ys games. But that doesn’t mean this can’t be enjoyed by newcomers. It has that classic SNES adventure feel but will enhanced graphics like all other Ys games. There are multiple characters you can play in story mode but replaying story mode for minor changes in dialogue and events for the first two characters was tedious. The main replay-ability is in arena and boss mode. Overall the sprite animation is an improvement over Ys: The Oath in Felghana and most replay focus is on extras. It’s worth picking up for what it is and if you are already a fan of the Ys franchise you’ll enjoy the lore.			",51,4,0,6,1,0,1

												One of the best JRPG game to have on STEAM. Don't be fooled by the old-school graphics. This game provides fast paced action, HUGE bosses, and a solid storyline that would make you want to play it after you beat it once! 2 available and unlockable characters, solid short but unique inventory system, diverse stages, beautiful soundtracks and anime style artworks...What else could you ask for?

												If you're a fan of tough as nails Action-RPG games, with boss fight that demands really on-point reflexes and quick thinking, then this game is for you. The game takes place inside one big tower that you climb, finding items and secrets along the way, and uncovering the reason behind the disappearance of the two Goddess. With 3 Different playthrought, each of them having very different playstyle and a few different bosses, you can get alot of hours of fun. When you finish the story, you can also explore the optional modes : Boss Rush and Arena mode, in which you can test your skills fighting waves of ennemies or bosses.I'd recommend playing on nightmare to experience the full intensity of the boss fights, which really, is what makes the Ys serie so good.

												Probably the quickest I've ever gone from demo to purchase.As Ys tends to go, it's a ballbuster, but a damn fun one.  Combat is surprisingly flexible for its simplicity.  The set piece boss fights are creative, complex, and completely unforgiving, but for the most part tuned very well -- a player who's practiced up can take them down reliably and feel like a total badass in the process.  Experience gain is tuned to scale based on the level difference between you and your opponent, so you catch up very quickly when underleveled but can always crank out an extra level for an edge against something.There are exceptions, of course.  Kishgal is capable of randomly screwing you depending on which moves he does in succession, and a couple bosses (Gelaldy, Pictimos) are long and tedious enough to stop feeling fun after the first half of their HP bar.  The latter third of the game is extremely melee-unfriendly, and poor Yunica is largely reduced to spamming one special attack.			",46,33,0,30,2,0,6

												Previously cleared this prequel of YS  when the original Japanese version was released for PC, but purchased and cleared again for nostalgia when it was re-released on Steam. Gameplay (as stated in another review of YS) is action-RPG'ish (resembling both Zelda and Diablo), as the player controls the main character from an overhead third person view. Characters can be unlocked within the game, offering up to 4 (one is unofficially unlocked) different selections each with their own types of skill sets. Characters can level up and acquire a set of sword-skills and magic to demolish enemies that are encountered throughout the game. Storyline is paced well, but can be tedious to understand, as the lore of YS is quite deep in this version of the game. Must play as all three storyline characters to completely understand each of their motives. Music is also amazing, setting the tone of each and every stage the character enters. Graphics are outdated by modern standards, but the gameplay and music completely allow the user to forget about it. Played through the entire game with all three characters (Yunica/Hugo/Toal).Highly recommend. 5 out of 5 stars.			",49,3,2,3,2,0,2

												This action RPG drips ""old-school"" from its pores. While the series never caught on big in the US during its original releases, these remakes and rereleases are worth a look.There isn't any variation or customization in your character progression, other than the order in which you buy some passive upgrades, so the game will succeed or fail by the gameplay itself. It mostly succeeds here, if you liked Secret of Mana and similar games. There's a great soundtrack to keep you going as well.So what's old-school about it? Two things stand out: the punishing bosses and the level grind. You'll NEED to pick out the boss patterns to beat them. If you're not stopping to spill some extra blood as you play through the game, you'll be underleveled and you will die quickly. This can even happen on normal monsters - if you find yourself dealing weaksauce damage to new monsters, when you used to be cleaving through armies, go back and grind a few levels. Comparative level matters a lot.			",329,122,4,41,17,0,31

												After playing Ys I + 2, and Ys: Oath in Felghana, I had high expectations for this one. They were met and exceeded.* Great music * Great gameplay - boss fights are amazing, and beating a boss on the higher difficulty settings is really satisfying* Responsive controls - if you fail at the game, it's on you, not the controller* Three different characters to play as, with different styles and viewpoints of the game's events* Difficulty options are appreciated. I did a hard playthrough and a couple of easy playthoughs because I was a little more interested in story things than brutal gameplayI'll probably come back to this one later for a nightmare difficulty playthrough. Or three.Only real downside is the game setting and pacing is pretty much the same for all of the characters, so the third playthrough started to wear on me a bit. In hindsight, I shouldn't have played through it 3x without any other games mixed in to keep things fresh.Nice Bonus - the .ogg files work with my mp3 player, unlike Oath of Felghana's.

												Can't really place why Origin stands out as my favourite in the Ys series, but it just does. The gameplay is fast, fun and fluid and the boss fights are challenging yet rewarding. Youre standard enemies are easy to kill and don't provide much of a challenge at all, they really only exist to grind if you want to when the bosses start kicking you♥♥♥♥♥ Three main story characters, all of which have unique fighting styles and individual stories, really help to make the game feel whole.On their own, the stories are jagged and a bit weak. The writing is VERY amateurish in my opinion, but that adds to the charm of the game. The sometimes hilariously bad dialogue makes it feel as though you're playing through an early 90's anime, but the incredible combat makes up for it. It's a fast paced game but definitely not for everyone. If you're hesitatnt, i'd recommend checking out some gameplay footage or waiting until it goes on sale.			",244,20,3,46,11,0,22

												I absolutely love this game. As many have already have said, there are two characters to play as initially, with a third being unlocked after you beat the game with either of the first two. I recommend playing the game at least three times, once with each character. The order I played in was: Yunica (close/medium-range), Hugo (medium/long-range), then the secret character (very close-range). All three have interwining stories, and you only get the full picture after beating the game with all three. The story itself is interesting, and makes you want to keep playing long after the credits roll. The good thing about Ys Origin is that you don't need any backstory from the previous games, due to this title being a prequel to the rest of the series. The combat is addictive, with the environments and enemies changing often enough so as not to get repetitive. The soundtrack is sublime, and will make you want to listen to it even outside of the game.I played the game on Normal difficulty, and doing so will probably net you 8-10 hours of game for each character. However, I recommend playing on Hard, because grinding even a little bit on Normal will make the game obscenely easy. Overall, if you like action-RPGs, a great soundtrack, and a great story, you can't go wrong with this one.			",305,96,9,46,33,4,68

It answers a lot of questions  about the history of the world and the religion. This game is a must play even if you dont play the rest of the series. % out of 5 stars!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can play as multiple characters (which don't feel the same at all) and at multiple difficulty levels. High replayability and lots of extra modes make this one you won't put down for a while.If you don't already own this game, you really should.  BUY IT!			",208,43,1,34,2,0,1

												This japanese arpg game is a blast. Awesome storyline, enchanting world, fun bossfights.The enemies in every level are usually pretty easy, but the bossfights are a nice challenge. Most bosses took me a couple hours of retries on the hardest difficulty (playing as Yunica on nightmare, Hugo is much easier). The combat is smooth, fast paced, and pretty simple actually, but it's the bossfights where you have to get a bit creative.Oh and the soundtrack on this one is pure gold.8.5/10			",109,7,2,6,3,0,7

												There are several reasons you should invest in this game.1: It has the old school RPG feel mixed with Legend of Zelda.2: The gameplay is superb and the storyline stays pretty linear and detailed throughout.3: The opening animation is long, but worth the gander for a new game.4: Ys is a franchise that has been around for years, and still to this day have a loyal and dedicated fan base. Can Square Enix and Final Fantasy say that?Finally: It will keep you entertained for hours.			",172,48,4,30,5,1,11

												If you enjoy playing action role-playing games (particularly those from Japan), Ys Origin is a solid investment.  At first, the level designs and monsters were fairly basic, but this is not so much of an issue as you progress higher up the tower.  The amount of variety in the demon designs and floor designs later on isn't spectacular, but keep in mind this is all going on inside of a tower.  The bosses--I would say--are the only exception.  The level and skill system revolve around finding new equipment and gems.  Although simple in design, there is just enough variety to keep you interested.  The story itself is alright (at least to the point where I am at...), and the characters aren't too bad.  You won't be interacting with them too much anyway.  In order to improve your character's own abilities and the abilities of some of your weapons and other equipment, the game allows players to cash in the SP dropped by defeated demons.  This SP is cashed in at the game's Goddess statues, which also serve as save points.  Generally, the distance between these save points is just the ""right"" distance.  If you don't know what difficulty to play at, I would recommend the ""normal"" difficulty setting.  Normal might seem too easy at first, but the game becomes significantly harder later on.  However, action RPG veterans will likely want to bump up the difficulty a notch or two.  If not at the normal price, then consider adding Ys Origin to your Steam library the next time the game is on sale.			",210,42,3,16,12,3,23

												As the first game of the Ys series i played, it was a great experience! It got even better when i found out whilst playing through my first run that actual members of quintet came from famicom! fyi, quintet was a legendary team of game developers who made the gaia series, a trilogy of imo the greatest action rpgs ever made.Anyhows back to Ys: It's full of action, every room you find yourself slashing your way through monsters (or firing your lazers as hugo)! The boss fights are always compelling, i liked the way you could simply jump onto most of the bosses at whack em on the head!The story is compelling, and i won't spoiler, but to understand most of what is going on you should play through at least once with all the characters~I recommend this to anyone who loves action rpgs or hack n' slashes, its a great game and it has brought me to love the world of Ys!

												The combat is really fun for the most part and the bosses, while a step up in difficulty, are quite fun.  The game has a very Old School RPG feel.  There are multiple storylines to play through and depending on the difficulty each one takes some time to complete.  This game is well worth the money.  I've never played a Ys game before this and this is quite a good start.  My only dislike about the game is the lack of customization.  Yes, battles are fun.  Yes, the story is interesting.  But, there is no cusomization option.  There are no side-grades only upgrades, so you really just wait to see what you find next to powerup.  Other than that though I do enjoy it.

												Ys Origin is an ARPG similar to games like Legend of Mana or Legacy of Goku. The game tells the story of two children(?) whom are traveling with their people to find their deities that seem to have gotten captured. You pick one of the two characters, each offering a ""unique"" story but ultimately the same main points are hit the same and you play through the exact same levels. What keeps this fresh is that the two characters offer a completely different play style, one is like a tank the other a mage (there's also a third one who plays like a berserker) so there's a little replayability. The stories are mildly interesting nothing ground breaking, it's pretty much every jrpg ever so you climb the tower, find bad guys, things aren't what they seem to be, etc. I'm being a little harsh on the story, many may like it far more than me but after playing games like The Walking Dead and Ni no Kuni it seems lacking in comparision. I reccomend this game to any ARPG lovers or JRPG fans in general.8/10			",205,45,3,15,10,3,22

												The description for this game does NOT do it justice. The gameplay falls somewhere between Castlevania and Gauntlet. There are a ton of enemy types that each have a weakness for one of three weapons and the abilities that go with them. Infinitely refilling magic capabilities give you an edge against the onslaught. But most importantly, this is a game that rewards risk. That faster and more efficiently you defeat foes, the faster you level, going up to 2x speed. Oh, and the bosses? Classic gaming style oozes from them as you learn patterns and find the weakspots. I bought this blind and couldn't be happier. I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long, long time.

												Ys Origin is an Japanese-style action RPG, set as a prequel to the Ys series. This is the first Ys game I've played, and I've definitely been enjoying it.The game's combat system is the best part of it: normal enemies don't give you much of a challenge because they're easily stun-locked (as Yunica, at least), but the boss battles are intense. The bosses are difficult and they take a while to bring down even if you know what you're doing, but their attacks are easily predicted. It does take some skill to get through it, though (on Normal). The game's story and world are also interesting; it has one of the better game stories I've seen recently.This game is definitely worth considering for any RPG fan, and I would recommend it even at full price to fans of the genre.

												God damnit, this game makes me happy.If you've ever played ""Secret of Mana"", the Japan-only released ""Seiken Densetsu 3"" or even Supergiantgames' ""Bastion"", you pretty much know what to expect from Ys Origin. This is old-school, balls-to-the-walls hack'n'slay action and it is glorious.Combat feels smoth and responsive (as long as you avoid playing as Hugo), the story is cheesy and fun without getting too silly or taking you out of your comfort-zone. You also don't really need to play any previous games to understand what the hell is going on, which is always nice. Boss battles are without a doubt the highlight of the game and especially the ""duels"" with enemy warriors and mages are extremely well-made and memorable in every way. As is the soundtrack, even when it still sounds like really-badly-made-MIDI-file.This game is EXTREMELY linear. Most chests contain mandatory character upgrades and even branching hallways are few and far between. Also, if you are the type of person that is easily bored by a single activity, Ys is probably not for you (although the game tries it's best to mix things up every now and again, to varying success).  For those of you not put off by those things, Ys Origin is a wonderul throwback to simpler times. I can't promise you'll enjoy it but I sure did.			",68,7,3,4,5,0,7

												This is one of my most favorite games. The entire game takes place in a giant tower, but you can play as multiple characters and the story changes depending on who you play as. The gameplay is thoroughly enjoyable, and the music is outstanding. The boss fights are a good challenge on hard difficulty and are very fair in that you can dodge just about everything with practice and/or playing very carefully. For me, melee is much more fun, so I recommend against starting with Hugo, but he does get a shield spell that makes the game a lot easier.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Delightfully old-school action-RPG. Isometric view, 2D sprites on a 3D background, and fast-paced button-mashing combat. It can be rather challenging on the higher difficulties, where bosses both massive and man-sized will repeatedly deliver you a taste of the afterlife. The story drives the action nicely and sets up for the events of Ys I&II, but it's not the most memorable tale ever told. The real soul of Ys Origin is in smashing 50-foot bosses using your trusty adolescent girl with a giant axe and conveniently-placed magical artifacts. With 3 playable characters (and you'll probably want to play through the game with each) and a more than ten-hour campaign, Ys Origin gives you a lot of bang for your buck. Or, rather, a lot of slash, smash, and pew-pew for your buck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid action RPG fun, 3 different characters to play with each with their own unique fighting styles and storys, each path takes around 8 hours.Game difficulty is medium, with boss fights being a particular difficulty spike.  However they each have their weaknesses and are quite fun to fight.This game plays similarly to Ys: The Oath in Felghana, however both of these games play very differently to the two Ys: Chronicles games.

The gameplay is simple and fun to get used to. My only complaint is that there isn't an in game graphics setting or control setting (at least not that I've found).

At several points, the game will not progress until you've found a specific item. This makes the chests feel less rewarding, since you were required to find them.			",52,8,1,9,1,0,2

												Ys Origin is an Japanese-style action RPG, set as a prequel to the Ys series. This is the first Ys game I've played, and I've definitely been enjoying it.The game's combat system is the best part of it: normal enemies don't give you much of a challenge because they're easily stun-locked (as Yunica, at least), but the boss battles are intense. The bosses are difficult and they take a while to bring down even if you know what you're doing, but their attacks are easily predicted. It does take some skill to get through it, though (on Normal). The game's story and world are also interesting; it has one of the better game stories I've seen recently.This game is definitely worth considering for any RPG fan, and I would recommend it even at full price to fans of the genre.

												An excellent action-RPG that can be a bit difficult to control while fighting, especially when fighting flying targets.  I honestly recommend playing this before Ys I, because even though it spoils an Ys I plot twist by its mere premise, it's a great way to learn about the world of Ys, and once you're done, you'll be ready to journey with Adol, where you'll remember important names and places, but you can see how much the world has changed in the 700 years since.

												Fast-paced Metroidvania beat-em-up dungeon crawler. Works great with a gamepad. Graphics are PS2-era but more than suffice, especially with the settings maxed. The MUSIC. Oh, the music. Most of the dungeon tunes are technical speed metal obviously performed entirely on synths. Nonetheless it fits perfectly. And that's the thing with Ys Origin. All of the pieces come together and make a surprisingly excellent package. Highly Recommended!!			",653,186,30,90,49,9,46

												Hack-n-slash game with RPG elements that offers enough challenge to keep gameplay interesting from start to finish.  Overall, it's a really solid title across the board, with the main highlights being the level design, boss fights, and soundtrack. As modern Ys games go, this is probably the best.As the name implies, this is a origin story that chronologically takes place before the rest of the games in the Ys series.  Ys Origin has three different playable characters, and each character has a distinct gameplay style and story path.			",189,37,0,26,9,4,41

												Although not quite as amazing as YS: Oath in Felghana, this is still an amazing game.  It has all the great action you'd expect, three characters that play differently, and a decent story.  The linearity of the design and toned-down difficulty (if you've beaten Oath on normal or above, you'll probably want to start with Hard here) are slightly disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed the many hours I spent playing this and highly recommend it.

Gameplay is mostly button mashing with some strategy. If you want to be a badass there are 2 higher difficulty settings. The graphics are a nice mix of 3D/2D and the soundtrack was never boring. If your a lore nerd Ys happens to be a long series, with games on the PS3, Vita, Ds...etc and anime.			",75,17,5,14,5,0,6

												It's the game Falcom made after Oath in Felghana. The combat system is even more polished, the boss battles even more crazy, the music even more fantastic (in places), and the player characters even more talkactive. While it lacks an overworld it doesn't skimp on providing an interesting and varied labyrinth to go through. If you haven't bought Oath in Felghana yet, you should. If you haven't, you'll find what I wrote above (in parts) easy to believe! Origin improves on the amazing gameplay of its predecessor, while adding more to be awed at! And it's a real PC exclusive game!As before, though, might be too hardcore for some. Graphics were good for their time, but aren't spectacular now. You don't need to care about the story.

I spent just about 17 hours on it but still was able to build my character up to Level 50.  The game is challenging on Normal difficulty, but I only felt that a couple of boss fights were somewhat unfair.  Goddess statues grant you further augmentation of your powers and armor.  Exploration is rewarded; if you're diligent, you'll find everything.  Highly recommended.			",287,49,0,39,2,0,6

												It's a pretty decent hack'n'slash ARPG, if that's all you're looking for, but it doesn't particularly stand out unless you're there for the Ys part of it. The combat is solid but doesn't have a ton of depth. The characters are likable but don't have a ton of depth. The story is your standard ""bad guys did something bad; now the good guys better do something about it"" fare, so it won't carry anything on its own (not to mention it only shows up for a few minutes of exposition every hour or so). It would be a fairly satisfying little timekiller that doesn't really stand out in any way except for one thing: a lot of the unlocks feel like they're on a free-to-play schedule in a non-free-to-play game.The higher tier upgrades in the story mode take an absurd amount of grinding to pay for. Can't beat a boss? Grind some levels, because a single level's worth of stats will make an enormous difference in the damage you deal/take. Two levels will change a fight from brutally hard to a pushover (although that's more ""return of the 90s"" than ""when free-to-play games attack""). There are a bunch of bonus game modes you can unlock and extra characters and alternate character versions with different attacks and all sorts of stuff like that, but they require beating the entire story mode so many times (and weirdly, most of the achievement requirements are also ""beat the game multiple times"") that I'm guessing at least 90% of people will never even see things like arena mode. I know I certainly won't, even though I'd try it out if it were available immediately after having beaten the game the first time. It makes Korean MMOs look like they're concerned that you don't get outside enough.Aside from that, it's fun enough, but I'd mostly only recommend it to people who want more backstory to the Ys games.

												Ys Origin, aka ""Wizard Supremacy"" aka ""The Melancholy of Yunica Tovah"" aka ""Super♥♥♥♥♥♥Boy"", is the first in the franchise to allot you a choice of characters with which to begin your adventure; you can even play as wizard, thus invalidating all the other choices. Set almost a millenium before Ys I, Origin poses many questions: what happened to the seas of water, lava, toxic blood and the entire desert stuck inside the Devil's Tower between games, and where could they ever possibly go? With his magical Gradius options, main character Hugo Fact is prepared to solve these mysteries with none of the usual conditions for success required of other lesser protagonists, such as being limited by range, having to follow a set attack progression and not just fill the screen with an endless torrent of projectiles that eventually causes the overwracked sound driver to start playing effects half a second late, and actually taking damage when hit.

												Ys Origin is an ARPG similar to games like Legend of Mana or Legacy of Goku. The game tells the story of two children(?) whom are traveling with their people to find their deities that seem to have gotten captured. You pick one of the two characters, each offering a ""unique"" story but ultimately the same main points are hit the same and you play through the exact same levels. What keeps this fresh is that the two characters offer a completely different play style, one is like a tank the other a mage (there's also a third one who plays like a berserker) so there's a little replayability. The stories are mildly interesting nothing ground breaking, it's pretty much every jrpg ever so you climb the tower, find bad guys, things aren't what they seem to be, etc. I'm being a little harsh on the story, many may like it far more than me but after playing games like The Walking Dead and Ni no Kuni it seems lacking in comparision. I reccomend this game to any ARPG lovers or JRPG fans in general.8/10			",205,45,3,15,10,3,22

												Beautiful JRPG. The characters and plot are interesting and engaging. The combat is subtly complex, and separates good gameplay from great gameplay. Beating the game with different main characters who have unique fighting styles and stories provides excellent replay-ability. Many levels of difficulty for those who want more or less challenge. Very solid game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game turned out to be a real diamond in the rough for me. Bought it years ago cheap in some sale. And thought i would play it just because it's in my library. Turned out this game is awesome!It's an action RPG, hack 'n' slash style. Combat is very fluid and responsive and more importantly fun. The story in the game is also very good, although it develops along slowly, so it wont rope you in that fast. But once it gets it's hooks in you it's too late. This is the first Ys game i bought and after completing it i had to buy Ys I & II Chronicles+, i want to know how the story continues, and i will get the other games aswell.The game is unique in that you have to play the game through 3 times to get the full story. There are 3 characters to play. Yunica, Hugo and Toal. Toal can only be played after you have completed the game with Yunica and Hugo, and rightfuly so as Toals playthrough contains the most story with couple plot twists even.This game also has a very high replayability. It wont get boring to play through it several times. And after you beat the game there is also time attack mode, boss rush and arena where you can compete for leaderboards. In arena you also get points you can use in a bonus shop to buy alternative characters to play through the story with.Big time bang for your buck!On story page it says this game has partial controller support. I played through it with controller, also tried keyboard both works fine, i just liked controler better. Even if all tutorial popups show keyboard keybinds.			",289,62,9,47,29,4,36

												A neat action/rpg that feels like a dungeon runner but with a good arcade feel to it. The story is good and differs based on which character you play as resulting in different endings. The boss fights are ok but once you figure out a rythm or pattern it is usually just a matter of time. music is good but there isn't too much so it tends to loop but it's still pretty good. 9/10			",159,3,0,13,6,0,1

												Ys is a very good game, with lots of action and decent difficulty. I found it hard during the first half, but mostly because my character didn't have a lvel high enough for the bosses. This forced me to grind more, which made the final part of the game very easy.			",63,20,1,17,2,0,6

												YS, always been a fan of YS ever since maybe 80s or 90s? Especially the soundtracks in the game are just great. Definitely one of the very best ARPG/JRPG in steam. Might take a bit of practice to play it with keyboard/mouse but its definitely do-able.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As an average player of platformer games, this game was hard for me to beat. I played as Yunica on normal difficulty and I died more times than I can count. The game itself is fairly liner, but that is to be expected because the setting is in a giant tower. The combat is solid and really fun. The keyboard and mouse controls are weird, but they work well in the game. If you use a controller then you will have no trouble playing this game too. This game is worth buying; just wait for it to go on sale for about $6. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not going to overly complicate this. This a fun, fast paced Action RPG that fits well into the general YS lore and story. I admit that some people may not have the paitence for it and the unskippable cutscenes may put some people off, but if you have the time to sit down and play through, My advice is put on some headphones, crank up the volume, and lose yourself in the awesome music and the simple yet generally fun combat of Ys. Even if you finish through one story and find yourself wanting for more, you still have two more characters and a lot of extra content to get through.This game becomes incredibly cheap when on sale, i personally got it for less than £5 and it definitely felt worth over double that.To summerise, If you have the time and like a good fast paced action RPG... GET THIS GAME			",33,1,0,7,6,0,13

												This is an old school classic that should not be missed. If you grew up on games like grandia, star ocean, secret of mana, and the like then this will be right up your ally. Eveything is here, the catchy (sometimes corny) nostolgic music, viceral combat the requires as much twitch based skill as it does stratergy, and of course a grand arcing (even if a bit cliche) story. And best yet? It's on sale!			",89,3,3,6,1,0,4

												In my opinion, this is the best Ys title currently available on Steam/PC.If you've played other Ys games, you know what to expect. Compared to the other titles, Origin is reasonably short (roughly 6 hours) but has 3 playable characters. Playing the game with all three characters does add a significant amount of replay value, as they play completely differently, and also have some unique story elements. Once you're done with the three main campaigns, there's also an arena mode for an extra challenge.As usual, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the controls are spot on.			",288,67,8,53,28,6,51

												Ys Origin! The game is amazing if only for its music. But the gameplay is awesome too! It is also different from other Ys games because you have mutliple characters with different stories. They go through the same locales, but they have very differenet playing styles and different cutscenes. It reminds me a bit of Sonic Adventure 2, where you have the Hero and Dark paths. The same basic mechanics are on both sides, but the story is different.Either way, it is a really fun game and has difficulty settings from the chill game player to the crazy gamer. It is on the upper escelon of action games that you probably didn't play.			",71,22,1,16,5,0,9

Great replay value, great story, great character developments, music, and gameplay. There's not much missing here if you're looking for a super solid action rpg. Definitely recommend this game and even worth playing through with all three characters for the extra story. You won't regret it.			",131,42,2,29,3,0,3

												A simple button mashing game, with a cliché storyline and corny dialogs, but fun and challenging gameplay, pretty good pacing and amazingly fluid controls. I really have no love for action RPGs in general, but enjoyed Ys Origin quite a bit, for its platforming parts and crazy boss fights. I even replayed it, which I never ever do with any game (even though, I did't find the replay value very high) and already got myself another Ys game. It has some charm that's hard to deny.
