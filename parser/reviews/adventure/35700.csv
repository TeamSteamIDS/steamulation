AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Trine Enchanted Edition Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: Platformer; Adventure; Puzzle; Coop; Beautiful Artwork   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-30 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTrine is a light game that is easy to digest but offers gripping visuals, a mystical atmosphere, and enticing gameplay.  All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution.  The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure. I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet.By far the best aspects of the game are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting. Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming. The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly. Trine easily has one of the most immersive 2D gameworlds I have encountered in video games.The gameplay is light and quick to grasp. Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level. But various difficulty levels and a ""hardcore"" mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge. And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining. Mixing elements of platforming, action, and puzzle solving with the unique identity of the game establishes an experience that is simultaneously familiar and novel— and irrefutably fun.The story is whimsical and fantastic; and the characters are pleasant and endearing. This synergizes well with the aforementioned atmosphere to establish an amusing fantasy experience. But it also remains light and relaxed, and never takes itself too seriously.  So even casual fans of fantasy will enjoy the narrative.Trine is definitely a worthy pick-up. No matter what your standard preferences are, you should give this game some consideration. Check it out.Addendum:  The game was upgraded to a better engine and to add online coop. The new cooperative mode adds an extra layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay is a joy to experience with friends.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Trine is a puzzle platformer with some action thrown in there. You have three characters that you can switch between on the fly, similar to the old Lost Vikings game. You first have the most useful class, the Thief that can use a grappling hook to wooden ledges, a bow, and a flaming bow to light torches. Then you have the wizard that can magically make boxes by clicking or holding the right trigger and draw a box. You can also draw platforms and click and drag specific things to move them or get them out of your way. You can use your boxes and platforms to crush enemies. These first two classes are a lot of fun and have a lot of depth, but then we get to the third class / character, the warrior. He is just your straight up sword swinger, effective melee character.... with a shield that seems pretty useless.The game is very beautiful, bright and vibrant. It is also very physics based and the physics feel nice. There are nice visuals with diverse settings and instead of cut scenes, the game just uses narrations as you play, which I greatly prefer. Since it is so visually beautiful, it can be a beast on lesser video cards, even at the lowest setting. Your platforms and boxes crush enemies, objects can be thrown into enemies or through destructible walls, the grappling hook lets you swing, and you can wrap hanging spike traps around platforms so they don't fall. I seemed to get the most fun out of unintentional things, such as teeter tauter platforms combine with Ferris wheel like platforms coupled with skeleton warriors jumping and sliding around to fill the room. The platforming dynamic of moving physics based platforming was a lot of fun.The controls are very simple, and a controller is highly recommended. You have a jump button, a change weapon button, a trigger for drawing boxes or a grappling hook, two shift character buttons, the left stick controls the character, the right stick is like an aim for the bow, to draw platforms and to aim your shield (which is useless when you can easily dodge attacks). You can aim the bow and the longer you aim it, the further the arrow goes. If you don't like switching between characters, you can also play with a friend, but it is sad there is no online co-op.Each character has their own health and mana bar, but the mana never really seems to run out with enemies constantly dropping potions. If one character dies, they're dead until you reach a checkpoint, even previous checkpoints. If all three characters die, then you simply restart at the last checkpoint. Its a forgiving system, which I'm happy about.As you progress through the game, you'll level up to get your choice of skill upgrades. You'll also find new tricks and skills.The enemies seem competent and dangerous enough. The basic enemy is the skeleton that comes in four flavors, standard, shielded, archer and pyro. They will jump over pits, climb, fall and do everything to get to you (except archers that stand and shoot). The enemy AI seems good enough so every situation can be different  There are also spiders and bats, but for the most part, that's it.It is a quick game, about 4 - 6 hours, but still a fun play through (not as addictively fun as Guacamelee). There is some replay value here with collecting stuff from each level and no playthrough feels exactly the same due to the physics and AI. It was a good design choice to have collectables stay collected when you enter each level so you don't waste time getting what you already had.If you can get it cheaper than $10, go for it. If you're not into puzzles, avoid it, because the combat is pretty shallow.			",1126,324,51,104,96,15,167

												My thoughts on Trine:Trine is a beautifully designed 2D action-jumping-fighting-puzzle solving indie game. You get to play three differennt characters at once - a knight, a thief and a wizard. While obviously only controlling one of them at a time, you can switch between those three at any time, using their individual strenghts and abilities to make it to the other side of the map.As the knight, you're armed with shield and sword and are capable of lifting heavy objects and throw them at your enemies. The shield can be used to block any incoming attack, while the sword is the perfect weapon to deal with the growing numbers of skeletons, bats, and other enemies that you'll encounter.The thief is armed with a bow and thus able to fight enemies from afar (duh), and can shoot a rope on wooden objects to swing across pits, pull herself out of them in case you still manage to fall and perform cool looking jumps.As the wizard, you can summon cubes or planks to make yourself an easy way across pits, build stairs to get over high cliffs or drop them on your enemies.Each ability and spell can be upgraded throughout the game, like letting you shoot several arrows at once, create more cubes to stack on each other or make your sword even deadlier. There are hundrets of casks granting you exp or mana hidden across the game and finding (and reaching!) them all is no easy task!The graphics are among the best I've seen on a 2D game, only behind this games successor Trine 2. A special praise goes to the awesome person who created this beautiful soundtrack, the music fits this game just perfectly. I personally didn't like all of the jumping parts that much, just because I'm usually not a big fan of jumping games (and suck at it too), and died several times over. I know I'm criticising a jumping game for its jumping parts, so someone who's into that kind of stuff will have a really good and challenging time with this game. For people like myself, it's still enjoyable, and swining around with the thief is fun, but after a while it can get boring. There could be more different enemies too, since in like the first three chapters or so all you fight are skeletons and bats. Lots of good things to be said and a few bad too, still I'd recommend anyone to buy this game, especially if it's on sale for like € 1,- or so.			",182,20,4,18,15,3,20

												Nobody really knows why this game is good. It's written down on a scroll somewhere. It's a platformer in an ocean of platformers. It's sweet and pretty, it's enough and not too much, it's easy on Normal and sometimes annoying on Normal, cos who enjoys falling to their death repeatedly? But that's the genre. Get into the swing of things using Thief; mow down skeletons using a bow with up to three arrows in one shot. If she's dead for some reason, choose the knight to mow down even more skeletons. If these classes fail, use the Wizard to get to the next checkpoint. You can even fly Aladdin-style using two conjured planks on top of one another, once you turn on levitation. Leviosaaa, baby!I haven't tried co-op  and I've yet to play the game on Hard mode, but I'm 4 achievements shy of 100%, so I felt comfortable enough to share my thoughts. Finland has some great developers, so I feel good about supporting them. I rate this game ""Ihan mahtava, peukalot pystyyn!""			",207,32,4,5,7,0,3

												I think we should have more of these games nowadays. Trine simply looks stunning! It successfully captures the atmosphere of a medieval fantasy world. To make it interesting we have 3 protagonists - a knight, a rogue and a wizard - but we can only use one at a time. And no, the wizard cannot conjure up lightning and summon creatures or throw fireballs at the approaching enemies. Amadeus can only create boxes, planks or triangles - objects with which you can proceed further ahead on each level.And this is where Trine shines: There are many puzzles and you need to think and find the solution. Occasionally, you can progress fast but on your way you notice you have left some collectibles behind. So, while completing the game does not necessarily take long you are apt to spend hours with the game just to make a 100% progress on each stage.Frozenbyte did a wonderful job when releasing this gem back in 2009. Instead of picking this one you should look for the complete edition which has its sequel, the DLC for the 2nd episode and the soundtrack included. Here in Hungary the retail version of the same bundle costs around 5 EUR and you can activate all the contents via Steam.You cannot go wrong with this one and as Trine is regularly discounted you can easily find it for a suitable price. Just make sure to grab it with a friend as the sequel includes co-op mode!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

Three's companyTrine is great fun in single-player and it's worth experimenting with the three-player co-op even if the game works best as a solo experience. Players are given a set of tools (three characters with unique abilities) and are presented with problems that can be solved in several ways, resulting in an adventure that feels wide open despite being relegated to a mere two dimensions. The beautiful visuals and sound bring this world to life and there is something new to discover around every corner. A lack of enemy variety, disappointing conclusion, and the wonky multiplayer keep Trine from greatness, but this is still a highly recommended puzzle platformer.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												Beautiful graphics, pleasant background music, decent amount of humour and comic mischief, item pickups, straightforward puzzles and arcade platformer.Achievements are reasonable and can be obtained singleplayer or co-op with 2/3 players. Published Steam community guides, online walkthrus and videos are available and all achievements can be obtained during normal playthrough of the game, after several attempts replaying a particular chapter as well as the option to replay each completed chapter on Hard difficulty.

												A beautiful blend of action, platforming, and puzzling Trine manages to offer lots of fun and even some challenge. There are also some RPG elements through level ups, skills, and hidden equipment. I will admit, the story wasn't very gripping and my friends and I would often just skip it, but the gameplay is top notch.Armed with a bow, the thief is the most agile of the three and you can use her grappling hook to traverse the environment. The knight is the traditional melee character and comes with a shield, sword, and a hammer. Probably the best character though, is the wizard. He can create boxes, planks and floating platforms, and he can also move them around. If that doesn't sound exciting, wait until your slinging boxes at all your enemies or throwing planks on your friends to make them fall into pits.When you aren't busy knocking each other off of cliffs or into fire or spikes, you will find that Trine is an extremely well made co-op game. Everyone character and player really has to work together to get through the game, and everyone fills a role. The thief's grappling hook is perfect for those hard to reach places and she is often the one retrieving experience potions, though she can hardly do it alone and the wizards platforms help immensely. The wizard is arguably the leader of the team because he is able to carry everyone on platforms, disable traps by obstructing them, and he can handles enemies fairly well with his objects. Admittedly, the knight seems to have the short end of the deal as he really only shines in combat; he can throw boxes and break walls, but there are very few cases outside of combat where he is absolutely necessary.Trine was the only local co-op game me and my friends would play for quite a while, it was just too good to put down. Now with the automatic update to Enchanted Edition, this game just got better. This game goes on sale often, and I buy it for friends whenever I can because this is a well made game and this is great developer. They worked tirelessly to completely update a 5 year old game that probably didn't rake in as much other less deserving games, and when they finished they just included it for every owner for free.You might find find a better action platformer, or a better puzzle platformer, but you probably won't find a game that blends the two together well and offers a terrific co-op experience.

												One of my favorite coop games ever but suffers from the fact that it is local coop only (something that Trine 2 ended up getting). The levels are very well designed overall allowing for a lot of solutions for the puzzles and obstacles in the game using the three hero's different abilities. The graphics are great for its time and the voice acting and music suits the game very well. Overall simply an awesome action puzzle platformer.A good selection of achievements with some really challenging stuff in there including a no-death run on the last level of the game on very hard. That took me a lot of blood, sweat and tears.Time to 100%: 13-15 hours			",942,372,36,86,96,14,164

												Trine Enchanted Edition is a brilliant 2.5D Jump'n'run game by Frostbyte. Part 1 of the series turns out very simple but still challenging.Trine - that's always nicely drawn fantastic screens. Real 3D sidescrolling jump'n'run action in a high atmospheric enviroment. 3 Players online coop gameplay. And lots of puzzles with special abilities of your 3 chooseable characters. The magician conjures metal boxes and platforms, the female thief shoots arrow and has a grapple hook, the knight uses his shield, the flaming sword and his jackhammer to burst walls. The best: you can play them altogether and switch between them during gameplay.To collect all magic vials and beat the game on hardmode you'll have some wonderful hours ...

												By this point you're perhaps already aware that Trine is a very visually stunning game, with some great artwork & lighting yet behind all of that lies a really challenging and fun platform puzzle game.The level designs are fairly basic to begin with an help introduce you to the 3 characters and their abilities without over complicating things. You have a Wizard (who can build blocks and platforms), a Thief who can swing and climb and a Warrior who can fight.You can only use one character at a time, but the game lets you switch between them easily enough so it's not hard to link abilities together. So, for example you could build a platform with the Wizard to setup an easy jump and climb with The Thief. It's that level of combination and thinking that makes Trine a fun game to play. It also helps that the designers have done a good job of scaling the difficulty at just about the right pace to keep the game challenging, but never boring or frustrating. The native 360 Controller support is a welcome feature too, and makes gameplay slightly more friendly.Further more the developers have kindly updated Trine with the engine from Trine 2, which is why it's now referred to as the 'Enchanted Edition'. The real bonus here is if you already owned Trine, it was updated free of charge. The only real negative could be the slightly wonky fighting mechanics, but that's none issue as the game isn't about the fighting or enemies. In short, Trine is a fun, well presented Platform Puzzle game that offers a good combination of problem solving, exploring and physic manipulation. Well worth a play.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

And trine really gets a lot lot better in coop. Ive had a blast playing  it through with 2 friends.

												An astonishingly beautiful ""sidescroller"" adventure, packed with action and high quality voice acting. One of the best purchases in Steam at the moment!You play simultaneously as Pontius the Knight, Amadeus the Wizard and Zoya the Thief, who accidentally got stuck together by a magical artefact called Trine. In an attempt to rid themselves from the spell and go their separate ways, this unlikely group of Heroes find themselves growing more and more into each other.If you are even remotely familiar with the concept of RPG games, you'll know immediately that these three guys should have completely different abilities which more or less complement each other, and that is more or less true. Some points passages of the game are far easier to be completed with one class than with other, and being allowed to freely switch the characters is what makes this game so dynamic and fun.""Simple"" is the keyword for this game: the gameplay is simple, the controls are simple, the character customization is simple (only 3 skills per character, and some few equipments), the story itself is simple and cliché, but the overall environment is charming, thanks to the absurdly beautiful graphics and the really well worked voice acting.The game is fairly easy. You can die as many times as you want, you'll always wrap back to the latest checkpoint. Unless you activate the ""hardcore"" mode (which disables the infinite respawn) you will face no challenge even in Hard Difficulty.The achievements are well done but following the rest, they are also too simple. I wish there would be some extra challenge there at least, but in only 10h I've finished my first run with all achievements.My only real critique to this game is that Pontius seem to be considerably underpowered, since Zoya can easily steal his spot most of the time. His shield is rarely needed, and often one doesn't even care to switch. Fastforwarding a bit, in Trine 2 they seem to have fixed that.The Linux port is perfect also.Definitely buy this game. No question. Trine and Trine 2 are a MUST in your library!			",176,110,1,20,21,1,21

												As my girlfriend and I played through Trine this weekend for the first time, our eye balls fell out of our head ""this is the prettiest platformer I have ever seen"" we exclaimed more than once. This game is hands down the best platformer I have played since Super Mario 3 and I play a lot of them. I could not recomend this game more, it is fluid. fun, easy to learn hard to master, it has replayability it is gorgeous and smart. The one thing I have to say in retrospect is Play Trine 1 before you play Trine 2, because I started Trine 2 yesterday and it is amazing, I actually was just stunned at how good it looked, proper stunned. I am devistated at the thought of finishing it and angered that there are not more platformers like this.Am I on FrozenBytes nuts right now? Like a god damned squirel I am.

												Trine really is a gem of a game, and goes to show that you don't need a massive budget to produce a piece of art. Best played, with a friend, Trine can also be played alone, and is almost as much fun solo.Featuring beautiful graphics, tight controls and relaxing, interesting gameplay, Trine sees you (and possibly a friend) take control of three characters, which must be switched between in order to complete levels, as each has their own set of skills. The physics also play their part in the puzzles, which are reasonably easy to get through.Highly recommended if you like platformers, co-op or are just looking to try something new.

Fantasy Threesome - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Platformers are a dime a dozen. They're everywhere. The market has been saturated since the NES days, back when sides weren't meant to be scrolled. But they made that jump. And once the floodgates were open and the money was there, the industry got hit. In this day and age, it takes a lot for a platformer to stand out from the crowd. Especially when you consider that it's the genre Nintendo almost monopolizes, with the exception of smaller franchises and indies.Super Mario is a powerhouse. And all of his Nintendo cronies run the platformer business. But that doesn't mean a billion smaller upstarts can't nibble away at the glory of a AAA publisher, putting out their own innovative or gorgeously styled games. Some might even outshine Nintendo at their own game.Trine is one of those games, managing to nail smart level design and chaotic multiplayer in a way Nintendo always tries to. Originally for PC and PS3 and later remasted as Trine: Enchanted Edition for PC, PS4, and Wii U.Trine is a game about boxes. Boxes and skeletons.A knight, a wizard, and a thief walk into a tomb. You've probably heard this one. They find a treasure. A couple hundred skeletons and boxes later, they all live happily ever after.That's the whole game.A clever physics-based puzzle platformer, Trine is simply gorgeous and a pleasure to play. Utilizing an interesting three-character system, you'll have to use the powers of different characters to advance through different portions of long, puzzle-filled levels. An agile thief, a powerful knight, and a wizard. He's not really powerful or agile. But he's a ♥♥♥♥ing wizard.Their different abilities are the key to making it through the game's tricky puzzles. And what makes the game so fascinating is the amount of thought put into making each level friendly toward each character. The thief uses a grappling hook to reach far off places, while the wizard can generate platforms to help reach the. The knight can't really do either, but he's by far the sturdiest of the trio and has the easiest time dispatching enemies. It's an interesting power dynamic.When playing by yourself, Trine is a pretty good platformer. You'll be mildly challenged. You'll need to figure out the best hero for each obstacle, and the proper series of powers to use to solve each. It's pretty easy, honestly. You just figure it out, switch to that character and go. But Trine's multiplayer mode is by far where the most potential is. Because suddenly, you can't just switch to the character you need. That character is somewhere else. And maybe that character isn't doing what you're saying. Maybe they have their own ideas on how to solve things.Trine's multiplayer is complimented by the level design, encouraging not just progression by creative progression. There's multiple solutions to each puzzle, and there's usually multiple paths. It all comes down to how competent your platforming and wizarding are.Those are really the only two skills needed for the game. Though it is fun, Trine does tend to stick to the same couple puzzles over and over. Variations on a theme, or making things slightly more complicated or dangerous. But never quite pushing the limits of what it's capable of. And I suppose it's better off that way, seeing as how some of these basic physics puzzles are hard enough to solve with an incompetent party of three.At the very least, Trine is gorgeous. It's impossible to deny that. The Enchanted Edition does offer some upgraded looks, but the original is still as beautiful today as itgreat was when it first launched. Complimented by a great soundtrack, Trine does a perfect job of really building and selling its world. I'm not even particularly a fan of the generic fantasy setting, but Trine pulls it off impeccably.Out of the millions of platformers out there, this one is pretty good. It's interesting, has a nice multiplayer gimmick. Some boxes, skeletons. Skeletons are great, everyone loves skeletons.Sometimes you just need to unwind with some boxes and skeletons, you know? And this is the perfect game for those moments.			",156,15,0,29,5,0,7

												Beautiful and stunning game! The graphics are amazing and it looks even better in 3D. It takes a bit of twerking to get the 3D how you want it, but it's absoulutely astonishing! But this game isn't just eye candy! I love how you need to switch between the characters, and combine their abilities to solve all the puzzles and collect the lute! And it isn't a one way linear game! Puzzles can be solved in so many different ways that it's truly amazing. You just can't get enough of this game, and if the free trial hadn't ended I don't think I could stop playing it. Truly captivating game!			",906,754,9,105,68,4,72

												Puzzle Platformer with the added gimmick that you change your character in order to deal with the circimstances you come across. A warrior who breaks stuff, a rogue who is agile and can shoot arrows, and a mage who can create boxes and move them around with his glowy hands. As much as I dislike platformers (largely because I am TERRIBLE at them), this one is alright. If you are into these sorts of games, then this might be worth taking a look at. :o			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												An extraordinarily fun game with a good combination of platforming, puzzle solving, action, and RPG elements. Oh, and don't forget the pretty graphics, enjoyable music, and humorous characters. I've read that if you download the ""Enchanted Trine"" BETA, the game looks better and plays better but, seriously, the game as it is doesn't seem to need any improvements. I've been playing for hours now and I feel no need to add the Enchanted. I give this game two thumbs up and I'm looking forwards to trying out Trine 2 as soon as I finish up 1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basic platforming plus good physics engine. I find this game enjoyable, and I know a game doesn't have to be full of new stuff for it to be fun, but it doesn't capture my imagination. The story is pretty much traditional claptrap with very heavily stereotyped and simple characters, and the biggest challenge in later levels is trying to platform while enemies repeatedly respawn in the same place, not very creative. The physics does make for some slightly different puzzles from the usual, but it's nothing that hasn't been done before.

												Trine is a side-scrolling action platform/puzzle game developed by Frozenbyte, originally released in 2009. A remake of Trine called Trine: Enchanted Edition was released. It ports the game to the Trine 2 engine and adds online multiplayer.The gameplay consists of controlling and switches between three different characters (a wizard, a thief, and a knight) to try to complete levels filled with enemies, lots of great puzzles and many secret treasures. There is also a experience system that is shared among all characters, and is incremented by acquiring bottles found throughout levels. Every 50 experience points, each character is given one point towards the purchase of upgrades to their abilities.After so many years this is still one of the best local/online co-op experiences I've seen. Due to the enhanced edition upgrade, the game still looks good (#1, #2) and sounds amazing, just listen to the soundtrack.			",318,96,8,33,15,3,25

-Quick Review-I have already reviewed Trine2, after the enchanted update was released I don't know how much different this review will be from my first review of Trine2. (I'll refrain from the temptation of copy pasting my old review, but definitely check out my trine2 review! )Trine Enchanted Edition is a 2D fantasy adventure RPG, where you can choose between three different characters whom all have different play styles. You can get through most of the levels and puzzles simply by playing as one character, or make it easier on yourself and switch characters.


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Trine and Trine Enchanted - Oh, how Enchanting of him! 

			Views: 130		

			Someday's Atratzu wishes he had fancy props, new software, or the equipment to do better special effects. But he does what he can with what he has.		

 -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  I don't want to give away too much about the story, because the story is what makes this game so great. Whenever I play this game I feel like I'm listening to a bed time story being red to me by my grandfather. It has a magical attraction too it, many times it's very over-the-top just like real fairy tales, but it's that approach that just makes a game like Trine, shine (rhyme intended).You play as Zoya the thief, Amadeus the wizard, and Pontius the stout errr knight; each one has a unique game play style, but I'll explain more about that later, these three hero's are joined together by the trine, and must save the kingdom!Game Play: As has been hinted above, you play as three characters: Zoya, Amadeus, and Pontious. Firstly, Zoya (thief) is the most agile character, you shoot arrows, grapple hook and swing your way around the game. Amadeus (wizard), being a wizard can conjure up boxes that can be dropped on enemies, or used to help get to high hard-to-reach-locations. Lastly, Pontius (knight) has always been used as my ""meat shield"", he has his own unique qualities but those don't reflect my play style very well. He uses a sword and shield and a hammer; while he doesn't help for puzzle solving very much, he is very useful for bashing enemies!Seeing as how the game is 2D, it controls very simply, but I've always felt that the more simple the controls the more tight and enjoyable the game. You move right left and jump. You use the mouse buttons to shoot, attack, etc. When you start the game the game explains to you how to play it.An additional note is that thanks to the latest update the games graphics have been revamped! It now looks and feels like playing Trine2 on trine1, if you miss the old graphics or are curious about how the original trine looked like, just change the launcher to the classic trine and you can play the original game again)Another quick note about the enchanted edition: you can now play the game in multiplayer, which makes the game a whole lot more fun. I played with only one friend, but you can have 2 friends playing with you at once. Achievements: I have earned all the achievements in trine. After trying to get past hardcore mode on hard difficulty on trine2 I never thought I would get all the achievements on Trine, not for a long time anyway. after getting all the achievements aside from hardcore, I literally speed ran my way through hard mode and beat the game in one day. What that says to me, is that for those of you who want a really tough game experience, you might want pass on this game, for others who just casually play the game you're not going to get much out of it aside from a simple play through, for achievers this is a great game to increase your ""perfect games"" count +1.""What other types of achievements are there, oh derailed one?"" I'm glad you asked! Trine (and trine 2) have very straight forward achievement categories: Beat the game, Collect all the things on all the levels, do this with this character (different character challenges), and beat the game on the hardest difficulty.NOTE: there is one more note about the achievements, at the time that I'm writing this review (08/16/14) there were several bugs for achievements, I can't remember off the top of my head which ones were bugged for me, but you simply need to load the classic trine and play through that way instead of the enchanted edition. (I imagine these bugs will be fixed soon enough, but I wanted to note it)Price: Trine the Enchanted Edition is currently $14.99 I spent 13 hours playing the game, that's almost a dollar an hour, which according to my value system; is very good. I really liked that the graphics were updated, I don't grade a game based on their graphics I was enjoying the classic trine just as much as the enchanted edition, but the updated graphics really helps.  Conclusion: I rarely have very negative things to say about games that I play, I tend to enjoy games more then find them annoying. To quickly recap: I have always loved the Story in Trine. The gameplay is always smooth and enjoyable. The achievements were usually easy but enjoyable. the price was fair.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fantasy games, platformers, or 2D games.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update March 16, 2016: Added a link to my Trine YouTube Video Review!

OverviewTrine is the first iteration of the trilogy which bears the same name. It is a 2.5D action puzzle sidescroller with a focus on visual art and environmental atmosphere. The game features three characters - a wizard, a thief and a warrior - which have been magically bound together, and the player can switch between the three in an attempt to fight spawning skeletons and conjure objects to help getting to hard to reach areas of the map. The puzzles are minimal, so don't expect a brain-teaser, however the challenge to overcome obstacles and areas where good timing and reflexes are mandatory keep the game fun, especially in Co-Op mode.The Pros Beautiful Visuals - What makes this game really stand out from most side scrollers and platformers in general is the art style. The forced perspective turns this game into a 2.5D effectively, however the surrounding environments are actual 3D objects, and they are simply beautiful. Each level has its own assets, and everywhere you go you can see brightly colored backgrounds with beautiful, atmospheric lightning which at first glance will take away the focus from the gameplay just to admire it. The low resources needed to run this game also ensures a glorious 1080p60fps experience to accompany the already fancy graphics. Humorous Characters - Even though the game is not focused on its lore and backstory, the three characters have a     personality, and a funny one at that. Through the levels, you can hear them exchange some dialogue that will make you grin at least. Makes the gameplay seem much less fake. Replayability - The levels feature hidden treasure chests and XP bottles as well as a determined number of monsters you need to kill in order to fully complete it. It makes the player want to return to these levels and search for hidden areas. While at times you will struggle to find that one last missing XP bottle and get frustrated, it's still fun to go through the levels again, nonetheless. Skills and Inventory - As you progress through the story and gather XP and find hidden treasure chests, you will level up your characters and improve their abilities, as well as find items that you can distribute as you wish among the three protagonists to boost their stats. Adds a certain degree of strategy as you build your characters and makes spending some extra time in uncovering those secret areas worth-while. Co-Op Mode - You can play this game in co-op with up to two other friends, each controlling one character or anyone can play with anything. Makes the game both more fun and more easy(depending on your friends).The Cons Not Challenging Enough - the game, even on hard, is pretty easy to beat. If you are careful, even the Hardcore mode isn't too much of a challenge. Do not mistake this with the game being un-fun. It just doesn't represent a hard enough gameplay for those adventurous gamers. Unbalanced Characters - The thief, with multi-arrow shots and extreme maneuverability from the grappling hook is blatantly overpowered, and combined with the mage's ""Floating Platform"" skill makes it incredibly easy to just swing through the levels easily. The warrior is the most useless of all, except for very little occasions. Short Playthrough - Starting a new game as an experienced player and going through it again at a slow pace will take you about five hours. While a Co-Op wizard Floating-Platform + Thief Grapple style of soaring through the levels, ignoring XP and enemies could get you somewhere around two hours to complete. There are 17 levels in total, along with a boss fight that is more or less... missing. The boss level is just a ""Climb to the top of the tower before the lava reaches you"" minigame, albeit a bit hard and frustrating.ConclusionThis game is very fun while it lasts and the Co-Op revives it at times. I recommend this to platformer and action puzzle fans. Steam Achievements, Trading Cards and Cloud Saving, along with the fact that it is bundled with Trine 2 for a very cheap price at any sales are good selling points too, although the gameplay itself is enough to justify the purchase.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

Was it even possible?Just when you thought Trine 2 was pretty with a fantastic atmoshpere, you buy and play Trine!I haven't gotten far into the game, but it's fun and I like the character build better in this game.With an inventory, XP with requirements.This game also feels harder than Trine 2 did, even in normal mode, I'm referring to the enemies and that the ""way points"" doesn't reset your health as they do in Trine 2. The puzzles on the other hand are(as of yet) very easy compared to Trine 2.I urge you if you've played Trine 2 to give this game a try too.If you haven't tried neither of them, buy both!------------About 6 hours later I'm fin(n)ished with the game.As I wrote earlier I do think the character build was more fun in this version.Collecting artifacts and items for your characters, you couldn't ""reset"" the skills at your pleasure.I guess the ""kids"" complained it was ""too hard qq"" or something...The game was shorter than Trine 2, but felt more fluid, the story made more sense, however, as I also mentioned, the puzzles wasn't quite as challenging as in Trine 2, the parts where you had to ""figure out"" where and how you would get to places were more annoying than challenging.

												The graphics are beautiful.  The mechanics of the game are great as well along with the interaction between the characters. The game follows a fairy-tale storyline but it's not the story that makes this game, it's the game-play. The puzzles are decent and rewarding and many require the use of multiple characters. The characters are well-designed and well planned. Zoya, being the mobile/agile one. Amadeus being the magician further increasing the team's mobility or blocking some paths and what not and Pontius being the warrior with the shield that can block almost anything. Great game, worth playing for sure.			",1001,407,36,150,107,15,182

IntroTrine is a good looking game with great dialogue thoughout the game which are its best features. There are characters to choose from and a ton of collectables in the game.Good PointsThe grathics look great with bright colours and amazing visuals, Each level looks diffrent from the last so you wont get bored of the looks. Not as good as Trine 2 but still great.Controls for Thrine are simple and easy to remember, if you dont like using a keybored and mouse then you can use a controller since it has full controller support.Trine runs well, almost any computer will be able to run the game. If your still not sure then you can play the demo to make sure it runs alright.There is a bit of replay value, you can can play the game on hard mode or you can try and find all the secrets and get all of the achievements which arnt so hard. The achievements are easy to 100%.The dialogue and Narrators are great and fit in with the game perfectly. Some times they can moke you laugh and sometime they make you think.There is a co-op option which is great fun with a freind which makes the experience even better. I would recommend you play Trine  with a freind.Being able to choose from three diffrent characters is a great idea becasue you wont get bored of the gameplay since you can just swich to a diffrent character. Its very useful to solve puzzles.Bad PointsThe storyline is... Rubbish. Its a simple ""kill the bad guys to save the world from evil"" style which has been done so many times and they done nothing to spice it up. You end up not giving a damm half way though the game.I find the game to be easy, really easy. There are puzzles in every level but you end up solving them in seconds. The enemies are the same from biggining to end and since you level up, it becomes easy.The game time is short. You can complete it in about 5 hours if you dont collect or find secrets. If you want to find the secrets and take things slowly then it will take about 7 to 8 hours.OverallOverall I think Trine  is a good game which is fun to play with freinds. If you have played Trine 2 then be aware that its not as good. But its easy to move on to diffrent games. You will most likely end up forgetting about it once you have finished the game. I would recomment Trine  if you want to play it with a freind and if you like good looking games. I rate Trine 7 out of 10. ",116,9,1,8,13,0,3

												I love Trine!!! Now usually I'm not into being emo about games, but this one is great. The presentation is beautiful, a nice, colorful fantasy world with detailed graphics that   one just has to like by looking at, acompanied by a score that adds to the magic of this game. Of course there are some small glitches, caused by physics going rogue, though that doesn't happen to often to be annoying (just occasinally every now and then). Controls are straight forward, as is the gameplay. You'll be swingin, conjuring objects, smashing bones (the undead ones :P) and launching arrows in no time. OK, one has to admit that there not many enemy types, but this doesn't kill the fun. Overall, this is a must play!!!			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												This is a very original game. It has a platform gameplay that we all know but with things I had never seen in any game of this type.The gameplay It's primarily based on puzzles, how it works with physics is really interesting and innovative for games of this type, it is a challenging game and managed to leave me very frustrated at times (like some oldschool games could). I found very cool and unique the way you control 3 characters with different characteristics, but known to all RPG players, and using them to overcome obstacles, really innovative. The visual graphics are very well done and beautiful for a 2D game and the sound is also relaxing and enjoyable to listen when playing.Just missed a greater variety of enemies and more challenging ones. Anyway, I recommend!8/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Trine is a gorgeous 2D adventure game where you control one of three heroes at any time. The graphics in this game are stunning and the gameplay is a simple platform/puzzle game where each hero has different skills and abilities. The environments are varied and done with extreme detail. The music and sound in this game really adds to the fantasy feel of this game. If you enjoy 2D side scrolling games and wants to go for a short adventure (~6 hours to complete) I highly recommend Trine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While 2D action adventure games have all but disappeared from retail, the genre is very much alive on digital distribution platforms like PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and PC. Trine is the latest of these neo-classic games and it's an impressive, modernized take on the sort of effort that dominated through the 16-bit era. It does feel a little unfinished, as though the developers ran out of money or were pressured to get the game out the door. Still, Trine is a lot of fun and definitely worth playing. Gamers have control of three unique characters: a thief, a wizard, and a knight. Each has their own abilities they can use to traverse the game's environments and dispatch of enemies. The thief wields a bow and arrow and can grapple to wooden surfaces. The wizard can move objects with his mind and summon blocks or bridges. And the knight is the fighter of the group, best used for hacking through the undead army plaguing the world. The thief and knight give players the choice to use ranged or melee combat, and both can be equally effective. A typical example of the sort of puzzles the trio will encounter would be a seemingly impassable chasm -- the thief could use her grappling hook to swing across or the wizard could summon a plank and stroll to the other side. Most predicaments can be solved in multiple ways and you could make it though most of the game with just the thief or the wizard (the knight is really only useful in combat). There are instances, though, where you'll have to use multiple characters in tandem to proceed. The wizard might be able to get a hanging block swinging from side to side. The thief can then grapple to it, and the block's momentum will allow her to jump to a previously unreachable area. Our heroes' goal is to free themselves from the curse that has bound them together and rid the land of the usual evil that has consumed it. Along the way they'll solve puzzles, kill lots of skeletons, and earn experience points that can be spent to gain new skills. A lot of the green vials that contain precious experience points are hidden, so there are many secrets to be found for players that want to put in the effort. If you're playing Trine by yourself the three characters inhabit one body and you can switch between them on the fly. They each have independent health and magic meters, and if one perishes you'll have to get by with whoever's left until you reach the next checkpoint. The game can also be played by three people cooperatively, with each controlling one of our heroes, but this completely changes the experience. When playing by yourself, you only have to worry about getting one body past an obstacle. In multiplayer, each person needs to figure out how to get their character from point A to point B, making the game more difficult and stretching every little challenge out. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but other inconveniences get in the way of making multiplayer an optimal experience. The camera will let players wander off screen, for instance, where they can be killed by who knows what and that person will have to sit around until the other players find the next checkpoint. Trine is a physics-based puzzle platformer, meaning the game's objects and characters are governed by the laws of gravity and react realistically to each other and their environment. There are lots of subtle details and nuances to be seen here. Arrows can slip through cracks in wooden planks. The thief can aim her bow in 360 degrees, as can the knight with his shield. This allows for precision aiming with the thief, and requires you to direct your blocks with the knight. Man oh man, this is one good-looking game. Set in a medieval fantasy world, developer Frozenbyte has crafted dense, extravagant scenes that scroll by as you work through the adventure. Although players can only move on a 2D plane, the world is rendered in 3D and the camera will zoom in and out for cinematic effect. The renaissance music is also very well done, with catchy tunes arranged in a lush orchestral score. A narrator and the heroes are brought to life by talented voice actors. My favorite thing about Trine is that there is something new to discover around every corner. From beautiful vistas to interesting new game mechanics, the developers always seem to have another trick up their sleeve. There are just a couple aspects that seem phoned in. It could have used a greater variety of enemies, for one. Save for a few bats and spiders, you'll spend the entire game fighting skeletons. Spawn points warp skeleton after skeleton into the world, which always feels like a rather cheap and obnoxious mechanic. There are just two boss types that are reused multiple times: a giant skeleton, and some sort of beast with a turtle shell that is a pushover. Finally, your fight with the end boss will be quite anticlimactic, and there isn't much reason to return after you've completed the story.The Verdict:Trine is great fun in single-player and it's worth experimenting with the three-player co-op even if the game works best as a solo experience. Players are given a set of tools (three characters with unique abilities) and are presented with problems that can be solved in several ways, resulting in an adventure that feels wide open despite being relegated to a mere two dimensions. The beautiful visuals and sound bring this world to life and there is something new to discover around every corner. A lack of enemy variety, disappointing conclusion, and the wonky multiplayer keep Trine from greatness, but this is still a highly recommended puzzle platformer.			",218,63,8,25,14,3,18

												I have played Trine when it first came out, many years ago, and i was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. Now, after completing Trine 2 this summer, i have decided to play first one in Steam. And, boy, it looks old. Well, looks are still pretty, especially some places like the Iron Forge. But the physics are bad, comparing to the new one. I know it is not fair. But it was harder to control objects and control heroes in this one. Experience collecting achievements are easier in this one, but still there are some hidden in lava or acid or other invisible places bottles, which made me mad sometimes. And skeletons. I wish there were fewer of them. They usually do not pose any threat and you just have to stand and shoot them, one by one, one by one, hordes of skeletons on every level section. You can skip them, if you don't want to collect enemies experience and if you don't want to level up or get the achievements. Yes, so you have to stand and shoot (or smash with the knight). This just creates boredom in this unique game of physics puzzles. So it could be less dumb enemies and more puzzles, or maybe a few smarter enemies. But i'm still recommending this now a classic game of its genre.			",103,29,6,15,14,0,61

												Trine is the simple fairy tale of a knight, a thief, and a wizard that are bound together by a shared, but selfish, purpose that spirals in a classic battle against evil to save the world. Just like most fairy tales, it's light on character motivation and heavy on heroic deeds. And that focus serves it. Whether it's crouching behind a shield to advance through a jet of fire, flinging a grappling hook into a support beam above to swing across a pit, or levitating a huge stone fist to drop on an offending skeleton, it's all so satisfying and it flows so well. Every puzzle is integrated seamlessly as an obstacle blocking the way to the next part of the three's quest, an obstacle that can be dealt with in any variety of ways. The thief might be able to easily swing to the next platform, but the wizard might just as easily be able to pull that platform into his jumping range and the knight might be able to break through the debris that made the jump difficult in the first place. It's this interchangeability of usefulness but specialization of means that makes the consequences of failure so enjoyable. If a character dies that character can be brought back at the next checkpoint, but until then a set of tools has dropped off your belt and you're forced to overcome any obstacles on the way without them. It's never impossible to proceed, but in the absence of a preferred strategy, you're forced change your approach, forcing you to look at those puzzles and characters left in a different light. Sure, with flawless execution you can blaze through the entire game on a single set of tactics. It's only when you don't stick that landing or dodge that attack that this short, simple game really gets to show how well it's designed. And that's when you want a game to shine. Things can be beautiful and interesting when you're frolicking along, but when you're repeatedly falling on your face, that's when you appreciate clever, polished design.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Trine is a puzzle platformer indie game, similar to the Lost Vikings. You're going to progress through levels by solving puzzles, jumping from platform to platform and defeating the enemies standing in your way. There are 3 different characters, and you will have to switch between them, utilizing their different abilities and strengths to make it to the end. The nice art, beatiful soundtrack, funny narration and voice acting just add up to a very fun gameplay, making this game really enjoyable to play.If you enjoyed playing the Lost Vikings 20 years ago, or like fun puzzle/platformer games, this is a must!

												Bought this game on discount and worth every single piece of it even though you buy on normal price. You will play an adventure to complete each stage with some puzzle using 3 kind of heroes with their personal skills, so you need to maximize each character skills to continue your adventure. As you adventuring through each chapter, you will collect exp and item. You can also leveling your heroes skills. Overall, It has nice graphics and music. VERY RECOMMEDED!!!!

												Thanks for providing such a great game, as well as remaking it into Trine 2 Engine.Trine is a very impressive game to me. I saw it on a programme in a gaming TV channel at first. At that time, I was surprising that what a good idea to self co-op with 3 characters. Its story is good as well. It describes a great background with some cool and stylish paintings, music and most important: the great voice-over in British-style English. :D very good			",56,8,0,1,5,0,2

												I have played Trine when it first came out, many years ago, and i was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. Now, after completing Trine 2 this summer, i have decided to play first one in Steam. And, boy, it looks old. Well, looks are still pretty, especially some places like the Iron Forge. But the physics are bad, comparing to the new one. I know it is not fair. But it was harder to control objects and control heroes in this one. Experience collecting achievements are easier in this one, but still there are some hidden in lava or acid or other invisible places bottles, which made me mad sometimes. And skeletons. I wish there were fewer of them. They usually do not pose any threat and you just have to stand and shoot them, one by one, one by one, hordes of skeletons on every level section. You can skip them, if you don't want to collect enemies experience and if you don't want to level up or get the achievements. Yes, so you have to stand and shoot (or smash with the knight). This just creates boredom in this unique game of physics puzzles. So it could be less dumb enemies and more puzzles, or maybe a few smarter enemies. But i'm still recommending this now a classic game of its genre.			",103,29,6,15,14,0,61

This is a long review so if you just want a summary of why I recommend Trine skip to Results and read from there.Frozenbyte creates an epic story with the brilliant game Trine. Trine offers a side-scroller hack ‘n slash platformer game that combines puzzles with action packed adventures. Story:In a magical far away land the world is slowly falling apart as corruption spreads through the kingdom. Yet who will save the kingdom, but three mismatched fools who found themselves drawn to an artifact of power. A lustful wizard Amadeus, a greedy thief Zoya, and a gluttonous knight Pontius all become bound by the Trine. The Trine takes the heroes essences and combines them into one individual. In order to free themselves from the Trines bindings they must complete the quest and bring peace back to the land. Campaign:The campaign offers a great tutorial which starts off as you playing each of the characters as they find their way to the Trine. After you have got each character to the Trine the campaign truly begins. There are fifteen levels: Astral Academy, Academy Hallways, Wolvecote Catacombs, Dragon Graveyard, Crystal Caverns, Crypt of the Damned, Forsaken Dungeons, Throne of the Lost King, Fangle Forest, Shadowthorn Thicket, Ruins of the Perished, Heartland Mines, Branblestoke Village, Iron Forge, and Tower of Sarek. Each level includes puzzles, secrets, and numerous enemies. Some of the levels are incredibly long, although all the of levels have checkpoints spread throughout so even if you die you will only be set back a small bit. The campaign offers a lot of amazing features, but the best part is that how you complete the puzzles is up to you. Gameplay:The Trine allows you to play as three characters, but you can only operate one of them at a time; the Trine operates as a way to switch your characters. Amadeus, the Wizard, uses spells to conjure platforms and boxes which you can use to build structures, as weapons, or even as a shield. Zoya, the Thief, has a bow and a grappling hook giving her the benefit of range and agility. Pontius, the Knight, has a shield and sword which makes him a formidable tank. The levels are filled with puzzles and mysteries, but unlike most other puzzle games Trine allows you to choose how you complete the puzzle. Use Amadeus to activate switches, or maybe stand on it with Zoya and grappling hook before the door shuts. How you solve the puzzles and defeat the many foes ahead is up to you. I played the game and essentially never used Pontius, not that he is bad, but I preferred to play as Zoya and Amadeus. Results:If you love hack ‘n slash puzzle games then this is the adventure you have been awaiting. Trine is a fantastic game at an incredibly reasonable price. If you can get Trine on sale, even if the sale is only 10% off, you are getting one incredible deal. Trine offers character variation, brilliant dialogue, a wonderful ambience, a fantastic story, and gameplay that is almost impossible to find elsewhere. By combining Hack ‘n Slash, Plat former, Puzzle, and RPG Trine offers something that everyone would love. I would entirely recommend Trine and every second you don’t have it is just another second you will regret once you’ve got it.Pros:+Fantastic story, dialogue and storybook cut scenes. +Amazing level design, puzzles and secrets.+Awesome level up system that allows you to customize your heroes and equip them with items.+Great character depth, variation, and combination.+Beautiful ambience, music and scenery.Cons:-Getting each of the characters to full ability essentially requires 100% completion.-In rare instances I have had a glitch where my characters fell out of the map (this was not too much a problem as I would just switch to another character).

												Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 9/10SoundTrack: 9/10Overall: 9.25/10""I’ve said this before but I must reiterate: although I figured some downloadable games would eventually become good options for casual gamers, they would never be anything I’d purchase. But it didn’t take long for me to eat my words, as the likes of Wipeout HD, echochrome, Shatter, Flower, and even Magic Ball have all surprised me with their wonderful polish, extremely high fun factor and equally high level of playability and accessibility. Now, when I see a game like Trine pop up, I do question the $20 price tag and ask myself, “is it worth it?” Then, I remember the many great games I’ve downloaded off the PSN and immediately become encouraged; I went into this new title with that same optimism and once again, I wasn’t disappointed. For those of you who never played Trine on PC, I’m here to tell you it made the transition very well and without much of a stumble; it’s a beautifully designed side-scrolling action/adventure that will test your wits and your reflexes.Visually, this is one of the best-looking downloadable games you will ever see. In fact, artistically-speaking, it may be the best, although one could make solid arguments for Wipeout HD and Flower. This beautiful 2D world is alive with vibrant colors, gorgeous lines and environment depictions, and a very impressive level design. Each of the three characters look great as well; they’re nicely detailed and enjoy fluid animations, so Trine is definitely a joy to behold. The only drawback centers on the enemies, which are little more than generic skeletons and a few bats here and there. They don’t appear to be anywhere near as polished and accomplished and in all honesty, I never liked to see the skeletons show up because they’d instantly mar an otherwise pretty graphical presentation. Even the brief cut-scenes that only include still-frame photos look like paintings and blend nicely with the gameplay visuals. Really, I have every confidence you’ll smile when you see Trine.The sound is good, too, but I once again have to complain about the lack of a stellar soundtrack. The music fits the atmosphere, certainly, but it’s just not brought out enough during our adventure and it’s also far too repetitive, although you probably won’t notice. I say you won’t notice because the gameplay is guaranteed to keep your attention, but we’ll get to that in a moment. The effects are clear and accurate, although there’s a slight balance issue as the Thief’s grappling hook always seems louder and crisper than just about anything the Wizard can do with his magic. These minor complaints aside, the narrator is fantastic and adds to the fantastical, fairytale flavor, the voices for each character are good (although not heard often), and overall, there’s nothing to get into a twist about. Trine sounds almost as good as it looks, and that’s all you really need to know.At first, if you’re not familiar with the game, you won’t be too enthusiastic by what you first see when you start. You lead three separate characters in the same general direction and while you might correctly surmise that each section is a mini-tutorial of sorts, you might not realize that all three characters will be used at once when the trio comes together. This is the crux of the gameplay: there’s a Knight, Thief, and Wizard, and each character has his or her own special skills and abilities. The Knight has a sword and can easily deal with most enemies, and he can also cut ropes and pick up small objects. The Thief has a grappling hook (uber-helpful throughout) and a bow, which she can aim on the fly in a full 360 radius. The Wizard can use his magic to move objects around and he can even draw boxes in thin air and transform them into solid objects, which is another very useful skill. On the flip side, all three have the exact same platforming/jumping ability; they can all leap the same height and distance.Well, at least I think they can. I keep thinking the Thief is slightly more agile but I could be wrong. Anyway, each level, which is set up with an old-school, 2D side-scrolling format and you must find a way past the variety of obstacles, puzzles, and foes that lie in your path. The Thief can easily swing across a gap, provided there’s a piece of wood above that can act as an anchor for her grappling hook, or the Wizard can move a box for the Knight to leap atop of and clamber up to the other side. There are any number of ways you can tackle a certain problem, and switching between the characters is as easy as pressing the R1 button. Each character has his or her own health and magic bar so if you get nailed as the Knight, you might want to rely more on the bow of the Thief. The gameplay mechanics are excellent and because you aim the Knight’s shield exactly as you would the Thief’s bow (with the right analog), you can block in any direction. This adds some substance and depth to the battles.Of course, it’s not really about the combat. You will really only face two large boss-type enemies in the entire game, and neither prove to be much of a challenge for the worthy Knight. This is a bit of a downside, though, as are the spawning skeletons that can prove annoying and tiresome in certain areas. Furthermore, and speaking of those two bosses, I noticed some definite collision detection issues with the giant skeleton; whether or not his big sword actually hit me seemed random (even if I had my shield up).(...) If, on the other hand, you want a great adventure experience that makes you think and rewards you for your ingenuity and dedication, you’ve come to the right place. The levels are so ingeniously designed, you almost never do the same thing twice; the developers definitely take advantage of the three distinct skill sets available to the player. Best of all, it just never seems to get old…the progression is surprisingly addictive.Your goal will be to nab as many green experience potions as possible. The good news is that it doesn’t matter which of the three characters picks up an experience potion (unlike the health and magic potions; obviously, you’ll want to nab those with the characters that need them). The experience is distributed equally, which means everyone will basically level up at the same time. You will earn new abilities as you go – and enhance them with acquired points – and if you can nab some treasure chests, you’ll be able to equip some nifty accessories, too. In this way, combined with the relevant stats, there are role-playing elements sprinkled in with the side-scrolling adventure/platforming format, and it all gels together very, very well. Oh, and if you lose a character, he or she will automatically come back at the next checkpoint.Oddly enough, even though three players can team up and go through the adventure cooperatively, it’s actually more rewarding as a single-player experience. This is because that with three players, each one has to work past an obstacle without the help of any other character; so even though the Wizard can’t just swing around like the Thief, he still has to find his way across. This slows things down and makes the game a bit more tedious. Furthermore, I think it takes away from the hidden genius of the game: being able to switch between each of the three characters on the fly and have access to each skill set when attacking obstacles and puzzles is great. It's what makes this game so much fun to play; the options you have and the way your brain works when it considers all three. It’s too bad that the co-op isn’t quite as good but hey, at least the multiplayer option is there if you want to give it a go. But really, you gotta play it through by yourself, even if it’s not very long.(...)""Ben Dutka - psxextreme.com ",228,30,10,16,18,3,28

												Trine is a 2D action puzzle platformer. You take control of 3 different characters all with different abilities on your way to take down your enemies, avoid hazardous traps and collect treasures. The visuals are beautiful with vivid colours and the animations are satisfying. There is nothing special about it's story, but it is enough to keep you going with a nice sense of storytelling. The soundtrack on the other hand is gorgeous with various orchestral tracks arranged by Ari Pulkkinen and it really fits the game. With it's visuals, soundtrack and gameplay combined, Trine offers around 9 hours of pure fun and even more for the completionists. It's a must buy for every action puzzle platformer lover over there!			",157,55,0,40,22,1,38

												This franchise is my favorite side scroller franchise I have yet played. Now, let it be know that I am not an established or seasoned gamer. However, I am a huge fantasy lover and so for me this game is a win on a level that transends simply gameplay. Now to start, the gameplay is excellent. Each of the three characters are perfect manifestations of the stereotypical types of classic fantasy. This game is an excellent romp of fantasy. The archery, magic, swinging, melee, and just about every other feature of the three characters is well thought out and impressively executed. The narrative is perfectly balanced between not actually being too imporant that it takes itself too seriously, but also adding an excellent layer of culture to the game world. The soundtrack as well is quite exceptional and really adds to the atmosphere.Though at the end of the day it just comes to the fact the gameplay is just undeniably solid.End.			",85,15,1,4,7,0,14

												In a world of games filled with Actions, Colors, and generally noise. Specially in a world itself filled with noise and busyness outside of video games. I think Trine fits beautifuly to fill an abandoned and necessarily needed gap.It is a simple game, so simple in fact I can even recommend it to the young ones. The puzzles are simple but not lame, the artistic style is incredible, voice acting though scarcley there is well done, sound effects are top notch. It's really hard to believe the effort put into this game despite it's nature. The attention to details is in every corner. Every technical aspect is top notch.I didn't play CO-OP so I can't speak about that though.The main thing is, I found it really fun to just play a simple game that let's you relax. Still, not simple enough that it's poorly excuted. This is a game every gamer should play to relax from his/her typical competitive online or dynamic rich single player game. Already have the 2nd installment in my library, and WILL get the 3rd one too.			",22,1,1,2,1,1,2

												Trine is an absolutely incredible game. In this review, I will list the many things I loved about it and the few things I disliked. Pros:1) The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. They're extremely colorful  and detailed.2) The abilities of the characters are well thought out, and you are rewarded for looking for chests.3) The mechanics of the three characters work very well together. Near the end of the game, I was finding myself subconsciously switching from one character to another.Cons:1) The characters would occasionally glitch out, especially while using the Theif's grapple.2) Enemies were not developed well. Much of the time, a skeleton trying to attack me would begin running and swinging at a wall. Took away from the immersion and flow of gameplay.3) Bosses were not made well. [SPOILER ALERT] I had to face the same two bosses twice. I defeated the first one, then the second one, then I had to face the first one again, and the second one again. These were the only bosses (excluding the final boss). Also, as I was fighting with them, they glitched out. The second/fourth boss froze during battle and let me kill him.4) The story of the game was short and undeveloped. I'm still rather confused about the plot of the game. If most games create a story and base the game off the story, it seems like Trine made the game and then wrote the story afterwards. I would've liked more character development/attatchment. As well, the story itself didn't last long. I beat the game in 6.9 hours, which included me gathering nearly every experience bottle and chest in every map.5) The end of the game was not satisfying whatsoever. [SPOILER ALERT] The final boss isn't a fight. You must climb through a level rapidly, fighting skeletons and destroying objects dropped on you with the boss. In the end, you climb onto a platform with the 3 artifacts, and you win. Then, during a cutscene, the ""boss"" tries to attack the theif, and gets crushed in one hit by the Knight's hammer. This wasn't satisfying at all, the battle was intense enough but the end left me feeling cheated out of something, like I still needed to finish the battle.All-in-all, this game would be absolutely astounding if the developers were more thorough. Whether this was due to a low budget, time limitations, or lazy development, the game felt incomplete. I recommend buying this game and playing it if you're looking for some fun. I hope the next two games will be better developed, and if you plan on playing those, I highly suggest playing this first to get even a vague idea of what the story is about.			",28,1,0,0,2,0,0

												Trine is a great 2D adventure game. The 3-characters mechanics that you can get out of this simple game are amazingly deep, and you will have a lot of fun flying around with the wizard, shooting arrows with the thief, and smashing enemies with the warrior. Voice acting is spot-on, the graphical style is immense... you won't regret it!			",97,60,0,9,5,1,8

												Trine is a fun physics-based puzzle/platformer featuring 3 main characters, each with unique abilities: the Knight is your typical close combat brawler; the Thief fights at long range with a bow and can utilize a grappling hook; and the Wizard can create and manipulate different types of objects. The characters (which can be swapped at will) each have their own unique way of tackling the levels, which makes for lots of variety in how the game can be played. Gameplay takes place on a 2D plane, but the environments are all rendered (gorgeously, I might add) in full 3D. The story is fairly generic, but the voice acting is decent. Combat is done well and is pretty fun, but unfortunately gets old pretty quickly - you'll be fighting the same few enemies over and over again throughout the whole game. The issue isn't a deal-breaker by any means.. it's just a tad disappointing. All in all, Trine is a really well done game which I fully recommend for 2D platforming fans.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												I'm sure this is going to get downvoted by diehard fanboys of this series, but really. The graphics are nice, yes. The music's decent. There's a good premise for a game here. So why is it /so bloody boring/? There's very little variation in the levels here, aside from one or two notable exceptions most every level plays the same. Even then the only notable departure is the last level, which is instead just flat-out flawed. The game focuses far too much on its combat system and too little on platforming or creative puzzle design. There's about three different types of enemies throughout the entire game, and they're all over the place in each level. So fighting them gets... really boring, really fast. Though the bats never stop being annoying. Ever. The puzzle design is mostly physics-based and can also be entirely broken, basically defeating the point. I have plenty of fun playing as the thief and doing neat platformery stuff, but that's fairly limited throughout the game... I kind of wish the game was based more around that mechanic than the combat or physics puzzles, really. But as it stands the game just felt like it dragged on forever to me despite not even having that massive of a play time to it overall. Not going to say it's outright terrible but it's not particularly impressive either.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												Released in 2009, Trine made quite the impact among the players, and then again in 2014 when Frozenbyte released the Enchanted Edition, a remake of the original using a new engine.The peaceful kingdom is at jeopardy, the king is dead, and an army of evil and somehow cute skeletons and other creatures rise from the depths. All hope seems lost until our heroes arrive. A mysterious thief named Zoya, Amadeus the wizard, and our chubby knight Pontius. All brought together by the distant memories of the Trine, perhaps the only chance to save the kingdom, and all its people. Trine is a side-scrolling game full of action and puzzles waiting to be solved. Thanks to each characters special ability, going through each level will require imagination. But don’t worry, planning something actually works with Trine, and maybe that’s what players really admire the most. Creating your way throw-out the 16 levels won’t be much different every time you play, but the beautiful graphics will help. If we all have to agree on something, is that Trine looks astonishing,  with bright or dark colours, it’s all out there, to make you enjoy each level as a whole, and creating an atmosphere for the player. It’s a magical world, filled with exotic places, from dungeons to mythical forests, trough castles of bright and dangerous lights, to hidden villages with unspoken dangers, there’s fun for all the family. The gameplay is quite intuitive, even for youngsters, which makes Trine the perfect family game. But don’t worry, the developers were nice enough to place some really hidden objects that will make you think and replace your steps with each of our three warriors. Levitate or create objects, fight your way out with the sword, hook any wood surface and swing with style, there are plenty to go around when comes to play styles. The player can only use one character at the time, but change it at any point in the game. Make use of their skills, and improve them using a simple and minimalist (but good) menu, together with a nice inventory where you can place the items you want a certain hero to use. There are several game modes, from the standard easy, to hardcore where your skills are tested, and maybe even your patience! Now that we mentioned testing, why not test the original Trine? It’s included in this Enchanted Edition!Trine is a unique experience, doesn’t matter how many games you’ve played, Trine is unique, unique to its magical bright colours, fun gameplay, and even a nice narrative that will keep you focused on the story-line.A solid 9, and a must to your collection!

Fairytale graphics in a telling storyThis is quite a good game, still very playable in 2014 considering its age (it was first released in 2009). It's not a classic sidescroller-platformer, more like an 2.5D platform game with moderately difficult puzzels incorporating jumping and some nice, quite modern feeling physics.You play as one of three members of a party (a Wizard, a Knight and a Thief), and the nice touch is that you can switch between these three at any given time. This is often necessary to solve a puzzle or to make further progresss in the game, which means that once a party member is killed, chances are there you have to go back to the last savepoint. Thankfully, these are plenty enough to keep things agreeable - mind you, not quick save in this one. A bit surprisingly, difficulty seems to diminish once the game gets going - after level 5 or so (from the 15). Since by then you have far more abilities and more powelfull weapons, it gets easier to bruise through the levels. That's not a real problem, since each new level presents an different set of colours and atmosphere, but it is somehow surprising.The department where Trine really shines, is its visuals. Not that there are really fancifull effects, it's just that the atmosphere of the different levels is captured to perfection. There is something fairytale-like about Trine, which is really enthralling and keeps one playing for a while.And since the Enchanted Edition was relased, visuals have even been improved by more than a notch. Alas, the story really is not so entertaining, so after a bunch of levels you could lose intesest. Physics are great and enhanch the puzzels to a considerable effect, since you often have to resort to them.Still: recommended for those who love a game with real atmosphere and good albeit rather simple game mechanics.Gameplay: 22/30Graphics: 15/20Sound: 7/10 (nothing spectacular here, but the music really is fine)Stability/patching: 18/20Long-lasting appeal/replayability: 12/20 (there is local co-op)Overall: 74/100			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												""Man's greatness lies in the power of thought.""Trine represents a very good 2-D jump & run adventure game with interesting puzzles and three unique characters, each of them with their individual skills and specialties. You can switch on the fly between them to solve the various puzzle sections in a way you see fit. This multitude of different ways to proceed through Trine is also its greatest strength.Next to the vibrant environment and great love for detail, the well-done physical effects are also noteworthy. The controls are good and simple, and the A.I. is competent enough to keep you on the edge.  Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different. Fun fact: Trine was originally started as a side-project by a senior programmer of Frozenbyte, while the rest of the team was working on another project. The other project ran into publisher and funding problems however, and the team decided to focus their efforts instead on developing Trine. --My rating system consists of five categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere -	Details-	Puzzles-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: A-RankDetails: S-Rank(When we are no longer able to change the situation – we are challenged to change ourselves.)Puzzles: S-Rank(You are always a student, never a master.

												When I decied to play this before the 2nd game I wasn't sure if this would be worth it, But I found out quickly that I was very wrong, The first game is just as stunning and amazing as the 2nd one, The setting is beautiful and levels interesting, Puzzles are simple most of the time but getting exp pots and finding chests is the real difficulty in this game. It makes you want to explore every inch of the level to make sure you didn't miss a single thing and I love that. This game has to be one of my favorite games I've played and I can't wait to finish it and continue playing Trine 2. :)			",63,10,0,14,5,0,5

												I did not expect being disappointed by a game with 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews.Am I the only one who noticed that there are only 4 types of enemies in the entire game? That the 1st and 2nd bosses are used several times throughout the game? That the game has no endboss despite being an action platformer? The ending is a complete joke. In addition, the tag 'puzzle' doesn't suit this game because the puzzles are either too easy or can be completely avoided in Singleplayer thanks to the thief's abilities. This game is boring because there is an obvious lack of variety. The classes are also really unbalanced. As a consequence some are more fun (Thief) than others (Knight). The knight's gameplay is based on smashing the same button to kill ennemies. Amazing. Later on you get upgrades which allow you to insta-kill ennemies, but beware: you will need 2 buttons! Playing with the Thief or Wizard makes the fights at least a bit more entertaining.I won't deny that the graphics are great, that the music is nice, that the story is better than for typical platformers, but none of these elements can make up for the lack of gameplay variety.

												Have you ever wanted to take on the role of three heroes working together to take down a common enemy in a fantasy world of magic and mystery? If so then you should play this platformer.First of all the game is amazingly fun to play, with three separate heroes under your control every puzzle and challenge thrown at you can be beaten in several different ways. The art of this game is phenomenal; the world itself is both beautiful and delightful with lots of interesting set pieces. The characters add to the enjoyment with their witty banter and an intertwining destiny pulling you forward.The story, although not overly deep or complex, is interesting and had me engrossed from the get go.This game is fun, gorgeous and has just the right amount of challenge. If you have even a passing interest in puzzle platformers you won’t regret buying it even at full price.Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

Although its story is purposedly simple, you will find that each character - the mage, the thief and the kinght - has a charm of its own and you will delight at how many different forms you can tackle the same problem with each of them.I have played both Trine and Trine: Enchanted Edition. I wholeheartedly recommend any of the versions, although Enchanted is way more prettier and has updated props (which makes easier to spot in some of the most confusing levels), besides a nifty hardcore mode.A must have for any platform lover!

One of the best platformers out there, I'd recommend to absolutely everyone.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

												Trine is an utterly brilliant side-scrolling platformer that has a healthy mix of problem-solving and fantasy action/adventure. The game is developed by a Finnish indie company called Frozenbyte, Inc. whose name should now be set in stone to the video game hall-of-fame. Trine essentially remasters a classic genre and provides a worthwhile investment for casual gamers. It features a beautifully detailed world, first-rate voice acting and a light plot that keeps you joyfully entertained. Every gamer should praise Trine as a unique edition to their catalog.

												Trine is another sidescroller with many puzzle and jump elements. You probably will not find very new elements in this game that havent been playable before. However even the game adds nothing new to the gaming world i was fascinated by the beautifully created scenaries. The story of the game is not very deep and you wont see cutscenes at all. The music is very atmospheric and a great addition to the scenary. The voices of the characters and narrator are suiting well and are available in different languages. (I played on German and English language settings.) Mostly i enjoyed the multiplayer mode where you can join or host a public or private game and team up with 2 other players. Its a nice way to get to know different people or have fun with your friends. You can plan a strategy to find your path and even different strategies might lead to success. The different abilities of the 3 charakters have their own strengths and weaknesses which you will get to find out very quickly. I purchased the game in a bundle package with Trine 2 for only 3,22 euros and gave it a try but even without the discount i have to say, Trine is definately worth its money.			",25,4,1,5,4,0,1

												A very polished game, visually and gameplay-wise.  Fun on many levels.  I gotta give this game a shout out because if you want to just have some nice casual co-op fun this is the game to play.  Each of the three characters has their own strenghts and weakensses, coupled with their ompletely different abilities.  I'd say that alone makes this game replayable because playing different characters forces you to approach each puzzle differently.  On top of that, most puzzles require teamwork so be prepared to discipline your mates.  All in all its a fun challenge, just make sure to grab some friends and beer!Oh and the same goes for Trine 2.  Both are amazing.			",100,10,0,13,10,0,11

												Trine was released in an era when the side-scroller was a lacking appearance on PC. It sports gorgeous backgrounds, funny puzzles (which can be solved, avoided and even completely exploited thanks to the 3 heroes' abilities) and at points witty dialogues, successfuly breaking the rhythm of slaying countless waves of monsters.The developer, Frozenbyte offers amazing support - Linux works, OS X works, full keyboard + mouse, XInput gamepad (Xbox controller), multiplayer and couch multiplayer (just plug in the controllers, with up to 2 buddies on the couch and hack and slash your way through the campaign). The game also supports stereoscopic 3D - and it's among the few games natively doing it, a true show-off, with its vivid colors and spectacular backgrounds on 3D TVs.A must have for Big Picture Mode, together with its sequel - Trine 2. Highly recommended!			",66,9,0,5,3,0,6

												When I first saw this game, which was on sale, I got stucked in front of my desktop screen: it was somehow... attractive.I saw its videos and I instantly loved it. -85%, it was very worth. Then, shall we start:Though I have never played RPG-platforms games like this one I've to say that it's awesome.  The art ist beautiful, the landscapes of the different levels are enjoyable. It's a perfect environment for the game. I've played the italian version so I don't know how are the english voices but the italian ones were pretty good so I guess the english' are as well. It was really the same as being told a story by a storyteller. And the music. OMG. It was so eargasmic. Such a pity it doesn't come along with the Enchaned Edition. Fortunately in Trine 2 it does and it's quite similar from what I listened.The game is a puzzle-kind that offers exploration to fulfill completely the levels. I'm a perfectionist, so I tried to collect every collectable that existed. In many levels I couldn't, so I'll try them again until I get all the potions and secrets. Some are hard to get and others to find.Then, I've to say that is rather short, in 7 hours I finished it (the 0.8 h it's due to my play in co-op) and well, the story isn't very immersive but still is beautiful. It's a cliched one and it has no cutscenes. And the ""final"" battle it was somehow dissapointing completing the level was harder than defeating the boss. In fact, the boss isn't beaten directly, in order to beat it we must go up and complet the level, which is kinda difficult, but still, a final boss-battle could have been really amazing.I should say that there were no bugs except a few ""bosses"" that got stucked, paralyzed. I don't know if it was due to the co-op, since I completed 80% of the game on online co-op with my brother, but still, they had a bug that made them got stucked sometimes. The AI is also interessant, they are able to jump as you are so they can get where you are in a few seconds! And in some levels there were many of them and combined with the level difficulty makes the game so freacking attractive. With some treasures, which I reccomend to search, find and get, the abilities of the three characters improve so much.I also reccomend to play it in co-op when someone with whom you can talk, sometimes was really funny when we both died in the same stupid way xD Ah, the levels that you complet on co-op are also completed in the Single Player, so be aware of it.That's all. Ah, another thing. There are two versions of the game, the Enhanced one and the Original. I played all the game with the Enhanced one, which has the same graphic engine as Trine 2. I opened the Original one a few minuts ago and I've to say I prefer the Enhanced, whose graphics are more... soft.Thanks for reading.			",39,16,0,11,8,0,2

												7.5/10 Interesting game, especially for couples who want to test their patience. Colours are vivid in both versions, but as for music, I find it repetitive.I really enjoyed playing it with my bf, so I would definitely recommend co-op play, even though I hated being (only) Knight sometimes. P.S. I think that Steam should correlate achievements with Steam level or something else of that matter, since we all like to see those levels up. :) In that case, I would be more dedicated to complete them all.

												Equal parts beautifully awesome and awesomely beautiful.One of my favorite things about this game is that unlike other puzzle-platformer type games, Trine's design philosophy seems to be more along the lines of ""give the player a selection of awesome tools with which to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles and then let them figure it out in what ever way they want"" as opposed to the more common puzzle-platformer design philosophy of ""let's see how needlessly complex we can make each successive puzzle and then playtest the heck out of it until we're sure there's only one needlessly complex way to solve each puzzle."" The replay value of this game is much better than games like Portal simply because you can play through it again and again with the mindset of ""let's see if I can solve this in some other way..."" I think this sums it up nicely: Play time in Trine: 109 hours. Play time in Portal: 18 hours.Oh, and did I mention they went back and added online co-op to this? Loads of fun with a friend or two.

												This game is tricky dicky.It is definitely worth a try. The game is a pretty decent Platformer/Puzzle/Action/RPG-ish game.And its glitches (when they do happen) are hilariousTaking place in a ruined and forsake able kingdom this enjoyable environmental/physics side-scroller/platformer sees the player take control of three characters simultaneously (a wizard, a knight and a rogue) in order to defeat the undead that have risen to take advantage of the instability that has resulted due to the death of the kingdoms beloved king - plunging the land into chaos.

												Have you ever wanted to take on the role of three heroes working together to take down a common enemy in a fantasy world of magic and mystery? If so then you should play this platformer.First of all the game is amazingly fun to play, with three separate heroes under your control every puzzle and challenge thrown at you can be beaten in several different ways. The art of this game is phenomenal; the world itself is both beautiful and delightful with lots of interesting set pieces. The characters add to the enjoyment with their witty banter and an intertwining destiny pulling you forward.The story, although not overly deep or complex, is interesting and had me engrossed from the get go.This game is fun, gorgeous and has just the right amount of challenge. If you have even a passing interest in puzzle platformers you won’t regret buying it even at full price.Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												A very polished game, visually and gameplay-wise.  Fun on many levels.  I gotta give this game a shout out because if you want to just have some nice casual co-op fun this is the game to play.  Each of the three characters has their own strenghts and weakensses, coupled with their ompletely different abilities.  I'd say that alone makes this game replayable because playing different characters forces you to approach each puzzle differently.  On top of that, most puzzles require teamwork so be prepared to discipline your mates.  All in all its a fun challenge, just make sure to grab some friends and beer!Oh and the same goes for Trine 2.  Both are amazing.			",100,10,0,13,10,0,11

												Cute, charming but incredibly frustrating at times. The visuals are great, the game looks like a fairy tale. Controls are fluid and responsive, although there are a few hiccups at times. The music is charming, but, unfortunately, quite repetitive. The puzzles aren't too hard, but what makes the game frustrating is the uselessness of the Wizard and the waaay to strong enemies. They are too hard to kill, in my opinion. And the worst part of the game is the last level, on which I died many more time than I admit to. Much too hard, and not rewarding at all. Overall, the game is worth forking 8 bucks, but if you're not really into puzzles and fairy tales, you'd better wait for a sale.			",152,15,7,19,9,3,20

												Trine is absolutely one of the most appealing games I have ever played! From it's gorgeous visuals, fantastic soundtrack, excellent narration, and fluent mechanics, it's no wonder this game was such a success!Trine focuses on the diversity of it's titular characters, and the level design of it's extremely well built maps. Each character has a unique role in the game, from the Knight, Wizard, and Thief - with each character being compatible with the other in terms of move sets, and combat. The games platforming works exceptionally well, and the puzzles (while not necessarily that difficult), provide enough thought and complexity to some of the maps level design thus creating entertainment and replayability in leaps and bounds!Now, while the game is incredibly fun playing solo, it should definitely be tackled cooperatively. Amusing antics and crazy combinations will put a smile on your face, and keep you coming back repeatedly! However, Trine doesn't boast ""online multiplayer"", but ""local co-op"". That being said, it is still an excellent title and definitely deserves a playthrough! In the end, Trine is well worth the asking price in terms of content, replayability, and quality!EDIT:Trine: Enhanced Edition is on the horizon! This update brings much needed online multiplayer, graphical enhancements, and many bug fixes! Kudos to the developers for reviving an old game - and for free no less!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine is a rare gem of a game. Combining platforming with puzzling and setting it in a beautiful fantasy world. It's a 2D platfomer where you can either play with friends in 3 player co-op or alone. You have a choice of 3 fairly unique characters that have their own set of skills that can also be leveled up, more on that later. There is the Pontius the knight who wields a sword and shield, who is probably the best character to use when fighting off the hordes of undead. Then there's Zoya the thief who has a bow and arrow, which can be used to both kill undead or shoot switches and buttons. Finally we have Amadeus the wizard who can conjure up boxes and platform and levitate them, alongside several other objects in the game. This trio of heroes are what you are given in order to solve puzzles and progress through the game. You can also level up these characters as you make your way through the story. Collecting experience orbs which will eventually grant you with a level up upon reaching 50 orbs, which grants you 1 point for use on a skill. Save the points up and you can afford my expensive, more valuable skills. The range from things like the knight's sword to set ablaze to things like Zoya being able to fire ice arrows or the wizard picking up and throwing enemies. Graphically the game looks fantastic. Beautifully detailled backgrounds, which lovingly sets the scene and along with the music that nicely sets the atmosphere.In my opinion it's a lot more fun to play with friends than by yourself. But overall a fantastic game that does so many things right and brings back memories of the classic platforming games of old. Worth a look if you want something co-op  that's enjoyable and somewhat nostalgic. Good Day!			",292,75,3,32,18,0,15

												Highly recomend it as one of the best platformers out there.The physics, graphics (and visual style) and a unique mechanic for switching the main character provides you a really great 5 hours of gameplay.Also, multiplayer adds a really nice option to play all the characters at once and enhances the puzzles, making you work as a team, not as a multitool.Too bad it's not really comfortable to play multiplayer on PC since there is no online co-op.

												Trine turned out to be rather fun. Probably more fun in co-op mode but the game still works fine in single player.The basic story in Trine is that one night, Zoya the thief, Amadeus the Wizard, and Pontius the knight, touch a magical object known as the trine at the same time, thus disappearing from the Astral Academy. Zoya was there to scavenge for treasures as the Academy had recently been evacuated due to the incoming undead army. Adameus stayed behind to work  on potions, and Pontius had only just arrived, convinced he was supposed to protect the academy. Binded by the trine, the trio work together and adventure through forests, tombs, catacombs, castles, to try and find the artifacts that would break the spell.As a sidescrolling 3D game it has a remarkable attention to detail. The backgrounds are filled with art pieces and the levels are designed rather well, never being repetitive in style or layout. The enemies are repetitive though, aside from the few bosses. The gameplay consists of using each of the characters special abilities to get past blocks in the path, etc.Anyway, I really liked it.9/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												An excellent game with a wonderful atmosphere and a really relaxing soundtrack.You play three characters, all of them unique and with their own strengths and weaknesses, between which you can switch at will. There's also a small skill-tree to explore: each character has three skills, each of which can be upgraded twice.During your travels through the levels you may find various ""secrets"" (items). They will be automatically assigned to one of your characters, though you can always switch the inventories around.The levels are pretty short and cleanly divided, so it's easy to ration your play time.For someone looking for a challenge this might be too easy, as I started playing on hardest difficulty right away and don't really think it's all that hard (supposedly there are more enemies and they hit harder, but the puzzles stay the same). But then there's also the hardcore mode, which I have yet to try out.The puzzles are pretty simple.I can recommend this to everyone who enjoys platformers and beautiful sceneries, adults and children (10+?*) alike.* there is no gore or anything and the game might also be okay for children younger than that, but I'd always rather be safe than sorry			",431,209,10,71,38,7,60

 Overview ""Trine is a side-scrolling action platform and puzzle video game"" - is what wiki says. Trine is a throwback to the best old 2D games, we used to have.First of all, I really like this game. It's the perfect combination of graphic and music to make you have a great week night playing an Indie game and enjoying it, solving puzzles and just laugh at how useless the Knight is. Second of all, as I said the music is great, even though it's repetitive, the alternance between the 'enemies are here' soundtrack and the 'I am just counjouring a box' soundtrack, makes it feel really comfortable.In the single player, you have to choose between 3 characters, that are all fused into one body through magic.Steam Achivements and level: There is a total of 33 achivements. Five achivements are for completion: Find all the secrets in every level, Complete the whole game, Complete Astral Academy - the tutorial, Colect all the experience in the game, Earn all the achivements in the game.There are the collecting achivements - where you have to colect all the experience points in all the levels including Astral Academy - the tutorial. And there are the special achivements, such as: complete a level with 25 character deaths, or kill five monsters with a singly physical object, stay underwater for almost 20 seconds and so on.The achivements aren't very hard, especially when you can play co-op, where if one of your team mates does the achivements, it automatically applies to you as well. The hardest one I thinks I earned was to finish the last level with no deaths and to play the entire game on hard difficulty. This achivement it not that hard, you just have to do a speed run through-out the whole levels, but the enemies are so annoying because there are so many, and you have to spend extra hours to complete it.All in all the achivements are 'makeable' and you can do them in less that 20 hours.My favorite achivement is the Winter Secrets - you have to find the Academic, Bony and Crystalline holiday secret gifts.The levels are chapters of a continuous story that gradually unfolds as each level is completed. The levels become increasingly more challenging as the game progresses.There are 14 levels, 15 if you include the Astral Academy.In Trine there are many hazards that are encountered and have to be overcome:Lava - blazing hot liquid lava.Toxic Water - the lethal poisonous water in some streams and lakes.Water - the underwater areas in some streams and lakes(here you can die if you dont have a charm for undefinite water breathing)Traps are dangerous and can inflict serious damage or even death if not negotiated with care:Enemies are often lurking near traps and should be looked out for.The Three Heroes : There is the mage/wizard : The Wizard has certain Abilities that will be useful to the Three Heroes, such as:- conjure certain magical objects into existence with his Conjuration ability;-  to magically move many things with his Levitation ability;In the beginning, you are given the power to conjour a box, into the word, but as the levels go further, so does this ability. The sizes can vary depending on what you counjour. The first upgrade for the mage is that now two boxes can exist in the world at the same time and the second upgrade is that four boxes can exist.As the game goes on, you find different perks and abilities for the characters, and the mage can now conjour planks.The first upgrade for the mage is that now two planks can exist in the world at the same time and the second upgrade is that four planks can exist. While trying to learn the elusive fireball spell, the Wizard has discovered the ability to conjure a triangle-shaped floating platform. This platform can carry weight, providing a stepping stone. The first upgrade is that the thief can attach her grappling hook to the floating platform, and the second upgrade is that the floating platform can be set on fire and will explode.The game has different objects and items, that can either improve health/mana or add extra upgrades to the wizard - such as extra planks or boxes.There is the thief : The Thief has certain Abilities that will be useful to the Three Heroes.The Thief is equiped with a grapple hook rope which she is able to use in many ingenious ways.You are an expert archer, able to kill from a distance, thus the bow ability. First upgrade is that the bow can shoot two arrows at once and the second ability is that now you can shoow three arrows at once.Next is the fire bow ability, where you can break objects and light them, such as torches - this ability really comes in handy when the level is pitch black and there's a pit just near the corner. For this one, the first upgrade is the fire damage that increases and the second upgrade is that you can now make some area damage with the exploding arrows if you miss the target. The final ability is that you can quickly charge your bow(you go faster). The first upgrade and se second are the same - you carge the bow faster and almost instantly.As the game goes on, you can find certain objects to make the thief either grow in health or use an amulet to revive without the checkpoint/level.There is the knight:  The Knight has certain Abilities that will be useful to the Three Heroes - though I think he is pretty useless, the only good thing is that he can fight enemies faster and has a shild to protect you from falling objects. I do think the moves slower than the other two characters, or I just dislike him so much.The Knight has a sword and a shield, and the first upgrade to this ability is that you have a better critical hit. The second upgrade is that you have a flaming sword, which is nice because the whole sword is on fire and it can also be used to ignote torches, just like the thief can.The next ability is the strenght. Here the first upgrade is to pick up objects - but it only works if you have energy so you can 'call the Gods'. The second upgrade is the inhuman speed that can either kill enemies or knock them back. It's a pretty cool lightning effect.The last perk is the hammer. You can use it if your mage is dead and you can't conjour boulders to destroy walls. The first upgrade is to unleash a secondary attack and deal massive damage and the second one is to perform the same attack with massive damage but while jumping from a ledge. Objects:  As I said, in Trine, there are many magical and ordinary Items that can be used throughout the levels.First of all there are the chests. 2/level - they contain special skills or unlocks the abilities for the characters, thus you have chests with artifacts or abillities. Secondly, the experience. Experience points are gained by collecting the special experience vials and also by killing enemies. These experience points count towards upgrading the abilities of the Three Heroes.Next, the inventory items. The majority has either healing powers or mana. Amulet of the Kings, Amulent of Energy Gain and so on. But there are a few that actually helps throughout the game, such as the Wolfgand Music Box - increses the number of boxes the wizard can conjour by two; The Gem of Ressurection - allows the character to ressurect once per level; The Scales of Fish - allows breathing under water - unlimited time and the Victor's Crown - allows the wizard to increse the number of planks by two.Final thoughs:I liked Trine. The storyline gradually unfolded throughout the game by the narrator. You discover new abilities and tend to have a liking over a character(I preffer the Thief) and you cand spend hours playing, because the game is worth it. I recommend it.In the past ages, three powerful artifacts were created, that had been used to balance all of the good and evil in the world - go find them and enjoy.			",81,18,4,7,7,0,4

												Great artwork with the game, it's really really well done. The game is in 2D which is not a problem and you have to travel from the point left to the right, while climing fighting monsters and solving puzzels.Pros:-Great environement!-Unique Story-Smooth controls-Archer charater well balancedCons:Wizard charater and Breserker (fighter) Charater not balanced at all.I was playing this game with some friend so one took the archer the other the wizard so I took the breserker and my charater is suppose to be the best fighter since it's hes speciality. Mouvement: Because the breseker cannot jump as high while doing parkours and puzzels and hes really heavy so to get him around he needs assitance on each levels. (wizard need to move him around) And trust me there is no other way.Combat: Sure your sword can bash into the skeletons quite easily but the wizards can easily block them with hes cubs and kill them drop cubs on him. So in combat your not that useful since there is also the archer shooting arrows behind to aid.Boss Fight: You do not damange the bosses (mini bosses so far) so you just block and jump around and hope to live an other day while the wizard tries to block him with hes cubs and the archer to kill him.Breserker: This charater is pretty much useless and destroy some of the trio coop gameplay because when you play the wizard you do 70% of the work the archer does 29% and the bresker does the last 1% because all you do is try to jump but it fails so you wait to be moved by the wiz, in combat you try to help but they other can handel it and in boss your kinda just here to watch. ---------------------------------------------------------Conclusion-------------------------------------Great game but unbalanced charaters in a trio coop so if you end up with the wrong charater you will be watching the others play.  I recomand to play this with a single friend not two.        75/100			",106,12,0,15,16,3,26

												Highly recomend it as one of the best platformers out there.The physics, graphics (and visual style) and a unique mechanic for switching the main character provides you a really great 5 hours of gameplay.Also, multiplayer adds a really nice option to play all the characters at once and enhances the puzzles, making you work as a team, not as a multitool.Too bad it's not really comfortable to play multiplayer on PC since there is no online co-op.

												Cute, charming but incredibly frustrating at times. The visuals are great, the game looks like a fairy tale. Controls are fluid and responsive, although there are a few hiccups at times. The music is charming, but, unfortunately, quite repetitive. The puzzles aren't too hard, but what makes the game frustrating is the uselessness of the Wizard and the waaay to strong enemies. They are too hard to kill, in my opinion. And the worst part of the game is the last level, on which I died many more time than I admit to. Much too hard, and not rewarding at all. Overall, the game is worth forking 8 bucks, but if you're not really into puzzles and fairy tales, you'd better wait for a sale.			",152,15,7,19,9,3,20

												Trine is a charming puzzle platformer with some light action elements. The artwork is gorgeous, the  soundtrack is great and the gameplay is fun. The Enchanted Edition is a port of the original game to the Trine 2 engine and the improved graphics still hold up surprisingly well.The game is rather reminiscent of Lost Vikings and puts you in control of three different characters with different abilities. Unlike in Lost Vikings, most of the puzzles in Trine are physics based. Unfortunately they all tend to be on the easy side. Especially late in the game you are given so many tools that pretty much any puzzle becomes trivial.The combat is rather casual too, and overall I found the game quite easy even on hard difficulty. The last two levels are significantly more challenging, though. At least you can switch difficulty on the fly, so this shouldn't be a major issue.Despite these minor faults Trine is a highly enjoyable game that's recommended to anyone who likes platformers.The good:- Beautiful art that still holds up quite well- Fun Lost Vikings inspired gameplay- Interesting fairytale story- Great soundtrackThe bad:- Big difficulty bump for the last two missions. The game is really easy even on hard before those two			",563,231,11,89,49,8,102

												This game was an unexpected pleasure. The best way I found to enjoy it is to not ask too much of it, and simply let it be the casual gameplay experience it was meant to be. I bought the game because the gameplay videos showed the characters moving slowly and gracefully, and that chill pacing was with me throughout my playthrough. Here's how it breaks down:The Good - Here is an excellent title if you are looking for some laid-back fun. The game's pacing was just fast enough to keep things interesting, but slow enough to give you the time to take in the visuals and play with the game's 2D physics. The story was present enough to give the game some direction, but was unconcerned with details and complexity just like a picture book (and with the 2D gameplay and rich backgrounds it certainly felt like a picture book sometimes). The character control was pretty tight, not perfect, but close enough that I didn't find myself frustrated trying to jump onto small ledges. All of these elements came together to make for a pleasant few hours. The Bad - My only real complaint is that I wish there was more content (and I am downloading Trine 2 as I write this review so hopefully that will help). I finished the whole thing in about five hours. I had no technical issues. My controller worked perfectly and the game looked excellent without stutter or other problems. The Verdict - This is not a flashy game. It is not tense or super-fast-paced. You will not feel the rush of victory or the crush of defeat, because it never feels like much is at stake. But if you play this game with the understanding that it is a casual experience, and you are okay with something a little simpler, then I think you will find this game a comfortable match.

												A friend of mine got me to buy the whole trilogy, so I'll review each of the three games on their respective pages.Visuals: The game is really pretty, I must say. The environments you travel through are beautiful almost the entire time. There are a few spots that look like generic corridors, but they are not very frequent.Music: The music is good, but the tracks are very short, meaning the music quickly becomes repetitive to the point of being annoying. You also can't turn it off completely, only lower its volume significantly, so once the music becomes annoying, you can't escape it.Story: The story is... alright... I guess... Not desperately interesting though. It feels more like an excuse plot than something that was given high priority.Combat: The combat is acceptable, has a nice flow to it, and there are multiple ways to approach it. However, the boss fights aren't particularly interesting. (There are also technically only two bosses. All subsequent ones are copy-pasted versions of them.)Platforming: This is what really brings the game down. The most important part of any platformer is to have good... well... platforming. This game does not. You frequently find yourself struggling against inconsistent collision boxes. The grappling hook helps, but it has restrictions on what angles you can shoot it in, and has a tendency to mess up the physics simulation occasionally.Other points of note: The final level increases the difficulty significantly. It's still manageable, but can easily get frustrating if you haven't yet gotten used to the awkward platforming.In conclusion: The game is acceptable, I guess... But not something I would recommend. The short music loops and frustrating platforming issues are the main things that bring it down. Most aspects of the game are kinda average, but the visuals are great. I can see how others would like the game, but I personally don't.(A quick note about the other games in the series: Trine 2 fixes most of the issues that this first game has, and is actually a pretty good game. Trine 3, on the other hand, has a couple of other issues that bring it down again.)			",31,6,0,5,4,0,1

												This review is for the game ''Trine'',a side-scrolling action platform and puzzle video game,developed by the video game company ''Frozenbyte'' and published by Nobilis(wordwide).It was released in July 3,2009 for Microsoft Windows and since then the game has been released for the PlayStation Network,Mac OS X and for Linux as well.Trine uses the Proprietary engine.PlotTrine takes place in a magical but destroyed kingdom.After a brief period of peace,the king died without leaving any heir.So the kingdom descented to anarchy.During this political instability an undead army appears and attacks the kingdom destroying everything that's on its path.After some time three heroes,unkown to each other,reach the Astral Academy,a magical institution,where they touch a magical object,later said to be the Trine,and their souls bind together.After that incident they search for a way to free themselves of that peculiar effect.The trio must eventually undergoe  an adventure searching for three artifacts that once reunited they could be free.Apparently the Trine is the artifact of souls and without it the other two(the artifact of the body and the artifact of the mind) created the undead making them responsible for all the chaos that polutes the kingdom.After finding them they face a last ultimate challenge where they combine the Trine with the two lost artifacts,unbinding their souls forever.The game ends with the storyteller informing us that the kingdom has been cleansed from the undead and the three proclaiming it as its heroes.CharactersYou take control of Zoya,the thief,Amadeus,the wizard,and Pontius,the knight.Each of them has special abilities.Zoya is the stealthy one of the group and uses her bow and arrow,making her an exceptional marksman.Amadeus uses the power of magic,allowing him to conjur objects(planks,cubes,pyramids) helping the team to overcome obstacles and reach remote areas with great ease.Last but not least Pontius uses his sword,shield and sledgehammer with great force,making him the group's main damage dealer.The player is supposed to combine the group's power together in order to accomplish difficult stunts and unlock the group's true prowess.RecapIncredible game,breathtaking graphics,with exceptional yet simple plot.Enjoyed every bit of it and i definetely recommend it.Edit Friday 4 July 2014Trines has been updated with extremely good looking visual customizations and now is called Trine the Enchanted edition.You should try it out,everybody can be a Beta participant thanks to Frozenbyte developers.P.S Support the developers.Frozenbyte thank you for this game.

												It's very difficult to know where to start. On one hand, I feel like putting some thoughts together regarding Trine is well overdue, whilst on the other hand, it's actually fairly daunting. Trine has appealed to me in more ways than I expected when I first sat down to play it, and even now, on my third or fourth playthrough, I still find myself swept away by the game's grandeur.Trine's outstanding visual aesthetics and compelling soundtrack are just the tip of the iceberg as solid gameplay and well implemented puzzles expose the game's true beauty.Full review with screenshots here: http://twolofbees.com/cheesetalks/trine.php ",315,129,2,23,29,5,58

												Personally I really can't recommend this game enough.The story, the setting, the graphics, the artdesign, the music, the sound effects, the voiceacting (even in german) and the level design are perfectly blended into a package of pure fun and excitement.Because you have three characters for play at once there are nearly always different ways of solving a problem. Sometimes you have to switch rapidly between the charakters to get one particular problem done. Some other time you can choose which way of progress suits you the most.I think this game is one of the best 2D (ok the graphics are 3D so I assume it's one of those modern called ""2.5D"" game-enignes) platformers you can get today though I must say I haven't played the second part yet and I hope it will be even better than this part of the series.There are demos available of both parts of the gage. Go on, download them, be stunned by the exellence of execution in this title and then buy it. It's worth every penny even more though it's on discount on nearly a regular basis.There is only one thing that annoys me a little and that is the impossibility to look up or down. There are a few spots, even in the earlier levels, where you simply fall to death and there is no glimpse of a warning. I've played games where at least you can move near the edge and the player character gives a sign wether it's possible to jump down a hole or not. Maybe this would be a nice addition to any future parts of the series. And jesus how I hope they'll do any.As there are really fair and nearly too much checkpoints throughout the levels this is only a minor flaw and doesn't diffuse gameplay flow too much but it could have been solved nicer the way I described above ... nonetheless ...... if you are a fan of 2D action platformers with puzzle elements you simply HAVE to buy this game.You most likely won't regret it !!!

												Trine is a game I can't recommend enough.  It's a physics platformer with a rather unique mechanic of 3 playable characters.  They are tied together by magic so you can switch between them at any time and use their abilities to make your way through the levels.  Puzzles are quite varied requiring a number of different strategies, especially if you want to collect all the experience orbs which can be quite difficult to reach.  All of the characters are well-balanced and necessary to proceed through the game.  The game is also very well-written and acted which is a welcome change from most platformers.Where Trine really shines though is the graphics.  The art in this game is absolutely stunning and it's amazing how well it runs even on older hardware.  It also makes use of nVidia PhysX for high quality physics simulation (nVidia hardware not required.)  The world and levels are very well designed and quite engrossing as well.The only thing this game is missing is coop, but that was added for the sequel which is just as awesome.  Play them both!  You won't regret it.			",862,200,24,72,69,9,114

												Trine is a game about three typical fantasy hero archetypes (the mage, the thief, and the knight) on a typical quest through typical locales to get (as typically) three artifacts. Along the way, you'll use typical weapons and fight typical enemies while solving typical puzzles and looking for typical secrets.Despite all this, Trine is fantastic. You play as one hero at a time, swapping on the fly, and they each play differently; the Thief has a grappling hook and a bow, the Knight is an excellent melee fighter and can lift and destroy heavy objects, and the Wizard can create and move platforms, crates, and the like.The game itself is beautiful, mostly thanks to stunning art and level design, and the soundtrack is excellent, fitting the game thematically and doing its part to add an overall sense of exploration. The gameplay is top-notch, although the platforming can be a bit floaty at times.The game is a decent length (6-8 hours or so) and never really overstayed its welcome, and finishes with a fantastic level that's much different from any previous one. Throughout the game, you'll level up your characters and find hidden items that you can equip to any of the three for stat and ability boosts.I really enjoyed my time with Trine and recommend it at almost any price, but I did have one gripe with it: the heroes are vastly varied, but unfortunately that applies to how fun they are, too. The Wizard is by far the least fun to play, although he's probably the most useful; the Knight I had the least amount of fun with, until I got a late-game upgrade that made him feel, at least, powerful; but I almost exclusively used the Thief, whose grappling hook and ranged weapon made her incredibly fun to play and almost made the other characters obsolete for platforming and most combat scenarios.That, however, is only a personal problem and completely subjective. Other people might find the Wizard to be the most fun, given his versatility, or the Knight, since he can throw rocks and smash skeletons to pieces in an instant.I wholeheartedly recommend Trine to anyone who enjoys solid platformers with a tiny bit of puzzling, fantasy themes, or beautiful scenery.Nine out of ten.

												What a beautiful game. If there are any people out there who have read my other reviews with any regularity, you know that I am not a fan of puzzle platformers. With early access and indie development being so accessible, the market is flooded with crappy 2D platformers and just the thought of them puts a sour taste in many peoples mouths.Trine enters the “2 1/2”D realm because the environment and models are all done in gorgeous 3D and it is only movement which is restricted to a flat plane. The gameplay actually surprised me because it focuses a good amount on combat, bringing in a sort of metroidvania feel without the exhaustive and often tedious backtracking. You can freely swap between one of three characters: a knight, thief and wizard. The knight is a go-to for combat while the thief covers mobility and the wizard... well he makes boxes. I found myself almost exclusively using the thief while only briefly swapping to the wizard to spawn in a box or plank. Meanwhile the knight sat around in limbo collecting dust between boss fights. It really felt like the characters were extremely balanced on paper but in practice the thief really is the main character, only needing the wizard to make some new platforms and the knight to smack around anything she can’t keep at bay with her bow.The good parts of Trine are really good, and while I feel that the characters aren’t balanced quite right this doesn’t take away from the writing, animation and overall quality this game brings to the table.

												Trine really reminds me of the good old day playing ""Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"" - beautiful graphic, wonderful music, awesome gameplay - although there are many differences between these two games.The physical setting of the game, well, I must admit the developer did a very excellent job. Rather than hack and slash, you can step on lesser enemies, swing yourself (by grappling hook) to crack them, or perform other stylish tricks to fight.Most of the puzzles can be solved by different characters with different methods. Well, let talk about the Wizard guy; he can create objects and throw them onto spikes, leting himself pass unharmed - which is pretty cool.Trine is one of the greatest games you can't miss on Steam, and you don't want to miss its soundtrack.

												Just finished Trine in the free-weekend.I wanted to play this game for a while, and I took advantage of this opportunity to finally try it out. I am not disappointed, but I'm not fully pleased either.TL;DR review = Beautiful looking game, impressive degree of immersion for the genre through graphics, sounds and writing. Gameplay mechanics are not terrible, but they are the weakest link in this game. Not a deal breaker though, game is worth a try.TL review:Gameplay: I know quick-time events are not a necessity for side-scrolling platformers, but when you have a rich 3d environment and heavy physics, they become important. Case in point, the grapling hook from the Thief seems often buggy (often goes through stuff you can jump on, breaks with no clear reason, etc), staying on platform edges or jumping on them can be more tricky than it should, and creating platforms with the wizard can prove difficult if there's the slightest denivalation in the terrain (boxes start to roll, etc). Combat is pretty repetitive and non-interesting, you don't have a lot of moves/attacks, and enemies have an attack animation that doesn't really land with the effect.One more thing; this might be an intended mechanic, or because of time and/or development constraints was not implentend: moving/dropping non-attached stuff with your wizard. It kind of feels like moving an object in editing software; physics are mostly there for the move part, but the drop part is just like dropping from a fixed point with no velocity, no matter what.GraphicsThis is where the game shines. It looks gorgeus. There's a heavy accent on colours and detail, a beautiful 3d environment with a fixed side-scrolling 2d camera. The style gives every setting the feeling of magic, especially the outdoor forest parts. It's also not extremely demanding, at least in the original version; I was able to run it with an acceptable framerate on an outdated low-end laptop, and it looked great. Enchanted Edition wasn't all that spec friendly :D. DesignStory - Not bad. It's sort of like a narrative that you knew as a child, a tale of heroes bound together, who overcome obstacles to reach individual goals, but find that their bond changes their perception, and seemingly work together for the greater good.Sounds - The music in this game is great. It fits perfectly with the story/writing, and with the adequate graphics behind it, it's conveying a sense of immersion. The sound effects and voice acting aren't bad either, but it's the music that truly shines.Levels - The levels are not too difficult, ergo this game is not too difficult. You may find it troublesome to get some achievements, but all in all it's pretty balanced, at last until the last level, which seems to jump the volume of difficulty to 150% (from 100% obviously...idk, I had no better analogy...). Again, it's not THAT difficult, it's just that the game progresses really smoothly in difficulty, not really increasing or decreasing by much, and at the last one, BOOM, it's like you switched from normal to hard (this game doesn't have a difficulty option, btw).ConclusionWell...what can I say, I enjoyed it, even though gameplay mechanics kind of frustrated me. I'll put some of that on my rig though, and considering I'm recommending this game, what I found problematic isn't that much of a problem.			",49,6,4,3,4,0,5

												An excellent addition to the Puzzle Platformer category. I've only palyed for about three hours, but I was immediately hooked on the game. The various characters are interesting and there is a strong sense of storytelling through gameplay. I enjoy listening to the dialogue between the characters as I run through the level. What I think is great about this game is that there are so many different ways to solve each problem, I find myself abusing the Wizard's ability to summon boxes to give myself an extra jump by jumping onto the box as it falls. There appear to be some balancing issues with the characters upgrades and items. My Wizard's inventory is chock full of energy related items and my poor Theif has but a poison potion. As I see it there is very little use for the Knight's lift/throw ability because the wizard can move items around more efficiently and as an attack it is much slower and weaker than his sword.Aside from that it's a wonderful game makes you think as you go careening through beautifully done levels trying to search for experience. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenging Puzzle Platformer and well done voiceovers.			",34,10,0,5,3,0,4

												Even on its own, Trine is a visual puzzle-platform delight, containing 15 levels (plus 1 bonus level) for you to journey through. If you remember the old console game ""The Lost Vikings"", then know that this is a slightly faster-paced version with more emphasis on combat, as well as beautiful backdrops to the various levels.The game has you play as 3 characters (wizard, thief, and knight) fused into one existence; during play, you can freely call in one of the three to handle fights or puzzles, while the other two hover in a mental limbo. Depending on your tastes, you may relish the idea that the game's puzzles are generally flexible, and let a player choose one of many ways to solve a puzzle. You can conjure planks as a wizard to reach a ledge, or simply grapple to the top as a thief. Even combat is up to you, fight head-on as a knight, at range as a thief, or use a wizard to conjure blocks that crush.Though the game has its downsides. The enemies are bland, with only a majority of skeletons and two other generic creatures. After a while, combat with them becomes a chore to check-off inbetween puzzles. The story is nice, but has little involvement with the gameplay, as the plot comes in verbal chunks during 3 sections: the loading screen; the level beginning; and the level end. The game itself is quite linear and straight-forward, with only small branches that lead to secret collectibles, that in turn upgrade the three heroes' abilities.However, note that this game has a Local Co-op option that I did not try.Overall, this game is more like an appetizer instead of a main course; it lets you get used to how the game mechanics work and tells you the backstory of Trine 2, and you could finish this in less than a day. If you strip away the distractions of plot and combat, Trine is purely a quick (though not without some thought) mildly-challenging puzzle game. Still, I heartily recommend this game as it is a brisk body-swapping romp through a scenic fantasy world. If you want this game, get it purely for its pretty puzzles.NOTE: Trine is packaged with Trine 2 in the packages ""Trine Complete"" and ""Frozenbyte Collection"" which may make your purchase more worthwhile, particularly during a Steam Sale.

												Played the game on hardest difficulty from start to finish. Interesting little game though the challenges don't get too much more interesting. Figuring out how to get chests and experience bottles seems to be the most puzzling part and I felt I cruised through the rest. The constant respawn at the checkpoints is nice, but takes away from the challenge of playing on hardest difficulty. The last level and the secret level were both slightly more exciting with a up down scroller as opposed to the typical left to right, but I feel it could of been added earlier. The whole (running against the clock) near the end as well also could of been utilizes more as it added intensity to the gameplay.Also, I feel there should of been more boss presence in the game. A couple LARGE minions that could be counted as 'mini bosses' perhaps, but nothing that really bosslike impacted me throughout the game once.I also have Trine 2 and look forward to playing it. I look forward to seeing how coop may differ from regular gameplay and what kind of advantages that would have. I would not rate this in my top games, and I DID get it on a sale for both Trine 1 and 2 on a 3 dollar deal... But I believe trine 1 is worth at least a 5 dollar purchase.Fun but not OVERLY exciting. I played a couple levels at a time and had to put it down.I would rate the game a 6.5/10 and would recommend for a younger audience, or people just wanting to burn casual time. Still fun, but not overly EXCITING.			",106,19,5,8,9,0,11

Besides the somewhat troublesome no-saving-until-stage-clear system, this game very ideal for gamers with a busy daily life, and could only spare 15-20 minutes everyday in gaming, but still reaps great amount of fun and satisfaction.This is not a hardcore Thinker's Game, but it's truly rewarding and when you sit back, Hmmmm for a minute, and BAM!, figuring out a solution to get to that last treasure chest or experience vial.Last but not the least, gameplay is fluid, control is brilliant, physics is logical and graphics is sheer eye candy.

												Trine brings platforming games to the front page. I feel like I'm going to say a lot of the same as what you'll read in other magazines.Its beautiful... its thoughtfully designed... though I won't say its challenging. Its easy just like a lot of games of our current day. When you have been gaming since the 1980s and things like ghosts and goblins I don't think anything is as challenging.It will keep your attention for some time as there are many different ways to get through the levels. It gives you options which is nice for this day and age. Its like a platformers deus ex when it comes to choice. Though generally you will find that the warrior is less played and that you spent most of your time either as the rogue or the wizard as they are the most playable. I feel like the warrior was just added in there so they could call the game trine.It may sound like I'm bashing the game a little but in the end I enjoyed it a lot. Probably the most through the achievement challenges and trying to beat the last level without taking any damage.If you buy it and you like platforming games you'll love it.			",235,23,10,28,12,0,34

												Trine is a very enjoyable side-scroller with interesting gameplay mechanics and gorgeous 3D-rendered environments. It has a generic fantasy story that pokes fun at itself and the 3 playable characters are well voiced and funny as they interact and clash with one another. The many levels are diverse and dense with hidden pickups/loot and physics puzzles that draw equally on all 3 characters' abilities, which keeps the gameplay dynamic.Maybe I could come up with something bad to say about this game if I really tried, but I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Highly recommended!			",355,83,0,30,14,0,15

												A great game for anyone that enjoys 16-bit era gameplay. If you enjoy classic platformer gameplay with more modern physics puzzles here-and-there, you will love Trine. Replayability is limited, however - as is multiplayer, so keep that in mind before buying. Give the demo a try, and if you enjoy it at least a little, it's definitely worth the asking price.

												This game is the reason I have bought a lot of other puzzle/platform games which didn't interest me in the past. Bought it on sale, decided to give it a crack and haven't looked back.Stunning visuals, devious puzzles with an almost perfect learning curve make this game amazing. Essentially the game revolves around having three charactors, Thief, Warrior and Wizard who all have unique abilities. The Thief can shoot a bow, and use a grapple to swing around and over obstacles, the Warrior is your melee charactor, with sword, shield and hammer, which can be used to bash through certain obstacles, and the Wizard who can leveitate objects and create boxes and ramps. As the game progresses, some of the chests you find will equip you with loot that enhance existing abilities, and also allow you to use them in different ways. This is alongside a relatively basic levelling system, which allows you enhance your abilities also.Some of the puzzles will have you using all three charactors to solve.The achievements blend well with the game, and will have you playing each level over over to find all the secrets and experience. Finding some of the secrets will leave you scratching your head, until ultimately leading to the AHA! moment when you finally work out how to get there/find it. 9.5/10 for me and definately worth buying. The fact that it comes on sale for $1 relatively regularly means this game just needs to be your inventory no matter what.			",180,58,0,31,25,0,25

												After having neglected this game for a long time, I decided to give it a try. So, here are my impressions.Visuals: This game is a real feast for the eyes. I find it redundant to describe it in detail, since it's overall beautiful.Gameplay: The control interface is comfortable and is neither too simple, nor needlessly complicated. The interaction of the characters with their envoirment is on a highly satisfying level, be it objects or enemies. What surprised me in a pleasant way are the physics in the game, making the platforming and puzzles a fun and challenging experience. The combat is rather simple, but decently done for this type of game. Sound: No objections, just like a cherry on top of the cake it rounds up an enjoyable game.So far it sounds like this is a perfect game. But, it does have it flaws, mainly the sadistic difficulty of the final level. Be warned, this is one unforgiving level with literally no room for error. The reason why it is signifficantly harder than the rest of the game is that not only it punishes every big mistake with the need to restart the level, and that it is quite fast-paced compared to the other levels. Another point is the replay value. Once you've completed the game, that is all what the story can offer, it has no extra content, only higher difficulty. That hardly means the replay value is zero, on the contrary. Unless you replay it several times in rapid succession, you can always rediscover this games charms and try to complete every challenge it offers.The verdict: 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, i was immediately shocked by the revelation that this is a beautifully crafted and perfected game. An adventure/RPG platformer, i refere to Trine as being a Mario-esque type of game, but with modern grafics. The creators of the game did a wonderfull job with perfecting the music, gameplay and feel of the game. It plays smooth, easy. The challenges are progressively hard, especially if you play on the hardest difficulty. Challenging. Thrilling. Beautiful. 10/10			",152,31,5,18,14,1,38

The effects from the hammer attacks looks godly and the different maps are very short, but I like them more. Enemies looks like poop, but I did enjoy this game more than the second one (which also is awesome).Nothing negative to say, just miss some things that you can do from Trine 2, but regardless of that, I think this game is worth every penny. Even at full price. Very short game though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Somehow I found this game (and the sequel) in my library. I don't remember buying it or even trading for it. Today I booted it up so I get some cards to sell and I figured I should at least play for an hour or so (the time it takes to get the cards.). After clicking ""Start"" I was instantly unable to quit the game. The graphics were amazing, the physics were amazing, the story was great. Heck, even the characters themselves were good. It's about a knight, a thief & a wizard being stuck together (Don't ask.) so you have to switch between the three and all of em have unique abilities. (Except the knight, he just kicks♥♥♥♥♥with his sword/hammer). It's mostly a puzzle game but it has some great fighting parts. There are also some RPG elements (leveling up your character & choosing skills etc.). I played it for 4 hours until I finally beat it.It is a great game and you should buy it and play it. Then buy it for your friends so they can play it. Then play together. (still have to try the multiplayer, hit me up if you want to play.) Right now, I'm off to play Trine 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the better indie titles out there, unforuntunately limited by somewhat questionable game design.While the levels and puzzles are gloriously thought out and realised, it's all built around how the developers intended the game to be played: with 3 people controlling each of the characters.This is important, because along with this assumption, the developers neglected to include online play, and made it local only. This meant the vast majority of people played it as a singleplayer game.And what happens in singleplayer? You ninja through the levels as the theif, bypassing many of the more challenging and enjoyable puzzles the game has to offer.Glorious graphics and co-operative design, but unless you have two others that are going to be playing with you, in the same room, with controllers (I mean really?), then you aren't really playing it as it should be played.Thankfully this was remedied in the second game.

												What an absolute joy to play and a really beautiful looking game. As far as platformers go this has actually been more fun for me, if of course less challenging, than Super Meat Boy which is one of the best platformers of all time. The colours, sound and voice acting are all so well created and put together that I struggle to find any flaws with the presentation and audio. The story is very simple as you would imagine so if you're looking for some sort of epic tale then this is probably not going to be first on your list. Controls are fluid although you cannot use a controller, something which I believe they fixed in the second edition to this series. I couldn't reccomend this game more to people who enjoy platformers or want to support good indie gaming or hell even people who just like looking at something pretty. Replay value is pretty high as there are tons of secrets and achievements to conquer as well as hard and very hard difficulty modes respectively. Overall a brilliant game and well worth the asking price on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome, they're making an enhanced edition with coop like Trine 2 so worth checking it if you are into platform puzzle games. Very casual setting. Enemies aren't difficult, makes you feel smart getting past obstacles, relaxing scenery and music. Only took 5-6 hours to beat but unfortunately not much replayability. Still worth the buy if it's on a Steam Sale.			",32,1,0,4,0,0,1

												Actually I played Trine 2 first but wanted to finish this one fast. So when I compare it to 2, the 2nd one is soooo much better. The battle was kinda pointless, since you always revive at the save point, mana kinda pointless, skill system useless,  and the puzzle too easy. With the wizard you got the god mode to nearly make anything happen. It still was fun to play it, but since I played 2 first, it was unfair to compare it with trine 2. But the graphic looks awesome and the dialoge were kinda funny.			",213,66,3,40,7,1,26

												A pretty cool indie platformer. I never actually beat it since it didn't spark my interest that much, but lets just say that if a serial killer locked me in a room and forced me to play this, I wouldn't kill myself. The graphics are the best part, and the different powers are cool and all, but the thief kind of breaks the game with her grappling hook. Cheers to the developers for making a fun game though, I hear Trine II is quite awesome as well.			",244,63,6,23,19,4,22

												Trine is a fantastic game for couples. It might be fun solo but I highly recommend playing it with 3 people (2 is fine as well). You can finish it in 5 hours and it has limited replayability.  If you replay with other people, its level of fun will range anywhere from amusing to downright hilarious depending on their personality and skill(same room and/or Continous Voice Transmission for the laughs). I definitely will not play this game again, however, unless someone wants to play and needs to fill out their party.			",27,5,0,10,1,0,1

												Trine is a 2D platformer created by Frozenbyte.BY POWER OR THREE HEROES... In Trine, player controls three different characters. The Wizard, who can create boxes and levitate things in the air. The Thief, who can shoot arrows and use her crabling hook. And The Knight, who's speciality is killing monsters and lifting heavy objects. Using these three different characters in puzzle solving and platforming player must make his way to several different gorgeus looking levels. BEDTIME STORIESGame's story in other hand, is kinda cliche. Three main character are by accident been connected to the magical artefact, Trine. By working together, they must find way to stop Undead army and find artefacts which could undo Trine's spell. Story won't seems like much first, but feels like it was rip off from bedtime storybook and sucks player into himself by it's charm and music.DIFFERENT KINDA PUZZLERTrine mixes in it's gameplay puzzle solving, platforming and hack 'n slash. Especially in puzzle solving game shines. Mixing all three characters player can find several different solutions in puzzles, but was those solved by own way, progressing feels satisfying. Game have couple problems which could be worth to mentioning. First, enemy waves have bad habit to continue even then, when player have had enough, and second, game don't have any kinda online co-op, which is shame, because this game almost sceam for the online co-op. Levels are full of secrets like exp-bottles and special items which give game small RPG-feeling.VERDICT:Trine is a beautiful and personal looking puzzle platformer with it's couple annoying parts and not having online co-op. I suggest everyone who have any kinda interest to puzzle games and/or platform games.      7.9/10			",47,10,0,2,6,0,1

												Trine ( Updated to Enchanced Edition BETA )Trine (EE) was a game that I set out to play long ago, but was distracted with blockbuster titles, which, I must add, I highly regret. I've ( personally ) had an amazing time playing Trine (EE), it so simplistic, yet it keeps your braining going. The vibrant colors and the care for detail was perfect ( kudos to the devs ). Trine (EE) is a must get for everyone, the control scheme ( I used a Microsoft Remote ) worked extremely smoothly, I found no bugs while playing the entire game! I highly recommend this game to everyone, whether it be for the level designs or gameplay style, everyone will enjoy this game. I must add, it is a great game to pull yourself into when tired of the standard RPG or FPS. Give this game a try and I promise, you will not regret it!!10/10			",310,67,6,47,23,8,37

												I seriously LOVE this game. You will, too. Go play it. It's a physics-based puzzle-platformer with combat as well, with collectibles. It seriously has everything. You can alternate at will with three different characters, a knight (good at fighting, has a shileld, can smash things), a thief (ranged weapon, can grapple to things), and a wizard (who can summon boxes, planks and floating platforms). Each level is filled with traps, platforms, undead skeletons summoned around you to attack, and you're constantly switching between characters. Want to kill that far-off archer? Use your thief to shoot it. Surrounded by melee baddies? Use your knight. Need to cross a dangerous pit? Use your wizard to summon things to make a path. There are tons of different ways to play, too. Trying to reach a high up ledge with a collecible on it? You can 1) shoot down the wood planks holding it up (if possible), 2) platform jump some tricky moves, 3) build a tower of blocks or a plank bridge and just walk right over to it, 4) summon something and use it to knock the collectible from the ledge to the ground. There are certain tasks that can only be done with a certain character, or need to be done with a certain character if you haven't upgraded another one sufficiently, but usually there are tons of different ways to brute force a problem.Pros:+Great art. Fantasy setting with lots of giant mushrooms and sparkling fairy plants in woodland settings, creepy dungeons with lava, broken down castles with poisonous goop.+Adjustable difficulty. The default is medium (which is what I played at) and there are sometimes a bunch of baddies swarming on you all at once, but they're usually three weak hits to kill the weak ones, then you start getting better equipped baddies with shield or armor that take more hits. You can play on easy and (I assume) have less baddies or easier to kill ones, or harder if you like a challenge. I'm going to definitely replay on a harder difficulty at some point because this game is truly awesome.+Pretty good music, never setting too serious a tone to fit the style of the game. Baroque fantasy.+MANY ways to solve puzzles, and they're never TOO challenging. Very fun.+Variety of puzzles. Running away from lava, fighting spiders in the dark, low-stress puzzles, complicated platform jumping, etc.+Decent voice acting. Not amazing (except for maybe the thief), but not intrusive or annoying.+XP and leveling. You collect XP through fighting, but also as collectibles. So the more adventurous you are trying to find the hidden ones, the more you level. There's a limited but interesting set of skills to upgrade, making your fighter tougher and making him charge and fling objects at people, and allowing your wizard to summon more objects, making puzzle and platforming easier, and making your thief shoot more arrows, or light things on fire, etc.+Fair checkpoints. Also, if one of your characters dies, you can switch to another. Anytime you want to revive a dead one, just go back to a checkpoint and they return with limited health. This helps A LOT if you really need the wizard for a puzzle but he just got murdered.Cons:-Uh...I'm getting really nitpicky here, because it's just a superbly fun, well-crafted game, but the final boss level has very few checkpoints, but it's the boss so I totally understand.10/10. Will play again. And the sequel.			",44,70,0,5,2,1,6

												Not a bad game, especially if it can be had for cheap.The graphics are good, and (for what it is) the writing is okay-ish. It has a bit of humour, and has personality that many games which cost five times as much would kill for. You can tell a lot of love went into this game.SADLY, it's really janky. The platforming mixed with physics can be really frustrating to play, not because it's difficult, but because it's not very accurate. This can lead to lots of ""miscalcuated"" jumps, and whatnot.Besides that, there's really not much variety to the game, and the core mechanics of switching between Wizard, Thief and Knight to battle and solve physics puzzles really don't cut it after a couple of hours.I'd be hard pushed to recommend this game at £6.99 unless you have a real itch for a physics-based puzzle/action/platformer. But if it's more than 25% off in a sale, go for it!3/5			",351,182,8,50,31,0,46

												Trine (Enhanced Edition) is a physics based puzzle-platformer. You take on the role of 3 adventures, a Knight, a Wizard and a Thief. you must use each of their skills as an individual (or all together if you play co-op) to make your way through each level, defeating monsters and puzzles alike.It is of course also worth noting, that if you hadn't noticed already: This game is gorgeous, the soundtrack fits perfectly, and the gameplay is sublime. It really is masterpiece of the genre(s), and is well worth your money.			",889,264,26,84,82,11,100

												One of my favourite co-op games. It's a lot of fun to play with casual gamer friends. Even more fun to regularly make them die by conjuring planks in front of their faces while they are jumping over a pit with acid in it, dropping skeletons on top of them mid-fight, or destroying summoned planks while they walk over them and thus dropping them in whatever green / red / blue stuff that will kill them :pPuzzles are nice, although quite easy. Makes it ideal for casual gamers and younger players. I'm neither, but still enjoy the game a lot because I play with friends. And yes indeed, I just wanted to show off I actually got friends ;) But seriously, it's a fun game!			",391,100,4,47,19,4,58

												I do recommend. It is like your grandfather telling you a bedtime story! The narrarator is great, his voice is so awesome. It looks pretty, especially on 11 (level) ""Ruins of the perished"". The combat is good to, the Knight is my favorite class. There is items you can find. Upgrades are pretty good, very linear. There is 3 parts to each type of upgrade like for instance the knights sword eventually is upgraded to a  flame sword . The imersion is so so because it does drag on eventually and let me explain. As you advance the levels keep on using alot of elements from earlier levels saying that the enemies do not change frequently as much as alot of other games. I would have like to see more enemies especially from a platformer game. It does get boring sometimes because the some of the levels look the same. The character interaction is only at the beginning of levels when they talk. I think it is worth your time and money so if you like platformers and medieval fantasy then this game is for you.

												I fell in love with the Rock-Paper-Scissors digital edition that is Trine back when it came out on 360 and it must have been the shader quality that is still there to this day, but something about it had me hooked. It has very well lit levels, and yet all the levels are dark, with fire everywhere, and enemies intertwined on different platforms, with swings, slides, and other sorts of mechanical objects to manipulate, but the way the light plays on the surfaces makes it into pure videogame artistry. With a difficulty at higher levels that makes even me cringe at the repressed memories of what it takes to beat the last level of this game without dying, it could take a normal gamer over 80 hours to even get close to perfect completion. I only stood a chance because I almost beat in on 360 when it came out, investiong about 80 hours, but by comparision the 360 version looks too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to enjoy as purely as this. Before the Enchanted Edition I could run this game at max settings, not anymore. That's amazing. They really cranked the fidelity and extended the life of a game that didn't even need to be revived, I wish this would happen with more games.			",225,47,9,21,11,2,25

												Trine is a good game, I mostly enjoyed it and I think my critisisms are just based on me not being a huge fan of platformers. You control three characters, switching between them at will. The wizard conjures objects to help you move around, the knight is for melee attacks, and the thief can use her bow to swing over gaps and attack from range. The fun part is figuring out how to combine these abilities to progress. At times the physics can be a little fiddly, not doing quite what you were hoping for, but its not a huge problem. Most areas have multiple solutions so the player shouldn't be stuck for long. I found the combat to be a bit tedious, as most enemies respawn about five times before finally staying dead. It feels like unnecessary padding. Level design is colourful and the story and voice acting are decent. I didn't suffer any bugs or crashes. Trine lasts around 6 hours, and there's not much scope for replayability, but the purchase price is cheap so value for money is good.			",144,30,0,15,8,2,16

												Trine, this game has received positive feedback in general, and to be honest, it is well deserved. It is probably the best side scrolling RPG I've ever played and one of the greatest side scrollers ever played. The gameplay itself is a combination of physics/platforming and combat. You switch between one of the three classes to deal with obtacles and progress in the game. The story itself is good, with a pretty intriguing story and cast of characters, the dialogue is good for a couple laughs here and there, making an overall enjoyable experience. With the prices this game has had, there is no excuse not to own this amazing game, its a purchase you won't regret.			",631,155,16,70,57,4,101

												I got Trine Collection which included this game as well as  Trine 2:The Complete Story for $5. What a deal! This game alone is worth more than $5. In a nutshell, Trine is a fantasy-themed platformer with physics-based puzzles.The player controls a knight, a thief, and a wizard on a quest to rid the land of a growing evil after they all become bound to a mysterious artifact called the Trine. Each character has his or her own attacks  and abilities. The knight has a sword and shield, the thief has a bow and a grappling hook, and the wizard can conjure objects and levitate them. It's fun to use the abilities of each character to figure out how to traverse wide spaces, open gates, and navigate to hard-to-reach areas. Because of the physics in the game, you can interact with the environment in all kinds of interesting ways. For example, when I first started playing, I thought the wizard was the weakest of the three characters to play. He seemed like a utility class since he can conjure up boxes to use to activate pressure plates or planks to traverse dangerous gaps. A running joke in the game is that he can't even cast a fireball. But even with no direct offensive capabilities he could, using the objects he conjures, crush enemies or push them off of dangerous ledges.You aren't stuck playing just one of the three characters, but you can hot swap to any one of them during the game when you find that the abilities of one are better suited to your present situation. You can play solo or with one or two friends in local or online co-op mode. I have done both and the game is fun to play either way. It feels very balanced no matter how you play.This game is a really polished product. The graphics are quite beautiful, with use of colors and lighting that really show off the artwork that makes up the environments that you traverse. The voice acting is also quite good and the narrator especially does a good job of unfolding the story as if he is reading a fairy tale. I also give high praise to the music and sounds effects which exhibit the same quality that the rest of the product has. The controls also feel very solid. I have played with a keyboard and mouse or, my preferred, way, with a game controller. I like how the knight, for example, can be running away while aiming his shield behind him. It's also neat how you use mouse gestures for the wizard to conjure up objects of varying sizes.To sum it up, if you haven't tried out this game, you should. I think you'll find a lot to like about it.			",45,43,1,3,6,0,6

												Somehow I found this game (and the sequel) in my library. I don't remember buying it or even trading for it. Today I booted it up so I get some cards to sell and I figured I should at least play for an hour or so (the time it takes to get the cards.). After clicking ""Start"" I was instantly unable to quit the game. The graphics were amazing, the physics were amazing, the story was great. Heck, even the characters themselves were good. It's about a knight, a thief & a wizard being stuck together (Don't ask.) so you have to switch between the three and all of em have unique abilities. (Except the knight, he just kicks♥♥♥♥♥with his sword/hammer). It's mostly a puzzle game but it has some great fighting parts. There are also some RPG elements (leveling up your character & choosing skills etc.). I played it for 4 hours until I finally beat it.It is a great game and you should buy it and play it. Then buy it for your friends so they can play it. Then play together. (still have to try the multiplayer, hit me up if you want to play.) Right now, I'm off to play Trine 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You get sucked into a beautiful world where you need to fight enemies and solve puzzles tied to the environment. The fights are pretty basic and the puzzles are a bit easy, probably because they need to be solved no matter how you upgraded your characters along the way. Pros: beautiful artwork, beautiful music. Cons: easy puzzles. Pretty good!  Rating: sugar, spice, and everything nice.http://pixelloot.com ",71,18,0,5,10,0,30

												Trine: Enchanted Edition is a game of beauty and story. It only has the downfall of the small breath of time that it takes to complete the game but as a whole this game is stunning, rich, quick and smart.Use the abilities of Zoya the thief, Amadeus the wizard or Pontius the Knight to traverse the world of the Ruined Kingdom  and restore it to its forgotten beauty. The controls are easy and quick and the gameplay fast. You will use the abilities of the three heroes to their fullest to complete this game.IMHO: 9/10			",165,79,1,15,31,0,7

												Trine proves that if you have an original mix of ideas, even old school gameplay can still work great, especially when paired with incredible visuals and extremely polished code.

Gameplay is fun, there is alot of hidden stuff in the game, achievements are easy to get, none of them are impossible or near to.However, it might be a little bit easy, while the last stage and secret stage are ridiculously hard, especially on hardest difficulty.i'd definitly recommand this game to anyone that likes Platformers.Overall: 9/10.(a longer game with an online mode would give it a perfect score!)TRINE 2 HAS ONLINE CO-OP.Note; trine 1 still has LOCAL-CO-OP.

												Trine ( Updated to Enchanced Edition BETA )Trine (EE) was a game that I set out to play long ago, but was distracted with blockbuster titles, which, I must add, I highly regret. I've ( personally ) had an amazing time playing Trine (EE), it so simplistic, yet it keeps your braining going. The vibrant colors and the care for detail was perfect ( kudos to the devs ). Trine (EE) is a must get for everyone, the control scheme ( I used a Microsoft Remote ) worked extremely smoothly, I found no bugs while playing the entire game! I highly recommend this game to everyone, whether it be for the level designs or gameplay style, everyone will enjoy this game. I must add, it is a great game to pull yourself into when tired of the standard RPG or FPS. Give this game a try and I promise, you will not regret it!!10/10			",310,67,6,47,23,8,37

												I fell in love with the Rock-Paper-Scissors digital edition that is Trine back when it came out on 360 and it must have been the shader quality that is still there to this day, but something about it had me hooked. It has very well lit levels, and yet all the levels are dark, with fire everywhere, and enemies intertwined on different platforms, with swings, slides, and other sorts of mechanical objects to manipulate, but the way the light plays on the surfaces makes it into pure videogame artistry. With a difficulty at higher levels that makes even me cringe at the repressed memories of what it takes to beat the last level of this game without dying, it could take a normal gamer over 80 hours to even get close to perfect completion. I only stood a chance because I almost beat in on 360 when it came out, investiong about 80 hours, but by comparision the 360 version looks too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to enjoy as purely as this. Before the Enchanted Edition I could run this game at max settings, not anymore. That's amazing. They really cranked the fidelity and extended the life of a game that didn't even need to be revived, I wish this would happen with more games.			",225,47,9,21,11,2,25

												This game is beautiful. It's fun. It manages not to frustrate the hell out of you. Plus the lovely Thief has the voice of Isabela from Dragon Age 2. You can shoot skeletons, smash 'em, chop 'em or just drop something heavy onto them. The puzzles are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like they are in some games and... wheee grappling hoooooooo...Quite frankly, the visuals are stunning. I'm normally not one to focus on graphics but Trine is really excellent. Which is good, because it's not one of the soulless, mass-produced turds that get released so much lately. That could tempt you to think it's just the visuals. but no, as I said - while it depends on the player, I found the balance between combat, puzzles and platforming quite appealing. There are also things to pick up for all the completionists, so you might find yourself replaying Trine if you're that kind of a person. I guess my main gripe with the game could be that it doesn't really have big flaws. It's not frustrating, you might actually consider that one. I don't. The game isn't really particularly hard, except possibly finding all the hidden thingamajigs. While there's not much of variety in opponents, they're not exactly the main focus either and the levels actually show variety. Which is pretty good, as copy-pasting is a pretty nasty sin.Trine hits quite a few nice spots and it calls back to the nostalgia days of Super Mario, just without taking the wrong cues - instead of picking up the ugly graphics and frustration, it takes the spirit of platforming and adds a spin on it. And while it uses physics for its puzzles, it avoids the pitfalls of that fairly well, delivering quite consistent results to what you do. It also gives you freedom to approach a few places in different ways, which is good - but as my memory serves, that resulted in me mostly using the Thief and the Wizard, with the Knight just doing bugger all except freak accidents when he was actually needed.The game is pretty good, if a little short. I'm a bit on the fence whether it's a good thing or not, but then again it does avoid the pitfall of stretching everything too far and lets you have some carefree fun in between things. It's not even particularly rough around the edges, so it's definitely worth checking out.			",311,62,6,66,55,4,91

												Trine!! Such a great idea and also well implemented... what else can you ask for? This is one of those games that are kind of special to me, along with its sequel Trine 2. Athough the game was launched in 2009, the developers updated the game not long ago with a lot of new stuff. I never really paid too much attention to the story of the game, but that's just because the game is so fun that I was always eager to get started. The gameplay mechanics are great, I love how each character does different things and serves a different role within the group. In fact, I'd recommend playing this game with your significant other/housecarl. This is one of those great co-op games, definitely perfect for a couple or maybe even some friends... so long as there are just 3 of you! It is true that the game is not hard at all, with the exception of the last stages,  but even on easy it'll take you some time to find everything in the game and discover all its secrets. I just managed to get all the achievements and it took me about 15 hours, but I'd say the main game would take you about 6 or 7 hours. Definitely more if you replay some of the stages, or if you like to go treasure hunting like me!  Oh, and in case none of your friends have the game but you still want to collaborate with other people while playing, remember that Trine also has an online mode. Besides all this, the game is in a lot of different languages and the dubbing is also very good in all the versions I've heard so far. I'd mention its cons, but I simply don't see any. Don't think about it too much, just choose the knight, the thief or the wizard and find that elusive Trine before it's too late!			",294,108,1,50,22,3,48

												I was very happy from start to finish playing Trine. Trine is a relatively short platformer that uses 3 distinct characters with unique skills to help you progress and collect all the experience bottles throughout each level. You can change characters on the fly just by pressing 1, 2 or 3. The visuals are stunning and I was constantly just looking at the scenery. The sound is equally good, with fantastic music that suited each level. It's worth noting the sound effects were all great and of very high quality. There are several different enemies and ""bosses"" throughout the game. However, the enemies lack variety and will constantly repeat over and over. I put bosses in quotes because they are actually quite easy. Maybe mini-bosses is a better term. Trine is a very forgiving game (played on the default difficulty). It's easy to pick up and play a level. It never gets very difficult and has a very generous checkpoint/revival system. The story is as good as it can be for a game like this. There's not much too it, but it’s conveyed well to the player through a fantastic narrator. The controls are ok. Sometimes I got frustrated with my character motion and jumping onto ledges. But it is a minor gripe. To fix my framerate stutter +I ran an uncapped fps and left it to vsync to run at 60fps. This caused stuttering every couple of seconds. I fixed this by telling Trine in the options to run at a capped 60fps. Completely smooth after thatFix input lag+Another easy fix. My mouse input lag was pretty bad. Trine has an option to reduce lag. You'll want to put a check mark in that boxPros+Beautifully styled graphics.+Sound design is solid.+Overall platforming is fun.+Game rewards you (with experience) for exploring corners and trying to find the secret chests.+Smooth 60fps+Stable. Never crashed on my Windows 8.1 machine+Great narrator voice acting.+Fun puzzles and having to think how to progress furtherCons+Not much to the story.+At times I fought with the controls+Default difficulty could be a little more challenging+Only a few useful power-ups. A lot of them don't affect the characters much. (This may change when played on a harder difficulty)+Very few unique enemies.8/10 Very goodI would absolutely recommend Trine. The regular price of $14.99 seems a little much. I would not pass this up if it goes on sale. I got the Trine collections for $2.49 during the 2014 Summer Sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am not just stuck being a thief, mage, or knight. I am all three. I am now playing it through for the second time (on the hard setting) and this time I notice even more of the detail put into the game and the story. I haven't done multiplayer yet.  It is just too much fun alone, but maybe I'll try if a friend gets the game.  I look forward to playing Trine 2.			",33,31,0,2,1,0,1

												First of all, buy this game! I am not really a fan of platformers and puzzle games but I really loved this one. And there are dozens of reasons I did.Gameplay: It feels like an old school platformer with all the running and jumping across the screen, but it gives you something more than that. Unique abilities of the heroes allows you to make your own choices of how you want to cross a gap or how you want to get to some extra experience points. Moreover, you can vary methods of getting rid off your enemies - making it shooting an arrow (thief), waving your sword (knight) or smashing them with a box (wizard). The puzzles player encounter through the game are not hard at all, still hard enough to feel satisfaction of getting through from time to time. Maybe that doesn't sound that fun or new, but believe me this is really entertaining. The only down thing about the gameplay is Boss fights that feel repetitive and rather dumb - hit & jump.Gaphics: The game has unique atmosphere and the art of each level is just beautiful. I found myself feeling really enjoying the picture. Enchanted Edition stands for enhanced graphics edition for the original game and it feels pretty up-to-date.Controls: Strange thing - I tried to play the game using Xbox controller and found mouse and keyboard far better way of playing the game. Still it is pretty much playable using gamepad. I was also happy to find out that there is a local co-op mode in the game which allows you to play the game with your friends using gamepads and mouse & keyboard at one machine.Verdict: This game has a really strong impression on me. I was surprised how I got into it easily and spent first two hours feeling like it was only 15 minutes. I really like spending some time after work playing it - feels relaxing. And after I finish this one there are still Trine 2 and 3 that await me.I recommend it to all of you guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extremely funny in co-op.Trine turns around the simple concept of fantasy adventure with monsters, undeads, wizards, demons, warriors, thiefs, etc. and makes it really ejoyable expecially in multiplayer. It has a nice fairytale-like atmosphere and can take you playing for hours thanks to the simple and funny gameplay, the uniqueness of the characters and the variety of the level design.Graphics are simple but effective. Recreate perfectly the classic fantasy enchanted world you're expecting to see.I'd reccomend it if you're searching for a nice adventure game. Expecially if you're planning to play with a couple of friends.			",153,46,2,26,23,2,46

The platforming is one of a kind, find your own way through the levels, with every level and area available to be transformed and manipulated to your own play style, with whichever character your prefer the most. Although the story is quite dark, the world is being sucked of its magic and happiness, the developers have really gone out of their way to make this story fantasticly fun, and the comedy and witty banter between characters cuts through the doleful yet beautiful and comedic storyline. If you haven't already gotten Trine, give it a try. I'm looking forward to both the 2nd and 3rd installments.			",118,12,20,17,8,2,3

												Actually I have been playing Trine 2 before the first episode. That was the reason I had great expectations, but sadly Trine offers lower quality in every aspect. Oh, okay not sadly, because that means the sequel is better. I was playing this title in couch co-op mode, and we had great 18 hours of enjoyment. Both 1 and 2 have a demo so try them and get the Complete Story if you like it. I did so, and did not regret it. My daughter neither.			",122,28,3,18,8,1,19

												This game is absolutely gorgeous. The graphics are amazing, but aside from that, the gameplay, which is what really matters is superb. You feel like you are in a book as a narrator dictates a story of how 3 very different people with unique abilities find an object and are sent on an adventure. You must develop strategies to get across difficult levels as some characters are more useful than others in some places. The gameplay is unforgettable and is appropriate for all ages, as I let my little sister play, who loves it.9.5/10Get it while it is 99 cents, you won't regret your decision....Also get Trine 2 while its on sale if you like this one			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very fun sidescrolling/platformer fantasy game with some RPG elements in that your characters do earn skill points that you get to choose to allot to any of the up to 3 skills per character. There are 3 characters, including a wizard/conjurer, a thief/rogue, and a knight/warrior. Each is designed to be quite different in abilities and playstyle because you will be using all 3, which you can switch between at the push of a button as you play. You make use of the talents of each to progress through the levels, enemies, and puzzles. It is a pretty unique system and is well implemented. The game will probably not take you more than 10 hours to but the visuals/environments look really good and it does a good job of keeping you engaged and wanting to always play just a little longer to get to the next checkpoint.

												I thought I'd treat myself and get the Frozenbyte collection for £4. And I'm really glad I did!My initial impressions after watching the trailer were very 'meh' it's good for a small game, but when I loaded it up and started playing, I'm really quite taken!Graphically, I find it gorgeous. It appeals to me. Yeah, fair enough, it's thief, magician and knight, and that's been done to high heaven, but as a side scroller platform game, I'm loving it!!I've only played about an hour so far, and I'm really going to be playing more!For a side scrolling RPG hack/slash/grappling/thieving/magick physics platformer (and I normally don't play them often) this is an absolute steal!!

												Trine is a side-scrolling action platform and puzzle video game, developed by Frozenbyte. GameplayThe player controls and switches between three different characters (a thief, a knight, and a wizard) to try to complete levels. There is also a cooperative play feature, whereby multiple players can join in at any time to control different characters simultaneously. Each character has their own health and energy meter. Energy is used for certain weapons and abilities, and is replenished by blue-colored bottles found throughout levels. Health is replenished by collecting heart-shaped containers, which result from destroying certain enemies.This game is basically like a strategic puzzle solving story that just gets funner the more you play it. I bought it for i think .99 USD and for that price and this quality of gaming, i would HIGHLY!! recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this type of game. A solid 8/10			",56,2,4,3,4,1,4

												Trine was absolutely spectacular. I usually do not enjoy many platformer games, but in this case, I was pleasantly surprised. The visual aspect of the game is just gorgeous. The lighting really does make it feel 'enchanted' (enchanted edition). However, this alone is not what makes this game spectacular. It is the fact that there are so many creative ways in which you can complete puzzles and get about and around in the game that made me stick around. You play as 3 people whose souls are stuck in the Trine. If you play alone, then you have to switch out between the Wizard, the Thief, and the Warrior. Each character has different special abilities, giving you the opporunity to solve the same puzzles in so many different ways. As a gamer, it really makes you feel creative when you solve a difficult puzzle/climb a difficult part of a level in your own unique way. It is all up to you in how you will get around in the game, whether it be using the Thief's grappling hook or the wizard's floating platform (etc). This game is amazing because there are no limits and no standards to how you solve a puzzle/level. It is all up to your imagination :). This is definitely worth playing!			",170,71,1,17,14,0,8

												Quick Summary: Side scrolling platformer with great graphics and some tricky (but not too tricky) puzzle solving and light combat. Great game for casual co-op as well.You play a trio of heroes trapped in a single body by a mysterious magical artifact called the Trine. While your souls are bound, you can be any one of the three characters at any time: Wizard, Thief, or Knight. Your quest is to find out why you’re bound together and how to undo the “curse.” The game is played with keyboard and mouse though other players can drop in using a game controller on the same computer. You progress mostly from left to right in a two dimensional plane with a lot of jumping and scrambling from one level to another. With a press of a button you can instantly switch between the three characters, each with their unique skills useful for fighting (knight) grappling (thief) or conjuring objects to use (wizard). Each of the characters has their own life bar so if they die you need to either make do with the other 2 characters or backtrack until you get to a checkpoint (a glowing sphere). You can backtrack as much as you want in this game, which is useful since there are a lot of collectibles to be found. The collectibles mainly come in the form of experience potions, and when you level up you can upgrade skills unique to each character class (for example increasing the number of objects the wizard can have conjured at any one time).Pros:+Amazing graphics for a little indie game. The environments look 3D despite being a simple side scroller.+Free upgrade to the Enchanted Edition. The upgraded version uses the Trine 2 engine and got a large number of new Steam achievements.+Nice story with good narration. The narrator appears as an announcer in Dota 2 so you may recognize his voice.Cons: Not much really, the game is awesome.This is a great, cheap game that anyone can get into. If you didn’t get it for free sometime in the past you can probably see it in Humble Bundles occasionally. Play with friends and family! ",655,206,34,57,43,12,103

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Platform fighting game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are Subtitles that you are able to Toggle.The game is fully voiced over.You are able to turn the audio voice off.There is a brightness thing but i don't think this is needed unless you want to tune it down.You are able to play this with a xbox controller.Able to toggle ""Tooltips""You are able to toggle ""FPS cap"" and choose your own cap number.You are able to change your keyboard or Xbox controller controls. You are able to make multiple save slots to CONTROL CHANGES.You are able to turn on the xbox controller vibration :D :)You are able to change the mouse and xbox controller sensitivity speed.There is a Master volume.There is a Sound and speech volume.There is a Music Volume.About the game.You play with 3 different characters but only one at at time. You are able to switch from characters at any time you want. Each character has their own power. There is a Mage, Archer and a Warrior. The game has amazing graphics a decent storyline. Game however could be a little bit repetitive, because mostly the thing that you are doing is, Moving and fighting.  The game is from the side. So that means you are only able to move left or right.  From time to time you will see a checkpoint which will also heal and revive dead allies. Sadly the game has collectables. The game has some kind of Perk/level up system.Mage: Is able to create objects and move objects with magical powers, which is really useful to go to some area's that arent possible to reach without it. You can summon wooden planks and squares for an example. You are able to use your magical power to move some of the objects to build bridges with or you can throw them hurt enemies. Some of the collectables are very easy to obtain with this ""Summon"" ability.Archer: Is able to shoot a grappling hook into wooden objects, so that you are able to swing around and move to new area's or avoid dangerous platforms. You are able to shoot more then 1 arrow if you are going to upgrade the skill or even turn your arrows into fire. This character is usually used to move around fast throughout levels.Warrior:  Is able to use the shield to defend and block the incoming damage. Has a sword that is upgradeable to do more damage. You are able to charge into enemies and push them back with a big knockback and you are also able throw and move objects with your shield. Some area's could be difficult to reach with this guy but he is mainly a fighter character anyway.Game is casual and calming.Has interesting storyline.You are able to play multiplayer.Music is very good.Graphics is fine but some area's could be hurtful.Graphics is colorful.There are collectables :(Other things.Colors COULD hurt your eyes.I HATE COLLECTABLES.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10 ",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

												I played first the Trine 2 game, which was amazing and stunning with beautiful graphics and the best music i have ever heard in a game! Now i decided to play the Trine 1 enchanted edition, which i was sceptical about it, because it is older than the first trine i played.. But i have to admit that it worths every moment i spent on it.The atmosphere is cool and the music is sth else!! Ithe graphics isnt as cool as the trine 2, but i like them !The only thing that is makes me feal a bit strange is the controls, feels a bit sloppy to me but it is not that bad, but Trine 2 is superior in controling matters!But even though the sloppy controls i loved this game, i have to finish it to complete my experience with the series!! Guys you have to give it a try, but please it is better to play it after trine 2, trust me , you ll more things to understand and love in the game!! so its an 8/10 from me			",200,51,11,19,11,0,31

												You remember years ago, when you used to sit down for an hour or two and play a videogame? After school and before dinner, kicking off your shoes and curling up with Crash or Ratchet until the TV went off and the food was done? Not a 6 hour binge or a 12 hour marathon session, but just a wind-down and chill out session of zen gaming? Well if you need to be remended then I highly recommend Trine.

												One of the most beautiful platform games ever. The controls are easy to use and the online co-op is awesome. Some of the mages boxes glitch around but other then that I had no problems. Although, there seems to be a bug with the in-game voice when playing with more then one player. The voice auto turns on at the start of each level. If you are using Skype then it can be annoying, because you have to switch it off all the time. If you are not using an external communication program then it should be fine, unless you really don't want to talk. I love the Trine games, they are all enjoyable and have a replayability factor.

												This is good game for players who want to play puzzle-platformer games. Levels are sometimes very challenging  but sometimes easy, too. Game story is interesting and enemies aren't too difficult, actually too easy. Too little bosses, but nevermind. Especially final boss & level is very changelling, so the end of this game is the best.Backgrounds of the levels are beautiful and finely done. Graphics are good. Characters of this game are Mage (Amadeus), Thief (Zoya) and Knight (Pontius). They all have their own talents and weakness. That makes game more interesting.Nice game, worth to buy, but maybe it's better to buy this with 50%-75% discount because this isn't very long game.4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More of a puzzle game with light combat aspects that revolves around you cycling between three different playstyles to progress throughout the level. It took me 9 hours to complete and I pretty much just stayed on as the thief throughout most of the game. It kind of seemed like the warrior and the mage were useless unless you specifically needed them for a part of the puzzle or some heavy combat. The game was still a fairly good game but is lacking in content and the story isn't all that great. The mechanics are unique though and it was an enjoyable game for a playthrough, try to get it on sale.3/5Fun game but not worth $15 due to it's lacking content. The mechanics are unique but you end up playing mnost of the game on a single character instead of switching between them let they designed it to be. Kinda easy also, casual gameplay.

												This game is very fun and simple. You get to play as three players (in singleplayer) which you get to constantly switch between at any time with no restrictions, making the game somewhat easy. All you have to do is kill monsters, solve puzzles, beat levels, and finish with a challenge in a final tower. This game is set on a 2D platform. In my opinion, the story is too short for the regular price. If you do a medium run (stop usually to collect extra experience and find secrets), then this game will last you about 5-6 hours. Long runs (stop more frequently and stop to look at the backgrounds) 7-8 hours; short runs (speedruns) 2-4 hours. I would recommend buying this game when it is on sale, especially in a collection (Trinelogy or Frozenbyte Collection 2016). If the beautiful backgrounds attracted you (like me) then definetly get this game. Trust me, you won't regret it. In summary, a good game when it is on sale. This game has some of the best level artwork of all the games on Steam.			",33,5,0,3,1,0,1

												You remember years ago, when you used to sit down for an hour or two and play a videogame? After school and before dinner, kicking off your shoes and curling up with Crash or Ratchet until the TV went off and the food was done? Not a 6 hour binge or a 12 hour marathon session, but just a wind-down and chill out session of zen gaming? Well if you need to be remended then I highly recommend Trine. This gorgeous plateformer delivers level after stunning level of puzzle-platform fun in a relatively short but action packed package. I played through with an xbox360 controller and was pleasantly reminded of the console platformers I grew up on.  All in all a game well worth your time and dollar.

												On hell of a fun game.The graphics are lovely,the puzzles are like how the puzzles in HL2 are fluid but some a bit more challenging. Plenty of side scroller action. If you want to play through the story and enjoy the combat this game will not let you down. Id even recommend buying  the Trine bundle which comes with Trine 1 + Trine 2 complete. However I will say the gameplay mechanics are the same between the two with Trine 2 have more color to its graphics and having co-op. If you are a fan of side scrolling action, with a light touch of rpg elements this game will not let you down. It has controller support but I find keyboard + mouse to be much more enjoyable to use.Bottom Line: Worth gtting if you want to play the story of the characters from their beginning.Now with its enhanced edition it comes with the Trine 2 graphics and co-op.

												Trine is a superb game to look at - quite possibly the most graphically lush side-scroller I've yet come across. With twin 4890's onboard in Crossfire, this game pretty much ramps up the cooling fans straight away - it's that demanding with the eye candy turned on.Trine is effectively a thinking man's hack 'n slash, mixed in with a bit of puzzle solving. The three main characters in the game - a wizard, thief and knight become 'fused' together allowing you pick the relevant character for the task at hand. Along the way experience is picked up which you can apply to one of the three characters as you see fit. The only gripe I've yet comes across wih the game is the absurdly large gap between checkpoint saves - which can see you redoing literally several minutes of a stage if all three characters die.Aside from that, I'd highly recommend Trine as an enjoyable, beautiful and quite cerebral game. 8/10.

												Trine is a good game, I mostly enjoyed it and I think my critisisms are just based on me not being a huge fan of platformers. You control three characters, switching between them at will. The wizard conjures objects to help you move around, the knight is for melee attacks, and the thief can use her bow to swing over gaps and attack from range. The fun part is figuring out how to combine these abilities to progress. At times the physics can be a little fiddly, not doing quite what you were hoping for, but its not a huge problem. Most areas have multiple solutions so the player shouldn't be stuck for long. I found the combat to be a bit tedious, as most enemies respawn about five times before finally staying dead. It feels like unnecessary padding. Level design is colourful and the story and voice acting are decent. I didn't suffer any bugs or crashes. Trine lasts around 6 hours, and there's not much scope for replayability, but the purchase price is cheap so value for money is good.			",144,30,0,15,8,2,16

												Trine, this game has received positive feedback in general, and to be honest, it is well deserved. It is probably the best side scrolling RPG I've ever played and one of the greatest side scrollers ever played. The gameplay itself is a combination of physics/platforming and combat. You switch between one of the three classes to deal with obtacles and progress in the game. The story itself is good, with a pretty intriguing story and cast of characters, the dialogue is good for a couple laughs here and there, making an overall enjoyable experience. With the prices this game has had, there is no excuse not to own this amazing game, its a purchase you won't regret.			",631,155,16,70,57,4,101

												PROS+ Graphics/VisualsThe graphics in Trine are colorful and enveloped in a vibrant bloom, creating a magical and dream-like ambiance. The beauty is even more apparent when playing at 4K resolution or downsampled from such. + MusicThe music is pleasant and fits nicely with the visual style; also pizzicato strings rule. CONS- Faulty ControlsIronically, controls are wonky considering platforming is a core mechanic of the game. One of my problems was, for example, turning around on a dime and then jumping onto a platform; this often resulted in not grasping onto a ledge and falling, making fast platforming difficult. It was often more practical to give yourself extra space, turn around, wait for a second, and then attempt a jump. If this issue sounds strange, trust me, you would know what I am talking about if you played for yourself. Something else I noticed was that tapping the jump key as oppose to a longer press would cover a shorter distance. As a consequence, if you had to jump multiple platforms in quick succession, you would often fail and have to repeat, making for irksome moments. Finally, the character would at many times fail to grasp onto to a ledge despite clearly being able to do so; once again, leading to frustration. - Basic CombatThere is nothing special about the combat in Trine; it is quite shallow with no outstanding features. The one character, Amadeus, is next to useless for combat because he has no proper attack. You have to summon a cube, levitate it above an enemy, and let it fall crushing him. Attacking like this is fun at first but gets old, and is far too slow especially when dealing with several foes. With Amadeus being incompetent, only the other two characters are practical for fighting.- Underwhelming and Skippable PuzzlesPuzzles were not impressive since none really stood out to me. Making matters worse, are the character abilities which make many portions of the game skippable. A prime example would be conjuring Amadeus' triangle block and then using Zoya's grapple to transverse over an area in a way not intended. Even Amadeus alone is a problem since you can summon several blocks and planks to advance effortlessly. You could avoid upgrading Amadeus fully, but self-imposed limitations are never fun.- Repetitive GameplayTrine's gameplay is repetitious due to the reuse of content throughout the game. Not much changes in regards to combat, platforming, and puzzles, thus being a bit of a bore to play.- Difficulty CurveMost of the playthrough is far too easy, even on hard; however, once reaching the final level, the difficulty suddenly spikes. In this last level, you have to rush intensifying previously mentioned problems leading one to curse out loud. The difficulty curve which stagnates for the most part and then suddenly shoots up hurts this title big time.CONCLUSIONThe visuals and music of Trine are charming but do little for the overall experience. The combination of core mechanics is admittedly interesting but unfortunately dissonant to the extent of fundamentally breaking gameplay. Then there are other issues adding further insult to injury; I can not recommend this game. Ultimately, I give Trine a PAR of 1.IMPORTANT: I use PARS instead of a standard 1-10 scale.

												   Ok let me start by saying any criticism aside, that I straight up loved this game and look forward to playing the next 2. However there are some pros and cons to the beautiful Trine: Enchanted Edition. As just mentioned this games design and beauty is what immediately drew me in and is what compelled me to buy the trilogy on steam and give it a run.   Trine is a platformer that uses three main characters who you are able to swap between to complete different tasks in the level. The Mage who can summon different items that become very useful, the Thief who is the archer of the group, & the Warrior who can take on foes face to face.   The flaws in Trine are minimal but almost all have to do with AI. The enemies wander into their own demise quite often, which doesn’t take you out of the game experience quite as much as when the bosses stomp right off the cliff. This usually happens when he is chasing you and your character falls off the cliff as well, but when you swap characters or respawn the boss is still gone which leads to some overly simplistic battles.   The story in Trine is kind of throw away, and serves more as a loading screen filler than anything. For this kind of game though that is actually a pretty good fit & did not leave me wanting more narrative. There is a narrator who explains the heroes plight and what they are about to delve into before each level.   So as you can imagine, the enemies and bosses killing themselves of can make for some pretty easy levels. I flew through the regular levels with relatively no problem, but when you come to the last level prepare to strap yourself in for a doozy. No matter how far you get, unless you reach the one check point at the very top, you will be sent straight back to the beginning over and over. This type of push back on the last level always endears a game to me I think the completion of a game should be a challenge and in that area Trine delivers.    My experience with the first of the Trine trilogy most definitely has me looking forward to the other two, & with the company partnering with GameStop for publishing on a new project, now is a good time to dig into the games if you haven’t already.For more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blogHttp://www.SublimeGameReviews.wordpress.com & follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews			",228,133,7,33,40,2,19

												I personally like new twists on old classics, so I look for influences of good oldies in newer games. So when I was first introduced to “Trine”, I was all like: here are new “The Lost Vikings” (by Blizzard, 1992): three characters, each one with his strength and weaknesses complementing each other and solving little puzzles to complete levels.“Trine” is not, of course a copy of “Vikings”: it is more of an action, the puzzles are a bit easier, characters transform to each other, not being present on screen simultaneously (much like Silmarils’ “Metal Mutant” of 1991). Of course game looks much and much better, the world is designed beautifully,Game’s characters get experience from killing monsters and finding secrets, which can also contain unique items. Level-ups make them stronger in combat and platforming.So if you are into mildly difficult puzzle-platformers with a bit of RPG elements, you should check this one out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Odlična igra!Sve pohvale za igru i njene kreatore. Stvarno su se potrudili da igra u svakom elemetnu bude zanimljiva i prijatna za igranje.Trine je 2D igra sa zanimljivom pričom koja će Vas naterati da se osećate kao da ste u nekoj bajci, a pomoć celom doživljaju daje i neverovatan glas naratora koji Vas vodi kroz celu ovo avanturu. Na to se nadovezuje predivna grafika sa puno boja i detalja, lepo osmišljeni likovi sa jedinstvenim umećem i na sve to (kao da ovo prethodno nije dovoljno) prijatna i opuštajuća muzika koja Vas prati tokom cele igre i upotpunjuje ceo doživljaj.Sama igra se svodi na to da upravljate sa tri ličnosti i rešavate zadatke koji su pred Vama, pritom skupljajući iskustvo kako bi unapredili vaše ličnosti. U skladu sa zadatim problemom birate koja će ličnost, na osnovu svojih mogućnosti, biti najbolja za rešavanje problema. Kako se igra bude bližila kraju biće Vam potreban zajednički rad dve ili sve tri ličnosti da rešite određeni problem. Naravno ovo je samo ukratko, igra Vam pruža mnogo više.Bilo bi stvarno velika šteta da propustite da probate igru koja je sa ovoliko pažnje i detalja urađenja, koja ne traži zver od računara, gde se na svaki detalj, i onaj najmanji, mislilo.Još jednom, sve pohvale i velika preporuka svima da probaju ovu neverovatnu igru.

I spent many hours there and had a good time.We play as the wizard, hunter or a knight, and we have the task to find the treasure ""trine"" who brought us to the ancient world. We can at any time switch between characters.There are 15 very different levels of the impassable. On your way you will meet many enemies. Sometimes you need to think how to really pass the level.Graphics and music stands at a high level.You can buy it very cheap on sale, but is worth a lot more.I recommend.

												I would recommend this game. You are switching between 3 main characters, a wizard (who I have named Harry), a theif and a knight. Each of the characters have their own abilites (a bow, magic ect) which can advance as the game goes on. The setting and people looks realistic, but it is not a graphic game. Overall, I would recommend Trine to anybody with a sense of adventure.			",10,2,0,1,1,1,5

												Trine is basically The Lost Vikings as a physics-based puzzle platformer, offering three characters with very different skillsets and many ways you can use them to approach the game's puzzles and challenges. It's not terribly hard unless you play it on the hardest difficulties, mostly due to offering infinite lives and copious checkpoints, but it always feels like a fun adventure and doesn't lack for challenge, even if you'll be able to respawn until you complete it eventually.Plus it's got an amusing sense of humor and a solid artstyle, and with the Enchanted Edition upgrade, online multiplayer for when you want to help (or screw over) your friends through the levels. It's hard to not recommend Trine to anyone who's interested in puzzle platformers at all.			",923,363,8,393,62,1,217

												Truly one of the most impressive games I've ever played. The art alone is worth buying this, but the game is actually really fun and well done also. As for the art, it's not just the drawings/models/textures, but the animation is pure genius as well. Every moving thing in the game is done with absolute perfection, and even though it's sort of a ""2d platformer"" as for genre, everything is done in 3D with great precision. Just the way the warrior blocks with his shield clearly has sooo much time and thought put into perfecting the action. And everything else is done with just as much care. I don't have as much detail to say about them, but the music and sound effects are just as great as the visual effects, and clearly just as well-perfected. The physics are absolutely perfect, again done with absolute precision and perfection, with almost real life precision and realism. I'm on I think the 5th level, and there isn't a *ton* of combat, but there's just enough and it's well done like everything else. The game is probably a bit more puzzle-platformer than action(so far.. and I should say there's plenty of platform jumping, swinging, and hand/eye coordination stuff.. you just aren't constantly fighting enemies the entire time too), but the puzzles are great.. not unrealistically impossible, but they require some thought and dexterity and they continue to get more challenging the further you go. In every aspect, this is one of my most satisfying purchases. And by the way, if you try the demo and like the concept, but aren't sure if there's enough to it, you gain more abilities and everything gets SO much cooler as you get further in. The wizard can create more boxes and also platforms(and there's still 4 more ability slots I don't know what they do... that's 4 for EACH character, and I think 5 more for the thief), the warrior gets a charge ability(and 3 or 4 more I don't have yet) and you get various special items for even more abilities, customization, and bonuses.

												Trine caught my attention cause I love platform games.  This one took me by surprise.  The attractive graphics, smooth animation, and the interesting differences between characters make this game a must play.  Now with enhanced graphics using the Trine 2 engine, this game only got better.  There are some downfalls to this game such as the fact that you fight only against skeletons and then a dismal amount of bosses makes it too repetitive.  Other than that, it's a great game that you can't miss.  Frozenbyte, the creators of the Shadowground series, has definitely put their name on the map with Trine.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												Thoroughly disappointed after seeing the reviews. I expected a charming character driven experience but instead found minimal characterisation, story and dialogue, repetitive boss fights (there are seriously only two repeated throughout the game) and bland enemies (of which there are four), easily solvable physics ""puzzles"" and a deeply disappointing ending and final level. The environment design looks nice even if some assets are repeated but that is not enough to make this game enjoyable, replayable or even recommendable.			",74,12,0,23,10,0,12

												A beatiful game, to play with friends or alone. Trine seems inspired by the classic Blizzard game The Lost Vikings. Like said game, Trine is puzzle platformer in which you switch from 3 characters with unique combat and traversal skills in order to overcome many challenges. Recently Trine was updated with the engine of the sequel but you can still select which version to play when you start the game.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												Trine is basically a platformer with some minor puzzle elements. You will be jumping around on said platforms quite a lot, but instead of having just one character, you have three, which you can change on the fly (unless one or more of them died) and also has his own set of skills. The mage can conjure crates, planks and a floaty triangle thingies, the thief has a grappling hook and a bow and the knight is best suited for combat, but the thief is pretty much the best class, mostly because of her grappling hook, which you will most likely use extensively. It's also great to just circumvent the few ""puzzles"" you get in the game.Her bow is also a great weapon, even in close combat, unless you are overwhelmed by enemies.And now let's talk about those enemies, shall we?Skeletons. Tons of 'em. Not running around in the levels, no, they're spawning. Again and again. And that is nothing more than annoying and certainly not fun. Sometimes I've felt like in Call of Duty, when you aren't moving forwards and enemies just keep spawning and spawning...You will also encounter bats from time to time, which are also quite annoying, but at least they're not as common as those skeletons...All in all a good and quite nice looking game with some annoyances here and there.

												Trine is by far one of the coolest games I have ever played. It isn't very often I am able to complete a game but this is one had be up far past my bed time without even realizing it.This game is primarily made of the single player experience but the multiplayer is nothing to put aside as it can be just as fun to play with friends. The game does a great job mixing action with puzzle solving. Each of the three characters have their strengths and weaknesses pointed out pretty much as soon as the game begins. This allows the player(s) to easily decide how they wish to play the game. Each puzzle has the potential to be solve in many different ways so getting stuck is almost a impossible task.The only problem I has with this game is that it was too short. I find all to often that many of the games I greatly enjoyed playing end too quickly. Just playing casually, I was able to complete this game in about 8 hours. This is one of those game where I would have loved to see at least 15 hours of game play.To end the review, I will just say that the grapics are amazing even to this day. Everything about this games look and feel is amazing. I highly recommend giving it a shot.			",187,30,6,20,14,2,39

												Here's three reasons why Trine is not like other platforming games I've played before:-Characters:I usually could care less about a platforming games character, but in Trine the balance of the three characters and their unique personalities via great voice acting and unique abiliites.-Story:Most platforming games like Mario or Super Meatboy or Shank, etc etc, I couldn't even remotely tell you what the overall story was about, but Trine kept you hooked from the very start of the game and makes you develop a vested interest in how the story moves along-Artwork:most platforming games these days are trying to do a bit better in the artwork department  and the overall artwork presentation of platforming games has progressed very well in the last few years with the advent of indie games, but Trine's artwork is best described in two words:VISUALLY STUNNING!A Lack of online co-op is the only thing holding this back from being a $5 masterpiece.

												Trine is a fun 2D platformer with puzzle elements. The only problem I have with it, is that it is way too easy. There is no penalty for dying besides going back to a checkpoint and even then, enemies don't respawn. I do like this better than the sequel though. There is more gameplay and less story than Trine 2, which I prefer. If you want to play a fun game that does not take itself seriously, I would recommend it. Not a amazing game, but still good.

												Most beautiful puzzle platformer I've ever played. Damn, I love this game. Seriously. I want to hug it and kiss it, it's THAT good. The game is simple. You complete levels by solving the puzzles. And these puzzles are mostly solved using physics. Depending on the puzzle, you choose one of three characters (you can switch between them on the fly) to solve them. Along the way you battle enemies and collect orbs to level up. You can also find chests with items, so it also has an RPG element to it. A shame the game is over too soon, I really did not want it to end. So I had to replay it several times since then, which, of course, I didn't mind at all. Yes, this is a must have ! Bring on Trine 2 !! Woohooo !![Rating: 92/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Quick review:Short Verdict: One of the best games I've ever played! It's a mix of all the genres I love: RPG, puzzle, platformer, exploration, and it also has some fighting. I've loved it so much I beat it twice in a row! I started playing the Original Game (OG), which was amazing, then I moved to Enchanted Edition (EE), which was even better (if you wanna play the game just once, go for EE, although playing both might be worth, since they still feel slightly like different games). I'll definitely play Trine 2 when I have the chance! (Note: I haven't tried playing it online, so I can't comment on that)Pros: Great balanced mix of different game genres Beautiful graphics Awesome BGM Three different interchangeable characters who are likeable and have their unique set of upgradable skills 15+1 long and well-planned distinct levels with their own atmosphere and a lot of secrets to find Collectible equipment to further customize your characters Really addicting, it doesn't get old even if you're replaying a level Nice voice acting, especially the narrator's Even though the game is old, the devs are still responsive at the forums, especially after EE, I guessCons: Zoya, the Thief, is a bit overpowered I wish there was more to the story--I thought it was a bit shallow and I wanted more A bit easy for me, even on hard (haven't tried the OG-exclusive Very Hard Mode though) (OG ONLY!) Moving objects is slower than needed to be (a lot faster on EE) (OG ONLY!) Conjuring objects with the controller is a pain (improved on EE) (OG ONLY!) Bats are really annoying and seem a bit broken (they've been removed from EE)Bought on / for: Humble Store for US$ 0.99. But it's definitely worth the full price they're asking for!

												A big yes! Do buy this game and you will not regret it!While you have to solve the puzzles truly  thinking  about it, you won't be hurried. You will have to be pretty precise, especially with the wizard, but not frustratingly so. Creativity is required, and there are many ways to solve a problem.Beautiful graphics and a fary tale like narration really make this game a little gem.The only problem I found is that, if you are playing with a controller (mine is an Xbox one), the game doesn't tell you how to use the abilities of fire arrows (Y) button, titan force (left stick, tap right stick, tap again when fully charged // LT for the quick burst), and the hammer (Y again).  It really worried me for a minute.But then again, beside that it's truly, absolutely, completely worth it. Can't wait to play the second!			",14,2,0,1,0,0,0

												There are many things that can be said about the, ""Trinelogy"". For starters, the graphics are pretty good. The puzzles on their own aren't necessarily the hardest thing to get by, however they're still very fun. The characters aren't necessarily the most well balanced, as there is a certain one of the 3 that can be pretty bad *cough the knight cough*.  The narrator fits the tone of the game quite well which also makes it fairly entertaining. This game also has the very elusive Box Wizard! Yes, you heard it here first folks, there is a Box Wizard. He is a professional Boxer in a sense that he can summon boxes! He can also summon some other stuff, but who cares about that when you have freaking boxes?!?!The story of the game is also pretty enjoyable, making it a great game to unwind to. So, if you want to adventure as a Thief, Knight, and a Box Wizard, the Trine series is perfect for you. If you're not sure if you want to get into this game, I'd still give it a go, you never know, you might enjoy crushing your enemies under some boxes.Side note, this game is so awesome that it thanked coffee in the end credits!

												This game is great for one or maybe two evenings with your friends. I only recommend playing it with two friends locally because alone it is just a wild switching of characters. The fun comes if you can't switch on the most useful character at the time. So you get to think.Even funny if you play with drunk people although I mostly feel annoyed by them.Still waiting for my two mates to get another session, since we just got to the second to last stage.

												I highly recommend this game to everyone. As everyone knows, I like to get the flaws out in the open early. The story in this game is poor and barebones. The game is also short, as can be done in 3-4 hours. But both of this are somewhat acceptable because it is just a downloadable game that was short for $15 on release. There is a lack of variety in level design and puzzles. Besides the final level, most of the levels feel the same and after a while it might feel somewhat repetitive. If you play in short bursts it remedies this. A huge problem is that even though there are checkpoints in the levels, it will not save your progress if you exit the game. This is a problem because for a casual game, being forced to beat each level is annoying. There are only a few spells per character. Also, the thief is barely used as she is impractical. The wizard should also have an offensive spell. All that being said, it is still a surprise treat of a game.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

No, I'm writing this review because so many developers seem to be bent on cutting their game into pieces before release and selling everything to you through microtransactions and DLC.And on the other hand you have developers like Frozenbyte who update their games with worthwhile DLC and free DLC.

												Blah, blah, blah, that describes the story, the gameplay and the difficulty. Puzzles, if you want to call them that, to get experience, boil down to draw something out with the mage and then push it off the hard to reach ledge to the ground. Combat, get the warrior and just charge mashing the attack button. Platforming, why even do it when the mage can just walk across everything with even the fainest amount of intuition.The auxilaries to what this type of game is about, meaning graphics and soundtrack, are good. Not good enough to save this abysmal experience. You can just pass by this for something that does this gameplay sytle properly.			",64,14,0,12,10,0,11

												Trine is a delightfully charming platformer that is fun to play both by yourself and with others. Both playthroughs I enjoyed.Pros:- Absolutely gorgeous world! The colors are amazing, everything looks crisp, and the whole game looked mystical. - I like the switching through characters. Every character has his or her own abilities, and they are all distinct. Playing as each character is a different experience and way of getting from A to B.- Solid character controlling for the most part. I appreciate any side scrolling game with a good idea on how jumping and moving around should feel. No awkwardness here.- Playing this game made me happy. I don't know how else to explain it.Cons:- Sometimes the game would freeze. That's never fun.- The drawing button for the wizard and the move objects button should be different! Ahh! The only button mapping that bugged me.- The segments at the beginning of the levels are dumb. You stare at a map while you wait for the narrator to finish speaking. Very rarely do narrators in a video game work.- Come to think of it, the voice acting in general was meh.- Was that even a story?- What is the point of mana? The meter would decrease but never enough to make me think ""man I wish I had more mana"" because there are checkpoints frequently.- I wish it was longer!  One playthrough lasts about 4 hours or so, longer if you want to level all the way up.The downsides for Trine are definitely there, but they weren't significant enough to make me dislike this game or not want to play anymore. Trine is worth it for the stunning visuals and the fun gameplay with friends I'd say. I never played this game thinking eek when is this going to end. I didn't want it to end!There are no jump scares, only pretty things to look at.			",134,159,1,10,4,0,9

												Played plenty of this offline. The enchanted edition updates the visuals of an already delightful platformer. If you like platformers and like the look of the gameplay from trailers - you won't be disappointed by this game. It's not necessarily the most hardcore or involving affair - even on the max difficulties, and the narrative isn't terribly compelling, but it is pleasant - whimsical - and beautiful. A perfect game if you just need to relax and feel like you're in some fantasy world. The soundtrack is superb. Would give it two thumbs up if I could.			",121,54,0,22,12,0,31

												One of the best Co-op platformer I have played :D Solo, and Co-op experience can be very different. Soloing will be 1 hero, but switching between Knight, Thief, and Wizard. Each has his/her own abilities, that will help you through the level. Basically, you utilized what you had to accomplish the goal. However, Co-op will change your playstyle completely, since it is 3 heroes mode, so each hero's abilities can be combine to bypass..(cough) I mean to pass through the level. Found a gap, with some danger below? why not use the ""Rocket Knight Express"" to cross it :D			",539,88,20,74,40,1,60

												Relaxing, easy to get into and very fluently working platform/physics-puzzler. Gorgeous, colorful background/art design (it's a really great looking game). Not very difficult, but there are a few more tricky obstacles. You control one out of three, instantly switchable characters with different abilities to navigate the levels, manipulate it's objects, create your own or fight enemies. These three characters have some personality, but you don't get to know much of their backgrounds and they remain stereotypes mostly:- Charming, lady-lover wizard who conjures boxes, planks and platforms. Kills enemies with physics.- Mysterious, reserved thief who uses a grappling hook to pull and swing herself around. Kills enemies with bow.- Overweight knight and wannabe hero who likes food and drinking. Uses shield to avoid damage. Kills enemies with sword.The story leaves to be desired. There is one, there is a narrator speaking before each level and the characters sometimes comment things too. But it's your generic good vs evil fantasy thing. There is a name-giving ""Trine"" artifact binding the souls of the three characters together. It sounded interesting first, but it's not worked out further, it's only a tool to give reason why these otherwise very different personalities come together for an adventure, and creates the outline of it.

												Trine is a interesting side scroller to be sure, I find the puzzles and combat in the game to be simple and fun. The environment looks nice aswell. I dont find the game to be very difficult, even on the higher difficulty levels, and in the end I think the game is pretty short. Trine has modability though, so this may help sway your decision if you are worried about getting enough bang for your buck. I would recommend Trine to anyone looking for a sidescrolling puzzle/ action game.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												Trine proves that if you have an original mix of ideas, even old school gameplay can still work great, especially when paired with incredible visuals and extremely polished code. So, it is a bit short and lacks long-term replayability and gets scored accordingly, but don't let that stop you - Trine is definitely something special.			",236,53,9,17,11,0,18

 Hey folks,So I bought this game recently on sale for 85% off or something, and it was on my Wishlist and I'm glad I got it. I'd've easily paid full price for this. This game is good to play for a few minutes or as long as you want and with the ability to Save the game and pick it off where you left off is a plus.Pros:The graphics are pretty good and the environments are very impressive.The mehchanics in this game are easy to learn.Each level allows for many different ways in which it can be solved using each of the heroes abilities to make it happen, I favour the wizard.The game loads very quickly so that you're ready to play in no time.The abilities available in this game are simple and effective.Cons:There are honestly no Cons I can think of at this time. This could change over time, of course.I also managed to buy Trine 2 when it was on sale around the same time and am already looking forward to playing it. Would certainly recommend this to people who enjoy simple side-scrollers without the pressure to get through an entire level in such a short time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh wow, another physics-based puzzle/platformer you say.  Yeah, there's a million other competent games is this vein but I found Trine to be one of the better one I've played.  Most notably, the graphics are quite nice and each stage feels like it's own thing despite many using the same means of solving puzzles.The story is completely throwaway and the character quips at the start of levels are generic, but neither get in the way of the gameplay.  Combat variety is extremely limited but I didn't have a problem with it because I had more fun just looking around the levels for hidden stuff and solving puzzles than engaging in combat.As a bonus, the devs are updating the game with the Trine 2 engine, so in the near future, you'll be able to play the game with both engines.  The update is free and I have a lot of respect for a dev team to take the time do this for a game that is quite a few years old.  Trine is also ridiculously cheap and on sale all the time.  There's no reason to pass this game up.			",819,341,18,129,81,12,101

												It's been almost two years since I played the sequel (Trine 2) to this game (Trine).  But, when I saw they had updated Trine to the Trine Enchanted Edition by porting it to the same engine used in Trine 2, I jumped at the chance to buy it.  I'm very pleased.  Just like Trine 2, the graphics, sound, and game play are all excellent.  The amazing thing about my liking this game is that I pretty much hate platforming games.  Yet, this is, indeed, a side-scrolling platformer.  The difference is that Trine (and Trine 2) aren't ""twitch"" based platformers.  In general, you have plenty of time to examine the area and can consider the platforming aspect to be part of the puzzle solving aspect of the game.  My only serious complaint with the game is that the last level (and the hidden level that unlocks after you finish that last level) is pure, twitchy, time-limited platforming.  It's frustrating.  But, considering that this is just one level (or two, if you count the bonus level) out of 16, I can live with it.  Plus, considering that I got a tad more than 20 hours of really fun gameplay (getting to that 100% Achiement level), I'd say Trine is definitely worth the price.			",77,70,0,12,8,0,3

Puzzles wern't super hard but it made you think.Trine is a action puzzle adventure game set with 3 heros that you can switch on the fly., I give the remake a 8/10 I had fun with it, they did a good job remaking it.

This means that the wiz can only do so much in between checkpoints, you have to manage your abilities. In trine 2 you can just go ham.Trine 1 was also much shorter than trine 2, but regardless I would recommend you get it if it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Remember ""The Lost Vikings"" from 1992?  By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, ""Rock 'n Roll Racing""?No?  Where you alive back then?  If not, then you have a temporary excuse.  Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine.  If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of ""The Lost Vikings"", and play it through to the end.  If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of ""The Lost Vikings"" for your eighth birthday.  Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses.  Go.  When you're done playing through the game, come back.  I'll be waiting.If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person.  That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance.  You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.Alright.  Done playing through ""The Lost Vikings""?  ""Trine"" is a lot like that.  Slightly different abilities for your ""Vikings"", and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea.  Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).What, never heard of worm-jumping?  Were you alive/competent in 1997?  See the above paragraphs, and replace ""The Lost Vikings"" with ""Worms 2"".  You'll thank me.			",96,27,0,12,9,2,17

												First of all I start of by saying, this game felt so great to me I had to get all the achievements and try everything out. I did it, and boy would I do it again. If you want an atmospheric platformer with puzzle elements this is the game for you. Not only because the game is just something you should've played. It's also a bit different than your normal platformer. Because you can switch between 3 different characters while playing with a simple push on the button. A warrior, who is strong and fierce, a mage who can't cast a fireball, and a ninja-like archer. + Character switching feels quick+ The level design is amazing+ The story is alright, but the narrating is done much better+ The various abilities keep the game fun+ Doesn't feel liniair- Terrible controller controls / Magician not playable I definitly recommend getting Trine. Besides it's on sale alot. And in my opinion it's worth it's full price.			",219,62,4,17,22,5,23

												It is a very beutiful game that features a lot of jumping around on platforms while doing things like shooting ropes, avoid traps and fighting monsters.  Unfortunatly I am not very good at these kinds of games and found it very furstrating.  If you like that kind of game and would also like a puzzle element then I would reccomend this game for you.  If you are not so much into the dexterous manipulation of a character on moving platforms over pits of death (or exreme damage), then stay away from this game.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												It's been almost two years since I played the sequel (Trine 2) to this game (Trine).  But, when I saw they had updated Trine to the Trine Enchanted Edition by porting it to the same engine used in Trine 2, I jumped at the chance to buy it.  I'm very pleased.  Just like Trine 2, the graphics, sound, and game play are all excellent.  The amazing thing about my liking this game is that I pretty much hate platforming games.  Yet, this is, indeed, a side-scrolling platformer.  The difference is that Trine (and Trine 2) aren't ""twitch"" based platformers.  In general, you have plenty of time to examine the area and can consider the platforming aspect to be part of the puzzle solving aspect of the game.  My only serious complaint with the game is that the last level (and the hidden level that unlocks after you finish that last level) is pure, twitchy, time-limited platforming.  It's frustrating.  But, considering that this is just one level (or two, if you count the bonus level) out of 16, I can live with it.  Plus, considering that I got a tad more than 20 hours of really fun gameplay (getting to that 100% Achiement level), I'd say Trine is definitely worth the price.			",77,70,0,12,8,0,3

												Remember ""The Lost Vikings"" from 1992?  By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, ""Rock 'n Roll Racing""?No?  Where you alive back then?  If not, then you have a temporary excuse.  Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine.  If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of ""The Lost Vikings"", and play it through to the end.  If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of ""The Lost Vikings"" for your eighth birthday.  Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses.  Go.  When you're done playing through the game, come back.  I'll be waiting.If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person.  That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance.  You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox.Alright.  Done playing through ""The Lost Vikings""?  ""Trine"" is a lot like that.  Slightly different abilities for your ""Vikings"", and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea.  Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook).What, never heard of worm-jumping?  Were you alive/competent in 1997?  See the above paragraphs, and replace ""The Lost Vikings"" with ""Worms 2"".  You'll thank me.			",96,27,0,12,9,2,17

												Trine proves that if you have an original mix of ideas, even old school gameplay can still work great, especially when paired with incredible visuals and extremely polished code. So, it is a bit short and lacks long-term replayability and gets scored accordingly, but don't let that stop you - Trine is definitely something special.			",236,53,9,17,11,0,18

												A nice, fun game for those who don't mind playing other things than shooters (I already have too many shooters on steam.... I needed something different)Pros: -not bad story -the thief <3 -interesting gameplay (if you like platformers)Cons:- if you leave the game, you must start the level from the beginning. It could have been since the last checkpoint.... Esp. since levels aren't quite short (about half hour to one hour each, i think)- not so long (about 9h)Overall: not **THE best** game out there, but recommended if you are bored of too many shooters.... at least this is different. And cheap. PS: no, I'm not very good at reviews.			",274,77,11,60,19,0,52

Puzzles wern't super hard but it made you think.Trine is a action puzzle adventure game set with 3 heros that you can switch on the fly., I give the remake a 8/10 I had fun with it, they did a good job remaking it.

												First of all I start of by saying, this game felt so great to me I had to get all the achievements and try everything out. I did it, and boy would I do it again. If you want an atmospheric platformer with puzzle elements this is the game for you. Not only because the game is just something you should've played. It's also a bit different than your normal platformer. Because you can switch between 3 different characters while playing with a simple push on the button. A warrior, who is strong and fierce, a mage who can't cast a fireball, and a ninja-like archer. + Character switching feels quick+ The level design is amazing+ The story is alright, but the narrating is done much better+ The various abilities keep the game fun+ Doesn't feel liniair- Terrible controller controls / Magician not playable I definitly recommend getting Trine. Besides it's on sale alot. And in my opinion it's worth it's full price.			",219,62,4,17,22,5,23

												Lovely game. Pleasent graphics and cute settings. There is more challenge to trine 1 than 2, because in 1 you have mana. This means that the wiz can only do so much in between checkpoints, you have to manage your abilities. In trine 2 you can just go ham.Trine 1 was also much shorter than trine 2, but regardless I would recommend you get it if it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful game Enjoyed it through and through until the crappy last levelEdit: I have decided to update a few of my reviews and give them a bit more essence  then basically the thumbs up + tiny explaination or the likejust look at the screenshots to see how good looking this game is the movement is good and the pacing also felt goodthe reason that I thought that the last level was crappy is because (SPOILER) it is a timed event with a bit of a luck system to it in that you have to outjump a rising lava flow (or something like that) and obsticals and enemies are in the way while you are trying to climb to not insta die from the lava, however I must have had the worst luck ever because time and again in different parts of the climb mid jump a randomly generated falling debri would hit me straight into the lava or the debri would land and pile up in such a way that it blocked any possible progress upwards or to the next platform that I needed to get on or having my charactor glitch into a platform after being hit by a debri and not being able to move thus dieing to rising lava flow. All in all this level took me like 13 tries to finally beat it while every other level I beat first or second time through			",179,71,1,15,14,0,21

												Bleh. It's not bad or good, it's just bleh. The story and characters are generic, the jumping is floaty, and you can easily beat the first levels in no time at all as the wizard (hence why I have such a low playtime), thus negating the other characters. The game looks beautiful and has a great soundtrack, but that's it. If as much time and heart were put in the actual game as the soundtrack, this game would be stellar.			",22,1,0,5,1,0,2

												This here is my first review, and I can wholeheartedly say that I'm glad my first review is this game. This game is, frankly, amazing. Honestly, I don't even know what makes it so good. It should just be your everyday platformer game. Jump around, try not to fall, etc. But it's not. It's so much more. The story isn't too bad, actually it's pretty good. The characters are all funny and lovable. The puzzles are fun to solve, and there are multiple ways to solve them. You could just try to jump across the gap, for example, or you could have your wizard conjure a bridge to cross. Or, you could have your thief grapple hook over the gap. The art is beautiful, just beautiful.BUY THIS GAME!			",163,84,0,34,20,0,6

												Trine is simply beautiful. But that's not the only great thing about this game. The physics engine and the ability to manipulate the objects in the game in your favor is what make this game great and worth buying. It has a balance of not being too hard but not being too easy. Only thing that's missing is Co Up, but that would be fixed in Trine 2. This gets a solid 8/10 from me.			",123,6,4,15,3,3,15

												I'm starting to think physics games are doomed to fail for either not being realistic, or being too realistic. Trine somehow manages to combine both, in the worst way.The good:-Beautiful designs and backgrounds-Decent narrative-The mix of characters sometimes work well and are all utilised in finishing levels-When the physics does work, it's very satisfyingThe bad:-The narrative is often infuriatingly interrupted by things in-game, and then not continued until the next stage-The movement of characters, enemies, and objects is all much much too sloppy and often seems like everything's on ice, and covered in oil, making precision nigh on impossible-The physics doesn't work 90% of the timeThe game is actually impressive in how annoying it is, maybe because it has so potential that it fails to harness.

												By far the best puzzle platformer game i've ever played, it's a steal for it's current price at 75% off (around 2.5€). The graphicstyle is unique and its just beautiful. Gameplay is pretty fun even if you are alone as the game is pretty addicting IMO (mostly due to the leveling system). The game is pretty hard on ""hard"" difficulty and there is also a ""very hard"" mode if you are looking for a challenge. Hours of gameplay: 20+ (If you want all the achievements).

												This is /one/ of my favourite indie games for three reasons and i'll tell you why: 1. The visuals are stunning, lovingly crafted and still look beautiful three+ years on.2. The main gameplay point, one where you play one of three characters which you can swap between seamlessly makes for some really cool basic puzzling and combat. 3. The story itself is somewhat generic fantasy but that's something that really appeals to me and pulls this off in a manner that is not too sterotypical to the point where it becomes annoying but is just cliched enough that you recognize and enjoy it.A great platformer, the high point being it's stunning visuals and rope-swinging thief character.

												At first I thought ""well, despite the cons, I paid only 1.49 for it"", but it's not fair and would sound convenient for the makers; even if it was for free I wouldn't recommend this game.The characters are too annoyingly unstable. Meaning, for example, that if the char is on the edge of a platform since few seconds, he/she may fall after a little while without pushing any button; other example is: given a distance between the point where you're at and the ledge where you have to grab on, one time he/she will grab the ledge and another time he/she wouldn't. Making you fall on an acid pit or spikes, of course.The graphis are pretty rich but the surroundings are not clear and defined. You have to put your eyes under continuous stress to keep playing, otherwise you won't distinguish the playing ground from the background.			",30,9,1,4,2,0,0

												Trine is a story-telling puzzle and platformer game that I enjoyed very much in the gameplay and coop aspect. While I want to give this game my whole-hearted recommendation, I had to hesitate because I found that the game failed in the story-telling department. The first thing you notice when you start the game is the stunningly beautiful graphics which help set up this mystical atmosphere that just makes you eager to play the game. Because of that, I also grew a high expectation from the story. Sadly, as you progress through the game you start to realise that the story is almost... non-existent, in addition to a very anti-climatic and disappointing finale. I will say though, that at least the puzzles and platforming provided a decent challenge and that it was overall a pretty fun game.So the question is, is the game worth buying? Yes, but not at the full price. It's definitely something worth trying if you like platforming and/or playing a good coop game with friends.			",247,103,4,47,13,2,32

												Interesting puzzles and good atmosphere make for a pleasant experience. I can't say too much about the story since I just couldn't get into it. The 'leveling' seems a bit slapped on and doesn't really add too much since you're effectively railroaded into it anyway; same could be said about the inventory. These things and the occasional focus on fighting things just don't seem to fit very well. Some skellie killing is all well and good, throwing a boss into a puzzle room is much fun, but the times when you're screen locked into fighting 1by1 spawning is weird for this kind of game.As for the co-op... Honestly it's way easier to do yourself. And the level doesn't change with multiple people so it's completely unnecessary to have the other person. If anything you're just slowing each other down. I would not recommend this as a good co-op for those looking for a challenging puzzle game to play together. For just horsing around, sure.Trine is not a bad game, but I wouldn't list it as the most amazing/best platformer of its time. It's interesting, a little different, and could be something to do for a little while.			",26,1,0,0,0,0,1

												Trine and Trine 2 are extremely mediocre games. They don't really excel as platformers or as puzzle games because you can just make platforms if a gap is too wide and every puzzle has too many solutions. Story also fails to engage.			",28,10,1,5,4,0,2

												There are two words to describe Trine and that is visual splendor. There are very few indie games out there that has this much color and graphical fidelity. Trine is extremely pleasing to the eyes and it perfected the fairy tale graphical style. While the graphic is magnificent, the 2D plat-forming gameplay is just average. There are virtually zero depth in puzzles and progression, basically a child can play this game and get to the end without fail. Trine excels in the mega casual plat-forming department, but if you are looking for any form of challenge at all, this is the wrong game to be buying.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												It's quite the short game, and there's already a superior sequel, but Trine is still a pretty good game.I never really played with friends, so I don't know if it's co-op is fun, but I found the platforming-puzzle solving to be pretty smart.A pretty good recomendation, you should get it along with Trine 2 though.

												When asked to describe my thoughts about Trine, only one word comes to mind.NOPE!I was shocked, literally shocked when I viewed the review of this game. One after another kept saying it is good.But it's so far from the truth.When one delves deeper into the depths of Trine one might not come back the same as he once was.Trine shares a common trait with certain platformers, for instance you must collect certain items each level to get that perfect score. Yet most levels require several playthroughs before you can finish them 100%, not that it's bad.But when you come to a certain point where you needed to jump slightly instead of running off of it, and that wasn't the first time you forgot it either, comes frustration. And as I was playing things just kept adding up.The story was pure horribleness, the attempt at humour was even worse, the wizard is the most annoying character in the game, once the thief is dead you might as well restart the level seeing as most levels requires her to finish.The items are terrible, I can't remember if I ever found something for the wizard, not that I would care to either but there's a certain principle of things.The enemies are pure moronic, they will either try to kill you with a wall between you and him. Or just casually walk off a cliff trying to get to you. Bats are only there to rid you of your health, a lazy enemy at best.This game is stupid, I don't know why nor would I be able to comprehend anyone that likes this.My joy was killed at the beginning of the game, and the horrors of 2player mode (control-wise) ensured me that I would never be playing this again.Also, why does this game have or even need 2 sequels, I can think of at least several things that could've benefited from all the money and time that went into their creation. Like planting a tree or stepping on my balls so I would've been midly distracted when hearing such news.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short verdict: a beautiful art style is not enough to make a game good.PROS:+ Beautiful art style+ CoOp (incuding local CoOp on the same screen)CONS:- Primitive, almost non-existent story- Lousy, inconvenient controls- Easy straightforward ''puzzles'', which you can easily bypass with Amadeus (the Wizard) on CoOp.- No actual final boss battle, just a sloppy cutscene after an annoying climbing stage.- Just four (?) types of enemies (3 skeleton warriors and a spider).This game is highly overrated.Overall rating: 6/10 ",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												It's too bad there's no button for ""it depends.""Trine has a few things going for it. The visuals are charming - the characters and the background have a distinctive, beautiful fantasy-world feel to them. The controls are tight - you will have a lot of fun with all 3 of your characters, playing them in 3 different ways to jump around the levels and defeat the baddies.The main downsides of this game are two. First of all, it's just not challenging. I'm not sure if this game was trying to be a puzzle platformer but it falls down on both the puzzling and the platforming. In terms of puzzles, nothing really confuses you for more than a few breaths. Exploiting the physics of the game to move around the levels is usually how it's done but gets old after awhile. The story is also lacking. It's entirely non-descript. This may be a non-issue for some, especially given the short length of the game, but along with the lack of challenge this meant it got boring by the end of my four hour playtime.If you're particularly intrigued by the concept of this game or you find a great sale, go for it! It's a fun little romp. If you're looking for a bit more depth, look elsewhere!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all i played the game on single, so I have no experience of the coop story.I got this game is some HumbleBundle, I didn't go to buy itso I have no regrets of actually getting it, but I didn't enjoy this game.The graphics look good, but I din't like the art style, everything has a ton of bloom, I felt like my retinas were burning. The jumping was normal, nothing extremly good but not horrid. It frustrated me at a times were the character did not act as I had wished for.Overall a decent game if you are into platformers (I a) I guess this game is more fun coop (only has local coop) but I wouldn't recomend buying.

												I don't understand the appeal of this game. I disliked every minute I played it. I kept wondering why I was playing and then stopped after less than an hour. I tried playing it with a friend hoping that would make it more enjoyable, but it didn't. I just don't like this game. Besides the wonky controls and the lackluster level design, I just didn't understand the point of this game. It feels like a demo for a game I wouldn't want to buy. I wish I could elaborate more and more eloquently describe what it is I dislike so much about this game, but I think it's just a bunch of little things combined with the fact that it feels like it was designed for a child to play that together make me dislike this so much.

												Starts out easy enough and fairly enjoyable.  The puzzles get slightly harder, but its fairly even through out the levels.  Then all of a sudden at the end, the puzzles get much harder, and there are unreasonable amounts of enemies.  They just spawn, and spawn, and spawn, and you have to wait until they are done before you can complete the puzzle.  Then the last level shoots the difficulty all the way up to completely insane.  I was playing medium difficulty, and after getting killed 6 times after spending 5 minutes climbing, I went down to easy mode, which didn't make much difference.  The last level would make a nun curse out loud.Other than the ridiculous difficulty ramp, the story is bland and tacked on between the levels.  The enemies are all basically the same skeleton, and are plain and boring.  You are always forced to fight them as they will aggressively chase after you, pulling off insane manoeuvres like leaping 40 feet in the air to grab the ledge you are on.Overall, the game was OK but did not live up to the hype.  Worth buying if you like side-scrollers and it is on sale.			",227,8,18,11,22,0,51

												Remarkably frustrating for such a shallow, simplistic game. Repetitive gameplay, very little challenge unless you go for the extra experience and hidden areas. Oversaturated graphics look pretty cool but can be distracting at times. Nice music. Story is generic and skeletal at best but doesn't waste your time or detract from the gameplay, and the voice acting is pretty good. Occasionally it is difficult to tell the environment apart from the background, and sometimes parts of the level obstruct the camera.Overall it's not bad; I did play it through to the end. Still, it's nothing too special, even from an indie developer. On a numeric scale I'd rate it a 3/5.			",23,8,0,0,5,0,0

												Did I really just write a whole review about what I hated about Trine, copy it to clipboard, and then accidentally lose it copying the lyrics of Supertramp's ""The Logical Song"" into a review for Chantelise?Yeah. I did.Anyway, this game starts out with the neat idea of a puzzle/adventure game - which seemed to impress a lot of people when it came out - only to stop being creative halfway through and produce a game with the audacity of a day-old gumwad. Stop playing halfway through - I guarantee you did all the enjoyable parts already, the Knight's hammer isn't even that great, and the last level is one of those pseudo-timed lava-slowly-rising dealies. The controls turn out to be too sluggish and most obstacles are better solved with methods that feel like cheating, so the whole experience sort of just falls apart and feels half lazy and half frustratingly vindictive. Sliding off♥♥♥♥♥♥into hazards that were way off screen happens way too often in the late-game.Also the characters are idiotic tropes, the narration is predictable, cheesy, pointless, and even kind of wrong in a couple points (""and then they heard his voice"" isn't really accurate if the only things he does is laugh), and the payoff at the end is just so embarassingly bad it should've been replaced with a big ""YOU WON"" sign. The graphical design is pretty nice in a lot of parts and only confuses you over what's actually something you can step on in a few parts, so that's, uh, positive. A big negative is that a lot of the music sounds like it belongs in a Geico commercial or a bad fantasy parody movie - or one of those off-budget CG movies that try to copy Dreamwork's titles to cash in on grandmas who want to buy their grandchildren a fun DVD but weren't paying enough attention to the ads. Although Netflix is picking up a lot of them now so I guess the irony factor is working out for them.Anyway, if you bought this on Humble Bundle for however close to almost free you wanted to get, fine, whatever, but probably save yourself the hassle and stop after three levels.If you bought it when it came out - thanks to your inflation of its popularity, they made a Trine 2, which I bought before actually playing through this tasteless ♥♥♥♥♥ack. So, thanks for that.			",128,18,1,10,6,2,15

												The story of this game is somewhat appealing, but the game is too lackluster to attract my interest. The fighting mechanics with the Knight (the main fighting character) are severely broken. Too many times have I just walked past a skeleton and hit the air behind him instead of turning around first. And the game itself is pretty boring, but I haven't finished.

												I feel like people are fooling themselves into liking this game based soley on the beautiful graphics and barely original gameplay. The controls are sloppy and imprecise, which is particularly egregious for a puzzle platformer, the level design is repetitive in all respects except aesthetics, and the balancing of advantages and disadvantages between the three characters is almost non-existent. The game is alright some of the time, but for the most part it just feels like an exercise in futility. It could be a whole lot better if the characters didn't move like they were permanently amped up on cocaine. Seriously why do they have to go so fast? It's the main reason the control feels so poor.Really wanted to like it but I seriously don't understand the hype. 3/10			",39,51,0,7,4,0,3

												I played the demo and I really wanted to be able to recommend this game, but I just can't, because of a stupid bug (that wasn't in the demo!) – Changing the buttons mapped to left and right does not affect the swinging of the thief. I've played a lot of games, so my fingers automatically move to my usual left and right buttons. That makes this game less like fun and more an exercise in ongoing annoyance. If you're used to using WASD to move then this won't be a problem for you, but I use ESDF. You have been warned.			",20,13,0,6,4,0,4

												Looks nice but the fact that it's physics based makes completing some of the puzzles mind numbingly irritating. Whenever you actually solve one you feel like you just glitched your way through it because the physics are so hideously bad. Might be fun with friends and if you drink enough not to care about all the hidden experience vials, but if, like me, you don't have any friends and enjoy methodically completing games 100%, don't even bother. You'll waste a couple of days swinging around on the Thief's grappling hook before punching a hole in your screen and writing a surly negative review.			",318,44,6,27,23,3,42

												This game is gorgeous, and also the core gameplay design is highly effective. You can switch the 3 characters at any given time if you are required to progress further in a level. The puzzles are also interesting. But my problem is that they treat you as if you were a kid. Is this game made for children? I don't think so. But when you play it, you feel like a child. And I mean that in a negative way. Nowadays, such platform and puzzle games are usually serious and hard to complete. But this one... it cannot be taken seriously, no way. And it isn't funny either. It is way too easy to complete, and the storytelling is so childish that you wanna scream. It has a hype surrounding it which I cannot tolerate. Get serious people. This game is a kitsch. I'll try Trine 2, who knows... I still have some spark of interest left. Maybe part 2 will be better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll be honest, I had to force myself to beat this game. The graphics are very pretty, but everything else felt very... average. The three-character mechanic was pretty cool, but I found myself using the thief in 98% of situations unless I was forced to use another. Also, as many have said before, that last level sucks. I can't really recommend this game, unless it's on sale.			",218,43,3,23,6,2,20

												Despite the nice enviroment and graphics,the game has repetitive enemies (only skeletons and spider like creatures) and no actual bosses.The ending is also the worst part.I feel like i wasted so much time playing this game.The developers could definitely do a better job.

												Bought this since it was a good game when it released. But now it just wont run, the launcher opens ok but when i hit start the launcher closes and game wont start. I can see trine 32bit running in task manager. I tried turning off my f-secure and it didnt do anything. Also tried re-installing. Same thing happens with Trine 2. The launcher closes but game never shows up. After the launch when i kill the process from task manager i check game cache integrity it shows 1 file not passing and it fixes it and still it does the same every time i try launching the game. Im running windows 8.1 with all drivers up to date. And all other computer specs are more than enough to run the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not really have a longwinded review for this game (like I do for many others). At its core:+ The graphics are really good and the levels look nice.+ The music, SFX, and dialog sound pretty good overall.+ The characters are somewhat funny.+ The idea/mechanics of the game are interesting, but...- They are executed poorly, in my opinion. Many others would disagree, but this is the biggest point of the game to me. I got severely bored only after 1 hour of play and I was quite happy to get done with the game. I mean no disrespect to the creators, but it just did not click with me. It was mostly repetitive and stale.Others would presumably disagree.			",159,61,0,14,6,1,6

												Oh god, Trine is one of the most boring and monotonous games I've ever played. It really doesn't get much more trivial than this for a platformer, even Super Mario Bros. has more variety and little unnecessary filler.The AI is dumb and will constantly fall off ledges and jump back up, only to fall off again. Weapons are slow and inaccurate, the wizard's conjuration ability requires such precision that it becomes useless in any combat situation. Also, why can't I jump and fire arrows or use my conjuration spells in the air? Stupid limitations.The premise is interesting, the Trine mechanics are innovative, albeit contrived. The story is lacklustre. The narration during the loading screens is so slow and fragmented that I can't be bothered waiting to hear what's being told.The levels are all too similar in layout and lack inspiration. The puzzle mechanics aren't challenging and are too predictable, they seem to be the only reason for the physics engine to exist in the first place.Co-op is almost unplayable and seemed tacked on ""just because"" as both players control one of three characters, but only have access to two of the characters at a time, which slows down gameplay considerably. It also doesn't make sense in context with the Trine itself. The option for three player co-op is there but I'm not certain many people would be able to take advantage of this on PC.

												Personally, I would wait for this game to go on sale after playing through the entire thing. I appreciate what they were trying to do, but with infinite enemies appearing out of thin air in difficult areas, to me it stressed me out way too much. If you take your time with this game, you will have fun. But there can be points where it gets to be too much and you just want to get to the next level. Once you feel this way, the game becomes a hassle. The sequel is much, much better because it addresses pretty much every issue with the game. Brief review for this, I know, but I can't bring myself to dedicate too much more time to anything related to this garbage game.			",135,15,3,13,1,0,11

												Game looks nice and all but gets boring very quickly. Lack of enemy variety, bosses are reused several times, last level is in completely different pace to the whole game and brought only annoyance and anger. Yes, obstacles can be solved in different ways but those are immediately obvious. Would only recommend at 75% discounts if you have nothing else to play.			",99,17,1,10,12,0,17

												Mediocre.This game seems to suffer from an identity crisis? What is it? Quoting the manual, ""Trine is a great platformer game for the modern era infused with action and puzzle elements""Well, I'm afraid it doesn't do any of these particularly well.The jumping is sloppy, and you never really feel confident in landing in any particular spot. The game's physics are sloppy. Very frequently I found myself trying to ""brute force"" my way through jumps, especially when landing on platforms which are affected by the mass upon them (such as beams which pivot around their centre).The puzzles are based on the physics engine, and quite often involve using the Wizard to move/create blocks and planks to get somewhere. However, this is often sloppy. It feels more like you're 'guiding' blocks around, careful not to knock down any towers you have built to get anywhere, as the thing you are dragging rotates unpredictably, rather than firmly dragging them around. I suppose it fits thematically, as it is telekenesis, but from a gameplay point of view, the player doesn't feel in control. Furthermore, it usually takes a few tries to create what you want, particularly with the square blocks or triangular floating platforms (which rotate and are very unstable)Combat is plain awful. There are four main enemy types in the game, and they're all skeletons with varying abilities. You'll be seeing them throughout the whole game. What's worse is that they just keep spawning. One can spend several minutes just whacking them, as more keep spawning in, with no indication on how long until they stop spawning. You don't have a very varied move set either. It's either hold up your shield and wait for an opening with the knight, shoot an arrow at them with the theif (who cannot fire in mid-air) or hit them with a heavy object, usually with the wizard (who can't move when creating objects/using telekenesis). Enemy AI is also poor, trying to scramble over ledges, waves of monsters continually walking into a situation where they crush themselves. I admit, I played this on easy, but as far as I'm aware it only changes damage given and taken, rather than gameplay or AI.So, to give some positives, the environments are very detailed, music is fine, dialogue has some witty moments, even if the story is unmemorable.

												Here's the thing: I liked this game, but I couldn't wait to finish it. I enjoyed playing it, but I know I won't ever play it again. The graphics were great, gameplay was fluid, and the three characters you utilize are all diverse enough to give everyone their own style. But for some reason, The only reason I played this game -- and continued playing it to the end -- was to get it off my ""not completed"" list. I felt no push to find out what happened next, or get all the achievements, or even explore. I got the whole thing done in maybe three or four hours, and I don't imagine myself playing it any more.

												Trine is a great game. Lots of fun to play with a friend on your couch. Grafix are awesome, soundtracks matches the style and riddling together how to solve the levels is great.So why don't recommend the game? We just tried the last level and it has everything to kill all the fun you had before:You have to jump up a tower under time pressure as lava is rising from the ground. It's hard to not play it alone as you need to switch characters quickly. And an evil guy is conjuring items like boxes and planks right in your face. So three bad things you never got trained in all the levels before. I cannot understand how to do such a bad game design.It's a real pity, but I cannot recommend the game to anybody who doesn't like hardcore game difficulty changes. :[ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine is an action/puzzle platformer with 3 types of heroes, 2 types of bosses and 1 type of level.The graphics are pretty gorgeous, but unfortunately for the gameplay it's not great. There is quite a mess on screen and it's sometimes hard to tell a bonus pickup from an enemy attack.The controls - which should be the most important thing for a platformers - don't allow for enough precision and feel sloppy, which will often trigger misses. Not that it matters because the game is too easy anyway.All the levels feel exactly the same, beyond level 1 there is hardly any new mechanics, from there it's just grinding your way through. The fixed camera placement is annoying. You know objects are there but the camera won't budge or allow you to place objects outside the current field of vision.There are just 2 bosses, they're not epic, just merely a slightly tougher foe, and they come back several times in later levels.Not much variety in enemies either, it's just the same skeletons from the beginning to the end.All in all, this is just like playing the same level 15 times over again, with a different backdrop.I can appreciate some may be drawn by the medieval fantasy storytelling or by the luxurious backdrops. The graphics got overhauled recently with the enchanted edition and it's quite superb. One can wish the gameplay had got improved instead!			",309,115,5,41,72,1,62

												This game is terribleThe music and setting is cliched and forgettable, the plot is a joke, the only two bosses are rehashed several times and are almost identical, there's no final boss, every level and challenge is the same, casting shape spells as a wizard is unweildy (you couldn't have just allocated a shape to a unique button?). Combat is a laugh, mash the trigger button to win, every enemy is the same skeleton (spooky), the game throws an absurd number of enemies at me to complely ignore and jump over. The checkpoints enable you to cheese the game way to easily, which is kind of necessary since once your warrior dies you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck.I could go on forever about how the last two and a half hours I marathoned this game were some of the most miserable, tedious, worthless hours of my life but I'd rather pool my resources into getting past this game and hopefully enjoy the next one.

												 Trine is a 2-d platform game with some puzzle elements. The key mechanic is that you can switch between three characters which have different abilities. A lot of the puzzles require swinging, putting weights on seesaws, pushing objects, moving objects with telekenesis, cutting ropes with arrows, etc. Each puzzle can be solved in a variety of different ways. Some puzzles can be solved with all three characters, so there is some replayability to try to go back and retry a puzzle with a different character. In general the puzzles were not very hard, but some of them are very creative and fun. Combat was a little dull since there are only two kinds of regular enemies and two kinds of boss. I got this game for a very good price and it was well worth it. It is a nice diversion, fun enough to hold your attention, not so difficult that you get frustrated. I would not pay more than five bucks for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this when it was on sale for about a dollar so I didn't expect much of it. Instead, what I got was one heck of a puzzle platformer that's simply drop-dead gorgeous. The game itself is simple enough for anyone to pick-up but the platforming and puzzles later on can be very challenging but the feeling of satisfaction you get from finishing those puzzle-platforming sections is just bliss.The way the game is presented is very much like a story-book with the narrator, the cutscenes and those amazing setpieces. You can seriously take a screenshot of any section of this game and it'd look like a painting worth being framed and hung on someone's lounge room!In single player, you can play as one character, either as the mage, the thief or the knight; each with their own strengths and weaknesses and you are allowed to switch as whichever character you want in order to get through a particular puzzle or platforming section. For example, the mage can conjure boxes and platforms to help you with puzzles and getting to places but is pretty useless when it comes to battle while the knight can lift heavy objects and is the main fighting force when it comes to battles. This interesting mechanic has been implemented extremely well within each level as you will be encouraged to play as all of the different classes in order to get through it and that makes for an already enjoyable game all the more enjoyable!All in all, Trine is an amazing-looking game with fantastic gameplay to boot and if it ever goes on sale again, don't hesitate and dive right in!

												At first I thought this game would turn out to be yet another standard RPG game... The moment I started the game I was immediately proven wrong.This game takes what we love about platformers, puzzlers and RPGs and blends them into a melting pot of awesomeness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Trine""This has been the most suprising game that i have played in quite some time.I often remember those times where game developers still put gamplay on first priority and graphics second. Games that were Epic for their time, remember games like GODS on DOS, Shadow of Memories on Windows 95, games like that! games that sucked you right in and made you not even notice the minor downsides.Trine is that game this time, it offers a good old fashion platform type of gameplay with some new twists, a good old fashion story, and wonderfull graphics of this generation.Just buy the game its worth every penny :-) and then some.

												Trine is a fairytale game; it's beautiful, it has good and evil characters, and involves a fair amount of magic. In-game there are lots of enemies and  little puzzles to get through, and you can switch between the knight, magician and thief whenever you feel the need. Each have their abilities- there are several ways to get through a level! The game is played from left to right, sidescroll. very enjoyable, but a tad short. :)Definitely worth my money.

												I bought this on a whim a while back and it quickly became one of my favourites.  I can't point out something I don't like about Trine.  The music is fantastic and fits perfectly with every level, the graphics are clean and look great, the physics and combat are smooth, and the environments are stunning.  The three playable characters make up a rather usual tank/rogue/mage adventuring party and, among the hordes of similar parties in other games, still manage to be memorable and entertaining.If you're a fan of fantasy games and platformers, I can't recommend Trine enough.

												 Trine is a 2-d platform game with some puzzle elements. The key mechanic is that you can switch between three characters which have different abilities. A lot of the puzzles require swinging, putting weights on seesaws, pushing objects, moving objects with telekenesis, cutting ropes with arrows, etc. Each puzzle can be solved in a variety of different ways. Some puzzles can be solved with all three characters, so there is some replayability to try to go back and retry a puzzle with a different character. In general the puzzles were not very hard, but some of them are very creative and fun. Combat was a little dull since there are only two kinds of regular enemies and two kinds of boss. I got this game for a very good price and it was well worth it. It is a nice diversion, fun enough to hold your attention, not so difficult that you get frustrated. I would not pay more than five bucks for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having recently completed the story for this game, I think it's safe to say that I can't wait to start the second one. Trine brings you a combination of puzzle,platforming and minor leveling up elements. You cycle between 3 characters, each with different abilities to help you progress through the various puzzles and enemies you'll face. The scenary is beautiful, the physics are percise. The story is a little basic but none the less immersive. Extra elements such as leveling skills, finding items and secrets and rerunning the game on higher difficult settings does not just limit trine to a single playthrough. It helps to add longevity to a game that, in reality, will take you under 6 hours to complete (but when I say complete, I do not me fully!) 8/10			",178,30,1,24,11,1,32

												Your typical side-scroller with a few additions thrown in to mix things up. In Trine, you may control one of three characters (switching between them in single player or playing as all 3 on local coop). Using each character's unique abilities, you must triumph over the undead and reclaim your lost kingdom. Despite it being an old fashioned side scroller with very few twists, its major attraction (at least in my personal opinion) is its soundtrack. A game is great, don't get me wrong. But the cherry on top is listening to the beautiful melodies of the orchestra serenading you as you make your way to the end of every level. If side-scrollers aren't your thing, then at least take a listen at the soundtrack. I assure you, you won't regret it.Grade: B+			",954,269,33,116,84,11,129

												A very short game, but thoroughly enjoyable and refreshingly challenging. The scenery in this game is stunning, the narrative is enough to keep you going. The only negatives that I felt through playing this game was that the gameplay was quite shallow; I was pretty much doing the same thing from the first to the last level. I didn't go back and get every little bottle of experience in every level, in fairness. Also, the bats in this game are infuriatingly annoying. Overall, a definite recommendation, especially when it is at such a low price at the moment.			",64,15,0,26,8,0,5

												When I got in on sale, then played it for the first time, I knew I had struck gold. I would have gladly paid the full price had I know how amazing this game was. This is very reminicent of the old SNES game Lost Vikings, but it is so much more. Platforming, physics, and a casual item collection process that allows you to saunter through, but will have you go back to complete.Brief Overview: Kingdom is in trouble, but you find yourself(selves) trapped together a Mage, a Thief, and a Knight. The Mage can create and levitate objects; the Thief has a grappling hook and a bow; the Knight can block anything with his sheild and deals out massive damage.Why have you not purchased this yet? 10/10			",348,86,0,92,48,1,94

												A very fun platformer-type game. You basically switch between 3 characters each with their own skills. As you progress you unlock various items and abilities. Even on Medium difficulty you are probably going to die a bit. My only complaint is that I was unable to stop playing til i got through the entire story. As soon as you beat a level it automatically loads the next one. Meaning the only way out is to press ESC and Quit. It made it very hard to stop playing such an awesome game haha.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An innovative puzzle-platformer with beautiful scenescapes and occassional whimsical humor to compliment its hack-and-slash action. The RPG-elements and strong-narrative keep this game interesting up until the very end. Would highly recommend.			",346,137,2,33,28,2,29

												This is 1 of the best action/ RPG type games I have played in years. It has a little of everything: adventure, puzzles and you switch between 3 seperate class types depending on what you need to accomplish. I highly suggest this game. The gameplay is really fun and holds your attention and the game looks amazing.			",178,24,5,32,14,2,21

												For the most part it's just like every other platformer, but the beautiful graphics appealed to me enough to keep playing.  The main game mechanic of switching between three characters with different skills works well, and this ends up being a really solid fun-to-play platformer.			",132,99,0,41,12,2,23

												If you're anything like me in RPG games and can't choose between playing a thief, a wizard, or a fighter; then you'll enjoy this game. I just got this game on super sale ($0.99 alone or $5.24 for four different games!) Even if it weren't that great, if it entertains me for more than an hour, I would have called it a good deal; but it DOES entertain as if I had spent ten times the amount I paid. Besides just being PURTY to look at, it's unique gameplay is fresh and fun. You bounce around between the three classes to solve the puzzle like level, while also hacking and slashing the baddies. It's like a light version of an ARPG and puzzle solving game in one. If you get this on sale, it's very much worth the buy.			",12,1,0,7,2,0,2

												Platforming with side perspective results in beautiful backgrounds at all time, in addition to elegantly subtle transition from darkness to light and so on as story progresses.Humorous narrative and good voice actors give giggles.Gaming atmosphere transforms from relaxing to intense as difficulty increases (manually set by the players), yet they are all equally enjoyable.And very importantly, brilliantly good soundtrack from the independent composer Ari Pulkkinen :D Much suited to the mood (in every level).Totally recommended.

												Gorgeous graphics and an air of amusement are defintiely this game's strengths. On top of that, playing co-op with a friend is incredibly fun, and I'd suggest dedicating one whole runthrough to that alone. The levels have a lot to explore, to the point where I was going mad trying to find every nook and cranny. I only feel bad for using the wizard to conjure boxes for a lot of parts.. kind of a shame that it's possible to break intended solutions with boxes and more boxes; but that would be my only complaint. But it's easily worth more than every penny of the $5 it currently costs!			",115,24,2,15,13,0,15

Trying to reach things and solve puzzles is quite open, there are no boundaries restricting your use of abilities and imagination, which is refreshing. Its only flaw is that its very short - but it has great replay value through playing on harder modes and finding all the secrets, and its fairly cheap so its a good buy.			",180,23,2,39,6,0,28

The final sequence was also a bit questionable, although the game overall is still well worth your time.			",216,26,2,29,13,0,36

												Trine is a highly enjoyable, fantastically beautiful puzzle/platformer.  The difficulty is challenging enough to be interesting and rewarding, with multiple solutions for most of the obsticles.  The story is amusing enough threading the levels together, but isn't likely to ""wow"" you.  (I will echo another review saying that you may want to wait for it to drop in price.  I purchased it during the Summer Sale, heavily discounted.)Ultimately, it's the gameplay that will capture your interest--and a good thing, too, 'cause it's a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It provides an excellent gameplay experience. The use of physics, whether through puzzles alone, or the wizzard's conjured boxes, planks, and floating platforms is exceptionally good, and quite unique.			",172,29,4,4,19,0,43

												This is a fun and beautiful game. I liked the fact that the puzzles didn't have only one possible solution - if you can't figure out the nice and clean path, you'll most likely be able to make your own ugly dirty one and continue your journey.The only downside to the game is the saving system: you can only save after completing an entire chapter; checkpoints do nothing to this matter (this was changed for Trine 2, yay!).

												Trine and Trine 2 are lovely looking funny platform games that should be played with two or three friends or random strangers at home or online! I recommend that you talk to the random strangers before you invite them into your house, though. Trine isn't quite as good as Trine 2, though, but absolutely worth a playthrough with friends.Although it's a different game, I would say that Lost Vikings finally has a worthy successor!

												This game is simple,fun and relaxing.The graphics are great to look at and sometimes you will end up just admiring the level before you move on.The fighting mechanics are simple,you can attack and you can block.At some points it will get more challenging but I can't say that the game is hard because of the foes you will be faced with.The boss battles are well designed and the soundtrack is amazing.Trine is a unique game because you have so many ways of clearing a level.You can be a Mage that manipulates and creates objects.You can be a Thief,agile and fast with a bow.Or you can be a Warrior,strong and bulky.Overall I enjoyed the game,it's a game that you can play if you want to relax and have a good time.The storyline is satisfying and the level design and soundtrack alone can make you want to play the game at least for a few minutes.

Only ran into one bug but have little complaints due the the beauty of the settling of this game.

												TRINE! let me start off by saying i bought this game for only 99 cents... and Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was it worth it.. hours and hours and hours of fun for only a dollar? sign me up.The good- This game is not the shortest game took me roughly 13 hours to complete or hard, fighting was fun visuals were amazing, okay story very basic but fitting for the story book fantasy feel. I HIGHLY recomend it to anybody that wants a good game at a budget, i have not played co-op but i bet it is a blast The bad- Low variety of enemys, only two. Skelaton and a bat lol.. The bosses ( if you would like to call them that) well there is only two bosses used throughout the game. puzzles were easy( more like roadblocks but did find it fun to figure out how to get past it very rewardingFinal verdict- BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												(somewhat rushed for Summer Sale Cheevo's) I truly dig the twee vibe you may well get from the screen shots. It can get more complicated than that (platform creating, ninja roping) and theres a lot of clever stuff the game does do and that you can do, but theres no need to if you'd prefer to clumsily muddle through and see the lovingly created settings, that's fine too. The baddies (and that's as near as damn singular) do get tiresome and do seem to be there to lengthen the campaign without stopping you, but all the same the design just work perfect for me, give it a look.

												[PRO]If you like The Lost Vikings probably you will like Trine, the system is very similar.Characters:-	The Thief is a versatile char, very agile, she use the grappling rope and bow and arrow, if you combine certain items and skills the Thief can turn the most powerful char, firing 4 deadly arrows-	The Warrior is pure “hack n’ slack”, he use the sword, shield and a hammer, with sword you can destroy many things and with hammer you can crush everything-	The Wizard is your life-saver, he create boxes, planks, floating triangles and move things with telekinesis, if you use smart the Wizard, you can save your life (cover the spikes with boxes) and get many items, if you get in troubles with the monsters you can drop the box in their headsDifficulty:-	Is very balanced!

This game has separate selection for audio language and text language so it's excellent - you can set one of them in the language you're learning to get some exposure while still understanding what's happening. But even if you won't understand everything you won't lose much, story is not the main focus here and controls are intuitive. Plus, it's a fun game.			",697,251,17,105,68,7,156

												A beatiful game with scenes that look like it came right out of storybook fantasy.  Each character perfectly fits a purpose and although I haven't tried cooperative play with this I'm sure it would be just as great.The finale though brings back memories of old side scrolling games where the big boss presents a sudden spike in the difficulty curve.  While you've been breezing along level after level, you suddenly come up to a point where the game tells you ""Where do you think you're going?""  You'll get it done after a couple of tries though.Completed in 9.1 hours.			",207,42,7,17,10,3,36

												Trine is a simple platformer that has beautiful graphics and a wonderful soundtrack. The premise involves utilising all three characters, whose souls have been connected, to solve the puzzles and kill enemies to advance through the levels to rid the kingdom of evil. There are experience bottles and items along the way that will help you become more skilled and powerful. My only concern was that the ending was sort of a letdown since there was no ""final boss.""I got this in the Humble Indie Bundle and just Trine was well worth the price I paid for the whole pack.

This game can be played solo, and most of the levels have multiple ways of getting through. The level design, art and music are the games strongest points. However with the real low price tag (especially during sales), its a must have, unless you really hate platformeers. There are some balance issues with the heroes, and the controls aren't as tight as they should be, but i'm hoping they fixed that with the second one. If you still aren't sure of whether or not to pick this up, try the demo.			",265,65,5,28,12,1,28

												Delicioso artísticamente hablando, pero demasiado breve y algo repetitivo una vez superadas las primeras fases. ""Trine"" puede ser una buena alternativa para cuando queramos desconectar de títulos densos o que requieran entrenamiento constante... pero ya. Lástima, porque con algo más de trabajo podría haber sido un clarísimo sobresaliente.

												For the most part it's just like every other platformer, but the beautiful graphics appealed to me enough to keep playing.  The main game mechanic of switching between three characters with different skills works well, and this ends up being a really solid fun-to-play platformer.			",132,99,0,41,12,2,23

												Platformers? Check. Physics Puzzles? Check. Lost Vikings Flashbacks? YES!Trine is a beautiful-looking and beautifully scored game from the Finnish Frostbyte. Three generic (or are they?) classes end up touching a magical artifact known as the Trine, which binds their souls together. With clever switching of class in between finely crafted stages, each gets their chance to shine, whether it is the archery & tethering of the Thief, strength and shield-wielding of the Knight, or the conjured platforms of the Wizard. No fireballs here, but clever use of each class makes it an entertaining journey. Look into multiplayer as well! Definitely worth your time!			",271,51,4,44,15,2,51

												Imagine if Dungeons & Dragons, Portal, Super Mario Brothers 3, and Donkey Kong Country all got thrown into a blender and set to an epic orchesta score written by Harry Gregson Williams and the result would be Trine.  This is a great physics platformer with amazing detail and very fluint controls.  The story is on the level of depth as Mario (i.e. princess captured, go save) but you'll hear no complaint out of me.  Only legitimate complaint I have is the low variety of enemies but each of the 15 levels has it's own theme, background, atmosphere, and well written musical score to complete the mood of each realm you explore so you hardly notice.  The music really is so great that I have the soundtrack on my MP3 player, no joke.  The actions flow seemlessly, weapon upgrades acutally progress at the same rate as the difficulty curve, and you'll keep coming back so you can find everything.  This is the best $20 you'll spend on a game this year, promise.			",63,6,0,5,3,2,4

												Do I recommend this game? Psshhh no.... Ok. That was hard to say. Of course I recommend this game. I am not one to play platform style games... However I do love a good puzzle. This game provides not only great quick-thinking puzzles but also is the best platformer I have ever played. Yes, it is quite short time wise but who says you cant play through again on higher difficulty. If your'e not into that kind of thing... Get Trine 2. I have yet to try the second one but seeing at how impressive the first is... Trine 2 will be on my wish list. Trine is/was more than worth the 0.99$ I spent on it. It provided much more entertainment than I ever expected. It frustrated me at times but that was because I was trying to play quickly. Though this game isn't new by any means you can not really tell how old it is while playing. To be completely honest, it felt like I was playing a much more modern game. The graphics in this game aren't phenomenal but the atmosphere is. (The graphics are amazing DO NOT get me wrong). So all that said... I certainly recommend this game. I couldnt recommend it more.(BTW All you haters that choose Not To Recommend... Please do it for more of a legitimate reason than the fact that you can't get past a level)**Kudos to Frozenbyte for this outstanding game**			",152,10,3,12,14,1,9

												I bought this game for 4€ due to a steam coupon and it was totally worth it. It's a nice platforming where you can controll 3 different ""heroes"" with different abilities. What I really liked about this game was that you can solve the different puzzles on different ways according to your playstyle (mage,rogue or warrior) especially when you progress in the game and achieve more abilities.Although I liked this game, I thought it was way to easy. I played it the first time on ""medium"" and did it all on the first try (except the last level where I needed like 3 trys) and you can't really die due to the checkpoint system. Even on the difficulty ""Very Hard"" it was still very easy in my opinion but this might be due to my full-leveled heroes. The game has various achievements like exploring (finding all experience bottles in the levels) and ""fun"" achievements like jumping on 5 different skeletons; a good mix in my opinion.Finally, you can beat this game in like 7-8 hours when you play it the first time and like to explore the levels to find the experience flasks which are very nicely hidden and it's fun to explore the levels.

For a side-scrolling-platforming-puzzler it is quite the game, giving you a new sense of adventure with its epic graphics for a 2009 game, and great point-and-click gameplay. 100% Would recommend to anyone who is hesitant about it. But if it is between Trine or Trine 2, go for Trine 2. The story is pretty interesting, but you can sorta live without it.			",34,7,0,11,2,0,3

												A neat platformer. Story and characters are basic but serviceable. For the most part, the obstacles are not so large as to demand very strict usage of abilities and so you can solve them in multiple ways, which is great! The grappling hook mechanic is a lot of fun. Combat isn't immensely fleshed out but I prefer it this way, because it keeps the emphasis on the puzzle aspect and mostly makes the enemies a bit of added pressure to move around and amusing asides to watch as they suicide on level geometry.

												Beautiful little game. Had me fully engaged and struck that nice balance of being challenging enough to make you feel smart but not frustratingly difficult. It was fine single player and from what I played the local multiplayer was good too, if you get along with your co-op buddy. The combat is decent, but the heart of the game is in its platforming. I found myself playing the theif more than the other two because she could both fight and platform competently. The wizard cannot fight well, and the knight cannot platform easily without help from the wizard. While this is no good in singleplayer, it makes co op more rewarding. The game isn't particularly long, but troves of secrets and goodies plus extra challenge levels make it worth your while. Decent enough story, but like I said, this is a platformer first and foremost. Can't wait to play the second one.			",105,5,0,12,1,1,3

												Gorgeous graphics and an air of amusement are defintiely this game's strengths. On top of that, playing co-op with a friend is incredibly fun, and I'd suggest dedicating one whole runthrough to that alone. The levels have a lot to explore, to the point where I was going mad trying to find every nook and cranny. I only feel bad for using the wizard to conjure boxes for a lot of parts.. kind of a shame that it's possible to break intended solutions with boxes and more boxes; but that would be my only complaint. But it's easily worth more than every penny of the $5 it currently costs!			",115,24,2,15,13,0,15

												Trine is a great coop game. I was able to get a few non-gamers to play it due to the ability to assist your fellow player through any obstacle. It takes a little longer, but it adds a bit of challenge trying to figure out how to lead someone with very little gaming coordination through the levels. Even as a purely single player game, it is excellent.  You get a bit of that nostalgic feeling that comes with side scrolling action, but the depth of the game mechanics pushes it beyond past generations of 2d action games. I bought a package containing this and the sequel and I am super-excited to play the next one!!! BUY IT! ",308,70,8,18,19,1,16

												If you're anything like me in RPG games and can't choose between playing a thief, a wizard, or a fighter; then you'll enjoy this game. I just got this game on super sale ($0.99 alone or $5.24 for four different games!) Even if it weren't that great, if it entertains me for more than an hour, I would have called it a good deal; but it DOES entertain as if I had spent ten times the amount I paid. Besides just being PURTY to look at, it's unique gameplay is fresh and fun. You bounce around between the three classes to solve the puzzle like level, while also hacking and slashing the baddies. It's like a light version of an ARPG and puzzle solving game in one. If you get this on sale, it's very much worth the buy.			",12,1,0,7,2,0,2

												This game is addictive! The voice acting and story telling aspect of the game makes you feel like a kid again (even though the writing is horrible and unoriginal) The 3d scenery and character animation is jaw-droppingly beautiul, can stare at it for hours! My favorite part of the game is the game mechanic of being able to switch between 3 characters at all times, it really makes you think about how you can take advantage of each characters special abilities. Another thing I like is the frequent checkpoints and not feeling bad for dying.			",253,84,6,29,22,2,63

Lots of treasures to find, new weapons and such.All in all, a decent game. Worth the small price it is.Likely much more enjoyable with friends playing too.			",97,10,2,13,4,1,5

												Great game. Trine is a platforming game where you play 3 characters at the same time. At any time you can switch between the knight, thief, and wizard, all of which have extremely different abilities. You will need to keep switching between these three characters to get past any obstacles in your way. The rgaphics are great, with nice, colourful, and detailed environments. The characters are pretty jokes. Nice music too. All in all if you're looking for a great 2D platformer you got to get Trine. Looking forward to playing Trine 2.			",133,21,3,12,9,0,9

												Trine is a neat side-scroller that lets the player control three different characters at any given time.  Each character has its strenghts and weaknesses and palyers have to use all three in order to fully clear each level.  Story is nice, graphics are very pretty, and controls are fun and simple.  The game does offer a challenge as players get further into the game, and there's lots of hidden areas to find.			",655,386,8,131,129,9,122

The archer is very powerful at the same time she can jump very high and the fighter is so strong too but slower. The colours and the environtment is amazing, very fresh and few nice final details like skeletons and the big monsters. In few words this game is very worthly.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game that I'd give to anyone looking to get into games or gaming.  It's also a game that every gamer, whether you've seriously played games (or have never), or have been playing games for several years needs to play.  For the price they're asking, it will always be worth it, and it'll always be worth it to give as a gift for someone to enjoy.I didn't think that platformers could get more innovative than they were, and then I played Trine and my expectations were shattered.  I loved this game, and can't wait to break into Trine 2.  If you're on the fence, this is an absolute buy.  Every time.  I'd be thoroughly shocked if you played the entire game and was disappointed by your experience afterward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine is a side scrolling platform game in which you play three protaganists a wizard, a thief and a soldier, whose souls have somehow been gathered together by the Trine. To complete game you need to complete the levels, collecting experience to gain better weapons or skills is of use you do this be collecting bottles that are laying around or hidden, or by killing monsters and collecting the experience. Also lying around are energy bottles to top up your energy which the wizard seems to use a great deal more than the other characters (at least in the levels I have played any how.)The idea pf three souls together  has the benefit that you can swap at anytime between the different characters if one character has a skill to solve that the others do not. This makes it interesting as you move between them to complete the different levels. So soon learn which character is best for the upcoming task. For me the Graphics make it stand out, the environment is beautifully drawn which makes it a real pleasure to play. There is a great deal of jumping about and I sometimes find it hard to control using the keyboard; especially the thief when she is trying to get onto a platform from the grappling rope. I think a game controller would  make it a bit easier, I am going to try this to see if is indeed true. The default movement controls are the standard WASD controls perhaps if you wish to use the keyboard to play, redefining the keys could also improve things.Another positive aspect of the game is the narration which makes you feel you are creating the book as you go along. The music also adds to the atmosphere quite well.During the hours I've played I've lost a character because they ran out of health many, many times. If you feel you wish to start over. You can choose from the menu to either start from the last checkpoint or restart the level. Restarting from the last checkpoint doesn't reset the monsters and puzzles that you've completed whilst restarting the level does reset the puzzles and monsters. However collected experience is retained by you upon the restart so during the restart you will only see the experience you haven't collected, so far.I thoroughly recommend Trine and I will continue with Trine2 once I've completed Trine.

You switch between the characters whenever you want, and each has unique abilities. I couldn't stop playing this game until I was done after I started. Also, the graphics are beautiful.

Plus, the graphics and audio are very well done. For a game of this polish and entertainment value, I would highly recommend it.			",472,79,20,68,19,1,59

												Purchased at $5Use a controller, or two, or three, and enjoy one of the best local COOP experiences on the PC. One of the best looking sidescrollers ever made couple with some brilliant dynamic physics-based puzzles and challenges. You won't be disappointed, especially if you grab it on a Steam sale. Looking forward to the sequel, whenever I get around to it.My only gripe is with the wizard's inability to fight at all besides attempted to conjure things to drop on enemies. Seems like a huge oversight.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												Trine is a fantasy puzzle platformer where you play 3 characters (The wizard, the knight, and the thief) stuck in the same body (thus allowing you to switch between characters).  You can play single-player or online or local co-op for up to 3 players.I stopped paying attention to the story pretty quickly (which is offered in the form of narration in between levels and the occasional cutscene of still art) but I enjoyed the gameplay very much.  At times it can be a little difficult to quickly switch between characters to do tasks while fighting enemies, but it's pretty manageable.  The only spot that gave me any real trouble was the final level where you have to reach the top as rising lava fills the floor beneath you.Another thing I really liked was the save system.  You can save just about anywhere at just about any time which is perfect for quick play sessions.  I'm really looking forward to playing the sequels.			",2147,842,73,180,253,25,261

												Trine is a platformer, with a bit of puzzle solving mixed in, that brings a beautiful world to explore, enhanced by a sublime visual design. The adventure takes place in a fairytale world with a medieval atmosphere. Both voice acting and music are great. The only negative is a lack of enemy variety.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is rather generic.  It was fun enough to waste a few hours, but completely forgettable beyond that.  The story is equally generic.  The platforming is okay, but kind of clumbsy.  The final boss was a pain in the butt compared to the rest of the game.  It's really just another ""Use everyone's abillties in the correct way to get through the level"" game.The only real thing that saves it is the music and the graphics.  I give this a very ""buy it on sale"" recommendation.			",156,98,1,23,15,0,17

												Awesome platformer.  Great music, beautiful art style and great overall look and feel of the game.  I really enjoyed the mechanics and how you had to switch between the different characters (and skillsets) to get to different parts of the level.  The game is very flexible in how the levels are completed, so creativity does come into play a bit.  Loved it.			",53,30,1,5,1,0,0

												The best in the series and one of my favourite puzzle-platformers. A superb game which has consistently good level design and pacing that really differentiates it from it's competitors. A must play for fans of platformers and puzzle games alike. Soundtrack is catchy and memorable. Visuals are decent, and have aged well since this game's release. Replay value is relatively high, with cleverly placed collectibles and solid achievements. Overall, I give this game 9/10 and I only hope that after Trine 3, Frozenbyte can produce something on par with Trine.			",104,54,1,9,12,4,24

												Addictive platform/puzzle game. The bodies of a wizard, a knight and a thief get fused together and you have to control them, switching between one of the three at will, on quest to save the kingdom and separate themselves. The wizzard can move objects telekenetically and conjure platforms, boxes etc, the thief has a bow and grappling hook you can swing from and the knight is a hand-to-hand fighter. You need to collect experience vials as you go which are hidden in hard to reach places which require some thought and a combination of the character's skills to get to. Trine 2 seems to be more of the same.			",738,214,18,106,95,7,151

												Trine is a side scrolling platform game in which you play three protaganists a wizard, a thief and a soldier, whose souls have somehow been gathered together by the Trine. To complete game you need to complete the levels, collecting experience to gain better weapons or skills is of use you do this be collecting bottles that are laying around or hidden, or by killing monsters and collecting the experience. Also lying around are energy bottles to top up your energy which the wizard seems to use a great deal more than the other characters (at least in the levels I have played any how.)The idea pf three souls together  has the benefit that you can swap at anytime between the different characters if one character has a skill to solve that the others do not. This makes it interesting as you move between them to complete the different levels. So soon learn which character is best for the upcoming task. For me the Graphics make it stand out, the environment is beautifully drawn which makes it a real pleasure to play. There is a great deal of jumping about and I sometimes find it hard to control using the keyboard; especially the thief when she is trying to get onto a platform from the grappling rope. I think a game controller would  make it a bit easier, I am going to try this to see if is indeed true. The default movement controls are the standard WASD controls perhaps if you wish to use the keyboard to play, redefining the keys could also improve things.Another positive aspect of the game is the narration which makes you feel you are creating the book as you go along. The music also adds to the atmosphere quite well.During the hours I've played I've lost a character because they ran out of health many, many times. If you feel you wish to start over. You can choose from the menu to either start from the last checkpoint or restart the level. Restarting from the last checkpoint doesn't reset the monsters and puzzles that you've completed whilst restarting the level does reset the puzzles and monsters. However collected experience is retained by you upon the restart so during the restart you will only see the experience you haven't collected, so far.I thoroughly recommend Trine and I will continue with Trine2 once I've completed Trine.

												What to say about Trine...genius? perfect? Maybe. Trine is platforming at it's greatest. There is no one specific way to solve the game's puzzles. Also, the entire thing can be played 3 player co-op either online, via LAN or on the same PC provided you have some spare controllers or an extra mouse and keyboard. That's what makes Trine and Trine 2 absolute gold; working together with your friends (or hindering them) is absolutely a blast.Just go play the series with a friend or two and you'll see what I mean.

												I bought this game on sale( 1,95 euros).I want to be honest, I don't know if I would buy it with 13 euros, but this game is AWESOME!!!! Easy to control the players who have different abilities(in my opinion it is better with a controller), nice colours, interesting puzzles etc. Just sit and enjoy :) !			",38,10,5,1,10,1,1

												Very enjoyable casual game. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good co-op experience. Neat puzzles, great artwork, though it is a bit short (lucky for you, there are sequels!)I usually use the wizard. I'd say about 30% of the stuff I place ends up in the right spot/useful, and the rest is usually on my partner's head, though I don't normally mean for that to happen. I figure that's pretty good. Other wizarding highlights include battles where your move is to spawn a box/plank and stand still while using it to whack things. Sometimes it kills them, sometimes not, sometimes things go flying off the map at speeds you never thought they could go.I'd give it 9/10. 10/10 once I figure out the fireball.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My oh my! I've reached my 30s, and never had the opportunity to try some co-op multiplayer; what a waste!I'm sure Trine must have been a great experience had I played it on my own, but first time playing it, was with a friend. And that was one heck of an experience!I haven't have had so much fun since many years! I was laughing all the way until the sun came up. We had a second session the next day to finish it - I can't imagine how great it would had been if there was 3 friends (instead of 2) playing the game together, but I'm very positive that I'll be playing this game again one day!+amazingly replayable ""puzzles""+very easy, not frustrating at all, very smooth progression+feels like a dream+co-op!

It's fun to play around with physics, solve puzzles and progress further in the somewhat trivial but nicely told story.The only thing missing were some cool boss fights maybe. Those kind of enemies where you have to figure out a strategy and which would not die after a few hits with a sword.Definitely worth playing for casual players and fans of this genre!

For a side-scrolling-platforming-puzzler it is quite the game, giving you a new sense of adventure with its epic graphics for a 2009 game, and great point-and-click gameplay. 100% Would recommend to anyone who is hesitant about it. But if it is between Trine or Trine 2, go for Trine 2. The story is pretty interesting, but you can sorta live without it.			",34,7,0,11,2,0,3

												I bought this game for 4€ due to a steam coupon and it was totally worth it. It's a nice platforming where you can controll 3 different ""heroes"" with different abilities. What I really liked about this game was that you can solve the different puzzles on different ways according to your playstyle (mage,rogue or warrior) especially when you progress in the game and achieve more abilities.Although I liked this game, I thought it was way to easy. I played it the first time on ""medium"" and did it all on the first try (except the last level where I needed like 3 trys) and you can't really die due to the checkpoint system. Even on the difficulty ""Very Hard"" it was still very easy in my opinion but this might be due to my full-leveled heroes. The game has various achievements like exploring (finding all experience bottles in the levels) and ""fun"" achievements like jumping on 5 different skeletons; a good mix in my opinion.Finally, you can beat this game in like 7-8 hours when you play it the first time and like to explore the levels to find the experience flasks which are very nicely hidden and it's fun to explore the levels.

												Good puzzle-platformer. Trine reminds me of the old The Lost Vikings for its gameplay, you get three different characters and alternate in between them to get through the challenged on each stage.Visually very pretty, Trine's narrative has a dose of humor and a very nice soundtrack that suits well each stage. It is fun to find every hidden item on the game, and at times some clever exploration is required.The game itself is quite easy though, even on the hardest mode. Very little enemy variation (You basically kill a horde of skeletons), and it gets repetitive when you approach the end.Anyway, it was a fun ride, and certainly more than I'd ask for the price of admission.7/10			",501,163,5,117,61,3,103

												The first thing that strikes you about ths platform game is the glorious backgrounds! They are nothing short of stunning! The gameplay is great too, presenting puzzles for each of your three characters with their own unique abilities. One thing to note though is that it's best played with a controller as using the keys is very cumbersome. Overall, a beautiful game that will keep you twiddling away for hours! Great stuff!

												Trine has an enchanted atmosphere, mainly bacause of the art style and the music. Bright and beautiful, it has its own way with colors and lightning, creating a calm, fairytale-like, experience. I was also impressed how magic, consisting in conjuring and telekinesis, wasn't overblown: where other games feature spellcasting machines of death, the wizard in this one is to be used with more touch and tactic. The thief is, ofcourse, athletic and fast. I have to confess that I found the warrior both uninteresting and mostly useless. The physical engine is one of the main feautures and it adds a sense of freedom and choice to the platfomring experience. The storyline, though, seemed a bit dull and cliché and I just couldn't care about it too much, even if the narrating voice had its appeal. It kind of felt like a game that takes an infantile setting and tryes to make it more mature, but doesn't succeed completely; it's also a bit too short and it won't satisfy those who are looking for more of a challenge, at least not on medium difficulty. Overally: reccomended. I will be trying the sequels as soon as possible.			",29,9,0,10,3,0,3

												This is an absolutely brilliant game for a casual multiplayer session with a couple of friends.First of all, I'm not sure I'd play it singleplayer, as the storyline is lacklustre (something about magic and an ancient artefact, I think) and the gameplay laborious. but add another player and that's where it really shines. It plays like a platformer/puzzler hybrid and two or three players combining the different abilities of the characters makes for endless fun.Secondly, play with an Xbox controller (or similar). The keyboard/mouse controls are not so great, but it's really fluid with a controller - and this is coming from a PC gamer who has almost never used a gamepad.Essentially this game has you (and/or your friends) as a wizard (with abilities to conjour boxes etc), a knight (with a sword and magical shield) and a thief (with a grappling hook and bow). All of these abilities are well bnalanced, and you will find yourself having to use all three characters as you work around the puzzles in your way. There might be any number of solutions to a given puzzle, so it's worth trying all the characters.Finally, this game has recieved a graphical overhaul and looks absolutely beautiful. The 'theme' is a very colourful fairytale look, with locations from enchanted forests with colourful flowers, giant leaves and massive snails to underground caverns with glowing crystals and bottomless pits. It's essentially a 2.5D game (3D animation in a 2D plane), but don't let that put you off - the backgrounds and lighting are very impressive.Definitely a 9/10 - loses the one point for the weak storyline and crazy boss level, but it's still a really fun game. Definitely worth picking up.			",41,2,2,2,2,0,6

												Wizard: uses blunt object to solve all his problems. Puzzles, walls, skeletons, you name it.Knight:  conjures the power of lightning and fire and gravity to crush his opponents to dust.Yeeaah I didn't have it the other way around.This game is friggin beautiful. THE BOXES ARE PRETTY I CARRY ALL OF THEM AS FAR IN THE LEVEL AS I CAN.no really, the visuals are 10/10. there's this one point where there's a dark place with only a singles source of light, and putting a clockwork box close to it would cast a beautifully moving shadow in the background and I just lost it. visuals 10/10the wizard: is hilarious xD he can only make boxes and that's it. but hey, if you look at the top of this review you'll know what's so fun about it. sometimes tho, you will end up gently caressing the skeleton with a box. which is really awkward. there's also the skeleton doing parkour on your boxes and he starts looking really cool. Did I mention, skeletons look hella bad♥♥♥♥♥smashing clockwork boxes you make.verdict: wizard is the best character in the game. he's pretty much the strongest if you use him right. if you don't he makes your enemies look really cool tho.knight (see top, he's awesome when he gets there)thief:grappling hook at nearly half the game constructs. that should be enough fun for you.enemies aren't too varied tho. or maybe that's just what it seems to me since theyz all skeletons.the obstacles are pretty easy xD with more than one possible solution, and each obstacle holds  a single common solution which is a stack of boxes. boxes aside, the obstacles are very diverse, and you wouldn't be bored of solving them with boxes. think onepunch man(i mean saitama is pretty bored but dude the people watching that thing sure as hell aren't).that last part was a bit anti-climatic tho :c which is sad. It sorta leaves you wanting for more, and wanting more to smash. WHICH IS NOT BAD FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE TRINE 2 on fam share! (buying this game on sale is strongly reccomended)TLDR: the game is really amazing, yet leaves much to be desired. more enemies for example.			",58,18,0,7,6,1,5

												Stunningly beautiful and amazingly tranquil (for a game with lots of skeletons and deadly traps), Trine is a 1-3 player puzzle-ish platformer featuring three switchable characters traversing a land full of aforementioned skeletons and deadly traps, having at their disposal a sword and a shield, a bow and a grappling hook (sic!), and the ability to conjure objects out of thin air, as well as do some telekinesis. All of that makes for a great platforming experience, complete with collectables and secrets, as per genre's standards. Overall Trine is a must-have, must-play and must-buy-the-sequel.

Only that Trine looks and plays like a fairytale arcade, not to difficult, rather relaxing and with many mini-puzzles elements that I also love. I'm not big fan of arcade games, so it was good to me that Trine more like to test your brain with puzzles, than your reflexes. Sadly I cannot tell this about the second part.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played through the game single player and was left with this, ""oh ok...and then?"" hollow feeling.  Towards the end between items and levels it pretty much negates the difficulty and puzzles.  The narrative is pretty standard fantasy, aloof wizard, sneaky thief and meat head warrior go to the place and get the thing.PROS:+ Graphics+ Music+ Atmosphere+ It's fun+ starts off as a good puzzle platformer+ Story starts off interestingCONS:- Quit Game nag to buy Trine 3...EVERY TIME- Music can sometimes drown out diologue- Characters become too powerful for the games own good negating the puzzle aspect of the game- Faux wood...apparently in trine land there's things that look like they're made of wood but are made od marshmellows?- hit box wonkiness- anti-climaticYET I still recommend it.  Why? It's a fun game you have to look at as a small indie game from 2009 which lacked the resourcs of huge AAA studios. Yes I know it's no excuse but it helps understand it's short comings.  See for this it wasn't like a lot of games that shall remain nameless, where the short comings where not because of studio size or budget or man power but ""we need something for a season pass"".  BTW this is about Trine 1 not 3...just saying.Towards the end it feels like going through the motions.  In the beginning it was ""shoot the rope and slam the wall like some rube goldberg machine"" towards the end it's ""Planks, platforms and boxes...everywhere! I have no time for you platforming puzzels"".  Or ""I could move the heavy box then grab it with my shield and break the wall OOOOOOr I can just thunder hammer and break everything breakable on the screen""It's like the difficulty curve doesn't match how powerful the characters get.  The last level feels like the devs knew this so they just throw things at you to throw things at you.  You die, rarely, not because of a mis jump or an attempt to solve a puzzle goes bad but because that wooden beam isn't wood, it just looks like wood OR a mob spawns where you're jumping mid jump and it's hit box is more important than yours so you Super Mario bounce into lava.It's that last level, that kinda gave me the ""oh ok"" feeling.   You get to the base of the tower, some lich is there for...reasons. the thief says ""hurry jump on the platform"".  I was expecting something like the infamous level in Ori and the Blind Forrest then a boss fight.  What I got was a ""hurry as in take you time there's no rush laval moves slow after all"" and nothing.This is where the short comings of the gameplay meets the short coming of the story.  The story starts off like the typical fantasy ""reluctant hero(s) in the wrong place at the wrong time thrust in to this world saving adventure"" even going as far as to touch on the character's motivations, yet it just ends. I was expecting a ""we got the mcguffin but lets continue to work together to save the land from this lich"" what I got was ""This lich that coated the world in darkness and raised the dead, hit him in the face once it's his only weakness yay you win! NO QUESTIONS""I know the story isn't important, the game is mostly fun but if they're going to add a narravite then it something that will either add or take away from the game.Overall again, I do recommend it.  It's a fun game and made me want to play Trine 2. It has it's short comming and would suggest either buying 1 and 2 or getting it on sale.  It's an amazing game lumps and all for $2.25 during the 2015/6 winter sale.			",119,31,0,17,7,2,3

												+ Great, atmospheric art style+ Wizard's conjuring and Thief's grappling hook are fun to play with+/- Easy difficulty except in a few spots- Short length- Enimies are pointless annoyances6.5/10A fun, easy little timewaster that's pretty to look at. Don't expect much of a challenge. ",122,58,1,25,15,5,23

												You need this and Trine 2 - what an ingenious game.  The levels are absolutely beautiful (check my screenshots for examples), the gameplay is straightforward but demanding, and the puzzles will leave you wanting more once you've figured them out. Fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic game, period.			",77,2,0,2,1,1,2

												So far i'm hooked,i'm a old-school gamer and its nice to see updated 2D side-scroller games being made with new features,Not that i don't enjoy modern 3D games i play alot but i feel gameplay should alway overshadow graphics if you like platform of puzzle games give it a try,I got Trine 1&2 on sale so i will be busy awhile lol			",390,115,9,86,20,3,59
