 IMPORTANT: If Riven is crashing for you, make sure to do the following: 1. Start the game2. Alt+tab out and open up the Task Manager3. Under the 'Processes' tab, find Riven and right click it4. Select 'Go to details' on the right click menu5. Right click Riven again6. Select 'Set affinity'7. Set it to run on only one core by unchecking all of the boxes except for oneThis should solve the problem of it crashing after a few minutes of play, but you will have to do this every time you start up the game.Besides that, there's not much else to say. Riven is a great game, there's a reason it's considered a classic.			",24,21,0,0,2,0,0

												Riven is a sequel to Myst, an old school click adventure game that revolves solving intricate puzzles and exploring surreal worlds created from linking books. First off let me tell you that Riven is not revised for modern hardware, as such, some feature set is very archaic. The save menu operates like a word document save menu. The resolution is stuck at a piddly 640x480 resolution, this makes playing the game on modern monitors an absolutely awful visual experience. To makes matter worst, the game cannot be set to windowed mode without some major .exe hex coding voodoo. That set aside, the game is still worth playing. After all with the limitation of Riven’s game engine, which is essentially one huge powerpoint slide, it’s not too strange that the game is limited in resolution. The game is a little over 3 gigabytes and it’s 33% of 1080p. Keep in mind that this game was created in 1997, which equates to a 5 CD game. Had this game release at 1080p, it would’ve been around 15 CD’s. Have fun switching and keeping track of that many disk while playing!Low resolution doesn’t necessarily mean the graphics in Riven are at all bad. In fact, Riven’s pre-rendered graphic looks awesome! It doesn’t look plastic like you would expect from a game from this era, but fairly photorealistic. The graphic looks crisp, and the surreal architecture of the buildings and environment in game brings a sense of wonder and mystery. Very few games in 1997 can blow you away graphically, Riven is one of those games that will leave you in awe at the beauty of 1997 technology.The music and ambient track in Riven is absolutely amazing on a beefy surround sound system. Visually I was put off by the gigantic black bounding box on screen but the sound immersed me enough for me to overlook the huge dark void surrounding the game. The sounds from a water creek would fade in and out as I get closer or farther away from the source. The sound of machinery is so crisp I could believe I have such machinery in my house. Riven isn’t for casuals or the easily frustrated. The puzzles in this game are one of the most mind bending and complicated in any game I have ever played. This is probably the first game ever that I got lost even with the assistance of a walkthrough. It’s not that the puzzles are too obscure to figure out, it’s because the logic behind them and the reference to them is sometimes hard to pick up. The map and locale of Riven is also massive so backtracking for clues can become a headache. With the limited screenshot capabilities of the game, it’s even harder to remember specific details about clues without jotting down rough notes to what you see. For casuals and unclean masses who have never played an adventure game before, this game is a deathwish. Veterans of the point and click genre will definitely be challenged. Riven regardless of it’s age is still well worth playing for veterans of point and clicks. It aged relatively well even with it’s hideous resolution. If you’re itching for a masochistic slideshow adventure game, you won’t find a better one anywhere on steam.

												Anyone else remember this game? Riven was the sequel to the massively popular game Myst which launched in 1993. It was famously one of the first games to be released on a CD and helped to popularize the CD-ROM drive. I can't even believe Myst is more than 20 years old now. I can still remember playing Myst on Windows 3.1 and how frustratingly often it used to crash. Then Riven was released in 1997 and came on 5 CDs. You had to annoyingly keep swapping the CDs out as you explored different parts of the island. There's a lot of stuff like this about Riven that requires the player to have a lot of patience. Patience that I had as a kid, but has long since left me as an adult. It's kind of a shame because I'm pretty sure that if I played a game like Riven today, I'd push it aside after 15 minutes or so and move on to something else. While there are some technical limitations and some game mechanics in Riven that have not aged well over the years, there's also a lot this game does really smartly. It's a ""slow burn"" type of game. If you give Riven your time and patience, it will reward you with some amazingly clever puzzles and an unusual and immersive fantasy story. For those not familiar with the Myst games, they are point & click style adventure games. But not quite in the same way as the old King's Quest or Monkey Island games. They're no puzzles that involve combining items together through some absurd logic that allows you to progress further or whatever. In Riven, you're gated only by how much you've explored and how deep your understanding is about the island and its inhabitants. It's a game that does a beautiful job of communicating a complex story with few words and minimal cutscenes. The only cutscene you're given for quite a while is the game's initial opening cutscene, which really gives you more questions than answers. During this cryptic scene, a man teleports you to an island called Riven after giving you nothing but two books. You arrive in a jail cell on Riven where one of the books you were given is promptly stolen by a man who does not speak your language. The thief is then quickly killed by another mysterious person who sets you free, but not before taking the stolen book for himself. You're then free to explore the island and unravel the mystery of Riven. An intriguing open, no? What's in that book that's worth killing for? And who are these people who are so desperate to get it?Riven's story is told through exploring the island, discovering its secrets and understanding the meaning and purpose behind them. Riven doesn't tell its story through dialogue or cutscenes as in most games. When you do watch a cutscene in the game, it usually only serves to confirm what you've figured out about the island already. It's never directly or clearly communicated to you what any of the character's motivations are or even why you were sent to the island in the first place. It's really up to the player to discover and understand the deep story in Riven for themselves, and this may have been the most satisfying part of the game for me. I think the best way to go about doing this is to always ask the question ""Why?"" when something doesn't make sense. A lot of the fun in this game is trying to form the answers to all of the questions the game gives based on what you know about the island so far. The developers did a fantastic job of being very deliberate with their world design. Nothing is there by accident or coincidence, nearly every object or structure in the game is meant to communicate something important to you. As you explore Riven, you'll encounter many mysterious machines and contraptions. Ask ""What do they do?"". ""Who would have put them here?"". If you think on these questions, eventually the details of the story will come in to focus.The puzzles in Riven are given to you in a similar fashion as the story. The objective or elements of the puzzle aren't given to you explicitly, but rather communicated to you subtly through the environment and world design. It's definitely a game where you have to keep a sheet or two of handwritten notes while you're playing, which is something not many games do anymore. Some of the puzzles in Riven are downright brilliant. There's one amazing puzzle in particular where I can remember feeling so impressed with myself after I had figured it out. The solutions to these puzzles are really so satisfying when you finally figure them out. I'd challenge you to play through this game without looking any of them up.Riven is not without its faults though and some of them are unfortunately due to this game's age. The game is first person, but it's not full 3D. It's essentially a bunch of still images that have been linked together. This, to me, really makes the game feel aged. A full 3D engine would do this game a lot of good. The game's pace is also incredibly slow and it can be very frustrating to be stuck in one place for a while and feel like you're not progressing. This will likely happen a lot in Riven which can be discouraging to players if they don't have a deep well of patience. There are certain puzzles in the game where Riven may have been to clever for its own good. The puzzle solutions are fair, but they're hidden so deeply in the game's world that they're not easily discovered without a very keen eye and extremely sharp mind.If you've got the time and patience and love puzzle games, mysteries or unusual stories, Riven would probably be a good fit for you. Just keep in mind that this game will probably show its age and you may also get stuck frequently while playing it. If you've never played a game in the Myst series and are curious, Riven is a great place to start. It's a refinement and improvement on everything that the first game was. While subsequent games in the series improved their audiovisual fidelity, they never quite recaptured the sublime story or brilliant puzzles that made Riven a great game. Also steer clear of Myst 5. That game is terrible. Rand Miller, one of the lead creative minds behind Myst and Riven recently launched a successful kickstarter for his new game, Obduction. It sounds like Obduction will play similarly to Riven and I'd love to try another game like this to see if I still have the patience for it. I'll be interested to monitor the development of Obduction and hopefully play it soon.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ ",187,67,2,27,7,1,19

												This is one of the best games you will ever play, and it will take a bit to explain why.First of all, there is little in the way of 'gameplay': it is a point-and-click adventure game, with no reward given to reflexes or hand-eye coordination. That's not the kind of game this is. The controls are there; they do what they need to do and nothing else. It won't detract from your enjoyment, simply because you'll never feel the need to shoot at something or jump over a pit of lava.Second of all, you need to play Myst first, and Myst isn't the best game ever made. Myst will do two things for you: it will start you off with the story and the concept of linking books, and it will warm up the parts of your brain that you'll need to solve Riven. Unlike Myst, there is so much lore and eyecandy in Riven that you won't know what notes to take and what you need to remember, and you won't know a puzzle even when it's staring you in the face. Yes, sometimes you'll find a combination lock or something traditional like that, but you'll also encounter obstacles that you won't even know are solvable. It is one of the hardest puzzle games ever made, but it does it the right way: No pixel hunting and no subversive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Third of all, the Steam version and the GoG version are both broken. Get yourself a copy of the DVD version.With that all in mind, go fiddle your way through your favorite Myst remake, and then sit down with a pencil and paper and have your mind blown. Right here is where the universe blossoms, right here is where the blunt story of a peculiar family suddenly shows it's true depth, right here is where you disover that there is thousands of years of history behind you, right here is where you discover that the Miller brothers are two brilliant and crazy motherfrakkers.And if you look up the solution to a puzzle online, you'll ruin the whole thing. Reach out and poke someone on Steam for a hint. Don't spoil the greatest ocean of atmosphere and intrigue ever made.			",90,14,1,3,11,0,11

												The game worked for me on Windows XP, I just had to set the compatibility mode for the Riven.exe and then start the game as usual via Steam. On Windows 7 onwards it seems to start without that trick.However this version is quite messed up. The files are taken from the 10th Anniversary DVD Edition, but the Riven.exe is from the CD Version. Additionally the file t_Data.MHK (all the files for Temple Island) from the CD Version is included. This leads to the following problems:The CD Version basically only works fine on Windows 9x/Me. On newer systems, the  videos are placed one pixel too low  which totally breaks the immersion. I have never seen the CD Version work correctly on Windows XP, Windows 7 and so on.Because of the engine of the CD version, the  additional graphics (stills) and videos from the DVD version cannot be accessed  within the game.This is also why the  button ""Start saved game"" on the main screen doesn't work.  This screen is from the DVD version and the mentioned button doesn't exist in the CD version, so the Riven.exe won't do anything when clicking on the button.The game uses the t_Data.MHK from the CD version, which means that  all the graphics, sounds and videos on Temple Island as well as all the intro videos are from the CD version.  If you take the Maglev from Temple Island to Jungle Island, the lower quality video is used. If you take the same route backwards, the higher quality video from the DVD version is used as it belongs to the Jungle Island data files. This is ridiculous. Also you can see that the Red Orb Intro is shown, not the UbiSoft Intro that is still contained in the t_Data1.MHK. It seems that the t_Data1.MHK and the t_Data2.MHK (almost 700 MB in total) from the DVD version are ignored.To top it all,  some (tiny) videos are not being played  in this version, for example all the buttons that call the Maglevs and the button that rotates the dome (at the beginning of the game). I have no idea why they cut that.Maybe they had problems with the DVD version (Riven.exe) of the game, concerning QuickTime or whatever, so they had  to use the engine of the CD version. This is already a dealbreaker because of the videos showing one pixel too low unless you're using Windows 9x/Me, but Steam only supports Windows XP and newer versions.Maybe they couldn't get the t_Data1.MHK and the t_Data2.MHK to work with the CD version so they added the t_Data.MHK from CD 2. This leads to this strange mixture of CD and DVD videos and sounds in-game. And why did they keep the t_Data1.MHK and the t_Data2.MHK then? I think they are never used in the game. Not only is this a waste of space and bandwidth, of course we don't expect one island to look worse than the others.			",42,17,8,0,3,1,3

												I was really excited to play this game, and for such a cheap price I was sold. The product however, does NOT run properly on windows 7 despite the steam store, and I did not realise until afterward. The game will inconsistantly freeze up when changing screens or saving, averaging 5-20 minutes of play between crashes. It is really disappointing to be unable to play such a great game, but I cannot reccomend it in the state it is sold.			",35,7,0,6,4,0,3

												A classic game, I’m very glad I invested the small amount to purchase it on Steam.  Riven is and forever will be my favorite of the Myst games, and while I would dearly like to see it lovingly restored as Myst has been, it is still a pleasure to play in its original form.Having completed the game, I will say once again that it is not without its bugs, but the workarounds are acceptable if done properly and in advance (I did them once before I started gameplay and did not have to do them again).  I completed this game using Windows 7 64bit and was able to avoid freeze-ups, major glitches (there was some minor screen clipping during videos and sound clipping during minor interactions which did not affect gameplay), or deleted saves.  I used the following fixes…Make sure the game is up to date.Set the game to play in compatibility mode (in this instance I chose Windows 98/ME with all the boxes checked including ‘run as administrator’)Set you launch option to ‘/affinity 1’Make certain you use multiple saveThis should give you smooth gameplay with a minimum of bugs save for one:After entering the cell in the Rivenese village, you will walk down a dark tunnel.  If you go to the very end of the tunnel and turn around, the game will glitch and land you back at the swinging chair.  To avoid this, light the first lamp, glitch, run the tunnel again, but this time stop the first time you see light, turn around and light the lamp, work your way back from there. This was the only frustrating glitch I encountered.Enjoy! ",19,6,0,3,2,0,1

												Riven is the second entry into the Myst series and the sequel to the original Myst game, both of which were extremely well received and achieved massive commercial success, selling millions of copies and being available across a spectrum of platforms including;  Mac, Saturn, Windows, Jaguar CD, 3DO, CD-i, PlayStation, AmigaOS, PSP, Nintendo DS. Riven takes place immediately after the events following Myst in which you play the role of yourself, sent to Riven to free Atrus's wife and capture Ghen, a power hungry lunatic who was banished to Riven.Riven, like the original and the others in the series is a puzzle based adventure game in which you will need to traverse across islands, explore them carefully and elaborately and solve puzzles. Riven like Myst is extremely hard, these are probably the hardest puzzle games on the market yet at the same time are logical and fair. I first experienced these as a child but had no idea what I was doing and gave up pretty shortly then went back to playing Duke Nukem 3D, now that I am older and wiser was finally able to appreciate these games, to call Myst and Riven masterpieces would be an understatement, these are works of art in every regard. I have yet to try Myst III and upwards and can’t wait.Riven features tough puzzles, has an amazing soundtrack, brilliant plot and some of the best art work in gaming that will leave you in awe, while this may be picture-based there are some scenes which feature real actors and are done very well. Riven has an atmosphere so thick you’d need a steak knife to slice through it, an insane amount of attention to detail was put into consideration when designing every square millimetre of this game, everything is done so well.I hope they remake this along the line with a new engine so more people and future generations will be obliged to give it a shot as this is a piece of artwork that everyone should experience.

												Honestly, Riven was probably my least favorite entry in the Myst series. What I enjoy most about the Myst series, is the prospect of walking around through beautiful, exotic, semi-abandoned worlds. Riven is the Myst game that least fits that description. And since it has been many years since I read the Myst novels, I found the exact plot of Riven rather confusing. And some of the puzzles are just annoying. Like, throughout the game there are doors that you can open with a click, and you can also close them with a click. Normally, this is a completely useless feature, and you assume it's just there for completeness. But exactly twice in the game, there are hidden passages that you don't see unless you close a door after passing through it.With all that said, being my least favorite entry in the Myst series still means it's a pretty great game. Gehn's character is great, and the sun-drenched isles of Riven are beautiful to walk around, and to figure out the economy of how they all fit together.And of course, if you're going to play the Myst series, you've got to play Riven anyway.

												Whenever I get into a gaming comversation with anyone, I generally ask if they have played the Myst series, and of course they answer no. The Myst series, especially Riven, is not for those who cannot live without amazing graphics, and the point of the game is not in the graphics for me. It's the puzzle that makes this game amazing.You find yourself getting a special notebook for the game, drawing out the various shapes you find in the world because it might be a clue later on. Riven is my favorite in the series because it has some of the most difficult, yet most rewarding puzzles I could imagine. Solving the big puzzles requires a careful understanding of the world you have explored, and the ability to recognize an association between two items, perhaps a sound and an image. This does require patience! You might get stuck for several days on a problem, but when you finally figure it out it all makes sense!Despite having played several modern games like Team Fortress 2 and Warframe, I still view this game as the best game I have ever played.

												They sure don't make them like this anymore. A product from a time when boasting about a 'cinematic experience' actually meant creating a genuinely engaging, immersive universe instead of linear cutscene-saturated hand-holding. Yes, you're actually going to have to, christ forbid, read to make proper sense of the story. Yes you're actually going to need to use your brain and take notes to solve puzzles. However it's all in service of a visual and storytelling richness that takes me right back to the days when I was playing this on quintuple CD-ROM.Word of warning that the game is pretty much stuck in its original 640x480 resolution, I'd recommend playing it windowed, or adjust program resolution in compatibility options. Supposedly there are compatibility issues with W7 but I haven't experienced any problems in that department.			",83,21,0,6,10,0,22

												This is a review of Riven (the sequel to MYST) Steam version. I say this first because i've already played the game originally in 1997 and certain things had changed for this review (alltough the game essentially is the same from 1997 just compiled to dowload online).I loved the game when i first played it (almost 20 years ago by now). It was a very interesting sequel to Myst and added many things to the story (in fact, it had a story!) You meet ghen, catherine and again Atrus.  There is something going on at least! that is the main thing i guess.The game came out in 5 cd rom discs wich was pretty notable for that time, lots of data and videos. More than 3gb of data for 1997 was a heavy thing.The puzzles are very hard, it is still hard now,but, even if you use a walkthrough it still is rewarding to find out how the world works, how the story of atrus and his family and the linking books unfolds.The music is the best. Pretty much half of the experience in this game (the first one and this one in fact) is the music. Totally amazing, complements the graphics so well and what happens on screen at times. The graphics by the way, were so amazing in 97 that, still, to this day in some places,  they still seem to be made last week. Of course, in general they've became old, but still, this is a 20 years old game!!! Is like watching a movie from 1996 and thinking that the special effects are not so bad...Now, that was my review from the original game. Now to some things from actual steam/gog version i am reviewing and why i post a negative review.While i was happy to be able to have a newer build of this classic game, wich i can download from steam and install in modern OS everytime i want. i did encountered certain problems, wich are not acceptable even if it is an old game.First, the game crashes in certain contexts, certain situations. Like for example clicking too fast when moving around (wich of course didn't happen in the original version) While i know that if i don't click too fast i will probably avoid these crashes, still is something that should be taken care of. Specially knowing that the creators and the company of this game (cyan) still exists and should be made aware of this and take care of the problem. Second, in certain situation when saving, your game can crash, during the saving screen... (if you don't use the save buttons).Also, third, and most catastrophic, there is a scene in game, where you have to turn on a light in a passage. When you do that, and you turn around, either the game crashes or takes you to a previous screen.... this is unavoidable. There is anyway, a way to continue through the passage after turning on the light (without crashing) so i finished the game luckily, but i already knew what to do there, i don't know what i could have done if it were my first time playing it, and didn't knew what to do there. This is something that happens at least in a win 7 64 environment and should be fixed, if not they are essentialy selling you a broken game. This is why i will not recommend this game, at least this version on steam and gog (the same). It is a shame, there was an interesting game...somewhere, there, but now it is too old, and its broken in someplaces so... (you could say that, ironically,  the game, the same as the fifth age in riven, have become full of fissures everywhere....how sad...)			",12,16,0,0,0,0,0

												This game might not work in some operative systems. I had issues in Win8 and Win7 but it’s working fine in Win10.No, you don’t have to play Myst before this one. The vast majority of what you see in Riven is new or was just mentioned in the previous game of the series.---With that out of the way, you’re probably still wondering what this game exactly offers. Gameplay wise, it’s Myst. You point and click, solve puzzles, see small cutscenes, have people talk at you, and interact with them, leading you to the good ending, or one of the 9 or so branch offs.Scenario wise, I loved it a LOT. More than Myst. Riven reminds me of my childhood (I grew up in a very green island in the middle of the Atlantic so there’s that). The cutscenes for the trams are amazing, if you can handle the low resolution. With headphones and in my dark room, I felt like I was really there, a pseudo rollercoaster over (and sometimes under) the sea. Spying the villagers from afar was a nice touch, a distancing from the emptiness of the Ages in the previous Myst.The lore and background story is given mostly by notebooks and the like that you occasionally find. Even the small things in the scenarios tell you small stories of their own.I didn’t like the way puzzles were structured. Riven is more of an open world, while Myst was quite linear. Some clues seemed so scattered around and senseless I had a hard time connecting the dots. Also, beware unskippable cutscenes. Many of them. They are small and you repeat them often. Any cutscene where the animation is off-screen, welp you can’t skip it. Also, that long speech from Gehn. Ya, you can’t skip the longest part of it. Oh and the game pauses when you alt+tab, so you really have to watch it.---Overall I liked it. The premise is simple but enjoyable. Having real people talk to you in this surreal but photorealistic place really helps with the immersion, as well as the simple soft soundtrack and the ambient sounds.I wish I could visit Riven in it’s former glory.PS: Fans were making a realRiven of sorts, it’s called The Starry Expanse Project. It still has a long way to go but it does look great.			",304,104,10,67,29,7,45

												Riven upped the ante after Myst.  This time, you are not so alone in the world you play in.  There are a few creatures and characters, but the interaction is still non-existent the majority of the time.  However, Riven, similar to Myst is all about the puzzles and not so much about the interactions with NPCs or other characters.  The story is still simply there to give you reason for the puzzles rather than anything else.  The graphics look better than Myst and the world is much larger.  Classic game, and a must have for any adventure genre fan.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												I would give this 0/5... The original game is amazing. I love both Myst and Riven, but this game (as offered by steam) is so jam packed with bugs I can’t even enjoy myself. I downloaded this game and played for about 3 hours and got really far. I reached a point where I got caught in a bug where if I turned around I would get relocated to a different part of the level. This bug blocked me from making further progress in the game because I needed to press a button that I could not get to. I am stuck and it is impossible to make further progress and I have only played through about 1/3rd of the game. I even tried starting over but I keep running into the same bug. Also, the game crashes once about every 45 minutes. So if you feel so inclined to buy this game instead of the actual DVD version for some strange reason, I would recommend that you SAVE EVERY TIME YOU DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE. You won’t regret it.

												Because its current form is quite aged, Riven requires an open mind to enjoy.Get this game because: puzzles (which  are near perfectly built into environment and story); story; the most beautiful animated slideshow adventure there is.Cons: 1997 display resolution; having to wait ~20sec for some journal pages to load (old, sequential scripting and filing); having to blip from the game to learn basic D'ni counting (which is base-25)Btw, the Starry Expanse Project aims to remake this game in Unreal Engine 4.Easy fix to bug: Before you get to the Moeity age called Tay, after activating the light at the end of the secret prison tunnel, repeat the path from the gallows UNTIL YOU FIRST SEE THE WATER, THEN TURN AROUND and continue lighting the tunnel, and finishing the game.This brief review is biased because I played this game as an infant.  I can play the entire thing now within three hours because I am familiar with the Myst / D'ni fictional world.			",75,25,3,7,20,0,2

												Riven picks up right where it's famous prequel Myst leaves off. Atrus has just returned from Myst island and he asks the stranger (you) to travel to Riven; a world gradually falling apart, where his wife Catherine is imprisoned. While Atrus makes hasty edits to Riven's master book to hold the world together you must find out what happened to Catherine and imprison Atrus' corrupt father Gehn.Riven was the pinnacle point and click adventure game, one of the best games of the genre. It's puzzle design, world building, and storytelling complement each other seamlessly. As you explore you will encounter Gehn's various ploys to govern and awe the Rivenese, you will penetrate the systems he devised to keep himself safe from intruders, evade his henchman who want to capture you, and discover the underground resistance that will aid you.Riven has aged extremely well in both it's visuals and mechanics. its an unforgettable world that tells a minimal, tight story through it's images and puzzles. The year after Riven was released Half Life burst on the scene and made action game the hot new thing. If Half Life represented the birth of a new type of game Riven was the last act of the old guard, a final masterpiece polished to a mirror shine. This game took advantage of new technology to perfect its genre and as the last great adventure game before their decline it's too good to miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Catherine has been kidnapped and 'The Stranger' (you) have been sent to Riven to find and return her to Atrus. Just like in Myst you will be solving puzzles at every turn and the answers aren't always that easy to find! This game is 4x bigger than Myst and it shows as the depth of the puzzles will leave you stumped for hours! So go my friend and start the epic journey that is: RIVEN...			",100,27,3,15,29,1,9

Still, that didn't stop me from being able to complete the game and puzzles (with some help) and it still looks good.  What little music the game has is great too, but most is ambient.What makes the game so difficult is a combination of trial and error, clues being very cryptic or difficult to decipher, and many objects you interact with that feel like they may be related to solving a puzzle aren't.

The people of Riven had it's own language & numerology, which you had to learn to figure out some puzzles around the islands.  Not to mention that the storyline continues from the first game's ending.If you have the original Myst, you need to have Riven.			",174,74,1,49,30,0,21

Still, that didn't stop me from being able to complete the game and puzzles (with some help) and it still looks good.  What little music the game has is great too, but most is ambient.What makes the game so difficult is a combination of trial and error, clues being very cryptic or difficult to decipher, and many objects you interact with that feel like they may be related to solving a puzzle aren't.  Crashed on me several times in Windows 7.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												Even after all these years, the gameplay, the world, the colours, the story, the music, the puzzles, it's still amazing. I played this when I was a teenager and I got chills then and I still got chills now. Goosebumps all the way. Haven't been able to play it in years because of compatability, so I'm very happy this version works.I discovered some bugs though, in some places there is a weird glimmer on the screen and you get 'teleported' to another location. It is possible to work around this, but it is a bit frustrating in a particular place. But besides that, I'm very greatful it is possible to play this beautiful game almost 20 years (what... am I that old... wait) later.I loved this game, I still love it and I will always love it.

												The second of a series of five, Riven: The Sequel to Myst was 5 times bigger then Myst when it was first released back in 1997.  Originally with 5 disks, each for it's own island, Riven was a world all it's own.  The people of Riven had it's own language & numerology, which you had to learn to figure out some puzzles around the islands.  Not to mention that the storyline continues from the first game's ending.If you have the original Myst, you need to have Riven.			",174,74,1,49,30,0,21

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. Surprisingly, it still holds up well and is a fun little adventure title. Well worth a look if you've never played it and like the point and click genre, and also well worth a replay if you played it when it was new. I hope that Ubisoft and Cyan can settle what ever differences they have so we can get the rest of these games out on steam.			",16,21,0,3,2,0,1

												This has always been a classic. It's also available on iPad now which is even more fun for those times waiting at the airport or family get togethers. It's unique in that it is a puzzle game and without looking up the walkthroughs online, really makes it fun. I will give one hint to making sure you understand the game ahead of time, make sure to read any books you find, all of them. And take notes. It's really fun. Again, without cheating. Otherwise, where's the satisfaction in completing it sucessfully on your own? ;-)			",52,23,0,6,12,0,6

												Like any Myst game, it can hurt your brain to solve many of the puzzles, and it's worth it. At times you'll need pen and paper, especially for one puzzle where solving a major puzzle is in three different locations. It's not just take object from point A to point B, you really have to experiment and read journals to find clues and any possible puzzles. Some are obvious, some are not.If you played MYST, this gives more character development on Atrus and Catherine.It doesn't explain though, prior to the third game EXILE, how you come back through the fissure to meet Atrus and Catherine again. Probably the same way of discovering the Myst Linking book in the fissure? I guess that's up to the imagination of the player.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Not a bad game by any means, I feel that Riven will only appeal to a specific type of gamer. Someone who enjoys challenging brain work & getting immersed in exploring a strange world. You have to have patience of you want to get anywhere, & some of the puzzles can be obnoxiously vague. Also, running on a Windows 7, I had a lot of crashes. Not bad, but not for everyone.

												Riven the sequel to myst begins with you helping atrus by linking to a place called Riven in search of his wife Catherine,one of the problems you face when you link to riven is that you will have no way of getting back to dunny (where is dunny ?) well that is only reveled later on but for now you must seek out the truth behind where you came from,why you ended up on myst island and now you know why you are on riven ! If you help atrus he tells you he may help in getting you back to where you came from (it's funny when you read the myst books) so you journey on to riven with no linking books,many puzzles ahead and a very detailed and interesting world awaits.I would recommend playing REALMYST before playing riven,i would also recommend you avoid the newer rerelease of myst as it's a mess and if i were to choose a version of myst to play,it would always be realmyst over the original,when it comes to riven,like myst and realmyst there are problems on newer computers and windows 7,most of these problems are fixed by changing the .exe of both games compatibility to windows xp and also choosing administrator when launching both games,however on riven you will face two problems,first your game sometimes will lock up so you MUST save often,secondproblem is that your gamesave can sometimes corrupt,so save often and save to two slots each time you save the gameand you WILL get through the game from start to finish.Like the game before,riven is a fantastic game filled with atmosphere,it's a very taxing but relaxing game and also highly rewarding,this game is no walk in the park and you should expect to get stuck many times,there is no shame in googling a helping hand at riven from time to time,just don't spoil it ! even with it's age it has lost none of it's charm and will always be a game dear to me.On a final note,i recommend you play myst then look out for the myst books in an online book store,the three myst books are available in paper and digital form,after reading those books you will be itching to jump into riven and i am sure your eyes will be open to the amazing worlds of myst,the ages and the lore.The ending has not yet been writen  ",336,111,30,45,20,2,47

												One of the greatest first person adventure games to ever exist. Period.  Riven and the Myst series has so much lore and and huge world to explore.  Riven hasn't aged well to today's standards but don't let that dissuade  you from purchasing this classic gem.  Riven has extremely hard puzzles to master unless you use a walkthrough of course. If you haven't played Myst yet then I reccomend playing that first as you won't know what's going on in Riven.Summary:Starting some time after the conclusion of Myst, you, the traveller return to Myst Island to meet Atrus at his request.  Once there, Atrus informs you about his father Gehn and how Gehn kidnapped his wife Catherine in a world called Riven.  He asks you to go to Riven and rescue her.  A truly epic adventure to undertake.  Once on Riven you discover its inhabitant's are only slaves to Gehn who has escaped to another world due to the destabilization of Riven.  The inhabitants of Riven despise Gehn and will try to help the traveller to capture him.  Conclusion:Riven was the greatest adventure game of its time when it released a few years after Myst.  It was twice the size of Myst and came on multiple CD's which the player how to swap out every time they traveled to another island on Riven.  The puzzles are hard and require you to make diagrams to solve most of them.  This game is definatly NOT for the impatient player that can't stand drawing things and writing down names.  One of the puzzles requires you to know the D'ni alphabet and number system.  For this, you have to write it down.  This never detered me however, because the lore is so much better in Riven then in Myst.  You truly feel like you are the lone survivor on in a world with so much lore and history.

												When compared to Myst, this sequel certainly ranks up both the difficulty and the quality of the story it is trying to tell. If you can get through the game without needing to refer to a guide I have to admit you are far better at solving puzzles and mysteries than me. Riven is brutal about NOT telling you where to go at times and a number of critical clues can easily be overlooked. I would recommend having a pen and paper handy on your desk to take notes of things you see, read and hear. Furthermore I'll give you one really big suggestion for one section of the game; a pair of doors you open cover over passages you need to find. Close them again once you have passed through to see the passages. It is games like this which make you realize how easy modern game developers go on players these days when it comes to puzzles. If you like a good story, enjoy logic puzzles and have patience I'd highly recommend this game despite its antique graphics.			",94,30,2,14,6,0,7

												This is a very old game that likes to lock up, so save a lot. You do that by pressing CTRL-S, and load your save by pressing CTRL-O. Laughably arcane now, but there you are. It's funny to accidentally press ALT and bring up a menu bar in an IMMERSIVE!!!!! game like this.The graphics still look pretty good, though primitively implemented. It's cool to look at and listen to. It's too bad the game is so stupid-hard. Glancing at a strategy guide periodically is necessary not to know what to do but just to make sure you're going in generally the right direction. It's important to keep in mind that each of the islands is not its own isolated puzzle, like Myst's four Ages; you go back and forth a TON. If you don't like backtracking, do not play this game. I guarantee you will hate it.Actually, there's lots of reasons to hate this game. Nigh-invisible buttons and pathways you have to click-hunt for? Check. Missing obvious things because the interface won't let you look at them? Check. Unlike Myst, you have to really know the tropes and techniques of adventure games to play it without guidance. When you get stuck, boredom sets in quickly. And the hell of it is, sometimes you don't know you're stuck, and you wander around trying minute variations on the same things over and over again to no visible effect. The feeling of progression is totally absent. And in the end everything you do is just in search of codes to a few combination locks.When this was originally released it came on 5 CDs. FIVE. That was way cool to me back then but I never managed to get very far and now I'm starting to remember why. I'm almost ready to give up on it even without having to physically switch out discs constantly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												losts of great reviews about this game, wish i would of found out it was still pictures.... click to point not so fun for me. also a bit pricy for what ya get, i personally think it should be mabye a 1.99 game at most. game crashes frequently on my alienware14 windows 7 computer making it really difficult to get into.another thing there are no instructions on waht to do you just aimlessly roam in the begining,not fun at all for this guy. butttt if you like older pc games and like spending too much for them this is your game.

												Go to Riven age if you are brilliant and brave and patient and big hearted. On Riven they are not. They are nasty to you, take your things, run away, and play the wailing, rotating Kazoo from towers when they see you come. Then they hide. There is nobody to hold your hand. You will face the Myst-mystery rehashed many a time: what the xxxx is this? What the xxxx is this then? Or this. It is all turned off, of course and needs to be turned on, buttons, levers, dials. You are the repair man. Nobody answers you. Nobody pays you. Somewhere in there you encounter a book that rants and tries to explain. Maybe it is meant as an apology by someone who cannot be coherent, who hallucinates, imagines all sorts of people that are not there. Maybe you can guess a thing or two, too: the guy in white runs away because he is ashamed that he cannot pay your salary. You cannot eat his nuts. They are unclickable.There are difficulties in places which will maybe yield by putting together two and two found in other places, if you look carefully. You don't know when you have the two and two, or what you have. Should you? You have a book. It is useless.Like the mind, your age is scattered about. You explore two-dimensional projections of a presumably three-dimensional age! Sometimes you have more projections surrounding you, sometimes less, to account for what is there. You click your controller to find out how many directions you can look today, to switch from projection to another! Your mind reels trying to connect the dots and establish in the minds I the true three dimensional age from these slices you are allowed to see. A walkway leads somewhere. Where does it lead? Where does it come from? If only you could rotate the head in a smooth, elegant fashion and 360 degrees, so much would become clear. But clickety click, your age is disjoint and made of whiplash. Sometimes you can click left, right, sometimes only back. The world has become a constrained manifold with unintuitive metrics. Sometimes you have to think to close doors to explore more. Why would you close doors, the manifold is so constrained already? You want an open age. You cannot even climb on rocks. Your eyes start to tear at the glaring pixels from a past age. It is a slideshow with moving parts that once came on 5 rotating disks. The five is a very significant number and exists as number of points in a star too.Sometimes in this senile delirium the age has a hickup and freezes altogether. You have to exit the age beforehand to fix, and immerse yourself in Myst of Task Explorer and Affinities of Processor Units. Then, one day you find a jail cell. There is somebody there! But he vanishes. You discover teleportation after a dark tunnel, by click you return to place that makes no sense to be there. In any case then you have permanently lost your submarine and can no longer go to school. To earlier time fragment you go, if you can. Such ages shouldn't be written, neither sold. It is an age past, belonging to museum.It is sometimes said all problems are human problems. In Riven, humans disappear and leave their problems to you, like so much garbage.To modern age we go.--- Editor's spoiler: Most of the claims in the above review are factual, as anybody who has played the game will instantly recognize. Some remarks are interpretation to fill in the gaps left by Riven's patchy narrative. If you understand the review and do not mind the various unintended challenges the game poses for anybody trying to run it in 2017 on a modern computer and a modern mindset, then by all means, give it a try.

												Rightly adored by fans of the original. I had never managed to play Riven until adulthood; while I might be blind to Myst's flaws, the sequel would not be getting the benefit of rose-colored glasses. Though full-motion video comes across as occasionally laughable or awkward, the increased live-action acting for PC games was absolutely innovative at the time, and does serve the story well. Riven is not quite as contemplative as Myst, but there's a little frisson of danger towards unseen enemies and an increased sense of isolation or loneliness when you see villagers scattering at your presence.The puzzles are fun, mind-bending, and story-relevant. At least one will make you feel clever and accomplished for having solved it. There is the occasional maddening lack of direction (e.g., a doorway hidden by a separate door), but the same openness mostly seems fair, allowing you to move yourself and the plot along without feeling railroaded. There's also a handy 'zip mode' for fast travel through areas that have been explored.The environments are beautiful, desolate and lush and strange. The culture that created the buildings and objects you find are still hanging around, and getting to explore one, consistent Age shows off the designers' high attention to detail in set dressing. The soundtrack keeps to the prompt of beautiful and atmospheric, but appropriately thematic, also more menacing and distressing than the Myst audio.The plot is serviceable, but really only compelling if you buy into the D'ni/Atrus/Catherine backstory and arcs, which you can easily overlook. However, the game has such great atmosphere and universe-building, and those fiendish puzzles, that the simple plot isn't much of a flaw.A great stand-alone, and a worthy episode in the series.

												Dreadful, point and click game. Nothing like Myst, to say it is the sequel. Poor graphics for a start, but none of the fluidity of the original, so most of the puzzle of the original is lost. Don't bother with this poor excuse of a game.			",27,30,3,5,14,0,13

												In my 10 hours (which is about how long it takes to finish the game if you're used to this genre) I've never had it crash, once, so I don't know what all the anger surrounding that ""issue"" is.  I will say this - the visuals are better than Myst, but if you're going for storyline (which you probably are if you're interested in this game) go for Myst instead.  Riven is still a good follow up, though, just not quite so... satisfying.  And we can hopefully forget about Myst 3.			",21,3,0,0,2,0,3

												When I was a young lad, my dad and I would play this game called Myst. It was addicting, puzzling, and all around beautiful. We've beaten the game several times, and to our dismay, it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. So when I heard that there were FOUR MORE Myst games. I had to take serious action. I brought Riven for 4 bucks and its been worth every cent. Not only does it resurrect many of the old timeless features of Myst, (Click on the hidden objects etc.) but adds new ones as well. The graphics, (while a bit outdated) are stunning. Considering they were made with the modern technology of their time. The puzzles never cease to confuse me. Which I suppose is what you look for in a good puzzler. Overall, the game play mechanics, the beautiful images, and the brilliantly designed puzzles, makes Riven live up to the good name Myst erected.However, the game doesn't work perfectly on Windows 7 unfortunately. Frequent crashes and game freezes aren't unheard of. But I suppose it wasn't really designed for an operating system as complex as Windows 7. ;-;  To avoid loosing your precious game progress, I recommend saving whenever you get the chance. Trust me, I've had my share of rage quits from a game-progress-deleting-crash. (GPDC) GPDC aside, I recommend a pen and paper, an event-less lazy weekend, a bag of chips, and occasional breaks. To fully enjoy this masterpiece of a game. Since this game wasn't designed for Windows 7, i'll put aside my crashing con. Aside from that, there's not that much else wrong with this game. I'll give it a  9.8/10			",21,4,0,3,1,0,4

												The game was beautiful and fantastic. Worked really well on my Windows 8.1 which was a big concern. I think it only crashed on me once in 12 hours of play and I ran into one bug that wasn't a huge deal so those concerned with stability you should be fine. Riven as a game is great and has an amazing story (play MYST first or the story will be lost on you.) Some of the puzzels in this game were insane. I REALLY don't like to use guides for a puzzle game (because that kills the fun right?) In some cases I felt as though a guide was needed. Even after having looked through a guide once I was stuck near one of the final puzzels part of the solution was ""you need to guess this part"" which I found silly seeing as how every other puzzle in both Myst and Riven you could work out logically. The game is still amazing, but I really don't get how anyone could finish the final puzzels without looking at a guide...maybe you are smarter then me and will find it a breeze...but beautiful, challenging, and perhaps a little frusterating this game holds up really well after nearly 20 years.

												Riven is an EPIC sequel to Myst. the visuals are even more beautiful and the worlds created within are fantastically fanciful and beyond normality. The extensive inclusion of real actors is fantastic, and I still can't figure out how they did some of those visual combinations back then. While this version is NOT in actual 3D like Real Myst, It's still a fantastic game. You may feel a little jarred going from the 3d of Real Myst back to the classic click to move to the next scene image, but after a while you'll get back into this perfectly nostalgia inducing classic. The puzzles are even more involved, and almost everything is a clue. Take EXTENSIVE notes on everything you can find. Visuals, sounds, colors, and even the location of the islands are all an important factor to help you unravel the mysteries and save Catherine.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

												This game was damn good back in the day. but it really needs an upgrade for modern computers. even thought i have 30+ hours on this game, most of it was from crashes and having the game stuck in a frozen in-game session. there have been rumors that this game might get remastered like the first one. but unless they had an incredibly powerful and top of the line game engine, i dont think they could ever salvage the games realistic look. that was the thing with point and click games. even though gameplay was limited they put a great deal of effort into the graphics and to this day the game looks AMAZING. if u still have a computer that can handle this games requirements and if you enjoyed the first myst game, get it. but as for owners of modern computers like myself as much as i want to keep going and brave through the crashes and freezes, this game has aged way too much. i just hope i dont have to wait another 17 years to finally finish it.

												I loved to play this game back in the late 90s because of the summer solstice like atmosphere of the Age of Riven. The experience of going through transitions between islands is like something you'd want to see on a virtual roller coaster ride. The complex numerical system was and is still complicated. Despite that, the experience is rewarding. The Wildlife can be considered the most iconic in the series. Cyan should recreate this game like they did when they made RealMyst and RealMyst Masterpiece Edition, replicating every bit of scenery and texture from the original. It's nice to relive this classic. However, I ran into a few glitches where the game crashed on me a few times and some of the sound has skipped. That's another reason I have my hopes up for a remake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, I""d recommend playing on a ScummVM daily build, even though the scrolling doesn't work, it almost never crashes unlike playing it directly through steam. ",64,22,4,14,11,1,14

												An amazing game, but I cannot recommend it due to it's unplayability on current operating systems. The game will stop responding and freeze your computer after around 5-30 minutes of gameplay. Buy at your own risk....but if you use Windows 98, then go for it!			",48,8,4,2,4,0,1

												Ahhh... Riven. It has been a long time since I've last played, and it felt great to play through it again. Especially so after reading through the 3 books. Will always recommend the Myst series to my fellow puzzle cravers. Be sure to bring a pencil and paper! If you have any hitches running this old game, be sure to check the Steam forums where Cyan has posted some workarounds!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the purest form of nostalgia. If you're looking for a great puzzle adventure game, this point-and-click world will pull you in with its photo-realistic scenery and keep you glued to your mouse while you uncover the mysteries within. For being a game from the late 90's, its very compressed, yet surprisingly stunning visuals, still hold up fairly well. The sounds and mechanics really immerse you in the world; from the flip of a book's page, to the clacking whirring of the tram cars as they zoom you from island to island.Several people have claimed to have problems on Windows 7 64-bit computers. My dual-core netbook running Windows 7 Home had zero problems. I set the launch options to '/affinity 1', and also set the game into 98/ME compatibility mode with every option checked. The only issue I came across was the game not recognizing my saves at first, but launching the game outside of Steam seemed to solve it.For $6 you really can't go wrong with Riven. Depending on how good you are at puzzle games, Riven can keep you immersed for several hours to several days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												STOP, STOP STOP. Do not download Cyan Complete Pack or any of these games. #1 Spelunx is a game from the 80's that is complete rubbish, not even todays 5 year old kids ould enjoy it#2 Cosmic Osmo is the same, black and white, looks like something from the 8 bit era#3 Manhole is utter garbage, also looks like something from the late 80's#4 Uru Complete Cronicals wont run, keep getting error message Application Lead Error: 5:0000065434...no idea#5 Myst V has terrible graphics and keeps crashing after a few min#6 RealMyst is a big improvement but crashed regardless. Pity as I was hoping to play this#7 Myst Masterpice is playable but with good old 640/480 res. Have only played for 5 min. no crash but argh, old graphics#8 Riven yipee, something worth playing and it actually works...at 800/600 resolution and locked up on me 3 times after 20 min or so each time. Make sure you save as there is no auto save.You need to have Apple Quicktime player installed as well or most of these wont even launch.Save your money. Dont spend it here. Steam wont give it back. You will be conned and ripped off!!!!You have been warned ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic. However, I do not reccomend downloading this game from Steam if you are running anything modern. Save your six dollars and buy something that will actually work. I thought this would be fun to play without switching discs as you did when playing the five disc version of 1997; but again, it doesn't work. The 1.4 hours I have logged as play time has all been the first cut scene over and over again as it crashes directly after. Although one time I did get to actually walk before it eventually crashed. I have tried using a VirtualBox but that was too complicated to figure out for a game that is planning on a re-release (with no set release date) and if you would like to look into that it can be found by searching for the Starry Expance Project on your browser. Please only read on if you have the five disc version of the game, have a system that runs Mac OSx, and cannot wait any longer for ""realRiven"" which has already been in the making for over six years.When looking for ways to play my Riven discs again without getting a VirtualBox for Windows 95, I stumbled apon a thing called ""Riven X."" Now either I'm the stupidest person on earth, or the page which origonally hosted Riven X no longer supports downloads. Either way, just by searching for a download, I found it. After finishing the download all I had to do was put the discs into my computer and it automatically copied all the files into the program. I never have to switch discs again and it looks very good and functions so very smoothly. I highly reccomend this way of playing. At least until the remake, realRiven, is released (which will be on Steam)! Good luck!			",60,10,0,17,4,0,6

												I love to play the game but this download is crap. Won't play in window, crash alot, can't ""start saved game"" so you have to lisen to the start every time the open your saved game. If you save your game and it freezes up, you just lost your game, have fun starting over. You can go though alot of stuff fine, everything works right, then you lose your game, start over and nothing work right, so you start over and over and over again. I have been playing this game for 5 days now and have restarted it over 12 times. I have the game on CD's from the late 90's, I just wish I could us them.			",3,3,0,0,4,0,0

												For most people, including myself, you'll probably play this game for a couple hours and then get stuck and not know how to progress.Be very cautious before you choose to look up a walkthrough to get help, there's a good chance you'll become dependent on that and need to ""cheat"" so often that you might as well just watch a lets play or walkthrough of the game.I only recommend that you get this game if you loved Myst and have a ton of patience and time. It can be a very satisfying game to figure out.			",71,25,1,6,2,0,7

												ClassicI have never seen a game with such limitations for it's time carry out such an amazing delivery of a worldThe visuals are certainly dated and it's quite obvious when an FVM is overlayed on a static image and in certain fullscreen FMVs you can count the pixels on screen but none the less it is still an amazing adventure and puzzle game and for $6.50 (CAD) it's certainly worth it			",108,6,1,6,9,0,11

												I am probably the only one who remembers this game but I loved it as a kid. It's probably the most accessible game of the Myst series. It's eerily beuatiful. the down side is apparently they changed nothing about the game so it looks like it's running exactly like how it did in 1995.			",176,92,4,24,25,2,15

												Of all the Myst games ever made, Riven is by far my favorite. Compared to Myst, it had more complex and sweeping visuals, deep and diverse sound design, and a strong story to carry the player along. The puzzles are challenging and fun, and the soundtrack is atmospheric and compelling. The later Myst games attempted to improve upon the format with whiz-bang visuals and more fully explorable 3D environments, and while they are all certainly great games, Riven is the classic and the best.
