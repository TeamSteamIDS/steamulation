												Short and fairly easy puzzle game, but its puzzles were actually logical and no horrible sticking points.  It focused on cooperation between characters, and had a cute/silly story and cartoony look.  Good choice if you like adventure games but get annoyed with harder or less logical ones.  Definitely more a light snack than a meal though.			",208,79,1,63,25,2,50

												Emmensely entertaining, this retro-style point and click adventure has humour aplenty suitable for all ages. The puzzles while interesting and entertaining are not so difficult you get frustrated with the game. There are a few trickier ones hidden throughout towards the later part of the game, but they are spread out to keep it fresh rather than to see what your IQ level is and succeeding at making most of us feel stupid as many of the old adventure games delighted in doing (or so it seemed).  With clean graphics, voice acted humans and for written quips and mesages from your Bots as they go on adventures, it is sure to keep you with a contented smile and maybe a few well-humoured grins. Definitely worth the purchase price as is on Steam. (Though if you go grab the currently humbelbundle as of this writing -4/25/2014- for the weekly sale, you can grab this game and a few more for as little as one dollar donation! THough of course, donations can be any ammount you choose from 1.00 and up to get the Steam keys for it. (Don't know what humble bundle is? Go to www.humblebundle.com and check it out for yourself).  In short, I recommend this game highly for a casual fun, story driven experience. It is great for those rainy days, causal relation sundays or just when you want to game after a long day of work or school but not be wrapped up for too long at a stretch. One of the other nice features of the game is your ability to save at any time during play (after cut scenes). This makes being able to pick it up and put it down again extra nice for those who may have to run on a minute's notice. None of the cutscenes are overlong, so that also adds to the fun as they add to the story rather than make you roll your hand or drum your fingers in a thoroughly ""Hurry up!"" manner. Again, excellent fun game, with almost zero learning curve. Every bot you get has to pass three level-tests, to make sure you understand their abilities. Then as quickly as that they are in with your regular crew. It has taken me no longer than two minutes to get all of my bots on their tests. You couldn't ask for a easier learning curve or easier to remember what layout for what bot does what. No need to try and decode secret abilities.  If you have not had the opportunity to pick up this game, do so. True, replayability is not top of the motivations for getting this game-but it is enough fun that you will want to keep coming back to it every so often after you have beaten it, in the same way the ""Monkey Island""series has become a gamer cult classic, it would not surprise me to find Puzzle Bots as another of the point and click adventure gamer cult classics in times to come.

												This game took me by surprise.It ended up in my library through some bundle and I didn't play it for the longest time.I'm glad that I did though, as it is positively delightful.The game follows 5 miniature robots who, after each having been invented by a different inventor at a research company, begin to explore and question their surroundings. Meanwhile (sometimes literally) in the background a larger story is taking place where the inventors question the motives and past of their employer, have crushes and dreams and in general feel very human.The game has full voice acting for the human characters and cute robot sounds for the robots, it's clearly not AAA-budget voice acting but it's actually really good and I was consistently entertained and swept along by it.The puzzles, which are linear and progressively more complex, are nice little one-screen environmental puzzles where the various abilities of your 5 little heroes is put to the test. The solutions are all pretty easy to figure out (maybe with the exception of one of the final puzzles, which required some more timing than I was used to until then), but that didn't detract from the enjoyment I was getting from it at all.Charming. That would be the one-word review of this game. It wraps up nicely, doesn't outstay its welcome and oozes personality (which is impressive considering you're controlling a (literal) handful of robots).A perfect example on how to make a neat game without having access to a huge budget, and something I'd recommend to everybody.

												Worth 5 dollars? sure. It's short, cute and not too difficult. I'd say it's perfect for a kid. and not your inner child..an acctual child. The 'puzzles' are really simplistic and strait forward with 5 different adorible robots that do very strait forward things and nothing but those things. In my opinion the end was poorly done based on the previous pace of the game, they go from being obvious to being abstract right at the end which confused me and caused me to take longer at the end. My real issue with this game is I worked till the end beat it..then the game automatically fastforwarded through all of the end dialog so I got none of the end story. If you have a child you want to get out of your hair for a while with something minimally thought provoking but not brainless, then I'd get them this. However if you yourself are looking for something there are better things out there for 5 dollars or for free. (I picked it up in the humble bundle so I can't complain too much.)

												A rather cute point and click adventure game featuring a band of robots each with a unique skill. It's quite short, it does have some collectibles to pick up and it does luckily autosave. I say luckily, because having gotten rather stuck on one puzzle I alt tabbed out of the game only to find this apparently equated to shutting the game down. It also turned out that the reason I was stuck was sadly because the puzzle had glitched and become unsolvable and the autosave fixed that... albeit by resetting the puzzle. It is very cute though and if the price seems right for (at most) a couple of hours of vague entertainment (or possibly more if you sit a small child in front of it) then it's worth a look.

												Some really cool puzzles involving character switching in this one.  It's sort of a story-driven point and click adventure.  The voiced banter between the human characters is quite enjoyable, and there's TONS of hidden writing and dialogue.It's a short-ish game (could take you like 4 hours I suppose) but it's a charming game from start to finish.

												Puzzle Bots is a short (~2 hours) and sweet childish point and click puzzle game where you control different robots each with a unique ability in order to solve puzzles in the environments. The puzzles are not too challenging so it's perfect towards the younger crowd, but overall it's a simple, relaxing and lighthearted game with a storyline that meshes well for this game.

												Puzzle Bots™ is a charming gem that pushes all conventional genre boundries and shatters every expectation with it's unique and challenge approach to the Yearly Unique Keen Autism Required Ingrates (YUKARI) Program sponsored game series.Who wouldn't want an adorable little robot of their own? Thankfully, Dr. Hugo's Factory for Making Robots is here to help. The company makes cute little mechanical companions of all sorts, from robotic mermaids to walking flamethrowers. But something is not quite right with Dr. Hugo, so the robots take it upon themselves to find out just what's going on. In Wadjet Eye's Puzzle Bots you'll get to control a gang of five robots as they search the factory, solving puzzles and getting into trouble. The result is an incredibly charming adventure, packed with plenty of humor and some deviously clever puzzles.The strange thing about Dr. Hugo's Factory for Making Robots is that, aside from Dr. Hugo himself, there are only five employees. And each one of these young inventors has built exactly one robot. When one the inventors stumbles upon a mysterious metal box that can't be opened, the robot team decides to sneak out to try and open it themselves. They end up uncovering a devious plot threatening the whole company, involving hidden cameras, lost toys, and lots of lasers. The game features a uniquely charming sense of humor, especially when it comes to the goofy cast of characters, both human and robotic. You'll come across numerous, hilarious geek references, and the dialog is as silly as it is endearing.Thankfully, Puzzle Bots has much more going for it than just its goofy sense of humor. The game plays out a lot like a traditional adventure game, but with a heavy emphasis on puzzle solving. You'll be controlling all five robots -- who are introduced one at a time at the beginning of the game -- and each has a different ability. Hero, for example, is the only robot who can pick up objects, while Ultraboy bears a striking resemblance to a bulldozer, and thus can push heavy items around. Most of the puzzle will require you to utilize all of the different abilities of your robot team in order to find the right answer.For the most part the puzzles aren't too difficult, but they do require you to pay close attention to your surroundings and make use of all of the abilities at your disposal. There is a recharging hint system in place as well, which doesn't tell you exactly what to do, but instead provides subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) tips to push you in the right direction. Unfortunately, there are a few hair-pulling moments of frustration, where it'll take some time to figure out exactly what you're supposed to do. In these instances it's usually easy to figure out what needs to be done, but figuring out how to do it is another thing entirely.A lot of what makes the game so charming simply boils down to the fact that everything is so small. Since you're viewing the world from the perspective of the robots, who themselves areabout the size of a small rodent, even everyday objects appear huge and daunting. They also take on new functions. A coffee maker becomes a spaceship, while a book can become a bridge. The robots are also delightfully clueless when it comes to humans. When two of the main characters kiss for the first time, one robot remarks ""maybe they're doing battle.""Further emphasizing the game's undeniable charm, is its wonderful, cartoon visual style. Puzzle Bots looks like a playable Nickelodeon show, with bright colors and a delightful, hand-drawn style. As a bonus, you'll also get to see some gorgeous posters of each of the five robots created by superbly talented artists like Harvey James and David Hellman. And you can also collect special hidden items throughout the game, which give you access to solid amount of interesting concept art. It should also be noted that Puzzle Bots has some great voice acting, as the spoken dialog really helps add to the game's humor and lend some personality to the characters. The robots, in particular, sound adorable, communicating via a series of R2-D2 style beeps and boops.There are a few technical problems that you'll experience throughout the game, though they're mostly minor. The animation is a little wonky at times, which is frustrating given the game's cartoon style presentation. And occasionally the music will skip, which tends to happen mostly when the game is shifting scenes. Thankfully, these aspects are pretty easy to ignore and don't do much to detract from the overall experience.Puzzle Bots is both light-hearted and challenging and features one of the rarest of videogame characteristics: a great sense of humor. It's the kind of game that will have you smiling almost the entire time you're playing. The story is silly but well written, and the puzzles are challenging and only occasionally frustrating. It's hard to ask for much more from an adventure game, except, maybe, for a little robot of your own.Pros:    Goofy but charming sense of humor. Adorable cartoon style presentation and great voice acting. Clever puzzles make great use of robot theme.Cons:    Puzzles are occasionally unclear. Music frequently skips in-between scenes.FINAL VERDICT: 4/5 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just finished this. It's nice. Very reminiscent of the old point & click games, though not as long and with more logical solutions (these sorts of games were usually ""guess the answer the developer was thinking of). The main feature is using different characters who have their own (single) special ability. It's not exactly lost vikings, but somewhat similar.Despite the clean puzzle designs (e.g.: it usually makes clear which paths go nowhere) and the good pacing (the characters are nicely introduced and puzzles get progressively harder), it's actually the story that is the most engaging. It has good and charming humour, and a bit of mystery that keeps you playing and guessing what's next.The main gripe I have with the game is that I definately no longer fit within the target audience for this. This is the sort of game I'd recommend parents buying for their children: it's non-violent, fun, keeps them engaged and tangentially (if that's a word) learns them about teamwork. Hardcore gamers should definately stay away, though. :)			",378,123,7,30,42,4,64

												This seems like the sort of thing I'd like, different robots with different abilities working together to solve puzzles, but it's too short and the puzzles never become difficult.  Also it's a bit boring to have to move all the robots, the same problems as Lost Vikings, but not quite as lively.It's worth pointing out that this a sequel to a freeware game with identical gameplay and equivalent length.  I would recommend playing that first.			",142,142,1,44,18,1,48

It's a fun puzzle game where you have to solve puzzles using multiple robots.I do think there should've been a 'play in window' option in the game. It looks hideous full screen.

												Puzzle Bots is a point & click adventure game designed by Erin Robinson (famous for her indie game Spooks and Little Girl in Underland), however this game has much more in common with one of her other games that goes by the name of Nanobots.You start as Hero, the pick-up bot and are soon joined by Ultrabot (the toughest bot) and soon find yourself exploring the world around you from the eyes of a new-born robot. You'll later be joined by a whole host of other robots who each have their own special abilities, which will come in handy as you explore further into the world.The graphics are cute and the illustrations are provided by some famous illustrators including contributions from Harvey James of Kotaku fame.Some of the music tracks are really good, but where the game really excels is in its voice-overs; something you should by now really ought to expect from Wadjet Eye games.To finish then, the game is about loving cooperation, and is yet another gem in Wadjet Eye's growing IP archive.If you're interested, here's my video review:

												A cute, story-driven puzzle game designed for an all-ages audience. The puzzles themselves are logical and fairly straightforward, rewarding the player with cute animations and scenes from a light romance and mystery story that, while not Shakespeare, are still amusing to watch.It is short, and it's no Incredible Machine-- if you're looking for something really challenging or based on Rube Goldberg contraptions, you won't find it here. If you want something that will tickle your brain rather than tease it mercilessly, give this one some consideration.			",329,171,5,50,21,4,59

												This game is for children, I'm sure if I was a kid I'd like the game, maybe... But I'm not. This game is hardly a puzzle game and it's definatly not worth $5, I'm just glad I got it in the Humble Bundle and I didn't pay full price. The story is uninteresting and boring, puzzles are either way too easy or head-bashingly frivolous and have no logic, the quality of the graphics are god-aweful and inconsistant(Why are the robots like 16bit sprites and the rest of the game looks like a drawn cartoon world?). The game is amazingly short, I beat it within less than an hour, I've played free flash games long than this game. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I strongly recommend against buying this game.

												This game is good. It's not close to the level of the other Wadjet Eye-published games, but it's not really trying to be. This is a kids' game with a cartoon plot and cartoon humor. That's not to say it does what it's doing badly. There's a lot of lampshade hanging and parody of this kind of genre, it's very clearly self-aware. The puzzles are on the easy side of things pretty much the entire way through and the curve of puzzle difficulty is pretty smooth, adding more complexity the further the game progresses until you have 5 different bots to work with by the end. It's not very long, though (2 or so hours) but it's about as long as it really needs to be. Lighthearted and mildly enjoyable, I'd say this is worth getting cheap, though maybe not full price.

I feel this game would be better suited for kids, including the plot and jokes. Would only recommend if buying for a child, at a price of $5 or lower.			",413,90,4,68,72,4,71

												Well that was a cute game. Basic point and click adventure game with a 'Scooby Doo' esque story. Mildly entertaining and about 2 hours long.The puzzles dont get to complex so its a pretty laid back playthrough. Depending on the price you should grab it.			",271,45,1,57,28,2,30

												Puzzle Bots is a ""my first point-n-click adventure"" game for children. The plot follows tiny robots that get into cartoonish misadventures when their much larger human owners aren't looking. The puzzles are simple and definitely geared towards children, and the love-triangle story of the robot's humans made me want to run a drill through my head.I wouldn't recommend this for anyone over 13 years old. Under that, however, it might be a decent game for $5.2 out of 5 foxes.			",252,85,5,23,8,4,11

												Below average puzzle game which I wish had more polish. The game starts out great, art style is nice, characters are fun and the dialog leads you to believe that they're will be quite a bit of interaction with these characters. However, instead of a fun jurney, the developers decided to take the lazy route and force a very, very dumb and short story which ultimately ruined the game for me. It's short, way too short, like only 25% of what I expected to see. The sad part is that all the charm which got me to play the game was lost around the end. The dialogs went from funny to... oh my god they're serious with this and why the ♥♥♥♥ did the little robot ""hero"" had to talk? The voice they chose was horrible. I couldn't bare to listen any of his lines due to the way he talked. Mechanically the game is ok-ish. Something which I found extremely annoying is that you can not cancel commands(really annoying during the toy house stage) and that you can't change between characters using the keyboard. I ran across 1 game breaking bug during the toy house stage where hero would get stuck on the stairs, meaning that you had to repeat everything(good thing the game has auto saves). And some visual bugs during the last few stages. They aren't anything big but I think they deserved a mention. The options menu is limited, no resolutions option is present or master volume scroll or any options for that matter.Now let me say some good things about the game. The beginning is fun, you immediately begin to like the characters and want to get to know them better (sadly you don't get that chance). The robots have their own personalities which are also fun but they don't get enough attention. Only the main robot ""hero"" gets all of the attention and main interaction and that's such a missed opertunity. Having more levels with character interactions would've created a bond between the player and the characters which would've led to a very satisfying end because you have something to remember the game. You're sadly just left with a forced love triangle which you're barely given enough time to give a crap about....I was supposed to talk about the good things about the game but all of the charm ended up with a bitter taste and there's no point talking about mechanics because there's no physics involved or anything. It feels like a 1994-2003 indie title.The only good thing I can say about the game is that young children may enjoy it, just make sure to keep lighters away from them in case they get any wrong impressions from Kelvin. 3.5/10 from me.

												I got this game form a HumbleBundle, so no major complaints.  This should not be an E rated game, it should be KO rated for kids only.  The acting is not even remotely good for an adult audience.  This should be marketed to kids.  They should, if they haven't, turn this into an application for the kids tablets and the Kindle.  With this being said, it is worth having in your library for when a couple of young kids come over to your house.  Other than that, I would pass.  I wouldn't dismiss another game from these guys though.  They should make one geared for adults, maybe with some logic thrown into it.  I liked the simple animation in this game, I just wish that I would have been warned that it was a kids game.  Also, there is no plot until the very end, which I do not particularly mind.

												Puzzle Bots is a 2D puzzle game that is filled to the brim with character goofiness and charm.  If there is anything this game did right, it is proper humor for the casual audience it is intended for. The story is pretty well written for a short game, and the voice acting is spot on. The one thing I did not like in Puzzle bots was the non-existence of hints of any kind. Some of these puzzles were super elaborate, so in some cases it will be a guess and check ordeal too see if the you are solving the puzzles correctly. Overall it was very difficult to find any fault with this game, other than the fact it probably won’t appeal to the “hardcore” audience.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												As a person with not a lot of time for gaming and not too much patience either, I like to collect short games. Clocking in at about 3 hours of play time, this one is a good choice for those who like puzzle adventure games.Pros: Fun storyline, entirely voice-actedPuzzles just barely hard enough that you can trial and error your way through with some cleverness, without a need for a walkthroughClever environmentsA lot of heartA good hint system that doesn't give too much awayCons:A strange bug that causes all the dialog in a cutscene to be skipped, so you have to restart the game to see it.Some small interface issues unintuitiveness that can get you stuck even after you have solved a puzzleInability to zoom out to see the whole environment at one time gets annoyingMany of the puzzles are just a wee bit too easy.I'd give it a 6/10 on the whole.

Plus, the hint system is good that it forces you to wait between hints, but doesn't make you feel like you're stuck on a scene for a long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although flawed, Puzzle Bots is a very enjoyable game that every adventure game afficionado should try.It's easy to be deterred by the game's shortcomings.  It's a short game, and if you know what you're doing, you can finish it in just a few hours.  The graphics and animation, while charming, are underwhelming.  The story is almost entirely back-loaded, leaving you wondering what Dr. Hugo is thinking for almost the whole game, and introducing important characters and plot elements only at the very end, causing all but the most alert players to need to play through it again in order to understand the whole story.However, another playthrough is not something you're going to mind.  The gameplay is easy to get into, and should be instantly familiar to anyone who enjoys the classic Lucasarts and Sierra adventure games.  The characters are memorable and likable, and their dialogue is hilarious.  The puzzles are, for the most part, both logical and whimsical.  Each level has a different feel to it, and you're likely to want to save at the beginning of one or two just to have the satisfaction of playing through them all over again.Is Puzzle Bots perfect?  No, but it is fun, and worth your money and time.			",277,161,3,59,40,3,35

												Puzzle Bots is a nice little point and click. Very cute with an interesting yet simple plot. Most of the puzzles are relatively straight forward but there are some real head scratchers in there and the final puzzle is a doozy! Nice and bright with simple and colourful animation. Voice acting good with some funny parts that give you the odd chuckle. If you're just wanting a little something to pass the time with the odd head scratcher thrown in with enough things to keep you interested, and a low price tag, this will probably be for you and will be quite universal. However if you are looking for more of a challenge where you really have to think outside the box this will probably be too easy for you and not scratch that itch. The use of the bots was easy, however ocassionally it can be irritating when you have to switch between them quickly (you will know where I mean when you get to it).I got this as part of a point and click puzzle pack and as a whole I thought it was a really nice, well made casual game that I could dip in and out of.

												I have no idea how this ended up in my list, I suspect one of the usual bundles pulled it in. I'm currently on my endless mission to actually install, test and categorize all those games in my too long list. From the name, description and screenshots, I would not have touched this game, but I currently force myself to play every game at least a couple of minutes to find out, if the gameplay might be a jewel or if I like anyhting about it. Most of those games end up as further reference in one of my categories. This game, however, hooked me up for some reason and I finished it.I'm not sure what kept me going. The puzzles are very basic, the mechanics are simple and the human characters are annoying. It must have been the robots. They are too cute, they have almost more depth than the human protagonists. I could not stop playing until I knew what happened with those little guys.The game is rather short. Of those 4 hours on my clock, 1 hour was preparing a meal and eating and about half an hour was being stuck at one puzzle towards the end, because I didn't observe the environment carefully enough. The puzzles are not very challenging, but the few that actually require some thinking will get you pants down, because your brain is calibrated to simple stuff.I can recommend this game to children and to everybody who has a heart for robots.
