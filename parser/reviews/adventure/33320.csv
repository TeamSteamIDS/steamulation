												Forgotten Sands is one of the best games in the Prince of Persia series, very underrated. The acrobatic platforming is amazing, mixing up powers like freezing water, making parts of the ruins reappear and rewinding time, some sequences are hard and may require flawless timing. Sadly, the story is not the best with some average combat but I do recommend this game. ",1429,357,48,109,85,17,150

												If you're a fan of the Sands of Time or Warrior Within then this game is a mustn't have!The game takes you back seamlessly to the Princes brother's kingdom in Azad (Did you know he had a brother? I didn't know he had a brother!) where you go through the necessary tutorials to understand just how awful the controls in this game are. The basic controls are all there; jump, roll, strike, run up walls... block isn't one of them, because apparently it isn't useful when you're fighting several dozen enemies at once, with an arrogant sword combo so slow it gives you an extra half second every strike just to appreciate how much you hate the game. Oh and it's just the one weapon, no several weapons, no stealing them from monsters, or using them to throw at enemies, or infact throwing enemies at other enemies (Come on, we all did it), no instead the Prince relies on a much more effective stategy of kicking them. Yep kicking them, oh and apparently all that awesome jumpy acrobatic mid air strikes stuff just wasn't cool enough to continue. Then again this is probably for the best as Prince has difficulty moving correctly because the controls are so poorly calibrated (or at least different from the previous 3 games) made worse by the AWFUL automatic camera showing you various angles of walls and the Prince's♥♥♥♥♥♥instead of useful stuff like obsticles or enemies. Merits: Good Story, good boss characters, some new obstaclesPitfalls: Everything else.I got this game on sale and I still feel ripped off. This is the kind of game that makes you want to slap the whole of Ubisoft in the face.			",27,2,1,3,0,0,0

												The polar opposite of Prince of Persia (2008), instead of fighting one enemy at a time, you fight hordes upon hordes of enemies, you have your time powers back, its not cel-shaded, and you don't have some lady sidekick following you around. I don't need an escort for my parkour mistakes, I HAVE RECALL FOR THAT!Apparently the Prince has been working on some new parkour techniques after SoT, but then forgot them in WW, (guess thats why its called Forgotten Sands) because in this game, you can infinitely wall jump, which now wall runs a bit, and then wall jump again, rinse and repeat, you get the point. Also, he must of got some beauty sleep because he looks pretty suave, and then in WW, he must of took an ugly dirt nap or something, cause in WW he looks worse than he did in SoT.This game has a pretty cool new mechanic in which you can make water solid for a short period of time, such as waterfalls, and jets of water, to make walls to wallrun and jump across, and to make poles of solid water to swing on respectively.And um... other things.... I assume theres other powers and whatnot, but honestly this is somehow the LEAST memorable PoP game. Probably because I only played through it once, then again I only played through PoP 2008 once, and I remember way more in that than I do this, mainly cause them cel-shaded environments, lack of time powers (yeah, it probably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off enough to make me remember it more), and overly dramatic one on one battles, and its wacko ending.Also, theres a giant boss at the end where you're on a really sketchy platform in the sand, HAVE FUN!

												This Prince of Persia 1.5 (or a pre-sequel between 'Sands of Time' and 'Warrior Within') plays like a breeze and lets you do all you ever wanted with the Prince (vertical wall runs, rock climbing and special powers like invulnerability and area of effect ice and fire magic, etc...). Sure it's not as expansive or hard as the sequels and the combat system is rather inferior but the game is better and longer than I expected, with 2 new ingenious game mechanics involving freezing water and recalling ancient structures one by one whille you jump through waterfalls and disappearing pillars...And you can actually play as Ezio from Assassin's Creed 2, now that's fan service!

												WAIT TO SEE WHAT I HAVE TO SAYI'm a fan of PoP, warrior within being my favorite, if you already played a PoP game you'll understand easily what I want to sayIf you're only going to play for the platform part of jumping and running on walls, go ahead and give that game a try ! The platform part was great, you can freeze the water (freeze time for the water) which opens a totally new door for platforming. Sometime you have to freeze a fall to run on it, jump, unfreeze water to pass through a second fall and freeze it again to grab a column of water. It was really great, I had a nice timeHOWEVER, the reason why I don't recommend it is the fighting part... I was so much very a lot deceive by it. (mark my words)... In Warrior Within you had many combos, you could jump on the wall onto the ennemies, grab them break their neck and steal their weapon... great time ! The Forgotten Sands is freaking lame, you have to attack buttons, weak attack, or a stronger version of that attack, NO COMBO, NO VARIETY, NO FUN... So sad, the fighting part was no complete and incredibly dull...the fighting makes the game a bad game, but if you're willing to go over it and only play for the platforming, go ahead !

												It is a good game. The puzzle platforms are great, the cenarios are beatiful remembering the ones from The Two Thrones, the songs are forgetable, the story is ok and the battle system is lame, but at least there aren't many fights and they are over really quick. Let's talk about the powers. You can rewind time like on the other Prince of Persia games and now you can level up the prince and use four new spells. You can leave a trail of fire, create an impenetrable armor of sand, send forth shards of ice with each attack and release winds to push enemies back. Besides that there is a genie that will give you the hability to freeze water, materialize structures that were destroyed and jump long distances over an enemy target, which are all used for the puzzle platforms. There aren't many types of enemies and they are all super easy to kill, there is no challenge at all at killing things. There is no fancy move list, you start with the same lame slash attacks, a jump attack, a kick and with them you'll end the game. They send lots of enemies at once making it fell like you are stomping ants, but at least it is not as bad as the battle system from the PoP 2008 which also had an awful platform system. Summarizing, battle bad, but berable and platform good as it should be in a PoP game.			",254,44,4,33,16,0,22

												Highly underrated game. Its acrobatic platforming is smoother, better balanced and with a greater sense of flow and action than all of the previous games. It may not have the same charm and the rich story and character interactions of Sands of Time, but for my money its gameplay alone makes it one of the best of the franchise. I suspect the reason people were so critical of this game was simply because it was released as a tie-in to the disappointing movie.			",105,29,3,4,3,0,4

												The Forgotten Sands is nothing like the PoP-Trilogy, even though it is set after ""Sands of Time"". The game is ignoring everything the previous games did right and it feels like a generic game for the stupid mass. -) The Prince's movements are not smooth, they are rough and not fitting.-) I know most of his movements are impossible in real life, but jumping against a wall, pausing and THEN start to run up the wall? COME ON!-) What happened to the fighting system? There are no combos, no special time abilities, nothing! The only thing you have to to is smashing X and and once in a while all the other buttons. WTH Ubisoft?-) The story is lame, average sequel story-crap, predictable and plain stupid. -) Sometimes the Prince is making a funny comment, but if you expect witty comments or dialogs like in ""Two Thrones"" , you'll be greatly disappointed.All in All: If you liked or loved the original Prince of Persia Trilogy, DONT BUY ""Forgotten Sands"", it's a waste of time and money. Hopefully, Ubisoft will find a way back to their former quality...			",164,39,2,4,9,1,14

												One of the most beautiful and spectacular games I've ever played. An interactive fairy tale, a challenge for your fingers, a treat for your eyes, and a few thoughts for your mind as well. If you're tired of ugly, mean, violent and criminal games - this one will feel like a vacation. Fights are fun, not too difficult, as it is not the most important part of the gameplay. The character movements are realistic, voice acting is very good, the story is solid. As a fan of the original Prince Of Persia game from 1990, I was impressed by how close the gameplay follows the original concept.			",197,132,5,19,11,2,15

												To all the naysayers: This game does not deserve it's ""mixed"" rating. It's a great game and it's even a good PoP game. I literally can't find much fault here. The game is unpatched (v 1.00) yet I've encountered not a single bug. The prince moves and fights smoothly and responds well to commands. I've only encountered a handful of times in which I wanted to do something that he did not (usually that's wall jump instead of wall run or vice versa, which has always been a problem). There's everything here that makes an interesting game: good platforming, interesting mechanics, devious traps and relatively diverse combat, though this is still the weakest part of the game (but thankfully after having played Sands of Time right before this one it's nowhere near as bad and actually quite enjoyable). People complain that there is no block button...you don't need it in this game. Simple as that.The platforming is extremely smooth and there are enough mechanics introduced throughout the game (about 8 hours in total) that it won't get boring. You have a few boss fights, mini bosses, etc. The story is actually rather interesting as well, though here is my one and only real gripe with the game...it's a pre-sequel. It's PoP 1.5 instead of PoP 4 for example or just an entirely new game. It interjects the overall story arch with something that wasn't necessary in my opinion and since it's about 8-13 years newer than the rest of the games it takes you out of the immersion (it's weird going from 2003 to 2010 and then back to 2004 and 2005). Apart from that I can only recommend this one. It looks good, plays seemlessly and has an interesting story.			",210,55,12,41,26,3,66

												The only Prince of Persia game I have ever played (beside the classic side scrollers in the early '90s). From what I understand there is a trilogy of PoP games and Forgotten Sands is what one should call an interquel, an episode that portrays the events in between those that were explained in two other PoP games.The story follows the prince who tries to help his brother, Malik. Malik was a bad boy and unleashed an army of sand creatures so it is now up to the prince to save the world from Solomon's Army. Story-wise, it offers nothing special, but I liked the struggle between the two brothers - there is a certain tension there that makes you want to proceed and find out how it'll end.When this game came out, Ubisoft was in deep development of the 2nd or 3rd Assassins Creed game. You can only imagine how fluid the climbing in this game, right? Some of these climbing sequences are actually a bit over the top - the prince can later on solidify water to use them as columns or can rebuild the environment if it's in ruins (only for a short period of time, though). Some powers can be used against the enemies, as well, and while fighting you gain experience points and eventually, you level up. This is just a minor RPG component here as PoP is essentially an action-adventure game far from true RPGs.Forgotten Sands has a very high production value that all Ubisoft games can be associated with. It's a relatively long adventure that all gamers should participate in. If you have never heard of the Prince of Persia franchise, you might pick this one up for starters.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Let me make myself clear: Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands is an extremely fun game. It follows the classic formula of the other Prince of Persia games: perform high intensity acrobatics with simplistic combat mechanics and death defying puzzles. But Forgotten Sands executes this formula so well that I want to almost say it is better than Sands of Time. Almost.It’s a high quality game and you really should play through it if you are remotely interested. The mostly challenging campaign lasts about 6-9 hours packed with AMAZING graphics. The story, while mostly original, is intriguing until you get your first super power (from there on out, it’s pretty bland).That said, PoP: FS is very repetitive with the combinations of traps (you will see atleast ONE saw-blade down every hallway) .To read more from this review: http://gamespotting.net/gameblog/review-prince-of-persia-the-forgotten-sands/Verdict: BUY IF ON SALE			",650,177,40,79,76,8,92

												This game is TERRIBLE. I recommend NOT PLAYING IT. The story is boring, the combat is simply mashing one mouse button over and over, and there is very little variety whatsoever in the monsters. I hope this is the final nail in the rotting tomb that is the Prince of Persia franchise. It's just gotten worse ever since the Sands of Time trilogy. This addition is quite frankly, an insult.I forgot to mention more bad things. It's a terrible console-port. Controls are horrible, the graphics don't support V-Sync which caused alot of stuttering, and the camera is god awful. And they ruined the Prince's facial features. They couldn't even get that right.

												Sigh. Where to start with this.Uplay problemsSo, I got the game, downloaded it, Uplay got installed. Couldn't create an account. Downloaded the latest version and launched the game. Right here, all of this is an insult to the players. Pirates will still pirate, all of this is useless.After that, I found out that there are ""awards"" for the game which unlocks additional content for you. Pretty sweet, eh? No. I made progress in game, earned Uplay points, went on the website and unlocked every single award, then I just needed to open Uplay from the game's main menu. But boom, the Uplay browser crashes. Every single time, and I haven't found a proper fix for it.The GameThe game sucks in many ways. ""But it's freaking Prince of Persia dude! It's a must-have for me, right?!"" that's what I thought before buying this game as well. Trust me, you will be disappointed.Ubisoft forgot how their game actually was. In the trilogy, the Prince was the serious type and in the 2008 reboot, he was humorous. This game was meant to be more like the trilogy, yet he's far away from the Prince we know. The plot is pretty light and boring. Some dialogues make you cringe. The music is pretty forgettable, just like the game itself. Nothing like the mysterious OST of Sands of Time and the reboot or the epic Warrior Within. Gameplay is really, really repetitive. You mostly do the same thing you do in every other level. The combat is extremely easy compared to the trilogy, you can almost blow the sand creatures up. All of the boss fights require the same, simple technique except for the last one.  But graphics. Who cares about that? Yeah, it's fairly improved, but it won't cover the actual content up.Overall, I'd say forget about it. Thanks for taking time and reading this.			",41,2,1,2,1,0,7

												Worth playing but nothing in comparison to the originals. literally a pile of poo in comparison. yes you get awesome powers but no real adversaries to use them on. all you really have to do is spam invulnerability and you win(even against final boss).the traps are just tossbacks to the original games same old same old, which isnt bad per say just we've all seen it. the one cool thing i will say is the power of the flow ability whee you can solidify running water. they were really creative with that. the obstacles and timing was precise and fun, mostly. the end level it was just annoying, but challenging nonetheless.all in all this game was not on par with say warrior within or two thrones. which in some ways is fair because its supposed to be an interquel whether before the first or after it i couldnt really tell. so story tech wise it fits. but it just wasnt as fun.to sum up1 lack of combat originality(just hordes of guys against overpowered prince)2 same ol bells and whistles3 water thing was cool and original4 worth the first time playthrough and not much else5/10 you should play it but you prolly wont be happy afterwards			",129,10,3,20,5,1,15

												This game is look like a reboot. If you play the old ones like warrior within or the two thrones, you will notice the differences.The combat system now only allowed the prince to use one sword and kick. Not like the old one that can use two swords or swords with hammer like dual wielding, (duh). Just can attack the enemies, not grabbing and execute it like the old ones.Also this game has upgrade system by killing the enemy, not like the old ones that we should explore to find it.Anyway, this is a pretty solid game and actually kinda funny because sometimes the prince will talk to himself, wondering, that show another side of prince we know as a human.When you get the new sword, a little bit funny thing is the sword will talk if you swing itP.S. : get deluxe version, so you will get free sands of time to nostalgic the glorious old one series of Prince of Persia			",104,25,1,18,5,1,7

												From the Prince of Persia franchise, this is one of the best.The combat part is not ""I-give-up-playing-this"" hard but it's not ""now-with-only-one-hand"" easy. Sometimes there is a lot (and with lot I mean it!) of not too strong enemies, and sometimes there is two or three strong beasts and a bunch of smaller enemies to give them emotional support.The typical PoP parkour is awesome in this game, since you can't just go back in time, but freeze water too, sometimes you need a perfect domain of your hands to do some serious multitasking, specially in the end of the game where there is a stage called ""The Final Climb"", because if you clim that, you can climb everything else.The only not-that-good part of the game is the story, it's a little crude.

												Personally loved it!Comparison with the sands of time trilogy is unavoidable, so let's see:-Story and characters are okay, alas not at the same level as previous games. Let's just say they keep the narrative going for the game, but they are not going to be a shining beacon in the videogame world. Trap comedy never gets old for Ubisoft.-Platforming - absolutely the greatest achievement of the game. It keeps the Sands of Time trilogy basic format, adding here and there some of the features we'd seen in the reboot, plus all-new mechanics which make it so much deeper, and in my opinion better than any of the old ones. It even makes up for the need for uPlay....Ah, yes, of course, there's uPlay... *sigh*-Combat is the hard one. So... love it or hate it, I guess. The fighting system is completely different than before: it's not anymore as acrobatic and varied combo-wise as the old trilogy, but hey, if you're into cleaving through a swarm of enemies with large swipes and the occasional roll-out-of-trouble, this might suit you well. I'm personally pretty ok with the chosen style. If you played the others for the combat though, this may not be the game for you. The powers one can acquire, always in my opinion, all in all are fun and useful, probably more than the sand powers we were used to. Fights get a bit dull, as per usual, at the end with the acquisition of the ever-present ""water-sword-of-the-day"". ",38,8,0,11,0,0,0

												The only Prince of Persia game I have played more than 5-7 times. I know it doesn't seem that way, but that's because I first owned it on XBOX 360 before selling it a long time ago and purchasing it on sale on here about a year later.The Prince of Persia is back, and he's smoother than ever. With a new engine for the series, new visuals, new gameplay, you'll be hooked. I think besides having one of my favorite characters ever lead the way again, the other part that got me hooked was the upgrades and the upgrading system itself. I really like games that have this, even if it's minimal. I don't like being stuck with the same set of skills and powers for the entirety of a video game.The Prince is sent to study alongside his brother, Malik, in order to become a great leader. On arrival, he notices his brother's kingdom under attack again, only this time it's much worse. He is forced to rely on a mythical army to stop the invaders of his kingdom. He releases the army, and not only are the invaders turned to sand, but so too are his soldiers. The only thing that's stopping The Prince & Malik from turning are the amulets they acquire from when Malik released the army. Find out more by playing this amazing game.I really like the smoothness of everything, from the combat to the parkour we all know and love. The Prince is also able to upgrade powers he later acquire and uses, his health, energy, attack power, and more! If you're like me, and you want to stay protected during a fight, so you don't have to scavenge too much for health and energy, then upgrade the power that armors you.I recommend playing this game with a controller. Logitech gamepad's work easily with this.The developers were able to combine SoT & WW into one fantastic game, and I couldn't have kinder words about it. I only wish there was some kind of epilogue DLC, where The Prince runs into something he has to deal with on the journey back home to his father. That would've made the game even more epic.I look forward to more Prince of Persia games.Overall: 10/10PS. This was NOT a tie-in to the film, so don't expect anything to connect the two. Also, this took place BETWEEN Sands of Time and Warrior Within. A lot of people are forgetting that. I hope the next game will offer some kind of combo system, but I don't expect to see more than what I saw in Warrior Within, unless the next game is set after the trilogy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The combat in this game is alright the hardest part of the game is how to get to next location .The game shoves a good amount of enemies at you and it feels right for a Prince of Persia game  the Uplay system in this game is awesome just to get the assassin creed costume for the prince the story is good and I'm half way there and I hope the game has a strong ending .

												Barely any story. Beautiful locations. Sometimes really tough jumping trick combo's. Also expect to die many times. The keyboard commands seem a bit buggy. This can lead you to going the wrong way when jumping and dying. The end game boss was very bad. One of the worst. Overall it's not as good as Sands of Time. Nothing can top that classic. Another bad thing is that it uses Uplay. If you do not mind this and find it on sale it's good enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still not finished, but I've had enough.Pros:+ Very, very funny level design, with the most complex and amazing exploration mechanics in the Prince of Persia franchise;+ Secondary abilities, very useful in combat, adding depth to the choice (and level up).... and that's all, because as Cons:- Combat system is shallow per se, nothing matches the amazing work of Warrior Within and alas, this came after that and is worse (also, enemies variety is ridiculous: how many types are there, like, 4?);- Camera often misleading the player to die even if not at fault - Ubisoft, it's not the first time!;- Bosses also quite shallow, no need to make up strategies: just slash them until they fall;- UPlay. I guess that's the answer to this awful bug: every once in a while, I started the game and waited in front of a neverending black loading screen. Process was stuck, not answering. Unable to start the game. It could even be a decent game, if the experience was not ruined by this bug. Oh, how many times I had to reinstall all the damn thing and it still didn't work. Warrior Within is much better, if you can cope with crappy textures and resolution.			",43,9,1,13,0,0,7

												If you fancy recapturing the original outing with a few new tricks while reinventing the story then forgotten sands will satisfy that itch.My only gripes are i felt detached from the new story as it wasnt for me anyway as quaint as the original, the upgradable powers werent that stunning but still useful, the genie given powers didnt come soon enough not that thats a deal breaker.On the up side i enjoyed marrying the powers and never got tired of falling of stuff through a miscalculated button press which is the way it should be rather than the on the rails feel far to many games put out these days.Its not as good as original lara croft offerings but it did even when the original was first released provide an alternative choice.An easy going pickup and play worth the effort, just not worth the standard asking price so keep in mind when in a sale.

												Forgettable story, linear levels, some technical snafus, boss copy-pasting, combat issues... the list of bits that don't quite cut it is long and it is all over far too quickly, yet Forgotten Sands is a fine addition to the Prince of Persia storyline that plays well and manages to capture some of the platforming magic of Sands of Time.A welcome return to the Prince we all know and love, but I think that now we know him just a little too well.It's really trying to be as brilliant and engaging as Sands of Time - but it does not succeed. Forgotten Sands is just a good, solid action-adventure with lots of fun moments, especially when it comes to acrobatics. But the combat feels blunt and the story is downright uninspired. Still, if you like the series, you should definitely give a try.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

Utterly ForgettableAs someone who loves the Sands of Time Trilogy, I absolutely cannot recommend buying this game. Reasons why are below.Plot: Not much of a plot. The Prince visits his brother (huh, he has a brother?) in Azad and they have boring banter. Something something, the brother unleashes an ancient army, something something, sand monsters, something something, brother is taken over by an evil djinn. Honestly, I took a three month hiatus from this game and when I came back wasn't overly compelled to restart, and I still don't feel like I missed much of the plot, as forgettable as it was. 1/10Characters: The three characters who have any real dialogue in the game are probably some of the most bland and slowest talkers I've ever witnessed. Where's the snappy banter between the Prince and Farah in Sands of Time and Two Thrones? Why do the cutscenes take five minutes to go over details that should be said in five seconds, details that I already know? We don't get to know much of the Prince's brother Malik aside from the fact that he's a warrior leader and thinks he's hot stuff. All we learn of Razia is that she's a good djinn who opposes the evil djinn that killed all the other good djinn. The prince is neither the witty, snarky prince of SoT, the angrier, cynical prince of WW, or the wiser but stilll sarcastic prince of TT. Overall, characters get a 0/10.Graphics: The graphics were alright, but nothing superb. The villain was a generic demonic design, the sand monsters were bland (if high-res) sand monsters. The human characters looked pretty good, but the Prince doesn't look anything like the Prince from the original trilogy. 5/10Combat Mechanics: Slow and clunky. The Prince takes forever to wind up an attack (feels like he's waiting to see if you're charging up your attack before he swings, like in the old 2D games) and will often attack an enemy nowhere near the one you were trying to hit. That's because anytime you enter combat (about every two minutes or so) you have to face at least 10, if not 20 or 30 enemies at once. There's no block button, so you have to rely on dodge-rolls to avoid attacks, and it just doesn't work well with that many enemies all trying to get a piece of you. There aren't any secondary weapons like in WW or TT, the only variation is kicking enemies that have shields to lower their guard, and you can't do any acrobatic attacks aside from jumping onto an enemy and stabbing or kicking them. They tried to make it more cinematic (you occasionally get a special kill cam where he will kick an enemy off a cliff or stab them throught he head) and, unsurprisingly, I felt more like I was watching a movie than playing a game. The only time power you have is rewind, and your other powers, as far as I can tell are useless in a fight. Once you get the sword towards the end of the game, combat becomes more of a mindless button mash than anything else, because enemies die in one hit, or two if they have a shield. Overall, combat gets a 2/10Exploration Mechanics: This is the heart and soul of a Prince of Persia title! Wall runs, jumps, rolls, using powers to get to new heights! This was the only place where the game shined at all, but unfortunately it was only a spark that died in the wind. You start the game with nothing, and once the sand army is unleashed, you get rewind. Alright, cool, you can undo mistakes. Then a bit later you get the Flow power that lets you stop water. That's pretty awesome, too! You use this to run up frozen sheets of water, swing on pillars and columns of it. They even throw in some fun tricky timing bits where you have to pause the flow of the water, jump onto it, jump off of it, unpause, then repause it to catch the next segment. Pretty cool!Then you get a power that lets you home in on enemies after jumping off a ledge. Okay, that's alright I guess, why didn't you just give me this earlier though? And then, in the last hour of gameplay, you get the ability to rebuild crumbled pieces of the architecture one at a time and that's... pretty alright, but they sort of wasted any potential for it because you use it in exactly three areas of the game leading to the final area, then not at all going to the final boss.So what gives? Why give us a new power every quarter of the game instead of introducing them in pretty quick succession? ""Here's time powers. Get used to those. Alright, now here's the flow. Learn to use that with rewind and we'll give you the glide boost. Learn to use glide boost and then we'll give you reconstruction. Now, enjoy the whole game with all these."" That makes a lot more sense than spreading them out over the course of the entire game.The free running and pole swinging and all is a lot slower compared to SoT, WW, and TT. You jump, and the prince takes a second to leap. You hit a pole you have to swing on, and he fumbles his grab, so you have to wait for him to come to a complete stop, then tilt the analog stick in the proper direction for him to swing. That's right, the swing button is no longer mapped to the same button as wall runs.While some of the mechanics are fun, the rest just sort of felt tacked on and not all that useful in the long run, and this whole game just feels really slow compared to previous games. 6/10 and I'm being generous.So, all in all, the game isn't worth getting unless you have to complete your collection. Characters are bland and nowhere near as witty, the story is utterly forgettable, the combat is somehow slow and arbitrarily hard at the same time, and the exploration mechanics are so-so. Overall score: 2.8/10 ",24,7,0,7,1,1,0

												This is another installment of the Sands of Time series of the Prince of Persia. While is not the best in the series, proves to add some improvements to the whole gameplay; a new and somehow fresh story about the Prince of Persia (kinda short if you ask me) has the typical elements of the series, such as: the puzzle rooms, sword fights and some confusing ""extra"" powers. One of the big differences compared to the other games is definitely the combat as this time you fight hordes of enemies which will grant you experience to unlock more skills and/or powers. At first can be fun to fight a lot of enemies, but after a while it is somehow repetitive as there are too many enemy variations.Graphics and the environments are okay and probably way better compared to the other games. Music is okay too. Probably where the game shines is in their puzzles and room exploration as you progress you will get a power which will change the room exploration greatly (you will know while going through the story, but don't want to spoil it for you).Compared to the other games this game has a challenge mode, which is pretty much survive 7 waves of enemies to get more experience and unlock the Prince's skills in story mode. Not really difficult to beat, specially if you have the sword and life upgrades already.I'd recommend this game only if you played the previous games in the series and you are curious about this game, otherwise you will feel the game is really short and doesn't have too much content, for the same reason pick it up when is on sale.

												The Prince of Persia series has a big nostalgia factor for me and I would have to say this one has been the worse one I've played.  This game commits just too many sins for me to ever be able to recommend it.The game does not go to far away from the POP formula.  You have to platform through the room to get to the next room which I typically enjoy and did enjoy in this game.  Albeit they show the path most of the time when you enter a room which really destroyed the puzzle aspect for me.  The puzzles themselves were not difficult.  I would say I probably enjoyed the first half of the game but then it started to just feel uninspired for the last half and I didn't like the final boss fight at all just fight wrong.My biggest problem with the game is it feels like ubisoft rushed it out to time it with the movie and there are multiple bugs and during my 6-7 hour playthrough (I left it on which is why my hours are inflated), it probably crashed 6 times and would become unresponsive if I opened the steam overlay whenever I wanted to chat with a friend.  It saved often enough that I didn't lose much progress but I feel that is far too frequent.  Some of the controls for the second half made it feel the prince was not listening to me.The second biggest problem for me is I was playing on the harder difficulty and the enemies just gave no issues in fact the entire combat felt boring, luckily it did not require much brain power so I could just quickly plow through it.  But the final boss final was pretty much just combat, and he had an attack that knocked me down and for some reason if the prince gets knocked down he just stays on the ground for what feels like forever (Probably 3-8 seconds).   This caused the boss would follow up with another hit killing me.  So if my prince got knocked down he was dead in this battle.  I guess they felt that's how they would make the final boss hard, but it just felt like bad design.I thought the story was servicable but entirely forgetable.  I don't expect good story from the POP series so I was not really disappointed.Overall I would say not the worse game but the worse POP game I've played.  I feel if you just want a adventure/3D platformer and you've played through all the better ones then I would give this some consideration but I feel there are just better games on the market.

												A pretty decent game that took a while to grow on me. The game play is really basic, and the combat is way too easy. The platforming gets a ♥♥♥♥♥ tricky by the end, and the combat really doesn't change at all. I would personally like them to take a risk with the next PoP. Climbing gets really tiring, and part of that problem stems from Asssassins Creed. Get away from repetition, and have some more variety. An alright experience for $2-$3.			",409,188,9,75,28,5,69

												This game is just awesome! First of all, it has a spectacular graphics for a 2010 video game and yet it's pretty optimised, the cutscenes look amazing, all credit goes to the next-gen Anvil engine (the same award-winning engine which was used to develop video games like Assassin's Creed II). Secondly, it has an engaging story which is full of suspense with a tragic ending. The soundtracks of this game are worth praising, they're mainly battle-themed and match the situations well. The gameplay is pretty much like the older Prince of Persia games (except the combos, which are not present in this game), but the level design can often scare the hell out of you! But the game is quite short (~9 hours). Nevertheless, it's the last (and maybe the final) instalment of the Prince of Persia series and it's worth buying (the price is very low now). It's recommended to buy the deluxe edition of this game during a sale (the price drops to $9.99) as you'll get two exclusive skins, one exclusive map, the soundtrack of the game and a free digital copy of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time too!

												If you like the Prince of Persia Story then this game falls right next to the other PoP game that was released only a few years ago (the turban one). The story is pretty weak and the controls aren't that grand. The fact that you have to put a lot of work on controling water and pressing other buttons in sequence doesn't help either. I give it a 5/10 only cause I thought that it had decent graphics and interesting characters. Lastly, there is no blocking, everything is done as a role. So my fingers were hurting at the end. So if you were to buy this game, don't say I didn't warn you.			",111,61,1,5,2,2,4

												Buggy as all hell.I'm a big fan of POP, Mirror's Edge, Portal, and really any game that requires quick-thinking acrobatic feats to finish it. They're a gem. I also very much enjoyed The Sands of Time, and looked forward to the sequel. However, when I can't rotate on a pillar without finding myself falling in space surrounded by an infinite skyline, some of the puzzles are impossible. These bugs make the game unplayable.When I see that Ubisoft has finally fixed these bugs, on a very aged game, I'll be happy to take this review down. The graphics are breathtaking and detailed, and the plot line (as of yet) is quite good. However, given my inability to finish the game on this platform, I can't recommend it. These bugs are the result of sloppy programming, and should have been fixed ages ago.			",173,33,5,24,11,0,10

												Alright. The Prince is back.Prince of Persia. I remember playing these games on my phone way back and seeing it in crisp 3d is something else.I'll list down the things that make this game fun to play as well as the things that make this game annoying to play.Pros of the game:-Its a Prince of Persia game.-Simple combat system!-Powers!-Swords!-The Prince's Facial Hair!-Platforming with traps!-Hilarous Ragdolling!-Swordplay!-Kill Cam! (well..yeah, sort of kill cam)-Art style and art direction!-Voice acting!-Graphics!-Ambient sounds!-Environment Puzzles!-Skills and or powers and such!-Ezio Auditore Da Firenze Skin!-Getting stuck in the traps!-Rewind ability!-The Prince's Facial hair!-Persian prince that in no way sounds persian!-Some Alternate Outfits!-An Arena Mode!-It has a story!-SAND!Cons:-Controls get stuck and most times it is awkward as hell.-No block mechanism.-No targeting mechanism.-Platforming on some parts are laughably easy and some are frustratingly hard (Mostly cause of the awkward controls)-Animations could have been smoother.-Predictable Enemy Boss/Mini-bosses-Not much diversity when it comes to enemies.-Some of the powers are useless and some are OP-Prince does not get up fast enough when ragdolled.-Difficult camera angles + the awkward controls make for artificial difficulty.-Short story on the main campaign.-Ending was lackluster.-Somehow it feels like a blatant sequel-bait game.-Story itself was lacking depth.-Cheap♥♥♥♥♥FINAL BOSS.-The arena extends play time but i'd prefer if there were missions or a separate campaign with Malik instead (with his half of the amulet at least..oops. spoiler)-The water power could be utilized for other things other than making climbable objects but it wasn't utilized that way.-You'll only ever need the Whirlwind and Ice Blast power. The other two are obsolete and are just there as stat fodder.-You don't get to wear Malik's mask if you have the Malik skin.I give it a 6.5/10Cause its a good game which could have been great if there were more to it than just this.Pick it up on a sale cause you won't regret it if you get for less.Cheers			",426,66,10,61,38,5,34

												As far as PoP games go, this one's a solid experience. It may be a bit off-beat from the others with the ""elemental powers"" and stuff, but it's still PoP at it's heart.Personally though, I'd think twice before spending extra for the deluxe edition.			",185,45,1,25,8,4,27

												Finished in 7 hours and 30min aprox, was fun the story,also i saw some comments that you cant change language of interface well i found a solution open the game directory ""Steam\SteamApps\common\Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands\"" and double click on ""GameSettings.exe"" now it should appear a new window and has 3 tabs you must click on ""Language"" tab and then you select the desired language you wish your game to have, click on ""OK"" button and fixed, enjoy!

												This Prince of Persia game, being the only of its kind for this series, thus far, has a simple battle system which stays true to the roots of the PoP fighting engine. The ability unlock system gave me optional ways to destroy my enemies as well as make the game gear more towards my advantage. The environment was gorgeous and the puzzles were complex enough for even the truest of PoP fans that it would be a decent head-scratcher. The story did move me a bit, as it was a ""fight for your kingdom"" plot, but put me to actually beomce motivated about finishing this game, which is why I believe Ubisoft did an amazing job with this wonderful game.

												Hooray! I'm caught up on Prince of Persia games! Everything great about this game comes from just how effing fun the platforming sequences are. The story's barely worth noticing, but is nice for kids. (Unfortunately, story is what I like to look at in games these days. Sadface.) But gosh, is that platforming ever delicious! Improved over the original trilogy, on par with the grows-on-you restart from 2008, minus the repetitiveness (which means this game is short!).Combat's improving, but is still a chore in the way of the series' true calling (duh: platforming!), but I honestly can't picture what this series could replace it with. (Would it work with ONLY the platforming? I don't think I can say yes.)			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												A great game that follows the styles of combat, obstacles and most things from the original trilogy of Prince Of Persia (The Sands of Time, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones).Been a fan of this series for a huge long time, I used to think the game didn't have that kind of charm and fun in adventure and platforming like the original trilogy, after the spin-off game Prince Of Persia was released back in 2008. (which in my opinion was a good game that has nice story with good characters, though it was a strange spin-off) but I'm really glad I was so wrongObstacles and platforming: - One of the two special charms of the whole series, hard to dispute this game can pull off without these beautifully made mechanism of traps, and the design of the way to guide the player through them. - Some of the obstacles are back from the Original Trilogy (the Spikes, the straight-up high walls, the swinging axes, the running saw wheel..) and some even from the 2008 spin-off game (sliding slope..)- Newer, bigger and much harder obstacles in the game (one of which is the multiple layers of water wall, which in my opinion is the hardest of all obstacles I have ever seen in the whole series, and also the swinging huge thorn tree log)- The platforming has been upgraded to a higher new level, this means whoever still got the mind back when playing the original trilogy, now can rest assured that their style of platforming will be upgraded to a higher new level. Since it requires 1 or 2 more steps to pass the ostacles.- The Saving Checkpoints were arranged nicely , typical of the whole series itselfCombat:- No longer a young prince, this guy now can make a lot of nicer attacks, combos and smoother acrobatic movements. However, The Forgotten Sands does not have the old mechanism of using 2 swords + combos (which were in the original Trilogy) , or stealth kill (The Two Thrones)- One thing has returned from The Sands of Time: You got a fight with a huge platoon of enemies by yourself! But that doesn't mean you can't take them all out.- In fact, the enemies in this game are pretty not that hard to face, which doesn't seem to be much of a concentration in this game, since the design, scenery, platforming element and story of the game are the main focus. - The new system of using 4 natural elements in this game are pretty nice to help you with all the combat, though after a while, you'll recognize that they are only useful in facing some types of enemies.- A whole new system of upgrading (which was only from the spin-off game, not the original trilogy) will help you get so much better. And I agree with this decision of Ubisoft Montreal. No more running around trying to find the upgrades and water sink to recover the health (Warrior Within), you can get Health, Energy and XP from the enemies and vases (which is an old point of the original trilogy)Design and graphic:- The design of the obstacles, the platforming in The Forgotten Sands are smooth- The color when using the elements are really nice, especially when you freeze the time flow of the water, each drop of the water wall is so clear to see and beautifully made.- However,... once again, it seems the enemies are not really the main focus of the game, so they are quite not that well designed, but it doesn't matter, what matters is what they can do to you though.I believe most people who used to play the original trilogy should check this game out and get immersed in the World of the Prince of Persia once more. Even if you haven't played the Trilogy, this game still won't make you feel disappoint at all. In fact, it may even bring you back to play the original trilogy itself!Rating: 9/10 by me. -0.5 because the Djin temple quite lacked the design and change in the 2 pictures (you'll see, they should have recorded the moments of the game) , -0.5 because the challenge mode lacks too much effort invested by Ubisoft.Have fun! P.S: Ezio is also spotted in the game, though in different shape. But who knows, maybe someday AC and POP can be brought together. - Of course, since it was released back in 2010, try to buy the game when it's on sale.			",129,17,2,20,6,0,9

												I was a big fan of Sands of Time when it came out but never really bothered with the series except for trying out the reboot ""Prince of Persia"". This is the first one I have bought since SoT and I'm definitely glad I did. I'll admit I was fairly sceptical about buying this game and it would never have come to my attention if it wasn't on offer but I own it now and I don't regret it. The game has an alright story, its nothing special but the characters never acted unreasonable or stupid which I had expected.The graphics aren't too bad considering it came out in 2010, definitely nothing special although the facial animations were pretty good, at least for the Prince anyway. The voice acting was also pretty decent, the characters were convincing except for the occasional interruption of a puzzle by the Prince inner monologuing about how to solve it.The parkour was up to the usual PoP level and with a few very welcome additions. The abilities to freeze water and teleport makes for some really interesting gameplay and adds a time element to the levels. However even though I could never place my finger on why, the sense of scale and feeling of progress wasn't as strong as in SoT. I regularly lost track of why I was going the way I was and the heights weren't brought to my attention very much. Luckily this didn't really take much away from gameplay.The combat conjured some very mixed feelings. It started out being very boring, just chopping at enemies and moving on. I was really dissapointed to see my favourite elements removed since SoT. No longer did I feel like I was taking down bulky enemies through agility and manuevering, now I was the bulky one and I could chop them down in a few swings. But as the game went on and I experimented more and more I found it was decently varied and not as bad as I first thought. However late into the game you are given a powered-up sword and for the first five minutes I got a kick out of killing enemies in one hit. But then I realised any and all strategy it once had was gone. The game started out as expected but entertained me throughout until the final boss, a clunky giant with lumbering swings and poor reactions, pretty standard and very boring but forgivable.Overall I really liked this game, if you have never played Prince of Persia don't go for this one, start with sands of time. If you are a fan then buy this one, it's actually pretty good.			",174,27,6,10,7,3,14

I understand that it is a movie tie in, but the cinematic opening wasnt needed, it makes the graphics of the game look worse, which i wouldnt have noticed had there been better continuity. The joy of Prince of persia games is the speed and fluidity of the charicter's animations, which this game didnt have. you dont get a feeling of momentum, rather waiting as he takes far too long to get to the next section			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is pretty terrible.  The double DRM between Steam and Uplay causes several issues, including needing at least 3 forced terminations after clearing various popups from the services telling them to never show again after which all input is dead so you have to alt+f4 the thing.  Follow up with NO graphics settings.  None.  At all.  Move on to a bad tearing issue in the video, wonky camera stuff where you go from having pan controls to not and back again, and it goes from there.  Plays poorly, feels terrible, suffers from a lot, and that was all in the first few minutes.  I don't expect it gets any better.  I could be wrong, but given the gameplay style I'm pretty sure it's like many others of this vintage with the camera annoyances just killing it.			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

												Im a big fan of the first 3 Prince of Persia games and i have to say this one is an insult.Right now u start with a new Prince who is actually saying he is THE prince but really, he isnt, because of the following steps:-He has a new voice, not something hard to hear, its just a complett other voice-over and it sounds crappy.-The 3d-Model looks complete messy, rly it just sucks-He acts again like he did at the start of part 1 but a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥did go down in Part 1 and he isnt the same as he was before all of this All inall this new - old - young prince just seems pretty weird and i couldn`t get a attraction on him or even interest To show what i mean is proven fast, you cant block. No thats no joke you simply cant block. All you do is pressing ctrl if someone is attacking you and between pressing ctrl u do some left clicks, short for a normal attack and long for a strong one and you can combo it up to 5 times in diffrent ways means long-long-short-long-shoert, long-long-long-short-short etc. If you take it this way there are 120 combo-pssibilities! And there is a kick if someone has a shield but forget about this nonsense.No longer 2 swords and diffrent ways to combine left and right handed-hits to freaky  over-the-top moves all you are able to do is left-clicking. Even the wall-slice isnt possible any more. I got bored after the 3th fight.And thats only the fighting system...The Puzzles i met so far (i haven`t played a long time right now and i cant imagine its getting more..) are just boring and simple as hell, maybe some of you still remember the activation of the defense system in Part 1? this one was harder then all of the puzzles right now together,but i have to admit the maybe get better later on.The Sand-Monsters look... i would use some words i dont want to write down right here but they just aint cool. Its like a zombie out of an 60`s zombie movie, its like the complete cliche and the story feels like: Blablabla hit these zombies now! The story wasn`t the strongest part in the other games neither, but this one beats them all. His brother gets introduced as the new sidekick, but to compare him with farah or even.Kaileena is absurd.I played the spin-off Prince of Persia (2008) which was pretty funny for me as long as uyou dont expect too much and so i  looked forward to play this game, but im completely dissapointed and all thats left to me is telling everyone who loved the old Games and   was close to Tears when the Prince and Farah stand on the top of the Babylon palast and he starts to tell her the fairytale of the first part again, dont buy this one and left him as your memories as he are and as he deserves to be.

												I finished this in a weekend.  It takes tomb raider and adds better more fluid combat.  The moves and skills are pretty neat, bosses are also cool, grafx top notch (DX10) I played with an nVidia 480GTX with fluid frame rates.  There are a few challenge modes that focus on combat, but nothing substantial.  Get this if its on sale for less than $10 and play it completely through in 1 or 2 sittings for some serious fun.Oh, and play it with an XBOX controller... way easier than the keyboard/mouse.

												I had a more thorough review thought out, but I'll be damned if I put more thought into the review than I put into the game itself. There are worse ways to spend your money on Steam, but there are better ways. If you can get a really good sale for a pack that includes Sands of Time, or you're desperate for a Prince of Persia fix and are willing to settle, then get it. Otherwise, Forgotten Sands is competent, but forgettable.My first PoP game was Sands of Time (often considered the defining title), but that was only a couple years ago. No nostalgia blindness here. Sands of Time not only holds up after 13 years, but was a superior experience to this one. Forgotten Sands has just the right amount of minor bugs to ruin any sense of immersion without driving you from the game completely. The combat is boring, repetitive, and sometimes blatantly padded. The platforming is adequate, though far from the best in the franchise. The dialogue is competently written, but ""get the macguffin"" hardly qualifies as a plot and a character saying ""oh golly I feel less anxious about _____ now"" hardly qualifies as character development.

												I'm a hardcore Prince fan, what can I say. Purple Rain is my favorite song. ...wait. Not that Prince.Forgotten Sands is pretty decent so far. I have no idea how far I am through it, but I can't be more than about 25% done (it takes me a long time to play a game, OK?). It's not the best in the franchise, and it's certainly not my favorite. But if you like Prince of Persia, eh...why not? It's super cheap on Steam right now. The music is awesome, the graphics aren't mind-blowing but they're pretty good, and the story is enganging enough that it keeps me wanting to play it.The Ubisoft start-up menu is annoying as hell. (You start the game, which starts Steam, and then it starts Ubisoft's community thing on top of that, and THEN you start the effing game, so be sure to build in an extra 10 minutes in when you want to play to get beyond all that crap! Jesus, Ubisoft!.) Also, you really, really (really, really, really) need a joystick or game pad to play and perform combos effectively unless you are some kind of a savant with WASD. I am not (I recommend the Logitech Gamepad F310 for PS3 users. If you prefer Xbox, you're on your own.).Other than that, it's the same snarky Prince we all know and love.

												Disclaimer: Did not finish the game. Played a cracked version to ~60% because Ubi servers were down when I bought (or licensed?) it some years ago. Tried this legit version only to find it no better today.+ A PoP game that captures some of the serie's essence+ Controls are not horribly set up (controller), but the combat feels like swinging a mace and not a sword+ I got 2500+ fps in the Main menu, steady 60 in game with a 980ti. The Ubisoft opening logo animation juttered between 15-25fps    - Alt tabbing, opening the Steam overlay or launching the game with my 360pad on (wireless) leads to the game not responding to anything except Alt F4. Turning the pad on after the 'Press any key to start' screen works.- Eye wounding flashing graphical glitches, almost like z-fighting but in the effect shaders, I think- Graphics settings only list Brightness (AA & Vsync can be turned on from a setup file in the game folder)			",136,22,6,9,15,0,16

												I wanted to like Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. I love the (admittedly westernized) genre of strong princes and fair princesses set against a backdrop of rocky mountains, roiling sand and Moorish castles. I was hoping to get some of that with some good graphics, music, story, and some climbing thrown in. Well, forget the story. There is one, but not so you'd notice. The game is a series of climbing puzzles / challenges, with some hack 'n slash combat every so often. The combat is fairly easy, and the puzzles, with two exceptions, are not that hard to solve. Actually playing the puzzles through, though, is intensely frustrating (I play exclusively with a keyboard + mouse). Lag is extraordinarily high. The game is sometimes not sensitive enough to input, and at other times too sensitive. Some skills and abilities are on a timer (freeze water for X number of seconds), so what seems a minor annoyance at the beginning of the game magnifies into greater and greater significance later on (expect The Aqueducts level to really give you trouble). I can put up with all that, though. The killer blow for me is the same thing I hated in Ubisoft's sister platformer, Assassin's Creed. Get into a place with one path forward, and the camera view locks up: you can't turn and look to see where you need to go without just blindly following the path indicated by the camera lock-up. I absolutely HATE this; I hated it in Assassin's Creed, and I hate it here. In this case, without the ability to look around, you'll die multiple times until you realize, oh, I need to go in X direction, so I need to do the upwards back-and-forth-between-walls climb three times to reach my objective ledge. Incredibly frustrating, and for me a game-breaker. As  I said, the story is near non-existent. An invading army is attacking the castle, so the Prince's brother Malik unleashes King Solomon's army - of sand soldiers. The Prince has to figure out a way to corral the army - and stop his brother, who seems to be accumulating the power of the sand-soldiers with each one he kills. Whatever. I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. They're just there as an excuse for some platforming. The graphics are good, even by 2010 standards - fire looks very realistic - but the water is strangely low-res. And there is a lot of water in this game. The music is suitably evocative, but after capturing the initial mood, is repetitive and unexciting (thought the orchestration uses a number of different instruments and it sounds well-played).Incredibly disappointed in The Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. Not because it is bad per se, but because frustrating gameplay mechanics mean I'll be moving on to something else.			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												While it's a decent addition into the Prince of Persia series, that's all it is, decent. For the PoP fans out there, that'll be enough for now to sate their appetite for a competent platformer. However, I can't recommend this game to any other type of audience. The story seems rushed, and while sure, story isn't everything in a platformer, that, combined with lackluster combat and poor camera control makes this feel scraped together. If you are looking for good platforming, it works well in that area, if you are looking for more than that, and can deal with outdated graphics, go for the Sands of Time trilogy instead.

												It's last big PoP game made by Ubisoft. It's not bad, but not as good as Sands of Time trilogy. I bought it on sale few years ago and finally I'm trying to finish it. Plot is rather bad, level design is average. It's probably better than PoP with Elika, but nothing more than a movie tie in.One thing about this game is that each platform has it's own game. PC version is the same the X360 and PS3 got. Wii got completely different game. Way better, with new powers, better plot, better controls with good enough graphics.If you played Sands of Time Trilogy, buy this game. If you haven't get those three great games instead.

It crashes on login and renders it impossible to play the game.Ok to be honest NEARLY impossilbe to play it. Look at this either as warning if you haven't bought this game already or otherwise as help:Originally posted by nakyrules:- I uninstalled Uplay entirely. ***It leaves files behind! Go to your \program files (x86)\ folder and delete the Ubisoft folder there completely. This was necessary for me to do***- I restarted my computer (had to do this too, no restart after removal/installation did nothing for me before)- I re-installed Uplay using the installer found on Uplay's website.- After installation, I restarted again.- I launched the game through Steam and after about a minute, Uplay finally came up without crashing and updated itself.- Exit Uplay.- Re-launch the game through Steam again, and now you can input your key to activate it.

The 2008 iteration of this franchise was by all accounts a much more fulfilling experience(a likeable protagonist, colorful, far better voice acting/cutscenes).			",116,7,2,5,1,0,1

												Persian platforming at its best. Lots of fun and complex platforming mixed with simple and fun largescale sword combat. This game is a blast and fun for anybody who's a fan of Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, Assassins Creed, or pretty much any story based platforming games. My only complaint would be that it's a bit short. The prince's dialogue can also be somewhat frustrating to listen to. But freezing water and running off of walls make this game so worth it. I'd recommend getting it if it gets to $10 or cheaper.			",213,12,5,6,9,1,2

												One of the better platforming action games I've ever played. I've beaten this a long time ago on console so I know it is good from start to finish. The graphics are very good (for its time) and the entire game looks outstanding. The sound is great and the controls are smooth and solid and very intuitive. The gameplay is smooth and the game engine runs flawlessly. Combat is a lot of fun, especially once you learn new skills. The levels are expertly designed and there are some pretty challenging platforming stages. The game is so much fun to play because it just looks so awesome. I really love the artwork. Overall this is well worth it when you can catch it on sale, and is even a good buy at its normal price. The only downside I've found so far is that the game exe crashes when you exit, which doesn't even matter as long as it is on exit. Doesn't make sense but oh well it doesn't affect anything. Also when you are playing if you bring up the steam overlay then go back to the game, no keyboard keys work anymore for some odd reason, but it can be quickly fixed by alt+tabbing out then back in so it's not much of a big deal. It is also a big time button masher when it's combat time. So to avoid killing your hand from left clicking insanely, use a controller to play. Great game, 8/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												В глаза сразу бросается наконец современная графика, которой не было со времён четвёртой части. Хорошая анимация, сильный графический ""движок"", внимание к мелочам, например монетки вылетающие из под ног или то как принц следит за искорками из порталов. Боевая система упрощена сверх меры, оно бы было не так плохо, если при этом и акробатика не пострадала. Очень слабая планировка уровней, остановка воды многообещающая идея, так и рисующая прогулку по солёным застывшим волнам с зависшими в воздухе каплями, в исполнении обернувшаяся пресными трубами. Вода вытекает из труб и исчезает в воздухе, при остановке даже анимация продолжает играть, а все брызги исчезают и заменяются на стандартную модель. Так же остановка воды не влияется на не заскриптованную воду, например на лужи. Разработчики даже не добавили прогулок по коронам бьющих из под земли фонтанов. Да и всё использование почти не отличается от ""нажми кнопку получи упор для прохождения"", мало того убрали ""розетки"" и настенные трамплины, убрали рычаги, возможность вернуться назад и многое другое. Зато добавили прыжки по врагам в сеть акробатики. Мало того что оно совсем не реалистично, так ещё видимо не учли что видя врага начинаешь искать способ его убить и вернуться в режим акробатики, поэтому часто в упор не видишь способа продвинуться дальше. Говорящим мечом конечно никого не удивишь, но меч бубнящий заклинания при каждом взмахе - интересная идея.Больше всего это похоже на то что Darksiders смешали с Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions и декорациями из четвёртой-шестой частей.

												I recommend this game if you are a fan of the Prince of Persia series on the ps2 like Sands of time and such! This is basically an interquel between PoP: SoT and PoP:WW the gameplay is smooth as butter I mean it literally runs perfectly and the new gameplay mechanics keep it fresh such as controlling water with time in puzzles and such while still retaining that old school PoP feeling. You also get upgrades for your attacks and magic as well as being able to play as Ezio after you beat it as the prince! :D It also supports the xbox 360 controller if you have that.  Highly recommend this game especially if it's on sale! :)			",160,20,5,16,7,2,21

The ""Sands Of Time"" Trilogy set the world on fire with it's unique game play and puzzles, it really made a milestone and kept it's throne ""The Forgotten Sands"" is part of the ""Sands Of Time"" Trilogy taking place between ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" and ""Prince of Persia: Warrior Within""If you are into puzzles that make you think, and death defying jumps that make you doubt gravity exists, then any Prince Of Persia game is for you, Also if turning back time makes you happy... then also think about getting it.

												A good sequel to the first game. Overall the game is very reminiscent of the first game from the platforming, some of the combat and the Prince's personality/musings. Compared to the original a bit of the platforming and much of the combat has been streamlined/tweaked in terms of jumping from poles or not having to ""finish off"" every enemy. The upgrades were rather simple/straightforward though felt like it could be expanded on. A big complaint were technical issues with the game involving a certain black screen... so if you happen to encounter that hopefully this will help http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=20207732&postcount=5 ",380,90,9,67,26,3,51

												Forgotten Sands is a solid game with a decent story. The problem is, fitting it between two parts of an existing trilogy means that by necessity, the game can't tell a story that both ties into the plot of the trilogy and is important to the trilogy's plot. As a result, Forgotten Sands is a standalone adventure which has absolutely no relevance to the overarching plot. It's also very similar mechanically and structurally to Sands of Time, but with a few new elements and small tweaks, and without the awesome framing device of the Prince telling his story (that's referenced at the beginning but is quickly abandoned). If you're a fan of the series it's worth playing, but it's not a good place to start your Prince of Persia adventures - Sands of Time is still my favourite and the best jumping-on point.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/08/prince-of-persia-forgotten-sands.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Will not be recommending this game until Uplay stops ruining my relationship with prince of persia. First I could not log into Uplay because Uplay was down. I had recently downloaded prince of persia. So it said i couldn't play offline without logging in first. I finally got to log in after about 15 minutes. I then started my game, and immediately my game froze. I had to restart Uplay re-log into Uplay and restart my game. I got into my game and pressed the menu button and my game froze.I had to restart Uplay log back in and start up my game again. This went on for about 30 minutes. I don't know whats going on in this game and probably never will thanks Uplay, Ten dollars of my money well wasted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands™ is a prequel to Warrior Within and a sequel to Sands of Time. It's intended as a lost story from the prince happening right after he comes back to his brother's kingdom.However, the story is plain dumb. It mixes another kind of sands (really? always sands?) and this time the Prince has the power of the Ifrits (some kind of Arabic geniuses-gods-entities) on his side. He can basically do the same he always did: go back and forth in time, freeze it, aerobic combat... all is almost the same.The combat system is refined though, nothing like the previous games. It has more combos. And the upgrade system uses orbs, like God of War. So basically it's a ripoff of itself and other games.Finally, it uses UPlay. That's definitely a downside. Having another DRM client over Steam, needing to log into it and all that, is stupid beyond measure.Anyway, if you're a true fan, you should get it. It's not boring, but it's not magnificent as the previous installments were. Kind of a letdown, to be honest.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

												This game was hugely disappointing. It's the camera angles. In a game where you live or die by your ability to control the prince, the game dies, because even when you can control him it's painful to do so, and he ends up doing things which look stupid, like jumping at a forty five degree angle instead of directly toward a horizontal pole when missing means death, so it just feels stupid. The rest of the ingredients are all there and if there wasn't the one fundamental flaw which makes all the great features moot it would be one of the best (if not the best) of a good series, but instead it is the worst by a fair margin. If they'd just stuck the camera behind you (or given you that option) with commensurate controls, so you could run toward a pole and jump to the pole rather than having to guess whether you should be jumping ""West"" or ""Northwest""...Seriously this is a three dimensional game, so why should I only be able to move in precisely 8 directions, and those dictated by and gimped by the camera position? So close to a great game and yet so far. ",20,13,0,6,4,0,4

												Prince of Persia is now back to Sands of Time universe. The Forgotten Sands is interquel happened between Sands of Time and Warrior Within. The Prince visited his brother's kingdom and end up in a war with evil mythical army created by Djinn. Though no Sands of Time involved, the Prince, besides his acrobatics, still got many powers, granted by benevolent Djinn, including time rewind, water freezing and couple of interesting powers. They are spectacular to see and add complexity and fun to traveling. Level design is also cleverly creative, utilizing all Prince's powers. Combat is fluid and dynamic though sometime repetitive. There is no life upgrade but improving with experience and upgrade points which well integrated into the game increasing depth and customization. Story is interesting and Prince's personality is cool though the ending doesn't make an impact. There are also some issues with connection and Uplay. The Forgotten Sands is true to the series and shouldn't be forgotten.			",440,123,1,46,29,1,62

												All-around solid game despite the difficulty being too easy and fights are a major drawback when compared to even Sands of Time. I would have welcomed a hard or even higher difficulty. Back in early 2000's this was a trilogy that made you buy it as soon as it came out. Now there are hundreds of IP's around, you can almost miss this one (thanks to Ubisoft's overpriced policies).Overall, one of the best deals in Steam this season. Recommended.			",164,23,7,12,4,0,19

												Throw back to old school Prince of Persia!! Not as well rounded as Sands of Time, gameplay not as engaging as Warrior Within, scale is not as epic as Two Thrones and there is no Elika/Farah/Monica Belluci (:P) but on the up side, it gives full control over movement (unlike PoP 2008 where you just intiate a movement and it automatically plays out). Forgotten Sands does not hold back on the acrobatics, and the amount of ""are you sure that can be done"" moments towards the end are AWESOME! :) The addition of water freezing and recalling memory powers add to the complexity of the acrobatics in an good way; you always get satisfaction when pulling off that next imposible stunt! However, the combat is dumbed down, so is the story.

												A very entertaining game that keeps A heartbeat to it. The flow of the game is great and put together really well. The graphics in the cutscenes are great to look at and have alot of detail for the eyes to see. The movement and gameplay in the game wasn't as smooth as previous Prince of Persia games but it was still fun. The camera was the biggest thing that bugged me with this game on how you couldn't always control it, but it was nice that it showed you which way to go. The fighting wasn't too exciting to do since it was just a button smasher type of game. The overall story was intriguing and alot of fun to follow. The overall game doesn't take long to beat. I have enjoyed this game, and recommend it to anything that is into the series. I loved playing it and I know you will too if you have the right controller like a Xbox 360 controller. I wouldn't suggest playing this on keyboard and mouse. It was a great game and I really enjoyed it! Get It and Don't Regret It!			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,476

												First Thoughts....Nice detail.  Story line is good, even with the cut scenes every minute its fast paced.  Probably better with a controller as the controls can be awkward on a keyboard (e.g. 'w' is not always forward, which is rather annoying).Second Thoughts...Having played Assassin's Creed, other than the story, they are very similar.  Controls, graphics, jumping around and doing acrobatics everywhere.  Still a nice game if you haven't played any of the PoP or AC titles before.			",194,47,0,31,21,3,38

												Worst in series by far, but still playablegame is repetitive, enemies repetitive, the sceneries repetititive, and even the traps and and the puzzles are very repetitive. Its a pretty straigh forward game, so you actually dont even need to think or even stop for a second,, because pressing forward and combo in the keys is enough The game is short you will finish it in like 7/8 hours or less.The combat system was way better  in the previous versions of PoP, More combos, more artistic jumps and was overall more pleasant to fight the enemiesThe water freezing was a good idea to add to the game and it works, but soon becomes also very very repetitiveThe game overall was a bit boring, and i saw myself just playing it to complete the game, it was not being fun, because i was doing the same things all over again, again again and again , it seemed this wayThe saving system was also better in previous versions like for example the fountain where you would save your position.. in forgotten sands, the game saves your position every 1 minute of path you make, so its not important not to die, because you willr respawn in the same placeI recommend it just for those who like prince of persiaone last update... the uplay thing.. its just terrible that we need to go trough that. I mean uplay is just broken... i had plenty of crashes and problems playing the game because of this			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Normally I would probably give this game somewhere in between just a YES and NO, but since I can only choose between the two I will have to stick with a NO (details below).+ Platforming is really fun: The Prince can do a lot of different moves and (for the most part) is easy to control, making   leaping and running around a lot of fun. Plus the difficulty for the obstacles was pretty good.+ It looks pretty (nothing really to add here)- Really meh story: Dumb brother releases evil thing, brother gets possessed, go kill brother. There, now you can save some time and not watch the boring cutscenes.- Comabt: It happens way too frequently and it almost always boils down to ""Mash X until everything is dead"". Sometimes there are some super big guys that charge you, but even then you just need to dodge and then mash X. There are some power-ups you can get once you get enough XP from enemies, but honestly I just found mashing X was way easier and quicker then using the powers.- Screen tearing: There's no VSync option so you're going to have to live with it! It mostly happens during cutscenes but it's still really annoying. (especially one paticular cutscene had nearly the entire screen screen tearing yuck)- GLITCHES: Definitely the most annoying thing about this game! A few times I've had poles disapear while I was on them and other poles wouldn't let me grab onto them for some reason, but those didn't happen that often. The most annoying and frequent glitch, however, was sometimes if you got hit by a big baddy or a trap you would fall down and be unable to get back up for a few seconds. Luckily you usually didn't take damage while you were like this, but it happened way too frequently for me to just me a minor nuisance.- Crashes: I had the game crash 4 times while I played, 3 of those was in one paticular area that I did eventually get past (there were a lot of enemies that wouldn't give XP which I tried to skip, but once I killed most of them I got past it) and once when the credits were nearly finished. Maybe I was just unlucky and they might not happen to you, but I thought I should still point this out.- Uplay: You better have a stable connection to play this! (plus any other negatives associated w/ Uplay) I didn't have any Uplay problems while playing but I thought I should point it out anyway.So while there are a lot of negatives, I did enjoy the platforming enough where I normally would say ""Maybe?"". So if you think you can get though the comabt and annoying glitches, then maybe get it when it's on sale? Otherwise, I wouldn't blame you for skipping this.			",153,62,0,41,31,1,15

TL;DRThis is basically Prince of Persia: SoT, climbing puzzles and all, with a few God of War elements slipped in. It starts slow at first and man does it feel its age, but gets pretty good halfway through.How long is it? Main game is about 6 hours, NG+ and bonuses add a few more.Did you like it? Yeah, but it took a while for me to warm up to.How much should I spend on it? Around $5. Wait for a sale, or get Sands of Time.=== Overview ===Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands tries to bring back a lot of what made the Sands of Time game successful - the frantic, skill-based jumps and puzzles, the snarky main character, and the simpler combat. Problem is, where the original game shined (in story and in characters), this game fell flat on its face. The environments are so bland and same-y, the story is completely flat, and the moments where the prince's snide nature comes out are just too few and far between. Even the combat starts to feel a bit wonky and boring. Where the game really shines is in the puzzles. Swiftly leaping between traps, timing your jumps just right, was a lot of fun, especially when you get really neat special powers like the ability to stop water mid-air for some fascinating puzzles.I'll be honest though, it took me a couple times of dropping the game and coming back to it to finish it, but it got fun half-way through.=== The good ===+ Great parkour-styled puzzles+ They brought back the original Sands of Time voice actor!+ They did come up with a couple of neat settings for you solve your way through.+ Certain special powers, like the ability to stop water mid-air, was really fun. === The bad === - Flat, uninteresting characters.- Bland, one-note story.- Boring music.- The combat is snore-tastic and grindy.- Very little replay value.- The environments hardly make any sense at certain points.Bottom Line If you're bored and want a Prince of Persia game to turn your brain off and play, this'll do it for you. Just be prepared to turn your brain back on half way through the game once the devs started trying.			",455,127,7,69,23,6,41

												From day 1, All the way back to its NES roots Prince of Persia has amazed people all over the world, the first of it's kind and the best too. The ""Sands Of Time"" Trilogy set the world on fire with it's unique game play and puzzles, it really made a milestone and kept it's throne ""The Forgotten Sands"" is part of the ""Sands Of Time"" Trilogy taking place between ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" and ""Prince of Persia: Warrior Within""If you are into puzzles that make you think, and death defying jumps that make you doubt gravity exists, then any Prince Of Persia game is for you, Also if turning back time makes you happy... then also think about getting it.

												Great addition to the Prince of Persia Franchise. One of the most visually stunning and fun to play, final stages in any game!A bit on the short side, but i like my games short...Game started off a bit easy, made me wonder if this was a watered down version of a PoP game, but as you get the powers things start getting very interesting. Best visuals of the franchise so far (a tie with PoP 2008 to be honest).I would encourage PoP fans to pick this one up on sale any time!			",755,175,53,85,77,7,128

												All-around solid game despite the difficulty being too easy and fights are a major drawback when compared to even Sands of Time. I would have welcomed a hard or even higher difficulty. Back in early 2000's this was a trilogy that made you buy it as soon as it came out. Now there are hundreds of IP's around, you can almost miss this one (thanks to Ubisoft's overpriced policies).Overall, one of the best deals in Steam this season. Recommended.			",164,23,7,12,4,0,19

												 This game is like that family member you love but sometimes wonder if they are really related to you.  In many aspects it really does feel like a refreshed portion of the trilogy while bringing in fresh new elements, other portions however veer off from what I expected from the game going in. Playing the game when it came out honestly I hated it for stupid reasons but recently replaying it I found it an excellent game and I actually look forward to playing it again sometime. Let me start by saying that this game is in NO way connected to the movie.  This installment is almost completely unconnected to the Sands of Time trilogy, in fact the only character featured in this who was in the trilogy is the Prince.  When I first played the game I really hated this, looking back however I feel a lot of care went into giving the feel of playing the trilogy while still leaving the original story alone. Parkour is where in my oppinion this game shines, it feels like the trilogy on roids in this aspect. Everything just runs so fluid and the Prince is more agile than ever.  As the game progressed you obtain powers that allow you to control the environment which just adds to the amazing vibe the parkour gives off. What else can I say aside from I feel satisfied when I run up walls? Combat is almost completely different from the trilogy, you cannot duel wield in this game which honestly is a little dissapointing from the start for me. The combat in this game seems to focus on taking down numerous enemies at a time. I would be a liar if I said that I didn't enjoy the combat in this game but it could have been greatly improved. With the trilogy it was awesome to use the environment to your advantage, this game however is parkour and combat are hardly ever connected. It's a crying shame actually as I think the abilities you unlock could have had some interesting uses in battle. All in all for me this is a welcome addition to the franchise. If you are a fan of the trilogy I definitely reccomend giving this game a shot as more than likely you will like it. Just remember this has nothing to really do with the trilogy and although that may be a disappointment to some I for one am happy that the trilogy was not tampered with.			",77,47,1,32,12,0,8

												So far so good. Nothing much to complain about. Everything's pretty much okay. One thing though, I prefer the aestatics of the main character back when I was playing this series on my Playstation. Besides that, all is well. Oh, the new abilities in the game for mobility is probably just a minor addition to the gameplay but it's a good touch to The Forgotten Sands. As compared to The Two Thrones(The Dark Prince was awesome as hell), The Warrior Within, and The Sands of Time, these new added abilities puts the game on par with the rest, besides the most obvious thing, GRAPHICS are way better here. It's been a pleasure to have play the Prince of Persia Trilogy. :D			",31,6,0,3,4,0,0

												This game was hugely disappointing. It's the camera angles. In a game where you live or die by your ability to control the prince, the game dies, because even when you can control him it's painful to do so, and he ends up doing things which look stupid, like jumping at a forty five degree angle instead of directly toward a horizontal pole when missing means death, so it just feels stupid. The rest of the ingredients are all there and if there wasn't the one fundamental flaw which makes all the great features moot it would be one of the best (if not the best) of a good series, but instead it is the worst by a fair margin. If they'd just stuck the camera behind you (or given you that option) with commensurate controls, so you could run toward a pole and jump to the pole rather than having to guess whether you should be jumping ""West"" or ""Northwest""...Seriously this is a three dimensional game, so why should I only be able to move in precisely 8 directions, and those dictated by and gimped by the camera position? So close to a great game and yet so far. ",20,13,0,6,4,0,4

												The most recent release in the Prince of Persia franchise, The Forgotten Sands is an action adventure platformer that bridges the gap between The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. I got this game along with The Sands of Time which, in my opinion, isn't as good as The Forgotten Sands. BE WARNED: you have to create/log in with a Uplay account in order to play this game.I haven't gotten too far into the story, but it's not awful. It's not that great either, but it's good enough that you're at the very least slightly interested. Basically, it starts out with you going to visit your brother, only to find out your brother's palace/castle being attacked. You fight some enemies and get familiar with the platforming. Once you meet up with your brother, he tries to unleashe Solomon's Army, the only hope for not losing the battle. This doesn't go as planned since you are then told that army is evil. That's about all that happens at the very beginning.The gameplay is pretty fun. The swordfighting is enjoyable and well animated. You basically have three attacks: normal attack, strong attack, and aerial attack. Also, you can't block, just dive-roll. The platforming is very fun as well. Although it's really no different from the platforming in The Sands of Time, it seems more exciting in this game for some reason to me.The game looks great. Like I said, the animations are pretty good and the characters look awesome. As far as I've gotten into the game (which is only a few hours) there isn't much variation in the locations. However, this is probably because you're in the same place.The music is good too. Not the best soundtrack for a game I've ever heard, but it goes along nicely with the game.There are also a few extra things in this game: challenge maps and extra skins/costumes. You get one challenge map and costume by entering the CD key in the Extras menu. You can also get Ezio's costume from Assassin's Creed by buying it with points through Uplay.Overall, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is a pretty enjoyable experience. Fun combat and platforming and a relatively interesting story make this a good buy. The main things I don't like are the inability to block during combat and how a Uplay account is required to play, although this doesn't bother me a whole lot.I give this game an 8.5/10.

												Took me about 5 hours of research and etc to get the game to start up because of the DRM methods, but was well worth the effort;  Second best game in the The Sands of Times series in my opinion, with my favorite being The Two Thrones.  The Combat is great, does everything you ask it, and is very fluid and responsive.  Story is were this game is lacking very simple and very much predictable, enjoyable though.  Writing and script is good and well written, got a few good laughs at the lines at times, but lacking compared to earlar game in the series.  Definitely don't be afraid to pick this game up, its great, inprovement on  Prince of Persia (2008).			",149,52,4,5,9,2,12

												Brilliant platformer! The combat isn't as good as in the older games, but the platforming still makes it shine. If you loved jumping around in Assassin's Creed and like hack-n-slash games, then you'll be find ""The Forgotten Sands"" well worth your time (and money).			",80,14,1,3,2,2,3

												The story supposedly takes place between the first and second game.Once again you're swinging, jumping, and climbing on conveniently placed poles and ledges, pulling levers, and all the usual Prince of Persia ♥♥♥♥bizz.Clearly they gave it a touch of next gen but that had its downsides since they sort of removed some things that made the franchise what it is.Visually it's pretty nice but gameplay wise it feels so different.

												I've had trouble in the past and now once again with a new machine.  Uplay crashes every launch (windows 8.1).  Wish I bought this from a store so I could demand a refund.  Steam DRM with extra adware/bloatware in the form of Uplay is a massive failure.  I'm a big fan of the PoP series but once again legal users are being punished for purchasing a game with badly written DRM.			",55,21,0,15,2,0,9

												The game is a absolutely winner! Love the scenery, the jumps, puzzles, game mechanics and ofcourse music. I didn't like fights so much, i found them pretty hard (i love elevator part), but with combination of battle music and prince slashing his sword, you can pretty much enjoy them. Nice game and great introduction in POP series.			",176,13,9,10,5,0,5

												I bought this game because I love the Prince of Persia games and I obviously wanted to play the ""new super awesome Prince of Persia"". By the way: This was a huge mistake.The game´s combat system: Left mouse button to strike.That’s all!If you played the previous and OLDER games they have an amazing 3d combat system (someone who played them will know what I mean) and the developers threw everything of it in the trash bin.This is a sad day guy´s this series is dead for real...

												Forgotten Sands is a return to the style of the Sands of Time series. If you played the whole Sands of Time trilogy, and you hunger for more, Forgotten Sands will be perfect for you. If you're hoping for a new take on the franchise, you're looking in the wrong place - Forgotten Sands is not about innovation. It has the same plot and setting as every game in the Sands of Time trilogy, the same old Prince (snarky, not angsty) as ever, and the same kinds of puzzles and fights. (To be fair, the Prince gets a couple new abilities that he's never seen before to spice things up. Nothing groundbreaking, though.) However, it has refined all these so that the bad elements - quick time events, awkward chariot races, angsty Prince from the second game - have been removed and the good ones rebalanced to make them better. It is the Sands of Time trilogy with all the burrs polished away. Don't play this one first, but if you've already done the other three, Forgotten Sands is worth your time.			",183,86,0,18,12,2,23

												So far so good. Nothing much to complain about. Everything's pretty much okay. One thing though, I prefer the aestatics of the main character back when I was playing this series on my Playstation. Besides that, all is well. Oh, the new abilities in the game for mobility is probably just a minor addition to the gameplay but it's a good touch to The Forgotten Sands. As compared to The Two Thrones(The Dark Prince was awesome as hell), The Warrior Within, and The Sands of Time, these new added abilities puts the game on par with the rest, besides the most obvious thing, GRAPHICS are way better here. It's been a pleasure to have play the Prince of Persia Trilogy. :D			",31,6,0,3,4,0,0

												Let me start by saying this is the worst Prince of Persia among the recent ones. The story is very simple and comprised of only 4 characters. The combat and character movement are terribly clunky. The camera is annoying during platforming moments (using a controller makes it less awful). The levels are as linear as they can possibly get.Boss battles are bad jokes. Really. According to Ubisoft the best way to kill a giant is to strike his foot multiple times, as he will eventually die.Why am I recommending this game? Simple: I love platforming. Even though it is a terrible game, I enjoyed the platforming sections, obstacles and climbing challenges. Fortunately, it seems like it was known that the combat was so awful that they decided it should be a minor part of the game, so it could be best enjoyed this way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Prince of Persia is the best action adventure game but this one is different from the older PoP: The Two Throne. In The Two Throne you could kill the enemies silently and fighting with many enemies was harder,We needed to be clever but in The Forgotten Sands you are like one man army,you can kill many enemy by just tapping the attack button.But the gameplay,graphics,actions are very good.

												This is one of the better ones in the series. Perhaps not the best, but still great if you enjoy the series.What is good?Well, it looks nice, has an epic feel, it runs well, the mechanics are solid and controls are tight. It has all the Prince of Persia stuff, design and atmosphere. It has some new interesting gameplay elements as well. The game is not too hard, but not super easy either. It does not become frustrating.What is not so good?It is a little cheesy, and the voice acting is a little silly, but pretty much all the games in the series has had that. It plays much better with a game pad, which is only a negative if you don't have one. There are a couple of frustrating moments in the game, where when you die, you get pushed back quite far from where you died, and you have to see the cutscene again. You can bypass it, but after the umpeenth atempt you get a litte tired. But this is not a problem in general.A causal game?Well, in the beginning I found the game does not offer much challenge, but it is still quite enjoyable as it teaches you the mechanics bit by bit. It also has good variety and pace so it never feels boring. I played through the entire game quite quickly compared to older titles, but I did not mind. At times it felt like a game to play during breaks, hence the casual feel. But it is still an enjoyable experience.			",149,34,4,16,9,1,4
