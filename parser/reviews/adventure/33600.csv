""I may not be making millions of dollars and I may not have thousands of nubile if uncritical young women lusting for my body but I've got something you haven't... this small piece of coal."" - George StobbartNot as intriguing and well-arranged as the first instalment of the series, Broken Sword 2 - The Smoking Mirror still is a nice adventure and a decent sequel to a wondrous game. First and foremost, I am happy to announce that there has been no content cut in this remastered version compared to '97 original. Everything there was in the first place, is still there contrary to Director's Cut version of the first game. Also, it might be significant to mention that this is the only game in the series that wouldn't center around a mystery concerning Knight Templars.It is a couple months after the first game's end. George has been back to America for some time to attend personal businesses - no spoilers - and Nico has been left alone in Paris. Without supervision from George and already having a knack for getting into trouble, Nico starts to investigate a party of drug smugglers that would import cocaine from South America in the guise of importing historical artifacts for a gallery. Nico gets her hands on a small Mayan tablet and André arranges a meeting with Professor Oubier, an expert on the Mayan culture and artifacts for consultation. Just coming back to Paris in time for the said meeting, George meets Nico as they arrive at Oubier's house together, only to be apprehended and left in a burning house! As Nico gets abducted by a South American Indian alongside the mysterious tablet, George starts yet another adventure after a criminal mystery which will soon turn very much esoteric.Well, let's take a look upon this lovely setting. I have to declare that the story and power dynamics behind the scenes aren't as elaborate as the first game. It is pretty much black and white, good vs. evil this time, which is slightly disappointing. George and Nico are as witty and as able as ever though, with a notch of sexual innuendo building in between. Humor is slightly crueler and highly sarcastic too. Nico is a highly influential character in this game compared to the previous one though, not only a pretty side-kick waiting for George to save the day. As another side point, the ending wasn't that much of a satisfaction, considering the game cuts player involvement just before the actual ending sequence, leaving us with a cartoon cinematic. Oh, well... you can't always get what you want.Display is nearly identical to the previous game. Hand-drawn art with engaging atmospheres and animated cartoon cinematics with classic scenes. Music is lovely as always too. Sadly, we are presented portrait close-ups of characters up on the screen in this remastered version, very much like the Director's Cut. Facial expressions of characters are a bit limited with those, and they mostly end up presenting characters unsympathetic, contrary to the original tone of the game. In those portraits, George was practically pouting half the time, and Nico always had an expression as if she just stepped onto something unpleasant.As for the gameplay, it is slightly lesser compared to the first instalment. Some combination actions cannot be achieved before proper dialogue is triggered, even though the action would be quite obvious. You gotta step through everything in proper order to proceed. Fast transportation between scenes aren't there anymore either, so you keep walking on a somewhat prolonged pace. Puzzles are okay, yet not challenging much. You figure out everything at the first glance. They just mostly take time to get through, rather than actually thinking how to deal with. On a note, there is a truck load of funny easter eggs in this game, winking to some pop culture references or other games from the developer team, such as Beneath a Steel Sky. Wanna see a goat in existential crisis? Intriguing.Last call? Broken Sword 2 - The Smoking Mirror is a decent sequel to a glorious first game, a break from the Templar storyline and an opportunity for our characters to build some more common ground + character development. If you enjoyed the first game, there is no reason that you wouldn't like this one. It is the slightly lesser cousin of the previous anyhow. As George and Nico's story continues, we are to live a lot more with them soon.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Broken Sword 2 is a decent sequel to Broken Sword 1, but definitely weaker than the original. The story is not as good, with a far more black and white us vs them (while the original had three factions which made the story more interesting). For the longest time I was afraid they had remade Nico into nothing but a side-character who does nothing but get rescued, but luckily she does get to do more stuff later in the game.The biggest let down was the number of time-wasting puzzles though. I.e. puzzles that are not hard to figure out, but takes a long time to do... or in the case of the jungle section, not even to do, just walking around (in the directors cut of the first game it was possible to fasttravel by dubbelclicking... the remastered version of the second does not seem to have that). Or when you want to tie two things together with a rope and you click on one of them and George instead says it would be better to tie it to the other first... instead of just doing that.Together with some puzzles that have frankly stupid or contrived solutions (or the puzzles themselves are contrived) it certainly makes it weaker than the first game and far shorter. Sure it took me 7h vs the 10h of the original, but I'd still say it was half as short... the additional two hours felt artificially prolonged by the time-wasting aspect of some of the puzzles. However, while it is IMO weaker than the first game, it is still a good adventure game. If you enjoyed the first you will probably enjoy this one for the most part. If you haven't played the first, start with that instead.			",150,199,0,26,17,1,26

			Buy Broken Sword 2 - https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/r/smokingmirror Heres my review out Broken Sword 2 The Smoking mirrors the sequel to Shadow of templars (review can be found from my channel as well) it...		

 Broken Sword 2 Remastered ReviewThe game takes place after 6 months of the first game following the story of Nico and George. Instead of templars they will be following a lead regarding a Mayan Artifact </Synopsis>. Some critics/fans held Shadow of templars better than Smoking mirror but for my personally tastes i find this game lot better. Not only from dialogue aspects and better graphics, but also from story/length. Its somewhat shorter than previous game, but thats how i prefer my Adventure games (Not too long) Great Points Better story than in first game, less siderailing & filler hubs Cool characters making return from first game Mayan's are pretty cool subject Great & Funny dialogue Bad Points Some very minor bugs do occur by clicking sometimes the objectives (Nothing too drastic) Was wishing for more puzzles, first game had more ",425,179,5,53,33,3,42

												Like far too many other sequels, the game doesn't live up to the expectations its predecessor set forth. Though it is well produced and solid, a worthy sequel. It may be more linear than the first, but the luscious visuals and gameplay more than make up for that. In the second half of the game you play as both Nico and George separately, at opposite sides of the world, which helps break up the environments. 


The happy end - George, Nico and their son.

												Broken Sword 2 offers pretty much identical gameplay to the first one. The story on this one felt less than believable and was often times plain comical. Like the first one, this is a very casual adventure; the puzzles are extremely easy, plus the blue markers remove any difficulty in finding whatever you need. There is also a hint system in the unlikely event you ever get stuck. The movement is still slow paced. Often times you have to wait for an animation sequence to complete and you can't double-click to run or quickly move from one location to the next. Overall, it was is a reasonably well done adventure game that feels a little dated.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												7.9/10 - Solid Point and Click Adventure; Falls Short of Original!I really enjoyed this next installment of the series, but it definitely fell short when compared to the first. The campaign is only about 7 hours and that's with really slow walking animation, no quick travel when leaving a room and delayed dialogue at times. If you don't get frustrated with that then this is a follow-up worth playing!We find George and Nico 6 months later, and it appears things didn't end happily ever after. After an impromptu break up George comes across information that Nico is now missing. He will have to once again circumnavigate the globe, beat the bad guys and protect the sacred Mayan stones! Overall, I had a lot of fun with this, it’s worth the $1/hour price tag. It's half the length of the original so pay accordingly. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

PROS:+ great story telling+ atmosphere of an adventure+ (mostly) fun puzzles+ no clumsy & ugly 3D graphics (like in BS3 & BS4)+ good voice acting+ most compatibility issues fixed in Remastered versionCONS:- some puzzles make less sense- hints added by the Remastered version take from the challenge- ""quick time events"" which feel a bit out of place compared to the point&click styleComment:I first played this game over a decade ago. I picked it up before playing BS1. Along with my dad we would sit down and try to solve the puzzles and find the correct item combinations to move us forward in the storyline. The game felt relaxing and I really enjoyed that time. I finished it a couple of times since then and I got this Remastered version to see if it can replace my decaying CDs and to see a fix for the compatibility issues the game had. And yes, this Remastered edition is worth it. BS2 is not the best game in the world but it's fun and enjoyable. Very relaxing too, apart from the QTEs where you had to time something otherwise you were screwed. While I get the concept it felt out of place for this adventure game style. I also do not like the hints but simply just because I played the original version and I see how it takes the challenge out. But that is just my opinion on them. Overall a good game worth your time so I recommend it to all fans of the point&click genre.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

Broken Sword 2 - the Smoking Mirror: Remastered	* 7/10A fresh Remastered edition for a great sequel of Broken Sword. Again we see Our protagonists George and Nico Kicked straight in action... Well, maybe just George because Nico's being kidnapped by a huge thug from the empty house of a disappeared archeologist she was supposed to interview. So George finds himself tied to a chair with a posonous spider slowly approaching him.I enjoyed the story from this chapter, the exotic locations you have to visit and the silly atomsphere and situations happening through the game are kind of a constant of the whole series. You will also meet some old friend from the first Broken Sword.The interface is the same classic used in the previous game: a classic point & click setup, with mouse controls, a classic inventory system and most importantly many choices of subjects for dialogues with other characters. As a Remastered edition you can easily notice the backgrounds and the landscapes are improved. Unfortunately the characters are still rendered in poor resolution which I don't actually understand the reason behind this lack.+++Pros+++ STORY. I really enjoyed this chapter, You jump into action, your investigations will bring you again all around the world but the most imortant is the end. I also really liked some funny moments, and the way towards the end George and Nico get separate sequences, to join back again. RIDDLES. As usual all along the game there are Some nice puzzles, especially towards the end. REMASTERED. This chapter has been remastered so you can enjoy even more all the locations and landscapes you'll run through the game, though...---Cons--- HALF-REMASTERED. ...The characters look quite poorly detailed as if they're still the old animations from the original game which doesn't quite make sense to me. ODD RIDDLES AND MAZE. Some Puzzles are not as good as the rest of the game or as the previous Broken Sword, not to mention the swamp maze where it was quite hard to figure the hot zones to go in other directions. But I guess it's just me being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because I bet that wasn't even meant to be that great maze I felt like. RUSHED LAST SECTION. I had the feeling that the Story was a little rushed towards the end. It's not like it sucks, I alrady stated I enjoyed the plot. It's just that it looked rushed, somehow. ",497,128,12,20,23,4,28

												Very interesting sequel to the first amazing Broken Sword game. Whilst not as good as the original, I feel this game still belongs in the hall of fame for point and click adventures. It continues all the great elements that the first game had, and has it's own interesting continuation of the characters. The only downside to this game I feel is the character artwork for Nicole, the artwork portraying her character animation looks horrible compared to the facial conversation artwork, I can't believe they didn't improve it. Still, it's a great game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Those who are fans of point-and-click adventures will love this as the logic train derailed sometime between the first and second game and you  Will  be needing that help system or a heap of patience; to be honest, probably both. Definitely a great series for the genre with a mostly solid plot and an actual possibility of dying this time around. The only downside I can see is a comparitively short play time compared to the first game even with the two unnecessarily long puzzles towards the end.			",199,53,0,29,22,3,16

												An excellent sequel to the classic Broken Sword. It has all the compelling adventuring and puzzle solving of the first game, this time much of it in South America. The main remastering is the addition of portraits of the characters during dialogue to make conversations less boring. A highly recommended and under-rated adventure game, especially if you like the first Broken Sword.			",1920,829,74,198,246,21,315

												The short version review is this: if you like the Point & Click genre, you will most likely enjoy this.What are pros for some people may be cons for another, so here are some general points to consider:*Puzzles are the usual P&C fare, meaning not always intuitive in terms of solution.  If you already enjoy the genre, you already know this and it won't bother you much.  If you are newer to the genre, you just have to remember the all-purpose ""click on everything"" rule and ""combine your inventory with anything you can no matter how strange it seems"" rule.  There's nothing too farfetched.*Voice acting is quite good for the most part and the interactions are fully voiced, which I appreciate.  Sound and music in general is nicely done.*Art is very cartoon-ish.  That could be a selling point for somel; it certainly isn't for me.  However, despite being sort of a snob about art style, I will say that it is very well done even though it's not a style I love.  It in no way detracted from the overall game for me, and some people might absolutely love it.*The story was good, taking our heroes into Mayan Central America this time.  The end was a bit abrupt but did tie up the story nicely.  The addition of some optional graphic novel content helps flesh out the gap between this game and its predecessor.*There is a built-in help system for when you get stuck, which you can choose to use if you like (or can ignore, if you like!).  The help is ""progressive hint"" style, giving you the option to start with a very vague hint and work your way up to a detailed solution if you're still stuck.  While some people consider this absolute heresy, others will appreciate not having to track down a detailed walkthrough for help on one small point.*Play time is shorter than some comparable games.  I clocked in at around six hours, plowing straight through and not getting too hung up on anything (I'm too impatient to wait too long before checking to see what I missed!).  For someone not using any hints, it could probably take a couple hours longer.So, I would recommend not only this game, but picking up the trilogy in a package if you don't have any of the games already.  It's a great deal and definitely worth it.			",237,495,1,70,42,0,32

												I Have been a Broken Sword Fan Since 1996 but when they released Broken Sword 3 I didnt get on with it and pretty much walked away from the series. I still had Broken Sword 1 & 2 to replay which were both fantastic. When I heard Broken Sword was coming back with Broken Sword 5 I had realised I really did walk away from the series as I didnt even know there was a 4th lol. Now that all 5 games have been released on Steam as an oldschool fan I will be playing through 1 & 2 again and then I will go into 3 and 4 with an open mind and look forward to the return to a 2d adventure game in 5. I have the original CD copy of 1 & 2, but when I saw they were re released as a remastered directors cut's on Steam I decided to buy them again.Broken Sword 2 - The Smoking Mirror:RemasteredAgain with a remastered version I was a little aprehensive, more so with BS2R as BS2 is my favourite BS to date (I havent played 3,4 & 5 yet. As we all know when creators go back and mess with things that were already great they can make alterations that will annoy returning fans etc.With BS2R, they basically left the core game as the original was back in 1997. With BS1DC they took out some chunks and you couldent actually die as you could in the original 96 version. In BS2R they left the ability to die firmly in place and didnt take out the blood. The additions were nice like the new dialogue boxes and some new easter eggs which were not in the original.I would recommend this game to Vetran Broken Sword fans to replay through this great game again. I would also strongly recommend this game to any other 2D adventure game fans (Grim Fandango, Monkey Island etc.) who may have missed the Broken Sword series.Very pleased with this as I was back in 97.I have yet to play 5 but lets hope with its success more Broken Swords will follow.

												Read the review for Broken Sword 1 at: https://cassus.org/muut/#!/adventure:review-broken-sword-shadOh boy, this sure is a Adventure game from the 90's, MAN, LOOK AT THOSE SEQUELS! Yes, I am going to review a couple of sequels from the Broken Sword franchise, I'll mostly focus of the differences with the first one though, as I explained how I felt about that game with detail, so I left a link up there, for you to read it, but you probably already saw that, unless you're reading it upside-down, then, good for you!Broken Sword 2 picks up 6 months after the original left off, George and Nico started dating, but George had to go back to the States because of his father's health problems, which caused them to break up. Now, most of the game you will be playing as George, and one thing that bugged me is that he never really talks to Nicole about his sudden departure, and I think they needed to get deeper into it . I really want to see them happily together, it's kind of like the Mulder-Scully problem.After a while though, George returned to Paris, only to find that Nico had an appointment with an archaeologist because of an odd stone she'd found, only for them to discover they've been set up, and they knock them both out, kidnap Nicole and leave George to die, at the hands of a terrible, evil, and psychotic… spider? Well, they've set the house on fire, but I didn't find a point to the spider, but I digress.George then goes to the rescue of Nico, and after finding her, she explains that the man who kidnapped her was thought to be in a drug ring and that Nico was tracing him, but now she suspects there might be a connection with an even deeper conspiracy.I can't really go into the story, I might've even spoiled the fact that George rescues her, but still, there's really not much to go into without spoiling, but the story is really interesting and worthwhile, an overall improvement over the first one.The gameplay is pretty much the same, ya think, ya point, and ya click. But the UI and several tweaks to the engine and some mechanics makes the small differences good, for example, now you can cancel an action by selecting another one, which you couldn't in the first one, smalls changes like that that really improves the game in my opinion.Now, the puzzles on the other hand are harder, there's really nothing obvious, and you have to do some serious thinking to get out of some situations, but still, most of it makes sense, you've just got to do some exploring and talking to people to get somewhere. There is one or other puzzle that is somewhat insane, but nothing too bad.There are also some comedic situations that are really worth while and quite funny, just remember to get that coal.The graphics and voice acting though, now that's what I call an improvement, the game looks much better than it's antecessor, and the voice acting is top-notch, the in-game animations are much better, the music is too an improvement over the first one, the music theme also complements really well this game's theme.The game really looks and sounds great.Overall, this game is an improvement over the original, mostly little things, but improvement nonetheless, I recommend it, but for starters, the original one should be played first, for a better introduction and building of the characters.Read more Video Game reviews at: cassus.org ",222,59,5,16,22,1,22

												tl;dr scoreboard:+ George Stobbart is still one of the most likeable protagonists around+ Somewhat interesting premise+ Great HD comic book bundled in the game+ Remaster hotspots eliminates pixel hunting- Limited interaction between George and Nico- Jungle locations aren't the most interesting- Being a dickbag can kinda break the immersion- Your characters can at times be really slow- The Remaster HD portraits don't fit with the rest of the gameThe Smoking Mirror IMHO doesn't reach the greats of The Shadow of the Templars. Smoking Mirror deals with Central American mythology, which should be as interesting as the Knights Templars in the first game... unfortunately, it isn't. Much of the game is spent in the Caribbean jungle, which just isn't as interesting or vibrant as Paris and the rest of the first game was. Furthermore, George and Nico are separated for much of the game, which sucks as their banter really is a high point of the series!A big problem, as I see it, is also that the ethics of George and Nico seem to bounce all over the place: They seem like nice, respectful people - until they suddenly start smashing priceless artifacts, trapping people to steal their private property and causing harm to innocents to accomplish their own goals. All while smiling and cracking jokes. Some of these actions go very poorly with the usual likeability of the two protagonists, and can tend to break immersion at points and make the game a little too Monkey Island'ish. Monkey Island never took itself seriously - Broken Sword 2 seems unsure of whether it wants to or not.Also, due to your characters having to walk pre-defined pathes, when at sections of the game that require a lot of running around, the game can seemingly slow to a crawl. It's not as bad as a game like Syberia, but the impatient will probably be annoyed.There are animated sequences in this game, but they are few, far apart and all end very abruptly. It's like watching Disney on a budget!The ""Remastered"" edition, unfortunately, is really a detriment to the game, as the new HD portraits don't fit with the classic graphics AT ALL, and much of the time breaks the immersion, as the portraits have a very limited range of emotions.Still, the old George Stobbart charm is still present, and his witty remarks really carry a game that would otherwise somewhat suck. All in all, though, this is by far the worst of the original 3 Broken Sword games, and, really, should be skipped by anyone who is not a dedicated fan of the series.			",335,171,3,44,33,1,47

												If you haven't played the first Broken Sword, go do that first. Although it isn't really necessary to understand the plot, there are a few references that you'll miss which might diminish the experience. Anyway, the Smoking Mirror was a very good sequel. It didn't really change anything from the original, but that's a good thing. The new plot is pretty interesting and takes you to new and exotic locations. If you liked Broken Sword 1, I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. It was a bit short, but still very enjoyable throughout the entire game. Lots of funny and memorable moments, definitely worth the occasional frustration caused by some of the puzzles. Besides, you can always just use a walkthrough if you get really stuck.

												Honestly, I think the criticism for this game is a little too harsh. It's another of my  childhood games that continues the story of George and Nicole from the excellent prequel - this time around centering the story around Mayan mythology. It's not a very long or difficult game and it doesn't have the same depth as the first did, but it's still a nice ride from start to finish. Fortunately Nicole is a much more important character this time around, and not just a lazy sidekick sitting on her butt in Paris most of the time. The game is much more linear than the first game - there are no maps or locations and they always follow one path. The graphics looks much better though with beautiful 2D art and gorgeous lush locations. Definitely a game any point-and-click adventure fan should already have played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like the first one, this is another great point and click adventure game, with the more classic feel to it. I pretty much said all I could about these games in the recommendation for the first one, but I guess one notable thing would be this one is definitely not as long as the first one. The first one was actually pretty lengthy and took me a few days to complete, where as this one is easily done in a day. With that said, it’s still worth a go. In this one you can unlock little bonus content as you go along, a little comic book type thing that fills in some gaps that the game doesn’t. Which I thought was a nice addition to the game, and it actually fits the style of the game pretty well.The art is great and the storyline for both games are decent, this franchise is definitely a good one for anyone’s point and click adventure section in their library. Although I can’t speak for the third one, as I have yet to play it still. Which in honesty I am a little put off by the fact they changed the whole style and went 3D.All in all, I think the first two of this franchise is a definite recommendation for fans of the genre.

												Let me just start off with saying i'm not a huge fan of the Point and Click genre, but when I saw Broken Sword 2 it looked like a pretty cool game. When I first booted up the game the menu was lacking in detail, but that was not what I was here for. When I got into the game I was greeted with a honestly cool cartoon for the first part of the game. So then there I was in the game that I would love. The story is great, characters are great, point and click mechanics are great, great puzzles, ETC.Overall 10/10			",150,29,1,19,11,1,5

												Even though my guess is that most of the people who'll buy this game are familiar with the version that came out 19 years ago, I'd just assume there are new gamers who want to know whether it's worth checking out. So, here we go!Broken Sword 2 - the Smoking Mirror is an adventure game that has its fair share of flaws. But oh boy, is it fun!The game was released in 1997, back in the golden era of point and click adventure games (after the huge success of the first game), and I'm so happy to say it's aged quite well. In fact, I found the character portraits/facial expressions which are exclusive to the remastered edition completely unnecessary. Most of them are plain bad (starting with George's and Nico's) while others bear no resemblance to the actual characters they represent.The Smoking Mirror is incredibly slow paced. You can't make your heroes run nor can you double-click on a location to be instantly transferred there. If you're striving for fast gameplay, you can rest assured there's none here.One more thing - the game is very linear. Even though you get to travel the globe with George and Nico and visit so many places - most of them really colorful and interesting (bar London) - you are actually ""stuck"" in one place until you solve all the puzzles which are required to advance the story. Gone is the map from the first game that allows you to choose where you want to go and gives you the freedom of exploring the game the way you want it.This also makes The Smoking Mirror shorter than many other games from the time (and more recent ones) - the game can be finished in 5-6 hours and there's not much to come back to once the main story is over (there are only a few easter eggs throughout the game).Flaws aside, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror is still a must for every (true) fan of adventure games. The story will get you hooked from the start and you'll want to get to the bottom of the mystery revolving around a stone of Mayan origin and a (missing) professor. Of course, being a classic adventure game, TSM will make you face all kinds of obstacles and puzzles that have to be solved using your brain. Most of them (I'd say 85%) are based on pure logic so you shouldn't have too many problems if you've played other adventure games (or you can always go with the popular method of using all your inventory items with world objects/characters until you get a winning combination). Also, the remastered version includes a progressive hint system, so you can find your way around even the most complex puzzles in no time. Most of the characters have been voiced really well, while the music is nice and never gets in the way. There's just enough music to make for a relaxed atmosphere or a tense moment. The ambient sounds are also up to par.One final thing to note is that there are a few places where making the wrong decision will get your hero(es) killed. If you haven't played classic adventure games from the 90s, you may find this strange, but it was considered perfectly normal back then. So, save often and you won't have to restart the game from a much earlier point.All in all, Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror is the sequel to a fantastic adventure game that tries to keep the winning formula (more or less) intact and make some things even simpler, resulting in a casual-player-friendly title. The remastered version goes one step further in this regard and throws a hint system (and a nice diary) in the mix, making sure that you never get stuck and that you finish what could've definitely been a longer story (with a rushed final chapter) even faster. Still, it's more than deserving of your attention, especially if you get it on sale.			",172,92,5,40,24,1,46

												The second installment to the Broken Sword series... What can I say, as a kid I spent the longest time trying to figure out what to do during the demo, instead I kept on making the guy at the wharf, fart while eating beans. No regrets, definitely a key point to the plot. Loved it then, still love it now.I cannot find any flaws with the game itself, beyond the part where they started to make things just a little more challenging, but that in itself is a reward.

												Pros:-Stobbart is a very likeable character, some parts involving him were humorous. -Although, I didn't like the new portraits in BS1, I think they really helped with Stobbarts delivery of his lines in this one. Cons:-Some of the puzzles just seemed random, non intuitive, illogical, etc to me. I'd just use the hints after 15 min of clicking around because I value my time.-The characters move SLOW! And those above is what stood out to me the most. It's a good, not great. Fun, but sometimes frustrating adventure game. The voice acting is great once again. The story is... a little childish for my tastes but I would have ate it up when I was younger. The silly moments (involving Stobbart) are what entertained me the most.I recommend it because, if you are looking at it's store front page right now, you know what you are getting into, which is an old cheap adventure game.  And you might be wondering if it is 'good for it's time', and the answer is ""yes"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short version: 85%Broken Sword 2 is a typical sequel: it offers more exotic places (mostly Central America) and a greater number of complicated puzzles. Although it isn’t as polished as the original, and has a good chunk of mandatory going around in circles, it is still a fun adventure game.Long version:Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror wasn’t exactly on par with the acclaimed original: initially it was regarded as a disappointment, but the low quality of the third and fourth games elevated its status in the following years. It is really not bad though, just not as good as the first one.The plot tries to up the ante by changing the Templar mythos to Mayan gods, legends, and doomsday predictions, but the new enemies are nowhere near as organised or threatening as the Neo-Templars were, and the low variety of scenery (mostly jungles) make it feel more of a step backwards. There are also several parts where progression is tied to lots of talking and running around in circles, unnecessarily halting progression.There is much larger focus on dialogues, which undoubtedly have improved a lot since the first game, along with the voice acting and the audio quality. Thank heavens these conversations are rarely plot dumps, but unless you like slow-paced adventure games, they will feel like just padding added there to prolong game time.The puzzles themselves followed the Monkey Island formula: even more complicated, even less logical. Their main focus is to disguise the slightly shorter run time of about 8-10 hours. (If you don’t get lost. If you try the jungle maze without help, you can wander there for days.) Don’t worry though; it’s not King’s Quest of Gabriel Knight 3 levels, just old-school adventure game difficulty, perfect for anyone who wants some old-school point ‘n’ click adventure.

												As much fun as the first, I thought Broken Sword 2 was even more enjoyable.  The art style and the voice acting and writing are excellent, and I felt very engaged with the story and the puzzles.  That said many puzzles, even the early ones were too difficult for me without a bunch of hints, but at least the game acknowledges that with the in-game hints, and it's quite possible that has more to do with me being terrible at puzzles than with the game!  Really enjoyed, a must-buy for anyone who likes point and click adventure games, and I'm looking forward to playing the next installment.			",146,31,5,11,8,1,26

												I'm surprised when I read the reviewers' opinions about Broken Sword 2. Apparetly this game wasn't as well received as the first one. Why?! In my opinion it's even better! The first game was brilliant of course though. And this one starts a completely new adventure, not reated to the Templar storyline (so kinda irrelevant to the title ""Broken Sword""), but there are references to it and you meet some of the same characters again. The story is fascinating, I managed to interest my cousin with it even though he never plays such games. And the riddles are even better and more satisfying to solve in this game in my opinion. Overall I love this game. I was happy to play it again after all these years in this Remastered edition. Which by the way has no significant changes: they gave it a new interface with help system for those who are stuck and too tired to think, and they added portraits of the characters speaking.

												More of the same from Broken Sword. With no need to change an already strong formula, this sequel delivers exactly what you're wanting if you've played the first game: more of the first game. More wit, more charm, more places to explore, more headache enducing confusing puzzles and more mysteries to solve. It is strange to say that opting for no-change over change is a brave move, but these days it is in gaming. So many sequels get it wrong and take away something many love for something or another many hate. So here we are. Broken Sword 2 is a braveish clone/sequel to an excellent game and is an excellent game by proxy.			",163,49,2,19,8,0,28

												Playtime: 5h + 2h45m (Online + Offline)A worthy sequel to the first Broken Sword, Broken Sword and the Smoking Mirror mantains all the positive aspects from the previous installment on the series and on some cases even improves them. The only con in relation to the first game is the playtime, which I found it shorter by some 3 hours. Anyhow, Broken Sword 2 deals, yet again, with an interesting theme, this time, the Mayans and their myth of the god Tezcatlipoca. It's different from the Templars and in a good way. The graphics and animations are pretty much the same and Broken Sword still can achieve to be a comical game at some stages. The ending was the only aspect I found a bit disappointing, as it looked to be kind of rushed out and after the main enemy had been dealt with... It simply ended. Concluding, if you enjoyed the first Broken Sword - you will most surely enjoy the second one.

												It was literally as if another team worked on the sequel. Everything that was done well in the first was just mangled up in this Smoking Mirrors. In BS1, George was an easy going guy with a ready smile - intensely likeable, in BS2 he was frowning and had this disgusted look on his face half the time. The character interaction and writing in BS1 was intensely witty and funny, the script of BS2 has its funny moments but was more cynical and mean spirited. Nico was voice acted by a different person and the new actress's voice over was terrible. Though George did a lot of the leg work in the first Broken Sword, you still felt that Nico was an active partner in the relationship. She was just completly useless in BS2. She was pranced around like a little princess waiting for George to do everything. Content wise: BS2 was a lot shorter then BS1 which was a godsend given the heavily reduced quality of the production, I just wanted to move along to 3 as quickly as possible. Unless you're a hardcore fan, I'd give number 2 a skip.			",73,42,5,14,4,0,1

												I'm going to BARELY give this one the thumbs up. This game felt much like most sequels to popular movies are rushed and not done quite as well as its predecessor. Ever seen Ocean's Twelve? Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom? Jaws 2? Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen? Quantum of Solace? Grease 2? Son of the Mask? Now I'm not saying that all of these movies were downright terrible, although many of them were pretty bad. What I'm trying to show is that none of these ever lived up to the first movie in the series and this game is unable to live up to the high standard of Broken Sword 1 (If you would like, I have a review on Broken Sword 1 as well). Few movies and video games ever do, but they are out there that can match and sometimes do better. Monkey Island 2? Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers?The story seemed like a quick weekend brain storming session that they slapped together (I ended up finding the game to be very linear and lacking in plot), the character interactions were unpleasant (I fell in love with the characters of George and Nico, but in this game they act like jerks and lost much of their appeal. And the sunglasses, really?), and the puzzles were slightly more simplistic than the first. So pretty much everything I had enjoyed before was now gone.I do understand that if people become attached to a video game or movie series that it is possible to overlook these not so great aspects and still enjoy what others find to be terrible. For me, Monkey Island and Indiana Jones fall into this category. People will continue to complain about Escape from Monkey Island, Temple of Doom, and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I can see where these people are coming from, but surprisingly enough, none of them bother me. If you are a die hard fan of Broken Sword 1, you should probably get this game. If not, you could probably live without it.Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!			",10,38,0,0,1,0,1

												While I enjoyed the first entry, Broken Sword 2 is mired with unintiuitive reasoning, slow screen transitions, and very linear series events required to solve puzzles. Without the ingame hints this would have been abandoned due to frustration. Some bugs are present, a few solutions didn't work despite being the correct action until the second or third attempt, or the action would default to a different command entirely.The inherent problems with the game made it very difficult to enjoy the story.

												Well, not much of improvement over the original.Pro- story with cutscenes- music- voice acting- art style, animation- some humor- satisfying end- multiple save slots with completion %Con- some disturbing actions, one is when you trow a dog in the sea- slow walking speed- backtracking and conversations over and over- puzzles only work after specific time and conversation happened,   even if you have all components needed- puzzles so convoluted it's annoying not satisfying or smart- conversations end suddenly, changing the tone, if you exhaust all of  the conversation options suddenly you get a cut off 'bye now'- puzzles utilize items once then all of a sudden,   other items are utilized multiple times- some puzzles require items that other characters have but you   are not told about it and you can't look at their inventory- trying everything on anything because you can't figure out what  they want you to do, then looking for the hint and finding out how  easy it was or how ridiculously bad puzzle, then you realize that  the hint system is not optional it's required because you would be stuck for hours wasting your precious time- if you die you can't quickly load the game, unskippable cutscenesAnd i have played the disk with the original and still needed to use   the hints 4 times, because the puzzles were so bad, i didn't remember  them, the good ones just clicked in my mind.6/10 rating.   Buy it on sale.			",189,29,1,25,6,2,30

												Simply put, it's a good game.Just not as good as the original. The lack of actual puzzles and the use of event triggeres to propel the game's events just made the designfeel lazy in comparison to the first one.Don't get me wrong. It's still a really good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I enjoyed the first entry, Broken Sword 2 is mired with unintiuitive reasoning, slow screen transitions, and very linear series events required to solve puzzles. Without the ingame hints this would have been abandoned due to frustration. Some bugs are present, a few solutions didn't work despite being the correct action until the second or third attempt, or the action would default to a different command entirely.The inherent problems with the game made it very difficult to enjoy the story.

												The first Broken Sword was a breezy international conspiracy thriller with fun puzzles and atmosphere and not too much Adventure Game Moon-Logic. Its sequel feels like it was designed by someone who hates you.The ridiculous Adventure Game Moon-Logic isn't even the worst offender. The helpful hint system still lets you make short work of the worst offenders there (and boy howdy are there some bad ones.) No, Broken Sword 2's problem is that it wastes your time by making you backtrack, hammer through everything procedurally, use all your items on every point of interaction, talk to everyone, find a thing to do, then go talk to everyone again to see if that's opened new dialogue options, repeat ad nauseam. It's not about the intuitive leaps that make adventure gaming great; it's about your tolerance for the slog.Being short isn't some egregious sin. If Broken Sword 2 only has enough content for X hours, I'd rather play that game than spend twice as many hours playing a game that has no respect for my time or the value of dramatic pacing.

												I was kind of so-so on Broken Sword 1, but I approached Broken Sword 2 with an open mind, hoping that some of the things I didn't like in the first one would be fixed. In fact, it's the good things that were chipped away; the bad things were only amplified.Pros:+Idea for the story is interesting+Same main characters and art style as Broken Sword 1 (assuming you liked them)Cons:- Lots of puzzles with annoying, nonsensical solutions that frustrated me to no end- Story is not well fleshed out and is very poorly paced. After an interesting intro, the story stagnates and barely anything happens until the end. I remember repeatedly thinking ""What am I doing here? Why am I talking to these people? What does this have to do with the story?"" Finally in the end, the whole story is wrapped up in a single (non-interactive) cutscene.- Shorter, less mysterious, less suspenseful, more linear, less intricate version of the first game.

												I own the entire Broken Sword Series, the earlier series 1-3 on my phone and 5 on my computer. The Smoking Mirror is an excellent Point-Click Adventure game. I can't say enough good things about the entire Broken Sword series but if you're interested in intriguing and fun adventures, something that has some historical relevance and some taste of reality and fiction, then these games are well worth a try. Without spoiling too much, the destinations were very interesting, I love the two main characters in the story, the protagonists are believable and the intermittent characters and plots are allot of fun. I literally felt like I was watching a movie or reading a really good book. Lastly the game implements a quarry guide which helps you out in the stickiest of puzzles. Highly recommended if you love Point-Click adventure games. ",64,37,1,2,7,0,10

												When I first purchased and installed BSII:TSM it was the original 1997 version. By the time I got around to playing, it had been upgraded to the ""remastered"" 2010 edition. I don't know what the difference is but it would have been nice to be given the choice between the two rather than to force it on me. Apparently the update is aimed towards iOS and Android devices, not so great for PCs.The difference between this and the first game in the series is fairly apparent. There are less engaging puzzles. It's more trial and error, typical point-and-click mechanics. The story is fairly bland but was interesting enough to keep me going.Some parts are frustrating in a bad way. Having to complete things in a specific order to unlock a certain conversation option, when another method is clearly apparent yet unapproachable, is so very typical of many poorly designed adventure games of the '90s and BSII is no different.There are many abrupt animation cues and continuity errors that make scene transitions jarring. The ending seemed rushed too; there was no closing dialogue, it just cuts to credits. Not to mention the credit title theme song repeats three times. There are also many grammatical errors and typos present in the subtitles. You will often hear a character say something completely different to what you are reading, not to mention some of the voice acting is terrible. Nico's character sounds completely different from the first game, I did not enjoy her performance at all.BSII may have been an amazing game for its time, but it doesn't hold a flame to the likes of the Monkey Island series, and it doesn't particularly hold up to today's standards either, even with the recent remastered upgrade. There are still many issues plaguing the update that were meant to be fixed, including poor sound quality that continues to persist.I can only recommend this game if you're a die hard fan of the genre.

												Everything bad about this style of adventure game in one game.  I mean even the story was bad.  And what is with George's girlfriend?  Everytime he's away from France for 2 seconds she starts sleeping with someone else and they have to rebuild their relationship from scratch in the current episode.  Play the Gabriel Knight games instead.  It has the same boy/girl dynamic and general kind of mystery but is much better written.			",142,142,1,44,18,1,48

												I begrudge to admit that this is one of the few games I actually put downAt its heart, it's a soul-sequel to Broken Sword 1 (in that the dynamics are, by and large, identical) - But a number of changes to the execution has left it feeling underwhelming compared to its predecessor. The way I see it, if you really enjoyed the first one, this should be fine. Otherwise, tread with caution. For me, it simply came down to the fact that it required more time than it rewarded, and I no longer cared enough about the protagonists or story to see it through to completionWe once again join George and Nico in another escapade to solve mysteries (I'm tempted to hum the Scooby Doo theme tune here) - though George's usual charm seems to be laced with a bit more obnoxiousness here. Him and Lobineau find it more fitting to trade terse ripostes than actually try to find out if Nico is ok. You're then breaking into private land, smashing artefacts and plunging a dog into the ocean... I found George becoming more unlikeable as I went along. The antagonist Karzac and his henchmen aren't particularly interesting either. All in all, the characters felt weaker this time around, and for such a story-driven game, this is a considerable problemThe shark-jump for me, however... was being on the docks and repeatedly having an overweight watchman fart in my face (no, I'm serious) - At that point, the game seemed to move beyond serious plot laced with humour, to just plain silly. It just didn't seem to know whether to take itself seriouslyI'm also not sure on the graphics. The game itself is fine - But the portraits lacked the visual appeal from before, particularly in the speech animations. George in particular had a rather creepy expression (a small grin, from the side) which looks like he intends to watch you inappropriately in your sleepThe one thing Broken Sword 2 DID do, was remove some of the unnecessary dialogue options. So when chatting to people, you at least don't have to potentially click through every item in your inventory, but just the important ones and a handful of funny ones too. The catch is that a lot of the puzzles seem to be lacking too. It fell again to a lot of dialogue. The worst was landing in Quaramonte - Pretty much having to talk to the entire town repeatedly, walking back and forth between screens until I managed to trigger another talking point with another character... who happened to be on the other side of town... it was a very tedious section and I just didn't feel very challenged or engagedIt's a shame. But personally, the plot just wasn't strong enough to carry to slower pace. And likewise, the puzzles weren't exciting or challenging enough to compensate for the weaker storyline			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible story, puzzles were either too easy or too stupid. A lot of attempted storyline development with nothing coming out of it. Everything is realistic until the end, and then it turns out that a magical demon actually shows up and the world is saved by a dwarf. Yeah I spoiled you, but does it matter? Unlike in broken sword 1, where Nico is a well developed and cool character, Nico has been reduced to a ♥♥♥♥♥y girlfriend. I'd give this game a 1/5 stars.

												If you enjoy point and click puzzles with a moving story i would recommend this game. Some puzzles are a little bit too lateral thinking to the point where it makes it a unrealistic but other then that they are fun and consistant. New portraits add character to the game. If you havent played the first one get that before this, a better game in all avenues in my opinion.			",53,20,0,22,5,0,23

												Point and click adventure, good art, full voice, good characters, slightly cheesy writing.  Pleased that Duane and Pearl make a reappearance from Broken Sword 1.  Puzzles occasionally frustrating, a lot of back-and-forth dialogue puzzles where you need to coordinate between NPCs who are across the map from eachother.  The game is cut into discrete level-like segments, so you never need to worry about backtracking to previous areas.  There is a full in-game hint system, which unfortunately sometimes gives you the wrong hint -- telling you to go talk to an NPC, but not telling you what unrelated actions will unlock the dialogue options that you need to continue.An acceptable game, especially with a walkthrough, but not one I'd go far out of my way for.  Buy it on sale.[edit] Made it to the end -- it fell into the cardinal sin of games/movies in this general genre.  It let the magical macguffin overpower all of the human characters bickering over it, a la Indiana Jones 4.  Though one character was redeemed that I did not expect, which was nice.

There's no reason to spend time combing over everything, no need to use any observation skills or even think about anything at all because  everything is nicely highlighted to make it easy.This IS a good game, but do yourself a favour and go emulate the PS1 version without all the pointless crap they have added in this one.

												I played this right after the first one and I was immediately aware of the little changes on the interface and the gameplay and almost all of them are improvements. Yet they are so little that this game doesn't feel like another game at all but that's not really an issue soo moving on. We are still dealing with average P&C mechanics, puzzles, annoyingly slow moving characters like the first one but two main points are pretty much sucks compared to the first one. First is the secondary lead character Nico. They changed her voice actor and the new one is really bad, especially compared to first one. ""Luckily"" you don't hear her voice much because Nico's role in this game and ceratinly as the lead is very little. I don't know what the hell the creators were thinking but that's just wrong. Second biggest mistake they made is the story. All that's going on in this game has little to do with the first game at best. Plus it's not even a good story. Cliche bad guys, escapes, end of the world etc. Why they would choose to start from scratch is beyond me but it's not a wise choice at all.To sum up: This clearly shows rushing after a successful game doesn't bring another success.

												Unless Broken Sword 2 comes bundled in with the Broken Sword Trilogy, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to buy this. It doesn't have the same love and care the original Broken Sword had, the puzzles aren't fun they're almost frustrating and certainly poor.They don't make you THINK, they make you click around everywhere hoping.The artwork isn't as charming, and the voice acting doesn't have same over the top appeal. The story is weak too. This is one of the few games that has honestly sent me to sleep while playing... while streaming... I pay my respects to the 2 people who seemingly sat and watched me play this from start to finish. Whoever you were.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

												Click here for my review for the first Broken Sword 1 game. It has a lot in common with Broken Sword 2, so I won't go into those points again.Besides the plot, not much has changed gameplay wise from Broken Sword 1. Which is a mix of good and badPros+Classic click and point adventure style+Puzzles are not overly challenging+Manual save system (some type of autosave is implemented too)+Environments are drawn nicelyCons+No fast travel between screens by double clicking+Uneven pacing of story+Iffy voice acting and overall quality of voice+Slow character movement+A lot of back and forthI didn't like Broken Sword 2 as much as I did the first game. Some of the puzzles and things to do were illogical. Made it through the game without using any hints though. Towards the end of the game, the jungle paths and last puzzle where you are Nico are clearly padding. Otherwise, a decent 2nd part to the Broken Sword series. 5/10 Average			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was good. The characters are strong once again. It seems like part of the game was cut out towards the end. The last act skips over a lot of crucial plot developments and then abruptly ends. But it's all about the journey, not the destination.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This sequel alas feels like it was rushed out, because the ending feels jarringly unfinished, with seemingly missing animated sequences and some missing plot. The game is great at the beginning but loses its compass once you're in the jungles.  Still a worthy Broken Sword game, but just wish it had the proper polish. 6/10			",217,115,2,36,11,2,15

												Unlike the remastered version of the first game, Broken Sword 2 manages to stay true to the original and isn't altered in any significant way aside from ""talking heads"" that were previously reserved for phone calls but are now present for every piece of dialog and few Easter eggs. The game itself builds upon the original, but it somewhat falters in two points and one of those is arguable; it strays just a tiny bit from mostly logical puzzles of the original and Mayan mythology as the crux of the story may not exactly be everyone's cup of tea compared to more universal Templar mysteries. Also worth noting is the absolutely needlessly dragged out puzzle at the end that has you turning wheels to match symbols. These things still fail at besmirching one of the better P&C adventures out there, though.			",907,390,16,194,90,8,172

												Remastering the classic point and clicks has really taken off and although the real benefits of this are often very slim, this issue of Broken Sword already had more then enough to enjoy its original. Not having to jump through any software compatibility-hoops is a fine excuse to play it again anyway. All the original charm is there and the game lacks any uncharacteristic modern addons (which the first remastered Broken Sword had).Even though the graphics are still slightly dated (just read: vintage), there is a certain cinematic cartonish quality to all the animations and characters have a way of flowing across the scene that is more fluid and natural then most games of those days. Add to this the excellent plot, likeable characters and fun puzzles, this is a true classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my all time favourite adventure games, the music blends the gameplay and setting together perfectly. After all these years the graphics still stand up against modern Point & Click titles, while the story of Broken Sword 2 is not quite as good as the first it more than makes up for it with charm and character.

												This is a nice click and point adventure game, as you play as George and enjoyed the part where you get a guy drunk and he falls over glasses and artifects. The graphics and music are very nice and you feel like moving forward with the story as it is well written and made with great thought. The hint system is good and helps you when you get stuck which I have used a few times as some parts were tricky and a nice way to help new people to the game. I got this game in a bundle with  the first and this one and the third game and was worth it and would recommend this game to anyone.			",33,85,0,6,2,0,2

												George Stobbard has some deep pockets, considering the items he hides inside them, but don't let that frightening thought discourage you from picking up this classic P&C adventure game. Funny, smart, and with few illogical puzzles, this is a great pick up for those looking for some old school adventure fun.The Remastered version of Broken Sword 1 & 2 offer some nice upgrades, and make them a little easier to swallow for modern players.

												Broken Sword 2 is a classic from the Golden Age of adventure games. Its immersive atmosphere, funny, clever puzzles make it a must for everyone who likes old fashioned point 'n' click games. The puzzles are hard but they are never illogical or forced -- thus they can be solved by using only pure logic and Holmesian deduction rather than brute force. 10/10!			",91,23,1,12,29,0,45

												Good game, it continues the story of George and Nico, while they find themselves in another adventure. This time, they travel through Europe, the Caribbean and South America, while trying to avoid that an evil  Mayan god resurfaces and spread terror on earth.This time, the plot was more deep and dark than the first game. Yet, it is a good game, since the user interface and good storyline were kept.Another recommendation for gamers.			",493,219,51,43,29,5,45

												Broken Sword 2 is a great classic point and click adventure.  Is it as good as the first one? Almost... The story isn't quite as tight but the voice acting is solid, the characters are great, the chemistry between George and Nico is back, beautiful, handdrawn graphics yet again and the puzzles are pretty challenging again.  I didn't love how abuptly the ending was - but the ending was decent - just could have sent us off with something more I felt.  Still a must play for any fan of the series or a someone who just enjoys the genre.This game took me about eight hours of game play - I have played through it twice now.			",101,146,2,29,28,0,17

Notice: You should buy Broken Sword 1 & 2 on GoG instead. They come with the original games along with the remasters. Steam version does notBroken Sword 2 takes the formula of the first Broken Sword game and improves it. Everything from story to the characters to the puzzles are improved. Except I don't know why they took out the one feature the first game had where if you clicked on a doorway you instantly switched scenes instead of waiting for the character to walk all the way. It's also slightly shorter which I count as a positive because Broken Sword games never had complex enough stories to deserve being too long and that's where the first game failed in my opinion. It's better than the first game overall.			",352,160,6,56,39,2,46

												If Broken Sword 1 can be considered akin to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", then this is defiantly the ""Temple of Doom"" of the series. Holy crap does this game take a turn for the dark at a later point. Awesome click and point, if you like these games. David Cage could learn a thing or 10549504 from these games!

												A somewhat worthy successor of Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templar. IMHO it lacks both character development and story depth. The game fails to present a more interesting weaving between the game plot and real historical facts such as 17th century piracy and Mayan civilization. Even with these shortcomings it is fun and a must for anyone that enjoyed the first instalment of the series.			",72,27,1,9,3,0,12

												Here we go again George....Once again George is thrown into another epic adventure along with Nico, but is it as capturing as his first?While the sequel is a great game, and trust me it really is, it couldn't quite hit the high marks of it's predecessor. The gameplay is virtually identicle, as in you will talk to people and pick up everythign you can to try and figure out how to proceed over your current obstacle. The graphics have been done in the same way and they still look great.Instead of dealing with a conspiracy this time the story deals with drug trafficing and ancient gods, its a good tale, but I missed the not knowing what was really going on the original had, this time it's advancing much more quickly.George visits Nico in Paris, they visit a professor together, and Nico is abducted while George is tied to a chair in a burning house, with a venomous spider slowly approaching him. Once he escapes its up to George to find Nico and uncover the dangerous work she had begun, which ultimatley once again leads them both all over the world, including France, Mexico, London and the carribean.The remastered version isn't much special really, mainly it is just portraits of faces when people speak, it adds nothing to the main game. In this game Nico is playable too (she wasn't playable in the original version of shadow of the templars) and you will visit different places and uncover different clues. The voicework and art is once again done very well, and has aged the same as the original, which was great.A great sequel to a great game, but cannot really surpass it.Pros-Good story-Good characters-Good voicework-Good PuzzlesCons-Doesnt quite feel as magnificent as the original-Remastered doesn't add much8/10			",190,57,4,33,6,2,12
