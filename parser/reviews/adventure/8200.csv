												This game broke me. It broke my mind. The point where you have to discredit the renaimated statue of Abraham Lincoln by making him read ""cue cards"" and setting him up with a girlfriend... It killed my sanity. And thank god for that, it was really starting to cramp my style. Classic adventure gaming at it's weirdest and funniest.			",319,105,1,70,43,5,76

												Your very traditional point-and-click adventure game with goofy characters, pun-based humor, and passable storylines. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. If you like point-and-click adventure games that are light-hearted and fairly well-polished with your typical point-and-click puzzle elements, then it is hard to go wrong with any Sam & Max game. These are really terrific to throw on a low-powered laptop and play while you're watching television or waiting at the airport or otherwise needing some simple distraction.

												This series is FANTASTIC. I have played the other Telltale Games and even the original Sam & Max, and I adore this series. This first season is the weakest entry in the series, (with Devil's Playhouse contrastly being one of the best adventure games out there), but the series gets better and better with each episode. However, this does have a hard time running on Windows 10, and there is no patch for it from Telltale. If you don't feel like fixing the first two seasons yourself, at least go buy Season 3.From the excellent writing to the likable characters to the award-winning music to the excellent voice acting - including Roger Jackson of Powderpuff Girls and Scream fame - you can't miss this series. I love it, and a potential Season 4 is my most wanted sequel in gaming, (since Psychonauts 2 just got funded). EDIT: There IS a way to easily fix this on your Windows 10 computers! What you need to do is this...(credit to Kong)The following is working for me with Season 2 on Windows 10:Open the files folder for the game on your harddrive.Backup prefs.prop and all .save files.Delete those files from game folder.Run REGEDITGo to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Telltale Games\Sam & Max Season 2Modify Windowed from 0 to 1Run game. It should now be running windowed!I had to play through one episode in a very compressed Windows mode, but by the next I was playing at full screen again!If you want full screen, follow this guide...Step 1 : You need to download and install Notepad++ from the following link:https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/(NOTE - Didn't need to download Notepad, I had it already).Step 2 : Open up your Steam folder, by default it's in 'C:\program files (x86)\steam'. in the Steam folder you must go to '\steamapps\common' and there you must look for the 'sam and max' folders with the season and episode number behind it. Here you must open up the folder of one of the episodes that won't work for you.Step 3 : You might want to copy the 'prefs.prop' to a save place in case you break something in the next steps, but this is not required if you know what you are doing.Step 4 : Open the 'prefs.prop' for the Sam&Max episode that doesn't work for you by right clicking the file and selecting 'Edit with Notepad++' (or edit normally)Step 5 : The file opened will look unreadable at first and you must scroll the bar to the right to find the word 'Windowed' followed by the number 0. You could also use the Search option inside Notepad++ to locate this word. Now you only have to change the 0 to 1 and save the file. (In case there is no 'Windowed' in the file, rightclick the game in the library within Steam go to 'Properties', and then click on 'SET LAUNCH OPTIONS...' and enter -sw. Launch the game once, it will crash but the 'prefs.prop' should be altered and have 'Windowed0' in it again after opening it with Notepad++. after this remove the -sw from the launch options)Step 6 : Start the game, this is to check if the game runs in Windowed mode like it should. You can change the resolution to what you like, but never ever click the fullscreen option again or you will have to edit the 'prefs.prop' file once again.Now we can make the game run in Fullscreen using Borderless GamingStep 7 : Install Borderless Gaming and start it (after you bought it offcourse). After that go to 'Options' and make sure it starts every time you start Windows by checking 'Run On Windows Startup'. You could also go to 'Tools' and click 'Disable Steam Hook' to make sure Steam won't tell you are in-App Bordelless Gaming all the time each time Borderless Gaming is launched.Step 8 : Start Sam&Max in Windowed mode and in under the Applications window in Borderless Gaming you will see 'Telltale Games' appear. Click on that and then followed by the arrow pointing to the right so 'Telltale Games' will be visible under 'Favourites (automatic)'. Rightclick 'Telltale Games' in here and make sure that 'Fullscreen' and 'Auto-Maximize' are checked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're not sure whether you'd enjoy a point and click adventure game, Sam & Max provides the style and humor to carry you over til you know for sure whether you just hate the gameplay. Personally, I'd play it even if I despised adventures because of the characters and humor. Zany and sometimes not safe for kids is right up my alley. 4/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												(Review counted as the Complete Sam and Max Seasons 1,2 and 3 HOWEVER seasons 1 and 2 currently do not work on Windows 10)Really entertaining and funny point and click adventure game. Though I admit I am a bit dumb when it came to puzzles in this game...often ended up looking up guides >w>  SHHHHH! In all honesty the puzzles (basicly everything you do in the game) are all well thought out so there isn't any super unrealistic answer to a problem that hasn't been hinted slightly in the game....Like pixel searching or using items together in a way that makes no sense to solve a problem.Get it if you love point and click adventure games because this is as good as it gets!! ^.^ As long as you dont mind 15 games appearing in your games library after only buying 3.....

												A genuinely funny  and well written point and click game. The episodic nature makes it great for casual gamers, while the continuity between episodes makes and setting diversity makes playing all the episodes in one sitting a great experience.  The only problem I ever had with it was that once in a while even when I knew what to do it was difficult to get the sequence of events in just the right order to work out.  Overall 10/10 If this doesn't make you laugh nothing will.			",412,76,13,45,33,4,41

												Sam and Max: Season one is your standard point-and-click adventure game using Steve Purcell's classic characters from the original 1987 comic. TellTale expands their universe in a 6 episode season premiere that will create a fun and interesting story. The voice acting is fantastic, the puns are plenty and the puzzles are, errrr...well...puzzling at times! It should be noted that season one does not support widescreen resolutions.

												Great series, great humour... if you're into that kinda oddball, quirky stuff. The controls are a bit awkward at times, and I had to use a walkthrough to get past a few ridiculous puzzles, but I had loads of fun. Really loved the various characters in each episode. You don't need to be a fan of the comic or television series to appreciate them. Each episode takes roughly 2 hours to finish and they're all quite different from the last, especially Reality 2.0. Probably best to wait for a big sale to get the complete pack.			",824,301,26,81,66,10,105

AUDIOHilariousVISUALCheapDIFFICULTYModerateVIBEHumorousCRAVINGPoint & ClickON SALEOften BundledPROS: Pretty funny series, if a little cheesy. Fragmented episodes means each story can get plenty of attention without audio and voices being overly recycled. Laugh-out-loud musical numbers. The world changes as you progress through the episodes, so there are always new details to find. I appreciate the episodic approach in this so there were no temptations to recycle dialogue.CONS: The game does not like widescreen monitors. I had to restart my computer from the crashing twice before finding a way to get the episodes to boot in an undestructive fashion. This season was also extremely easy and offered very little challenge to neither a new point and click player nor a seasoned one.WORTH: Season 1 and Season 2 are always in awesome bundle deals, so waiting for a sale would be an advantageous move.OVERALL: Despite being absolutely no challenge, there's something to be said about a game that can make you laugh this much with such hokey humor. For some reason, the Sam & Max hasn't been dated as I expected. This duo is a lovable spin on the Good Cop, Bad Cop shtick, with both character being surprisingly complex for what seems to be a one-dimensional comedy series. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good laugh or is new to the genre.SCORE:9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon ",309,150,6,54,38,3,41

												Warning: This is NOT a game with QTEs, where you walk around to solve easy ""puzzles"" and make important decisions like the recent Telltale games. This is a classic, 90's-stlye point-and-click game with medium to hard puzzles and dialogues are only important to solve the puzzles,  (the story is quite linear).Tip: you need the Telltale Custom Resolution Tool to play the game in the reoslution you want (you cannot select modern monitor resolutions in the game): http://www.wsgf.org/book/export/html/5159I played the original (2D) Sam & Max game a long time ago, and it was a lot of fun. This 3D return is not the same thing, but if you enjoy Point and Click games and don't mind, when stuck, to check a walkthrough, you'll have a lot of fun. The plot is ridiculous but fun, and the dialogues are quite entertaining, as alll characters are well designed.Thumbs up from me!			",1177,714,10,98,37,5,64

They have such a great sense of humor that'll keep you laughing until you finish them (I've finished the first 2 seasons on Xbox 360 years ago, don't let my low hours fool you). Sam & Max is probably the quirkiest telltale series and my favorite of theirs. If you like solving puzzles, interesting characters and witty humor, then give this game a try!			",102,34,3,4,4,2,6

												Sam & Max: Season One is made of 6 point'n'click adventure games, connected by the plot of hypnosis.It's one of the first games to use episodic model of releases. And unlike many others, it used them with success, making TellTale produce more adventure games in similiar fashion. It also seems to be one of few games to be on Steam before it was cool.Oh, and it doesn't support widescreen. Sorry folks, 2007 year and all.Episodic model is also used in good and bad way, in a sense that you have common location and few common characters (outside of those that are unique to single episode) that keep reappearing in each episode. Sybil is most amusing, as she changes job every single episode. Such familiarity works nicely. But then, there are some negativity about it too, like, in the last episode you can suddenly pick up object that main hero refused to keep in all previous episodes.Graphics and music have style to them, even though they are a bit weak. Both of them. Well, or not so weak.Fine, music is nice, but more of staying in the background. And graphics are fine for cartoonish style. Lacks some good shadows though. But hey, was designed for low-end machines back then.It's quite usual old-schoolish point'n'click by gameplay and plot, following same mindset of ""puzzles are the main point"". Which isn't bad thing. Combined with expected humorous approach. Mature one even. You do get few hard puzzles that I am sure you would want to use at least some hints from the almighty Google. But at least you feel clever when solving some of harder ones, at least I did, when figured out Checksum puzzle.Did I mentioned humour?Actually, characters interaction and humour is one of the best in when it comes to ""old-school by being linear and humor-based"", outdoing most of older titles.It's a pretty nine series. Some may like it, some may not. Others will choke on rainbow bliss. From smiling too much.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												As of now I have only completed the first episode of Sam & Max season 1 which is Culture Shock and I enjoyed it! At first I thought a point and click game would be boring, but as I started playing this game I found that it was actually very fun. Sam and Max is a great game to play when you want to play a casual, fun, humourous game. It has clearly defined characters and diaolgue that made me chuckle more than a few times. One of my favourite character's is Bosco of Bosco Inconvenients, his overprotectiveness and the funny conversations he had with Sam and Max made me laugh! I recommend Sam and Max for players who like a bit of singleplayer, casual fun!			",63,26,2,1,3,3,11

												DO NOT BUY IF PLANNING ON USING IT ON A WINDOWS 10 SYSTEM. Unfortunately I had glosed over it as I had been pining after the Sam and Max games for ages and when I saw them on sale jumped for my purse. I have only recently joined Steam, haven't spent my entire life purely confined to the worlds of playstation and after a few other games working perfectly, I did not research this game enough to realise buying it would be erroneous (especially as I had always been impressed by TellTale games). As I'm pretty much a n00b when it comes to computer gaming, it's going to take forever to figure out how to play these games, if they even will work at all.Completely blank white screen upon running of the game. The figure for gameplay time is completely misleading as I have not yet reached a title screen, let alone any gamplay. The 0.6 hours is made up of trying to start up the game dozens of times after installing things and following guides, all that haven't worked yet.			",6,19,0,1,1,0,0

												Sam and Max is a moderately funny click adventure game that features a bunny and a dog as detective. The puzzles are simplistic, the humor is simplistic. If you are looking for profound dialogue and/or puzzles, you will not be finding it in season one.I was not too surprised to find out that Sam and Max, like most other click adventures, have no re-playability. However, I was surprised to find how dull episode 1,2,3 is in this series. The three episodes are chock full of simple fedex delivery puzzles with esoteric solutions. Good luck solving them without a walk-through. Luckily the game does pick up it’s pace by episode 4, and the game took a turn for the best. Puzzles solutions remain esoteric, but the results of solving the puzzles can create quite amusing consequences. You also will not remain stuck at your boring♥♥♥♥♥apartment block which is a plus!Telltale nailed the voice acting in this series. Intentionally annoying characters have intentionally annoying voices; you will feel like punching the screen every single time the soda poppers talk. Humor is not universal, so the jokes in this game can either strike you as “ROFL” quality or downright immature. Luckily none of the jokes are nearly as stupid or overused as the ones you find in Duke Nukem Forever.I recommend this game solely on the basis that’s a very well polished click adventure with a unique brand of humor. It’s not immersive or challenging, but it does make for a fantastic change of pace in between long sessions of Elder Scrolls, Counter Strike, DOTA 2, etc.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												I do love Sam and Max series and I strongly recommend them to anyone who like Adventure games.However, season 1 episodes are poorly compatible with Windows 10 and do not support widesceen. Although Windows 10 compatibility issue can be manually fixable (see discussion page), I believe Telltale should addresses these issues especially allowing the game to run in Window Mode by default since it was never made for widescreens.Anyway, this episode is my least favourite which is mainly why I voted Not Recommend. The Poppers characters are extremely annoying.			",156,39,1,21,16,1,9

												This review is for all seasons of the Sam & Max video game series:Being a avid cartoon fan, I would've expected something as breakneck fast and energetic as the show. What we got from one of Taletale's earlier games is a bunch of moments that feel like Sam & Max after a long day of freelance crime-solving, and it's in 3D instead of Steve Purcell's lovely hand-drawn art style.The writing is fairly funny, but most of the experience just feels flat or shallow - probably better off buying the complete series on DVD rather than playing a game based off of it. Plus, Sam's new voice is annoying to listen to compared to the original voice actor Harvey Atkin - shame they couldn't get him for these games.Still, even if the game, the acting, the puzzles, and the story doesn't always seem appealing, it's an enjoyable, quirky Point & Click adventure to blaze through.The good news is that the writing improves slightly each season as well as the graphics. It's also amusing to see the same location altered due to the events of past game episodes as well as deviate to some new ones connected to the game's Main st.7/10: worth one playthrough, not much else.

I've had many laughs and really enjoyed playing this. This is by far one of the best point & click games I've ever played.

												This is a hell of a fun series. This was the first season of the Sam & Max games and what I loved was that this brought Telltale Games into the limelight. It also brought back the much loved duo who hadn't been in a game since their old classis ""Sam & Max hit the road"" so I am so damn glad this was made.I origonally bought all the seasons off the Telltale website before they were made available on steam. What I love most about these games is they keep the humor, bring in new characters and they even have the origonal creator on standby to help with the development which I loved! Not to mention, the final villain is always a difficult one to discover.I believe that this was the series that put TellTale on the map and the fact that they even had the creator on board to help them with the game (much like how they had Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future) certainly made sure that they have become such a massive indy company now.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												Don't you just love it when they bring older games available on Steam and don't bother to patch them so that they work normally by just starting the game? Not even when the community has addressed the problem to developers and Valve (many cases can be found by googling). And these are not even that old games!Luckily the solution to get these Sam & Max games to work is simple this time: just set your screen resolution to 1028x960 or lower and the game launches fine to full screen. You can also try to be fast with Alt+Enter (to put the game in windowed mode) when you launch the game, but I found out that some of the objects and backgrounds weren't showing up properly this way.Telltale's Sam & Max games themselves are simplified classic point-n-click adventure games and I do recommended them for their humour and easy-going gameflow.

												Sam and Max Season One was a great way to start of the series of course they graphic aren't up to date but then again this was released in 2007 so what can we expect the comedy is great,sarcastic,ironic,and a whole lot of fun the downsides are that there are some minor bugs and come in seperate games you have to download another thing was  that the walking is slow so getting to point a to point b and may get repetetive was but in the end the humor is good and story was interesting for people who like point and click and who are patient definitly get this game but if your a casual game play then i would recomend something like monkey island for people who dont really enjoy games like this more something like COD or CSGO then i still recomend this game because this game is hilarious and makes you enjoy it to its ful extent  but for me personally i enjoyed this game so much i give it a 9/10 because there are some bugs and kind of repetetive(barely) and and get kinda confusing I understand this is not a AAA(triple A title) but there is some repetetiveness and  trust me that repetetive parts in this game is VERY ANNOYING that so therefore it is a 9/10.

												Althrough gameplay wise it's your basic point-and-click adventure game, Sam & Max completley makes up for it with great writing, challenging puzzels, and of course hilarious dialogue between our main characters and the rest of the off-reality universe they live in. However I would recommend you buy the complete pack to truly get your money's worth, as I only bought Season 1 when it was on sale.			",42,5,0,2,5,0,1

												Sam & Max: Season One is an episodic point and click adventure game series that adapts the classic comic series into a game.  Unsurprisingly, this is a fantastic means to adapt the comic, as nothing suits the series inane and black comedy humor so well.  The first season has plenty to do and see.  While there's nonexistent consequences for making a wrong choice, it's still pretty great to see all of the seperate choices and the dialogue as a result. PROS: Fantastic adaption of the comic series. Lots of well written dialogue and jokes with some references to the original series Original story line 6 Episodes, all about 2-3 hours apiece, so about at least 12 hours total, depending on how fast you solve the puzzles.CONS: Each episode requires seperate settings, so you'll have to change them upon starting up. Sam walks everywhere, which can be annoying at times (this is fixed in the second season) Like with any starting series, the first episode is perhaps the most flat, with the voice acting for the title characters being weirdly flat and unlike the characters. Things thankfully get under way following the next episode and from there things go off the rails as a good Sam and Max series should. Like most adventure games, the logic can be weird at times, with some solutions requiring things you didn't know you can use.  (So i suggest keeping EVERYTHING that you can comment on in mind).  This is of course debatable since most people can probably solve it faster than others. Each episode is technically a standalone game, so you're gonna have a lot of titles in your library if you install them all.I got the entire three seasons for 10 bucks, so i can't say whether or not it's worth it for regular price.  I can say it's worth getting if you enjoy black comedy or are a fan of the series.  Very recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Sam & Max game series and I always have fun playing it. It's funny, creative, has a nice art style, and has a cast of characters that I enjoy(except for the Soda Poppers, they're so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying they make me want to jab forks into my ears and scrape out my eardrums). It's one of TellTale's first games so it doesn't have the same quality writing that the newer ones such as TFTBL or TWAU have, but it's still pretty enjoyable and charming for what it is. For some reason, however, I'm having trouble playing this particular episode(I can play Season 3, though, and I haven't tried playing Season 2 yet but I'm sure it has the same problem). I'm guessing it's because I have Windows 10, so it'd be nice if this game could be updated because I have no idea how to fix this problem. I'm not too frustrated because I bought this game with the Sam & Max Complete Pack while it was on sale so it's not like I threw away too much money, but I'm still a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I love this game. This series is one of my favorites from TellTale, but I just can't recommend it right now until this problem gets fixed. If it weren't for this one compatibility issue, I'd say it's worth the money if you're into silly cartoonish games just for the fun of it.			",17,10,0,0,1,2,0

												Most people who have a game from this series have Sam & Max: The Devil’s Playhouse - from bundle site sales. But a good number do not have the season 1 or 2. This is another telltale game. So it's a point and click adventure  (for all you call of duty fanboys out there, there's very limited shooting involved in this game). This game is fun to play through I did all the parts in one go as Freelance Police - Sam and Max make their way to determine who is the mastermind behind all the hypnotism of people of earth. In order to do so you must become a TV star, defeat Abe Lincoln, become President of the United States, spend $1 trillion dollars on special items - that is a lot to do and so little time before the planet earth become victims of always being happy and optimistic (OOOHHH NO!!!)Another telltale game worth playing through :D			",4087,1648,167,500,613,58,644

												If you've played Back to the Future: The Game, Strong Bad's Cool Game For Attractive People, or Tales of Monkey Island, then you'll be familiar with Telltale's episodic structuring of their games.  Each episode seems to be isolated story-wise at first, but they do interconnect, and have consequences in Seasons 2 & 3.  I love visiting Bosco's Inconvience and Sybil Pandemik's office every episode, seeing what's new, dealing with Max's sociopathic attitude, and talking with the cheerful but mysterious Hugh Bliss, pushing his Prismatology cult.  Point-and-click adventure fans will love this season, and the rest too.			",154,57,9,24,14,0,24

												First off, if you have windows 10 then you will have problems running the game.I would have to say the game itself was definitely a shock and not in a good way. I apparently am not a huge fan of the Sam & Max humor. I found most of the game rather boring and not funny. The game felt like it was meant for a little kid as the story is extremely stupid. I regret buying this game and other telltale products, as Tales of Monkey Island was the only one with a decent story and humor.Pros:...Cons:Short Game (wait for this game that is a pro)Terrible StorylineLimited Area of TravelNot FunnySoda Poppers made me want to rip my hair out			",10,38,0,0,1,0,1

												I played the entire season before writing this.  It's very funny and the dialogue is excellent.  It's one of the newer point-and-click adventure series, though it's actually one of Telltale's older games because it was made during 2006-2007.  However, I see it as ""newer"" because it's broken up into smaller chunks and doesn't require you to pick up that many objects.  Older adventure games usually pack your inventory with all kinds of things and some serve no purpose in solving the puzzles.  Like many other Telltale games it's split into episodes, so I will summarize what I think of each one:Episode 1:  It introduces you to the characters and emphasizes the hypnosis theme which is prevalent in all the episodes but especially in this one.  The Soda Poppers are funny but a little creepy, and the main enemy is pretty silly.  I liked this episode alright but it's not the best one.  Episode 2:  You again deal with a hypnotized person, but before that you have to succeed in a variety of TV shows.  This is is one of the funniest episodes and I highly recommend it, especially since you don't have to go back and forth between areas quite as much. Episode 3:  Funny if you like Chuck E Cheese parodies, but ultimately I didn't like the main enemy in this one.  I didn't get a sense of what I needed to do in this episode quite as much. Episode 4:  Well, if you ever wanted to meet Abe Lincoln here is your chance.  This episode makes pokes fun at the American government a lot and the best part involves a campaign speech you have to sabotage.  It's one of my favorites for sure.  Episode 5:  This one has a lot of old-school video game references so I found it very amusing.  The main enemy reminds me of SHODAN slightly and the colorful environments are quite attractive.  This is probably my second-favorite episode next to Episode 2. Episode 6:  You finally find out who is behind all the hypnosis issues and well, it's not particularly surprising.  It's a trippy episode and fun if you hate silly New Age philosophy cults.  Overall it's a pretty hilarious adventure game, though it doesn't offer the challenge that the older adventure games did.  Also, this game is quite old now and the 3d graphics are somewhat underwhelming.  Even so, this is a good place to start if you are curious about Sam & Max and want to play a comedy game.

												It comes with 5 episodes, each one will end up taking you between 2-4 hours (just over 2 for me was the average and about 3.5 was the max). This is one of very few puzzle games I'd say it's acceptable to use a guide for.In terms of gameplay, it's a point and click adventure game with a wonderful sense of humor. Even if you aren't into point and click adventure games, it's worth buying on sale just to listen to the dialogue.In addition to that, I'm still playing on Windows 7, and there have been quite a few reported problems with the Windows 10 version, so before buying look up to see if there are any fixes for it available.

												Remember how dumb adventure games could be? What if you could harness that stupidity for the force of good... or at least entertainment? Well, Telltale did, cured Morgellons, and used the leftover juice to revive one of the greatest properties in gaming history, the Freelance Police.Grab yourself a whatever and ""RELAX!"" with Sam and Max as they try to deal with the obviously contrived bulldada that comprise all point-and-click adventure games. You'll encounter caricatures of people, places and ideologies you well know and abide, the clutter of random objects required for needlessly obtuse puzzles, and many other Boscotech™ innovations.

												I didn't know what to expect for this game. All I knew is that it was made using the Telltale Tool and I really enjoy the games that use that as an engine. That said, I LIKED this game... I didn't love it, but I did really like it. The ending was a little ""short"" or ""anti-climatic"" and that might be because I had to use a guide for half of the game, you really have to think like the main characters. But I really liked the dark humor that this game season is, I love the jokes, I still listen to the music on loop, (there are musical numbers!) and I am surly going to play the next season. If you like Film Noir and games that poke fun at Music, Games, Politics, and Cults... You will enjoy this game.			",84,69,4,18,9,1,13

												First thing, off the bat.  Sam & Max is great.  They've ALWAYS been great.  Since the BEFORE TIME (pre-interwebs.)There's a very old definition of ""(graphic) adventure game"", also from the BEFORE TIME, that revolved around millions of items and dozens of commands and long hours of trying everything on everything.THIS GAME IS NOT THAT.This whole Telltale thing, Sam & Max Save the World (Season One) is a phenomenally produced game whose play isn't so brain bending annoying, and the humor and story is absolutely stupendous.  It's more like experiencing an animated comic book.  The set story and path to completion obviously hurts replay value, but this is a game that does not need it; same as the words in your favorite book not changing or the scenes in your favorite movie, one playthrough justifies all time and money spent.

												I bought this game (starting with season 1) because i remember playing S&M first on floppy disks, then eventually on CD-ROM with Sam & Max: Hit the Road. I loved those games, and they are some of my favorites from that era of gaming. These games completely live up to that sense of adventure and whimsey. Never have i played a reboot of a series that so accurately captured the look and feel of the original, while adding new content to the series. If you were a fan of the games, or at least the point&click genre, from that time.. do yourself and favor and pick up this game. Also, i am a Windows 10 Pro x64 user, and have had no troubles running the game. Not sure what others' issues are, but i put the game's executable in compatibility mode with Vista and everything runs as smooth as hot butter running down Max's supple, yet firm, back.

												This was a nice change to play from what Telltale puts out these days. Their old games focus more on a linear story, point and click adventure. Rather than having choices that changes the outcome of the game. The challenge here is to gather things and use logic(most of the time…) to find out what items and dialogue triggers what. and you have to do a lot or going back and forth between locations in the game.I had to resort to guides online multiple times, at first I thought I was getting stupid, but then I realized I’ve gotten spoiled by newer games. In the end it kinda took me back, and I rather enjoyed playing through it.I had NO knowledge or prior experience with Sam & Max apart from the Poker games from Telltale, so the terrible jokes(which I like…), references and the way they solve crime blew me away. Not recommended if you are after a “immersive and realistic” type of game.As for the technical aspect, this is an old game. The engine is outdated and only supports 3 resolutions(at least it did for me, 1024x768 was the highest it would go), this game also ran at 40-50fps max. But it was nothing I really didn’t expect from a game this old, it still played nicely. But if you are running Windows 10 however, it seems like you aren’t gonna be able to play. The support section is filled with those complaints.So all in all, a fun game series which takes me back, is packed with terrible jokes and references. And doesn’t cost much compared to what you get out of it.(If you aren’t on Win10 that is, then don’t bother…) So I recommend it a lot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sam & Max is an interactive game about, well Sam & Max a silly freelance policeman, as you play as Sam and witness they're shenanigans while supposedly doing a police work.Let's go to the Options in game:This game is pretty old, so don't expect very artistic or incredible graphics. You can switch between Low and High settings for the graphicsYou're stuck in 4:3 aspect ratio which mean you'll be playing in square.. view and which also mean the resolution in game only offer you some square resolution (maximum resolution 1280x960).Sound was okay you could tweak three option provided which is Music, Voices, and Sound Effect. Though I don't see why would you want to tweak the settings of this pretty old game.And next is the Gameplay:Gameplay is pretty simple, there's not much control but that's fine since the game doesn't do much except telling you story and interact with stuff.Now apparently this game doesn't remind you what to do exactly by using like some quest pointer or so, so you wouldn't exactly know what to do, but not to worry because the game will provide you with some sort of hint on what to do which can be earn by talking to characters or interacting with something by using something (well most of the time)While in the game they gonna do some cartoonish action so expect cartoon level jokes, which is pretty funny (at least to me).Verdict:While this may looks obvious already but the game is for kids (or so I think) in which case it doesn't have to be taken too seriously. The game is suitable for everyone. The game is about humour and fun so I say it again, don't take it too seriously, by this I mean like start ranting randomly like ""The graphic is bad! blablabla"".The game doesn't provide a good replay value sadly (at least for me), but that doesn't mean you could not replay it. And still have a small laugh with itI recommend this for everyone who likes cartoon and don't mind spending some money on a small time entertainmentI strongly recommend this to anyone who have younger relatives (like little kids, or preschooler level or so) and let them play in his/her computer, because apparently his/her computer have games on it and quite many kids want to play on the computer			",70,14,0,7,1,0,0
