												I must say this is the most unique and engrossing games I have played in quite some time. The game forces you to slow down and look for clues in order to solve the array of mysteries that you undertake. Having a keen eye and a good memory is imperative to cracking the case. The interrogations are truly the most gripping part of the game; nothing is more exciting than getting a confession after spending hours unearthing clues, following leads, interviewing witnesses and chasing suspects.Team Bondi has changed the face of video games with L.A. Noire. The facial expressions in this game are unrivaled by anything currently out there, and they're not just used during cut-scenes, it's in effect at all time during the game; a level of dedication most becoming of a Rockstar Game. They're so good in fact that you're left wanting the rest of the world to be on par. I'm not saying that it looks bad but it is missing minor polish seen in other Rockstar games (I understand it's a Bondi game...) like limited damage on the cars, bullet holes are missing when a car or person is shot... and that's it. That's all the nitpicking I can pull off.Gunplay isn't as sharp as Grand Theft Auto and takes a little getting used to but it feels right for this type of game and works just fine. The focus isn't wholesale gunfights, rather poignant, key engagements that mean something; you are an officer of the law after all.Give this game a shot if you like cop dramas, film noires, GTA, tacos, fresh and unique gaming experiences.

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:L.A. Noire is an open world neo-noire police / detective game made by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It features crime scene investigation, interrogations, arrests, and possibly, for the first time in the Rockstar games portfolio, police chases where the player is the police.If you like movies such as L.A. Confidential (specially this one), Chinatown and The Untouchables, you'll definitely might want to give this game a try.PROS:+ Facial Animation: -The selling point of L.A. Noire is possibly the facial motion capture technology that was employed. It is this technique that makes the game's interrogations as close to realism as possible for the 'truth / doubt / lie' mechanic to work.+ Atmosphere: -The devs have done remarkable work recreating the wonderful city of 1947 Los Angeles. Although it may not be exactly how it was back then, it's still a large and magnificent city to explore. From the cars, the clothing, the buildings and the radio, Team Bondi certainly nailed the 1947 atmosphere.+ Investigation: -From examining clues to following leads, LA Noire delivers a great police / detective mechanic that provides fun and exciting experience.+ Sound: -Great voice acting, great selection of 1940s classic hits, a bit of radio news from that time, good sound effects and some very classical OST vibe. The voice acting makes for some very memorable characters with unique personalities.+ Playtime: -The game is extensive and will require some time to finish. From the main story, DLC cases, Street Crimes and Collectibles, there are a lot of things to do which is more than enough to make you feel that your money was well spent.CONS:- 30 FPS: -According to the devs, the reason for this was that the motion-capture technology would not function properly if it was not locked at 30 FPS. Be that as it may, most PC gamers would still expect certain games to run at 60fps minimum.- Awkward Body Movements: -I kinda feel they focused a bit too much on the facial animation and severely under developed the body animation. Most character movements are awkward and the bodies seem to move like they were made from cardboard or cement.-  No reward for Non-Lethal Arrest: -The game has optional 'Street Crimes' which can be solved by lethal or non-lethal methods (depending on the Crime). Unfortunately, there is no reward in trying to chase down a fleeing suspect and it would be much easier just to shoot them in the back. This disappointed me a lot.CONCLUSION:GOOD GAME for a GOOD PRICE. L.A. Noire captures the classical 1940-70 police / detective movies that once graced the silver screens but with a bit of modern sprinkles to it. WORTH IT?:Sale or full price, this game is worth every penny.I suggest that potential buyers of this game purchase the 'Complete' Edition which includes the DLCs because they extend the gameplay by providing additional 'Cases' for each of the game's chapters.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												L.A. Noire is a detective game, simple as that. If you're looking for another shoot everything rampage game like GTA just because this game is made by Rockstar then this is not the game for you. Sure there is shooting, but you won't be allowed to kill everyone in sight, running people over will affect your case rating etc. The Atmosphere	  Personally, I love the setting of the game, the late 40s jazz theme mixed with golden age Hollywood as well as a classic noir feel makes for a great mix, but while the storytelling is good, it's not all there. The story feels a bit like it's jumping around without finishing everything off, Rockstar gathered enough story for a movie, but not a 20 hour game. Because of this you will be left with extra things that feel like they are just there to fill up an hour of your time and parts of the story that are never properly concluded. This being said, the story has some great parts towards the second half of the game and does a great job 80% of the time, however the ending will feel incomplete.  Gameplay and Fun	 It's fun to drive around and using your siren to move people out of the way is great. The car chases are exciting at first but end up being repetitive, as with all the chases. Shootouts feel this way too and there are one or two that will feel boring. The combat tends to feel stiff from time to time. For an open world game it is very linear and the free roam mode itself actually takes some working out to access. Street crimes are fun to attend to and interrogations are challeging. The clue finding in the game is brilliant and walking around the crime scenes never gets old although you will quickly work out the set structure to finding all the clues. Sound	 The sound in the game makes for great immersion, no complaints here really. The hint sounds at crime sounds can be turned off if they make the game too easy and the whole feel of the sirens and the radio really sells the 40s atmosphere. Graphics	 The facial expressions are the best part about the graphics, I didn't notice too many hiccups in the graphics and if I did they didn't distract from the game. The faces of people look incredibly lifelike and all the other graphics are good too. The sunny setting of Los Angeles adds a bright feeling to the game. Replayability	 While you do have the option to replay your cases to get all clues and perfect your interrogation this game is likely to be one you will only play the story of once, it's still fun to drive around and do street crimes but the cases tend to be something that's best as a one time thing. Verdict	 Overall this game is great fun and a nice step away from GTA while still keeping to the Rockstart format. It feels fresh but also familiar. The graphics look very good for a game that came out in 2011. You will feel very immersed in the time period through use of sound and surroundings. The open world side has something to be desired and Los Angeles doesn't exactly feel as alive as GTA 4's Liberty City or Watch Dog's Chicago, it doesn't have much of a personality, the characters do. If you're looking for a good open world game, this isn't it, if you're looking for a good story with a mix of puzzle and regular shoot/drive gameplay and well designed characters then this is it. Get this if: You like a good story You want diverse gameplay that makes you think You like the Noir settingDon't get this if: You want full freedom in an open world You want to go on a killing spree You don't care about story  8.5/10	  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Behind the not so good PC port there's a very high quality game, with fun gameplay, story and amazing character face animations. All the characters were portrayed by actual actors (including random NPCs), with high quality acting. The overall atmosphere is fantastic as well, making you feel like a detective while driving around L.A. set in 40's, searching for clues and interrogating people. It starts off slow, but the story gets really interesting once you get to the Arson Department. If you like detective games, shows and movies - do yourself a favor and pick this game up.

One case closing open's another case. The game is so well made, and I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes a good detection and mystery game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In GTA, you commit crimes and the police catches you for it.In LA Noire, it's the other way around. You're the one who catches those who commit crimes.If you love shooting people, crashing vehicles or fighting the police, then this ain't the game for you. Go buy GTA instead.This game is set on a fictional LA 1940s. It gave a different vibe when traveling in the open world.The detective stuff like finding clues or asking suspects questions were good, though they could've done better, but is IS a 2011 game. Many have changed in the gameplay of games through the years.I kinda understand why the gunplay is kinda clunky or kinda basic because maybe they focused mainly on solving cases. It's just my opinion though, but it's still fun.A very unique game. would recommend			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have enjoyed this tremendously. This is probably the most expensive adventure game ever created, only without the point-and-click, of course. But you will be going from location to another location and looking for clues.You will scoff at the locked 30 fps and you'll be baffled at the confusing interrogations, however the atmosphere and the authenticity of this game is a marvellous feat. Los Angeles depicted in the late 40s is only a backdrop, but it plays its role well.Playing L.A. Noire was like watching a really great TV series – each case is around an hour and a half long, and they all tell a different story. If this were a film, it would be quite bland probably, but this is game, and with interactivity it comes to life. Also I have to say the face capture technology is not a gimmick but an integral part of gameplay, and I cannot wait for the next game by Team Bondi and Mr. McNamara.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is not for everyone, it's linear, you gotta make the right decisions or most of the time you'll see a game over screen.But for those who, like me, are into detective whodunit type of stories this game is for you.There's content here for all tastes in crime: traffic, vice, arson and the Homicide desk, which is the best IMO.The driving feels a bit stiff, but nothing that will bother you too much, since you can have your partner drive you places if you don't feel like spending time behind the wheel and want to get straight to business.There is quite some replay value if you want to discover all clues, get all the film reels, cars etc..*The producers really put some hard work in bringing 1947 Los Angeles back, the city is beautiful and feels alive, like every person walking the streets has a story to tell, the attention to detail in this game is amazing, its a pity that so many areas of the city are left out of the main story.Needless to say I recommend this game for those who are interested in deep narrative and focus on story rather than just mindless action.

												This is one of the best detective games I've ever played. L.A Noire is also very underrated compared to other games from Rockstar Games. Only problem with this game is the PC-port. The resolution was a little strange on my computer and unfortunately the game is locked at 30 fps. That basically means that it runs and looks  like the console version. I would actually recommend an xbox 360 controller to get the best experience.You play as Cole Phelps, a police officer. As the story goes you get higher and higher rank. You move up from a police officer to Arson Desk, Vice Desk and so on. You solve big murder cases by finding clues and interview witnesses. The story is good and comes with a plot twist and a surprising ending. The notable thing about L.A Noire is the Motion Scan though. It is a really cool technique where you use multiple cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. It looks so real, and I wish more games would use this. In L.A Noire they used 32 cameras just for the face.The biggest problem with the FPS-cap is when you're driving. The driving feels slow and laggy. However, the framerate wasn't a problem when I investigated things, and that's what you will do the most. You can have your partner drive to almost all locations (like a fast travel) which is great and prevents the problem. So if you're thinking about buying this game for the driving then I would say no, buy GTA instead. If you want a good action adventure crime game, then this is for you.It's tough to decide whether I should recommend this game or not. It's such a great concept with good gameplay, superb voice acting and Motion Scan, but the PC-port is far from good. I think LA Noire is too good to miss out on just based on the port though, so I would say i recommend it. Pick it up on sale and you shouldn't regret it. I got 45 hours of enjoyment just from the story, and I still have many side activites to do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are games you know when you play that there hasn't been any real work put into it and most of the budget went into marketing. But there are some games that when you play, you KNOW that the sheer amount of creativity put into it and the expenses made to craft the experience and make a world has paid off.And then there's LA Noire.This game sets a new standard for the storytelling experience in games, not only with it's technology, but with it's excellent integration of good gameplay mechanics and using that as a way to unravel for yourself the world and it's mysteries.The gameplay involved in solving the cases is pretty solid, with you scouting for clues that will later be used in interrogations. Though the clue-hunting is little more than a game of click-everywhere-until-something-happens, the meat is in the driving sequences and the interrogations. The driving sequences make full use of the fact that there's a big open world out there and anything could happen. Simply driving from one place to another is a nice experience as you see in full glory the love and patience with which Team Bondi recreated 1940s LA. Of course these can be skipped but you'll be missing out on the side missions which dot the city from time to time and can only be discovered if you take over the wheels.But the true flavor comes from the interrogations. They used this technology masterfully in order to not only make the interrogations engaging, but also accessible with some exaggerations on the part of the actors which was done on purpose knowing full well the limitations this technology could have. Simply reading the expressions isn't enough since you also have to back up your accusations with evidence. This requires some thought and patience on your part and you need to read the descriptions of each clue carefully before using them. Suffice it to say that the game is worth it for these sequences and there are a LOT of them.The story too is quite excellent with many noire elements, plot twists and an overarching conspiracy. LA Confidential, the 1997 movie set in around the same time, was a considerable influence for the game.There are a few negatives though. Some cases felt like I wasn't really solving them. Even though ALL the cases have definitive culprits, there were a couple of cases where I felt I was simply going through the motions. The shooting isn't very good. The chase sequences on foot aren't really great as there are some navigation issues. Though the game is HUGE with MANY cases and the DLC also contributing to the list, there's not much to do outside the story missions which somewhat ruins the fact that these guys toiled so much to recreate this beautiful city. The PC port, though it has many of the features other PC ports lack like a good options menu and reasonable mouse support, it still is quite wonky though I wasn't too distracted by it.Minor faults don't bring down this excellent game though. It is something I would definitely recommend to any gamer who wants to play a linear story-driven non-action intensive game. Suffice it to say that after I was done, I missed the game and felt just a little hollow inside.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A criminally underrated game, a flawed masterpiece and one of my absolute favourites. If you love point and click games, games where you play as the detective or are just a fan of the noir genre: this one's a must-buy for you folks!I played this on the PC back in 2012 and I don't understand why it's taken me this long to make a review for this game... but here it is. I've got 120 hours on L.A. Noire and that doesn't even include the 100 hours or so I've racked up on the Xbox 360. Before I praise the hell out of this game, I'd like to go over some issues with this game in general:1. The main campaign's quite long (~20 hours) and at-times repetitive. This might not be a con for some people but it's worth mentioning regardless. Although there's a lot of variety, you won't shake off the feeling you've already done this x amount of times.2. The city hasn't got much to do in it. Another game, Mafia II, similarly shared this issue but there are street crimes or sidequests to participate in, vehicles to find and collectibles to attain. The stunning recreation of a 1940's Los Angeles is worth exploring but unfortunately there's not a lot of reasons to do so.3. The port is locked to 30 FPS. This is not a dealbreaker for people like me but again, I thought it was worth mentioning. There also exists several unofficial ways of unlocking this (and there's not a lot of negative side-effects which is neat).4. Performance can be hit and miss for a few individuals. I recommend swapping from Direct X 9 to Direct X 11 and vice versa for those people, as well as changing the Threading mode from ""single"" to ""multi"" and vice versa.With that out of the way, here's why you should get this game:1. The atmosphere. This game oozes it and you'll be immersed right away. Set in the 1940s you are placed in the shoes of a bright star who is rising through the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department. As you play as Cole Phelps and go from case to case: the voice acting and dialogue, the clothing, the cars... every little detail wants to convince you that you are in this setting. And to think an Australian team (Team Bondi) pulled this off. It's incredible and simply deserves to be mentioned.2. The story. The story doesn't reveal itself until later in the game and until then, you're working your way from one case to the next with the occasional collectible newspaper acting as a ""here's what's also going on"" feature. What I liked most about the story is that it's subtle early on and then it all starts making sense. It's nothing super-amazing but I would be lying if I said I didn't think it was good. Bits and pieces of the game world also serve the story well in reinforcing issues and ideas that were present in the 1940s.3. The characters. You've got a large roster with people of all different beliefs and personalities. Everyone feels unique, multi-layered and realistic. The characters further aid in immersing you in this wonderful game.


That's what she said.

4. The gameplay. Most of the time the game's rather slow-paced. You'll be walking or driving to a crime scene while picking up clues, but at points in the game, all hell breaks loose. A man starts a brawl with you! A criminal starts making a run for it! A shootout occurs! Moments like these help break up the monotony, and while most of them are scripted, they really are exciting. Don't go in expecting an action game though. When you're not searching for clues or being a badass: you're doing interrogations. I'll talk about this in the next point.5. The motion capture/interrogations. Never has a game utilized motion capture like this I reckon. When you're interrogating a suspect: you're not interrogating a NPC, you're interrogating someone that looks and acts like a real human being. It's something you'll simply have to witness for yourself. And this doesn't just apply to interrogations - the whole game uses motion capture for every character's face and I couldn't be more pleased with the result. Back to interrogations though... I love them. Some find difficulty with these but it's probably because the choices you have to make - Truth, Doubt or Lie - were originally called: Truth, Coax or Force. I have no idea why they were changed for the final product, as they make less sense. Still, interrogating is where you rely on this motion capture the most to see if the suspect is lying. Just like real life though: don't judge a person soley by their looks or behaviour though!6. The soundtrack. I could go on and on in this section but let me just say this: Team Bondi killed it here. You might not be a fan of 1940s music but you'll be able to appreciate just how accurate the setting feels.7. Everything else. The huge open city to explore. Being able to slap on a black and white filter in the options menu is just another thing that makes me love this game. Swapping between costumes for Cole Phelps is really nice too. Making different choices and the somewhat linear missions changing up a little to reflect this. The little conversations between Cole and his partners as you're driving in a car throughout the city. And if you don't want to drive? Being able to make your partner transport you to the destination in a few seconds or so. It's all small stuff in the end but it's the icing on the cake for me.Hopefully you can see why this game is so special to me. I believe this game still doesn't get the recognition it deserves but it's great to see more and more people are experiencing this gem. It's definetly not perfect but I believe this is a game that needs to be placed in a ""try this game before you die"" list. Writing this review... I suddenly have the urge to revisit Los Angeles. Rating 9/10.If you do plan on buying this game, I have to insist on getting the DLC for this game. It adds 5 great cases that slot seamlessly into the main story, as well as some new outfits and collectibles. I promise it's worth it.P.S.

												Review for L.A. NoirePros :- Awesome Playable Character- Strong Story- Amazing Face Animationscons :- 30FPS Lock on PC- Games looks outdated.Review : In L.A. Noire you play as Cole Phelps, War Veteran Who fought in the Second world war in The American army in Japan.After the war returned to Los Angeles he starts to work as a Cop, but after proving himself, he becomes a Detective...In the game your main goal is to solve cases as good and as truly as possible...in a City filled iwth Corruption and shady Characters...One of the things you will be doing alot in this game is Looking around, looking for clues.Interrogating people is also a big part of the game, Here is where the Face Animations play a big role...it can be really hard to see if someone is lying or telling the truth.Knowing this is a Rockstar game doesn’t mean its a shooting game or something like GTAyou're not allowed to just randomly kill people on the street or to carry a gun when you want.As a LAPD Detective your job is to protect the people of Los Angeles.There also isn't a Open world to this game, While doing mission you can have little sub mission in them,i noticed when i was driving to my next location some random event could happen on the streets, and its my choice to do something or just keep driving.this give it alot of replay value and just changed the passing abit.Overall I really enjoyed this game, and i clocked 21 hours in my first Play I also felt pretty sad and empty when the game ended.Hope L.A. Noire 2 is on its way.Release date : 20th of may 2011Developer : Team Bondi,  Rockstar North,  Rockstar San Diego,  Rockstar Leeds,  Rockstar New England,  Rockstar Lincoln.Publisher : Rockstar Games.Category : SingleplayerWebsite : http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/Platforms : Xbox360, Playstation 3, and Microsoft Windows.(Always do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.)[sorry for any grammatical errors]Follow my Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was revolutionary in gaming technology. Key word being WAS.I find myself having difficulty reviewing this game. It's such a mixed bag. In a nutshell, This game is fine. Just fine.The story follows you, a police officer played by aaron staton (More famously Ken Cosgrove from ""Mad Men"") as you solve cases in 40's Post war Los Angeles. Rockstar did well developing the enviroment. It does actually feel like i'm in a different period when I play this game. The story is solid, the characters are well written, and yes, the faces look legit. Thats pretty much the reason that I play the game.The game is on the other hand, a game made for consoles. The port is cancer.Good luck trying to boot it on windows 7. I had to jump through hoops just to get it playable. Oh by the way, there is a 30 fps cap. Read it agian. 30 FPS CAP. Even though you can disable it in the game files, the game really doesnt want you to. The reasoning behind this is that the facial animations were only RECORDED in 30 fps. you have the game running at 60 and the faces running at 30 and you get some weird graphical errors. Not to mention that on top of this the game is horrendously optimized. I mean cmon bondai. The game looks mediocre even for the gen it was made for, and you still can't make it run on older hardware.Anyhoo, Game is still fun enough to play because of the characters and actors. I'd reccomend it, but barely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Guide for L.A. Noire
By: ƝƖƓӇƬƁƦЄЄƊ

			I made this guide because the thread I posted to the community forum seems to have helped a lot of people. With this information in the form of a guide I'm hoping that it serves as a better source of knowledge on what...		


ORIGINAL REVIEW:Long story short, I found out that with an old, alternate version of L.A. Noire installed along with the Steam version that the Steam version worked perfectly. No Steam files were modified which led me to check the registry for changes.I used a registry compare tool and found out exactly which keys were added by installing the alternate version. I exported the 4 error handler keys and have included the download link here. Run these and the game should run just fine!I sincerely hope this helps you and that you're able to enjoy this incredible game once again!EDIT: People on the community forum have confirmed it works, try it out! ;)LINK:https://www.dropbox.com/s/pce4tzf7n5q289a/L.A.%20Noire%20Error%20Handler%20Reg%20Updates.zip?dl=1Mirror:http://www.filedropper.com/lanoireerrorhandlerregupdates ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really makes you feel like a professional detective of the LAPD. To be honest, this game can be repetitive sometimes, but addictive at the same time due to a great storyline behind Cole Phelps. You really have to take your time and assimilate the cases properly and find all the clues to find out the real guilty. What make me really love this game is the 40s atmosphere, on the post-war period, and of course see LA and Hollywood recreated on these period, with the old cars, interesting places, clothing, lifestyle... The face MotionScan is something unbelievable for a game made in 2011, so original and novel, the facial expressions just seems like real people that you can understand only seeing his facial movements.  Love that LA Noire mention the atrocious murders of Elizabeth Short and Jeanne French (Celine Henry in-game) by probably the mysterious Werewolf, besides you can do two cases about these murders and investigate them. Surprising final part, don't liked too much the end though, everything can't be perfect. Definitely, one of the best games Rockstar ever made, and my favorite in this company along with Red Dead Redemption.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FYI I'm a fan of this game with `100% completion rate and platinum trophy on PS3. I don't think it's a bad game, I just find Rockstar's execution for PC port terrible.Update: I have found myself a fix to get it working. The similar method which I used to get it working was posted by Nightbreed down below this review.P.S.This game has potential for screenshotting:

												One of the most unique games of it's kind, L.A. Noire is a tribute to old noir films of it's era. While it is open-world most missions are cases that serve as the main story. Don't go into it expecting 1940s gta because since you are a detective you cannot commit any crimes. Go into it expecting a more linear experience akin to Mafia 2. 19.99 is reasonable, but on sale this is an absolute must.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a frustrating and disappointing game.The most basic flaw with the game is the poor and inconsistent logic that's used to govern interrogations, which is the game's primary mechanic and conceit.Interrogations work like this: you ask a witness or suspect about a topic, and he gives a response, at which point you have to choose between three options to characterize that reply -- Truth, Doubt, or Lie. If you choose Lie, you must select a piece of evidence that contradicts the interviewee's statement. A correct choice nets you experience and possibly a new clue or lead, while a failure may shut down the rest of the interrogation.The problem is that sometimes you will have evidence that suggests a person is lying, but the game expects you to choose Doubt instead. Other times, the game expects you to accuse the interviewee of lying in cases where you're not calling out a specific lie, or where the evidence that the game wants you to use to substantiate the accusation does not clearly contradict the interviewee's lie.Here is an example; I'll be a little vague and change some names and details so it shouldn't be too much of a spoiler:Towards the end of a case, I was in a room with a crook that we'll call Tony. In Tony's office I found some clues, including some forged documents that were noted as having come from a corrupt businessman that I'll call Levy, as well as hard evidence that Tony had leverage over Levy. Also worth noting is that I had interviewed Levy earlier, and Levy's records helped lead me to Tony's location.During my interview with Tony, my character asked for information about co-conspirators -- this is apparently so you can learn about Levy, in case the player has not already encountered him in the course of the investigation. Tony stonewalls, saying he acted alone. To me, the correct response to this would be to call him out on the lie, and cite either the forgeries (which had Levy's name on them), or the evidence that shows that Tony has leverage over Levy (though it's really both of these pieces of evidence COMBINED that make Tony's lie obvious). But no, the ""correct"" response is to Doubt, which gets Tony to give up Levy as co-conspirator.In the follow-up question to that, my character asked who Levy is and where I can find him. This was completely stupid as my character had already interviewed Levy and knew exactly where he was. The stupidity was then compounded when Tony claimed that Levy is one of the gangsters I shot dead on my way in to Tony's office. However, I couldn't think of any evidence I could cite that contradicts that lie (""the fact that I know Levy's face"" is not a selectable piece of evidence in my notebook) so I selected Doubt. Wrong answer. Apparently, THIS is the spot where I was supposed to call him on the lie, by citing either of two pieces of evidence that did absolutely nothing to disprove Tony's claim that one of the dead gangsters is Levy.Those two pieces of evidence were a log in Levy's possession that showed that he sold the forged documents to Tony, and a scrap of paper that another detective gives you that basically just has Levy's address on it. I guess by the game's twisted logic, these two pieces of evidence each serve as a proxy for your own character's knowledge of Levy, because if you have the former evidence, or if you followed up on the latter evidence, you would know what Levy looks like. Instead that nonsense, why couldn't the game be scripted to simply check that I've encountered Levy and bypass the whole co-conspirators line of the interrogation, and just credit me with the rewards for having done the earlier legwork?It's because the game has a system, and even though that system isn't robust enough properly handle the situations that are written into the game, I guess they felt the need to stick to the system for the sake of consistency, even though the logic the system ITSELF uses is anything but consistent.The above situation also demonstrates how the game's writing can be a bit weak. What did Tony have to gain by saying Levy is one of the dead guys? He's making a false statement to a cop when he knows we already have enough evidence on him to convict, which is just going to add time to his sentence. He'd already given me Levy's name, and it would take a truly inept cop to not follow up on that and find Levy. He could be trying to protect Levy, but that doesn't make a lot of sense either -- the game makes it seem like Tony was just using Levy. At that point, Tony should've either stayed completely quiet, or he should've sold Levy out, without playing any more games. The self-incriminating middle ground approach that Tony takes is simply a contrivance to create one more piece of gameplay for the player to work through.This is just one case, but I experienced things similar to the above in basically all of the early cases. Too often you can have a solid understanding of the situation and the characters, but the mystery you face as a player does not lie in the details of the case -- but rather is figuring out what the game itself wants from you.The game also has some other issues. One annoyance is that you can drive from crime scene to crime scene, but as far as I can tell it's fairly pointless and boring. Either you end up driving around recklessly in GTA fashion (which doesn't make sense since you're playing the role of a notoriously straight-laced cop) or you sit at red lights and navigate city traffic with overly sensitive arcade-style controls. Fortunately, you can have your partner drive to your destinations for you.Another problem is that you can't directly review evidence you've collected after you've collected it. You do have access to a LIST of the evidence you've collected and a brief summary of it, but the summaries sometimes lack important info. I encountered one case where I acquired two separate pieces of evidence at different times -- both were documents that had a lot of information on them, but where it wasn't immediately apparent which details were important. You'd have to cross-reference them to draw a useful conclusion, but you CAN'T directly cross-reference them because the summary of each document that you have in your notebook doesn't include the pertinent info.Another thing worth noting is that this is a bad port. The aliasing (jaggies) are absolutely horrible, and the in-game AA feature seems to do absolutely nothing, even cranked up to 3X, which for some reason is the maximum. The frame rate is locked at 30 FPS (apparently due to the technology utilized in the facial animations -- a reasonable compromise would've been to have capped the frame rate during dialogue/cinematics, but uncap it elsewhere). Anistropic filtering is limited to 4X for no apparent reason. Screen tearing is rampant and there is no V-Sync option to address it. The game looks pretty bad, but would look fine if these technical features could be enabled and worked the way they are supposed to. It also seems to be poorly optimized -- I have a i5-2500k, GTX 670 and 8 GB of RAM, and at high/balanced settings, there was still some noticeable stutter.I haven't played deep enough into the game comment on the overarching story, but from what I have heard, it is also not one of the game's strong suits. I have since learned that there is a plot twist that I would've found infuriating if I had put more hours into the game.Overall, the game doesn't have any strong suits, other than the quality of the animation and performances during interrogation scenes, and there are some nice period touches that help capture that Noire feeling. But that alone isn't enough to make a game, in my opinion.I've tried a few times to get into this game. I want to like it, but I just can't. It's a shame. I hope someone takes another crack at this type of game though, and learns from L.A. Noire's mistakes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PresentationL.A. Noire has an excellent setting, Los Angeles in the 1940's, and everything the game has to offer feels very true to this setting.The story of the game is very well written, offering insight to life in the 1940's overall as well as focusing even more on the lives of cops, crooks, and war veterans.GraphicsL.A. Noire's graphics are excellent. Even though the game's a few years old by now, it still looks spectacular, and nothing in the game is boring to look at.All the animations look great and it's worth to note that there haven't been better facial animations in video games after this game.SoundFrom the sound effects to the songs and shows on the car radio as well as the music that's been carefully selected to feel right in different situations, everything in this game sounds just right.GameplayThere are gameplay elements that will instantly feel very familiar to those who've played any of Rockstar's games before. But there are also many unique features that this game has to offer.The game is divided into different cases during which the players are also able to focus on different side quests like dealing with street crimes and finding different cars and landmarks.Questioning the suspects and other people of the world is done very well. Although, I have to say that on a few occasions, I felt that the right choices were a bit surprising to say the least.NoteworthyMy playtime of 38 or so hours includes just one playthrough with all the DLC cases included. I also did over half of the street crime missions and unlocked more that a third of the vehicles the game had to offer.I did come across a few bugs during my playthrough, but they were mostly graphical stuff that disappeared fairly quickly. I also experienced some stuttering every now and again, and the game did freeze two or three times during the almost 40-hour long playthrough. However, I feel that these had little impact to how much I enjoyed the game itself.The game does require for the player to log in to a Rockstar Social Club account, but it is possible to choose a ""Default"" account for which the player doesn't have to provide any personal information and which requires no email verification or the like.

												Essentially LA Confidential: The Video Game. The similarities between the two are remarkable, although I'm guessing most of the inspiration originates from the books the movie was based on. LA Noire is not without its problems, but if you approach it thinking it's more like an interactive movie than a video game, you'll probably enjoy it. It just oozes atmosphere and setting. The acting is really good, and due to the incredible facial animations it's not just voice acting that you're watching.  You'll probably recognize various actors from other roles they've played (mostly on TV). It's really like nothing else I've experienced in a video games. The problem is the gameplay. There's a few parts to it: finding clues, questioning/interrogating witnesses and suspects, and fighting/driving. Finding clues isn't all that bad, although it can get kind of tedious. Questioning people is the fun part, as you have to pay attention to character's facial expressions (that originate from the actual actor that played the part). The combat, however, is pretty bad. It's clunky, shallow, and repetitive. Fortunately, it's not a major part of the game, so it's bearable.Overall, if you want to enjoy gritty, noire detective stuff, this game is for you.

												Awesome game from a story/adventure perspective and just the way it recreates a by gone era even if it feels empty and stark once you start to stray from the beaten path. The gameplay can be hit or miss but overall it's worth playing and putitng up with its quirks because at the core it's something that deserves to be experienced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""I can assure you I'm no war hero, detective.""  ~Cole PhelpsL.A Noire is a highly underrated game, emerging from an unusual meeting between open world action game, point-and-click adventure and a 1940' or 50' film Noire.The game places us in the role of Cole Phelps, veteran of the sixth marines, former war-hero from Okinawa who, after coming back to L.A. in 1947, takes up a job in LAPD. Through the course of the game we assist Cole in solving various cases grouped into four desks - traffic, homicide, vice and arson.Each case is diferent, and may require different aproach, but the general tools we use over the course of the game remains the same - we need to gater as much relewant evidence as we can, and later, eventualy use them to prove our point during many witnes questioning parts of the game. To nawigate through this piling mountain of names, locations and objects we get a cool interface feature resembling LAPD detective notebook, that alows us to track case progress anytime we need to.The strongest point of the game is definitely it's plot, settled in an alomost perfectly recreated 40's L.A. Cole's tale, as he rapidly advances through LAPD desk offices and departments perfectly catches specyfic atmosphere of Noire movies from mentioned times, with all it's moral ambiguity and dillemas. Above that every single case tells a story of it's own, often re-telling some well known crime-stories like 'Black Daliah' case, or creating a longer plotline connecting some seemingly unrelated cases.I'd strongly recomment L.A. Noire to any fan of Noire movies, and good thriller or crime stories. The game itself is quite specyfic and to be frank, due to the nature of it, the replayability of this title is very low (what point in solving a case, if You already know the culprit ?), but nevertheless it's still worth playing !Pros:- Amazing storyline based on 40's and 50' film Noires.- Game with one of the most convincing characters in history of VG.- Engine simulating real facial expresions and body language.- Story set in almost perfectly recrated L.A. from around mid 40's.- more than 90 historicaly correct car models to drive !Cons:- Extremely low replayability (due to the nature of the game)- Huge amount of cinematic breaks and introductions slowing the pace of action.- Controls may feel somewhat curde			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DISCLAIMER: IF YOU WISH TO PLAY ON 60FPS, USE WIDESCREENFIXER SINCE THIS GAME IS LOCKED IN 30FPS. FOR FOV, USE FLAWLESS WIDESCREEN AND PRESS EITHER + OR - TO CHANGE THE VIEW. THE PORT FOR THIS GAME ISN'T REALLY THAT GOOD BUT THE GAME ITSELF IS. LA Noire is an open world detective game set in the 1940s after WWII. You play as a Cole Phelps, a marine turned police officer then detective. You solve cases from traffic to homicide to vice and then arson. PORTThis game was ported by Rockstar Seeds who were known for porting other pc games either developed or published by Rockstar such as GTA 4. Team Bondi developed this game for Xbox 360 and Ps3 and a year later, Rockstar Seeds brought it to PC. Like GTA 4, LA Noire isn't really that a good a port, maybe worst if you ask me. There's no mod support so there's nothing anybody can do fix the issues this game has. The PC controls aren't that well so you need a controller. The framerate is capped at 30fps, unless you use the tool I mentioned above, it's easy to use. However some of the physics in the game will be messed up when playing at 60fps, there are videos on Youtube that shows it. But just cap it back to 30fps for a minute and you'll be fine. Also there are plenty of texture pop-ins everywhere you look especially driving. It's obvious how much they truly cared from this console port.GRAPHICSAs stated there are a ton of texture and assets popping up in the screen but you can handle after a little while. The amount of detail in this game is amazing. As a guy who lives in Los Angeles, I actually recognized a lot of buildings in the game, the amount of work put into the interior, and exterior design of the city is beautiful. As you may know, this game utilizes what's called MotionScan, where the developers used 32 high definition cameras to capture actors faces. While it looks great, less attention I believed was put into the bodies since it was done separately. STORYYou start as a cop, then rise to becoming a detective. The story is told by the cases you solve, however the actual story to the game does start later near the end when you're in vice. You can pick up the pieces to the story by picking up newspapers as you're doing the earlier cases. The dialogue in this game is well written but there were some times when I felt that the actors where overdoing it. Above all, the story is really good and dark since that's what you would expect from the noire type of entertainment. GAMEPLAYRockstar may have published this game but it doesn't mean you blast gas stations up with a rocket launcher. To simply put, the gameplay is extremely limiting. You can browse the open world detail of LA Noire but there isn't much to do in this game when not doing the cases. There are mini side quests where help people out but they're really short (Lasts about 1-3 minutes). Interrogation in this game consists of asking a question and wondering if that person's telling a truth or lieing and expose them with evidence, or doubt them if you don't believe them. Like other Rockstar games, there are gunplay but in my honest opinion the gunplay in this game feels like an arcade game. It's not the same as GTA or Red Dead Redemption's gunplay which I think is amazing (Rockstar please bring to PC).CONCLUSIONI believe you will enjoy this game especially when getting the Complete Edition which has every case the game has to offer. I know I haven't said much about your character Cole Phelps but to honest he has no personality at all. You don't know much about him in a personal level. 1.) Port isn't that good (30fps lock)2.) Environment is really well detailed and amazing3,) Don't know much about the character you play as.If on sale, get this game and have fun, it's a long game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 L.A Noire Review Information Game - L.A Noire Publisher - Rockstar Games Developer - Team Bondi Release Date - 17th May 2011 Genre - Action/Adventure Trading Cards - None Achievements - yes(60)When i first saw this game at the store i wondered wether it's gonna be worth it,Rockstar games famous for making games like GTA,Manhunt and Red Dead Redemption gonna make a cop game!? It was a change from their usual games and quite a brave move.I thought this was gonna be a game nobody would remember,but boy was i wrong...   Categories Details   Story In LAN you play as an LAPD cop and later detective named Cole Phelps a former war hero in WW II. LAN is set in the Los Angeles of 1947 which has been created beautifully.In the game you start up as a cop and later get promoted due to your notable breakthroughs.At first it seem LAN has no story and it's just random cases which you have solve but later on as you proceed you unravel a story of army surplus Morphine racketeering and land bussiness scam which has Cole personally involved as his former army freinds are being murdered.It also features many sub-plots and also shows past incidents of Cole's life in the army which forms a major part of the  plot. The game's story is very well told,the way each case in the later part of the game coincides with the plot revolving around the protagonist is wonderful.The cases which are not related to the main plot are very well told as well and most of them are inspired from real life crimes which kinda gives you creeps when you play the missions featuring gruesome murders.The voice acting and facial acting is very well done as well. Yes i said facial acting. Team Bondi has used some technology using multiple cameras and used the real expressions of the actors in the game which along with good voice acting adds to the atmosphere. When the characters talk you feel like they are real people.It is one great feature of L.A Noire. SCORE: 9/10    Gameplay The gameplay of LAN is simply unique.The gamplay ranges from gun fights,melee fights,foot chase,car chase,tailing missions(both in car and foot),driving cars,puzzle solving(riddles and stuff)investigating clues,interrogation.You play the game as a cop and paly through various departments. You start the game as a patrol man then get promoted to be a detective at the traffic department,then to homicide then vice and finally arson.The best missions are the one in homicide and vice.The game's uniqueness lies in it's clue finding and interrogation.In the interrogation you question your witness and when you are answered by the suspect, you must determine wether he/she is telling the truth or lying. You are given three options in this mater, 1st option is truth which you select if you think the suspect is telling the truth,2nd option is doubt which you choose when you think your suspect is lying but don't have any proof and the 3rd is lying when you think your suspect is lying and you have proof to back up your charge.You may wonder how to determine wether your suspect is lying or not well it's by studying the expression of the suspect.As I told you earlier the technology used in this game is unique and the real expression of the actors are used. When people lie they make all sorts of silly expression(susupicious) and when telling the truth they look straight faced.If you accuse a person the of lying make sure you have got proof and from the clues listed in your notebook you have to choose the correct ones as selecting the wrong one will get that question wrong.Though making mistakes won't totally fail the case but getting less than half the questions on the case right fails the mission.Passing the missions is not the only aim,you are even rated from between 1-5 stars,the more stars you get the more salary you earn.Detucting these truth-lie mechanisms are sometimes easy and sometimes hard.You have to stay attentive in order to get the correct clues to branch to the questions. Wether they ae lying or not is mostly easy as while lying the actors make silly suspicious faces,selecting the real clue is a challenge.As this is a cop game you cannot always carry around your gun on the streets and use it,they can only be used during gun fights.Driving mechs are simillar to that of the GTA games and you can take any car on the street and drive it,only this time you don't punch people on the face but show off your batch take the car saying you need it for upholding justice.Driving is pretty easy but don't expect to see Lambourghinis as this is set in the 40's.The game has side missions in the form of street crimes that is crimes that have sprung up immediately and the crime is still in the act where you have to respond quick,it can be chasing the criminals or fighting them.The puzzles and riddles are very well done as well, most of them really challenge your brain while some are very easy.Open world is not directly in the main game(as u r actually solving a case at the beginning of all cases) but from the menu you can select the free world mode and play it but there is nothing of much interest.Crashing cars and damaging properties will affect you rating and minus your salary(though they are of no use in the game).Killing people while driving be penalised as you fail the mission in doing so. Though it has got some unique feature palying LAN at a stretch might get boring. SCORE: 9/10     Graphics The graphics of LAN are mordern considering the date of release of the game(2011) and are sweet to the eyes even now(2015).This graphics quality along with the facial feature technology used in this game for the first time in video gaming history is awesome. The city of Los Angeles of 1940's looks beautiful and is realistic(even features racialy biased cops),It really feels like your are in the LA of 1947. SCORE: 9/10 L.A Noire is a great game for all lovers of adventure and action and suspense story and noire theme lovers and every gamer(until you r a hard core COD fan who feels that COD deserves GOTY).The game is really well done and is worth every penny.Also get the DLC bundle of this game(which i had,and it gives you extra missions).Playing LAN made me feel like a real detective.Go get it,it's a must have in your library.  Overall:9/10 If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												LA Noire is a rather interesting title. It's a Rockstar game but it was developed by an Australian developer named Team Bondi. Why this is relevant is many of the developers from Team Bondi made an eerily similar game called The Getaway which also focused on cinematic action.LA Noire is unlike the Grand Theft Auto games it gets compared to. A big focus of the game is it's cinematics and it's interrogation mechanic. Where the player is required to tell if a character is lying or not. While I would say it was implemented fairly well, unfortunately the developers confuse you every so often with the range of options. Sometime a suspect isn't lying but rather just not telling enough information. And instead of selecting lie you're supposed to select ""doubt"". Thankfully the developers also implemented a lifeline style mechanic where you can ask the community what the most commonly selected responses are.While I would say LA Noire was an excellent game unfortunately it was an imperfect one. The game starts out exceptionally well and the quality of the writing stays consistant until the middle. After the homicide desk the writing begins to get worse and worse, to the point when you get to the ending you begin laughing at how ludicrous the entire thing is. I wouldn't say the experience isn't worthwhile but don't go into this expecting it to be Red Dead Redemption levels of satisfaction.It's unsurprising to find out this game had two entire desks cut (of which 4 remain in the final release) considering the storyline remains just a little half baked. It's unfortunate to see with such an ambitious game, but since it was in development for 8 years it's surprising that it came out at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire has a dark secret and I am NOT talking about it subject matter! The game was programmed for consoles, then ported to the PC with minimal thought. This game, only runs on specific configurations of PCs. If one tiny thing about your PC is ""iffy"" in the opinion of the game, then it is likely that it will not even run! .NET archecture issues are common with this particular port.Tech support is nonexistant for this product! Avoid this port at all cost. Buy at your own risk. ALL the game time I have for this game is just me see the same title card over and over (as the game attemps to actually boot) with zero gameplay experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing L.A. Noire for around 400 hours on the PS3 version, I can safely say this is one of my favorite video games ever. Everything about it is PERFECT. I love the realistic facial movements and the setting. The story is great too, badass ex-soldier in the police force catching the crooks and solving tough cases with little help is always great. The DLC's are FANTASTIC too, especially the Nicholson Electroplating DLC. I loved it so much. If you're having second thoughts about this, don't. Get it on ANY console and play it. I can't say ""pc master race"" for this because although the graphics are definitely better in the PC version, it's still locked to 30FPS. Although that doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece. Please, just immerse yourself in Los Angeles and play this wonderful game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It crashed a few times and it's capped to 30fps (BUT it's not that bad, this is not an action game, 60fps are better but are unnecessary in this case)Not for everyone. This is not really a cons but... even if the game is tagged as ""Action"", if you are buying this game expecting a GTA you'll be disappointed. Shootings and pursuits are just a (facoltative) part of the gameRockstar DRM :C ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many have complained that the game wont start. The soultion is to, turn off  ""Beta testing"" option in Steam and the game will work again. The other problem people might have is 30 fps, this can be fixed by using the ""wide screen"" option in desktop/ graphics option prior to the game menu.  This is a flawed masterpiece and one of my absolute favourites along with GTA, Max Payne and Mafia 2.L.A. Noire's absorbing investigations and intoxicating sense of Noir style make it an unforgettable journey through the seamy side of the City of Angels.L.A. still had streetcars in 1947, but it was a city quickly becoming dominated by the automobile, and that's the only way to travel in L.A. Noire. Thankfully, driving is fun. The gunplay is very easy to pick up. You can hide behind cover, and pop out to squeeze off shots. L.A. Noire isn't all about badgering people, though. This is still an open-world game. You're free to deviate from a case, explore faithfully recreated 1947 Los Angeles, and tackle more action-oriented missions. No, you can't run wild like in Grand Theft Auto (you're a cop, accept it), but there are some other things to do. Forty ""unassigned cases"" come in as calls on the radio.Gunfights, foot chases, car chases, and the occasional simple brawl don't just spring up during cases. They're also a regular part of the street crimes that are reported over the radio, which you can choose to respond to or ignore. The voice acting is good and the visual face effect when someone is tense after telling a lie, is brilliant made. The  game has car chases, gunfights, and a point-tally to judge the quality of your police justice, but it's a slow-paced, meditative experience. The focus isn't on how good you are at scoring headshots with a pistol but instead your ability to read a suspect's face and determine if he or she is telling the truth, holding something back, or flat out lying.I felt that even if the  game had  21 cases, some of which can take more than an hour to complete, L.A. Noire drags at times because it recycles the same drama and you cant help feeling a sense of Deja Vu. There's an omniscient narrator in the early missions of L.A. Noire who disappears halfway through and never returns. I also felt that Phelt story was forcefully told and often too hasty and in bits so you never get the whole picture about his personality or his past.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is about a detective named Cole Phelps that worked in post-WW2 late 1940s Los Angeles. Gameplay is open world and consists entirely of interviewing/interrogating people, chasing suspects with cars/on foot, shootouts with criminals, and walking around crime scenes or area of interest to find clues and evidence. This is a pretty unique game since it's made by Rockstar, which is well-known as the creator of GTA. You get to be the good guy this time, including chasing & ramming cars that will be ended with you busting the suspect GTA-Style (remember Busted scene in GTA? you're the cop here).  Even with obvious low-budget graphics, the story was very well made and the characters expressions (face and voice) are EXTREMELY 'alive' compared to other games. This is because you get to judge whether someone is lying or not by facial expression/voice tone. Ah, if you're a classic car lover, this game paid a lot of attention to them. In short, L.A. Noire is a very out-of-the-box interesting detective game that is definitely worth the price.Now let's talk about the good things first. I'm no policeman and I have no experience in any police work, but I dare to say that with a huge amount of available cases and side missions, the game will definitely satisfy your thirst of 'problem solving' or 'mystery' or straight out 'detective work'. I definitely can't say it's realistic (apparently, shooting someone in the leg made fatal chest wounds) but it's...well-designed. The cases are all realistic with carefully designed motives and chain of events. You'll find the thrill of being in a crime scene looking for clues like footprints, shoe sizes, blood traces, injury marks, and other 'detective stuff'. You also get to judge whether someone is telling the truth or lying by looking into their faces and voice tone. Facial expression is carefully designed to show real-life 'lying' or 'truth' or 'holding out' expression (e.g. eyes looking left when lying). Bored of the same routine? Whenever you're driving, you'll receive dispatch calls that will give you side-missions. So yeah, the main advantage of this game is its well-designed gameplay.The bad parts of the game is really not that much and does not affect the gameplay. Graphics looks very low-budget, it's as if they put all of the graphics money into character's facial expression realism. But in my opinion, it's still in the acceptable level. The weapon choice is also very limited, only Colt 45, Thompson, M1 Garand, and BAR. Since the game is not focused on the gun fights, this issue has miniscule effect.  And as a good guy, you don't get to do the legendary GTA reckless driving. You don't have to follow traffic rules and all but you can't run over pedestrians or ram cars that cut you off if you don't  want your case report to be ruined. Some of the cases are also pretty complicated, giving you a long list of person of interest and clues. This particular mission gave me the 'What am I doing? Who the heck is this guy? Whoa, now who are you? What's their connection to the case?' moment. But that's the fun part, right?In conclusion, the gameplay is very unique and I don't think there are many open-world detective games out there. This advantage makes this game a 'must-play' for me and it's worth every cent. I spent over 13 hours and I'm not even a quarter finished of the whole game. The cons of the game is almost meaningless and it will not ruin the gameplay. I definitely recommend this game, it's worth it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Chasing a suspect while 10 people got ran over in the process"" 10/10 - IGNOkay for the serious review, I love this game so much. It's one of my favorite game among of any other games I owned and still replayable until now. So the storyline sets in 40's, this game made by Rockstar but you didn't expecting to be a gangster or a criminal just like any other Rockstar games but instead you became a police officer all the way to a detective in Los Angeles and your task is to protect the city by.... you know, solving crimes and stuff. For investigating the crime scene, you can find some clues around the place like blood, weird paycheck or any other interesting things for you to show some evidence to anyone you're going to interrogate. The game has very intensed motion capture to show the emotion of certain victim, suspect or anyone you're questioning whether you see his/her face like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off or really sad and its up to you to confirm if they're lying or said the truth. Graphics are good too for a game that releases in 2011 and you can see some tiny details popping out from the map. Talking about the map, its not really that 'open world' just like GTA series but there are some random activities you can do like chasing a criminal while you're on free time or collecting some vintage car somewhere around the map to keep you hooked up. Oh you can also change the game colour into black and white if you prefer the 50s Noir Movie-ish. So thats really about it and why not you pick this game up if you feel like to become a detective and want to play something different than the other. But I recommend for you to pick this game up on sale but hey thats just my opinion. Also I'll give it 8.7/10 :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""SHUT YOUR FU*KING MOUTH. SINCE WHEN DOES A BAG MAN WORK A CASE?""It's been almost a year since I wrote something up here. But well, everybody is at some point back, where he started, so I figure it out, why just don't write up the review for a game, which is in my personal TOP 10. Right?When I look back, and check all the products, that Rockstar Games has put out, I'm not even sure if I'm able to name at least one, which was average or even under that. They even made a fantastic movies, didn't they?When they try to make open world game, it's understandable that comparision with Grand Theft Auto is not anything bad.  Red Dead Redemption v. GTA. / Bully v. GTA. / The Warriors v. GTA (My lord, The Warriors are even better than GTA in some way) / and also Midnight Club for some reason. And there comes the L.A. Noire. New genre that R* step a foot in, and got out as a king again and again and again. L.A. Noire is as you of course know the detective game set in 40s Los Angeles. You can compare this to Sherlock Holmes games, and Cole Phelps will be still better detective. Story is so gripping that one case might drives you crazy, and then you realize that Rockstar is just master of art in the gaming world.There is one thing, that I also realized during the exploration of LA which is really huge and more realistic than GTA V would ever be. However, the developer itself pretty doesn't give a flying f*ck if people discover beautifulness inside. I am talking about hidden spots and interesting places all over the Los Angeles. It's pretty usual that some devs puts spots out to player to see them. R* is not doing that way. They put tons of spots, and hide them even more than usually. This game is filled with landmarks, and especially golden film reels which are pretty difficult to spot. Thing is, that even after discovering 30 of various world-famous places and 50 hidden golden films, you can go further, explore on your own, and discover spots that wasn't made for casual player, but for true explorer. I've been to LA this year, and I must say, that a lot of places that are shown in this game, looks practically same (not just landmarks, also the standard streets at some point) no matter the time game is set was more than 70 years ago. I've talked a lot about the town, but I have to be honest with you, but town is most enjoyable thing for me personally in the game. More than the characters, more than Cole and more than the story and cases. More than 20 cases ready for you (which lenght of the one might be easily above 40 mins) 40 side street crimes, and enormous spots to discover for you. Great thing was, that besides the main story line, there was a lot of different stories going all way along and meet each other in the end.I've got to tell you much more, but I will leave it. I don't want this review to be another Saints Row 3 review of mine :XBonus Point: AtmosphereRating: 10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, there has been some time since I've played a game this intriguing. L.A. Noire is more like a classical 'noir' movie rather than a computer game, and you get to play the star of the movie! The storyline centers a young, promising police officer -later detective- named Cole Phelps in 1940s Los Angeles. His tale has everything: crime, murder, trauma, love, politics, justice, conflict of interest and ethics... mostly conflict everywhere.The atmosphere is magnificent, graphics are more than satisfying and story builds around many twists and turns, always keeping you wondering about what might come next. The investigation process is well displayed, heavily depending on observation, whether it be a mimic of a suspect, or a tone in the witness' voice. The environment is wast and it is possible to get lost if you're not following the map indicators. You carry the full option of roaming the streets of L.A. to hunt for all kinds of achievements, and even venture out to solve trivial street crimes. I once again agreed that Rockstar never abstains from investing in environment design.Controls of the game is a bit hard to master in PC though, I think this game is better suited for PS or Xbox in that manner. Vehicles are impossibly hard to control - at least for me, but my reflexes were never that great so I'm not the one to have a final call on that -  and that would be the sole minus for me that I've observed so far. I found myself preferring my partner to drive rather than myself, and that's a bit disappointing. Oh, well: I'm not in for the perfection anyhow.I recommend it with CAPITAL CHARACTERS; for the story, graphics and display altogether.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire: One of the greatest detection games that was ever made.+ Great story.+ Great gameplay.+ Great graphics (The game came out in 2010).+ Great soundtracks.+ Great voice acting.Once you start playing this game and you get into it, its really hard to quit it until you finish all the cases. One case closing open's another case. The game is so well made, and I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes a good detection and mystery game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start by saying that this is probabaly one of the most underrated rockstart games. Hell, it's probabaly one of the most underrated games in general. While the game can be a little anoyying at times, and boring towards the middle, seeing the ending and how the story unwinds is really worth it. You can tell how much work was put into this game. It's insanley detailed. This game has movie/RPG elements so if you're into that, give it a shot!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best detective game on Steam at the moment. You play as Cole Phelps, a veteran who went into police work in order to keep serving his country and dispense justice. As you play, you say to hell with procedure and take the initiative to solve the crimes the lazy detectives are glossing over. This gets you promoted to become a full-time detective, and you make your way up the hierarchy of crime investigators.I'm not gonna bother dividing these things into pros and cons. If you need a detective game in your life, buy it. If you don't, read this review and buy it.GAMEPLAY:You're not buying the game for this:- This is a third person open world game, yet it has nearly nothing to find or do in terms of free roaming. Between missions you may accept a street crime side mission, but they often boil down into a chase, a car chase or a shoot-out, all of which probably won't get your blood pumping. Do yourself a favour and just follow the story; it's pretty long.- The combat is boring and generic. The weapons bear no real feeling of impact and you can take a lot more bullets than the bad guys. Melee combat is practically unexistant. The combat is merely a way of prolonging the game and supplement the story.- No reward or change if you decide to go for a non-lethal arrest.- The driving is nothing spectacular. It's far less enjoyable than in most Rockstar games in that it's pretty slow and car chases force you into just trying to keep the driver in sight until the game decides that he's arrived at his final destination. Occasionally you will be able to have your partner shoot out the suspect's tires, which feels alright, but you won't be aiming.- Interrogation is a pretty fun mechanic which is probably what this game is known for. You have to read the suspect/victim's facial expressions and pick up on uncertainty or curious claims, then decide if they're lying or telling the truth and reveal more info/clues if you answer correctly. Sometimes you'll be dealing with good liars that the game won't tell you about, who tell you their side of the story very rigidly and confidently, but without the facts adding up. This is to make sure you know have an overview of the case and it's a very nice touch.- Facial features and animations are great, since a fairly thorough facial motion capture method was used for every character and gels very well with the story. As a result, every character in the game looks like the person who performed the voice.- The game is locked to 30 FPS for the facial motion capture to work.STORY:The reason this game is nothing short of phenomenal:- Between cases, you will sometimes get a clip that goes back to Cole's participation in the war in Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbour. From the very beginning of the game, you'll be seeing these clips/flashbacks and they will play into the story as you progress. The way the game creates parallel story lines that eventually cross into eachother is absolutely fantastic.- The cases are often connected to eachother in some way; I can't say much without spoiling it. - They're also fairly devoid of plot holes and create a comprehensive and complete experience.- The job eventually expands into your personal life, even though it initially doesn't seem like you even have one.- Characters from the story occassionally appear in the side missions (street) crimes, which is a nice touch but it won't mean or matter much.- The atmosphere is extremely immersive and convincing; when you launch this game, you turn into L.A.'s top detective in a realistic city based on real places with real landmarks. The music amplifies the detective noir vibe and is probably the final aspect that gets you into the role.Every character wears clothes and sets their hair in a way that is true to the time period as well.- The voice acting is absolutely beautiful and convincing in every aspect. Team Bondi really scratched together some very talented people.L.A. Noire does what is does very well, and as long as you're willing to look past the FPS cap and just follow the main story line, you will be an experience richer.The interrogation mechanic might get dull after a while; for this I recommend you consider what you'd answer in a situation and then look up the correct answer in a guide to keep you trekking along.

												The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, The Big Combo. Why am I mentioning these movies? Because this game is a movie. The name is L.A. Noire. It takes a lot from the style of film noire of the 1940s. With that being said you're in for one hell of game. Absolutely fantastic story and characters; combined with a beautiful map and fun gameplay. It's a very unique game in my opinion; there aren't many like it. I stretched the game out for a long time (almost 6 or 7 months) so when I finished it was almost like I had binge watched a tv show on netflix and it was coming to a close. One of the few games that actually made me emotional at the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who's considering it. The game is usually very cheap during $ales and the game is rather lengthy so it's a steal. WHERE'S MY SEQUEL?!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most unique game I would recommend to any gamer that has strong sense of justice, and is ready to take on a game that's not like any other.   From wild car chases, bank robbery shoot outs, interrogating suspects, all behind beautifully recreated 1940s LA enviroment, that will keep you entertained for hours.Aside from the well thoughtout dialogue and huge open world to explore,  this game's highlight goes to facial expression each character makes.  Thanks to ""emotion scan technology"", LA Noire raises the bar in realism to the next level.  You would have to play it to believe it.  Love the boldness from Rockstars on making such unique game by staying away from streamline genre and using new technology to bring out a timeless master piece.Screen Shots

												Finally a game where you play as a cop! And not some traffic warden but a Los Angeles detective Cole Phelps.The investigation process is the second best part of the game, after the story (see below). The search for clues will make you really punctilious and bring deep insight into all cases. The interogation is even better with the best game facial animation I have ever seen making some characters an obvious liars whereas others might seem honest. What kind of police officer would you be without chasing criminals? This takes me to the third part of police work and that are the gunfights and chases on foot or in cars. These elements aren't the main plus of the game since it's not a shooter of any kind - if you want to buy the game for the action only, don't. However, though these are weaker than in Mafia II for example, they are a nice contrast to the peaceful investigation and they balance the neat investigating with some action, which is important for you not to get bored from finding clues only.Apart from the extraordinary facial animation the graphics is about average. The city of LA is really big and contains lot of hidden secrets, such as cars, sights etc. for completionist gamers. Though the city really is wonderful, it doesn't feel as lively as it might be. Apart from the cases and street crimes, there isn't much to watch. But that isn't much of a drawback - not many games have that (maybe the Watch Dogs will).Finally, the story. There's a lot to spoil so I'll take this just briefly. It focuses on many things and mentions lot of important topics, which make it really strong. As set in the year 1947, it connects the horrors of war and Cole Phelps' military history with the police investigations and lot of other topics, you'll encounter in the streets of LA such as drugs, racism, prostitution, rapes and lot more. I enjoyed the last Arson desk a whole damn lot because it shows nobody is plain black or white, evil or good. Some characters are antagonists, though you feel the morale in their acting, others have it the other way round. It also shows how thin line lies between good and bad, between friends and enemies.To sum up - this game promises something quite different from others as you'll be playing at the right side of the law meaning lots of new aspects and a fantastic story. The weakest thing I can think of is that you cant skip the ending credits :)9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is a beautiful tale of the grime that lurks just below the surface.GAMEPLAY:     There are 4 main types of gameplay at work here the first is investigation, the second is interrogation, the third is car chases, and the fourth is gunfights. The first and second forms mentioned make up the meat of the game with 90% of the game consisting solely of walking around, picking things up, and talking to people. The gunplay and driving could both be improved, but they both occur so infrequently and can be skipped that it is hardly considered a real negative. The biggest issue I have with the gameplay is the ""Truth, Doubt, Lie"" function. The majority of the time you'll be going out on a whim if you doubt or lie. The best you can do is choose lie first to see where Cole takes it, and if you didn't mean to head that direction choose doubt instead. Also a lot of the time what you need to present for lie will be a toss up for 2 items and the one you choose probably won't be it even though it could work. The fact is though I can't think of any way to solve the issues it has.STORY:     This is what the game is about. I don't want to spoil anything about the story, but just remember to never take a single thing you hear at face value not even the character you play. The set up is you play as Cole Phelps a war hero turned LAPD detective in the mid-late 40's. One of the best qualities of this game is the writing of all of the characters. Every single aspect of the characters was clearly taken and cared for to be formed into one of the best experiences that can be given to anyone who is willing to look one step deeper.SOUND:    Limited repeated tracks with hit-or-miss voice recordings (some people sound like they were recorded in a cardboard box while standing in the middle of the street) leave much to be desired.Cons:*30 FPS locked*Lots of random stutter*Large wonderful but shallow overwold.OVERALL:If Phoenix Wright had an affair with the 40's this game would be what pops out. And I loves meself some Phoenix Wright. L.A. Noire deserves to be on the forefront of anyone's ""to-play"" list if you have a marginal interest in Noire or love a good  story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since they felt the need to put this on the front page of Steam again, I thought I'd come point out that this is one of the worst PC ports you can play. It's capped at 30 FPS(ugh), meaning it's very choppy. It also has a lot of issues that were never fixed.It's a shame really because it's a nice looking game, but it was basically shovelwared to PC with no effort or respect for the platform. It's a lot like the Dark Souls PC port, which is also terrible. And like that game, it's highly rated. These games are TERRIBLE on PC, yet have glaring ratings. This is why you shouldn't trust Metacritic with console ports. Everyone is over rating these because the console version is good... that's nice and all... except that we're talking about the PC version here, in the PC section, and on Steam. You can also read plenty of reports about crashes or freezes(from people that have actually played it).If you want this, get it on a console. Do not get it on PC. The PC version is absolutely terrible, and most of the reviews(even in the PC section of Metacritic) are praising it because of the console version, aka, idiots that'll probably never even try the version they are giving positive ratings to. Rockstar is another company that cares very little about the PC players, usually just shovelware porting their console games onto the platform. Btw, it also has Rockstar Studios attached to it, even on the Steam version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS+Collecting evidence, examinating corpses and locations and interrogating suspects (or just witnesses) is usually interesting and nice to do, though it does have its flaws (more on that later).+Dialogues are excellently written and acted, watching the plot unwrap or just listening to Phelps and his partner's chatter is always interesting. Helped by the great and highly advertised facial mocap, which still holds its own years later.+The atmosphere is gorgeous, I don't think i've ever seen a more faithful videogame representation of the noir genre and the post-WWII America in general.+Most cases are well written and don't have an obvious solution or an easily guessable culprit. Often, it's not easy to find the evidence to nail him/her and then actually use it in an interrogation to call him/her out on his/her bullcrap, so unless the somewhat slow pace of the game doesn't bother you, you'll rarely get bored.+The overarching plot of the game is interesting too, and you'll be surprised by how many things mentioned or seen early in the game make a lot more sense later.CONS-Some cases are clearly below standard, mostly padding material: they're either short, bland or both, and they'll feel pretty ""meh"".-Free roaming is an option, but it's pretty much just there for the sake of it: apart from some Guide Dang It level collectibles, there is hardly any reason to wander around L.A. if not to enjoy the scenery.-Finding clues can sometimes get tedious, mostly because sometimes some interactable, often important objects are way off course: yeah, i don't want everything blatantly slammed in my face or the game would be too easy, but certain pieces of evidence are in really obscure locations, and usually they're crucial for correctly accusing a suspect or lampshading a lie. Keep the ""clue music"" on, it's nice and it'll help you understand wether you're done or there's an improbable object hidden 60 feet away from the main crime scene.-The PC porting of this game leaves much to be desired: settings are minimal, graphic quality, apart from the higher resolution, isn't better than the console version (buildings were quite basic and low-detail even when the game first came out) and the frame-rate is locked at 30 fps due to the peculiar technology used to mocap the characters' faces not allowing higher values.-Driving and shooting are meh. They're there, some chases and shootouts can help spice things up in an otherwise still good adventure game, but they were clearly not the focus of the development team. They're not bad, simply blandly average.SUMMARYBuy this game if you love its awesome noir atmosphere and you've always wanted to literally be in books like The Black Dahlia, or just because it's a solid adventure game with top notch acting, good longevity and, unfortunately, not a lot of replay value (though if you screw up your investigations you'll probably want to do them again for those shiny 5 stars). Avoid it if you were looking for an action game with deep shooter mechanics or, worse, for a 1940s GTA. This is not that game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

L.A. NoireI loved L.A. Noire from the minute I saw its buzzing yellow title screen on a jazz theme background. If you're even remotely interested in the detective genre, I see no reason not to give this a shot. As usual, Rockstar does a brilliant job of conveying the intended atmosphere and location, i.e. 1940s L.A. and noir genre, while bringing into play some important themes of the era. The campaign is lengthy and involving, the mechanics entertaining and addictive, and the characters flawed and believable (thankfully the likes of Roy Earle bring a bit of much needed levity to Phelps' boy scout attitude).Pros:A good variety of cases building from basic to more complex ones;Meaty, lengthy campaign with obvious replay value to uncover every detail of this solid, mature noir story;Fantastic VO performances all around, superb theme song, decent soundtrack;Looking for clues, questioning suspects and gauging their reaction is engaging and rewarding;Amazing facial animations rendered by MotionScan are a perfect fit for this genre;Handy options to do away with the action/skip to destination if you just want to work the cases;Usual Rockstar attention to detail when it comes to evocative epochal environment/context;Notebook is a clever, non-intrusive alternative to the HUD and, along with the Log, a great way to keep track of things;Change of protagonist and partner is refreshing.Neutral:Auto-turn on stairs and fire escapes is a nice touch;Interrogate half the cast of Mad Men;A bit more variation with NPCs random dialogue would have been nice (""I say we bust in there and find the goddam evidence!"" x99).Cons:Even if it is the intended persona, Phelps is excessively stern and it gets old;Not a lot of (good) reasons to go exploring Hollywoodland;Uninspired/tedious collectibles;Controls feel a little stiff at times, as does the cover system;Some redundant puzzles while collecting evidence;City feels a bit empty/lifeless at times;Some cars in traffic will disappear if you turn the camera the wrong way (bit of a bother for Auto Fanatic).

Justice always wins.At the bottom, there is a short version as a summary for those who don't like to read.Phelps, badge 1247.So.. your name is Cole Phelps. After the end of World War II you return to the country as a hero and as one of the few soldiers who deal well with the trauma of the experiences on the front lines. You have always thought that everything is either black or white and guided by these ideals you are joining the ranks of police in Los Angeles. At first, being a simple novice from the proverbial ""traffic police,"" you manage to get promoted to the rank of detective in a special department of the LAPD, thanks to solved case. From now on, all your days will pass on briefings, visual inspections of crime scenes, interrogations and prosecutions of suspects.Mechanics of investigation looks like this: we arrive at the briefing and we learn what case are we supposed to solve. Then we go to the scene of the crime (most often we are dealing with murder), we are making an inspection of the place and we are looking for evidence that could be helpful in the case. When we are close to some significant object, the game tells us via a specific sound, so we know that in this place there is something important, of course, you can turn it off. Each of evidence gives us some new clues. After collecting relevant evidence (in which may include the murder weapon, bills, bank statements, wallets, pictures and others), it's time to hear witnesses on the scene. When you hear the answer to the question we asked, we can decide whether a person is telling the truth, if you doubt in what he/she says (though we have no direct evidence for this), or perhaps he/she is lying. After some time we reach the potential suspects, in which hearings can be supported by evidence found at the crime scene. A further order of investigation is generally subordinated to the scenario outlined by the authors, however, led by our hearings or visits to key locations can accelerate or delay the investigation. And don't worry, in the final phases of the investigations no shortage of gunfights and car chases, but if you want more shoot, invest in side missions and occupy a street crimes.When it comes to graphic design here is a little bit worse, though facial expressions and general appearance of characters fully make up for that. While the city itself has two sides of the coin: nicely presented (I mean here especially for skyscrapers, parks, alleys and smaller houses), but quite often creates the impression of a slightly extinct. On the streets moves fewer people than would indicate the size of this metropolis. And I must admit that the size of the virtual Los Angeles makes quite an impression when we launch the map available on the menu. The execution of city lacks nothing, but I would feel that it is really alive!Sound design and music is definitely one of the strengths of this production. The soundtrack is filled with 26 songs inspired by the era in which the game takes place and it is not climatically, but simply phenomenal. Subtle jazz sounds in execution of trumpets, saxophones, percussion and string instruments is a mixture, which any movie of the higher shelf wouldn't be ashamed of. A more dynamic compositions also don't stick out on a step from the rest. Equally excellent are the voices of all the characters. This game is a feast for our ears.The icing on the cake in L.A. Noire was supposed to be perfectly devoted facial expressions of the characters created by a special session of the motion-capture engulfing the faces of real actors and I must admit that it works very decently. Although facial expressions, if you can call it that way, are very stereotypical and relatively easy to recognize whether a person is calm or hiding something.SUMMARY (TL:DR)In L.A. Noire players have received what they wanted most: climate, climate and climate once more. Detective sheath, an advanced facial expression betraying emotions of the characters, crime mysteries of the City of Angels, charismatic characters and music that simply melts in our ears compensate for slightly brutal simplification of the sections of arcade and a little disappointing visuals. Sincerely, this is one of my favorite titles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw this game at a friend´s house and thought it had very good artistic values and an intruguing gameplay. Bought it at home and I was glad to see it is a RockStar game. This game has great graphics, runs fast, interesting story progression and good controls. Even though I am not an action fan (I prefer point and click adv. games), I had lots of fun playing LA Noire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+ Intersting Story+ Unique Gameplay- Repetitive Answers- Random Answers- locked 30 fps8/10It's a fun game about being a detective and solving crimes about finding clues and interrogating suspects. You will not find any other kind of game like LA Noire. The bad points are that the game will repeat clues, and you will notice them. Ex: * you found a clue... you should check out the Steam Cafe.      *Gabe says he works at the Steam Cafe... you should check it out.      * The Steam Cafe is located near the crime scene... you should go investigate it.Another problem is when you have to question someone for doubt or lie, you have to somehow bring up a clue that's comepletely off topic.Ex: Gabe: ""I've been working at the cafe the whole time. My alibi clears me!""You: ""You're lying! You're the culprit!""Gabe: ""prove it!""You: you bring up Half Life 3... ""Why isn't this out yet?!""Gabe: ""Oh! You got me!"" *correct answer*Overall, it's a good game with multiple interesting stories of crime. I completely recommend it if you're interested in solving crimes by finding clues and detecting people are lying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's start out with what you will probably be looking at the most: the facial animations are amazing and will help you decide if a suspect is lying or telling the truth. The graphics still look pretty decent for an older game and L.A. Noire has a fantastic atmosphere and a great soundtrack. Altough the game doesn't really have a main story, the individual cases are really interesting and well put together. Even if L.A. Noire is by no mean a free roaming game there are some fun side activity's to do. You can search the city for unlockable cars, view points(certain locations) and there are some side missions to do. The game also has some nice shootouts and chases!Sadly, this game also has some downsides. The city of Los Angeles can feel a bit empty at times and the cases can feel a bit repetitive after a while. After finishing about 70% of L.A. Noire (DLC included) it just felt to repetitive and my interest in the game was lost. I think this is mainly because there is no real story, just some individual cases.All together i would still highly recommend this game. It's truly an amazing expierence and well worth the money, Even if you don't finish it completely.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stop. Stop reading, GET THIS GAME!This is a fantastic story worthy of being slapped with 10/10, kudos and praise. Why? Because this game is like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", it has personality, action and narrative.You are Detective Cole Phelps, and are a badass at solving cases. You will run through numerous cases investigating clues and interrogating suspects, unraveling a conspiracy and a kickass story, and half the time your partners will ""pull rank"" or flat out refuse to do a foot chase and leave it all to you :PPros:OMG GRAPHICS. Did I mention graphics? This game has the most amazing facial graphics ever. It should be, because they use motion capturing on people's faces and you can actually see emotion in their faces!!! Once you play this game you will be disapointed with every game out there that doesn't come up to snuff. It is simply gorgeous, and groundbreaking to tell if someone is lying via actual cues in their behavior and their faces! The interactivity of the game, with player and character are grade A. The gameplayer borrows alot from GTA, with cars behaving similarly but to me feel alot better. The gun play is clunky but intuitive, it doesn't kick you out of cover akwardly or just unwieldy to do sometimes. *cough* Mass Effect *cough*. Overall, it just feels nice and awe-inspiring to see the period perfect LA, based on real cars, on real settings and with distinct personalities. From villains to partners, you will loathe, love and grumble at people who feel real and you could have sworn probably exist in real life.Con:IT IS TOO SHORT. The usual benefits of getting a game on PC are the mods. Well, it doesn't have great mod capabilities and therefore the modding community can't mod new stories and there's so little DLC. I would reccomend buying this on console unless you can find it cheaper on PC.Overall, buy it on console unless the PC version is cheaper. It's simply easier to control and feels more native on console.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. It has a terrific story and atmosphere as entertaining as it gets. Although it isn't a GTA shooting rampage, there are many cons to this game and the mechanics it takes advantage of along the lines of its un-rivaled motion capture technology used from everything to npc conversation to intense interrogations. 11/10 Would force my son to play this game.

												You get to play as a detective, finding clues and solving crimes. It is an open world city that you can move around in, kind of like grand theft auto only more story/mission driven. There is a good mix of driving, detective work, and action with street crimes. It is set back in the 40's and has a nice feel to it. The faces on the characters are really well done, especially since when you are interviewing them you need to watch their expression's and body language to tell if they are lying or not! A fun game and well worth the sale price! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LA Noire is one of the best and most original games ive played in long long while, it has plenty of flaws but it is still very enjoyable.The game is locked to 30 fps to preserve the factions animations while are crucial while interrogating a person and this causes the game to feels slow and sluggish at times and will take a few hours to get used to.The game is set in 1940s and you play as Cole Phelps a war hero who slowly climbs the ranks from patrol to vice and near the end stages of the game you play as jack kelso a investigator who was in the war with Cole.The are 21 main cases (26 if you buy the dlc) and they average around 1 hour each or more depending upon how many restarts and retries it takes you.The 1940s settings is really amazing, the theme overall is mature and the characters are very distinct, the cases are really intriguing to solve and there is a sense of danger in the air.Apart from the main cases their are 40 mini-cases which take 2-10 mins each and a lot of collectables and for a open world games its not really something you want to hear not enough side-quests yet it fits the detective theme of the game so it gets away in that regard.This game stays true to what it is and by that i mean for the most part you will search for clues, interrogate suspects and solves cases in doing so and the combat isnt a huge factor where you mow down hundreds of people, the combat is decent enough but since its not the main focus its serviceable, you get intuition points when you rankup and these can be used to find clues or help you chose the correct response to a question asked to a suspect, the ability to interrogate suspects is the games biggest strength as different people have different tells and you have to chose if they are telling the truth or lying and if you think they are lying you accuse them by doubting them or flatout tell them that they are lying and if you select the latter then you must provide evidence of their lie otherwise you will get it wrong.You can fail cases and get wrong suspects (in cases which have multiple suspects) if you miss any evidence or dont manage to get something out of them.The driving isnt that thankfully you can skip it by letting your partner driver which will skip the driving section of the game.The NPCs always comment on your actions if you driver recklessly your partner will warn you if you run and push citizens aside they will complain,you will pickup your dropped hat, etc LA noire gets a lot of these small things right.There is an option to play it in black in white if you so desire.There is a feature called action skip where it will ask you to skip a section of the game if you fail it multiple but these are only in areas where you wont miss out anything.Overall i really found LA noire to be a mature game where cases are intriguing and is an actual detective game where you do all the detective stuff and not just shoot people, the detective stuff is basically what you will do 70% of the time.I really wish Rockstar will make a sequel one day its been years since this game release and technology has only improved.This game truly deserves a sequel not story or character wise but mechanics wise maybe a Miami Noir or something along those lines, with new tech and ironing out the rough edges of this game i hope we get a sequel but atm we dont and that makes me sad.

												LA Noire is a crime story set in 1947 Los Angeles. Policeman Cole Phelps, a decorated war hero, is eager and principled, and a ""good caseman"". Thus, he works his way up the ladder and gets to investigate in cases with rising stakes. But there is something in his past that is haunting him. Through his eyes, players experience a world gone by that is in many ways similar to ours, yet also quite different - World War II still casts a shadow over society, police work sometimes takes incredible shortcuts just so a case can be closed or what would pass for bigotry today is still widely accepted etc.What utterly fascinated me about LA Noire was the painstaking amount of detail with which the world of 1947 had been recreated: 8 square miles of Los Angeles are waiting to be explored. While it's only necessary to use certain routes to get to case locations, it's always possible (and indeed tempting) to drive around the streets to just take in the sights and sounds (e.g. the car radio plays original programmes). I cannot count how many times I had Cole stop the car so I could check what this interesting building or that odd thing were, or so I could take a screenshot. It's likely the closest I will ever come to being in the 1940s' USA, unless time machines become a reality.Sadly, one can hardly with the game's world outside of the cases; don't assume this to be like Grand Theft Auto. At least there are a few achievements to be gained for those who like to explore every nook and cranny.Phelps will work on the cases the department to which he is assigned at the time, e.g. patrol or homicide. The work on such a case consists of collecting clues at crime scenes, shootouts, fist fights, chases and tailing people by car or foot and the interrogation of witnesses and suspects. The interrogations use a (at the time when the game was made) new technology of facial motion capture that allows the faithful recreation of every small expression in the actors' faces. That is important, because most of the time, people are trying to hide something, which will invariably show in their faces. They have twitchy eyes, swallow nervously, etc.It's up to the player to judge when they're being lied to - but a lie can only be called out successfully when evidence to the contrary has been gathered before, and when the player can correctly pick that evidence from their case notes. If a lie can't be proven, one can doubt what was said. The last option is to treat a testimony as truth.This part often drove me nuts. I could see that the person was not telling the truth, but I wasn't sure what I was even meant to prove or which evidence to use against them. Example below - attention, spoiler for one interrogation question. ----SPOILER-----One example: There was a suspect with a penchant for anarchism who had probably tampered with machinery, and Cole confronted him with the accusation. The man declined. The game asked me: Was he lying? I knew I had nothing to prove he had committed the sabotage, but he looked a bit twitchy. Therefore, ""Doubt"" seemed fitting. Yet the correct interrogation option was ""Lie"", since then, Cole mentioned his political tendencies and the suspect  asked in return whether there was evidence that he was campaigning for anarchism. Okay, so, a different thing to prove.So I chose the political pamphlet he had given to his colleague as proof - after all, passing it on to someone else showed he was proselytizing. Wrong again: The proof the game wanted was the same pamphlet from his own locker.----SPOILER-----Then, there are optional sidequests called street crimes. When Phelps and his partner drive through the streets, they will often get alerted to crimes happening at that moment, and they have the choice of responding and taking care of the situation. Those missions use some of the gameplay elements from the main game, minus the interrogations and crime scene investigation.I did get bored after a while. There is a lot of content to play through, and while the cases are varied and sometimes interconnected in interesting ways, I just had had enough of the game's mechanics. Took me a long break to get back into it.But having followed Cole Phelps through all his cases, I'm left impressed. His world is a very imperfect one, where some people commit crimes for the same selfish reasons that have always driven humans, while others try to do the right thing but may well fail at that. It's indeed a noir movie's take on reality.(Notes:1. To get the Steam achievements, the game must be played online.2. Do stay till after the credits, there is one more scene.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, i guess I would really have loved this game if it would have worked.But it didn't.Turns out that this game does not run on Windows 8.1 or 10 at all.So yeah, don't buy this game if you have one of those versions.I don't know if it is actually able to run on Windows 8 so better google that bevor buying it for this system.Now I am going to wait a little while before I get my refund and see if they will fix it, but I doubt it.What actually did work was the launcher, so here's my review of the launcher:Good options.Many things to click.Great languages.10/10Would launch again.

												AAI + GTAThirty five hours, much longer than I expected it would be. You'll probably spend most of the time driving from one point to the next, but if you ever feel like that's too tedious you have fast travel.Cases were well put together as were the investigations. Shooting gangsters was nothing to write home about, but the vehicle chase segments were fun (even if civilians saw fit to throw themseleves at the front of my car half the time).  Speaking of cars, there's 95 different varieties of magnificently archaic vehicles for you to find and commandeer if that's your thing (it should be). The game might have crashed four or five times but the autosave prevented any serious loss of time. One of the most varied games I've seen in awhile, strong on a lot of fronts and always prime to switch up on you before it gets too stale. Stout Scarab best car in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to be a detective, you must to be to play this game.It's not a sandbox game like GTA, it also not an action game like Mafia II.It is completely a puzzle game!That they use special  facial techniques is pretty awesome, if you've seen TV series ""Lie to me"" you will be easier to understand people who is lying or telling the truth when the face expression and emotions.You must need to figure out those people's conversations how to connect with all crime scene evidence.8/10 - Impressive game.

												So I haven't finished this game on here yet but I accidentally left it on so lmao have some more hours then I've playedANYWAY I thoroughly enjoyed this game - it basically is a point and click but it's not really. The gameplay consists of going to a crime-scene and interrogating people, where deducing whether they are holding something back (doubt), telling the truth, or lying (when they're lying you always need evidence) - with the facial motion capture its usually pretty obvious. You gather clues by finding stuff at the crime-scene used for interrogations and to figure out the case. You drive to and fro everywhere you need to go. Ocassionally the more you get into the game, there will be chase sequences both in cars and on foot, and there will be shoot-outs, as well as when you have to tail a suspect (without being seen, which is annoying). The map is huge, and I suggest if you're an achievement hunter you drive everywhere instead of getting your partner to do it. I enjoyed the story (i guess there kinda was an over reaching one).Each case is pretty interesting, and the game feels very authentic in regards to the period.A problem I have is the FPS cap, because, come on we are on PC here guys we don't have to put up with 30FPS. There are guides to break the cap which is useful.Overall the game is pretty good, I enjoyed it anyway :) its quite a long one though so sometimes replayability (especially as soon as youve finished it, can be a bit daunting).

												L.A Noire is a very successful hybrid between an early 90's adventure game such as Monkey Island and Broken Sword with the open world and combat/driving mechanics of GTA.You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a WW2 veteran who is trying to work his way up the law enforcement ladder of the Patrol/Traffic/Homicide/Vice/Arson division all while trying to deal with the hostility of his co-workers and the inner corruption of the police force. If you've ever watched a Detective Noir movie like L.A Confidential then you pretty much know what to expect plot wise.The adventure part of the gameplay will be familiar to anyone who's played adventure games in the early-mid 90's. You explore the crime scenes of your cases looking for items and clues that will help you in your investigation and then questioning the suspects of the case with the evidence that you have accumulated. The interviewing part is well done with some great voice acting and animation although the facial expressions can be a bit TOO subtle at times, you pretty much can't lose though as the story will still progress even if you get all the answers wrong.The driving/shooting aspect is similar to any other open world game and you will be chasing and gunning down plenty of criminals during the 20-25 hour campaign. The theme and style of 1940's LA comes across really well with a brilliantly detailed city that has plenty of locations to explore, old fashioned cars to drive and a great albeit short period soundtrack.Anyone who is a fan of Noir movies and open world games with a mix of old school adventure will have a great time playing L.A Noire.

												A pretty impressive presentation overall, expecially at the time of release. Definitely worth playing if you a fan of noire or adventure games.The graphics probably won't wow you in 2016 but it still has it's charm with the faithful recreation of LA and the impressive motion capture. If you haven't already, it's worth the purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much to my surprise, I love this game. It's attention to detail, animation, dialogue and story reminded me of when the original Mafia was released.As much as I love it, there are lots of annoyances. I agree with others that interviews can be illogical, but any excuse for more cutscenes and dialogue. Walking and driving controls are the usual Rockstar Engine-irritating.Running around the map with no concequences for your actions, and nothing to fear in the game dissolves any real tension or excitement. Can't catch a bag guy driving away? Don't worry, eventually something is scripted to stop them.Mission failed for shooting a fleeing suspect, but its ok to kill 10 of their friends because they didn't.But my biggest gripe is how beautiful and detailed the world is, but so much of it goes unnoticed or is wasted. Some of the most detailed, true to life and beautiful buildings or interiors are hidden behind doors or tucked away in parts of the map that you're never given a reason to visit. And if you do find them, there is no reason to stay or visit again. It made me realise that I took for granted the stores and mini-games in Red Dead Redemption, for example.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The atmosphere in this game is great, it's a sleazy 1940s LA straight out of a Raymond Chandler novel. The immersion is sometimes broken by the odd daft action sequence but overall the story is well written and executed with great voice acting and facial expressions on the models.The game is really all about the story. Although it is open world there is little to interact with - the huge and beutifully detailed game world is more there for the immersion.The main downside is that it runs horribly on PC. The game engine is locked to 30fps apparently and there are often fps drops whenever there is anything fast happening on screen. When compared to other open world games with fantastic graphics like Mafia 2 and Skyrim this game runs like a one-legged asthmatic pensioner. Seems Rockstar don't make any effort to optimise their games for the PC master race anymore.Overall I can recommend it as the techincal issues are not game breaking because 95% of the time it is exploration/puzzle/adventure type gameplay and not action/shooter type gameplay where the crappy framerate would soon give you a headache.

												An interesting idea and concept, let down by the terrible story pacing for the first 2/3rds of the main story. Not that you can discern there is one at that point. In the last 1/3, the story does finally start going somewhere, picks up the pace and becomes enjoyable. A critical part of the game are interrogations, but deciding what evidence counts as enough to expose a lie vs doubting something, or what ""truth"" or ""doubt"" will actually cause your character to do say are anybodies guess. It always felt like a total crapshoot throughout the game. Never mind that it doesn't actually matter - somewhere during testing the game designers must've realized this and you can't actually fail even if you miss all the answers.This isn't a bad game, but it isn't quite as good as the reviews made it out either. Only play it if the premise sounds enjoyable and you're willing to plow through the first part.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like the 50's?Do you like Detective games?Do you like dark plottwists?Boy do I have the game for you.You Play as Detective Cole Phelps (masterfully performed by aaron Staton) who just came back from the war and became a Police officer. Your main goal is given to you by each completed (or failed) case. What this includes is checking crime scenes and finding evidence that can later help you interrogate suspects who might seem innocent on the outside but holds dark secrets for you to unfold. The game hold action such as gunfights and fist fights but the real main objective is to go old school 50's detecive way. Pros ++ Amazing storyline+ Awesome voice actors+ Great soundscore+ Stunning face movments+ Fist fights are pretty cool (some hate the fist fight scenes though guess it's up to taste)+ over 20+ hours of content (including sidequest and dlc's) the story is far and deep and will take some time for you to find all the clues or finding all the possible ways you can go about a case such as who you might want to interrogate first e.t.c+ Replayability, many games usually fail with this from my perspective. The reason is because you might fail a case and arrest the wrong guy or not finding enough evidence and might wanna solve them all or if you just like the cases (have 80+ hours on my PS3 before deciding to get it on my PC)Cons -- Gun fights are limited to only Tommyguns, Shotgun and Pistols and are very tedious to deal with- The face movement may be awesome as well as the voice acting but it's sometimes hard to tell if they're lying or telling the truth as they tend to do some very shall we say... akward faces. They sometimes makes it way too easy, hard or funny looking- Tedious sidequest as they don't serve any real purpose, sure you can get XP from it but max lvl is 20 and I reached that after just 5-6 main mission quests so they serve little purpose.- Graphical glitches and slow FPS, I didn't have this problem but some have. Some have had poorly made computers whilst others had top of the line gear and still had these errors so it's random I guessAll and all I give this game a 8/10It's no masterpiece, but not far from. It has great voice acting great story and just all around fun.30 euro is and ok price epecially since you get the complete edition			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LA Noire is 3rd person action game that concentrates on investigating crimes by inspecting crime scenes and interrogating witnesses. Cases are more or less unrelated, but still provide great story as a whole. Wish they make a sequal with modern technologies and better optimization.Good+ Story (several stories unravel at once, each on it's own pace)+ Visuals are so-so but face animation was really good for 2011 (yes i know that it just pre-recorded stuff, like movie :( )+ Good balanced approach to investigation (this is no easy mode, like in most of games nowadays, but it helps you a little)Bad- GPU greedy (almost like Crysis back in 2007)- Faces have more details than city itself.- Rockstar Social Club (which does nothing, but slowdown start time)- Not much of replay value- No cloud saves- No SteamPlay (win only)Bottom line: worth full price if you can run it and interested in detective genre.

												What can you say about this game? I played this game back on console and didn't like it's change of pace from a GTA type shoot 'em up open world.Fast forward a few years and as I matured as a person and a gamer, this game has been a hallmark in my gaming adventure. The recreation of L.A is superb, and even though I have ever visited the city, it's the small things that ground the game for me and make it a real place. Like seeing a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes in a store window or hearing a advert for it in the car radio.The cases within the game are well structured, and seem very real. The story is a masterpiece.The PC port itself is quite bad, it is locked at 30FPS. But this, for me, doesn't detract from the game itself and even with that in mind, it is still a highly recommended game from me. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GREAT game!  Seriously, this game is amazingly well done!  The story is very interesting and really fun -- a nice blend of foot chases, shoot-outs, trailing suspects in your various vintage cars, searching crime scenes, and role-playing detective work.  Also, I have to say that this game has, without a doubt, some excellent character animation.  The skins of the characters are based on real actors (some of whom you'll be sure to recognize from TV and movies) and the facial espressions, mannerisms, and body language of the in-game characters is suberb!The interrogation/questioning of suspects aspect of the game is, admittedly, a bit hard to learn, but once you get the hang of it it actually is one of the most interesting parts of the game.Oh, and about those vintage cars: They've also recreated an amazing rendition of late 1940s Los Angeles that you can cruise around  via your vehicle.  If you search around, you'll be able to find lots of interesting rides (rare sports cars, an ambulance, etc.).  I've thoroughly enjoyed taking cars that aren't mine and driving them to death, literally, by jumping off embankments, taking out mailboxes at 60mph, and other things we've all wanted to do with a car at some point.  By the time I'm done, my ride-of-the-day is a smoldering wreck on the side of the road.  Totally fun!Anyway, I haven't completed the game yet; I've played about 10 hours into it.  But so far, it's awesome.P.S. The DLC is totally worth it too, in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GAME WORKS FOR WINDOWS 10! CONFIRMED!HOWEVER!I only had one issue that made me restart the game.In one case, my character froze after observing a clue. The game still ran however, but I had to restart the game to resume my game.The game doesn't look too pretty due to poor PC Port. BUT, the game is still playable.The cases are rather difficult but has high replay value. The game is choopy at certain parts in the game. The cutscenes have some weird texture pop-ins at some points and character mouths get glitched.But this only happens sometimes. (1 out of every 4-5 Cutscenes) It doesn't make the game crash but I just need to point it out.Overall, 7-8/10 Depends if you hate 30 fps and wierd texture that occurs every so often. More of a movie than a game. But a damn good one!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, I'll try my best not to spoil anything (wrote review after I finished the ending credits):Waw, what a game. You're in for a rollercoaster that just gets faster and deeper the more you progress. In my opinion you should look at this game like you're participating actor in a very well done Noir series that could air on TV any day.For a 2011 game it also still looks pretty great on full detail, the score and soundtrack is well done, suited to the era and atmosphere of the game. Cinematography feels like a movie too.A few tips for people who are diehard about the story though:- Take some time to see the town, you'd be surprised what you find.- Learn from your mistakes, don't use wikia unless absolutely necessary or if you want that 5star rating on your 2nd try.- It's an 18+ game for a reason, respect that while you play it. Some scenes really can be shocking for some people, so take it as a warning.As conclusion (it's almost impossible to tell anything about this game without spoiling it), get it. If you fancy the era, the music, the detective genre, the noir genre, if you like puzzles, storytelling, if you like environmental accuracy or just like retro/vintage in general......get this game! You won't be dissapointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An underrated gem.L.A Noire is an open world adventure game where you play the role of take no♥♥♥♥♥♥detective Cole Phelps in 1940's Los Angeles. The gameplay mostly revolves around investigating crime scenes for clues and scenes where you interrogate suspects and try to decided weather they're telling the truth or if they're full of crap.The awesome thing about this game is the highly detailed and lifelike facial motion capture on the characters. It's so detailed that you're not watching pre-rendered animations, you're actually watching performances by actors and it's pretty amazing to see. The game world is immaculately detailed and a joy to cruise around and experience.I loved this game and I hope you will too because it needs a sequel ASAP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. In its entirety it’s intriguing and different.I like the detail put into it. In most games simple unimportant characters don’t really have a face of their own, they just use the same few models. (E.g. the citizens in Half-Life 2) but in this, every character has their own face and therefore their own identity, and I really liked that. They were all built around their voice actors and it was really amazing to see 3 or 4 actors that I knew of, appear in a video game. That was something that really did impress me.It’s mainly a detective type game, and there is a lot more action to it than your average detective game. You get to drive around an open world city responding to street crime, be involved in car chases, find clues for your investigation and interrogate your subjects making sure you judge them right.I only have one problem with this game and that’s the storyline. It isn’t exactly a “game breaker” for me, I just found it a little disappointing. At first I was extremely intrigued with the plot and it felt like it was going to go somewhere great and be really good, but it just wasn’t. I found it very up and down, it leads up to one thing then completely changes the subject.At the end of every mission you are given a score as to how well you did, and there are some points where you can’t avoid doing the wrong thing, which I thought was really stupid. There’s even one part you get told off for doing the right thing! I just thought that it was all over the place when it came to plotline.Apart from that I think this game is great, it’s a lot of fun and it’s not something you see all that often.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To resume L.A. Noire quickly, it's the story of a LAPD cop named Cole Phelps and his rise & fall in the police system, all while questioning a bunch of people about various crimes. This game manages to immerse you into the past, in the late 40's as a LA police officer trying to climb the ladder.I like alot of things about this game: The ambience, the music, the facial system, the captivating storyline, the relevance of almost everything placed in the decor, the dialogue, etc, and the list goes on. Rockstar/Team Bondi (R.I.P.) have done an amazing job on this game, making sure to create a different feel than in their previous games (such as Bully or GTA). There is no other game like this one, and that's a quality I love when it comes to good games.The story will run you at the very minimum at least 26 hours (DLC included) and you can then retry past cases individually to try and get better. I like to play through L.A. Noire about once every 1/1,5 years (it's kinda like a movie, where it's as enjoyable as the first time once you let some time pass and come back to it).I would recommend getting the complete edition of this game to any fan of Noire TV series or movies, and fans of well scripted detective games. DO NOT come into L.A. Noire expecting exactly the same as GTA but as a cop in the 40's because you will be very dissapointed. That being said, the game is amazing, probably the most immersive game i've played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game.  Always enjoyed detective movies/shows, so getting this is a no-brainier.  Worth playing; Recommend getting the ""complete"" edition if if gets on sale (usually only a few bucks more than base) and it comes with a few more missions and such. Music: It has some good '40's music playing on radios, but when you drive it's just soundtrack (shame i know) But the OST is still good regardless. Would like to hear some music while I just drive around. - 8.5/10Graphics: Facial animation is stunning. The lengths they've gone to; amazing. 30fps cap. 9/10Story: The more you play, the better it gets. You get flashbacks of Detective Cole back in the war after every few cases, and reading newspapers will give you back-story on ""current events"" (or something)  9-ish/10  Plot twists on your plot twists.Driving: I don't like it. Too sensitive for me. Tap directional key and the car moves across the street. No mouse steering. No in-car radio. When driving it's always the background music. (shame). No drive-and-shoot (Your a detective with common sense. That's why.)  5/10 - Average, could be better.   -- Reckless driving will give you a lower end-case rating. so don't cause city/personal damage - This isn't GTA. You're a traffic cop gone detective. A man of the law.  -- You can always hold ""E"" to let your partner drive to the location selected (if there are case-related dialogue; that will be said, then loading screen then you'll be at the location; with you behind the wheel.  - If there are car chases, you'd have to drive no matter what.World and level designs: the city is giant. Streets seem well done with placement of names, ads, and such that is realistic.The main map has almost every street on it, so when dispatch says ""on the corner of this and that"" you check the map and see what streets to take (there's no on-road line to see where to go) 9/10- The buildings are well made, with loads of clutter of personal items like photos that make it seem like there's someone living in there.- Only enter buildings with a Golden doorknob. So don't know what floor the perp is on? look for the golden doorknob. - The cars, buildings, clothes, even some speech is something from the '40/'50s - Devs captured it perfectly.Overall: 9/10 - Play now.TL;DR: Buy this game. Sale or full, get it. Worth every cent.  Good luck detective.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LA Noire is a detective game published by Rockstar and Bondi. It has some adaptations from the GTA series but they are not as large. One of them is a funny one, in GTA you were stealing cars, in LA Noire you can get inside any car by just stopping them and entering. It is developed by Rockstar so you'll have to deal with Rockstar Social club which can end in save file corrupting, losing accounts and things among those lines.The game is set in Los Angeles, as you might have guessed by the title, right after World War II. As our main character Cole Phelps, is an ex-marine, this opens up for some WW2 flashblacks and some returning co-marines that are connected to Cole. LA allows for a big setting for a game and you can also opt for a Black and white mode which is definitly as beautiful as with colours. Unfortunately the problem with a big city as big as LA is that it can lag quite a lot rendering parts of the map which makes driving not always as smootly. The music is a mixture of investigation music or music from shootouts which is the same the whole game and whenever you driving you can enjoy songs from that time mostly popular ones. If you are into that kind of music or heard such music before you'll recognise a lot of songs. The story is more the character trying to redeem himself from the actions he done in the war with a sad ending. I think the sad ending made the main character shine even more because he didn't get the respect he deserved for a big part of the game. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, although theres one part that I really found unnecessary. The demotion from Vice to Arson was pretty uncalled for, okay I agree, cheating on your wife is pretty bad. But that shouldn't get in the way of your career. I think it would've been better if they put Arson before Ad Vice and worked the ending out there. Ad vice had to do a lot with the army surplus morphine that had been stolen. It could've easily worked too.The gameplay is worked out very well, the work fits right into the setting and the cases are very good overall. The work you do in this game is detective work, which means you'll be solving cases. Or when you don't want to for a while you can solve street crimes. Before each case, at least in most of them, you get shown a cutscene showing us how the crime happened without showing faces and giving clear clues away. In the cases themselfs you find clues to help solve your case, requires you to sometimes brawl or shoot your suspects. Brawling in this game is amazing it feels like a boxing game. You sometimes also have to chase suspects or how they call it in this game subduing. It is a very bland objective since sometimes shooting in the foot doesn't fail the case for killing them and sometimes it does kill them. You are on thin ice trying to shoot a suspect you are chasing because it is not clear if it is allowed. In the cases you also get help from a partner depending on what desk you are in, I'll be mentioning the different partners and desks later. Whenever you are driving with the partner it starts a conversation with them about the case giving you side information or their insight. You could also use them as a sort of GPS. Do remind yourself that once you choose to reveal a new side mission that the partner will direct towards that. You also get to question your suspects which is for me the best part of the game. They have really spent an amount of detail to the facial expressions in an interview although the mouth may go out of synch with the voice sometimes. You have three options after you asked your question, whetether you believe him or doubt him or believe that he is straight up lying. You can recognise in the facial expressions in the small details what direction it is going in although making out a doubt from a lie depends how much you have progressed in the case and how much you can charge against him. When you are finished you get shown a case reports with the amount of clues you found and the amount of questions you have done correctly. Aside from that and the rating, in stars, you get some side information sometimes revealing what you missed.Desks:Patrol is the standard police work before we get a real taste of the detective work. This is mainly an overextended interactive tutorial more meant to show us the ropes of the game and to intrest us in the rest of the game. It also makes us more acquaintanced with the main character. Traffic surprised me more or less. If you do not know what Traffic means in cop terms, it mainly is about solving hit and runs. What surprised me that every case contained the hit and run with that little element extra what didn't make an ordinary hit and run. In Traffic you get partnered with Stephen Bekowski. He is a pretty rookie cop in the Traffic department but so are you so you learn a lot from each other making it both to Homicide eventually.Homicide is probably the longest rank you have in the game. It is twice as long as any other desk in terms of cases, unless you count the DLC cases, and the missions themself are also longer compared to Traffic. Homicide is researching and solving murders. I like how they managed the endings of the cases, giving the player an open ending, and also the question if you did the cases right. The open endings made the final case even better which was mainly designed around missing clues from other cases and most of the landmarks in LA. You get partnered up with Rusty Galloway in Homicide. He is a good cop who can't wait on his pension and he expresses that most of the time. The conversations about the cases were definitly the most interesting in the game since it was more a discussion which made me doubt too. Ad Vice is trying to stop the drug empire from happening. The Ad vice story itself is pretty short, again without DLC, but the cases are pretty lengthy on themselfs. The surprise to me whas the shoot first then ask questions later mentality in this desk. Which made it more exciting, I also think the drug empire in this game is pretty interesting how it works. They also connect with Cole his backstory , his time in the war as a marine, giving a chance to see most of the ex-marines back again. Roy Earle is impressed by your work in Homicide that's why he pulls you over to Ad Vice to be his partner. Roy Earle is a detective we already met an Homicide case and I didn't like him then and I still don't like him. He is by a landslide my least favourite parnet in any game with a buddy system. He thinks the only way to solve things is by being rude and aggressive. He does know the drug community inside out and teaches us a lot about that and also how the LAPD really operates. Arson desk is the solving of domestic fires and finding out how they happened. These cases are only meant to connect with the ending so that all the pieces fit togheter. I wouldn't mind that they had added some extra, non-DLC, but I like the appearance of the ex-marines again and the whole scandal around them. I also like that Cole isn't the only one investigating in this desk, what I mean with that will be clear once you play this desk fully. You get partnered with Herschel Biggs in Arson. Herschel has been in the war too but not the second one, which gives you an idea of how old he is at the time. Herschel is a very grumpy character but he is the only one who would never question a decision made by Cole without helping him in any way. That is how a partner needs to be. What I missed with Herschel is the conversations, they are there but very short.LA Noire is in my eyes a must pick up, if you love the setting of the 1940-1950's America with the classic detective with interactive cases which are sometimes pretty confusing to solve. I do not know if the DLC's are worth picking up, can't wait to find out for myself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those that remember and loved the Police Quest games this one is up your ally.  La Noire lets you find clues, question suspects, do crazy car chases and lots of shoot'em ups with the bad guys.The game engine used for this game is massive!!  There are so many streets to drive place to see, that doing all the 21 mission (DLC included) will not let you experience the whole map of L.A.  What is also nice is the small little details in the game.  The radio music playing while your drive or the news broadcasts are specific to the time of the game.  The cars also all handle differently from each other.On the hunt for some of the collectibles in the game I left my partner behind, after stopping in another part of the city a black and white police car stopped sirens blaring.  My partner got out and had some choice words for me leaving him behind.  This brings me to the voice acting which is really good for a game on this scale.  The small talk between your character and you partner on the specific desk can be a times really amusing.The annoying parts of the game are 2 achievements that you need to get to complete the game 100%.  One is the hunt for the golden films reels and the other is driving all the 95 vehicles in the game.  The film reels are movies related to the time, but they are hidden in such places that you will never find them during normal game play.  A quick Google will net you clues and maps to where all the golden film reels are.  The other pain is driving all the vechiles in the game. :(  This took me a couple of days to complete.  In the end I found a site that made it easier to get some of the vehicles.  For this you need to go to the Extras in the Main Menu, then the vehicle show room.  Move to the blacked out vechile and press ENTER for about 20 seconds. Escape to the Main Menu again and go to Cases and Select the Homocide Desk (Free Roam).  As soon as the map is loaded get out of the car and you will see the car that you need drive by.  For this you will need to Google to find a picture of the car needed.  If the car does not drive by check the parking lot across from the police station to see if it is there.  Some of the cars are mission specific and will only be found in certain missions or street crimes.  This will also only work for the 2 door and 4 door types of cars.All in all this is an amazing game.  If you follow your clues and check your suspects facial expression you may become a top rated detective.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imagine if you wanted to play Sherlock Holmes, but instead of solving crimes set centuries ago, you substitute it with a living real-world city from the modern era, put amazing attention to detail into everything, gameplay that somehow manages to overshadow firefight sequences by a longshot AND a character with a relatable dedication to his work paired with an interesting subplot, and you've gotten L.A. Noire.The gameplay keeps me invested to a degree which I find awe inducing for such a game. I'm usually not into detective/murder mistery type games because it tends to be boring point-and-click gameplay with uninteresting writing that doesn't really reach out to me in any way.On the other hand, this game caught my eye with its fresh take on the genre, as Rockstar and Team Bondi spent a good amount of time doing research on the reality of criminal investigation of this era and while not exactly simulating real gunplay, is a fun experience that really feels grounded in reality.This doesn't exactly make it the kind of game you could play in short bursts, but rather something you wanna stretch out as with what most Rockstar DEVELOPED games tend to do. Even though this was developed by Team Bondi, I dare say it beats the production values of Rockstar titles of the time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A Noire takes you back to 1940's Los Angeles where corruption and drugs are everyday business.In this game you follow young ex-militairy Cole Phelps, who after winning several awards for his actions during the war signed up for the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department)The game allows you to solve crimes with, or sometimes without a partner. While investigating for example a murder you have the option to question a witness, by paying close attention to their facial expressions or eye movement you can find out if they're either lying or telling the truth. Its exciting storyline and character developement is what makes this game such a masterpiece.As you follow Cole's career from Traffic to Homicide to Vice to Arson you get the feeling of being in a 1940's crime movie. Authentic clothing and infrastructure support this feeling. The game also allows you to free-roam, which makes it possible to drive around the city with your partner (Partner depends on what desk you chose) and respond to calls you get from the police radio. This game could just as well be a book because of its tensive storyline and fascinating character development.Overall I would give this game a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A Noire is a game that i surely recommend, it put you in the shoes of a young patrol police man and, who is gonna be soon one of the most famous detectives of L.A city.this game is abit of open world still it have it own nartives, you cant do alot in that world but still there is some side missions and you can recieve callup during your playtime to do some extra jobs and missions.the game is very special in this category, and combine alot of elements into a one game.the tech of facial expression to is very worm addition to the game it self and give alot to the gameplay.8.7\10 a great peace of art.

												As good as the game itself is, you're better off buying it on a console.  The PC version of this game has been optimized incredibly poorly, and even the most high-end system will have trouble getting a playable framerate out of it.  My own rig, while not the best, should be able to play this with reasonable settings at at least 30 frames per second, but I'm lucky to get 5 while keeping the camera pointed at the ground.  Give the PC version of this a pass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's a fully atmospheric experience of unpredicable events which will keep you immersed while playing, surprise you with the protagonist's difficult and shocking past, and simply - make you addicted to the game. As dark, attention drawing, and full of violence this game is, its riddles will leave you impressed with the story's complexity and depth at almost every turn.After almost six years since its release L.A.

												The game is not the newest anymore and probably got plenty of reviews so I will try to be brief:The game is set in 1947 Los Angeles and I do really enjoy the setting and the story of the main charakter as well as the story of the cases you have to solve are quite deep and interesting. ( I wont say much about it because I dont intent to spoiler).The Missions are very well developed. You have to question suspects and pay attention for example in which order you ask questions or which evidences you provide. You have to check if you can dig up more evidence by visiting different people or points of interest, find information on places murderes happend or find information in letters, written orders or other types of papers. You often question people and either decide if they lie, tell the trueth or seem suspicious which you can tell by their facial expressions. (If they hide something they will often try to avoid looking at your or into your face and search the room with their eyes). There are shootings happening frequently. The side missions are often based on catching someone escaping from a crime scene or even shooting down all oponents. You can use their guns. Aiming and taking cover is similiar to  GTAV. So action is present in the game as too and balances it very well.It is very fun even if you fail in most cases you still will move on with the story but get less points by setting up wrong evidence or accuse them of a lie while they spoke the trueth to you. There arent many games that combine those features with an open world and an interesting story.The open world is interesting too since all the cars and environments are set in the last century. Do not expect a GTA V of course, The game is made in 2011 and the traffic AI is horrible in fact you can try to drive perfectly and the AI will simply ram you off if they want to switch the lanes.The environment is set in LA only and you cannot really leave the city. You can visit some real life landmarks, especially the train station is very nice as you can see incomming and leaving trains but sadly its also a bit glitched.There are no different radio stations which is a bit of a downer too. The city is very alive and you in fact are able to look into the different shops and even enter many houses and buildings.The pedestrians however act funny too. You should avoid to run them over since you are a cop you get a message you shall protect civillians and not bring them into danger. In fact you even can lose points if you do continue bad behavior.Another thing I personally dislike is the social club login. You always have to keep signing in but in LA Noire it simply wont save my account data and I regularyly have to retype it to be able to start the game.I payed 5 Euroes and 99 cents but the game was completely worth it. I enjoy it a lot and since you can handle the missions very differently, there is quite some replay value as well if you wanna keep puzzling on a perfect score.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for an action based game, this isn't it.That said, if you're a fan of plot-driven, detective-work based adventure games of yore, THIS IS YOUR FIX.The game has a massive fanbase in Japan for essentially being a visual novel with a sandbox framework, and it shows in both writing and execution.The only real downside I can think of is the uncanny valley potential (very large here), the fact that the sandbox is underutilized unless you go on many of the sidequests for collectables, and as a whole the plot escalation being a basic snowball in pace.In any case, a must buy for the complete version, and a major ""wait for a sale"" if you are focused on action moreso than anything else.

												A really good game, i even play it today in 2017. The Facial Work is amazing and the graphics are not too bad to be made in the time it was made. All in general if you like Murder Mysteries and Solving Mysteries in General, its a game for you! a game where you get the 60-70 ies feel when you play, The map aswell is really cool aswell there is real name of cars (i think) Instead what GTA  or other Rockstar games have had, they have had custom names to everything, it kinda was changed here, there are tons of details like what gun the killer used aswell, i tried googling the gun in one of the missions and it was correct :) All in all a really well put togheter game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unusual, original and exciting yes yes this is exaclty L.A. NOIRE The main character of this game it's Cole Phelps veteran of the world war 2 with Japanese he returns to LA and begins work in police. L.A. Noire isn't all about badgering people, though. Remember it's not 100% sand-box . Of course we can travel in very big town , we've got almost 100 cars and 40 little missions ( if you want you can do , but if you dont want you dont need ) but the lvl of freedom it's like Mafia 2... and that's mean there is no freedom. The focus isn't on how good you are at scoring headshots with a pistol but instead your ability to read a suspect's face and determine if he or she is telling the truth etc. I have finished few times L.A. Noire and I never bored with this game . (Good game for study languages )Sounds  in this game are made very, very well The big minus of this game it's Physic , when you are driving a car it's like soap on the ice.  Of course your partner can drive from A to B  but I think it's better to drive around Los Angeles by yourself and see how beautiful is that town .In game we have few  Story Cases like : Patrol , Traffic , Homicide , Vice , Arson . PS. Game is really brutal , dont play childs , but im sure you will not listen me ... but plaese... dont fapp to killed naked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. gameplay 8/10  sounds 8/10 graphic 7/10 8/10Rockstar has done good job , game is very good 8/10 I recommends to play this game.

												A unique adventure game that borrows many features from mystery and action games, incorporating them seamlessly in the narrative flow, thus creating a truly special game that not everyone will enjoy. And that's because it has its own character, defying contemporary 'fast food' games that are churned out today and because it's reminiscent of endeavors made in another era, where immersion of an ultimate single-player experience was the first and last goal of their creators.

												The game is good. The gameplay is nice and all, but it feels very limited. The driving and walking physics are good, but climbing ladders, pipes, and going up fire escape stairs is very annoying. Hand-to-hand combat could've been much better.  No opinion on firing weapons, that was executed well. Driving physics are good, but car damage is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So are NPC's in vehicles. They will randomly crash into you, or stop in the middle of the road, causing you to crash into them. There's a variety of outfits, challenges (not cases) and vehicles. Now for the story part. Is it just me or does it feel that Phelps is a cop for like two weeks? I mean, he starts off as a patrolman in early 1947, and the game finishes in September '47. He goes trough the Patrol Desk in like a week, same goes for Traffic. And then there is this six month gap where he is in Burglary (cut content) and he is Homicide for another week before being in Vice.  Again, he's in Vice for a week, then he gets supsended for like a day and is already back in Arson the day after. Oh, and he has like two whole cases in there and you waste your time with the final mission just to get to see ""that"" ending. The cases that you get to play are good, so is the questioning of your P.O.I's. But yes, the only thing that annoys me is how short the game is. And, it always made me think why none of Cole's partners got promoted. Phelps solved ""The Fallen Idol"" with the help of Bekowsky, and Stefan stayed in Traffic. Phelps solved The Dahlia case with Galloway, and again, only Phelps got bumped to Vice (although trough a special request), but still Galloway deserved some sort of promotion. Other than all that, good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazingly written characters and face impression technology. Well executed type of detective gameplay. Personally I find it hard to achieve the perfect interrogation because of the fact that there is no easy way and you have to use your wits perfectly but still that is what makes the game unique in its own way. I would say checkpoints couldve been more but suppose this was better and more realistic.Recommended			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You will play as Phelps and will work your way up the ranks at the police station, you will go to crime scenes, investigate, drive, shoot people, catch serial killers. Whenever i watch a crime show i feel like i want to be evolved in solving the crimes, and in this game you get to do that you get to take control of the investigation.Definitely grab this when it's on sale.9.5/10A+			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Go get them Cole!L.A. Noire is in my opinion the perfect game. The perfect dose of action, suspense, story driven plot.We are given a ride thru the history of Cole Phelps. As he rises thru the ranks of the Police department, we get a history lesson has well a well paced travel into the human criminal mind. "" there is one case that makes a detective, the one that doesnt let you sleep at night."" This is the truth about this game. You deal with the ""normal"" crimes, robbery, murder, arson,etc. But nothing will prepare you for what lies further in the game. The graphic novelesk type story behind the insidious criminal mind that will remain a dark shadow while you play. Until you find out the truth. The vintage setting is just the iccing on top of this well rounded Cake. Worth it without a Doubt!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll keep it smooth and ordered:Pro:- REAL mimics. They used a technology where they basically filmed the actors face and put it into the game. No animations, no face capture, you see real people there. That is the main selling point - at least for me - of the game because no other game used this since then. It is very expensive, that is why. - REAL(istic) movements. The motion capture worked really well, I rarely see this detailed animations. - Interesting cases. They're small full stories in themselves, but most of them somehow connects to the bigger picture. You start the game as a patrol, then as you move forward you became a detective. You solve cases at each different desk, but you only start to get the picture after half of the game. - Good main story. It is beliveable, the characters are detailed, such as their motivations. The plot twist impressed me. - I'd say nice cars as well, but that isn't a big thing to do these days. Contra:- Repetitive investigating. You use the same techniques and scripted animations over and over. - Also repetitive street crimes. Car chases, thefts and shootings. These were the three main types. Some were interesting though.- Annoying sound bugs. Had to restart the last mission from the beginning because couldn't heard sh*t from the last cutscene. - 30 FPS lock. And it drops below 24 even on a strong config. This is a smart game. The developers outdone themselves with the whole facial expression and mocap feature, but they didn't put as much emphasis on important things as they should have. My 27 hours playtime felt like 40 because I got bored many times during it. Still can't dislike it, if it's on sale go and buy it. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story was wonderful.  I really thought that Cole was going to be this cookie cutter, always a goody two shoes (and very boring) kind of guy.  And while he does start off like that, Cole goes through some massive character development, as he starts realizing that the police had some seriously corrupt individuals running the show.  This game does touch on some sensitive issues, so if you have issues dealing with things like♥♥♥♥♥♥and child molestation, AVOID THIS GAME.  Granted, it is not the main part of the storyline, but you do run across those acts a few times during the entirety of the game.  Oh and don't forget that this is a noir game.  Keep that in mind and maybe you won't be tempted to take your comp out back and give it a beatdown when you finally hit the end. When the game told me I need to watch the face of the person I am questioning to see if they are sincere or not, I shook my head.  Great, here is another game that is going to ask you to do something damn near impossible.  I will admit that there are some, where you will need to listen to the voice as well as watch their face, but you should do that no matter what.  I will say this.  I did mute the volume just to see if I could read lips, and they were pretty readable.  One word of caution... if you suck at driving cars like I do, have your partners drive.  I realize that achievement hunters will have to manually control the car (which I did too... but let's just say some roads looked a lot like a tornado had blown through and car parts were everywhere).If you like crime games, noir, open world, lots of guns, cars, an excellent storyline with a great cast of actors... just get this game.   20 bucks is a good price, but if you see it on sale do yourself a favor and pick it up.  You'll be glad that you did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is a real gem of my game library! It has everything I've ever wished for in detective games: * Open world with 95 vehicles you can drive. There is an Auto Fanatic achievement for starting engine of all vehicles available in the game at least once. Searching for more cars in game made me look at cars parked along sidewalks irl and think if they are those which are missing ;) * Wide variety of cases to solve under different departments of the police institute. It successfully prevents the game from being too repetitive and you get new partners to work on cases with. * Action! You will chase criminals and suspects on foot or in a vehicle. Combat involves both fist and gun fighting depends on a situation. But you must fight appropriately back or your mission will fail and you will have to start over. Weapons can only be used during firefights. If you can't successfully finish an action mission, the game will offer you to simply skip it and move on after the 3rd try. I think that's a great deal for people who are more interested in the story than in the challenges. * Many dialogues, questioning, truth, doubt and lie choices, great face mimic. * Nice graphics, attention to the detail, great voice acting. * You get to play character who's personality you learn more about through his behaviour, conversations and flashbacks of his past. You will find out he is a person who makes mistakes and who sure has skeletons in his closet.. It's pretty amazing how complex his personality is. I really like the twists we are getting there. I must say, don't let the 30 fps cap scare you away from one of the greatest detective games. You can easily fix it and increase it to 60.L.A. Noire is definitely worth of being finished. Towards the ending the game includes the most action scenes. Before that I used to play it when I wanted to relax after a hard day at work. Then things escalated and the story got a fast speed untill it reached the typical noire fiction ending.I really recommend the game from the bottom of my heart. Go for it :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I did some research on reviews for the game and one of my most trusted sources (GameSpot) gave the game a 9 - Superb and I decided to purchase it and try it.The game has performed pretty smooth so far and the graphics are good, but the atmosphere and visual depiction of Los Angeles is fantastic! The story line and voice acting is very good and quite absorbing. I've never been a big fan of crime detective adventure mysteries but this game has changed all that...I'm hooked, at least for L.A. Noire. The keyboard (you can customize) and mouse controls take a bit of practice but then it flows quite well.The downside (which is very insignificant) is the auto saves, I'm not a fan of that but in a game like this that is probably the only option.I highly recommend this game, just be sure you have a computer that can handle it...I too give it a 9 out of 10!Patrick  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A new approach to the adventure genre. I‘m a fan of adventure games and i loved it. Of course the game is not perfect. I was amazed by the graphics when it came out on PS3 and purchased it. Now i bought it with all the DLC. Rockstar know how to make DLC, this is real DLC which adds about 8-9 hours of gameplay and the quality of DLC cases is great. It‘s integrated into the story cases and you can‘t even tell whether you‘re playing DLC or not.The facial animations still surprises me, i so want more games with similar technology. Wouldn‘t it be nice to se a walking dead game with such animations?The overall graphics is pretty good too. But the performance is not the strongest part of this game. The game is pretty old and the framerate is not very good. Of course i used the fix which unlocks 60fps it made the game better.Solving cases is fun, you search for the clues and talk to the witnesses and suspects and must decide if they‘re lying or not. The cases are different so it never gets boring. Story is very interesting too.It‘s an open world game but i really don‘t understand what’s the point of it. You have nothing to do except for story and side missions. The purpose of all that open map is only to drive from point A to point B.Anyway just grab this when you see it on sale, it‘s cheap now and is really worth it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good concept but flawed execution. The problem with creating a crime solving game, which Rockstar understands, is that the average gamer won't be able to do it. The compromise to what could have been a cool mystery/policing type game is that it ends up being more of a hand-holding simulator, where most of the stuff is done for you. It's really trivial to do everything right because the game does so much by itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me preface this by saying: I did not expect GTA: 1940. I was told this was a puzzle game with some movie-like noir elements.That was wrong. L.A. Noire is a boredom factory. You push some buttons, you look around, you click through some dialogue and out comes the snores. The game is simple, the action sequences are usually holding the shift button as you jump over fences and short walls and other manners of game props while chasing a bad guy, and the 'puzzle' elements involve looking for one of the many shiny clue objects in a scene (there isn't even any clutter to complicate things, the console effect means that even in supposedly hectic scenes like a recently trashed apartment there are only a few interact-able props, which the main character will almost immediately tell you “isn't relevant to the investigation”) or walking around a room until a piano note sounds, then pressing a button and rotating an object to get the moron detective to look at all 4 sides of a knife before deciding it could be a murder weapon. No matter what you choose from the dialogue branches, the main character shoots off in whatever direction he fancies, so any immersion into the supposed movie atmosphere of the game is broken every time it prompts you for input because the talking heads have no flow to their discussion.“Stick with it”, they cry, “the later cases get pretty good!”Hogwash. It felt like a chore slogging through every single mission, at no point was I having fun. The stories aren't compelling, the gameplay isn't exciting, the puzzles aren't puzzles, and above all the voice acted dialogue sequences are an agony to sit through (not because of the voice acting, which is average at its worst). Pass, pass ten thousand times. I would rather play a real puzzle game, a visual novel, or an action game. L.A. Noire tries to do some mashup of all three and comes out a pile of turds. I think somebody accidentally released a facial emotion tech demo.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is a violent crime thriller that blends breathtaking action with true detective work to deliver an unprecedented interactive experience and follows the story of Cole Phelps, an ex-military and LAPD detective trying to climb in the ranks while fighting corruption and all-time high murder rates back in the 40's Los Angeles.L.A. Noire is a such a unique adventure game that borrows many features from mystery and action games, incorporating them seamlessly in the narrative flow, creating a truly special game.There's a wide array of vehicles and cases to solve under different departments, suspects to chase, either on foot or while driving and suspects in custody to interrogate.The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is pretty good, the soundtrack and voice acting are marvelous but what really makes this game a masterpiece is the astonishing and engaging story and the character development.I highly recommend L.A. Noire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rockstar has a lot of issues with their Social Club... but don't let that put you off this gem of a game. The rendering of 1940's L.A. is fantastic, and if it were a game for just a driving tour of the city, it would be worth buying for that element alone. The story is engrossing, if not quite completely fleshed out, and the character development and interactions with NPCs give the narrative a great flavor of the period.I just loved exploring the city. The cases and the whole ""playing the detective"" gameplay is well developed, if somewhat tricky (I had a hard time ""reading"" people to judge if they were lying, being evasive or telling the truth). I played the game ""noir style"" in black and white, and generally had no problems identifying clues despite the lack of color contrast.I got 60 hours of gameplay in my first playthrough and there is still tons of exploration to do. Would I play through the story again? Yes, emphatically. So I think the game is worth a look in, if you are still making up your mind. If anything, I was disappointed that the game ended (but also a little surprised by how abruptly it ended: NO SPOILERS). Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only a couple hours in, and I am completely amazed by this game. The facial details in this game are unparalleled (even for a 2011 game), even though sometimes the character's facial movements/expressions do not help you in interrogation. The story is also not completely erratic like others, yet keeps you on track enough just to keep you coming back for more. However, the game is not without it's flaws. Tasks such as running and gunning while goons are unloading whole mags on you feels a bit unresponsive at times, and I've had some minor graphical glitches dealing with character's heads at times. Overall, it is a really good game, and I would recommend for anybody who likes a good mystery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Perhaps this is the most exciting game in the genre. Atmosphere Los Angeles assigned incredibly accurate. Detailing and facial expressions of characters is so good that sometimes it seems that it is a movie. Good movie in HD. The plot is captures and a few hours of play already begins to seem that you yourself detective.  In this game you need to really think a head to look at the character's face and facial expressions to detect a lie or telling the truth. That dialogue at the highest level.Despite the fact that it is such a GTA game, I recommend it to all fans of this genre because there is something to all of us and a favorite of the Mafia.10 out of 10!

												When this first came out, the first thing that came across my mind was Mafia II. And let me tell you, I like Mafia II a lot. So I thought this would be just a Mafia rip-off with only difference being the protagonist. Not a gangster, but a cop. Graphics looked similar, fighting system looked pretty  much the same and the setting was very similar too. But that was just me judging by simply looking at trailers. The differences are actually major.Later I received this game as a gift from my friend and, to be honest, I was quite impressed. That was after I managed to run it properly though. The game was rather choppy at first (which didn't suprise me since it was a well-known fact). I must admit I didn't even need to change too many things to make it playable. I probably got lucky.But enough of that, let's see what the game has to offer.Graphics is nice and the city this game takes place in, Los Angeles, is huge. It's very detailed and despite the impressive scale there are hardly any bugs. You'll find many types of cars and many character models with different textures. Almost everybody knows about the famous face expressions in this game. And yes, they did a good job with it, even though some people look more scary than real. I wouldn't call it a huge help during interviews with suspects either, because LA seems to mostly consist of professional liars. But don't get me wrong, it's a nice feature.Another good thing about this game is the music. And not only the score that puts you into right mood, but also great hits of the 1940's you will hear in the radio. Voice acting is provided by the same persons whose faces you actually see in the game, so the whole thing feels authentic. Sounds of weapons, cars and the city are your normal average sounds.Gameplay takes some time to get used to, but it's not bad. Walking, driving, shooting... You'll learn all that quickly. Then we have the other stuff that makes this game special. That means searching for clues and interviews. It might seem little confusing at the beginning, but there's a whole chapter of tutorial that also serves as an introduction for out protagonist - disciplined police go-getter named Cole Phelps. Sooner or later searching for clues will become a routine for you and you'll eventually get better at interviews. Those are made well too. You can either believe the suspect, doubt them or even accuse them of lying. But be careful! You must use correct clues to prove they're lying to you.And then we have the story. Is it good? Hard to say. It's mostly just cases to solve with a flashback cutscene from the war every now and then. Later in the game, Cole's personal life will get more space, but I won't be spoiling.I can absolutely recommend this game, even though there might be problems running it properly and you might need to find some tips on how to make it run smoother. Some cases are brilliant, some are annoying, but that's what life itself is like, so why not? Overall it's a great experience with lots of interesting stuff. In many ways unique too.

												L.A. Noire, why are you so entertaining and so disappointing at the same time?L.A. Noire is mostly the story of Cole Phelps, a former-marine-now-policeman working in the Angels' city. As such, he will have to work his way up the food chain, starting in patrol, soon to be promoted to trafic, homicide and what not.The game is a mix and match of several genres: it's a bit of a point n' click, but with third-person shooting and driving around, in a beautifully recreated L.A. Mostly, you'll be collecting clues on crime scenes, and interviewing suspects, while a partner lets you do all the work and comments on your action.Those parts are great. Thanks to some fancy facial-capture technology and the help of professional actors, the characters of L.A. Noire feel alive, and real. You can see their expression on their faces, notice when they tell the truth or when they lie (in which case you gotta shove a clue you collected into their face). Coles Phelps yells, gets mad, doubts... In a very convincing way. The cast includes many well-know series actors, from Madmen, Breaking Bad or Twin Peaks.What's more, the shooting parts (relatively frequent) aren't that bad, for an investigation game.But L.A. Noire's greatest success is its wonderful film noire atmosphere. Secret loves, murders, illegal gamblings, corrupted politicians and cops, jazz, femmes fatales... Everything is right here, in a post-WW2 US. A country that feels invincible, but whose confidence hides nasty stories.Great, heh?Yeah, except that L.A. Noire also disappoints. If you don't stick to the cases you're supposed to be solving, you quickly find out its greatest weakness: Los Angeles has no soul. The city is beautiful, mind you. But nothing happens. Car drives around, people walk. There are a few scripted events. But that's about it. You can't drive around and tail someone just because he looks weird. The game has to tell you to do it. You can't get into a restaurant a get yourself a coffee and read the news. You can't discuss with people. The city feels like a beautiful, but empty playground.If you're expecting a game that looks and plays like Gran Theft Auto, let's say you might be turned off by L.A. Noire. The game has little in common with Rockstar' behemoth. But if you like the film noire genre, and are willing to put up with sometimes clunky or repetitive gameplay, then you ought to try L.A. Noire. I personnally see the game as an interactive story (a bit like The Walking Dead), taking place in an open world where you can drive fancy old cars. Too bad the game could have been so much more.

												Before I start my review let me tell you the L.A. Noire is NOT the easiest game to get running smoothly. Here's what I did and it ran great on my modest Win 7 64 Bit machine. When the launch screen comes up go to Options and in the command line copy and paste ""-npd -str -nonv"" (without the quotes) into the box. Turn ""Ambient Occlusion"" off and ""Threading"" to Single. Hopefully that helps. Now. With that said, I found L.A. Noire to be a gift from Heaven. I'm a huge fan of Raymond Chandler and his stories of Private Detective Philip Marlowe swimming through the seedy side of early Los Angeles with every case. L.A. Noire has you patrolling those very streets and solving cases involving sex, drugs, murder and corruption. The major crimes found in L.A. Noire are based on real life crimes and the streets of Los Angeles circa the late 40s have been painstakingly recreated to colorful perfection. You're rewarded for oberservational skills both in clue hunting and during the interview and interrogation portions. There is tons to do whether you want to look for landmarks, well hidden bonus items or one of the 40 ""street crime"" mini-missions that you can elect to take between calls. I really liked the facial motion capture which gave each character more personality. The acting is superb and loaded with recognizable character actors like John Noble, Michael Wiles & Kurt Fuller. Gunplay and driving is as easy as what you'll find in a GTA game. Now is it perfect? No. The port is not very good. From what I understand it's a pain to run even on a beefy PC. The street crime mini missions are very short and there are times you'll be driving a while to get to them.  Overall, L.A. Noire gets a 9.5/10 from me. If you're looking for a lengthy, well told story with excellent voice acting and game play then hit ""install"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. Okay, wait, let's get the bad out of the way first.1) It's optimized poorly. The game seemingly started fine, or perhaps I was too enamored with the city to notice, but DX9 or DX11, highest settings or lowest, nothing mattered. The camera would stutter, the engine would slow, and otherwise damage the otherwise breathtaking aesthetics of L.A. Noire.2) The driver and pedestrian A.I. is atrocious. For a game that forces you to spend the majority of your time driving, expect to laugh at the ridiculous decisions made by the NPCs in this game. Then, when chasing down suspects or trying to avoid... well, I won't spoil anything, but let's just say at certain points, you will yell at the television for these dummies to get out of the way.3) The action sequences aren't as interesting as the investigation ones. Basic action, such as the street crimes, or even a moderate shootout, aren't too bad but the above complaints tend to ruin any tension Team Bondi attempted to create.I think that's about it. So what did I like?1) The city. Sorry, Sleeping Dogs, you've been knocked off the top spot (previously owned by Saints Row 2) for best video game city. It's no wonder Team Bondi went bankrupt after this game. The amount of time and resources it must have taken to recreate Los Angeles is staggering.2) The characters. Thanks to stellar voice acting and the well-publicized facial animation engine, it's easy to forget you're playing a game and not watching a movie. Tip: Play L.A. Noire in black and white and the effect is even more staggering.3) The story. I'm a sucker for noir in general, and this is a pretty good tribute to the genre. That pretty much every single element is tied to the main story, no matter how minor it seems, is a nice touch.4) The investigation. Whether you're screaming at a widower -- er, I mean 'doubting' a widower -- or trying to figure out how a torn letter fits with the case, I enjoyed poking around the city's seedy underbelly and solving the (many!) mysteries.Note that I keep writing ""the city"" instead of ""the game."" Yes, it's that realistic.I loved L.A. Noire, and if you like mysteries and history at all, please don't hesitate picking up this game. Just be warned that even at 30 FPS, a computer that laughs at the recommended specs of the latest games will (probably) not run this smoothly. Fortunately, you'll probably be too engrossed to care. I know I was.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are playing this game, play it as a glorified movie, not like a videogame. In terms of gameplay and player agency, the things you can really do are limited. Once you get the hang of it, the lie detection system gets pretty easy too, and even if it's not, there's always the ability to reload previous saves for that perfect score.However, it still has a really good storyline and setting. Driving around the streets of an old LA make you live in a world we would usually see in black and white, and despite what I've said before, the way you can go around a case is what can make you go missing clues or being able to score a full score on the first try.Overall, check it out if it's on a steam sale, only if you want to see the story.

												This game was absolutely terrific. The gameplay consists of a series of well done cases. Murders, thefts, arsons, drug dealing and bank roberies are just the start. There are a lot of things to do in the city of Los Angeles. Full of life both at night and day, it's districts are beautiful and detailed. The music was extremely pleasing. Both atmospheric and intriguing. The cinematics made the game look like an 60's movie. In a good way of course. The main character is a very likable person. And everything you do, every mistake and success counts. It will influence on your investigation one way or another. The cases were Insanely twisted and interesting. I enjoyed the game's unique face capture thing. It felt so much realistic and professional. The developers did a great job, and their game deserves the best reviews from everyone that played it.10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want an open world crime solving game, then this is the only game around.Graphics: They are fairly decent to play and use. Nothing amazing but still very good for this game.Audio: The audio is semi basic, offering no major change to huge detailing. Just an open world crime and weird sounds. That's all. Controls: The character at times handles a little weird but that is the game and not the controls. Otherwise the controls are very easy to manage. Game: It is open world GTA but you are a police man case solver, that is it.There is supposed to be a feature that allows you to read the BOTS facial expression... YET THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME in ALL expressions. So how you are supposed to tell if they are lying is beyond me!The game story will be very short if you power that only.  It is wise to do the side missions aswell and collect the secrets etc as you play through the game.  Worth the time you put into it, but it is not amazing.Would I recommend this game? Yes because it's good fun and a nice chance of pace from modern games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So , I completed this game on 100% and I can finally write a review. What can this game offer?Well , in this game you are going to play as a detective Cole Phelps and watch not only how he is going up in his career but also how he is becoming a real hero.There are 5 desks to complete in this game : Patrol , Traffic , Homicide , Vice and Arson.Each of them contains ~5 cases (only Patrol has 4) and also 1 or 2 DLC cases.Both of default and DLC cases are very interesting. Each desk offers unique cases , for example in Traffic desk you will investigate crimes related with cars stealing and in Homicide you will investigate brutal murders.To feel like a real detective you'll need to collect evidence at crime scenes and also ask questions to suspects. You'll need to see if they are telling truth or lying and show one evidence to confirm that they are lying. Sometimes it's really hard to tell if person is lying and that's why there are ""Intuition""in this game. You are getting ""Intuition points"" while you are leveling up and use these points to see what have other players chosen.This can help a lot.There are a lot of things to collect in this game from hidden badges to cars.To fully understand plot you can pick up newspapers which you can easily find during main story. There are also flashbacks in the end of some cases. These flashbacks help you to see the past of Cole Phelps.This game has huge open world(almost a half of GTA V(or even more)). To move around quickly you can ask your partner to drive the car to the selected location. This can save a lot of time.In conclusion , I can't understand why almost everyone is upset with ending of this game. I think that the ending that we have would be the best option to end the game.One disadvantage of this game is that it's locked on 30FPS.So , this game is great , shall i say. It has a great story and spectacular gameplay which will make you play this game even after you have beate it.Although , without DLC cases this game may seem to be short so if you can afford DLC bundle - buy it.I can proudly give this game 9.5/10 (because I had some problems with it and saw some bugs)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're a fan of the 40ies era, crime scene investigations and narrative games then this is the perfect game for you!  BUY IT! Unfortunately the world in this game is limited to your detective duties and a few street crimes, as it would be suitable for a lot of open world playability, but it has even less sandboxing than Mafia II. So if you'd want an open sandbox world, you're out of luck and you'd be having more fun playing Mafia II with its DLC.However, all-in-all it's a great immersive game (awesome radio with real pieces of history!) that follows the career of Cole Phelps, an honest cop, freshly returned from WWII with the necessary traumas that he's trying to forget, while he's trying to solve murder cases. But there's more behind them than meets the eye....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A flawed masterpiece. The major issue is you have to read facial cues from people- and while it's easy enough to tell when someone is being honest, for some reason lies are split up into ""doubt"" and ""lie"" - which is ridiculous, and you usually act more hostile when you ""doubt"" than when you're sure it's a ""lie"". As a result you get all those questions wrong, which forces you to re-do some cases. So you go online for the solutions, which really just ruins the game.The city is fantastic, the characters are well-written, and the missions a fantastic progression. I just couldn't get myself to finish. It stopped being fun. Just driving around was awesome though. So close to being amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Technical developers made genocide over this game when they put 30FPS lock. I don't mind 30FPS,bigger problem for me is that 30 FPS are not stable,when i use alt+tab,or shift+tab,i always get annoying FPS drop,but with time,you get used to it. Also,graphic options are kinda lame-you can mostly choose between ''performance'' and ''quality''.Im active gamer for last 12 years,this game is top5 unique games i ever played.Mission are very interested,every mission in unique in some way,and also side mission are pretty cool...I would say map(which is Skyrim size) is to big for this kind of game. Another bad thing is that you can't kill pedestrians when you hit them witn car xD (althought,it's not reccomended since you'll get negative rating at the end of mission if you do so).I would also mention that this game have large number of (licenced) vehicles.If 60 FPS-i would give 8/10With 30 FPS - 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've not got too far into this game just yet, but for someone who struggles with a short attention span and very rarely sticks to and finishes a game, this has already got me hooked! I love the fact that you have so much control over the game, and having to choose the correct answer (Truth, Doubt or Lie) from reading their body language and facial expressions is really interesting to me and can completely change the game play. The storyline keeps me interested and for that to happen, it must be pretty good!Would definitely recommend. It may be quite slow paced to some, but I really enjoy it! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Facial expressions and acting are the best I've seen in a game, and the detective gameplay is simply genius making you try to figure out if someone is lying by watching their faces.

The 30fps cap doesn't bother me at all, this is not an action game.Only complaint is that the gameplay feels a bit clunky at times.

												Investigating thefts, robberies, disappearances and murders, all the while driving around in a huge city to get from site to site to gather clues and testimonies and, if you feel like it, respond to the occasional emergency dispatch calls (ranging from domestic disturbance to bank heist), that's what L.A. Noire is all about. Don't get fooled by the resemblance to GTA games. Yes there is a lot of driving around and some scenarios/street crimes involve shooting or fighting bad guys the same way but you'll spend more time confronting people with questioning than with your gun. Graphics are really nice and the animation...My jaw dropped the first time I saw a cutscene. The facial animation, especially, is so well done it makes you almost forget you're watching a game. This, combined with the top notch voice acting, brings the characters to life in a manner so believable you'll see actors, not computer generated dummies.  Music is also great and really suits the 40's era very well and helps to create the overall atmosphere. This one's worth buying. Still not sure? Wait until it's on sale then and get the complete edition with added scenarios.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There aren't many games in which you get to test your brains as well as as your hand-eye coordination in real world scenarios. Playing a detective could never be as much intriguing or fun as it was in L.A. Noire. The game mechanics are super cool, allowing the player to gauge the characters expressions and body language and based on that, assess whether they're lying, hiding something, or telling the truth. Although the game is fairly linear, it's very interesting to see how the decisions made affect each case. It would have been even more interesting if the entire story changed on the basis of those decisions, of course! Every gamer should definitely play this once.			",56,10,0,3,1,0,0

												Fantastic game. Facial expressions and acting are the best I've seen in a game, and the detective gameplay is simply genius making you try to figure out if someone is lying by watching their faces. The music and writing are excellent. The cases are really interesting so far. Graphics look a bit dated, but work very well. The 30fps cap doesn't bother me at all, this is not an action game.Only complaint is that the gameplay feels a bit clunky at times. The game feels much better with a controller than a k/m.Very recommended, tons of content, and high production values.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've played a game by Rockstar before, then you probably have a good idea of what to expect from L.A. Noire. It's a lot like GTA or Red Dead Redemption — third-person gunfights, car chases and hot pursuits on foot, well-developed characters, and a compelling storyline. It's a formula that may seem almost like a crutch with how often Rockstar employs it in their titles, but it's hard to complain when it's done well.If you're the type of person to play GTA for the plot, then L.A. Noire will keep your attention with relative ease. It does away with a lot of the nuisances that drag GTA down (there weren't even mobile phones for your cousin to call you on back in the 40's), but it also makes for — perhaps — a less substantial game, as there's not a whole lot to do besides follow the main storyline.You play as Cole Phelps, climbing the ranks of the L.A. Police Department, slowly uncovering a massive conspiracy that reaches all the way up to the highest officials in Los Angeles. By the end of the game, you'll have managed to collect evidence from nearly every other previous case, all pointing towards systematic corruption and foul-play.Knowing that he can bring the system crashing down is the ultimate goal that keeps Cole searching for the truth, but L.A. Noire manages to undo all player expectations with the game's finale. With an ending that nobody could possibly expect, L.A. Noire proves to be both the most shocking and most frustrating game I've played in a long time.As confused and angry as the ending will leave you feeling, I still recommend playing the game from beginning to almost-end and then maybe just making up the last mission in your head. L.A. Noire definitely wins the prize for having the biggest f•••-you ending that a game could possibly conceive, but it's still worth the time to try it out.			",172,32,3,12,18,1,26

												GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GAME. This game makes you think a ton because there's so much detective work and none of the evidence pieces together, so it's your job to find out who's lying and who's not. This game involves high speed car chases, epic gunfights, awesome graphics (for its time which was 2011,) great gameplay, a huge map, and tons of costumes with special powers. The only bad thing about this game is that there are about a bajillion startup problems you will go through after purchasing it, but i do believe they have fixed it because it works every time i want to play.  Aside from all the thousands of horrible things about windows 8.1, i would without a doubt reccomend this game to anyone who is interested in detective work, thinking hard, or even have the slightest interest in forensics because this game ROCKS!!!!

												Revolutionary game. For the first time ever you feel you are a true detective, solving crimes, climbing up the ranks. The retro feeling of the game is awesome, nice graphics, the game makes you feel that every case is a movie (like Colombo). The facial mimics are incredible, every twitch matters, it helps you decide wether the suspect is lying or not. I'm recommending this game to everyone who likes murder stories, the forties-fifties America. Only downside is that after a while the crimesolving gets a little dull, but it's nothing compared to everything else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire Review L.A. Noire is an intresting game, and very unlike other games and also like them all at the same time. You have your detective skills, questioning, unlike any other game, but you also have your car chases, shootouts, on foot chases, much like other games. One of the best things about L.A. Noire is that it skillfully uses these elements to create a consistent, cohesive, whole. L.A. Noire for me, helped me appreciate high production values used the right way. I believe the way L.A. Noire plays really makes it head and shoulder above many other games. L.A. Noire however doesn't come without faults. The procedural cases while engaging like, Law & Order, also get a little repetitive gameplay wise. After a couple of cases, you do the usual, find clues, investigate a place, interview witness' or suspects, and then chase the one your after. The case together though tell a great tale and it really is great especially if you are in to procedural dramas. The mo-cap system it uses is pretty darn amazing and the best I've seen yet. The performances really come through, although I would have loved for the directors, to come up with some more emotional cases or scenes, so we could really see how great this system is. About 20 or so hours in the game, you'll hit the Arson Desk, which provides some much needed reprieve from the usual procedings. I won't spoil it for you, but your entire time at the Arson Desk is unlike the other departments. At this point of the story L.A. Noire's plot really picks up and you start seeing the story threads all connect together, even threads that were started at the very beginning of the game. FOR: People who love noire, procedural dramas, and want to be a detective.NOT FOR: People who like fast paced gameplay, L.A. Noire has a slower pace than most games and it really starts to show about mid way. What probably doesn't help is the fact that it's about a 30 hour long game. While great for people who love this, it may not bode well for other with less patience. Nevertheless I suggest you buy the game, especially if it's on a Steam sale.			",555,84,35,64,16,3,34

												After 40 hours of gameplay time I have to say LA Noire is one of the most ambitious, most interesting and most exciting games I have played in recent years. Attention to detail is top-notch as we have already gotten used to it when it comes to a Rockstar game. But here this is more commendable as this is now a ""serious"" game - you follow the story of detective Phelps, an LAPD cop, who rises from being a simple patrolman to working with the best and most influential cops in the force. You quickly realise that there are people harder to catch out there - you start with the small fish only to find clues as to how to grab the biggest sharks in town.Gameplay-wise LA Noire is a bit different from GTA IV. The missions - or as they're referred to, cases - usually start out with a crime scene investigation. You get in a car and drive to your destination where you need to look for clues. Clues are objects you can interact with - once you approach one you'll hear a chime; this is how the game tells you that you can now press a button to grab the object in your vicinity. The more clues you find the more are added to your notebook. There is usually a witness around you can interview. And this is the 2nd most important thing in gameplay: interviewing means that while you can pick your questions from a list provided you also need to ""evaluate"" the suspects' responses. You have 3 options: you either believe what they are saying, you can remain in doubt or you can shout at them calling them liars. Picking the correct answer will make it easier for you to find and apprehend the real suspect. Make no mistake: if you are wrong it does not mean game over but it will affect the scoring at the end of your case. You should also note two more things: firstly, you can have help in the form of intuition points. The more crimes you solve the more experience points you get. Once you level up you gain an intuition point. These can be used to remove one of the 3 possible answers thereby increasing your chances to 50%.  Secondly, once you accuse someone of lying you need to prove that. Phelps immediately turns the page in his notebook to the list of evidences. You need to pick the right evidence to succeed (that is, if you have found enough clues for that to appear in your list).Interestingly, some of these conversations can be the most exciting and rewarding parts of the game. Rockstar employed a special motion capture technique which makes all faces and expressions as realistic as possible. In fact, you can see the faces of real life actors and actresses - those of you watching a lot of TV series will easily be able to recognise some of these. This also means that voice acting is provided by the same people and it is of equally high quality. Suspects not telling the truth usually look away, move their mouths, grimace, scratch their head, loose their tie, etc. The mechanics for the action scenes are similar to that of GTA IV. You have the same cover system, you can brawl occasionally and you have car chases where your partner does the shooting. You just need to make sure you are as close to the suspect's vehicle as possible so that your detective partner can shoot the tires. Sometimes, your job is to apprehend a suspect in a non-lethal way - if not by brawling then by running after and tackling him. These scenes can get very repetitive which I did not mind in particular - except some of them felt a little too scripted: I thought I could get a guy if I was quick only to realise he was meant to be stopped by an accident. Another minor annoyance is the interview part: sometimes you are convinced the suspect is lying. You know you do not have any evidence so you pick the option ""Doubt"" but it turns out the guy was right so he was probably making a grimace due to being confused. As the game has an auto-save function you can easily quit and reload to try again but after a while this can be annoying. It just feels that Rockstar had a certain idea in mind for these choices and if you are lucky you can get the answer right.But what is there beside the cases you work on? Does LA Noire offer you the option of free roaming? I am happy to say it does: dispatch informs you of ongoing crimes and you can leave your current case to pursue these. Also, there are TONS of items to look for: badges, famous landmarks, film reels and 95 (!) vehicles to get into. Once you get into a car it is ""unlocked"". Under ""Extras"" in the main menu you'll find a showroom to have a look at an already unlocked vehicle. Many look pretty similar but they can be different models - sometimes it feels a bit ridiculous to get in and out of every vehicle you find in a parking lot but there's no other way for you to find all of them. I have to admit I could only collect 90% of them.As for the cases: you have everything you need. Narcotics, arsons, thefts, grand theft auto, cases with corrupt cops, serials killer, etc. The places you visit are varied and look realistic. Accompanying music and sound effects also represent an excellent quality.LA Noire has 21 cases. It feels as if you were watching a season of your favourite crime series. 21 episodes of it. And when it is over you are happy but at the same time you are eager to see what's coming in the next season. I wish LA Noire had one more season.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												L.A. Noire is not just a detective game, it's truly so much more in my opinion. This game is based around the late fourties when LA is at its Golden Age of the movie industry and the evy of the world. Your protaginist, Cole Phelps, is a WWII veteran now serving for the LAPD. Every section of the game, you get a new partener who specializes in that type of section of cases to be solved. The game's map is just massive, of authentic late fourties LA streets which bring great details according to the time period. Every case is based mainly how much of the clues you've found during the case, as well the damage of you've caused to the city, but mainly the interrogation questions you had to ask and confirming their 3 types. If you like these type of games, I highly recommend L.A. Noire to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I've played so far. Very original and fun, with some challenge to it. To start off, the graphics are dated, but not bad at all. The motion scanner they used on the characters really bring them to life and play a big role in interrogations.You play as a detective in the 1940's, and as such you examine crime scenes, find clues, and interogate suspects. It's all original and very interesting to do. Interrogation can oftentimes be tough, so I recommend taking your time finding all possible clues and examining the expressions of suspects very carefully. Trying to prove that a person is lying is particurlarly tricky, but very satisfying. The game has chase scenes, both on foot and in cars. There are gun fights, which are fun but not particularly noteworthy. The city of LA is open-world, and you can find hidden cars and do some sightseeing. It must be said, however, that the game is very mature, and you will often find brutal killings, blood, and naked victims. There are a lot of mature topics as well as some disturbing things, so I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone under 16. Overall, the game is very fun and definitely worth your time and money.

												This is a dark and controversial detective story taking place in L.A. of 1947. Everyone's a sinner in this game. It's very good at visually, musically and sometimes psychologically resembling the real Los Angeles of that time. The city consists of a couple of connected districts, from Hollywood to the central one. That is enough to make the game world huge. There are 95 types of cars from the most famous manufacturers, like Ford, GMC, Buick and Chevrolet. As for the gameplay, it feels like Mafia II combined with a groundbreaking police detective simulator inspired by well known crimes, such as The Black Dahlia murder. Among the innovations are the amazing facial animations never seen in videogames before. Unlike Mafia II, the game is mainly focused on looking for evidence, interviewing and interrogating people rather than gunfights. At the same time, nobody stops you from entering the Free Roam mode just to drive the cars, look around and prevent street crimes filled with action.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game of this type it was relatively short.  But it didn't feel short, it felt like it dragged on and on for some reason. Can't say it was really boring, but it was repetative.  Why they couldn't have mixed the cases up a little more instead of doing the same same 5 or 6 murder investigations in a row.  Did a good job capturing the Time and Location it's set in.  Good Soundtrack. Likable characters, both good and bad for the most part.  Even the secondary characters you interview were good. Open world, but instead of playing like an open world it cut to a new ""level"" for each investigation. Entire game would have been better if the protagonist had either been a Private Eye, or if the game had fewer gun fights and car chases and more actual puzzles and investigations.  Interviews are sometimes unneccisarily difficult. Story jumps around alot.  Dramatic scenes that made no sense because there was no set up.  A single scene or few lines of dialog giving better context to the next part of the story arc would have made alot of the game more enjoyable.  in 30 hours of gameplay you wont necessarily remember someones signifigance  from a random unconnected scene from 25 hours ago.  Ending was garbage.  Overall like 6.5 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish i could unlock the 30 fps lock and have a better saving system...Otherwise LA Noire targets niche-players. If you'd rather play a slow paced game that requires (a bit) brains and concentration instead of running with a gun and shooting everything that crosses your path, then you may enjoy LAN . Otherwise, well the game's very slow, and quite clumsy at that.One of the main selling point was the ""incredible facial features""... well, i won't lie it's sometimes pretty bad, most of the time okeyish, seldomly accurate. Thus sometimes leading you to failing questionning a suspect because you misinterpreted something that obviously means he is stressed (eyes going all around, mouth grinning) but actually doesnt :^)While at it, i really enjoyed the gameplay phases on the crime scenes. Searching for evidences, trying to find connections during the multiple elements you've found, all that is really well done.The story's interesting, not great, but interesting and not too predictable. It's a bit disjointed though.The background musics are perfectly on point and the voice acting, both in french and english, is great. These are some of the game main strengths.Now one of the most important part to my mind, the graphics: in 2017, it looks bad. The 30 fps lock and low resolution textures are really awful (i looked for a solution but couldnt find one, it's certainly on me tho, there must be some program that allows you to play at 60 fps). That's a shame to  be honest, since the atmosphere is so well rendered. It really feels like beeing in an good ol' 60's city. Kinda like Mafia 2, which actually looked better.The atmosphere is pin-point what you could expect from a game taking place in the 50-60's.In the end, if you really dont mind the 30 fps lock, if you dont mind a few frustrations ""God how the hell is that guy not lying with a face like that?"", if you enjoy slow paced games then it's made for you.Otherwise, well i still think it's a nice experience to live. I've not finished it yet but will in a close future.I dont recommend it if you cant suffer playing at 30 fps. It really is a downside, and Rockstar's well known for their poor pc port anyway...

If you can deal with a 30 FPS cap and absolutely no support for anything higher than 60 FPS, this version of the game is okay.I wouldn't dump twenty dollars into this, or the thirty dollars the complete edition is asking for.

												Some FACTS about LA Noire:- The game is 4 years old and the facial animations are STILL un-freaking-believable.- The music is phenomenal.  How many video games have a jazz soundtrack?- You can play the game in ""black and white"" (and it looks gorgeous this way).- The writing is better neo-noire than most films have ever managed.- The city of 1947 LA was directly modeled from aerial photographs.- THE CARS OMG THE CARS!!!!!- When you interview people, their facial movements reveal if they're lying.- This is based on real science, so playing this game will improve your lie detector skills irl.LA Noire is a masterpiece.  It isn't as wildly popular as it deserves to be because it focuses more on style and detail than on NONSTOPACTIONPEWPEWPEW.  But if you're all grown up, wearing your big girl panties, this game will impress the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK, first things first, the 30 fps lock is unforgaivable in any game today.In it's favour - crime scenes are usually interesting, clue gathering never feels a chore and interaction with other characters is entertaining.  I'm not sure the 'expression system' quite works or perhaps I am just very bad at reading faces.The negatives - The graphics are a bit choppy and controls are unresponsive.  Both of these you can live with even though they are annoying.The biggest minus is having to play 'Cole' - every time the guy opens his mouth you want to smack him!  I think I get where they wanted to go with him, good guy scarred by war etc, but what they created is a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who needs either a year or two in a mental institute to get over himself or a job with no contact at all with the rest of the human race.It's really difficulyt to play a game hating your character and hoping he gets beaten to a pulp each mission.  Sometimes I don't fight back because he so obviously needs a lesson.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved everything about this game. The quality of the graphics, story and imersive environment design really reflect the research they did on Film Noire, and post WWII era. This game really shines in all aspects. It's just a damn shame the game didn't utilize the expansive open world that was created. That in of itself was a huge loss of potential, and my only complaint.Wish Rockstar games would plan a sequal. I'd love to revisit this qulity game play, in say 70's-80's Miami or something of that sort.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having the same problem as everyone else.I bought the game during the Summer Sale and had high hopes of playing it. I recently upgraded my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Tried running the game but it wont load. I click the launch button, a small window pops up saying the game is loading, the window goes away and nothing happens.I have tried many of the ""fixes"" that involve running the game AND steam in Admin mode, installing RockStar Social Club, I tried following the guide posted on Rockstar https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200149556--NET-C-DirectX-Nothing-happening-after-pressing-Launch-in-L-A-Noire-  but nothing works. I think I am going to install Windows 7 on an extra HD and see if I can get it to run. Anyone on Windows 7 have the same problem or is it only a happening on Windows 8 and 10?Im only voting it down because it cant run it ATM. However I am going to keep the game anyways since it was only $5. Maybe i'll get it to work on Winodws 7 or maybe a real fix will come out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the age of the game, the graphics are very well done. The facials (insert joke here) are movie like thanks to some special technology they implemented in this game. Being a ROCKSTAR game, many people purchased it thinking it would be a shortened GTA-like game. This is not what it is, although it does feel like it at times.Despite being classified as open world, there was a linear feel to the game. I truly don't understand the obsession many gamers have with ""open world"" (perhaps instead of a story, they want an escape from their miserable exsistences), but this linear story suited me just fine.  The game was more like a visual novel or interactive movie, which i enjoyed, but was also the #1 complaint many had about this game during discussions with friends. They craved more action. They wanted a GTA like experience.I found the game relaxing, THEN INTENSE, then slow, and i can see how many with attention deficit disorder (if you grew up in the 90's) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (the new excuse for the kids today) can't muster enough attention to read more than 148 characters at a time.The guides available thru steam are well written, fully detailed, and make difficult parts smoother when you had enough of scratching your head. They would let you get some drawn out achievements with ease provided you invest the time and attention span. Right now it's 70% off ($5.09 CND), and for that price it's a steal of a deal. Over all, i'd give this game a 8/10 and at its currently price, I'd stamp it with BigRig's cheap♥♥♥♥♥game buyer Stamp.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game is simply amazing.First of all, i already got the game for two month. My friend bought me this game. Since he told me its by Rockstar Games i really wanted to try it. Some days ago i installed it and i realized its looks like Mafia 2. I mean the mood, the cars, the time. So i really like it, i just did 2 crime yet, but i really enjoyed them. Sometimes it can be very hard, at least in the begining it can be solved if you thinking, but later it will be much harder :D So, what i would like to say. If you like Mafia 2 or GTA this game made for you. May you need to solve chrimes and sometimes its seems boring, but its not. Really awesome game! Love you Rockstar!MUST PLAY!:)			",130,30,6,14,12,0,10

												A WW2 game that doesn't involve WW2, you play the role of Cole Phelps. A cop who, by sheer luck, stumbles upon a gruesome murder, the first two of which have racism as the motive. Eventually becoming a detective, it becomes increasingly clear that the system is completely corrupt and it's up to your scientologist friend and fake german wife to save the world from psychology while you sort vice squad cases off on the side with a shotgun and cigar. Every cop you encounter is intentionally incompitent, and you eventually get to shoot them all when your space marine firebat friend takes to the caves to fight Charlie. Origami plays a major role in the game, making it the only game to involve folding paper into little swans important.Because it's California, drugs,♥♥♥♥♥♥on the railroad and arson by proxy cases usually lead to pedophillia and rifle stockpiles.Overall, a solid and unforgettable game, mostly because the villian doesn't do anything evil and never kills anyone.

Great game. Highly reccomend this. Only thing that could have possibly made this better is better graphics. But that it is hard to acheive 2k14 graphics when this was made in 2011. Fantastic work.

												7/10The game is an adventure game with Rockstar trappings.You investigate crimes, follow leads, question witnesses, interrogate suspects, and occasionally subdue criminals with force.  The game has a wondeful ambiance, a great score, and very strong characters.Why not a better score than 7/10?  Three things cost it those three points for me:1) The ""GTA""-like elements feel out of place/unnecessary.  The game is 80% criminal investigation, 20% action (car-chases/shoot-outs/fist-fights).  The action bits feel ""tacked-on"" and are not fleshed out very well in comparison to the rest of the game.  Driving between locations feels largely pointless with very little to do between points-of-interest.2) The interrogation/questioning aspect can come off as a little strange at times. You might know that a suspect is lying, but it isn't always clear if you've got the correct piece of evidence to directly accuse them of lying. When you make a bad choice, you look like an idiot, but it doesn't change the outcome of the case for the most part. The story moves forward even if you bungle all the questioning/interrogating/evidence gathering parts.3) The ending sucks. It's abrupt and leaves a lot of loose ends. It feels like they ran out of time. I know that's my opinion, but I'm sure many other people feel the same.			",103,15,0,17,2,1,3

												My 48 hours of play time was all on Windows 7 from earlier this year. I have since built myself a new computer with Windows 8.1 x64 and, as many reviews here state, the game doesn't launch. I tried running it in Windows 7 compatiblity mode - nothing. From the looks of it this problem has been around for years now and still no formal fix. That's pretty disgusting. This is such a great classic game. I feel terrible for people who never got a chance to play it and now never will if they're on a ""newer"" operating system. If you're on Windows 7 or earlier, I highly recommend the game. If you're in the majority of Windows users who have moved on to Windows 8/8.1 or Windows 10, don't bother. Rockstar has this same problem with GTA IV and they do nothing about it. Blows my mind. Don't they want people to continue buying their games even years later? Clearly it's too much trouble for a billion dollar company to support newer operating systems for older games. Good one you f*ck faces.Update: There is a patch that was installed where the game finally opens without crashing but, guess what, the performance is so bad it's truly unplayable unless you enjoy 12fps. I've tried every fix possible from the ""-npd"" command line, running it in DirectX9, choosing single thread, changing the resolution in game, creating a custom resolution, etc The menu seems to be capped at 24fps and in game it hovers around 28fps about twenty percent of the time - eighty percent of the time it's fluctuating between 12 - 25fps. I'm so sick of it. The best I can do is get the menu to go back to it's default 30fps cap but, once I'm in game, ithe performance is the same 18fps average. So unfair. Steam needs to put a disclaimer on the store page of this game that cleary states - If you have Windows 8/8.1 there are common issues still unresolved and to buy at your own risk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is some really solid foundation here with the setting, stories, a city that actually feels alive and fleshed out.  Unfortunately it's plagued with sound issues, UI issues, mechanic issues, control issues, and gameplay issues that all add up to a really frustrating game that just feels like a letdown.  I was too irritated with all the problems and faults along the way to feel satisfied at the end of any given case.  Important text during important dialogue so you only get half of what you need is just poor design.  But the number one irritation is driving.  Driving across the whole blasted city over and over again with poor control of the car and a city full of fools that can't drive and a lack of streetlights in half the intersections.  And the driving has NO impact on the game other than there can be some flavor audio while you're struggling across town and you get fined for the inevitable damage to the car.  If you can actually get past all these issue and annoyances, then yes, it's an inovative game that differs from anything else I've ever seen.			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

												... This game REPEATEDLY forces you to jump to illogical conclusions. As much as I want to like this game, FORCING the player to make poor judgement calls takes away from the experience. This flaw was a constant reminder that I was trapped within the rules of the game. As ambitious as it tried to be, LA Noire can't deliver on it's promises of ""true detective work"". Maybe if they spent as much time and money on gameplay as they did on facial animation (which, I admit, is pretty epic...), I could understand the hype.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I'm kind of missing a middle option in terms of ratings here.While it's not a espacially good game. It isn't a bad game either.In terms of technical aspects. The graphics are nothing mind blowing by any stretch of the imagination, but they aren't bad either. There's a strict 30fps lock going on, which I couldn't find a quick fix to by googling (such as changing a line in some config file) So I just decided to suck it up and enjoy the ""console experience"".The gameplay:The investigating comes down to looking long enough for ""clues"" and interrogating people afterwards and deciding wether they area) lying (and you have proof in form of one of the clues you previously collected)b) lying (and you don't have proof, but are in fact just suspecting they are lying) - this option is confusingly labeled ""doubt""c) telling the truthThe rest of the gameplay comes down to some shooter-segments, some car chases. Neither of which are particualarly good.The Main positive about the game in my opinion is the Story, which I actually found pretty interesting. However the actual plot only develops very slowly during the beginning and middle of the playtime. The story gets more interesting towards the end when the plot thickens.Another Selling Point is the setting of post WW2 America in the late 40s, which isn't beeing explored in very many games. So If you think this sounds like a interesting setting just because it isn't such common theme in video games, then this might be something for you.So overall I said I don't recommend this game because there is no middle option, cause that is what this game has written all over it in my opinion. And I reserve the ""I recommend this game"" option for games that I think are actually worth recommending, such as the Witcher 3, Tomb Raider(The Reboot), or Bioshock Infinite,...This doesn't mean I think LA:Noire is bad, it's just not as good as those games which I just mentioned in my opinion.And it honestly feels kind of like a♥♥♥♥♥♥move to click the thumb down-button, because I know that people that don't read the review will just think I thought it was a bad game, when really I don't.

												This game requires you to sign up for Rockstar's ""social club"" in order to play it.  Not in order to use multiplayer (If it has it, I don't know.), but in order to start the game at all.  I already have an account on Steam, the service through which I bought the game.  I shouldn't be required to sign up for extra things every time I buy a game from a new company.  Otherwise what's the point in having a game client like steam.  Buy this game on console if you want it so badly.  Then you won't have to deal with this crap.			",60,15,1,19,3,0,17

												A truly unique game, executed well. Instead of playing as a dangerous criminal, you play as the good guy who is trying to solve crimes.This game takes place in 1940s LA. Rockstar managed to recreate the world well and it provides a unique atmosphere to the game. There's not going to be too many instances where you go around killing people with your gun, because this is supposed to be an investigation game, rather than a open world city sandbox game. The plot can be unpredictable, and keeps the player interested to continue the game. Graphics are quite nice, and the DLCs are also worth trying.However, the PC version is by flawed, too. The game seems to be poorly optimized for PC, as it has a 30fps lock and many people have a hard time running this game.Get it, if you can find a way around the 30fps lock and can fix the game with some mods.9/10			",93,7,7,12,5,0,15

												Flawed gem that never really got the success it needed (and maybe even deserved).The gameplay itself swings between overly simplistic (finding clues) to somewhat obtuse and illogical (the way the interrogations are handled sounds great on paper, but simply don't hold together very well), and the driving and combat is perfunctory and servicable. Where the game really shines though is in the setting and story. You can really feel the love and attention that has gone into getting the feel of the time period right, and the details that really tie the story together.Is it cliche and perhaps a little predictable at times? Of course. But it's a love letter to a genre we don't see much of these days. It will make you want to dust of your LA Confidential DVD, and wear a sharp suit.			",245,101,3,35,32,1,65

												L.A Noire is not the awesome crime investigation game it promised to be, but it is a good game overall.The face animations are outstanding, despite some exagerations here and there.The dialogs are for the most part engaging and believable.The crime scenes are detailed and interesting.However, there are no major branching paths in the story. Very rarely you can fail a investigation, when suspect interrogations fail, your superior scolds you and suddenly you repeat the dialog sequence all over again.I had extremely high expectations for this game, it didn't deliver completely, but it is an immersive game nonetheless.

												There is no other game like this! Best detective simulation ever. Period.If you like interactive movie type games, crime solving, atmosphere of 1940's, clever writing, superb acting (not just voice acting, REAL actors job on every character here) then this is a MUST OWN title, just don't expect this to be a GTA set in an old american setting. 10/10 one of the most memorable games of the past 5 years yetP.S.:Too bad we will never see a sequel because Team Bondi went bankrupt.

												Amazing game. It is not your regular ""look for a distinctive pixel"" detective story, it actually takes an ability to read people by their reactions in order to get the useful info during interrogations and thanks for GTA-like gameplay style, it even has some action in it (like chasing down suspects, eavesdropping and stuff like this). Also, actors done a really good job. Rockstar hired some fine professionals.			",75,10,0,18,5,0,5

												Great story about post-WW2 Los Angeles, I love the setting. It is very interesting to play as a detective, looking for clues and reading people's facial expressions. The technology they used for realistic faces helps it a lot. On the other hand, shooting feels quite dull, I do not think there should have been that much of it. Also, driving is boring too, even though there's an open world, it just feels empty, and most of the time you will probably want to skip it.All in all, L.A. Noire is a very good game, definitely worth trying, especially if you like detective genre games.			",256,62,6,23,32,9,34

												This is a good game which will be overlooked as forgettable by once mountain-dew-addled-teens who are now adults as choose your own adventure GTA. This game has more in common with world exploration games and the old arcade classic Dragonslair than it ever did with the zany violent world of Grand Theft Auto. The developers have presented an entire world full of beautiful set pieces, interesting and engaging characters and violence that is presented as a story device rather than reward for getting through the narrative elements. Sure, the game plays pretty much the same on replay but with hundreds of variations depending on who you kill, where you go first and what questions you ask. The game has been cheap often for a long time now and if you haven't had the pleasure of digging into a game that will make you feel something different, you should get this.			",187,65,0,28,34,1,18

												Beautiful game world and fun, hard combat/driving missions; I've been meaning to play through for years. My HDD frying made me forget about it ages ago. Only thing I remember not liking is when I had like 3 naked females victims in a row and idk it just got annoying after the second. Its awesome fun solving murders, some of the stories are super memorable and nasty. I love being a badass LA cop and having old time-y shootouts with the roof parkour they have in a lot of missions. The game does a lot of things well, I loved taking cover behind old time-y tanky cars during a shooting with allies covering you. Your basically Rick Grimes in LA in the 50s solving murders and sending crazy people to Hades. Def worth the money and I didn't even make it throught the game yet.			",97,13,0,19,10,0,9

												L.A. Noire does what Americans do best: to complain about themselves.L.A. Noire features the city of Los Angeles as a prototype for the present cities: a city made for cars, not for people. The city of ""opportunities"" (opportunists), the film industry and corrupt politicians. All of this amid the flowering of psychiatry, drug trafficking, property speculation and the American dream.The protagonist is a decorated war hero who now works as a police officer. During the game, the protagonist is promoted to detective. Along the game you investigate several cases, and uncover a true conspiracy. The noir atmosphere is always present. The soundtrack and the voice-acting is very good.			",241,169,4,31,7,0,14

												The story is decent, but the narrative is superb and one of the best ever. The game is a mix out of 3rd-person action and detective gameplay. Thankfully, the detective part is a lot bigger. You interview people, decide if they tell the truth or lie and prove that they are not telling the truth. It's a unique experience and, as I said before, one of the best. 1940s LA really feels authentic.			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

												For all it's flaws, I loved L.A. Noire.The port, first off, is woeful. After you've contended with Rockstar Social Club updating and generally being a nuisance, the fight is getting the game looking pretty while keeping the framerate consistent. I played the whole thing through at the locked-in 30fps, and had a fine time.For it's time, this is a beautiful, innovative game. The facial models make characters readable and relatable, and the generally minimalist nature of the game - few HUD features popping in or out, heavy reliance on sound rather than visual signposting - allows the game to unfold like a dense TV series rather than a videogame. The atmosphere is exceptional, and period music and vehicles only add to that.The story is good, although it wanes towards the end. The same goes for the gameplay - it is fun, unique, and rewarding, but also blows its wad off the bat: by the endgame, you're doing the same things you were at the very start.Even still, a fantastic single-player experience.

Review of L.A Noire - Complete EditionPositive:+Great storyline, easy to follow and understand!+Graphics aren't too bad for game released 2011+Several missions, even more with the ''DLC''+The DLC whitch gives you several new outfits and unlocks many cases for you to solve out, is practically free for you because the main game costs witouth sales 29,99€ meanwhile the DLC whitch includes original game, is 29,99€ = Profit for you!+Achievements, and several puzzles for you to solve if you want to take break of the main-story+Huge map of Los Angeles, dating back to the mid and late 40's, they did well with getting the atmosphere there!Negative:-Team Bondi does not accurenly show any kinda of interest to this game, there have not been a single update to this game after I bought it, whitch was in Summer Sale 2014, a fairly long time ago!-Yes there is many cars, but I'd like if you could ride the trams and busses in the game too tho' this is not a big deal at all-The worst thing with this game is it's support for PC version is just... Bad, this was made for the consoler first, and then the team got lazy on importing it to PC version so they just took the exact copy of the X360 and PS3 versions and put it in the PC version = 30FPS lock, and it looks f*cking bad! It can be removed with a program but that does not completely fix it, instead makes it worse in some cases i.ex when driving a vehicle, the physics becomes very bad and you can not steer the vehicle almost at all, but I recommend you to turn it off while driving and just trying to survive that 30FPS maddnes, it's just a game afterall I guess...Altho' some of it's negative feedback I gave this game, I can easilly give this game a 8.5/10 rating!

												L.A. Noire is an engrossing tale derived the famous City of Angels that has you playing the role of an L.A.P.D. detective.  It features a vast open-world environment set in 1947 just after the Second World War. The characters, level of detail and the mature setting draws you into the era and presents the player with a unique blend of third-person action and point-and-click adventure. You will be thrown into car chases, foot pursuits, shootouts, interviews and setup to investigate crime scenes where you must establish motive and means. L.A.  Noire is simply a must for gamers!

COMPLETED 100%Game has a great flair of originality in it with gameplay elements you don't see in any other game out there. The open world is rendered beautifully in 1940s L.A. with incredibly detailed landmarks and plenty of interiors you can just walk straight into and explore even with no incentive given to do so.  What it does good though, it fails a largely in repetitiveness and a rather disconnected story that mostly just consists of a bunch of cases that always ends up with you arresting the culprit, guilty or not, it doesnt even matter. The same game elements like investigations and interrogations that looked interesting at first eventually starts getting stale and might become quite a chore to do, with so little in the way of variation.Trying to ace interviews and interrogation scenes are not the least easy and sometimes the correct answers (Lie, Doubt, Truth) doesn't make sense. I started this game mostly looking forward to a good detective noir story but what turned out instead is quite a disappointment. The central plot only gets underway in the final desk of the game making everything you did before nothing more than random crime cases. Story overall is nothing impressive and even seemed quite rushed. Mediocre at best.Look past the flaws however, and the game still holds up with brilliant dialogue and voice acting and exceling in innovation in its own rights.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A Noire is not the awesome crime investigation game it promised to be, but it is a good game overall.The face animations are outstanding, despite some exagerations here and there.The dialogs are for the most part engaging and believable.The crime scenes are detailed and interesting.However, there are no major branching paths in the story. Very rarely you can fail a investigation, when suspect interrogations fail, your superior scolds you and suddenly you repeat the dialog sequence all over again.I had extremely high expectations for this game, it didn't deliver completely, but it is an immersive game nonetheless.

												Wow, what a game... first, let me say that I've always been interested in WWII and the post-war world in the United States.  This game combines all my interests into one package.  It is fascinating to just drive around and look at things (clothes, cars, shops, etc...) and see how they were in 1947.  The gameplay is also well done too, you basically wander around in L.A. and try to solve crimes by looking for clues and talking to people.  The lip-synching is fantastic, L.A. Noire could almost pass for an animated movie.  When questioning witnesses, you have to really look at their faces to see if they are lying or telling partial truths, it takes some practice but you'll get good at it with just a little time.  Think of this game as a time machine back to the late 1940's, it lets you experience the time period in a way that you could never do by just reading books or watching movies.  I was a little worried about the performance issues I'd read about but the game runs absolutely fine on my old dual core PC (with a few small additions in the launch options).  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about it... get it now and start playing, you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game with a pleasant atmospheric experience based in 1940s Los Angeles as Detective Cole Phelps. The graphcs are good in terms of setting a balance of immersion by creating a very realistic vibe. The street crime cases add a bit of flavor to the overall gameplay to a game that may seem too linear to some by providing a bit of uncertainty for when the next case will come. The main cases are very interesting and carry a lot of suspense and intrigue. The downside of many of these cases is that they may become too easy for some and may not prove to be a good challenge. However, it is important to note that only the chase scenes can be a bit too easy, but actually finding the clues and persons of interests in the right order can prove to be a challenge. The controls are the typical WASD and a realistic point and shoot dynamic without any visible crosshairs. Overall, I found it a very pleasing game to play and there is a certain uniqueness that creates an enticing desire to continue to the next case.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm currently in the middle of the game, as a homicide detective. As I don't want to provide spoilers, I'll try to be brief. At first I thought that the crime or chapters of the homicide cases were poorly written because although some of the clues pointed out to the ""person of interest"" being the criminal, even though not everything fit into place. After playing through the chapters a few more times, I thought maybe it was just the developer's way of portraying the LAPD in the 1940's and their focus on convicting a suspect instead of actually finding out who did it and delivering justice; justice however is relative to the person dishing it out and the person receiving it. It could also be that all the cases lead up to a true mastermind framing everybody else, so that is something to look forward to. Overall, the gameplay is pretty enjoyable in the sense that it is quite similar to GTA. So if you're a GTA or mystery fan, and you are also interested in playing the role of the cop instead of the role of a robber, I would highly recommend this.			",10,2,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful game world and fun, hard combat/driving missions; I've been meaning to play through for years. My HDD frying made me forget about it ages ago. Only thing I remember not liking is when I had like 3 naked females victims in a row and idk it just got annoying after the second. Its awesome fun solving murders, some of the stories are super memorable and nasty. I love being a badass LA cop and having old time-y shootouts with the roof parkour they have in a lot of missions. The game does a lot of things well, I loved taking cover behind old time-y tanky cars during a shooting with allies covering you. Your basically Rick Grimes in LA in the 50s solving murders and sending crazy people to Hades. Def worth the money and I didn't even make it throught the game yet.			",97,13,0,19,10,0,9

Well, Installation worked but that is all. The Game doesn't start. There is no error message, nothing. Searched the web for solutions, tried them all... wasted a lot time. I don't give up that fast, but after hours I am fed up.So Game is a lot of fun if you're able to launch it.Think I switch to the PS Version of my husband even though I like the PC Version better.Thanks for nothing :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire does what Americans do best: to complain about themselves.L.A. Noire features the city of Los Angeles as a prototype for the present cities: a city made for cars, not for people. The city of ""opportunities"" (opportunists), the film industry and corrupt politicians. All of this amid the flowering of psychiatry, drug trafficking, property speculation and the American dream.The protagonist is a decorated war hero who now works as a police officer. During the game, the protagonist is promoted to detective. Along the game you investigate several cases, and uncover a true conspiracy. The noir atmosphere is always present. The soundtrack and the voice-acting is very good.			",241,169,4,31,7,0,14

												L.A Noire is not the awesome crime investigation game it promised to be, but it is a good game overall.The face animations are outstanding, despite some exagerations here and there.The dialogs are for the most part engaging and believable.The crime scenes are detailed and interesting.However, there are no major branching paths in the story. Very rarely you can fail a investigation, when suspect interrogations fail, your superior scolds you and suddenly you repeat the dialog sequence all over again.I had extremely high expectations for this game, it didn't deliver completely, but it is an immersive game nonetheless.

												Well, I`d like to compare it with older or old games where you need solve crimes. First, here you are in 3rd person, map is open to you, go where you want - that is a big plus for me. Second you have these face animations, which IMHO really fresh up the crime solving game genre (Yeah, sometimes they are repeating, sometimes NPC are bluffing - check your evidence thoroughly again, do not fear call them lying, sometimes it helps what to choose right answer). AND every person you talk to IS real actor, not just the same person`s face is edited and used for say, five, six NPC`s, but one actor - one NPC. Hell this game has amount of actors like and average movie :) Many cars. Well, not that many, as actors, but many. Duplicates seen, but mostly in parking lots. No big deal. And story. Story is great. Sound is great. Driving/ steering with keyboard, I think a bit too sensitive, but you can adapt after some time. Hm, what else... Annoying dispatcher voice... looks there is only one dispatcher in whole LA (sometimes other voice is heard, but too briefly) I haven`t played newest Sherlock Holmes game, so can`t compare with it and at this moment I can tell it is the best crime solving game I have ever played.

El juego trata sobre resolver casos, eso es basicamente el juego, asi como resolver misiones secundarias donde atrapas a los villanos en acción, es un juego muy repetitvo, por eso digo que si esto no es lo tuyo, seguramente L.A.

This game is all about being a Detective. So you cant go shoot every one. You have to be patient and think methodical and listen what everyone is saying when you talk to NPC's, so you can choose what to do for your own storyline.

												All in all a very atmospheric game, which allows one to submerge himself into post-war LA.Minuses are: - very weak in certain plot areas, which leave one wandering about the imbecility of the police portrayed, as well as the impossible prowess of the culprit in planting evidence at just the right moment (Homicide squad cases);- there is no way to disarm an armed opponent, even if you shoot his weapon hand (which is perfectly possible due to the good aiming system), you can only shoot to kill. not a very police-like attitude.- most cases follow a similar structure, which is theoretically hidden by their actual storyline, but can still feel like repeating routine procedures. Could count as a bonus on portraying police-work correctly though.Despite this, in my opinion, a very worthwhile game, solid 8/10 from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 2, 2014
												Story - I should start off this review by saying I am totally biased in favor of this game and it is my favorite game in my library at the time of writing.  I love the setting of the 1940's and especially the noir and detective aspects.  This game is the closest you will get to playing L.A. Confidential: The Video Game.  I found the story and even the individual cases to be very engrossing and they feel like actual crimes that could have been committed.  I love a video game with a great story above all else and this one totally delivers on that.  All of the characters feel very real and have more depth than in other Rockstar games.  Cole Phelps, the protagonist, at first seems like a squeaky clean detective, but as the story goes on, that changes and you become very engrossed in him as a character.  When you add a deep and perplexing murder myster to that, I was hooked.  There are even real historical characters (gangsters like Bugsy Siegel) in the game and scientology makes an appearance (in an interesting way) too.Gameplay - You assume the role of Detective Cole Phelps and investigate crimes, interrogate suspects, tail suspects, and sometimes get in shoot outs and fist fights.  I really like the way L.A. Noire handles investigations.  You have to find clues at the crime scenes by picking up and examining objects.  When you find suspects, you can interview them and respond in three ways (truth, doubt, or lying) depending on what they say.  This is probably the most challenging part of the game because unless you're very good, it can be hard to know whether to doubt or call the suspect a liar.  You can and will arrest the wrong person if you get too many questions wrong or don't find all the evidence.  Fortunately, there are plenty of guides out there to help you if you are worried about getting it wrong.  In total, the game has somewhere between 20-30 cases and it took me around 30 hours to get through them all.  I never got tired of playing L.A. Noire and would have played many more cases if I could.A lot of the other game play is really similar to Grand Theft Auto.  Driving is arcadey in a good way and shooting is cover based and pretty fun too.  While you spend more time investigating in missions than doing shooting and car chases, the game also offers street crimes which are often foot or car chases with a shoot out or a fist fight thrown in.  These aren't necessary to beat the game but they are fun and were a nice addition.  Presentation (Graphics and Sound) - The graphics in L.A. Noire are both dated and incredibly impressive at the same time.  I'm pretty sure this game uses a version of the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine and while the graphics are solid, they do look like a PS3 game and if you have a good gaming pc, you can certainly find games that look better.  What makes this game great though is the acting and animation of the characters.  L.A. Noire uses a newer animation system that captured the way the voice actors looked and acted when delivering the lines.  This makes it possible to see when someone is lying and it also makes the characters look really distinct and believable.  I hope we'll see more games use this technology in the future.  In addition, the makers of this game put an incredible amount of detail into replicating the Los Angeles of the 1940's.  The city looks and feels real.  There is so much detail and nothing feels recycled when you drive around. The sound is excellent from the voice acting to the authentic music on your car radio when you drive around.  I love the theme song for this game and think it sets the mood for the game better than almost any other I've seen.  Overall - As I said at the beginning, I truly love this game.  From the story to the realism to the satisfying game play, I think L.A. Noire has it all.  If you don't care about these things, especially a great story then it is very possible you will like this game a lot less than I do or lose interest in it before beating it.  I've certainly heard people say that they felt this way and I think this is just one of those games that some people will really love and others will just find to be pretty good.  However, if my review sounds appealing to you, this game is one of Rockstar's best and that is really saying something.As far as achievements go, this game is very easy to get a high percentage on by playing through the game once and trying to grab achievements as you go.  You will want to find a good guide for getting five stars on every case and for making sure to use all the weapons in the game or you will have to repeat parts of the game.  The one that kept me from trying to get them all is an achievement that makes you drive every car in the game.  There isn't an easy to find all of these cars and you almost need some luck to get them all.  That one is a bit of a bummer but I would still say that compared to other games, L.A. Noire has more reasonable achievements, especially if you can live with getting 90% or so of them.9.5 (out of 10)			",28,29,0,3,4,0,10

												A little bit of action, a little bit of driving, a little bit of shooting but like 80-90% of the game is similar to watching a well-directed detective drama. Or rather being a part of it. As the game becomes a bit repetitive and linear, you're getting a pivot. And then it's like the game plays you...up to the very end. Love this feeling.You know, I've installed Windows on my Mac just to play it. Well worth!			",36,43,4,5,9,0,13

Annoying dispatcher voice... looks there is only one dispatcher in whole LA (sometimes other voice is heard, but too briefly) I haven`t played newest Sherlock Holmes game, so can`t compare with it and at this moment I can tell it is the best crime solving game I have ever played.

												This is by far the best game I've ever played. I've only had this game for about a week and finished story mode. The story of this game is one of the most intresting stories I've seen. I highly rate this game because of all the action, all the puzzles you have to solve. Everything about this game is perfect. I know some people have the error that it crashes on start up and doesnt give you and error at all, I've actually had that exact error but for some reason after spamming the L.A. Noire icon it eventually opened. I was so happy when it did. I actually was about to give up on this game because I googled it after googling it about the error but I found nothing. Now that it works I'm very happy and this game is probably the best game I've ever played in my entire life so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Top Tip: to fast travel to any location select it on your map and then hold e until your character gets into a car and then it fades to black.  This is very important as LA Noire is approx 8 square miles and it does take some time to drive from one side to the other.  The game is fun, but it has a few issues.  As a console port the game is fixed at 30fps.  This is due in part to the special technology used to graphically capture actors’ face expressions.  The biggest problem that I have with the system is it sometimes sticks me at 25 FPS despite having a GTX 980 and plenty of headroom.  Overall, the graphics look pretty good and are satisfactory as long as it keeps running at 30fps. The gameplay is good too.  The cars drive well; the gunplay is fun, I wish there was more of it.  The detective questioning can be aggravating.  If you challenge a witness’ statement as a lie you must present some evidence to prove it, sometimes there are multiple pieces of evidence that indicate they are lying but choosing the wrong one results in a failed question. When interrogating two suspects you may be forced to charge someone who you don’t think is guilty just because you failed one interrogation.  The last issue is that if you suspect someone of being the criminal you cannot actually go after them unless it is scripted in the story.  I have mixed feelings about the plot, they make Phelps do some very uncharacteristic things to progress the story and bring everything together.  However, the scams that the local government and business owners put together is interesting and clever.  Overall, I am not much of a fan of detective stories, shows, etc; but this game is fun and if they come out with a second one I will pick it up.     ",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

												Spent 45 hours playing this and in the end, can't really recommend it. I think the concept is pretty cool and I really wanted to like it, but it has several major flaws:1) Boring - this game is just boring. It's like a very long movie in slow motion. You can't fast forward the cut scenes so everything is very slow paced. The game does not evolve from the first mission, you don't get more skills so it is all the same over and over. Talk to some people, chase down a suspect (which you are scripted to never catch), shoot some bad dudes, repeat.2) Bad conversation system - in conversations you can choose Truth/Doubt/Lie, the problem is that it is a crap shoot which one to pick. You are supposed to hear the voice and look at the animated face to determine if they are lying. That is all fine, but even if they are lying, you need to choose between Doubt/Lie, and if they are telling the truth it is still Doubt/Truth, it's whatever random choice the programmers decided is the correct answer. To elaborate, someone can be telling the truth, but if you don't think they are telling enough of a truth (not enough details) you are supposed to pick Doubt. That leads to save scumming/using a walkthrough since the system is so ridiculous. 3) Laughable story - most of the non-DLC missions are connected by a main story. It is too bad you can see the big story from a mile away. Even worse is that even though you can tell what is going on, you repeatedly arrest innocent people because you have to. In about half of the cases - I repeat, in HALF OF THE CASES - you have no option to actually arrest the true criminal. Best case is that you choose between two innocent people. You are hailed as the best detective in the LAPD - yeah ok.It isn't all bad, the game is beautiful and the voice acting is great. Issue is that the key systems don't work and the game is boring. If they had ditched the main story, actually let you catch true criminals and made it into a 10  hour game, then maybe it would have been better. One of the very few times where less would have been better.4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By the time I am writing this review, I have not yet finished the game, but I am 10 hours in and would like to share my opinion and impressions, which hopefully will help you to decide whether you should get this game. First of all, I'll start with the positive things: - The vibe and atmosphere/Setting: They did an AWESOME job at setting up the right setting and getting into the spirit of LA in 1947, at least IMO. I do like this period a lot, and the look of the game (if you like, you can play this in b/w as well), the music/radio broadcasts (unfortunately, no way to switch radio stations manually, apparently. No custom music either, but then again, listening to modern music in the car would kinda ruin the immersion), the cars, fashion, lingo etc... just GREAT. Also, since this is based on old thrillers and stories by guys like Raymond Chandler, they went for that vibe, and did it VERY well... this does feel a lot like a that noire crime fiction Chandler was famous for. - The general idea is very cool and, IMO, refreshing - interrogating people and, based on the clues you found and their facial expressions (done with actors and motion capture) figuring out whether they're lying or not... great job there! The IGN review says that sometimes, it is too easy to tell when someone is telling a lie or getting nervous - but doesn't that add even more realism? After all, not everyone is a good liar irl!- The gameplay. The cars DO feel a bit... odd, chases can get a tiny bit frustrating, the shooting mechanics are far from perfect, but between examining crime scenes, searching for clues, interrogating witnesses and suspects, using your notebook to find clues, car chases, shootouts and some interludes to deepen the story, there is some variety.- The characters. I really like the main protagonist, and some of his fellow policemen. Sure, there is quite a bit of clichè to be found here, but that again fits well, as this is a tribute to the noire-genre, which never was deep literature anyway. Now for the less than positive or even negative parts:- On rails. To a certain degree, the game takes away your freedom. An example: In one case, I apparently missed a clue at one of the places I visited. I was doing interrogations at the police station, and was not able to go back to those places and pick up the thing I missed, which would have made solving the case easier and unlocked some additional questions/accusations. - Evidence. Basically, if you think a person is not telling the truth, you wanna choose ""doubt"". If you pick ""lie"", you have to prove the person is a liar with a piece of evidence/clue from your notebook. And sometimes that doesn't work right. Not a bug, it's the writing. The abbreviated details of the clue or piece of evidence might make you think that it is clear evidence the guy is a liar, but when you choose it, the game says it's wrong or not enough. - Some frame rate issues. This game is by no means recent. I don't have a killer gaming pc (i7, 16 gigs of ram, Nvidia GTX 960 with 4 GB of ram), but I would think that it should be able to run this game well... and still, there are frame rate issues, the game sometimes slows down. Odd, when games like Unity, Mad Max, GTA V, Witcher III or even Arkham Knight perform much better on my system. YMMV. - Repetition. Sometimes, the cases are TOO alike, or at least the procedure you do is. There is a bigger storyline with a certain series of murders, and at one point, it was like ""OK, another murder like those other ones. Check for clues. Interrogate. Visit a bar. Visit another place. Interrogate. Done"". Of course, those steps should be part of it in a crime/police-game, but I think there should have been more variety in the cases or the activities that are involved in them. I did enjoy the homicide cases (after the first or second promotion), but didn't enjoy the drug-related cases I was given after my next promotion- Mechanics. As I said, driving feels...wonky. Mind you, you are not driving a very recent sports car or something like that, but the controls feel a bit clunky sometimes, and so do the physics. I did play the game with an Xbox controller. Verdict: The idea was refreshing, and they really nailed it with the setting and vibe. Unfortunately, there are flaws to the whole Lie/truth/doubt/clues/notebook-system. Sometimes it's misleading, not elaborate enough, and sometimes it's too much ""on rails"". However, the story, vibe and the idea itself are great, and even though it's not perfect, I'd give this a 7.5/10. I got this while it was on sale and do not regret it at all, I do enjoy the game. Check out some gameplay videos maybe, and if you can get it on sale and dig crime/police-games and the era this is set in, check it out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Игра, которая на первый взгляд казалась очередным клоном GTA, Mafia и прочих, оказалась очень и очень приятным сюрпризом. Плюсы:1) Геймплей. Сцены расследования и вдумчивого поиска улик вовремя сменяются погонями и перестрелками, и наоборот. Ни от того, ни от другого заскучать не успеваешь.2) Графика. Дело даже не самой графике, которую я на 100% не оценил из-за не слишком сильного железа, а в лицевой анимации. Персонажи проговаривают каждое слово, эмоции переданы очень и очень достоверно. Впервые вижу такой высокий уровень исполнения.3) Миссии. Они всегда увлекательные и интересные, со своей предысторией. За кровавым убийством обязательно скрывается драма, бармен не хочет выкладывать на-гора всю информацию, похищение оказывается следствием кризиса между супругами, а плохой парень в итоге оказывается хорошим. Даже побочные квесты, которые можно принимать при движении по городу, не повторяются, и их действительно интересно проходить. В этом отношении Rockstar, как всегда, не подкачали.4) Музыка. И та, что играет на радио, и та, что звучит во время расследований - уместно, атмосферно, выполнено на высоком уровне.Минусы:1) Первый и главный минус - Rockstar Games Social Club. Отвратительное дeрьмо, которое постоянно забывает мой пароль, лагает, просит зайти снова, в общем, всячески мешает играть. Если бы можно было приступить к игре, не заморачиваясь с регистрацией, стало бы только лучше.2) Еще один минус, менее существенный, но все же заметный - открытый мир. Песочница тут довольно-таки безжизненная, но основная проблема не в этом, а в том, что открытый мир тут не играет никакой роли, мы бы запросто могли обойтись и без него, автоматически перемещаясь по локациям, связанным с текущим расследованием. Местный сендбокс не делает ничего, помимо растягивания геймплея ненужными поездками из точки А в точку Б. Вспоминается старая добрая Mafia, в которой перед каждой миссией нужно катить через весь чертов город на убитом драндулете.3) Излишняя казуальность. Потратив так называемые очки интуиции, вы можете узнать правильную реплику при допросе или увидеть расположение всех (!) улик на месте преступления. Это ломает геймплей, связанный с расследованием.Итог: очень интересный эксперимент от Rockstar, не лишенный недостатков, но определенно стоящий того, чтобы ознакомиться с ним. 7/10 только лишь за отвратный RGSC.

												x_xSo in this game you pay as a legal criminal who works to take out the competition who don't have the same backing of the government. Okay... in all seriousness the player character is (mostly) a decent guy, but your fellow policemen tend to be either bitter, corrupt, or narrow-minded. And while the last of those makes sense for the 1940's, it still ensured that my opinion of police in this game is more or less what it is IRL: a handful of good people in a sea of jerks who are no better than the people they throw in jail.Anyway... gamey. You search crime scenes for things, interrogate people about the things you find, and sometimes shoot people since these are American police and they like to do that sort of thing. Though at least in this case all the people you are forced to shoot tend to be firing back at you, so I guess that's justifiable. While the gameplay isn't broken, it just... didn't work for me. I was bored alot of the time and the game choosing to rate my performance promoted save scumming and looking for guides rather than working things out for myself. And while I suppose it is my fault for deciding to skip the ""fun"" of figuring out things for myself, I just felt uninterested and wanted to be done with it all......well, until the late parts of the game, when things heat up and interesting plot stuff actually starts happening. And while the final level is a bit absurd by being a massive gunfight and a rushed ending with alot of unresolved messes, at least the stuff before it was interesting and kept me wanting to see where things would end up.I'm not sure about this game. It felt really long and the first half was profoundly lacking in excitement. I suppose that would be realistic: most police stuff is samey and boring I expect. But the ""realism"" here came at the cost of fun, and I could barely play more than a case at a time before I had to go do something else to entertain myself.But it's not a bad game. It's just not for me. I'll give this a ""yes"" because it works, does get better later on, and that there is no ""maybe"" option on Steam and I don't dislike this game enough to give it a ""no"".Yey... now I can do something else. x_x			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												Really fun detective game, but don't expect it to be anything like a 50s GTA game.  There's a freeroam option which is mainly used for completing all of the fourty street crimes.  This is a game aimed at a more mature audience due to realistic nature of the investigations.  As others have stated, the investigations can be somewhat repetitive if you complete a lot of them in a row (I'd suggest not to do this obviously).  The graphics look nice for a game released 5 years ago,  and every main case (there's 21 of these cases in total including 5 DLC cases) has unique locations which add a lot to the detective atmosphere.The Rockstar Social Club thing is mandatory and stupidly annoying to some, but there's an easy trick to avoid the ""necessary account creation"":  either disconnect your internet manually with the cable or disable the internet connection on your internet options.  The game will detect your computer has no internet connection, and it will prompt you to create an offline account.  This account only requires you to enter a username, and the game will automatically sign you into the username when you reload the game with or without an internet connection active.I recommend anyone with an interest in detective media to purchase this game, but you should wait for a sale.  It's usually at least 50% off when it is on sale due to its age.  The game still holds up today because of the unique motion capture technology used to simulate the in-game characters.

												On consoles this game is great. On pc it is poorly optimized. I can't use my controller to play because starting the game with it plugged in causes the camera to constantly rotate for no reason even after turnin off auto camera. The 30 fps lock was a bad idea. I understand that the purpose of it is to have the animations work as they are supposed to but it should be an option, not required. After gaming on a Pc anything lower than 40 fps starts to hurt my eyes after some time. I have a gtx 970 and the game sometimes drops to 25 frames and looks miserable. I do love this game though. The thought put behind each case was well done and overall its a pretty good game for its time. Minor adjustments to the Pc version could have made this game great.			",32,4,0,1,0,0,0

												By and large, one of the most interesting games I've played for a long while. Instead of the classic reliance on violence, explosions, car chases, bullet time and skimpily clad anime girls, this game 'ACTUALLY' does what it set out to do, and did it rather well considering just how difficult it must've been to release this in the way it was intended; as a detective simulator.The game has 3 styles in one: Interrogation/Interviewing , Open World Transportation , Crime Scene Investigation.Open World Transportation is rather simple...You drive around in your 1950s or something automobile copcar, with your partner whose usually a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ And you go from place to place depending on where the case takes you, be it a gunshop, a grieving widows home, an axe murderers back yard, or the filthy hard drive of a delusional waifu hunter weeaboo's hard drive(Not really).Crime Scene Investigation is part 2 to Open World Transportation. You arrive at the crime scene, and you wobble around the place looking for clues, such as bloody hand guns, Newspaper clippings, bullet casings, or used condoms with banana flavor (Not really).Interrogation/Interviewing is the selling part of the whole game, and obviously where the most time and effort was dumped in. The faces of the characters in the game were enchanced with live-action motion mapping of an actual actor's face, to help one determine what they're thinking. It makes tell-tale characteristics, like fidget eyes, a nervous lip twitch, or even something subtle like a quivering eyebrow, more evident and easy to determine. In this way, the game went above and beyond, and really makes the process of deciding whether someone is telling the truth or lying, a treat.The graphics are hard to determine in a singular way due to the fact that the developpers have been so picky-choosey with what they focus their attention and effort on. For example, buildings are pretty damned bare-bones. You don't really look at the wall texture and go ""THIS IS AMAZING"", as they never really stand out enough for you to even notice them. They're just there. Cars and bodies are a little bit better, although movement and shooting a hand gun still looks rather robotic and unnatural. Meanwhile, the faces are a whole different level of quality and attention to detail, which honestly looks a bit weird and kind of crappy when you think about it. Crappy everything else, except for the faces which are smooth and perfect in every way?....Talk about playing favorites guys, jeez, at least TRY to make it less painfully obvious next time.All in all, the game's fun, and you'll get tons of hours of fun out of it if you're into detective work and such, but don't be super impressed by the game's execution as a whole. Take it for what it is, a detective simulator. It's not Grand Theft Auto, and don't expect it to be.			",347,65,7,46,45,2,36

Okay... in all seriousness the player character is (mostly) a decent guy, but your fellow policemen tend to be either bitter, corrupt, or narrow-minded. And while the last of those makes sense for the 1940's, it still ensured that my opinion of police in this game is more or less what it is IRL: a handful of good people in a sea of jerks who are no better than the people they throw in jail.Anyway... gamey. You search crime scenes for things, interrogate people about the things you find, and sometimes shoot people since these are American police and they like to do that sort of thing. Though at least in this case all the people you are forced to shoot tend to be firing back at you, so I guess that's justifiable. While the gameplay isn't broken, it just... didn't work for me. I was bored alot of the time and the game choosing to rate my performance promoted save scumming and looking for guides rather than working things out for myself. And while I suppose it is my fault for deciding to skip the ""fun"" of figuring out things for myself, I just felt uninterested and wanted to be done with it all......well, until the late parts of the game, when things heat up and interesting plot stuff actually starts happening. And while the final level is a bit absurd by being a massive gunfight and a rushed ending with alot of unresolved messes, at least the stuff before it was interesting and kept me wanting to see where things would end up.I'm not sure about this game. It felt really long and the first half was profoundly lacking in excitement. I suppose that would be realistic: most police stuff is samey and boring I expect. But the ""realism"" here came at the cost of fun, and I could barely play more than a case at a time before I had to go do something else to entertain myself.But it's not a bad game. It's just not for me. I'll give this a ""yes"" because it works, does get better later on, and that there is no ""maybe"" option on Steam and I don't dislike this game enough to give it a ""no"".Yey... now I can do something else. x_x			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												Really fun detective game, but don't expect it to be anything like a 50s GTA game.  There's a freeroam option which is mainly used for completing all of the fourty street crimes.  This is a game aimed at a more mature audience due to realistic nature of the investigations.  As others have stated, the investigations can be somewhat repetitive if you complete a lot of them in a row (I'd suggest not to do this obviously).  The graphics look nice for a game released 5 years ago,  and every main case (there's 21 of these cases in total including 5 DLC cases) has unique locations which add a lot to the detective atmosphere.The Rockstar Social Club thing is mandatory and stupidly annoying to some, but there's an easy trick to avoid the ""necessary account creation"":  either disconnect your internet manually with the cable or disable the internet connection on your internet options.  The game will detect your computer has no internet connection, and it will prompt you to create an offline account.  This account only requires you to enter a username, and the game will automatically sign you into the username when you reload the game with or without an internet connection active.I recommend anyone with an interest in detective media to purchase this game, but you should wait for a sale.  It's usually at least 50% off when it is on sale due to its age.  The game still holds up today because of the unique motion capture technology used to simulate the in-game characters.

												This is by far the best game I've ever played. I've only had this game for about a week and finished story mode. The story of this game is one of the most intresting stories I've seen. I highly rate this game because of all the action, all the puzzles you have to solve. Everything about this game is perfect. I know some people have the error that it crashes on start up and doesnt give you and error at all, I've actually had that exact error but for some reason after spamming the L.A. Noire icon it eventually opened. I was so happy when it did. I actually was about to give up on this game because I googled it after googling it about the error but I found nothing. Now that it works I'm very happy and this game is probably the best game I've ever played in my entire life so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since there is no neutral rating I guess I'll give this a thumbs up.  But just barely.  The gameplay in Noire gets extremely repetitive.  This is a game best played in short bursts as binge playing will quickly wear on your mind with the same ol' gameplay in every case.  Here is a break down of a typical case:1. Meet the suspect.2. Walk around and press A to interact with stuff.3. Interrogate suspect.4. Leave and drive around to the next clue location.5. Chase suspect on foot until forced to do a driving sequence.NPC's act strange someetimes during interrogations too.  Like when you think they're lying, it turns out it was the truth.  Or, they will do something that will completely incriminate themselves and send them to jail.  Controls are pretty awful.  I can't imagine playing this on a keyboard so I use a controller but it still has tanky controls.  Moving Cole around is very slow and the input is delayed.  Still, the game is fun in short bursts.  If you like the 40's pulp era novel's you'll appreciate the seting in Noir.			",141,39,0,48,7,0,20

												For all it's flaws, I loved L.A. Noire.The port, first off, is woeful. After you've contended with Rockstar Social Club updating and generally being a nuisance, the fight is getting the game looking pretty while keeping the framerate consistent. I played the whole thing through at the locked-in 30fps, and had a fine time.For it's time, this is a beautiful, innovative game. The facial models make characters readable and relatable, and the generally minimalist nature of the game - few HUD features popping in or out, heavy reliance on sound rather than visual signposting - allows the game to unfold like a dense TV series rather than a videogame. The atmosphere is exceptional, and period music and vehicles only add to that.The story is good, although it wanes towards the end. The same goes for the gameplay - it is fun, unique, and rewarding, but also blows its wad off the bat: by the endgame, you're doing the same things you were at the very start.Even still, a fantastic single-player experience.

												Not a very good pc port but god is this game amazing. I really loved the hell out of it even though there was a lot of missed potential. I liked the main character Cole Phelps a lot but plenty of people were mixed on him and I understand why, he should have been characterized a bit more. They hardly show his personal life and they mainly follow him when he's on the job and not when he's at home with his family. There also should've been more to do in the open world and the ending was kinda rushed. I'd give it a 9 out of 10 but I really want to give it a 10 because of how unique and polished the game felt but the lack of characterization for certain characters and a lack of open world side content brings it down a bit. Really recommend it, it's one of my all time favorites.			",116,11,0,26,3,0,13

												Set in the 1950s Los Angeles and in the aftermath of World War II, Team Bondi conceived an amazing game that balances between cinematography and mystery-solving. This game require intuition and patience as the gameplay focuses mainly on collecting clues & evidences and judging suspect’s statements.The storyline mainly focuses on Cole Phelps, a dishonored World War II veteran and an ambitious yet intuitive LAPD detective. Cole Phelps started as a simple patrolman, but with time, he showed initiative and solved his first murder case, and gained his Captain’s attention. Not long, he got promoted to the Traffic Desk solving more cases, and cases after cases he is now a member of the infamous Vice squad.You will also briefly follow the footsteps of Jack Kelso, Phelps' old friend and arson investigator. Near the end of the game, you will be contacted and hired to investigate a house fire, but along the way, you will uncover the dark intentions of a certain building contractor, and offered a new job as the DA's investigator.The gameplay is based on ""Cases"", but most people would call them ""Missions"". Here, you will be taken to Cole Phelps' consciousness and try to solve said cases with your partner. You will start in the briefing room, the Captain will give you a new case, and you will have to drive to the crime scene, search for clues, question or interrogate suspects and witnesses, fight and occasionaly kill uncooperative suspects, and calling R&I. Your standard issue notebook contains all informations regarding to the case, and Detective Phelps will write down new clues and persons of interest. Each actions will result in a different outcome of the case (You arrested the wrong person, the true suspect escaped, etc.) but said outcomes will result only but slightly to the next case dialogue, unfortunately.The action sequences include on-foot pursuits, vehicle pursuits, fist-fights, and shootouts. Amidst the cases, you can respond to street crimes. (robbery, shootouts, etc.) The interrogation sequence is unique. When intercepted with a dispute, wou will be given three options, which is Truth, Doubt, and Lie. The first two options are pretty self-explanatory, but the third option, to prove that someone is lying, you must present adquate evidence regarding his/her statement. You can also judge the P.O.I's statement by carefully watching their facial cues. (some suspects are far more resilient than others though).If you have completed a ""Desk"" or even all cases available, and if you are bored, you can select ""The Streets Of L.A."" which is a free-roam mode for you to collect gold film reels, collect cars, respond to street crimes, or just simply sightseeing.The storyline also features flashbacks of Cole's war-time adventures, and these flashbacks will cross paths with the main storyline and the ending would place the final piece of the puzzle.An amazing game of it's time.Ten out of ten.

												What an incredible game. Been playing for 30 hours now and haven't finished it yet. Still have a couple of cases to go and some street crimes.Edit: Finished the game 100% and managed to get every achievement. Loved every minute of it.When you first play the game, the story might go a bit slow, but it doesn't take long before you get sucked into the whole story and drama. For those who are looking for some kind of shooter and/or action game, you've come to the wrong place. L.A. Noire is a detective game and meanwhile there are moments you end up in a gunfight or a car chase, basically the game is about finding every clue and correctly interrogate every suspect. This is what makes the game so much fun and unique. It's something I've never experienced before.And not just that. Every case just gets more and more interesting. Heck, some of them are even close to disturbing. L.A. Noire isn't afraid to hold back.Another thing I love in this game is that the music really helps you. Like when you are walking around on a crimescene, looking for clues, just listen to the music. It will give you a hint where to find things. Same goes for the interrogations. The music (or more like a jingle) will let you know if you, for example, correctly accused someone of lying. Of course, when you do the latter, you have to make sure you have the right evidence to back up your accusation, which is another thing what makes L.A. Noire so much fun.The whole atmosphere of the game is nicely done as well. L.A. Noire takes places in the 1940's and (like the title already suggests) in Los Angeles. I really enjoyed roaming the streets in those wonderful cars (and I'm not even a car-fan!). Roaming the streets (of even just going to the next location for your case) can be dangerous though. One of the things I really, really disliked where all those other people ingame, on the streets. The traffic is horrible, cars just run into you or stop right in front of you for no reason. And sometimes it doesn't even help to turn on the sirens. Some people even JUMP right in front of your car. So yeah, driving around in L.A. Noire can be very frustrating.Another thing I had to get used to were the graphics. They aren't bad, but they aren't very lovely either. At first it kind of had this cardboard-feeling. And it took me a while to get used to the faces, in the beginning I just kept thinking ""what is going on with their mouths?"". But, it turned out that the way the creators of L.A. Noire used expressions on the faces worked very well. The faces are very expressive and can really help you out during interrogations.Overall L.A. Noire is a really great game, which I have enjoyed so very much (and still am!). It's been a while since I've been so enthousiastic about a game. I definitely recommend this game.Pros:Strong storyAll the casesInterrogation systemAtmosphereMusicGreat main character, very likableFacial expressionsThe carsCons:TrafficTrafficTRAFFIC (especially pedestrians)Moving, sometimes you get stuck ",150,18,1,20,26,0,15

I do highly recommened a guide when you take on the investigations though as some entire story arcs depends on a SINGLE question being asked in a certain way.

The 40s, filled with Thompson submachine guns, mafias as well as the old cars.I Would definitely get this game on the Steam Sales given the amount of effort placed in by the creators.

												L.A Noire is a game set in Los Angeles after World War II, during the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"". You play as Cole Phelps, a detective who must work his way through the LAPD, solving cases and making arrests. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I sincerely congratulate Rockstar on their fine work.Firstly, it should be known that the voicework and character animations in this game are fantastic; without this, the game wouldn't work half as well as it did. The characters move and interact seamlessly, due to the innovative use of motion capture technology. During interviews, the player has to read into facial expressions and determine whether a suspect is lying or telling the truth. Due to the impressive animations on display, you can read every eye twitch, uneasy posture and downward glance. These interview sections are the highlight of the game, and it was genuinely entertaining to complete them using evidence and intuition.The basic game mechanics function just like any other Rockstar game; a large (beautifully made) open world, in this case, the grime and glamour of 1950's Los Angeles. You can roam the city on foot or in a vehicle, resolving street crime cases and responding to pleas for police intervention. During a case, you'll often have to travel around the city to meet suspects and other characters, so you'll easily notice the size and attention to detail put into the open world. Additionally, during a case you have to analyse different pieces of evidence, and you'll quickly learn how to integrate these pieces of evidence into the case. It was truly immersive to act like a proper detective, and fans of old crime shows will be delighted here.Without giving anything away, the story is quite investing, and you'll find yourself truly interested in Cole Phelps' story. I don't want to spoil anything, but Rockstar really knows how to make a decent narrative.The only flaw with this game is the horrible optimisation for PC; the graphics are high quality and very consistent, but the port is not well optimised at all. I can barely maintain an acceptable framerate throughout the game, but I persisted due to the quality of the game content. This may be my own error due to using an AMDD Graphics card.Overall, L.A Noire is a highly worthwhile and entertaining experience. The immersive story and gameplay really held me right to the end, but the poor optimisation is the only thing holding this game back from a 10. Well crafted, and I'd love to see a sequel to this one. 9.5 / 10			",310,28,9,21,14,0,36

												A masterpiece falling short.Had a long think about this review. The technology is nothing short of breathtaking and well worth it as a tour de force of what great tech can add to a game.The gameplay feature of reading the charactors tells is, i think, a great inovation and also, a difficult whip to crack. It can feel a little lopsided as some of the acting i over egged and thus paints the conversion as somewhat bipolar. Although this could of been negated by yet more acting, I can understand that the complexity of such would of either burnt out the actors or moved the game into a different year for completion. I've heard of the heartache associated with the production of the game and can understand why. Its easy to dismiss when coming from a place of ignorance with some of those slight bugs but when looked at as a whole, the game broke some ground, not only in gameplay but technology aswell, not to mention tying them together. I applaud the huge undertaking this game was. One thing that was a little underwhelming though.....the driving... its not a driving game as we already know, its really a detective game but the driving elements, for me, could of been more fun with you being driven around rather than do the driving. I like driving games but when the driving is profuctory rather than part of the game, its best left out. Would of really enjoyed being driven around and take in the sights, scouting for suspects etc....perhaps have a little gun fight along the way etc. I think that would of lended better to a detective game than a sort of limited driving sim with lowend mechanics. Last thoughts, although the main portion of development missed the driving aspects its understandable when you have such attention paid to a rather breathtaking level of charactor detail and nuance.

												I'd forgotten how much of an immersive and distinctive storytelling experience L.A. Noire is in the four years since I completed it on the Xbox 360. It's essentially a hardboiled detective novel brought to life in a highly cinematic gaming experience. I just picked up the complete edition on sale for dirt cheap, and before I knew it, I was spellbound and had spent the entire evening playing it for several hours straight in a single sitting. As the minutes turned into hours, I found myself once again drawn into the game's shadowy world of vice, corruption, and murder that brilliantly captures the atmosphere of 1950s Los Angeles in a medium it had never been explored. The narrative revolves around one main character and a few minor ones and slowly (some would say tediously; this is not a typical open world sandbox game, so don't approach it like one...it requires patience and an open mind) progresses through a series of cases in which you repeat many of the same gameplay elements (inspect crime scenes for clues, go to new locations they lead you to, track down and interrogate suspects, and rinse & repeat in various orders with some chase & gunfight sequences thrown in for pacing as well as optional dispatch missions you can take on in the middle of a case), but the writing, variety of rich settings, and overall presentation are top notch and keep the formula fresh and the mysteries (both in individual missions and the overarching story) tantalizing regardless of linearity. The graphics have aged a bit (even running on maximum settings, pop-in is more evident, draw distance is shorter, and environmental textures that comprise foliage & buildings are much less detailed than the current standards), but none of that detracts from the experience or the dense, vibrant world and performances that made this game so great back in 2011. The motion capture technology it employs is still great, allowing it to showcase very nuanced facial expressions. This PC port is optimized very well, running at a high, stable frame rate and improving on an already visually compelling console game.If you haven't played this yet, I highly recommend it, especially since you can now get the complete package for around $5 which includes the original four standalone DLC missions and two previously console-exclusive missions that are inserted into the campaign, making this akin to a director's cut. A smart, savvy game with dark themes for mature audiences.			",380,123,5,39,23,5,49

												L.A Noire is a game set in Los Angeles after World War II, during the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"". You play as Cole Phelps, a detective who must work his way through the LAPD, solving cases and making arrests. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I sincerely congratulate Rockstar on their fine work.Firstly, it should be known that the voicework and character animations in this game are fantastic; without this, the game wouldn't work half as well as it did. The characters move and interact seamlessly, due to the innovative use of motion capture technology. During interviews, the player has to read into facial expressions and determine whether a suspect is lying or telling the truth. Due to the impressive animations on display, you can read every eye twitch, uneasy posture and downward glance. These interview sections are the highlight of the game, and it was genuinely entertaining to complete them using evidence and intuition.The basic game mechanics function just like any other Rockstar game; a large (beautifully made) open world, in this case, the grime and glamour of 1950's Los Angeles. You can roam the city on foot or in a vehicle, resolving street crime cases and responding to pleas for police intervention. During a case, you'll often have to travel around the city to meet suspects and other characters, so you'll easily notice the size and attention to detail put into the open world. Additionally, during a case you have to analyse different pieces of evidence, and you'll quickly learn how to integrate these pieces of evidence into the case. It was truly immersive to act like a proper detective, and fans of old crime shows will be delighted here.Without giving anything away, the story is quite investing, and you'll find yourself truly interested in Cole Phelps' story. I don't want to spoil anything, but Rockstar really knows how to make a decent narrative.The only flaw with this game is the horrible optimisation for PC; the graphics are high quality and very consistent, but the port is not well optimised at all. I can barely maintain an acceptable framerate throughout the game, but I persisted due to the quality of the game content. This may be my own error due to using an AMDD Graphics card.Overall, L.A Noire is a highly worthwhile and entertaining experience. The immersive story and gameplay really held me right to the end, but the poor optimisation is the only thing holding this game back from a 10. Well crafted, and I'd love to see a sequel to this one. 9.5 / 10			",310,28,9,21,14,0,36

												Love the visuals. The voice acting and usage of facial implementation in this game is outstanding. Having a setting in the 1940s Los Angeles really works well for a free-roaming detective story.The gameplay can be tricky at times, especially with a gamepad. If you're not used to shooting with lock features, it may lead to frustration.Because of said visuals, it can really show its difficulty when it comes to investigations and interviews, as it is a factor: collecting clues, getting information from witnesses, all to get a perfect case performance. You're not supposed to rely completely on memory to succeed, but rather your awareness on scenes, faces and possible evidence.There's no trigger happy experience for Grand Theft Auto or Postal fans. It seems that the branded cars, food products and other memorable landmarks in the city are the spotlights of the game.			",393,92,24,34,29,5,37

												Excellent. Wonderful investigations with varied outcomes. I do highly recommened a guide when you take on the investigations though as some entire story arcs depends on a SINGLE question being asked in a certain way. Visually nice, not modern though anymore. Good voice acting. Great driving, acceptable gun play. Basically a GTA title if GTA had more self respect, meaning not EVERYONE in LA Noire is a scumbag.

												I felt the need to beat the game before I wrote a review on it just so I could get a full-scale view on it. I think I've put about 27 hours into the game before I finally did beat it (and that's without any DLC), so if you're looking for a long game that is worth your money, then L.A. Noire should definitely be considered. You play as Cole Phelps, a war veteran that has returned to the States to enlist as a police officer in Los Angeles. Throughout the game, you will solve cases by collecting evidence around crimescenes, conducting interviews on suspects or witnesses, and driving around the city. Lots and LOTS of driving (Since driving will take up a large chunk of time, the game allows you to ""fast Travel"" to the selected area by holding ""E"" next to the car). Every so often, you'll get promoted and moved to a different set of cases (Such as Arson, Homicide, and *Motor Crime*). *I'm not familiar with what Motor Crime is known under*Phelps' life in the war is shown through flashbacks between each case, slowly placing the parts to make a giant picture.The gameplay is pretty simple:  You are assigned a case and you must piece together the clues to solve it. L.A. Noire offers many features that aren't availible in other detective/mystery games. First, the map. L.A. Noire is a gigantic free-roam map (you'll mainly be driving) that takes a LONG time to drive from one side to the other, even going 80 mph. The city is filled, and I mean FILLED with AI life that walks or drives along through the city, making it feel like an actual city. Many of the places on the map are real places or based on real places that were/are in Los Angeles as well. Another feature that I must mention is the interrogation. When you interrogate a person, you will ask them a question, to which they will respond with an answer. You then must decide if they are telling the truth, if you doubt them, or if they are lying (and you can prove that they are lying). You can decide these based on evidence you had found at a crime scene and by looking at the amazing facial expressions the character emits. For example, if a character is staring straight at you while talking, they're probably telling the truth, while if a character keeps avoiding eye contact, you might want to push for more information. The facial expressions in the game are spectacular and the mouth-to-voice dialog is spot-on. Yes, they deserved their own little two-sentence paragraph right here, that's how good they are.I got 27 hours out of the campaign and bought it while it was on sale for $10. After playing, I know that I would have bought it for the full price, due to the well-planned and just delicate features that the game highlights. I must mention one bug that I had with the game...at times, the game would run slow. Most of the time, it ran smoothly and I had no problem with it, but at times, (when Rockstar was busy perhaps) the game would be slightly laggy. Not enough to make the game unplayable, but enough to be quite annoying. Fortunately, if I left and came back a few hours later, I would experience no lag. Finally, I want to promote the different action there is. Often while working a case, you'll be driving and get a call over the radio to respond to a street crime, essentially a side mission. There are many different types of action you will face in the game. There are car chases, police shootouts, tracking missions (missions where you follow the suspect without being seen), running-for-your-life-missions, and many more.Overall, I give the game a 9/10.

												Hats Off to Rockstar and Team Bondi. They created a masterpiece using the best of technology available in 2011. Its not the standard Rockstar GTA type of game where you can just shoot anyone and keep playing missions. Its more like a movie and the game makes you feel as though you are in a 1940s movie. You play an LAPD Cop names Cole Phelps who is a war veteran.Others might have mentioned this but i'll still go on to say it one more time that the facial expression and acting is absolutely phenomenal.The technology used in the game makes the people in the game extremely realistic and the acting of the actors who were motion-captured is very impressive.It is a classic noire themed Game. Everything is perfect from Background music to plot of the game. The jazz music got me addicted.Gameplay: The game play is great, With the new motion capture technology it is fun to investigate the crime scene. Note:The PC port of this game is not too good. The game seems to be locked at 30 FPS; even on the best of computers, you might not have a consistent and smooth experienceOverall rating - 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very good game,the story is very nice but sometimes it gets hard and annoying with the puzzles but you can always use a guide which makes it easy.The voice acting are also good.Some people say that rockstar club is annoying in the game but No,all we got to do is simply sign in and it won't bother you,rockstar club account also helps you to track your game progress in cases,street crimes,Vehicles etc... when you are done with the story there are 40 street crimes which are also fun.It feels good to play in old times in LA.✓ Great story 10/10✓ Great voice acts 10/10✓ Good graphic 9/10✓ Longer play time 9/10✓ Does not get boring 10/10✖ Sometimes the puzzles are annoying (you can use a guide which will make it easy)10/10 Nice and unique game worth trying ",125,31,5,12,10,3,8

It's a movie, it's a novel, it's a TV-serie, it's a puzzle, it's a tragedy, it's a fiction, it's the truth. Playing a sandbox game as a good policeman is something you will get use to easily.In the beginning you probably will find the game hard to play and have success in; but when you get into it, you will wonder the finale as much as you will wish that it won't end.Buy it if your rig is enough.*  You don't need to wait for Steam Sales to come.* LA Noire has average optimisation. It uses constant 30 FPS because of its technology. When/if you get 25- FPS, it may hurt your eyes. Having a recommended system will solve your problem. ",261,50,8,23,22,7,27

												I have to admit I'm quite a sucker for Rockstar games.  I played All GTA games (except 5), all Max Payne games, And some of the Midnight Club and Manhunt games.  When I decided to play this game I knew I'll love it. I knew it from the day I heard of it. And I do.  L.A. Noire has an unique noire feeling that actually make you think you are there and everything seems very real and alive. Unlike GTA where you (or at least I don't) don't actually care much about many of the characters you encounter, here you literally have to discover the life of every victim to solve the case and the fact that you see the victim covered in blood and all beat up makes it more real and somehow personal.  The more you play, the violent the murders are and this makes you really wanna get the murderer and kick his #$@!.  The game comes with an awesome soundtrack and offers an extra goodie - you can actually play the game in grayscale.Literally noire. This is the only game with this kind of feature I've encountered so far.  Unfortunatelly, L.A. Noire revealed again (if this was ever the case) that Rockstar #$#% at porting games to PC. In the past few years I noticed that every new Rockstar PC port is worse than the old one and so on.  But L.A. Noire is by far the worst port ever, technically speaking.  I haven't encounter gameplay bugs but the game is not fluid and has serious FPS drops when you least expect it. You get to see trees and cars and houses materializing up out of thin air (the effect is interesting - unlike GTA where those actually popped up, here I see a Star Trek teleport-like effect :|) Moreover, It doesn't seem to get better when lowering the settings.  In the end, I really want to downvote this game but I can't. Despite it's technical issues, L.A. Noire is a really unique game.			",517,131,14,53,33,4,81

												L.A. Noire is a dark, stylish game not really like anything else by Rockstar Games. Instead of being the anti-hero, you play as beat policeman and war veteran Cole Phelps in his mission up the LAPD ranks. The game looks decent enough for its age. The real advertised feature of this game was the facial capture, which is extremely well done, even in gameplay. However, this comes with two critical drawbacks. Firstly, in order for the animations to keep up, the game is capped at a ""cinematic"" 30FPS, so for many PC gamers, it may not seem like it runs very well. Secondly, although the faces are extremely detailed and animated, the bodies lack this advanced animation. Because of that, the model quality seems very inconsistent, especially when someone is lying, as their bodies hardly move, or flail around unrealistically, while their faces are completely animated. To substitute for this, some actors decided to do extremely over-the-top telltale facial signs to show lying, as they could not effectively communicate this with their body language. Other than these drawbacks, engine and visual wise, the game is fine, with a detailed, stylised city to roam around in.The soundtrack and audio in general for the game is superb. The soundtrack fits well with the theme, and the radio is authentic era radio broadcasts, and brilliant voice acting mean that the game is brilliant in the audio department, which really helps with the 'immersion' (sorry for using a buzzword) when playing the game.Gameplay wise, despite the more focused story, it plays a bit like Grand Theft Auto when roaming the city. This isn't really a bad thing, as the gameplay feels familiar and flows correctly to allow L.A. Noire to be an easy game to pick up and start playing. This does bring in another small problem though, the investigating. Because there are a lot of gamers now, many of them may not be that good at the old adventure-game style gaming. In order to compensate for this, Rockstar and Team Bondi implemented a lot of hand-holding functions, which unfortunately prevents the gameplay from reaching its true maximum potential. The game never becomes complex, and investigations are held back by lack of difficulty and consequence.Despite these drawbacks, the game, considering the average triple-A games of today, is unique, especially when stood side-by-side with Rockstar's more famous work. The attention to detail and appealing gameplay, along with the brilliant audio and focus on story means that despite its flaws, I have no problem recommending this game to people who want to play a modern adventure game.

												Wow, what a spectacularly dull game. To all those complaining you can't get it to launch, youse are the lucky ones... well that's not true but the game's not great. First of all Cole Phelps is just an extremely dulll and unlikeable character. His smug, smarmy facial expressions are captured perfectly with the only real reason to take a glance at this game. The facial animation is still better than most today however the texture quality has not aged well and coupled with the choppy framerate it just doesn't look as good as it once would've. The story doesn't seem to be going anywhere interesting after more than six hours (I've played an hour or two offline as well), it just seems to be a kind of episodic deal. Crime or two, promotion, another crime or two. If you're into detective stuff and noir style then maybe, just maybe you can get into this as there is kind of a gap in the market for this stuff. Just don't expect much in the way of action.This game essentially plays itself during any action sequences. You just hold the trigger down and move forward until the other guy stops running. The shooting is very basic, not bad in any real way, there's just nothing to it. There's nothing really noteworthy to say about the driving either. The meat of the gameplay is the detective stuff. This consists primarily of listening to people talk and using the advanced facial capture stuff to read faces and determine if they're lying, with the help of evidence and context of course. Oh and bad acting works to your advantage too sometimes. You literally just pick Truth, Doubt or Lie which is just doubt but you have to pick a bit of evidence to back it up. You also walk around picking things up and looking at them with great interest. The thing that bugged me the most with this is the fact that it immediately tells you if you got the dialogue tree wrong which just compels me to retry until I get it right and subsequently I end up hearing the same bits of dialogue a dozen times. It'd be more immersive if it just sort of went forward with no specific indication, at least not until the end of the case. For the last one I just used a walkthrough but that made it thrice as boring which is when I realised that I was not enjoying it enough to play anymore.Long story short, don't play it if you're autistic.

												Intially i played this on ps3 and stopped pretty early on found it boring and repetetive. fast foward 3 years from now and have seen the light. This a fantastic game with an amazing attention of detail (Cole phelps picking his hat after being punched, details in interiors)) The settings is amazing the ACTED not voice acted but ACTED has to be the most ambitious thing ever. There isnt much gun fights or standard action but uses common sense an paying attention this fits to more of a older point and click adventure game. On the port side the port is awful. Frequent frame drops crashes and stuttering so i reccomend you get the console version. Overall this has to be my favorite games ever!			",162,11,5,6,9,2,4

												I liked this game.  Probably the best detective game I have played since the Gabriel Knight Series  (which was just re-released this past week).  It can be a little racy at times with stereotypes, language and nudity so it is definitely not for the under 16 set or those that find that subject matter offensive.   But I especially enjoy racing from map end to map end trying to see how fast i can go and trying out different vehicles.  I remember taking a International truck from the Railroad Depot crime scene and had my partner quip, ""Really Cole?  What are people going to think when we show up in this thing.""  Also funny quips in coroner, crime scene vehicles and others.Well worth the money especially if you can get it on one of the sales they have it on it from time to time.   Some people do have a problem with playing the game on the default parameters, but you can quickly change a few things out and get up to speed in very little time by monkeying with the DX, thread and other graphic settings.

												Let's start with the graphics. For starters I was actually amazed that L.A. Noire was the first console game that had near-flawless if not flawless anti-aliasing. I kid you not, you could take a look at the telephone wires from up close or from afar and there would be no jaggies. Nevertheless, I attempted to convince myself that my mind was playing tricks on me and that some anti-alised objects were just polished to perfection. I was partially right; it's only the telephone wires, cars and some other objects that have no jaggies.The graphics settings for the PC version are:Antialiasing: 1-3Anisotropic Filtering: 1-4Ambient Occlusion - Yes/NoFacial Quality - Quality/PerformanceTexture Quality - Quality/PerformanceShadow Quality - Quality/Performance/BalancedLighting Quality - Quality/Performance/BalancedEnvironment Map - Quality/Performance/BalancedLevel of Detail Quality - Quality/Performance/BalancedScreen Space Ambient Occlusion - On/OffGlobal Detail Level - Quality/Performance/BalancedAnd there's also a command line for various set-up options.If you have a high end PC you can get 30 FPS if you pick all Quality.However, if you choose Performance, you ALSO get 30 FPS.So they converted the game to PC yet they forgot to raise the FPS cap, hmmm weird. Honestly, I did not notice much difference between the PS3 and the PC version graphic-wise. I mean all those extra graphics options are nice for the ego-boost but I had a hard time telling the difference especially with the frequent texture popping.What I mean is that the game's graphics suffer immensely when you drive your vehicle for instance. Objects just pop out of thin air and grow out of the ground slowly enough for you to notice. You may drive and look ahead at some of the box-like buildings when all of a sudden they begin to acquire the necessary features such as windows, doors, color, etc.Also, in many instances the game practically plays by itself. Again, that was done with the controller movement in mind. You may run after someone through the rooftops, fire escape ladders, alleyways and what not and be automatically redirected to pursue the suspect. The game GUIDES you forces you after the suspect because it assumes you may not be able to make that sharp turn with your controller; all you'll have to hold is the ""forward"" button.-----Part 2Make no mistake, this is not GTA set in the 1940's. There are no friends to call, bars, memorable and charismatic characters, outrageous cinematics, funny encounters, motorcycles, TV shows, dating, witty radio broadcasts describing the decadent elements of American Culture. This is a very mature, somewhat dry and serious game, perhaps it is too serious. There is a fair amount of thin adult humor that might not even catch your attention but the dialogue is extremely well written to say the least. The game plays and feels just like one of those black and white detective movies. Maybe the game is too serious in fact, there is little room for fun. Nor is there a single set objective mission to complete per se. You just keep the L.A. populace safe from petty and serious criminals.If anything, the game is divided into chapters much like in Mafia 2 and there are some miscellaneous missions to complete aside from the main story. Each story starts with a few seconds video showing what happens to the victim. There are actually clues within those short videos that might help you solve the crime better and faster. So this is like a sand box game with no toys to play. Sure there are 30 secret cars spread out around the city to find and there are badges and newspapers to look for (if you like achievements) but otherwise there is little to do in the city.The driving is very unrealistic, it feels arcadish but at least you don't get annoyed every time you try to make a sharp turn and attempt to regain controls. However this unrealistic consolish driving feels out of place in this serious game. I guess they had to make it easy for the controller. At first you may think to yourself ""wow, how did I manage to make that turn, not run over the pedestrian and still be able to pursue that vehicle"" - again, the game helps you do all that.For the most part the shooting is okay except when it's not. True, I still prefer the mouse to a controller but once you enter a confined area, the constricted camera speed will force to you aim as slowly as you would with one of those analog sticks.Crime-solving is where the game shines, or supposed to shine at least. Sometimes it will get tedious and samey even though the scenery, the objects, the part of town and the characters are different. At least it got tedious sometimes in my case because I had to pay attention to almost everything. If you have an analytical mind, it will help. If you have a short-attention spam, then good luck. Every case requires your utmost attention and even if you mess up with most clues, facts and interrogations you will still complete the mission only with a low rank. As a result, you will advance slightly slower in the game and have access to less suits, fame and what not. So there is no real sense of danger or fear of messing up HOWEVER you cannot reload your game if the interrogation goes awry for one reason or another, not unless you want to start the chapter all over again. So there is plenty of incentive to not mess up; you want gain those experience points and exchange them for intuition or ask the community option to help you conduct interrogations more effectively.In the end, the 6-year period to make the game and a million dollar debt among other things forced Rockstar to close down their Team Bondi Studio. What can I say, next time, try to make the game faster and RELEASE THE PC VERSION ALONG WITH THE CONSOLE VERSION TO INCREASE THE REVENUE.Thank you very much.			",373,36,1,24,8,2,38

												The first few hours, I found myself genuinely interested but that slowly dwindled away as I realized the game was the same mechanic, wash and repeat for 50 hours. The plot was somewhat complex, which I admire, however it became incredibly absurd. At one point, the main character suddenly does something completely out-of-character and way out in left field.Honestly, the facial animations are good but the face textures are just god awful that it takes away. The city feels barren, the color palette is lackluster, the npcs all seemingly have the same lines, driving from point A to point B was incredibly boring, and I could go on and on. This is a complete game, but man what a borefest. I found myself anticipating the ending so much just so I could get my closure and move on.			",240,92,7,25,35,2,27

												        Okay let us get started with this.This game has a great story, amazing gameplay, stupendous voice acting and outstanding facial animations. One of the best games out there along with GTA 5. This game is a pure classic.        HOWEVER, HOWEVER, HOWEVER, there is one thing about L.A. Noire that pisses me off tremendously. The game is capped at 30 frames per second. As a PC gamer with a powerful rig, this pisses me off because i play most of my games (90% of them) at 60 fps and higher. Playing at 30 fps did not seem right at all. It feels sluggish, and it does not look smooth at all (to me at least).          Nonetheless, you can uncap the framerate by using WideScreenFixer. You will be able to play it at 60 fps if your PC is powerful enough but then uncapping the framerate would mess up one thing. The driving. Driving is one of the key elements of this game and after you have uncapped the framerate, driving physics will be slightly altered. It will be harder to drive around as the vehicle will feel ""floaty"" like how the driving in GTA 4 feels like. But if you can get used to that, then there should not be a problem at all.          That would be the only issue in this game so if you can overcome it, you will have a great experience playing it. I would definitely persuade anyone out there to purchase L.A. Noire.

												This is really quite sad example of how the game industry sometimes works. The game may not be on the top shelf of quality, barely fitting 'the solid-good' one. And yet it IS a good game. And not in the way of 'guilty pleasure' good, no. This title is a great example of a sereis in which the second one corrects every mistake of the first one. Unfortunatelly we do not have the possibility to play second one and we are left with this flawed piece of a 'sketch'. And whilst it is a quite nice idea for a drawing, it is not by any means perfect one. Starting with a mediocre graphics, very hard to rate depending on which side we are looking at (faces and interiors are really nice, the rest is... meh). The gameplay is I'd say quite poor and very repetitive. And yet this title took more than 20 hours of my life. And I do not regret it at all. Because as far as the plot, the character, the music adn the climat goes the game is just outstanding! I could really, (without any problems whatsoever) close an eye on a technical side in this case. Take it without a hesitation if you are the player for whom the story development is more important than a gameplay. Especially if you liked the Sabouteur and you are keen on the 40s, noire, and jazz			",107,22,1,8,7,2,26

												This game was awesome during the seemingly Tutorial. Everything seemed smart and clueful. But a few missions into the detective game and I am frustrated by trying to get a perfect case in an bull**** rigged question and answer system. In this 'case', I refer to the Ambassador's stolen car The consul's car.When talking to a witness, you get 3 choices of answers: Truth; Doubt; Lie. But in this certain case, I doubt the witnessess are telling the truth, and I have no proof he and she are lieing, so I choose doubt. My guy blows his top and calls the witnesses liars, and the game tells me I failed to choose correctly. So I restart the case many times. Finally I chose that the witness is telling the Truth. My guy calmly tells the witness he is lyeing, and the witness confesses and gives more evidence. Game tells me I chose correctly this time. WTF!?!?! This is bull****!!! The two answers are backwards, but are scripted as if it were correct. This kept happening during this certain case, and I have to wonder if the rest of the cases are also scripted to mess with the player instead of acting correctly. Its so frustrating to be told you are wrong when you were correct, and slapped on the wrist for it, until you answer incorrectly and are rewarded for it.The fun parts though are the action scenes if you are driving a squad car. You stop for a bank robbery and kill all the bank robbers in 40 seconds. Then you wish there were 10 more bank robbers so you felt it was a challenge. Most of the time there seemed to be 4 bank robbers, but then there were 5 or 6 the last time, so I hope that my level increases the difficulty of the action scenes. On the downfall, most of the action scenes are incredibly easy. I assume its because I learned the controls really well, but I hope they get incredibly difficult.The worst part was running the case again forces you to re-live the entire storyline times X. There is no scene skipping, EVER! I looked on the RockStar page and someone asked for a kb key to press to skip scenes and they said backspace, and this was also shown in the control options. But backspace does not work! So... replay 25 minutes of scene footage to get to the part where you ask 3 questions to a witness again. Aaarrgghh!! Now this is frustrating. I wish it told me what I was going to say before I chose an option. Like:Truth: I bet you know more than you are letting on.Doubt: You know you are lieing, tell me the truth!Lie: You're lieing! I have proof you did it in the lounge with the candlestick!but... it doesn't. You have to play 25 minutes to see what you are going to say during a questioning.Cons:Citizens look too much alike. I question one citizen, and in the next case there is another citizen who looks exactly like the previous citizen. I don't get it... in a small town, or a big city, all main characters should look unique. At least change their clothes and their hair.Backwards choices.Catching bad guys not involved in your case does not lead to opening new cases against them.Unlock cars by stealing them. Can't buy them.No money system. Except for some sort of city damages that doesn't seem to affect you.Easy action missions.Can't skip scenes.Can't skip chatting.No reason to explore the world if its not involved in your own mission.Can't use your gun, unless the game makes you take it out. And its not wise to use your gun even when the game forces you to take it out.Can't pull your fists out, unless the game makes you.Your guy yells at people on his own. You aren't controlling him. Its a movie, not a game.Mini-map does not rotate. No options for the mini-map.Large map takes 2 seconds to load, and 3 clicks to get back to game, which is 8 seconds. This is frustrating since there is no GPS. You are likely to drive into a long tunnel, instead of going towards your destination.As you play, you realize there is less and less of a reason to explore anything unless it is literally handed to you. (Marked for inspection at the scene by a previous officer.) (Look for shining objects, cause if its not shining then its not ever important.)Many items to inspect are blocked by other items to inspect, making it hard to inspect even if you know that it is there to inspect. a missing flag on an argentinian ambassador's car is blocked by a missing license plate. This type of clue blocking happens in many cases.Can't look at your watch in game.Can't tell what date it is. But many records of the date when someone signed something.Pros:Feeling you are smart when you catch someone in a lie. (If the game feels like being truthful.)Open world.Environment feels real, where there are loads of things to look at, but seldom does anything belong to the case you are working on. You get used to this, and stop looking at things that don't belong to any case ever.Game is set before finger printing, and everyone grabs a gun and fingers the crap out of it no matter what. Game shows how a police officer can walk right into anyone's house if they are invited inside for a different reason, then beat up the citizen and search his house for any reason what-so-ever. No need for warrants when police are invited inside.70+ cars to unlock.Fun (but easy) action missions.No GPS guidance, because you are in the 1940's.tl;drAll in all... I feel to answer what you want to answer, you need a walk-through. But this goes against playing the game and sleuthing! Why not just watch a youtube video of this game instead?If the game had a second tutorial on how to think like the developers thought that investigators should interogate citizens, then this game could have been a ton of fun and a shining star. Otherwise, you are left with writers trying to outsmart a player through cheap tricks. And by tricks I mean: thinking you Doubt someone, so you say Truth so that you ""Doubt"". ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Pros  There's a big world for you to explore. The clue solving and lie dector gameplay is entertaining The street crime (minigames?) are really fun It tells good stories (I'm not sure if there is an over-arching plot)  Cons   While the world is big, there is NOTHING to do outside of the main objective and street crimes.  The lie dector gameplay is broken and gets stale fast. you can click lie for everything, it will go through a scripted sequence, and if you're wrong, you simpily take the statement back. Also I couldn't tell the answer 99% of the time just based on their face.  There are a few street crimes and they get looped after a while (I liked them, but after the 100th time they're no fun)  You only get your gun in (some) street crimes (and maybe a few missions)  The characters aren't fleshed out enough (Partners are jerks that have no real purpose and switch after a few missions. The main character has no real background story with the exception of the war flashbacks that happen inbetween missions)  The controls are slippery (cars feel like they have butter under the tires and the character movement is awful in a way I cannot explain). OVERALL L.A. Noire is an interesting game that is fun, but only for a few hours. I can only recommend it if it goes on sale for $5 or if you're a real fan of 1950s(?) detective games. Don't buy this.

												L.A. Noire attempts to adopt an open-world style gameplay, and in some way, succeeds. However, the repetitive gameplay that surrounds and revolves around flipping clues around in your hand and judging whether someone is lying or not from their ambiguous facial expressions, lets the game down as it quickly became more of a bore than wanting more. The campaign experience was not all that disappointing though, because having an interest in the crime/mystery genre certainly allowed for some wider imagination. 7/10			",110,15,1,2,8,0,12

The setting is perfect, recreating 1940s LA down to the fashion, music, and nuances of the time. Well worth it's ~30hr playtime including the DLC, which comes in the Complete Edition and should be the version to get if you are considering buying the game.			",369,164,4,37,29,5,34

Even if you are not a huge crime drama fan, La Norie is still made by Rockstar so there's plenty of things from the story to the gameplay that will keep you hooked until the very end. You play as Cole Phelps, a military veteran that returned to LA as a police officer. You solve cases and go up in ranks. Each case as a unqiue twist and all need speical attention if you want to get the right guy. If you ever thought about how cool it would be to work as a detective than do yourself a favor and pick up this game !			",71,8,3,11,25,1,23

												This is yet another masterpiece of a game delivered by Rockstar. The addition of 'real' facial expressions may seem a bit gimmicky but is essential when questioning suspects. It is up to the game player to determine whether suspects are telling the truth or lying, and this can be done by carefully watching facial expressions. However, if you accuse a suspect of lying you will need to have some kind of proof to back it up. Graphically, the developers has done an amazing job - there does not seem to be a noticable repetition of buildings within the map. Vehicles are rendered beautifully and appear to be fairly faithful to the real things. It is a shame that the game is limited to 30fps on the PC but it is a solid 30fps (played with Fraps running to check). The XBox 360 version has moments where the FPS drops well below 30. Sound is used very well, using a dramatic score when something important is happening in the game. Music is also used during the searching of clues and helps the game player stay within the 'search area'. NPCs have dialogue but it can be quite repetitive. Sound effects are spot on, even down to the sound of aircraft flying high up overhead and chirping birds, etc.L.A. Noire will appeal to gamers who like to think and solves clues. It may appear to be similar to the GTA series but the missions are in no way similar. If you are an arcade game fan this game will not appeal as it is very difficult to pick it up for a quick blast.			",43,2,8,5,1,0,1

												Play as a detective in post war L.A. and solve multiple cases. The characters' facial animations have been done in a totally new way and it looks superb. Their expressions change realistically according to what they are saying and in what context or mood they are in. Surely all the software developers are going to have to use this technique with their characters from now on? Just having lip syncing without facial expressions won't cut it anymore after this.The game itself is original and compelling. I can't think of another game anything like it. I can't believe that it appears that there is no sequel in the works either! It will be a great shame if there's no follow up.Brilliant and totally original.			",78,26,19,19,16,3,63

												L.A. Noire is a game released in 2011 by Rockstar Games and Team Bondi. You play as Cole Phelps, who just entered the police department of Los Angeles. You'll play as him, you'll have to solve all sorts of cases. Nearly all the characters of the game are really charismatic, and you'll love some of them and hate others. The story is really attractive and you'll not stop playing this game till you have finish it. When i play it for the first time i was like ""Well it just looks like a Movie-Game"" then i finished it and i said ""Wow, i need to get all achievements for this game !"" So i did this, after 40 hours i got them all. If you play the game without trying to get all achievements I guess 10/15hours is enough to finish it, it's already a nice lifetime for a game like that. Once again, Rockstar prove that they can do something else that GTA and that the render is awesome. If you want to get all cases with 5 stars without any guide/walkthrough, i can tell you that you'll have some difficulties.. The game have such a growing difficulty, i mean at the begginning it's quite easy, items you need to find are easy to find, people that you investigate doesn't hide that much their expressions, but when you're at the middle of the game it's getting harder and then at the end, harder again :)As i said before, the story is really branching i mean, i was re-acting as the ingame characters, and the cases are interesting. If i had to rate this game it would be: -Graphics 19/20-Gameplay 18/20-Audio 20/20 (depends of you but, i loved it)-Accessibility 18/20GLOBAL RATE: 18.75/20 Hope you enjoy that review, leave a like if you did :P			",102,7,0,1,3,0,3

												A game in the style of old detective comics.  It's more of a cerebral game than an action packed one (though there is some action).  The game does kind of drag on at parts, and as such, I highly recommend skipping all the random street crimes, and just having your partner drive you everywhere (by holding down the enter vehicle button until you tell your partner to drive).  The street crimes don't add much to the game unless you're a staunch completionist.  The game is broken up into distinct chapters, and so it is easy to sit down and play it in hour long chunks, which might be nice for some people.You can probably get 30ish hours out of this game, but as I said, the game does definitely drag on at points.  I'd recommend it if you see it on sale, but maybe not for full price.  It's a fun game overall, but suffers from the pacing.			",247,46,0,41,20,2,35

												You're one of the LA's finest, a former military veteran who is looking to build a successful career out of law enforcement in 1940's post World War II L.A. with fancy suits and muscle cars. It's men's world.Playing L.A. Noire is like taking part in an interactive movie. It's more than just watching the action as you get to take part in it. And the outcome of the cases is determined on your gut, your attention to detail, and interrogation skills rather than just wating the actor to state their line. If there is at least a tiny bit of detective in you and you want to get to the bottom of things then you'll find the storyline captivating and it will drag you in like honey.As of gameplay, mouse & keyboard combo is tolerable. Walking and running around with keys and using mouse to look/aim works fine most of the time. Driving is slightly awkward when you want to drive straight or especially when trying to take sharp corners in high speed due to the fact that the camera turns slowly behind the vehicle unless your mouse hand is in sync with your keyboard hand. Many times I've ended up smashing bumpers with oncoming traffic or rear fender taking contact with nearby mailbox or lamp post. However, as this is not the most important mechanic I bare with it. Car chases are still fun.Interrogation of people is the one that gives you the most ""what ifs"". Do I believe what this person is saying with their eyes rolling out of their heads or do I push my luck to squeeze the last bit of information they have? Or do I dare to state they're lying and then provide them with evidence that I know what the real case is? And you'd better have the evidence with such allegation or the conversation may be short lived.The gameplay involves occasional chases both on foot and on wheels, some gunfights and brawls. They play out decently not getting too much attention from the story itself. In overall, there's a nice balance of action, seeking and dialogue to my taste and it keeps me tempted to replay a case after a case until I get the gist of how it should have been.If you have no patience and you couldn't care less about the story then this might not be the game for you. But if you're into the era and the mysteries of police detectives then I highly recommend L.A. Noire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice attempt at a detective game, and while the execution is certainly interessting the gameplay has massive logical/coherrence flaws that make it awfully dull down to the point where you can either get 30% wrong or simply use a guide to get everything right.Things that would serve as sufficient indication of the involvement into a crime magically do not matter when not presented along with the right question, and dare you attempt to nail your suspect on a piece of evidence that is just as damning as the one the game wants you to pick then all your evidence can go right to hell - you wont get a confession.It's certainly an impressive production but theres a ton of polishing left to do on it. Nontheless well made, you wont be playing it over and over again but the one time you will, you will enjoy it.			",41,2,0,16,5,0,10

												L.A Noire plays out in the mid-20th century, just after the Second World War. You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a good hearted cop who was a soldier in the pacific during the second world war. The game confronts you with a time period where racism was rampant, drug abuse was growing, and violence was all too common. The city of L.A is one of the major stars in the game. Every street is full of life, with people going in and out of bars and shops, people reading the daily newspaper before going to work. The game feels as though its actually come to life. MotionScan, a neat piece of technology which Team Bondi created to capture the emotions of the characters on screen. It works splendidly, giving each conversation an engrossing hook that typically associated with great film and television dramas. When a character lies, you can see it in their face. Interviewing a suspect is the hardest and most important thing you will do in the game. You ask a question, listen to their response and then attempt to decipher whether it's a lie, the truth or something you should ""doubt"" and inquire further about. You don't only listen to what they saying, but you have to look very carefully at their faces as well. The slightest twitch in there cheek, or there eyes darting quickly to the left can help you uncover the truth. There is more to L.A Noire than just interrogation. There is a fair amount of crime-scene investigation, patrolling and beat work. At crime scenes, you are able to examine the victim up close to try find clues. You will walk around crime scene picking up all sorts of objects to see if they hold any clues. Outside of the regular story. L.A. Noire offers a few other tasks. You can explore the city and look for historic L.A. landmarks, tackle random side mission crimes as they come to you over your C.B. radio, as well as play additional DLC cases. Once you have finished a story, you are ranked to how well you answered questions, how many you got right, and how much damage you did to your car and the the city of L.A. The sounds in the game are amazing, with cars and busses going by, to the sound of the sparks coming from the electric wires as the tram drives past you. The acting is completely believable and really helps set this game apart from other detective games. The Verdict:For all of its attention to detail, L.A. Noire hits the occasional false note. But if you put that aside, L.A Noire can be a very entertaining game, with an open world to explore and lots of interesting cases, The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair. L.A Noire is a perfect game that I would definitely recommend to everyone. Pros:+ Open world of an authentic and outstanding 1940s style of atmosphere+ Memorable story+ Great use of motion capture+ Compelling investigation and interrogation mechanics + Amazing graphics+ Brilliant acting + Amazing soundCons:- Some restrictions during pursuits and shoot-outs feel artificial- Can become a bit repetitive at timesScore: 9/10			",80,29,0,14,10,0,0

												Still one of the best storyline games ever to come out in the last two decades.Yeah, some small flaws with graphics(If you'd ever notice them), but the storyline as a detective who starts from down below.The game goes to the years after WW2, Cole Phelps is your guy!You'll have to question people, whether to doubt them, or prove they like. Otherwise, they must be speaking true. Many cases to solve and think a little bit like a detective. Another problem, sometimes solving problems are a little bit too easy...			",41,9,0,5,7,1,9

												As a cinematic experience, LA Noire is very good. It has a stack of content, compelling stories, great voice acting and revolutionary facial animation. It tackles challenging themes in a mature manner. It offers a large area to explore, built with great attention to detail.As a game...it's a mixed bag. The distractions - driving, shooting, tailing and collecting items - are nothing special. The core is the investigation - searching for clues and interrogating witnesses/suspects. The former is decent, with helpful difficulty options. The latter has its moments, both good and keyboard-smashingly bad.Two examples. A witness is asked about a document found in the possession of somebody else. There is no reason to be sure, or even reasonably suspect, that she is aware of it. When she denies knowledge of it, an appropriate choice response would seem to be ""Doubt"". According to the game, it's ""Lie"" - even though her response seems to confirm that she was unaware of it, making the ""Lie"" a strange choice. Even worse, there is another situation where you are expected to select ""Lie"", when the actual lie arises from the response to your challenge upon choosing ""Lie""!The single checkpoint save is also frustrating. Realise you made a mistake (seeing witness in a certain order cuts out a possible question in an early mission, for instance) or encounter a mission-breaking bug after a checkpoint save, and you have to go back to the very beginning - 30+ mins of unskippable dialogue and driving.There's also port issues - a woeful 30fps, graphical pop-in and the like.For all that...it's still a compelling experience. As much as it annoys me, I keep coming back. It may require a new keyboard by the end, but it'll be worth it.			",417,156,10,77,70,11,98

												Play as Detective Phelps the meanest mofo since that Fabio guy from Assassins Creed. This guys elbows put lightsabers to shame. Talk to people and suss out whether or not they are full of it. Most of the time if they look like they're lying, they're telling the truth. What's up with that? Also one of the first missions is all like some dudes robbing a bank you kill these guys with no repercussions, nothing at all. This guy is not only above the law he is the law. Is he Judge Dredd? Maybe. The driviing in this game is hectically bad, maybe Phelps is actually a massive alcoholic but it only effects his driving? Anyway Phelps ends up stabbing one to many people with his elbows and♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down I dont understand why, he cant help his elbosexual urges. This game seems pretty good.

												To start with, I can honestly say I've never had a love for a video game like I've had for L.A. Noire. The graphics are not the greatest ever seen, detail in objects lacks; how ever during interrogations, facial expressions are very well drawn. I don't full-on action games, I like ones that have a strong story line to aid it; L.A. Noire's story is the best graphical story I've come across so far. The characters are very well described throughout the story and scenes in the game make you think. There is no shortage of surprises and suspense is not scarce. If you're one to enjoy a mysterious but thrilling action game (with some very nice jazz in the background), then L.A. Noire is without competition.			",12,10,0,5,0,0,0

												I like this game mostly because the new things they tried to do, were done right. BUT, there are other things that should have been done better, basically because somebody else has already done them right.+ Acting, both faces and voices, are excellent and interviews are quite fun.+ The cases are interesting, altough sometimes a bit predictable and linear. Sometimes you say things you souldn t have known (because you missed that clue before or changed the order in wich you do something) and thats quite odd, I d really like there where different ways to solve a case or even fail it. There is some of that, but it doesn t really work that way (DLCs do it a bit better )- But what I like the least about this game is combat. I realise it is very story driven and you can skip action parts if you fail them a few times, but that s not an excuse for faulty controls. Usually they are not a mess, but just sloppy enough to get into my nerves from time to time. Like when you just stand there eating bullets instead of getting into cover, or running into walls while chasing a suspect.- I d like it existed the chance to go for peaceful solutions to some cases (street crimes for instance), like trying to talk a barricated suspect into surrendering instead of just shoting them.

												First of all, it's a unique experience with a captivating story, based on real cases. The interrogation mechanics and finding clues feel entertaining. Facial expressions are unbelievable - behind each character there is an actual person (appearance and voice). In some cases you might even recognize them, especially if you know the TV series Mad Men.On the other hand, roaming around the city is boring. Even though the noire atmosphere is good enough, there is almost nothing to do apart from the main story. Thankfully it's possible to let your partner do the driving most of the time.

												L.A. Noire is a very gritty game. It tells the story about a detective named Cole. The crimes you have to deal with in this game are insane. I won't tell you anything about them, because I don't want to spoil it. It seriously is a great game to have if you are in to murder mystery games. Also, this game was published by Rockstar, not made by them. A lot of people give no credit to Team Bondi and give it all to Rockstar. The only thing I have wrong with this game, is the wonky driving physics. It's pretty poor. Otherwise this is a rock solid game.			",83,7,2,12,8,0,2

												Very compelling and deep story line with a great ending that ties all the complexities together in a way that isn't unnessesarily spectacular and explosion-y. Took me about 25 hours to complete going at a moderate pace so there's a fair bit to do with plenty of replayability to unlock all the cars and see all the secret items that help the story along.Overall a very good game. However the PC port of it leaves much to be desired with crashing issues occasionally as well as a 30fps cap. Also, the game (in my opinion) is best played with an xbox controller , probably due to console being its intended platform.			",57,7,2,12,10,0,9

												L.A. Noire is one of those games that can really surprise you with how good it is. While it has some open world aspects to it, the game is actually quite linear as far as mission structure and story are concerned. This is not a bad thing. It's like watching an old mystery movie, combined with point-and-click game concepts, and GTA mechanics and gameplay. It all fuses together to form a unique game that is very interesting to play through.The visuals are quite good, and even today could be mistaken for next-gen quality. The faces are very expressive, much more so than most games in general. This is because part of the game is about reading your subject when interrogating them to see if they are lying or not.While the different elements of this game are derivative from many games you've probably played before, the experience and setting make this a game feel unique. It is certainly worth the playthrough for just about any gamer.7/10 ""Good""			",97,38,1,24,4,3,12

												You're one of the LA's finest, a former military veteran who is looking to build a successful career out of law enforcement in 1940's post World War II L.A. with fancy suits and muscle cars. It's men's world.Playing L.A. Noire is like taking part in an interactive movie. It's more than just watching the action as you get to take part in it. And the outcome of the cases is determined on your gut, your attention to detail, and interrogation skills rather than just wating the actor to state their line. If there is at least a tiny bit of detective in you and you want to get to the bottom of things then you'll find the storyline captivating and it will drag you in like honey.As of gameplay, mouse & keyboard combo is tolerable. Walking and running around with keys and using mouse to look/aim works fine most of the time. Driving is slightly awkward when you want to drive straight or especially when trying to take sharp corners in high speed due to the fact that the camera turns slowly behind the vehicle unless your mouse hand is in sync with your keyboard hand. Many times I've ended up smashing bumpers with oncoming traffic or rear fender taking contact with nearby mailbox or lamp post. However, as this is not the most important mechanic I bare with it. Car chases are still fun.Interrogation of people is the one that gives you the most ""what ifs"". Do I believe what this person is saying with their eyes rolling out of their heads or do I push my luck to squeeze the last bit of information they have? Or do I dare to state they're lying and then provide them with evidence that I know what the real case is? And you'd better have the evidence with such allegation or the conversation may be short lived.The gameplay involves occasional chases both on foot and on wheels, some gunfights and brawls. They play out decently not getting too much attention from the story itself. In overall, there's a nice balance of action, seeking and dialogue to my taste and it keeps me tempted to replay a case after a case until I get the gist of how it should have been.If you have no patience and you couldn't care less about the story then this might not be the game for you. But if you're into the era and the mysteries of police detectives then I highly recommend L.A. Noire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is so amazing about a 2011 game and a love letter to old noire movies like ""The Untouchables"" and ""The Black Dahlia"" from rockstar and team bondi that puts you into the shoes of a rookie detective Cole Phelps? Everything. L.A. Noire is all about amazing you with its crisp gameplay, groundbreaking facial capture technology (at the time), and great atmosphere and setting.Set in 1946 Los Angeles, the second world war has come to a close and living soldiers have to make a living somehow. Cole Phelps decides to go into law enforcement, and the story ramps up from there, no spoilers at all from me, you just have to trust me. I bought this game on my xbox360, ps3, and now my tablet, (surface 3), and the game still manages to feel new to me. The controls on PC are great, I love the default control, but you can easily adjust and edit those controls in the options. You can use any game controller as well. One thing for tablets though, using the right click if you have no mouse gets troublesome pretty fast, but for desktop users it is fluid, no doubt.The graphics are beautiful, but the game is capped at 30FPS (I believe) and that might bug people, but you can always tinker with the graphics in  game anytime. ANYTIME. No more launcher people!Facial capture technology is what really shines here though, as it displays the emotions and ""tells"", (which you need for interrogations and questioning people at the crime scene). perfectly. The gameplay is fun if you like puzzle games, third person games, story rich games, or even just noire like games. The feeling and atmosphere as stated above is just incredible. Just incredible! It has.... Puzzle solving and deducing. Gunplay. Car chases and on foot chases. Hand to Hand combat. Tough decision making. Drivingand more.The length of this game is also fantastic, though near the end, I began to lose track of the story as I didn't like something that happens. I won't spoil it completely, but you'll know what I mean. Why was that necessary? Stick with the ideas you had. Not to mention, I didn't entirely get the ending, it is a bit underwhelming, and very unexpected.All in all though, this game is definitely worth a buy, even more if you can pick it up on sale. Here's to hoping for L.A. Noire 2 folks :)Get Cole Phelp'd			",28,19,0,7,3,2,4

												Another Rockstar so immersion is outstanding, again play with headphones.  The feel of, I'm guessing, 1950s LA is tremendous and is really remeniscent of LA Confidential, so I instantly loved this.The voice acting is really well done indeed and I'm guessing the actors bodies were imaged for each character in this, so it's a big bravo on that.  The story is very impressive and it was excellent to see the main plot ticking over in the background whilst you're following a meandering path, which will eventually lead you to said plot.  The graphics and sound effects were excellent and joined with the innovative element of interrogation you have a winning formula that deserves to be a big fan favourite.  Also hats off to attention to detail with the vehicles.  They had no crumple zones and such in those days, as they were just girders on wheels and if you hit something you really hit it with a crunch.If you don't have this then get it.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't expect to enjoy the game nearly as much as I did.L.A. Noire is, more or less, a twenty hour, interactive version of L.A. Confidential. The writing is solid, the MOCAP is great, the cases are enjoyable, and your partners are each unique and enjoyable for different reasons.The only real weaknesses with the game are the inability to skip cutscenes (when you're repeating things), the cheaty enemy driving AI, and the very vague Truth / Doubt / Lie system. For maximum enjoyment, I'd recommend using the L.A. Noire wiki to use the right interview responses but not for anything else.They also really nail the feeling of 1940s LA - both visually and musically. The soundtrack has this great, escalating grandure that exemplified the postwar period and the different music subsets (ex: chase, combat, investigate) are unique and enjoyable.Shooting is trivially easy with a mouse, but the game is more a narrative piece than anything else. After my third shootout, I felt like the Dredd of 1940s LA.If you like art deco, the postwar period, a smart story, good dialog, and a unique gaming experience, buy L.A. Noire.It's such a shame the studio management at Team Bondi were such scumbags and are the reason we'll never get a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you value story, you owe it to yourself to play this game. The gunplay, driving and moving around are pretty much lifted from GTA4, which doesn't say much for it even if it's improved since then. But the investigations, interrogations and storyline are about as good as you're going to see in video games. Adventure game fans and fans of the Ace Attorney series will find lots to love. The replay value is more or less nil unless you somehow forget the story, but Noire is worth a good 30 hours for once through and it's worth that.			",257,179,2,23,25,4,47

												This game is great, great story, action sequences are fun, and the character is realistic. Graphics could be better for their time, but it's not horrible. The real kicker is the 30 FPS lock. You have to use a 3rd party program to unlock, and even that doesn't work for many people. If you don't care about the FPS lock, you should buy this game.

												L.A Noire plays out in the mid-20th century, just after the Second World War. You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a good hearted cop who was a soldier in the pacific during the second world war. The game confronts you with a time period where racism was rampant, drug abuse was growing, and violence was all too common. The city of L.A is one of the major stars in the game. Every street is full of life, with people going in and out of bars and shops, people reading the daily newspaper before going to work. The game feels as though its actually come to life. MotionScan, a neat piece of technology which Team Bondi created to capture the emotions of the characters on screen. It works splendidly, giving each conversation an engrossing hook that typically associated with great film and television dramas. When a character lies, you can see it in their face. Interviewing a suspect is the hardest and most important thing you will do in the game. You ask a question, listen to their response and then attempt to decipher whether it's a lie, the truth or something you should ""doubt"" and inquire further about. You don't only listen to what they saying, but you have to look very carefully at their faces as well. The slightest twitch in there cheek, or there eyes darting quickly to the left can help you uncover the truth. There is more to L.A Noire than just interrogation. There is a fair amount of crime-scene investigation, patrolling and beat work. At crime scenes, you are able to examine the victim up close to try find clues. You will walk around crime scene picking up all sorts of objects to see if they hold any clues. Outside of the regular story. L.A. Noire offers a few other tasks. You can explore the city and look for historic L.A. landmarks, tackle random side mission crimes as they come to you over your C.B. radio, as well as play additional DLC cases. Once you have finished a story, you are ranked to how well you answered questions, how many you got right, and how much damage you did to your car and the the city of L.A. The sounds in the game are amazing, with cars and busses going by, to the sound of the sparks coming from the electric wires as the tram drives past you. The acting is completely believable and really helps set this game apart from other detective games. The Verdict:For all of its attention to detail, L.A. Noire hits the occasional false note. But if you put that aside, L.A Noire can be a very entertaining game, with an open world to explore and lots of interesting cases, The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair. L.A Noire is a perfect game that I would definitely recommend to everyone. Pros:+ Open world of an authentic and outstanding 1940s style of atmosphere+ Memorable story+ Great use of motion capture+ Compelling investigation and interrogation mechanics + Amazing graphics+ Brilliant acting + Amazing soundCons:- Some restrictions during pursuits and shoot-outs feel artificial- Can become a bit repetitive at timesScore: 9/10			",80,29,0,14,10,0,0

												The answer to the question ""what would happen if Rockstar actually tried to make a game with some type of structure, rather than just wheeling bags of cash to the bank thanks to a long-running sandbox franchise?"" LA Noire is damn good. The storyline's a blast, the writing is good, and, despite some hilarious hiccups, the detective mechanics stand out as something that few games are daring to try. The overall package is a good game, and it feels all the more better for how much the developers went out on a limb.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, this is exactually as I expected.  Even though I have not really been interested in the noir genre, I can say this is a real treat. This game really takes overall gaming to the next level; with use of a high tech camera system filming real actors and actresses, you choose if a victim/murderer is lying or telling the truth based off of their facial and vocal expressions. My major problem is that with a simple laptop, I didn't really get the best performance with this game, even on the lowest settings.To rap this up, this game is a must buy for gamers into the mystery/noir genre, and if it's for 4.99; all the better to pick up and play this game.

												Thrilling, yet under control. Dark, yet intensely intruiging. L.A. Noire is an exciting experience, for all gamers!The game is really engaging and interesting because the storyline is rich and well thought out. Ironically, this is L.A. Noire's shortfall as well. The game mechanics seemed pretty cool, but cases after cases, you realize that the mechanics are not very indepth. This makes the game feel repetitive and tedious after a little while.But if you find yourself immersed in the storyline, these little things won't bother you at all. ",47,5,0,8,1,0,0

												L.A. Noire is a fantastic game.  It's not like Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption. You don't rely on killing your enemy. Instead, you have to rely on intuition and good detective work. Its story, presentation and gameplay are all solid with the new facial technology probably being the best part of the game. With 87 hours under my belt and a 100% completion rate, I feel good giving this game two thumbs up.			",123,45,1,14,6,2,14

												Great game, i really recommend it.First of all I have to say that this is the first game i´ve ever played that I really felt like being in a movie, that's a cliché in other games but in this one isn't it, concretely in a film noir, the environment and the style do their best to put in the role, never said better.Special attention to motion capture in faces that shows the care that had the Housers brothers to catch the spirit of cinema in a game with characters a well characterized.But... all that glitters is not gold, the game have some negative aspects for example the imprecise system to cover and movements.But for me the main lack is in the script, basically i think that is better that the Houser bros has dedicated to videogames because the story never had a engaging script, with a not very good ending.Even that things I think that is ""you must play"" for all the people who love noir cinema, or just wanna have a different experience in gaming.

												First off let me begin with saying how amazing the storyline in this game is. You start off as a LAPD officer named Cole Phelps a former 1st Lt. in the U.S. Army that fought in WWII. All the cases are believable and could all happen in real life. When you interrogate people it feels so real. Even though you can tell when someone is lying you have to show proof how you know they're lying through the clues you have found throughout the case. The gameplay mechanics are also beautiful and the game runs smooth, except for a couple of glitches. Ex: A lady waitress glitched inside of me while I was sitting down and her♥♥♥♥♥was in my face while I was interrogating someone at a club. This definitely gets on the top of my list for best RPG games. Plot 9.5/10Mechanics 9/10In total I'd rate this game a 9/10			",106,11,1,16,13,1,20

												A great experiment with mixed results, the use of face capture technology is very impressive but probably won't age well. Tying the unique tech to an interrogation mechanic is a great idea, though sometimes the interrogations themselves can be frustrating and illogical, even to the point that I'd just restart the mission if it became a wash. Shooting and driving are both passable and functional, except for a frustrating sequence in the finale which involves way more shooting than the rest of the game. What I love most about this game is its adherence to Noir style, complete with all the backstabbing intrigue that comes with it. Nearly every Noir trope is in full effect here, and there's some truly excellent acting to be found, on par with Hollywood productions, probably because there are a great deal of talented character actors involved that you'll probably recognize from this thing or that. The story is solid and kept me hooked, and its final scene is brilliantly delivered. As with others I've enjoyed, this is a game I recommend not for the strength of its mechanics, but for its ""feel"", and in terms of making you feel like a hard-boiled Noir detective, you won't find anything better on the market.

												LA Noire makes a bit of a compromise between genres to appeal more players, in this case a mix between a free roaming and a Noire novel adventure. I believe that if the whole town was to be depicted in a smaller way, there could have been a far better and deeper rendition of some beautiful places you happen to walk through (and that could have left more resources for other ""details"" as a better plot for some cases and more gameplay depth). As it is, the game is a good adventure that lacks quite a bit of everything to really sparkle. The plot as a whole is interesting, the last chapters and the end are rather...sad and bitter. I think the Metacritic score is quite appropriate, i wouldn't give more than 7,5-7,8 to L.A. Noire.P.s. being a console port, it will perform average at best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I joined the site when Steam made me an offer I can't refuse which is this game. Borrowed and played it on my Playstation 3 for a while and got bored but something about the ""Noire"" aspect and the era the game is set in drew me back to this title which is why I decided to buy it, this time on PC.After playing just a bit farther than I had in the past, I have to admit that I missed out. I get the hype and I get why people love this game. It has so much more depth as the story progresses. It is beautifully written and most of the actors involved are brilliant (kudos to the casting director!). The story keeps you hooked and if I  was a decade younger I'd be playing this game nonstop from start to finish in one seating.The graphic quality is not on par with its PS3 counterpart, it's better. It's a given that you need a decent GPU to run it and fortunately I got a pretty good one installed on my laptop. Control leaves something to be desired since the mouse can't never replace a Dual Shock controller once a game is optimized for said controller which this game certainly is. But it's still more than playable, just needs some getting used to when inspecting a crime scene. In many ways this game is just as good as the PS3 one just with more customizing options. Get yourself a nice controller and you might be able to enjoy this game more. It's such a shame that the game developer (Bondi) is shut down, we need more games with the same innovation they brought to this one. I mean, performance capture for games? It's absolutely brilliant! Hope other devs would look into the same technology and use it to make story-driven games like this one here.If you have never played the game or don't have a copy of it on Steam or what have you, get this game. It's a classic (literally)!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I got this game when it was on sale and got straight in it. The story is great, the voice acting is one of the best I've ever heard and not to mention facial animations. It brings you back to those old point and click detective games but in a big open space 3d world.			",69,7,0,13,4,0,2

The optimisation shouldn't put the game down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like playing a movie, in the best way imaginable.I've seen previews of it, and I was intrigued. I heard more about it and I really got interested. I saw someone demo it and I was immediately sold. This game is not for everyone, however. It has gritty visuals and intense subject matter. If you like the Black Dahlia film or Noir detective stories, you may like this. The sound direction is superb, and the music is very well done. Some tracks can wear on the nerves, but the action tracks put you in the moment.This game plays very well on Windows 7, but crashes do happen on occasion.Overall, this is a very excellent title, and the actors are superb, for the most part. If you watch Mad Men, you may see more familiar faces than just Phelps. This is a huge leap for in-game visuals, as the talking heads do look very good most of the time. Some glitches can be jarring, but they're few.It's a large game, and requres a lot of RAM and a very capable video card. Nevertheless, it's well worth the visit to 1940's Los Angeles if you want a good detective procedural.			",196,38,3,31,29,3,49

												Worth reviewing for a lump of coal or a badge. However...Highly engrossing. Some say it's repetitious, probably due to each case essentially having you starting from scratch. I don't see how it's any different to highly popular crime shows. Watch a whole DVD of that in one sitting and I'm sure you'll see repetition too.It was a very ambitious choice to mix a number of elements. Undoubtedly compromises had to be made to make them fit which I think were minimal. I also applaud their foresight to employ new technology and use it to create a critical element of the game (face capture).Finally the atmosphere is just great. So much polish, so much attention to detail. It feels a shame this whole world was built and may never be used again.			",85,32,10,11,18,3,37

												This game cured my porn addiction during the Homicide cases! 10/10 No doubt!However, there are in-fact downsides... Even if you do have a computer capable playing Grand Theft Auto IV, you may still suffer very bad gameplay experience because of its limited 30 frames per second refresh rate and some other technical bits about the bad performance of the game...Since this game is not using Rockstar's Advanced Game Engine but a modified unnamed engine, I guess you may find that some driving aspects and shooting mechanics are slight different in the works from GTA IV...Workarounds are of course limited and not throughly proven to fix all solutions surrounding the game, example:-str or Single Threading game setting-nonv to disable nVidia 3D stereoscopic view (if you are using AMD or Intel GPU)-npd works by extending the compatibilty of GPUs which are not in their native supported DirectX version. If you have a DirectX 10 GPU but there's no DX10 option, you better choose DirectX 9 renderer and add -npd to the command lineBut if you managed to iron out (or even ignored) these NG stuffs, you will really get to experience the game at it's best!Played on an Intel Pentium Dual Core processor PC with 2GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics with some drawbacks.

												Wow, this is exactually as I expected.  Even though I have not really been interested in the noir genre, I can say this is a real treat. This game really takes overall gaming to the next level; with use of a high tech camera system filming real actors and actresses, you choose if a victim/murderer is lying or telling the truth based off of their facial and vocal expressions. My major problem is that with a simple laptop, I didn't really get the best performance with this game, even on the lowest settings.To rap this up, this game is a must buy for gamers into the mystery/noir genre, and if it's for 4.99; all the better to pick up and play this game.

												Really incredible. The game play itself isn't anything spectacular, but the world that Rockstar has created in 1947 Los Angeles is really something to experience. I have spent hours just driving around, sightseeing, listening to the radio, finding various secrets. My dad lived in L.A. In the mid 50s, so I got to share a bit of his youthful memories through the game. He even recognized the song playing on the radio!An interesting side note: Rockstar used over 180,000 aerial photographs in order to more accurately reproduce that noire feeling of 1940s Los Angeles. Actual radio broadcasts, commercials, and music (The Bickersons, The Jack Benny Program, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald) were also used to further immerse the player.A fun game, but if you're at all into 40s Americana it's worth buying just to cruise down Holywood Blvd in one of the 95 vintage cars listening to Bing Crosby.I certainly enjoyed it!

												My overall impression of the game is - it should have been done differently. Even though I enjoyed its setting and atmosphere, I can't help but think that there are so many things that could have been improved - such as the storytelling (after 35 hours of gameplay I still can't say that I fully understand the main character's motivations) or graphics (beautifully done faces plastered on fake looking bodies didn't exactly work for me). The city is unnecessarily big and, sadly, feels quite empty. Perhaps the game would have been better off without the forced sandbox feel. However, I enjoyed the majority of the cases and would deffinitely want something similar to be developed in the future - just without the aforementioned faults. I'd rate L.A. Noire 7 out of 10 - even with all its small issues, the game managed to hook me for the whole 35 hours. I don't think I will come back to it though; it's just a one-time experience.

												This game is underrated, but it is suprisingly an amazing game. In L.A. Noire you're playing as a cop that goes by the name of Cole Phelps. The game takes placein 1940's Los Angeles and I think the game developers did an amazing job creating this game. During thetime you play the game you really get that feeling that the city is supposed to be 1940's L.A., when almost everyone wore a suit and a hat! They actually did a good job with the music as well, because you can only hear old music, and not dubstep or house music.Also, the facial expressions in this game is amazing. Too bad they haven't used this technique in other games.The PC-port for this game has been criticized, and I agree that the PC-port could be alot better. However, the game itself is amazing, the PC-port doesn't ruin the experience of playing the game, in my opinion.			",156,34,2,14,6,2,8

												Well, the game is broken. Most people can't seem to launch it since a recent patch, hence the many negative reviews. However, one community member, namely Nightbreed, found a solution to make the game work fairly easily. And it is reported by many members to work.You can find his solution here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/110800/discussions/0/366298942102103678/So, once we're through with launching the game (even though Rockstar tried hard to make it impossible), we have a nice game after all. There is noire, there are realistic facial expressions (which we have to learn how to read if we want to crack all the cases), and the story itself creates a nice atmosphere. Maybe one of the greatest trait of this game is that it's one of a kind. Trust me, there might be other detective games, but none other recreates the unique game experience that L.A. Noire provides. It's not action pumped, although it does have shootings once in a while, but instead it entrails us with well written dialogues, interesting, and often mind-boggling cases, a knack of humour, all presented to us in a 50's style, with a hint of noire in it.One of the greatest cons I could highlight from this game is a technical one: As it seems, the game is limited at 30fps, so those who have a keen eye for 60fps and beyond, might need some time to get used to it.Other than that, if we get past that tiny little thing, that the game doesn't start in it's original form, I could hardly come up with cons. And why would I?Fix the game, then play the hell out of it. Case closed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice attempt at a detective game, and while the execution is certainly interessting the gameplay has massive logical/coherrence flaws that make it awfully dull down to the point where you can either get 30% wrong or simply use a guide to get everything right.Things that would serve as sufficient indication of the involvement into a crime magically do not matter when not presented along with the right question, and dare you attempt to nail your suspect on a piece of evidence that is just as damning as the one the game wants you to pick then all your evidence can go right to hell - you wont get a confession.It's certainly an impressive production but theres a ton of polishing left to do on it. Nontheless well made, you wont be playing it over and over again but the one time you will, you will enjoy it.			",41,2,0,16,5,0,10

												I got this game expecting a noir-themed detective game, with a intuitive investigating and interrogation mechanic. It was those things, sure, but it was also a cover-based shooter.Ugh. The cover-based shooting is sort of alright. There are worse, but when you go from thoughtful investigation to YET ANOTHER BLOODY CHASE SCENE is really jarring the first few times.I would recommend this game if you want to learn how to manipulate others and have a passing interest in body language and psychology; it's here, and here in tons. If you can wade past the seemingly mandatory sludge of cover-based shooting.Used a fruit machine and a box of drugs appeared/10			",172,15,4,9,16,2,17

												Overall: 6/10Pros:- The graphics are top notch. This game is a visual pleasure.- The storyline is quite interesting.- Acting and voice overs are unparalleled.Cons:- The interface is clunky, probably the result of a poor conversion from console.- You don't get to do much and what you get to do is somehow repetitive (click here, find clue, choose questions to interrogate suspects, action sequence, end of story)Overall it's a nice to have game just for the visuals, the sounds and to show off how ""cool"" a computer game could be, but it definitely lacks depth, has zero replayability and does not offer much.

It's only one of the games that I've played for 7 hours in one sitting. Extremely good. The only problem I have is deciding if the person is 1. telling the truth 2. not telling the whole truth, or 3. flat out lying.

												L.A. Noire is a lot like an adventure game, but it's very original and doesn't spare any novelty for that. I found it very enjoyable, a game full of mystery, with a well written story and interesting characters. Action is well done likewise, but it isn't the main focus of the game, instead it's the process of solving a case, finding the truth even though the harder you go, the harder it is. The whole facial animations are great, in fact there are no animations - the facial expressions are taken from real people. Unfortunately it can fall in the Uncanny Valley at times, but you can't blame it for that since, it's trying to succeed. If there would be no initiative - there would be no success. This is a favourite of mine.

												Fantastic game. It really has this feel of 40s to it, which I enjoyed very much. The main characters and the story are really interesting, well written and, with the outstanding facial animations, you can really attach to them. There's a good variety of cases to solve, some of them based on real crimes from the 40s, apparently. As far as detective games go, this one is god damn the best one I've ever played. Interrogating is cool, but unfortunately isn't always very intuitive. But I still loved the game and the L.A. in late 40s.			",42,17,1,13,2,0,4

												Although this may not be the best of ports, I can't help but highly recommend this game! Whether you're into gameplay or the storytelling or even both you'll find something to love about this game. A story with many twist and turns, you can easily see the effort put into the writing. The gameplay is also really good. Couple the story with a huge virtual 1940's Los Angeles to explore for extra missions and hidden collectables. Most of the problems come from the poor PC optimation but if you have a good PC you can (hopefully) bypass those issues.			",723,169,31,81,50,21,55

												[7/10] – L.A. Noire is a very entertaining action detective simulator that has incredible attention to detail and a phenomenal animation system. Yet sadly, its 30fps cap, and dodgy controls at times leave a small void inside me. Even with its flaws, it’s a very fun and mature title, and worth the price of admission. If you like GTA/Mafia II style open world games, but want the intellectualism offered only by more mature titles, then this is for you. It definitely makes you think, and punishes you for poor detective skills, so good problem solving is a must. There are also some pretty awesome action moments with a Hollywood feel to them, and usually don’t disappoint. Overall I thought it was a good ride while it lasted.			",381,70,2,36,24,3,66

												Wow. Quite an incredible game.Pros: -By far the best facial epxressions I've ever seen in a game, which is good because they play a very key part in interrigations.-Once you learn the classic tells of a liar, interrigations become much more fluid, and less rage inducing.-A very immersive and a great portayal of a 40's detective.-Great music & ambience.Cons:-A tad bit long, I have played this game off and on over the years and only just now beat it.-Not a very good port. The game works but unfortunately there are FPS issues, and not just because it is locked to 30 (often drops to 24, but I found that if it happens, just go to graphics settings, change 1 setting, hit apply, and then it's back to 30-repeat as necessary).-Probably best to play this on a console-although if you get this on steam I strongly recommend switching to PC controls for firefights, and using controller for everything else.

												WARNING: Possible spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.Pros:A very well put together narrative, which catalogues the rise and fall of it's characters, in typical Film-noir fashion.Strong, believable characters with excellent delivery both from their respective actors and the awe-inspiring motion-capture technology utilized.Your partners. Their random banter and distinguished personalities are a joy to behold, they act both as the lancer and the foil to Cole's personality, and do an excellent job of playing off of Cole's own musings.Meh's:Lack of penalty for not upholding laws (especially when dealing with traffic), Cole can drive as recklessly as he wants, even right next to other cops without them giving a damn.The structure of the cases, especially between Homicide and Vice. In Homicide, you just finished solving a case that had made a mockery of the LAPD, and in turn, acted as a very rewarding end to that desk. BD would have served as a greater case to end the game with, although given the circumstances, I'm inclined to believe that the narrative was constructed before the individual cases, and that the cases merely served to facilitate Cole's fall from grace.Cons:The save system is check-point based, which is fine, until you realize you have to restart a case and lose an hour's worth of gameplay because the game decides to auto-save after a failed interrogation.Combat, atleast on the PC version, is rather finnicky and temperamental. The gunplay itself works, but the cover system is unresponsive and has baffling key-binds.All in all:If you're willing to deal with slow gameplay coupled with investigatory work and puzzle-solving, this game is right up your alley. It's not a masterpiece, but it will serve as the industry-wide standard for detective games in the future.			",40,7,0,8,5,0,6

												L.A Noire plays out in the mid-20th century, just after the Second World War. You play as Detective Cole Phelps, a good hearted cop who was a soldier in the pacific during the second world war. The game confronts you with a time period where racism was rampant, drug abuse was growing, and violence was all too common. The city of L.A is one of the major stars in the game. Every street is full of life, with people going in and out of bars and shops, people reading the daily newspaper before going to work. The game feels as though its actually come to life. MotionScan, a neat piece of technology which Team Bondi created to capture the emotions of the characters on screen. It works splendidly, giving each conversation an engrossing hook that typically associated with great film and television dramas. When a character lies, you can see it in their face. Interviewing a suspect is the hardest and most important thing you will do in the game. You ask a question, listen to their response and then attempt to decipher whether it's a lie, the truth or something you should ""doubt"" and inquire further about. You don't only listen to what they saying, but you have to look very carefully at their faces as well. The slightest twitch in there cheek, or there eyes darting quickly to the left can help you uncover the truth. There is more to L.A Noire than just interrogation. There is a fair amount of crime-scene investigation, patrolling and beat work. At crime scenes, you are able to examine the victim up close to try find clues. You will walk around crime scene picking up all sorts of objects to see if they hold any clues. Outside of the regular story. L.A. Noire offers a few other tasks. You can explore the city and look for historic L.A. landmarks, tackle random side mission crimes as they come to you over your C.B. radio, as well as play additional DLC cases. Once you have finished a story, you are ranked to how well you answered questions, how many you got right, and how much damage you did to your car and the the city of L.A. The sounds in the game are amazing, with cars and busses going by, to the sound of the sparks coming from the electric wires as the tram drives past you. The acting is completely believable and really helps set this game apart from other detective games. The Verdict:For all of its attention to detail, L.A. Noire hits the occasional false note. But if you put that aside, L.A Noire can be a very entertaining game, with an open world to explore and lots of interesting cases, The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair. L.A Noire is a perfect game that I would definitely recommend to everyone. Pros:+ Open world of an authentic and outstanding 1940s style of atmosphere+ Memorable story+ Great use of motion capture+ Compelling investigation and interrogation mechanics + Amazing graphics+ Brilliant acting + Amazing soundCons:- Some restrictions during pursuits and shoot-outs feel artificial- Can become a bit repetitive at timesScore: 9/10			",80,29,0,14,10,0,0

												As a cinematic experience, LA Noire is very good. It has a stack of content, compelling stories, great voice acting and revolutionary facial animation. It tackles challenging themes in a mature manner. It offers a large area to explore, built with great attention to detail.As a game...it's a mixed bag. The distractions - driving, shooting, tailing and collecting items - are nothing special. The core is the investigation - searching for clues and interrogating witnesses/suspects. The former is decent, with helpful difficulty options. The latter has its moments, both good and keyboard-smashingly bad.Two examples. A witness is asked about a document found in the possession of somebody else. There is no reason to be sure, or even reasonably suspect, that she is aware of it. When she denies knowledge of it, an appropriate choice response would seem to be ""Doubt"". According to the game, it's ""Lie"" - even though her response seems to confirm that she was unaware of it, making the ""Lie"" a strange choice. Even worse, there is another situation where you are expected to select ""Lie"", when the actual lie arises from the response to your challenge upon choosing ""Lie""!The single checkpoint save is also frustrating. Realise you made a mistake (seeing witness in a certain order cuts out a possible question in an early mission, for instance) or encounter a mission-breaking bug after a checkpoint save, and you have to go back to the very beginning - 30+ mins of unskippable dialogue and driving.There's also port issues - a woeful 30fps, graphical pop-in and the like.For all that...it's still a compelling experience. As much as it annoys me, I keep coming back. It may require a new keyboard by the end, but it'll be worth it.			",417,156,10,77,70,11,98

												Still one of the best storyline games ever to come out in the last two decades.Yeah, some small flaws with graphics(If you'd ever notice them), but the storyline as a detective who starts from down below.The game goes to the years after WW2, Cole Phelps is your guy!You'll have to question people, whether to doubt them, or prove they like. Otherwise, they must be speaking true. Many cases to solve and think a little bit like a detective. Another problem, sometimes solving problems are a little bit too easy...			",41,9,0,5,7,1,9

												Play as Detective Phelps the meanest mofo since that Fabio guy from Assassins Creed. This guys elbows put lightsabers to shame. Talk to people and suss out whether or not they are full of it. Most of the time if they look like they're lying, they're telling the truth. What's up with that? Also one of the first missions is all like some dudes robbing a bank you kill these guys with no repercussions, nothing at all. This guy is not only above the law he is the law. Is he Judge Dredd? Maybe. The driviing in this game is hectically bad, maybe Phelps is actually a massive alcoholic but it only effects his driving? Anyway Phelps ends up stabbing one to many people with his elbows and♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down I dont understand why, he cant help his elbosexual urges. This game seems pretty good.

												An investigative TPS that really is one of the most authentic, beautiful, handsomely done games of it's style. That said, nothing I can say will do this game justice. This isn't a game, it's an experience. The story is so driving that you feel great character depth; despite being utterly ♥♥♥♥ing confused in the first few hours of the game with all the seemingly random cinematics. The cases are linear, the action a great spice, and you can throw the case in the cooler and punch some bad guys and steal some wicked cars any time you want.Sweet zombie Jesus whata  credits list.

												Okay so all my life I have been a fan of mystery and noire movies, so much I wanted to play a game taking place in the 1940's but never found quite a good game. Until I ran across l.a noire is so amazing I was not able to play on pc due to my computer not being the best and it would lag to much on important parts of the game however I did love this game so much I bought it for xbox and started the game over and finished it. It's like watching an old movie where you get search for clues and follow leads. The interrogations feel so real and great I love the fact you get to choose who to convict after looking at the evidence with multiple suspects in a case. Great game 10/10 if you love noire movies and mystery BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW			",75,3,3,2,1,0,14

												Respect to Rockstar for originality. Really refreshing gameplay, never played anything like it. Overall pretty much all of the elements are high quality too, nice visuals, great soundtrack, interesting and mature story. The action and driving although far from perfect are decent enough. The investigating, interrogation and story is were the game excels though. Plus I enjoyed the use of the motionscan technology (facial expressions).I did feel it dragged on a bit but remedied by taking a break now and again, one of the main flaws was the most fun part of the game - interrogating suspects and witnesses sometimes failed due to the way the system works and how it is named. Finally it seemed a shame that in such a lovingly crafted and detailed  world there was very little, if any reason to explore away from the main story. A favourite film of mine is Chinatown and LA Noire at points made me feel like I was taking part in my own similar movie. I hope they make a sequel one day and it remains in that era. 9/10 ",122,39,0,15,15,0,10

												Well, the game is broken. Most people can't seem to launch it since a recent patch, hence the many negative reviews. However, one community member, namely Nightbreed, found a solution to make the game work fairly easily. And it is reported by many members to work.You can find his solution here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/110800/discussions/0/366298942102103678/So, once we're through with launching the game (even though Rockstar tried hard to make it impossible), we have a nice game after all. There is noire, there are realistic facial expressions (which we have to learn how to read if we want to crack all the cases), and the story itself creates a nice atmosphere. Maybe one of the greatest trait of this game is that it's one of a kind. Trust me, there might be other detective games, but none other recreates the unique game experience that L.A. Noire provides. It's not action pumped, although it does have shootings once in a while, but instead it entrails us with well written dialogues, interesting, and often mind-boggling cases, a knack of humour, all presented to us in a 50's style, with a hint of noire in it.One of the greatest cons I could highlight from this game is a technical one: As it seems, the game is limited at 30fps, so those who have a keen eye for 60fps and beyond, might need some time to get used to it.Other than that, if we get past that tiny little thing, that the game doesn't start in it's original form, I could hardly come up with cons. And why would I?Fix the game, then play the hell out of it. Case closed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Guide for L.A. Noire

OLDER VERSION OF THE REVIEW HERE***************************************************THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE GAME ITSELF, BUT ITS CURRENT PLAYABILITYAs you might notice from a lot of recent reviews, L.A. Noire is currently unplayable on Windows 10 64bit, and perhaps other operating systems too.I tried all the fixes out there, checked the integrity of .NET framework (both 3.5 and 4), have latest upgrades and drivers installed. Compatibility modes, run game as administrator, run Steam as administrator, reinstall, check game cache, everything. Nothing worked.It just shows the loading screen after the loader and stops working. Windows Event Viewer shows an error saying 0x40000015 unknown application exception. The faulty module is MSVCR90.dll (part of VS2008 runtime, THIS IS NOT THE MISSING MSVCR90.DLL PROBLEM).Seems like the problem has persisted for quite a while, and Rockstar isn't too keen on fixing it (and has one of the worst customer support websites out there).This is the reason of a negative review - I am yet to play the game. If they fix it at all, that is.The reason why there aren't more negative reviews out here is that I was forced to farm ""playtime"" by repeatedly trying to launch the game to be able to write this time.

												Despite the apparent playtime I have not actually gotten past the launcher for this game. The 0.6 hours (which may be greater by the time this is read) has been fully spent loading the game in Steam, getting to the Rockstar launcher interface, pressing play, and... having the launcher close to the desktop.The game is not currently working on Windows 10. I've tried all of the suggested community fixes and Rockstar's troubleshooting steps and nothing has solved the problem. The game needs an official fix and considering it's been out for years it's not likely to get one. I'll probably be returning it shortly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You're one of the LA's finest, a former military veteran who is looking to build a successful career out of law enforcement in 1940's post World War II L.A. with fancy suits and muscle cars. It's men's world.Playing L.A. Noire is like taking part in an interactive movie. It's more than just watching the action as you get to take part in it. And the outcome of the cases is determined on your gut, your attention to detail, and interrogation skills rather than just wating the actor to state their line. If there is at least a tiny bit of detective in you and you want to get to the bottom of things then you'll find the storyline captivating and it will drag you in like honey.As of gameplay, mouse & keyboard combo is tolerable. Walking and running around with keys and using mouse to look/aim works fine most of the time. Driving is slightly awkward when you want to drive straight or especially when trying to take sharp corners in high speed due to the fact that the camera turns slowly behind the vehicle unless your mouse hand is in sync with your keyboard hand. Many times I've ended up smashing bumpers with oncoming traffic or rear fender taking contact with nearby mailbox or lamp post. However, as this is not the most important mechanic I bare with it. Car chases are still fun.Interrogation of people is the one that gives you the most ""what ifs"". Do I believe what this person is saying with their eyes rolling out of their heads or do I push my luck to squeeze the last bit of information they have? Or do I dare to state they're lying and then provide them with evidence that I know what the real case is? And you'd better have the evidence with such allegation or the conversation may be short lived.The gameplay involves occasional chases both on foot and on wheels, some gunfights and brawls. They play out decently not getting too much attention from the story itself. In overall, there's a nice balance of action, seeking and dialogue to my taste and it keeps me tempted to replay a case after a case until I get the gist of how it should have been.If you have no patience and you couldn't care less about the story then this might not be the game for you. But if you're into the era and the mysteries of police detectives then I highly recommend L.A. Noire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall: 6/10Pros:- The graphics are top notch. This game is a visual pleasure.- The storyline is quite interesting.- Acting and voice overs are unparalleled.Cons:- The interface is clunky, probably the result of a poor conversion from console.- You don't get to do much and what you get to do is somehow repetitive (click here, find clue, choose questions to interrogate suspects, action sequence, end of story)Overall it's a nice to have game just for the visuals, the sounds and to show off how ""cool"" a computer game could be, but it definitely lacks depth, has zero replayability and does not offer much.

												This game is a masterpiece,people who complain about the framerate problems don't know what a community forum is,not to mention how easy it is to fix.It has everything you ever wanted:action,mystery,drugs,a good ol' M1 garand and last but not least a plentiful supply of child molesters.Since im an overachiever (and since I have no life) I completed the achievments where you need to find 50 golden reels and drive all of the cars,and that was painful,took me like 8 hours.The ending killed a part of me.The game is similar to GTA in certain aspects like driving and combat but here your the good guy.No, hollywoodland and vinewood are not set in the same world.Features things to keep you busy with like street crimes and running around the map to find police badges,or those damn reels.The sound of Cole turning a victim's head still hurts to think about.Pick it up on a sale with the dlc,it offers great a bunch of new cases to solve.Oh... and this: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/281847490928408325/F370376017E37670BBD81AC608E3B1B3D7BF2504/(No spoilers).

												Very disappointing, especially coming from Rockstar. High on style, they have most of the cast of Mad Men, but low on gameplay. In fact, it plays like one of those old Police Quest games from 20 years ago. Big missed opp. to have GTA 1950s. And it looks ike thats what happened...they didn't have the budget to finish a full blown GTA, so they tacked on the whole mystery solving thing and shipped it. ---7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game was excellent, it's largely something unlike the majority of game experiences i've had. I really enjoyed the interrogation mechanics and the use of the motion capture technology for the actors faces to be realistically portrayed in the game was just awesome.the game loses some steam right after the early sections, it becomes sort of repetitive and the action sequences (driving and shooting sections) are spaced out a little too far for a few hours of gameplay, but make it through this slower section and the game's story and action pick up and hook you into the experience hard enough to push through to the more exciting final chapters of the game.I experienced a few minor technical issues - mostly with the controls at certain sections of the game, navigating tighter spaces when looking for clues can be a bit clunky and the cover shooting mechanics felt very unpolished and I tended to avoid using the cover system because of that.9.5/10 experience overall. Had the pacing been a little better in the second act of the game, and the control issues not been there it could've been a 10/10. These two small issues didn't keep me from loving the game regardless though. Probably a top 10 game of all time for me.get it now			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great gameplay, but has some updated graphics. This game has an in-depth interrogation engine that changes from person to person. One woman might find it hard to look you in the eye whether she's telling the truth or not, a man might be exceptional at wearing a fake smile, and another might change his story purely because he's scared. Cases have multiple endings depending on what clues you find and how interrogations go, and one person might end a case with an arrest, while another good end it with the suspect in a body-bag. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is a lot like an adventure game, but it's very original and doesn't spare any novelty for that. I found it very enjoyable, a game full of mystery, with a well written story and interesting characters. Action is well done likewise, but it isn't the main focus of the game, instead it's the process of solving a case, finding the truth even though the harder you go, the harder it is. The whole facial animations are great, in fact there are no animations - the facial expressions are taken from real people. Unfortunately it can fall in the Uncanny Valley at times, but you can't blame it for that since, it's trying to succeed. If there would be no initiative - there would be no success. This is a favourite of mine.

												A unique and well presented game. WIth great characters and interesting stories, it was one of those games i couldnt do in one sitting. I found my self playing a case through and then takking a break. But i always came back, i always wanted to comeback and see more flashbacks to Okinawa and see what kind of crime i had to solve next 8.5/10 loved it (but poor PC port held it back at 30 fps)			",115,3,0,11,7,0,24

												All the reviews said it was a slow game, and could only play for am hour. Well I played it for 7 hours straight right after I bought it. It's only one of the games that I've played for 7 hours in one sitting. Extremely good. The only problem I have is deciding if the person is 1. telling the truth 2. not telling the whole truth, or 3. flat out lying. I could just be a sucker for detective games, and never take of my nostalgia glasses, but oh well, One of the best games ever  GTA V/5  another masterpiece from Rockstar.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Generally a good game, it has an interesting story and overall the theme of a 1940's detective works well. However, after the story has been finished there is a lack of things to do and the game quickly becomes repetitive and bland (although the story does justify this). The facial expressions are good and sometimes solving cases can be very difficult, but in a good way. I would recommend this game at £20, and definitely if it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

OLDER VERSION OF THE REVIEW HERE***************************************************THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE GAME ITSELF, BUT ITS CURRENT PLAYABILITYAs you might notice from a lot of recent reviews, L.A. Noire is currently unplayable on Windows 10 64bit, and perhaps other operating systems too.I tried all the fixes out there, checked the integrity of .NET framework (both 3.5 and 4), have latest upgrades and drivers installed. Compatibility modes, run game as administrator, run Steam as administrator, reinstall, check game cache, everything. Nothing worked.It just shows the loading screen after the loader and stops working. Windows Event Viewer shows an error saying 0x40000015 unknown application exception. The faulty module is MSVCR90.dll (part of VS2008 runtime, THIS IS NOT THE MISSING MSVCR90.DLL PROBLEM).Seems like the problem has persisted for quite a while, and Rockstar isn't too keen on fixing it (and has one of the worst customer support websites out there).This is the reason of a negative review - I am yet to play the game. If they fix it at all, that is.The reason why there aren't more negative reviews out here is that I was forced to farm ""playtime"" by repeatedly trying to launch the game to be able to write this time.

												I start with how the PC-Port is: Its pretty bad. Due to the Facial Animations the Game is locked at 30fps and can't be unlocked, so you always have that terrible ""laggy"" Feeling when playing. Other than that it has problems with Downsampling and Windowed(Borderless) Mode. The Graphics overall are pretty terrible, especially the Viewdistance looks like its not changed from the 360 Version.The Game itself is pretty boring and the story never really gets going until close to the End. I got it for 2.49$ together with MaxPayne 3. So it was like 1.25$ + ~1.25€ for the stupid DLC-Pack I felt I had to buy, because its integrates into the Mainstory. Thats pretty cheap, but I would not recommend it for more than that.Its not the worst Game ever, but I had to drag myself through it because I would not get that money I spend for the DLC-Pack get to waste. I paid for it, so I'm gonna play through it, even if I have to force myself. I played it over Month 1-2 Missions a Day, after that I had to quit, because it was too boring.I can't recommend it unless you are a Wannabe Amateur-Detective and want to live that Cinematic 30fps Detective-Life. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LA Noire is a unique and fun game in the aspect of how it plays. The main goals are to collect clues, interview witnesses and solve crimes with a cast of very real characters. I don't mean this lightly, having worked in security and talking with LEO, the different characters are people you will or have met before. The game is nearly six years old now, but still feels and looks pretty modern. Casual and veteran players alike will enjoy most of the game. People living in LA will appreciate the games setting and take on a fictional 1940s. Don't come in expecting action like GTA, it's quite the opposite, but in a nice way. Think of it like listening to music from this time compared to modern tracks. Where I feel the game lacks is namely it's pace after a certain point of the game and it's main character, Cole Phelps. Much like Zero Punctuations comments, Cole comes off as a robot and for me I don't see much change at all. It makes controlling him quite boring after a certain point. Yes, he is a straight as arrow cop wanting to redeem himself, but he's so detached for most of the game it feels a bit akward and the few times he does seem to show emotion or connect, it's almost like filler. Lastly is the ending, I won't spoil it, but to me it felt lackluster and as if the team inteded to make a sequel, but got canned before they could. I still would recommend the game for it's unique approach to gameplay, but don't go in believing all the hype, because honestly, if they had made Cole develop as a character more, and the ending a bit more concluded, I felt the game would have overall been a fair bit better.

												I really wish there was a 'mixed' option because I appreciate what this game was trying to do (and in many regards it succeeded), but ultimately it was ahead of its time and felt lacking in some departments.The game itself, while having an amazing story, complemented by top notch character development felt awefully linear. I often felt like I had to choose what the game wanted me to choose and wasn't allowed any freedom throughout the cases, such as when there are two pieces of evidence that could equally disprove someone, but the game only allows one to be correct, you cannot present both, or one or the other, only the one will be correct; that combined the 30FPS lock is what makes me have mixed opinions about this game.I would still recommend to anybody looking for a crime-thriller, or just a great story driven game in general.It was a great idea by Team Bondi, but unfortunately ahead of its time, I hope someone at Rockstar picks this title up again and we eventually get a sequel.

												You play as a LAPD officer in 1947, trying to make the city a better place. Under the rising silver screen stars of Hollywood and the American dream, lies the dark side of the big city: contraband morphine hits the streets, people die from overdoses, a serial killer is on the run, families are burning in house fires, and a few of your fellow cops workmates are not very clean.This game is awesome, you don't see the time flying by when playing it. The 3D animations and motion captures are very well done. The voice actors are really believeable and the main plot is simply amazing. It is definitely worth a playthrough.			",113,5,3,12,6,0,9

												The suspect was taken into the station. I searched the place for more clues. Didn't get much out of it. I went back to interrogate the suspect. He was with me on okinawa, he was never really my friend, but he wasn't really my enemy. I started with small talk about the war back in the day. But he's fed up and said cut the crap. So i started questioning him about the murder. He got no alibi at the time of death. It was a simple question, but a complex answer.Now the hard part, I have to decide. Is it the truth? Or a doubt? Or maybe a lie. I decided to trust him. And he gave me another lead. I went on with that lead with my partner. It was pretty convincing, so i decided to take him as another suspect and brought him to the station. While searching the place, i found the murder weapon and proceed to interrogate him. He gave an alibi. I chose the lie, and show him the evidence. I charged him, and the DA will do the work next.I went home, not to the usual place. It was a blue room, i saw an angel singing i always kill.  I was tempted. The next morning i went to the office, there's another murder. So i went to the crime scene, expecting a new body. But i was wrong. It's the same mark as before, the murder didn't stop. At that moment i knew that it was him. I went to his place and dragged him back to the station. He insisted that it wasn't him. And i said that's a lie. But it was pretty convincing, so i persuaded him to gave up names. He's a tough guy, he won't gave up his friends. So it must be on our unit back in the army. Just before i went to continue the investigation, the boss called me. There's a picture of me with the germans. My wife left me, and i got demoted. It was my partner, he rat me out. Then i wondered, who's really the enemy, and who's really the friend? I got caught in the truth and the lie. So i forgot the doubt. Then i doubt the LAPD, i doubt my partner, i doubt my wife, i doubt him. And the most important one, i doubt myself. I said goodbye to the angel. Forever.Then i went home to play L.A Noire.

												Fun detective game.  Before you engage in interogating or talking to anyone, search the area for clues.  You can back out of some conversation but once you blow it, you have to reload.Facial animations are incredible, like Deus Ex or better.  But I can't say they're as accurate, sometimes when I think someone is lying they're telling the truth, and when their body language says they're lying, they're telling the truth, or when they seem to be telling the truth they're lying, vice versa.  I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, just seems hard to tell sometimes.  You have a cheat ""intuition"" system that helps you deduce these investisgations, pretty handy.Locked at 30fps, can force 60fps with 3rd party software (Artmoney works).  Awesome at 60, facial animations a little buggy, mostly their blinking is too fast, so they look a little nervy.$5-6 on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire, set in the 1947 Los Angeles, puts you in the shoes of the LAPD detective Cole Phelps. In addition to creating a perfect atmosphere and unbelievably well made set of facial expressions for the characters, the game allows you to dive more deeply into the work of an old school detective.

Best detective/crime game hands down. Voice acting A+ 20 to 30 hour game. Not too long or too short. Just right. Too many side quest to do. Cons. Some side missions repeats. Music repeats.

												L.A. Noire is a fantastic game. I personally give it a 10/10. Because it has a fantastic story that is unparalleled even in today's movies and books. The game play is amazing, and to be honest im gonna leave it towards other people to go on about that. I just wanted to put my peice out there saying that this game is worth your money.But also because i wanted to end all the claims of how bad a port it really is. Yes it is not the best port, but compared to  GTA IV and its GFWL port, it's pretty damn good. People saying 30fps is a con are just wrong, flat out wrong. People need to put it under a plus. 30fps is so smooth in this game, because the engine was NOT designed for 60fps. I myself have played about half an hour at an uncapped 60fps and i couldn't go on any longer, while yes it looks smooth as ♥♥♥♥, the driving is horrible, like driving on a ice skating rink and the brakes don't work, and the facial animations look worse.To fix the framerate though because it does have trouble keeping a solid 30fps. Copy and paste this in your command line in the launch options.-npd -str -nonvIt works for most people, including me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like playing a movie, in the best way imaginable.I've seen previews of it, and I was intrigued. I heard more about it and I really got interested. I saw someone demo it and I was immediately sold. This game is not for everyone, however. It has gritty visuals and intense subject matter. If you like the Black Dahlia film or Noir detective stories, you may like this. The sound direction is superb, and the music is very well done. Some tracks can wear on the nerves, but the action tracks put you in the moment.This game plays very well on Windows 7, but crashes do happen on occasion.Overall, this is a very excellent title, and the actors are superb, for the most part. If you watch Mad Men, you may see more familiar faces than just Phelps. This is a huge leap for in-game visuals, as the talking heads do look very good most of the time. Some glitches can be jarring, but they're few.It's a large game, and requres a lot of RAM and a very capable video card. Nevertheless, it's well worth the visit to 1940's Los Angeles if you want a good detective procedural.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worth reviewing for a lump of coal or a badge. However...Highly engrossing. Some say it's repetitious, probably due to each case essentially having you starting from scratch. I don't see how it's any different to highly popular crime shows. Watch a whole DVD of that in one sitting and I'm sure you'll see repetition too.It was a very ambitious choice to mix a number of elements. Undoubtedly compromises had to be made to make them fit which I think were minimal. I also applaud their foresight to employ new technology and use it to create a critical element of the game (face capture).Finally the atmosphere is just great. So much polish, so much attention to detail. It feels a shame this whole world was built and may never be used again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although there isn't much to do in it other than free roam and a bit of side missions. Facial animations still better than an game to date (except uncharted 4). I'd give the story 9/10. Since it's capped at 30fps (because of the face animation tech) and it's a 2011 game, pretty much any discrete gpu past 2014 can run it at max settings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game a few years ago, but I never got around to playing it because my computer was a potato. However, here I am now having completed the game on my new computer, and here is what I have to say about the game. The game takes place in 1947 Los Angeles, and you are put in the position of a police officer who is working their way up the ladder of law enforcement. The gameplay is in third person, and if you are looking for something like GTA, then look elsewhere. L.A. Noire is a game that requires a lot of decision making and reflection on evidence that you find at multiple crime scenes in each case that you are assigned. Which brings in another mechanic, you have to track down the evidence with is indicated by a sound, or a vibration if you have a controller. I'm going to be honest, in the first few cases it was fun to do the investigations without any guides, but it got old really fast. I ended up going over guides while doing investigations, and this actually helped me with a lot of the achievements, but it takes away from one of the core mechanics of the game, which is to carry out the investigations yourself. Does this make it a terrible game? No. It is a really great game for what it is. It has a good balance of action and investigation, and the story is really good. The graphics aren't really amazing, compared to other things released around the time of this games publication, but this really doesn't detract from the game. Overall, I was disappointed that this wasn't GTA set in 1947, but the game makes up for this with tons of fun little side missions, challenging achievements, and some really funny and interesting dialogue. I would rate this an 8/10 because it has a lot to do, but at some points you will just get really frustrated and want to play something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I powered through L.A. Noire because I enjoyed the story and I found each case to be compelling.  The way it weaved the past into current events and tied things together by the end was legendary.  The way the devs captured the actor's facial expressions, while treading into the uncanny valley big-time, gave this game an amazing quality.  Driving through old time Los Angeles was a lot of fun.  I think this is a game most people will enjoy.All that being said sometimes when characters talk their mouths look really wrong.  It looks like the mesh is the wrong shape for the expression ( usually noticable with yelling and other large mouth shapes).  While historically accurate all the cars look way too much alike to necessate the diversity in this game (especially with the frustrating achievement attached to driving them all).  Getting in and out of cars takes flippin' forever.  Special cars that boast a max speed of 140 MPH even at full throtle the game says your max speed even was around 86 MPH.The main gameplay element of interrigation is frustrating as they purposefully designed it to not allow you to restart a bad interrigation over without quitting and reloading your last save.  Sure, it opens other opportunities to play through the mission based on failure to catch the person in a lie but that wasn't what I was playing this for. Story gripes ahead, Spoilers: The love interest in this game looks like a dirty bag of melted action figures so when Cole started persuing her romatically I didn't buy it for a second.  You are a war hero get a woman that is worth the trouble. The ending was purposefully unsatisfying but come on give a guy some hope that Cole's work wasn't for nothing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid, interesting crime thriller, but with rough edges. Good things:-Paints an incredible atmosphere of 1940s L.A., with stunning historical detail. -Unique and innovative way of moving through cases based on being able to read lies through social cues. -Interesting companions with a lot of fun, banter-y dialogue. -Fun car chase mechanics - you can't run over citizens when you're a cop, so you have to restrain your GTA urges. -Really strong voice acting and motion capture.Bad things:-Driving AI is atrocious - other cars will swerve straight into you, and you suffer the blame for it. Also, civilians are horrible at avoiding your police car, even with full sirens blazing. -The Truth/Doubt/Lie mechanic can be a little harsh and often slightly unfair with how it determines a 'correct' response. -Slightly repetitive and formulaic for the first 3/4 of the game. -Roy Earle's existence. I'd definitely recommend picking this game up in a sale, especially for the thrilling crime atmosphere of a noir cop. At full price, though, I'd have to think hard about recommending it, because it often frustrated me, or felt a little too repetitive by the middle sections.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games Rockstar ever made? La Noire is about a cop named Cole Phelps that keeps getting promoted (from Patol desk then all the way until arson desk.) you can do it in color or in Black and White (I think Black and White is better for this type of game.) this game is like is like a lie dectector, but you have to pay attention to details instead of a machine telling it or no. when asking questions to witnesses you can choose 3 things when they answer, Truth, Doubt or lie. this is when paying attention to details comes in you have to see how they have say their answers and their face expressions they have also pay attention to how many times they blink or move their head all over the place. but without anymore detail about the game it's a true classic game and a masterpiece of a game. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As well as the landmarks that were painstakingly recreated, as well as the traffic patterns and the streets in general. So much detail was put into this game, and im still finding out new things about this in 2016.

It’s a huge game, that took me something like 50 hours to clear. However, you have to come into it aware that the game mechanics are somewhat of a bore. The vastness of the story elements contrasts with the limited gameplay. The open city is a good thing, the cars and such too, but if you’re expecting Rockstar’s GTA controls and gameplay, you’ll be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not many games have had the detective feel and for me this was the best. I really like the idea of having a police game set in the 50's. Rockstar Games did great on this game.... L.A Norie is essentially a ""story change"" of Mafia 2 xD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a detective game and find the CSI series too boring you should definitely buy L.A. Noire. The game's set in 1947, after the second world war. The gameplay is set in an open world similar to GTA. You work cases, ranging from homicide, vice, arson and traffic as the main story line unfolds itself. You can play the game multiple times and discover new clues which lead to a deeper understanding of a case. You may miss vital parts or accuse an innocent person, or let a guilty one go if you don't find all evidence and process each crime scene. Definitely buy this game it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Be a detective in an immersive 1940's Las Angeles setting. This game has a nice mix of adventure and action. Find clues, interrigate suspects and solve cases. The story is good, nice voice acting, realistic character animations, good graphics and sound. I preferred playing this with a game-controller, but it also works fine with keyboard and mouse. Overall, I found the game to be enjoyable and it kept my interest to the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Let's Play L. A. Noire: Craziest Glitch Ever! Headless Game in Medias Res! Nosy Old Hag, No Head Bug 
A Video of L.A. Noire
By: Knave of Hearts

			Watch the rest of my playthrough of L.A. Noire, starting from Homicide department and cases related to the BD Tex / Black Dahlia murders:...		


Worst PC port ever, to even launch the game you need to find somewhere and download an old version of Rockstar Social Club, install in, back it up, let the game autoupdate it (it won't launch without updating and the last update doesn't load the game) THEN delete the new version and restore your backup. After all of that you need to set compatibility in the new back♥♥♥♥♥♥way for Windows 7/8 and repeat every time before launching... A hidden gamble is if it'll launch from Steam directly or from the game folder. It's like roulette, really! ""Rockstar"" can't do PC games and swindled actual developer (Team Bondi) out of money... even Japanese developers with no experience on PC make better ports. Never buying a game from a publisher with such a pretentious name, even on a big sale. Oh and it's so full of bugs it's barely playable.That said, the game itself is amazing. ""Rockstar"" games just needs to crawl under a rock and slowly die, since they manage to be a publisher worse than EA, Ubisoft and Capcom all together.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good graphics for a 2011 game. It's still not bad today. The map is large, detailed, and accurate to actual los angeles. Although there isn't much to do in it other than free roam and a bit of side missions. Facial animations still better than an game to date (except uncharted 4). I'd give the story 9/10. Since it's capped at 30fps (because of the face animation tech) and it's a 2011 game, pretty much any discrete gpu past 2014 can run it at max settings.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game a few years ago, but I never got around to playing it because my computer was a potato. However, here I am now having completed the game on my new computer, and here is what I have to say about the game. The game takes place in 1947 Los Angeles, and you are put in the position of a police officer who is working their way up the ladder of law enforcement. The gameplay is in third person, and if you are looking for something like GTA, then look elsewhere. L.A. Noire is a game that requires a lot of decision making and reflection on evidence that you find at multiple crime scenes in each case that you are assigned. Which brings in another mechanic, you have to track down the evidence with is indicated by a sound, or a vibration if you have a controller. I'm going to be honest, in the first few cases it was fun to do the investigations without any guides, but it got old really fast. I ended up going over guides while doing investigations, and this actually helped me with a lot of the achievements, but it takes away from one of the core mechanics of the game, which is to carry out the investigations yourself. Does this make it a terrible game? No. It is a really great game for what it is. It has a good balance of action and investigation, and the story is really good. The graphics aren't really amazing, compared to other things released around the time of this games publication, but this really doesn't detract from the game. Overall, I was disappointed that this wasn't GTA set in 1947, but the game makes up for this with tons of fun little side missions, challenging achievements, and some really funny and interesting dialogue. I would rate this an 8/10 because it has a lot to do, but at some points you will just get really frustrated and want to play something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is an incredible interactive experience where you play the role of a detective in a wide variety of different police cases. The first noticeable thing is the amazing detail of the faces. And this is important because it is the player's job to determine whether people are telling the truth or lying based on their facial expressions during interviews.The gameplay is essentially broken down into driving to different scenes, searching for clues, interviewing people, and occasionally chasing down suspects. It is really unlike any other game on the market and it does a great job at drawing you in. Musical chimes are used to let you know when you are next to something relevant so it is important to keep an open ear.The story feels realistic and is broken into shorter chapters meaning it's easy to pick up again after not playing it for a while. The acting is superb. All the characters feel genuine and it is obvious they put their heart and soul into their roles adding to that sense of realism. The game also showcases some great music as well. With 30+ hours of enjoyment, this is a must play game in my book.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was really interesting that Rockstar came up with slightly unique game play like this, I'd say great job, Bondi Games!The strong point of this games is that it will lure you deep to the mysteries, forcing you not to left behind any clues for your satisfaction. Also the graphics and the 40's LA background are the huge bonus to the already great detective game.I suggest you to stop reading and go get this game. :)p.s.The only disappointing point is that this game only packed very few cases. It should has more thrilling cases, at least from DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid, interesting crime thriller, but with rough edges. Good things:-Paints an incredible atmosphere of 1940s L.A., with stunning historical detail. -Unique and innovative way of moving through cases based on being able to read lies through social cues. -Interesting companions with a lot of fun, banter-y dialogue. -Fun car chase mechanics - you can't run over citizens when you're a cop, so you have to restrain your GTA urges. -Really strong voice acting and motion capture.Bad things:-Driving AI is atrocious - other cars will swerve straight into you, and you suffer the blame for it. Also, civilians are horrible at avoiding your police car, even with full sirens blazing. -The Truth/Doubt/Lie mechanic can be a little harsh and often slightly unfair with how it determines a 'correct' response. -Slightly repetitive and formulaic for the first 3/4 of the game. -Roy Earle's existence. I'd definitely recommend picking this game up in a sale, especially for the thrilling crime atmosphere of a noir cop. At full price, though, I'd have to think hard about recommending it, because it often frustrated me, or felt a little too repetitive by the middle sections.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More like a movie rather than a game, L.A. Noire is a splendid interactive translation of a noir novel, in particular Black Dhalia and L.A. Confidential by J. Ellroy (which I also recommend). The 1950 Los Angeles is immersive and realistically reproduced, framing a brilliant plot and a character developement worthy of a book. Interactive dialogues are the soul of the game, being also the key to conduct interrogatories and solve cases: for this purpose a very detailed facial motion capture permits to evaluate emotional reactions and to expose lies. Detective work is realistic and capturing, allowing personal investigation lines and always letting the player to deduce and judge in first person.Although cinematographic narration overwhelms the gameplay, L.A.

												CSI: Los Angeles 1947 style...Developed by Team Bondi, L.A. Noire sets you up as detective Cole Phelps. Unlike in previous Rockstar entries (ie GTA), you play asThe story is unique and has a few twists to keep you interested. You start of as a rookie cop, after returning home from army service from Japan. After a series of cases you move onto different cases including homicide, vice and arson. Gameplay involves a mix between evidence gathering, chases and combat. In each case, you need to look to look for clues at the crime scene. This will involve interacting with items at the scene (picking up and observing stuff) as well as questioning witnesses. When you intereact with items (e.g. bodies, cups etc) you can move the item around to observe them from different angle and therefore hopefully finding the sclues you need. Some of the items that you pick up at the crime scene may add no value to solving the case what so ever, so they would have best been left uninteractable to the player to save time.A unique mechanic to the game are the detailed facial expressions from characters. You need to look at character's facial expressions closely when asking questions to tell whether they are telling the truth, lying or you have doubts. If you choose truth, then you proceed in asking other questions. The lie option involves you showing proof (from the evidence you collected) that they are indeed lieing. The doubt option is used when you have a feeling that they are lieing, but you don't have the evidence to back it up. Furthermore, you may recognise some of the faces from actors you know.Combat is decent but not spectacular. You are limited to the weapons that are in you police trunk. Most of time you will have a shotgun in the trunk,but if you have DLC you can get the tommy gun as well. There is a cover system, so you can hide behind cover such as cars, buidlings and furntiture to avoid bullets and heal. Your health is indicated by the screen turning red and regenerates over time when you're not being shot. You can also pick up enemy weapons if you ran out of ammo. Combat is quite rare and generally occurs near the ending levels of the game during police raids or chases.During chases the aim is  to catch and interrogate the suspect. this involves sprinting at them and trying not to get too far behind. When you are close enough,  you need to aim your gun at the suspect for a period of time before you can apprehend him. Sometimes chases may be in vehicles,. In this circumstance, you need to chase and ram the other vehicle until they get stuck and therefore arrested.There is a free roaming element to the game, however your activities are far more limited than GTA. You can't pull out your gun and shoot civilians. You can ram down civilians during cases, but that will lower your score. You can't buy stuff either and there are only a limited number of buildings  you may enter. There are some random crimes which you can solve while free roaming the city as well as collectable items and cars. Otherwise your free roaming options are more limited compared to GTA games.The audio is fantastic. Music does a great job at settiing the 1940's atmosphere. Character voice acting sounds perfect as well.The graphics are decent for the time. Character modles may not look that great, but the city of Los Angeles definitely looks like it was from the 1940's. There are some noticeable landmarks as well, which you can find.If you're looking for a detective game that oozes with 'Noire' feeling and American 1940's atmosphere, then L.A. Noire is the game for you. However, those looking for a GTA game will be dissapointed. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also the graphics and the 40's LA background are the huge bonus to the already great detective game.I suggest you to stop reading and go get this game. :)p.s.The only disappointing point is that this game only packed very few cases.

It strongly focuses on the crime puzzles with the well mixed action sequences such as car chases or shootouts. Interrogating the suspects are better then most detective genera games with one of the latest (back in the 7th gen) motion face capture.

												Great, immersive tale with brilliant acting and atmosphere. Slightly low replay value, especially when compared to Grand Theft Auto series, but it is rewarded with intriguing story.

												Solid, interesting crime thriller, but with rough edges. Good things:-Paints an incredible atmosphere of 1940s L.A., with stunning historical detail. -Unique and innovative way of moving through cases based on being able to read lies through social cues. -Interesting companions with a lot of fun, banter-y dialogue. -Fun car chase mechanics - you can't run over citizens when you're a cop, so you have to restrain your GTA urges. -Really strong voice acting and motion capture.Bad things:-Driving AI is atrocious - other cars will swerve straight into you, and you suffer the blame for it. Also, civilians are horrible at avoiding your police car, even with full sirens blazing. -The Truth/Doubt/Lie mechanic can be a little harsh and often slightly unfair with how it determines a 'correct' response. -Slightly repetitive and formulaic for the first 3/4 of the game. -Roy Earle's existence. I'd definitely recommend picking this game up in a sale, especially for the thrilling crime atmosphere of a noir cop. At full price, though, I'd have to think hard about recommending it, because it often frustrated me, or felt a little too repetitive by the middle sections.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the game you would get if you dont have enough money for gta 5 but want some rockstar goodness. I played through this 3 times on pc only, while i beat the hell out of it on 360. Its definently replayable, with the many secret clues that can actually completely change the case. As well as the landmarks that were painstakingly recreated, as well as the traffic patterns and the streets in general. So much detail was put into this game, and im still finding out new things about this in 2016. Please, grab this game if its on sale or even at full price if youre willing enough to play a very story driven boner inducing game.

												apparently there are a lot of people posting bad reviews recently for no good reason.edit: apparently there were issues with launching the game after a broken steam update, should be fixed now.also people wondering why this game wasen't fixed sooner, well it was a steam issue not with the game and also the developer doesn't even exist anymore...this game is an absolute must play for anyone with even the remotest intrest in detective stuff/police stuff, or just a open world game with a good story.it has only 2 flaws;1. driving controlls are kinda wierd but easy to get used to.2. locked to 30 fps, can't do anything about it because it would mess up the facial animations (one of the games greatest features.)pros include but are not limited to;1.great story2.beautifull recreaton of 40's L.A.3.amazing facial animation's of actual recorded actor's wich brings us too the next point.4.excellent acting most of the time, though some side characters are clearly lower budget.5.enough collectables, though not really the focus of the game (cars, land marks.)

												L.A. Noire is an incredible interactive experience where you play the role of a detective in a wide variety of different police cases. The first noticeable thing is the amazing detail of the faces. And this is important because it is the player's job to determine whether people are telling the truth or lying based on their facial expressions during interviews.The gameplay is essentially broken down into driving to different scenes, searching for clues, interviewing people, and occasionally chasing down suspects. It is really unlike any other game on the market and it does a great job at drawing you in. Musical chimes are used to let you know when you are next to something relevant so it is important to keep an open ear.The story feels realistic and is broken into shorter chapters meaning it's easy to pick up again after not playing it for a while. The acting is superb. All the characters feel genuine and it is obvious they put their heart and soul into their roles adding to that sense of realism. The game also showcases some great music as well. With 30+ hours of enjoyment, this is a must play game in my book.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting cases, very good (and long) story. Sometimes a little unfair on the question/answer parts (at least for a non-native english speaker). Still fun and full of carefully elaborated characters. Playing it now on modern hardware eliminates the clunkyness of the PC controls - seems to be a little buggy on minimum required hardware. Facial animation is even today second to none. The ""open world"" city is quite empty but each crime scene or other enterior has been crafted very carefully. Extremely high production value wherever you look.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played it on the PS3 and had one disk stop working on me completley and another where halfway through I couldn't stop falling through the floor. But the PC port? It should be taken to the slammer. It's the best way to play it out of all versions but is capped at 30 by default. It can easily be uncapped but the performance woes don't stop there. Getting near houses related to a case has brought my previous PC builds to a DayZ crawl. Good game bad port. Still reccomend this over a PS3 or 360 copy though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can i say? after a couple of hours playing this game, i just fell completely in love with it.Imagine freedom as in GTA. But as a cop. An honest cop.Get your case assignments, try to be as honest and good as possible. Question suspects and witnesses. Decide who's lying or telling the truth. Search for clues at crime scenes. Go and assist other crimes. Or just don't. Be a good boy and run after your fleeing suspects, or shoot them down.Drive carefully, or be a gung-ho.It's all up to you. The character conversations are incredible. The lip-sync used in this, is just the best i've ever seen. At the beginning, i had to just open a browser, and confirm if that voice was Liam Neeson's. It was.Whatever you do.. Buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Америка 50-х годов, одна из моих самых любимых тем для игр. Обычно нам давали побегать за мафиози, и мы в его роли проварачивали всякие грязные делишки, постепенно становясь более искусной машиной для убийств.. В данной же игре нам предлагают примерить костюм защитника закона, честного и неподкупного полицейского в лице Коула Фелпса. Честно говоря, сначала игра мне не очень понравилась, все казалось через чур простым, но затем дела пошли более трудные, улики оказались спрятаны по всей окрестности, а во время допроса уже стало трудно определить, лжет ли ваш собеседник, или говорит правду. Сюжет в игре выше всяких похвал: он показывает нам коррупционную сторону правительства, да и не только его. Обязательно поиграйте в L.A. Noire и станьте свидетелем жизни обычного человека, который боролся против преступного, лживого, коррупционного мира Города Ангелов.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8.5/10 Masterpiece. The game took 5 years to finish the development and you can see why as you play.The game invites you to a world of crime and do not hold your hand while you do your best not to miss any single clues or ask the wrong questions. It is surprisingly realistic when it comes to investigations, and if you enjoy crime themed shows, or enjoy books like Sherlock etc, this IS the game for you. Especially the intensive interview part of the game is unique and you really have to look into your notes (that you took while investigating) and read their expressions, tones etc to really hack the cases. As the game progresses the case gets harder and harder and it pushes you little bit at a time.Overall, the game is beautiful and well designed and the gameplay is solid and unique. Although the freedom part of the game is relatively inclusive but it is intentional in order to focus you to the police work.The only thing I dont like about the game is the fact that it requires quite a good computer considering the fact that the game came out quite a long time ago... but still, a masterpiece.

But for all that, you get an beautiful and immersive world. Just driving in period Los Angeles is worth the price of admission to this game, But on top of that you get great music, complex characters and great dialog.

												Such a great game. The story, the facial expressions, the humor of it is so perfect. You play as a cop in the 40's and work your way up the ranks by completing the missions assigned to you, the game starts out pretty fast but gets slower by the last ""desk"". My favorite part of this game was the homicide desk because there was so much mystery involved, therefore making it so you have to search everything contributing to your addiction to the game. This game is great and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of playing as a gangster in the GTA series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember an argument when this game came out that Cole Phelps was a weak character because his actions seemed unlikeable and his character was definately flawed. We see him throughout the game being torn down by his own past , we no longer see him cling to the ivory tower of hypocrisy we saw him in, in the beginning of the game. Playing as Jack Kelso at the end is supposed to make us feel like we made a mistake judging Phelps too early because Kelso is a character who is way too nice and lets others trample over him just so he can call himself an honorary man who lives for a higher purpose. But after the ending, you realize that Phelps was right to abandon his fortune for his passion, that there is no higher purpose but to live with what you want out of life and to chase what you want with reckless abandon. His mistake was joining the marines with this mentality and getting most of his men killed in battle and many more civilians killed. In the end, Elsa healed Cole but when let his guard down, he got the retribution he deserved not for commiting adultery but commiting an act of hubris that led to a long and winding path of death and misery. If you think about it this way, Cole was the suspect the whole time, becasue his warcrimes led to most of the game's murder cases.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First thing first, I need to mention that I'm not a big fan of Rockstar game at all even GTA, but this game is nailing me. The gameplay and system in videogame are amazing. If you like investigating and intellectual game, I proudly recommend this game! If you look for something like GTA or MAFIA II, I would say you need to pass on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												CONS:- The game ends.- Team Bondi (the developer) was liquidated 5 years ago. PROS:- Superb acting.- Incredible graphics. MotionScan tech was expensive, but incredible!- The story, OH THE STORY!!!- Main missions (especially the ones from the Homicide Department)- Secondary missions are very interesting: shootouts, crazy jumpers, car chases, a few hostages here and there... oh, and some of the perps probably were into cardio, they sure run a lot!I urge every living soul to get this game.

												Just finished it tonight, and I don't say this lightly: Best videogame ever. Perfectly balanced in terms of difficulty, visually beautiful, but what really makes it is the story / script. Absolutely brilliant and gripping all the way to the shocking end. If you don't own this alreay, you need to. If you own it but haven't finished it, you need to. Does require a reasonably modern mid-spec PC - you won't likely enjoy it so much on your laptop.			",187,27,5,7,7,0,6

												Usually I try to finish the games I start as quickly as possible. I do the side quests, I try some achievements, but before playing any other game I try to finish what I started. That’s not the case with LA Noire: I avoid playing it. Why? Because it is in another league completely. The game is so good I’m taking my time to finish it. Literally MONTHS. I simply don’t want to end the story too quickly, I’m sipping it.The graphics are amazing, playing in 1080p with ‘quality’ settings and DX11 is an incredible experience. On the downside, there’s a 30fps lock, but that doesn’t compromise the gameplay because the action isn’t frantic. I find the game to be historically accurate as well. It definitely portrays the beginning of the American “Golden Age” (check the “Old Economy Steven” MEME for further references) in a clear-cut manner. There’s a “Bukowskian” atmosphere surrounding the setting and the characters (Bukowski was living in Los Angeles during the 40’s and both “Ham on Rye” and “Factotum” are accurate descriptions of that period). Coincidence or not, there’s a character in the game named “Bekowsky”...The characters are cynical, disillusioned, smoking drunkards, racist sexist♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the “noir femme fatales” shares many of the features of the male characters. LA is portrayed as a XX century Babylonian city packed with all sorts of lowlifes, degenerates, powerful and perverted directors and producers (L.A. didn't changed all that much, huh?). Due to its dedication to the Noir genre the game ends up rated Mature. This definitely isn’t a game for young gents. There’s plenty of nudity in some crime scenes, and the developers don’t hide anything, which is great, otherwise the game couldn’t qualify as a proper Noir-detective title.Since I have already established that this game is a marvelous piece of art, let’s see the cons:•	30 fps lock.•	Rockstar Social Club is required to play the game.•	The aforementioned Rockstar Social Club will eventually request your password, and you won’t remember it because the password needs to be 300 characters long, with 20 special characters, numbers and 125 capital letters. Why? Why??•	Every time you update the Rockstar Social Club, which is mandatory, otherwise the game won’t start… it’ll request your password again. And guess what: that 300 characters password you created 4 months ago won’t work because YOU WON’T REMEMBER IT. And when you request to reset it, all sorts of issues are going to popup. Seriously, you can count on it.•	Rockstar Social Club again. It’s useless. It’s dead weight and it’s sadistic towards the gamers. Steam offers everything a gamer needs, we don’t need extra-layers of crappy proprietary-software between us and the fun. It’s some sort of annoyance toll.•	Rockstar Social Club is worse than Uplay . There, I said it.Other than that the game is a 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just as advertised, playing this game feels like going through a serious of noir films full of action and drama.You have to hand it to the developers, the facial animations in this game is unlike everything you have ever seen, the characters in this game, regardless of how small his/her role is, are all done with the most top notce animation and voice acting that are just incredibly fun to watch. The gameplay itself, however, lacks the consistent quality in the animations. While at the beginning most of the cases are creative and fun, towards the end you start seeing more and more recurring themes and events that takes outo the freshness of the game. The city, while big, also felt a bit hollow as there aren't really much going on at any given time.Overall I'd give this game an 8/10, a truly refreshing entry in modern gaming			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												We're talking about classic Rockstar Games Hi-Quality merchandise here :)L.A. Noire is an amazingly new and fresh concept, in a market that only tries to repeat itself.L.A. Noire is an investigative game in which you are brought to solve many interesting cases as a L.A.P.D. detective.The cases are varied and amazingly well written, ranging from Traffic cases, to Arson cases, ending with Homicide and Vice.From time to time, while you solve these cases, you have to perform other tasks like shootouts or car chases ecc...so the game keeps things interesting for the player.The best feature of the game is the connection you enstablish with the main character.It's not just a linear progression of cases to solve, but you actually follow the intriguing story of the main character Cole Phelps, and all the cases are all connected into a hidden understory which is very engaging.The topics that are dealt with are different, but the atmosphere reminds of L.A. Confidential.The overall graphics are pretty good and the game features a groundbraking facial animation technology which feels strange at first, but then delivers some of the most realistic facial expressions seen in a game, and the best thing is that they are not just for show, they are very important for the gameplay, since you have to check suspects facial expressions (even the smallest details) during interrogations, to spot if they are lying or not.The Los Angeles reconstruction is incredible; the city is ENORMOUS! It almost feels life-size.The player is immersed in a very realistic and detailed representation of the most glamorous city in the world (L.A.), in its prime time (the 1940s, after the war).A great experience, and if you are a patient player you'll be rewarded with one of the best games available on the market.Pros:- The Main Character, which is more multi-layered and constructed than it might look at the beginning- Amazing cases; the developers had great ideas for every case, and you feel engaged to discover the truth- Varied experience (The case-solving is alternated with other activities)- Brilliant interrogations system (you need to take care of the clues and the interrogated person's facial expressions)- L.A. is detailed and beautiful- Engaging story, linking all the cases togheter- Long gameCons:- There's a bit of aliasing, even if you activate antialiasing- Needs a patient player to be appreciated and completed (Not a negative point, but it's just to let you know)- The city is BIG...maybe too big, and some driving phases are a bit boringRecommended!

												You have to sign up for Rockstar's Social Club in order to play the game. While playing the game, everything hinges on finding clues and interviewing suspects. However, clear evidence to catch suspects in a lie sometimes isn't, you have to guess what the developers were thinking instead of working the evidence in the case as if you were a detective. Addresses and items that you find sometimes don't appear in your evidence book. So it's a linear storyline that you have no real control over. The lead character that you play is also really annoying, and you have to hear his voice for the entire game. You build relationships with characters and they are angry with you one minute, then coming to your defense the next, or vice versa. There's no believability in the flow of the gameplay. They could have done a lot better. This game is a time suck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I feel the driving is a bit off though; Press A or D once and you almost do a 360, but car chases are still fun. Music is of course good as well being set in the 40's.

Confidential.The overall graphics are pretty good and the game features a groundbraking facial animation technology which feels strange at first, but then delivers some of the most realistic facial expressions seen in a game, and the best thing is that they are not just for show, they are very important for the gameplay, since you have to check suspects facial expressions (even the smallest details) during interrogations, to spot if they are lying or not.The Los Angeles reconstruction is incredible; the city is ENORMOUS! It almost feels life-size.The player is immersed in a very realistic and detailed representation of the most glamorous city in the world (L.A.), in its prime time (the 1940s, after the war).A great experience, and if you are a patient player you'll be rewarded with one of the best games available on the market.Pros:- The Main Character, which is more multi-layered and constructed than it might look at the beginning- Amazing cases; the developers had great ideas for every case, and you feel engaged to discover the truth- Varied experience (The case-solving is alternated with other activities)- Brilliant interrogations system (you need to take care of the clues and the interrogated person's facial expressions)- L.A. is detailed and beautiful- Engaging story, linking all the cases togheter- Long gameCons:- There's a bit of aliasing, even if you activate antialiasing- Needs a patient player to be appreciated and completed (Not a negative point, but it's just to let you know)- The city is BIG...maybe too big, and some driving phases are a bit boringRecommended!

												Usually I try to finish the games I start as quickly as possible. I do the side quests, I try some achievements, but before playing any other game I try to finish what I started. That’s not the case with LA Noire: I avoid playing it. Why? Because it is in another league completely. The game is so good I’m taking my time to finish it. Literally MONTHS. I simply don’t want to end the story too quickly, I’m sipping it.The graphics are amazing, playing in 1080p with ‘quality’ settings and DX11 is an incredible experience. On the downside, there’s a 30fps lock, but that doesn’t compromise the gameplay because the action isn’t frantic. I find the game to be historically accurate as well. It definitely portrays the beginning of the American “Golden Age” (check the “Old Economy Steven” MEME for further references) in a clear-cut manner. There’s a “Bukowskian” atmosphere surrounding the setting and the characters (Bukowski was living in Los Angeles during the 40’s and both “Ham on Rye” and “Factotum” are accurate descriptions of that period). Coincidence or not, there’s a character in the game named “Bekowsky”...The characters are cynical, disillusioned, smoking drunkards, racist sexist♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the “noir femme fatales” shares many of the features of the male characters. LA is portrayed as a XX century Babylonian city packed with all sorts of lowlifes, degenerates, powerful and perverted directors and producers (L.A. didn't changed all that much, huh?). Due to its dedication to the Noir genre the game ends up rated Mature. This definitely isn’t a game for young gents. There’s plenty of nudity in some crime scenes, and the developers don’t hide anything, which is great, otherwise the game couldn’t qualify as a proper Noir-detective title.Since I have already established that this game is a marvelous piece of art, let’s see the cons:•	30 fps lock.•	Rockstar Social Club is required to play the game.•	The aforementioned Rockstar Social Club will eventually request your password, and you won’t remember it because the password needs to be 300 characters long, with 20 special characters, numbers and 125 capital letters. Why? Why??•	Every time you update the Rockstar Social Club, which is mandatory, otherwise the game won’t start… it’ll request your password again. And guess what: that 300 characters password you created 4 months ago won’t work because YOU WON’T REMEMBER IT. And when you request to reset it, all sorts of issues are going to popup. Seriously, you can count on it.•	Rockstar Social Club again. It’s useless. It’s dead weight and it’s sadistic towards the gamers. Steam offers everything a gamer needs, we don’t need extra-layers of crappy proprietary-software between us and the fun. It’s some sort of annoyance toll.•	Rockstar Social Club is worse than Uplay . There, I said it.Other than that the game is a 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A Noire delivers an exceptional story focusing on the exploits of a WWII officer turned detective in post-WWII L.A. The game efficiently blends story within story (past and present), via chapters that seamlessly blend together, efficiently creating a believable narration of one mans journey though a troubled time, and a troubled country. The game boasts amazing facial animation techniques, thus creating a greater range of viable facial contortions for the actors to express. The authenticity of the time is expressed in great detail as shown with the vehicle designs, the setting of the city, the music, and the people. The game boasts an extremely interactive environment in the form of interrogations, crime solving, clue searching (all being core aspects of gameplay), and in a most realistic way. Vehicular chases of any sort are exhilarating and finely executed (as well as the pedestrian chases), although general movement is a tad clunky, and unfortunately the combat mechanics are relatively mediocre, if fluent and stable. In conclusion: L.A Noire is well worth your time and your money, and is a must have for any fan of the mystery/thriller genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many people think that L.A. Noire is something like Mafia but they are wrong. Those games have common only the age of story maybe. The biggest difference is in the adventure part of L.A. Noire, you'll have to find evidences and to speak with suspect people mostly in the gameplay. Though shootouts aren't frequent (just in optional missions and at the end of the game) and if you get to some they are boring, the investigations of cases are seriously funny and the system of dialogs is great. You have to decide, if suspect person says truth or lies at the moment. If you choose a lie, you must prove your contention by the appropriate evidence that you have found. You can make a pressure per person as well, if you are not sure. The storyline is higher than average and the surroudings of the City of Angels is very nice. I recommend to buy DLC's as well, there are the best cases in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those game that you must have played at least once. The technology used on the faces is almost in an uncanny valley kinda of thing, but it's still very enjoyable.As a detective in a 1947 L.A., that is pretty detailing and very accurate picture of the city in the past, you're suppose to discover the truth, see behind the lies of the all the suspects and find the one truth. And you gotta do that not just by using evidence, à la Ace Attorney, but also by reading the physiology of the person in front of you (well, it's more the face, and their expression but you get the point).Anyway, is a good game and with an awesome scenario and very interesting features. Definitely worth a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played some of this game. Not enough that I can give spoilers, but enough that I think I can make a decision. The decision is this: Wasted. Potential. In a summary, I'd say this was an elaborate point and click adventure. That's not a bad thing. If you enjoy your clicky adventures little on the easy side, then no-probs. It's awesome.Story is broken up into separate little ""cases"", investigating whatever crime of the day. This means even short sessions can be satisfying enough.The only problem is, it's a shoddy console port. Can't ever trust Rockstar in this respect. Look up. It was released Nov 2011. It even looks like Nov 2011. It's not eye-poppingly beautiful either. Maybe some complex (read ""stupidly archaic and inefficient"") shading, that's it. It runs horribly. Unless you've got a beast of a machine, you shouldn't be playing this game. Just don't. If you do, then go ahead. You won't get the top-notch graphics your machine might be usually chugging out, but you will get a completely unique experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I have ever played! LOVED IT9/10---------------------------------Simply brilliant piece of game art. There is not much talk around this gem but LA NOIRE sits up there with those Half lifes, GTAs, Mass Effects or whatever best game you know.It has such a great story, and great ... is GREAT. You are going to feel like you are part of a noire film from the 30's. I freakin loved that. It is so greatly written and it is quite deep so I experieced that feeling ""I need to do something else but ♥♥♥♥in hell I need to know who killed that woman"" and then spent like another 4 hours playing LA NOIRE.The reason why LA NOIRE is underappreciated is that it is quite a different game. It stands between Tomb Raider, GTA and Sherlock Holmes adventures. You are not gonna shoot everybody you meet and you are not gonna have an opportunity to do that. This game is not about shooting or car chasing... it so complex that you forget you are playing a GAME.Simply loved it. If you love detective style films.. you're gonna love LA NOIRE too. It just feel so real.AMAZING GAME!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Замечательная игра. , Достаточно однотипный игровой процесс делают своё дело и где-то после половины игры начинаешь ощущать скуку, игра начинает надоедать. У меня было желание забросить прохождение игры. Но к счастью я этого не сделал и не пожалел: сюжет начал колбаситься из стороны в сторону увлекая меня за собой.  В общем, если вам игра понравилась изначально, не бросайте прохождение на середине - обязательной пройдите её до конца.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story of ""Why I love this awful game...""This game is bad... really bad... You are given this big city in which you are not allowed to do anything. Literally, you can run or drive around, hoping to find crime scene in which you start totally generic and boring missions where you do few thing over and over again... You are trying to catch someone, or fight, or shoot... It's always more or less, the same...Not including gun fights, which are somewhat ok, melee fighting and running is awful... Hand to hand combat looks like two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, trying to hit each-other, and running controls are usually too sensitive, and there are some obstacles that you cannot jump or pass, although they are easily accessible... The worst part of running is that, you usually cannot outrun anyone... You just run until they are cornered in which case you either start a hand-to-hand fight (OMG!!!) or just catch them... And, hand to hand fighting almost always starts when they ""hide"" behind the corner and wait for you to pass and ""surprise"" you... Ofcourse, you see them, they are standing there, their hand is there, dangling around the corner, map shows the big dot of your assailant, but you can't do anything, you just need to pass and be hit like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moron...Car driving is also pretty dull... All cars feel pretty much the same, and, given the time period, are pretty slow, but that is understandable...And, the most awful thing is actually trying to follow someone... Be it either on foot or in the car... You just need to be extremely slow, and if they catch you, do it all over again... Ok, that is the point of following, but THAT IS NOT FUN! And this is the game, and if you really need to do it, don't do it 100 times... It's boring...So, when you think that questioning system is nice... It is, really, not... Whenever someone answers your question, you must either say that they are telling the truth, you can doubt their answer or tell that they are lying (in which case you must have the evidence)... In the first half, you can easily tell when someone is not telling the truth, so just doubt it, if you have no evidence... But near the end of the game, there are some questions, when you just can't tell if someone is telling the truth, and you don't have evidence for lying... So... good luck, 50/50 doubt or truth... Well, ok, it's not supposed to be easy, far from that, but I want it to be as near to perfect as possible, and you cannot load conversation again... :/ This is not so important and bad as those problems mentioned above, but could've been better...But... As the title said... Why I LOVE this awful game...Although whole game is really bad in terms of almost any game mechanics... It is one fantastic interactive movie... Voice acting is great, facial expressions are fantastic and story just feels real almost all the time... Especially when you reach the Arson department, when things start to unroll...Characters also feel real, and I really started to understand their motivations, fears and emotions... From that point of view, this game is amazing...So, TLDR; This game should have been a movie... It is an awful game experience, with absolutely amazing actors and story writers... I will recommend it just for that, because when I finished it, I really wanted to ""play"" it again and see all the characters, their stories and ends...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the odd ball of Rockstar's games. Being a school bully, an ex-outlaw, a psychopath, or a gangster is pretty cool, but have you ever wanted to be a cop? Probably not. A detective? HELL YEAH! The game is pretty much based around crucial information you gather to reach a conclusion that normally ends in gun fire and a trip to the morgue. It has superb voice acting and story. I liked this game so much I spent months kicking down doors and shouting, ""L.A.P.D.!"" at the top of my lungs and scaring the crap out of everyone. So, point fingers (sometimes) and take names (literally) in this noir-ey detective game.			",104,25,1,8,13,3,2

												L.A. Noire is a fantastic game, and you owe it to yourself to play it... on a console. The PC port is inconsistent and just not worth the hassle if you have this alternative. Hurts my soul to see so many unable to play it. I haven't exactly had any catastrophic issues (unlike others), but I have had to put up with brief launching issues, getting stuck on the title screen, no Cloud support, configuration only on startup, and some slight stuttering even though I exceed the recommended requirements (it wasn't always like that so I'm sure it's fixable, but I haven't tried yet).It's also probably better to play with a controller, partly due to the vibration function making searching for clues (which you do often) easier.Apart from all that... game's damn near a masterpiece. But it's probably best to find it for cheap on a console for a smooth experience. About two hours of my recorded playtime are probably made up of trying to get it to work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ofcourse, you see them, they are standing there, their hand is there, dangling around the corner, map shows the big dot of your assailant, but you can't do anything, you just need to pass and be hit like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moron...Car driving is also pretty dull... All cars feel pretty much the same, and, given the time period, are pretty slow, but that is understandable...And, the most awful thing is actually trying to follow someone... Be it either on foot or in the car... You just need to be extremely slow, and if they catch you, do it all over again... Ok, that is the point of following, but THAT IS NOT FUN! And this is the game, and if you really need to do it, don't do it 100 times... It's boring...So, when you think that questioning system is nice... It is, really, not... Whenever someone answers your question, you must either say that they are telling the truth, you can doubt their answer or tell that they are lying (in which case you must have the evidence)... In the first half, you can easily tell when someone is not telling the truth, so just doubt it, if you have no evidence... But near the end of the game, there are some questions, when you just can't tell if someone is telling the truth, and you don't have evidence for lying... So... good luck, 50/50 doubt or truth... Well, ok, it's not supposed to be easy, far from that, but I want it to be as near to perfect as possible, and you cannot load conversation again... :/ This is not so important and bad as those problems mentioned above, but could've been better...But... As the title said... Why I LOVE this awful game...Although whole game is really bad in terms of almost any game mechanics... It is one fantastic interactive movie... Voice acting is great, facial expressions are fantastic and story just feels real almost all the time... Especially when you reach the Arson department, when things start to unroll...Characters also feel real, and I really started to understand their motivations, fears and emotions... From that point of view, this game is amazing...So, TLDR; This game should have been a movie... It is an awful game experience, with absolutely amazing actors and story writers... I will recommend it just for that, because when I finished it, I really wanted to ""play"" it again and see all the characters, their stories and ends...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Замечательная игра. , Достаточно однотипный игровой процесс делают своё дело и где-то после половины игры начинаешь ощущать скуку, игра начинает надоедать. У меня было желание забросить прохождение игры. Но к счастью я этого не сделал и не пожалел: сюжет начал колбаситься из стороны в сторону увлекая меня за собой.  В общем, если вам игра понравилась изначально, не бросайте прохождение на середине - обязательной пройдите её до конца.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Never do you play a game that has no clones, or at least not as good as it. That game is L.A. Noire.Lets look at the Pros, Mixed, and Cons.+ Very fun gameplay. I want to let you know that this game IS a puzzle game, but not as you might expect. You have to find certain clues, not doing any stupid pushing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's very fun and addictive, and wants me to have more of it. Also, there is some shooting and driving involved. However, if you wanted this to be a GTA in 1940, then you will be disappointed. However, you should love it, even if puzzles are not your thing.+ The Sound if FANTASTIC. If I had to rate this game on Sound, it would be a 10.5/10. It's that DAMN GOOD. The soundtrack is great and so 1940s! In fact, I noticed a lot of music from Fallout 3 in here, which also has awesome music. The voice acting is also perfect. It sounded like it could have been real detectives.+ The graphics are pretty dang sweet. The character models, especially their faces, are great. I never noticed bad lip-syncing, unlike most other games. I know there is one issue invloving graphics, but I will later address that in the review.+ A long story. It took me around 24 hours to beat L.A. Noire, and I was not rushing. It's fantastic well it lasts. However, well it lasts.+ Side Missions. They are not that good, but not bad either. It is nice that they added this, so this will not go against the review.Mixed:- 30 FPS capped. This would be a huge con IF it were not for a damn good explanation. So, this game was originally a console game, just like Red Dead Redemption (By the way rockstar, add it onto Steam. I don't care that it's almost 5 years old, I really want to play it) As we know, a lot of console games are locked at 30 FPS (Destiny, Fallout 4, etc.) However, Rockstar noticed there was a huge problem. The lip-syncing on PC was not good at all. They had a total of 4 choices: 1. Let there be bad lip-syncing, removing points from the PC review. 2. Redo THE ENTIRE GAME FOR PC, which could have taken a long time. 3. Make the gameplay 60 FPS, but the faces 30 FPS, possibly making bad lag, as well as confusing most people. 4. Keep it the same, but face there will be only be regular players who will outrage. I think 4 was the safest bet, plus it does not run that bad. At 30 FPS, it is fantastic. However, I still wish there was at least an option.Cons:- The gameplay gets boring a bit fast. After the 30th time of having a shoot out, it gets tiring. However, only the shooting. The interviews and car driving never get old.- This game has glitches, which might not seem bad, until I tell you. Screen-tearing, graphical glitches, and more are only uncommon, not rare.- Very little replay value. There is no second route, like GTA, Fallout, or Elder Scrolls. The next time you play it, it will be the same, which makes it boring. However, there is DLC if you can not get enough, which you would have to be crazy to not be.FINAL VERDICT9/10 L.A. Noire is a fantastic game.At full price it is worth it. On sale, you would have to be crazy not to buy it. I love this game and am praying that Rockstar will make a sequel, improving the games flaws.

Unlock dozens of classic automobiles. Prevent crimes in progress. Search for clues at crime scenes and interrogate witnesses. Combines the open world fun of GTA with the mandatory requirement of using your brain to solve crimes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lie Detector: The Video GameStory: 23/25 Gameplay: 20/25 Graphics: 24/25 Sound: 21/25OVERALL: 88/100Well, you're a cop. That's new for this type of game. The story was pretty awesome with a lot of twists I didn't expect. It also shows pretty well how corrupt the police were at that time and how even the best men can do bad things. The gameplay was rather enjoyable. Running, gunning, following traffic laws until you get bored and decide to just drive on the sidewalk even though there's people there. Good stuff. The main thing that sets this title apart is the interrogations where you have to decide whether or nor people are lying. This is really, really, really awful at times. The graphics are amazing and everything appears to be from the proper time period. The sound is equally as good except I notice some reverberation or muffling with some of the voice acting. Awesome game, get it and its DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't even think to compare this game to GTA-series. It's very different from some stpd thug-simulator like Watch_Dogs or GTA.Playing this game requires you to roleplay a detective of LAPD. Game is very immersive. City outside the buildings is vivid and alive. Graphics and sounds are very good.Act like a restless and proud detective. Drive retro cars carefully, stop at traffic lights if not in a hurry, embrace the atmosphere of 40's, listen to some flavor music while driving to settle your mind boiling with clues and suspects from current case. Interogate victims and suspects, look carefully and gather clues at crime scenes, don't get shot in firefights and get upperhand at HtH brawls.Take your part in ongoing plot.Interogation logic could'be weird at times, but doesn't break immersion or plot. Cases could be solved faster if you ask right questions and find important evidence upfront. This promotes replayability of the game.Verdict: This game is incredible if played right! Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty good.  I don't finish many single-player games as I am easily bored, but I finished this one.  The storey keeps you hooked.  It's well worth the cheap price you can get it for these days.  I payed a lot more.The driving sections are worth it only to hear the banter between the cops.  You can skip them afterwards (although you can find side-missions if you don't).  The city looks nice, but it is largely just for show (you can't interact with much).  The facial motion-capture and acting is the best I have ever seen in a game.  In fact, it's so good that it makes the rest of the character models and environmental graphics look stragely aweful (but they aren't really thad bad!).If you're reading this, I'd suggest you buy it.

												L.A. Noire is the most darkest time periods in gaming history. I love the facial animations put into the game and the great story with some jokes as well as investgating, shootouts, and interriogation. Interriogation is proboaly my favorite thing about this game, sure the game is nothing like ""Grand Theft Auto"" from Rockstar but the team did do a great job and mastering this game. But they are some problems with lag with people whos PCs are more than perfect to play on but has a bad PC port but if you have a good PC, like me, than trust me this will be worth your money just for the story and interrogations alone.

												It's a quite interesting game with some unique gameplay mechanics and excellent facial animations, but...It is somewhat let down by horrible driving controls that are extremely over sensitive and the cars handle like tanks. All the movements in general have a really weighty, clunky feel to them, and there are many times when performing simple actions, such as climbing over a wall during a chase fail because you initiate it at slightly the wrong angle. Quite frustrating and difficult to get used to.The investigation mechanics are the only thing the game really has going for it, and they are great, but I can't help have the feeling that the game would have been a LOT stronger overall if it focused more on that side of things than on crappy gunplay and drawn out driving sequences.Probably the most irritating thing is that cut scenes are unskippable...So if you restart a case, you have to sit through all of the dialogue, then drive back to the crime scene etc....This is bad in any game, but in a game that relies heavily on story exposition it is pretty unforgivable.It does have an interesting story as well. Probably worth picking up in a sale if you are interested in the premise, but don't expect an action game, or rewarding gunplay, or enjoyable driving experiences.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A Noire is a game about Detective Cole Phelps. It's a game based around solving crimes and arresting (or in most cases, murdering in cold blood) suspects. The game is supposed to be like a real old movie, and it has the framerate to match. Seriously, this game is one of the worst ports I've ever seen. At least Max Payne and GTA 4 worked and kept above half a frame.  I've spent more time trying to fix the bloody FPS then actually playing the thing. I really, REALLY want to recommend this game, but I just can't. Rockstar just doesn't care about PC users. They just care about maximizing profits by giving us the scraps. Games like GTA 4 or L.A Noire are shadows of their console versions. We can't keep letting Rockstar push us around like this. They throw us a bugged, poorly optimized game and then never fix it, despite having all the time in the world to. How come companies like Valve and *shudders* EA can make good PC ports, but Rockstar can't? Because Rockstar is lazy. They're lazy, and they don't care about PC gamers. They make us wait months, sometimes a year or more, for a fantastic game, and they make it unplayable. Rockstar can't keep getting away with this, they just can't. When i was a console gamer, I thought that Rockstar was the best company ever, and that they actually cared about their gamers, but after playing their games on PC, i know that i was mistaken. All in all, L.A Noire would be good, if Rockstar cared enough to put any effort into optimizing it for PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Once more a rockstar game that teaches people that crime pays.  The game has good mechanisms but, as seems to mostly be the case with rockstar games, the story writers have the main character take decisions, for narrative purposes that you as player if left free to choose would not.  That, to me, is the failure of LA Noire, it makes it so that you at one point stop caring about the story told and just finish the game to say that you have done so.I frankly expected more from the game from the reviews I read.

												Fantastic detective game with a very enjoyable story, characters that are interesting, some of the best facial animations yet, a wonderful creation of old school LA and the detective gameplay is a TON of fun. The game is not as open world as say GTA or Watch Dogs, but it goes for story alot more and also has the great detective work, looking for clues, interviewing people about crimes and trying to figure out if they are lying or telling the truth. If you want more story/character driven game pick this up, more linear than most open world games but the fantastic detecitve work, story, characters and animations are top notch. The game is capped at 30fps because of the facial animations they use, which might annoy some people, but once you play you will see it is not a big deal. Didn't have any crashes in the game and no big game breaking bugs. Not perfect but overall I had a blast on this game the two times I beat it. Not the best graphics ever but as I said the animations are fantastic and most everything else is well done.Looking for a fun detective game? Pick this up asap!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is unique, with an incredible 40's atmosphere, and what better place for this game than L.A.? Everything is in harmony in this game, the setting, the people, the music, it all fits together with a good and intriguing story, solving cases, chasing down thugs, investigating clues. All of these things contribute to make this game what it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought L.A. Noire today, this game is fantastic, I played it on Xbox a few years ago and now I wanted to experience it on PC. Only problem is the RockStar Game Auto-Updater will not connect to its servers and then when I select Offline Mode it never stops Synchronizing so I cannot play the game!! My PC can run this game no problem either and I have a good internet connection so it has nothing to do with me. RockStar needs to get their **** together because I paid money for a game that should work no problem and the game cannot even connect to their serves... Shame because this is a very good game...if you can get it to work that is...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game in very well made and at times a blast to play. However in the game there are sequences, mostly towards the end, that just go on and on and really took me out of the experience. Most of them feel as if they were made to prolong the story play time since they slow down the progression of the story. If it werent for this i would be recomending this game since it is in all other respects a stellar video game, it is just these sequences complety broke the experience for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I do think the game is very good, the technical support is just beyond bad, almost to the point where Rockstar is slapping their customers with a sign that says ""We dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. The fact that PC Brothers (thank you!) had to make their own fix for the recent problems with LA Noir (because Rockstar doesnt seem to pay any attention to this game) should be a big eye-opener for anyone deciding to buy this game.It is very unfortunate that a good game like this is plagued by technical issues and a support staff that doesn't reach out to its customers.

												The concept of the game is a good one. The story and type of gameplay could have been good (although i'm pretty sure I would make a terrible police investigator)BUT, the game itself is terrible. There is a terrible problem with framerate, and the fixes provided by the community (not the developers) don't always work. Many levels of the game are buggy and impossible to pass, specifically those that involve ""grappling"".The fact that there are so many problems is very annoying because without them it would be a very good game. But as it stands, you should not bother getting this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BAIT AND SWITCH!When I bought this game, it didn't require me to surrender all of my personal details to create a rockstar account (which offers no benefits, btw).  Now, in order to play the game I already paid $60 for, I need to create an account.  Since this wasn't necessary when I bought the game, this is clearly an example of bait & switch, which is illegal in the US.Despite the fact that rockstar changed the requirements after the fact, Steam seems perfectly happy allowing rockstar to continue to ♥♥♥♥ over their customers with shoddy ports that require EVEN MORE telemmetry than their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console counterparts.tl;dr: The game I purchased for $60 is no longer playable unless I surrender my personal details, which was not part of the original deal.  Steam has utterly failed to give a ♥♥♥♥, telling me I need to deal with rockstar, because they won't provide a refund on a product whose terms of use apparently changed without me being notified.  This is an extremely underhanded business practice, and we shouldn't be putting up with it.  NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM ROCKSTAR!!!!!!  Once they have your money, they'll see fit to steal the product back from you, and Steam will do NOTHING.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a letter to my younger self.Why did you not buy this game?  You thought because it was in olden times it'd suck?  You are despicable!  KILL YOURSELF.  Not that we got that out of the way, this game is AMAZING.  It's so much fun to play as a cop in the 1940's.  It feels right... so right.  It's such a long game, I mean the campaign took me over 20 hours to complete.  It has some parts that aren't that fun but oooohhh, such good times.  They need to make another game like this, either in present times or in olden times again.  There are so many cop shows these days, we need more cop games!  Tired of GTA and all that, played way too much of that, I just want to be a cop.  Please Rockstar, I hope you're working on a police game or something like that.  I really hope you are!

Edit: After the Patch released on 8/6/2015 The Game Lauches and runs faily well.

												This is an openworld/sandbox game, but instead of being the bad guy, like in GTA or Saints Row, you are a cop working your way up on the police department. I'm enjoying the gameplay, only find it's a litle bit hard to drive and keep control of the car. But it's nothing that keeps you from playing the game, you just have to get used to the driving. I'm really enjoying the story and the cases. You get to interrogate suspects and examine crime scenes to find clues. Really cool game! In my opinion this game is worth buying, especially if you enjoy openworld/sandbox type games. I strongly recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never actually made a proper review for this:The storyline:Brilliant, just brilliant, one of the best storyline based games I've ever played, it's the first that I've been able to replay more than once without being bored at all. It keeps you enthralled in it at every turn, even letting you learn a bit more about Phelps' past in the war. And, if you wanted to take a break from the story, you can drive around town responding to ""normal"" police calls such as bank robberies, things that aren't detective work, you can also search for rare cars and learn more about the landmarks of Los Angeles in the 1940/50's.The mechanics (Questioning, clue finding): I must say the questioning part of this game is very fun, and the achievement for 100% correct answers is very difficult without a guide, I almost had it and near to the end I screwed up a question and it's safe to say I wasn't very happy at all with myself. The clue finding is fun as well, in some cases it's a bit boring, but with most cases I've found that there's difficulty finding some clues but once you've played the game through at least once, you can remember some of the spots where clues are left.The length: A perfect size in my opinion, it's lengthy but not so lengthy it's ridiculous.Overall rating: 10/10By far one of THE best games I have ever played, I would recommend this to anybody.

												This has got to be one of my favorite games of all time.  The story about Cole and his experiences really drew me into his life and made me care about his character.  The crime scenes are very fun to search around and look for clues, although when you're stumped it can be frustrating at times you can save up intuition to help you out.  The action sequences are very intense and can be challenging at times.  They do offer to allow you to skip them if you're having difficulty but where's the fun in that!  The interrogations are the hardest part of the game for me.  It takes a while to see how the different characters will react and lie to you.  The game is really long but I enjoyed every moment of it.  If you love crime/detective shows this game is a must buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, what is Rockstar known for right now? Well basically a game where 9 year olds run around screaming N***ER and other curses, and using their in-game currency to jet blow-jobs from hookers.Their also known for, ""AYY NICO LES GO BOWLING.""Now, let's think of some other really good games of rockstar, such as Bully Scholarship, and GTA San Andreas and more.But one in particular, L.A. Noire, oh boy are you in for a treat. I didn't enjoy detective games as much as I did before playing this game, I bet even if you hate detective games, you will LOVE this game.I can only think of pros, like no cons AT ALL! - Car Driving is amazing- Great gameplay features and objectives- Good shooter- Stunning graphics- And it lasts you more than 20 hours, and you prob will wanna come back to it and replay it.PLEASE GET IT, STOP LOOKING AT THE OTHER REVIEWS.

L.A. Noire is a nice and pure detective game. A must play for any fan of the genre.The place and setting is charming and beautiful, but also dark where you wouldn't look - which is just perfect. The story is great, and every mission feels different and unique.What's most fascinating is the mechanic where you read peoples facial expressions to tell whether they're telling the truth or not. That; together with the clues you find, and the small details you take notice of, and through a careful method of interrogation - makes you able to find the persons that are responsible for the crimes that has taken place.

												This game is a must for anyone that likes crime drama or detective noir. This is not GTA. GTA is more like Saints Row which are both great games but not much like this game. LA Noire is more like Mafia or Hard Rain set in the post WW2 era but it plays more like a movie. So the equation: ((HR x 2) + M) may be a start.What the game lacks in action it makes up for in story. It will draw you in -I played it straight through which is unusual for me. While solving the main story mystery there are mini-games/crimes that will show up. Some of the mini crimes tie into the main storyline but are not essential. They are great if you feel the need for some action. There are also cars, badges and film reels scattered about that you can collect in a Free Roam Mode.The only issue I had was the 30FPS cap on the game which can make the game seem choppy at times but it doesn't ruin the game. This is a great game and I am looking foward to the next installment. I recommend buying all the DLC with this game before you play since it adds so much to the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, it's been almost 4 years since the original release and I'm like derp time to play it now! It's still a super good game. That said I find it strange that I get into so many gun fights, I've got a body count a mile long isn't that BAD for police officers? I try to tackle guys and auto die for getting close it seems... Also SPOILERS but I had to laugh when my partner in homicide started shooting all the hobos I was like DAMN only in the 1940s could you just show up at a camp full of homeless people and start shooting them point blank with a shotgun... lol.

Quickly :  Score 18/20   Gameplay 16/20   Lifespan 17/20   Scenario 19/20   Soundtrack 19/20   Graphics 18/20  Score isn't the mathematical average, but more of a general appreciation mark for the gameExtra blabla :One of the best 50's LA ambience evah !  The Questioning sequences thanks to the motion capture technology, are pretty crazy and are hella funny, main prob with the game, being the massive absence of challenge... Clearly there's none, shooting-wise and when it comes to the clues, well that's another thing. To get an optimal and fully satisfying experience i'd recommend disabling the audio/visual hints for the clues.Characters are good . Investigations are credible. Content is generous.An excellent game, that stands out with its investigation mechanics .Buy !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not as varied or as modern as Naughty Dog's 'Last of us', but the audio, graphics, story , gameplay and complexity of Rockstar Games L.A. Noire is still one of the best for this genre and I've no idea why David Cage after all these years, still hasn't learned how to make a decent and believable game []o_O]Despite being a poorly ported to Steam for Windows OS and being over two years old, it still sounds and looks far better than any current XB1 or PS4 ...thing. The games atmosphere drips film noire with authenticity to match and some brilliant acting/voice overs, which all make it truly feel like L.A. Confidential the video game {}^_^}Naughty Dog (much like Psygnosis was) is pretty much Sony's ♥♥♥♥♥ now, so we won't be getting of there fine work (though limited to 720p/30fps), so for us Steam for Windows OS only users, L.A. Noire is outstanding and highly recommend alternative []^_^]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was utterly fantastic at immersing you into the atmosphere of the late 1940's.  Hats off to the developers.  The detective work was fun, but It sort of had its own subtle way of holding your hand, ex. sound cues, a limited amount of hints, giving you the option to skip a sequence if it becomes troubling to you, etc.  However, these things can be turned off in the options menu, giving the hardcore detective wanna-bes no conflict.My single playthrough gave me nearly 30 hours of content, including the dlcs.  I did every side mission (street crimes), but didn't obtain the entire exploration extras; real life landmarks, hidden badges and film reels, and collecting the cars from the time.  I gotta tell you, after finding the hidden vintage cars...That was some serious eye-candy.  If you are into restoration or you are a vintage collector you will probably turn ecstatic.The gameplay was okay but nothing really specialThe graphics were nice, but had the occasional texture pop-ins. Last, but not least, the realistic character face imagery was awesome.  The purpose was using it to decide whether a person was lying or telling the truth.  Some of the reactions were hilariously overblown and gave an obvious sign of deceit, giving the game more of a ""helping hand"".If you like this period or like detective games, I say make the purchase.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.			",116,16,3,12,6,1,14

												Rockstar has once again made another excellent game.   1940's Los Angeles is the setting in this Detective game that resembles the GTA Series.  Great Graphics and Gameplay.  Ignore the DRM since it is non intrusive, ignore the complaints about fps and graphics, I have no problems running this game at all with a new system.  Game requires more thinking skills than shooting/action.  Facial animations are top notch.  Graphics are true to giving us a realistic 1940 LA Time Period.  This is a highly recommended game!

												We consider L.A. Noire an excellent game that will please the vast majority of players. But be aware that L.A. Noire is mostly an investigative game and for this reason does not have as much action as some players would like it to have. If you are looking for lots of action and shooting in the 40s, L.A. Noire is not the game that you seek. However, if you are in the mood to spend hours looking for objects, analyzing, interrogating suspects and victims and occasionally take part in shootings or car chases, congratulations, you have won the jackpot.

												This game is freaking great. You take control of a paranoid schizophrenic patient who believes he's a detective in the 1950's. The entire game is a lie, and the people that you ""kill"" in-game are just hallucinations, as you actually are running around downtown L.A. like an absolute madman in ""real life"". I feel bad because there's this one part where you need to kill a little girl to obtain the secret information from the FBI overlords, and if you think that she's ""lying"" about her story, you kill her and take her papers. The reality in that is that you kill her in real life, and then take her kindergarten schoolwork. It's a twisted game that will leave your computer full of kum when you're done with it.

Get the complete edition because the DLC cases tie in with the story well and you don't want to miss out. Rockstar really did their research for this game.

												What an Incredible game! One of the deepest and richest storylines for any game I have every played. Not only do you feel good after solving a crime, but you actually feel like you are in the game with Cole Phelps and his partner. The searching of evidence is extremely easy with music and sound effects making almost impossible to miss a clue, but remember, not every clue is necesasary to the case! The driving is absolute perfection but I felt that at times, the car felt terrible for how far in the story you were (not a spoiler). I feel once you progress further, the car you drive should get better. The action mechanics are awesome, chasing down a baddy and tackling him to the ground is a satisfying thing. Though the shooting mechanics of the game take time to adjust to and some enemies take at least a full magazine of ammo to kill if it is not a headshot, it is easy to adjust to. The interview process of the game is extremely detailed, where a simple swallowing of saliva, could show the persons doubt. Make sure you look at your notebook and check every piece of evidence to make sure the accused isnt lying. This game has some small flaws, but are easily overlooked and one of the best police/detective games ever! 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire took me really long to complete with all the DLC, around 40 hours and it was hell of a run. This game was filled with amazing detective based mystery cases and a very distinct story line.The action was fun and amusing, chasing down people on foot and inside the vehicles. The gun action was also basic and easy to understand , from taking cover to blind firing your ememies or even just straight ramboing it.Taking the vehicles back to 1940's was a very neat idea, driving old cars was fun for a change wrather than the ones in the GTA series. They are over 90 vehicles and I only found half of them.The map is huge and there's just so much to explore.The main factor of the game is the motion capture of the face, the facial expressions were probably the most detailed and realistic I've ever seen in a game. When it comes to asking questions, i'm sure many people will get stumped or unsure on either choosing the ""truth"", ""doubt"" or a ""lie""I will give this game 9/10 just because the ending wasn't how I wanted it to end.

What it is aboutL.A. Noire is an action-adventure crime game played from a third-person perspective. There are cases to be completed, such as investigations for murder, to progress through the story. Inbetween all the cases, the player can roam in the 1940's Los Angeles to complete in optional activities, which appear through the police radio. Combined together, one can spend many hours to complete the game.The game is known for MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. This technology is one of the important things in the game, as you have to guess if the witnesses you are interrogating are lying or telling the truth.L.A. Noire is capped to 30 frames per second (MotionScan is the reason for this), and the graphics, for a game being released in 2011, look kinda plastic and lifeless (applied to objects that are not alive). MotionScan does make the game feel a little alive, although nowaday's techniques let MotionScan stand in the corner for being the Ugly Betty.The available DLC expands the base game for a few more missions, giving it a little more time to survive the time you are playing it :-)In a nutshellL.A. Noire definitely set a new level for reality in 2011. Being beautiful, brutal, difficult and action-packed in one, this game is a must-play for every player that likes AAA-titles from previous years and for players searching for a temporary addiction!

												Rockstar has once again made another excellent game.   1940's Los Angeles is the setting in this Detective game that resembles the GTA Series.  Great Graphics and Gameplay.  Ignore the DRM since it is non intrusive, ignore the complaints about fps and graphics, I have no problems running this game at all with a new system.  Game requires more thinking skills than shooting/action.  Facial animations are top notch.  Graphics are true to giving us a realistic 1940 LA Time Period.  This is a highly recommended game!

The Questioning sequences thanks to the motion capture technology, are pretty crazy and are hella funny, main prob with the game, being the massive absence of challenge... Clearly there's none, shooting-wise and when it comes to the clues, well that's another thing. To get an optimal and fully satisfying experience i'd recommend disabling the audio/visual hints for the clues.Characters are good . Investigations are credible.

												This game is freaking great. You take control of a paranoid schizophrenic patient who believes he's a detective in the 1950's. The entire game is a lie, and the people that you ""kill"" in-game are just hallucinations, as you actually are running around downtown L.A. like an absolute madman in ""real life"". I feel bad because there's this one part where you need to kill a little girl to obtain the secret information from the FBI overlords, and if you think that she's ""lying"" about her story, you kill her and take her papers. The reality in that is that you kill her in real life, and then take her kindergarten schoolwork. It's a twisted game that will leave your computer full of kum when you're done with it.

												This game is a must for anyone that likes crime drama or detective noir. This is not GTA. GTA is more like Saints Row which are both great games but not much like this game. LA Noire is more like Mafia or Hard Rain set in the post WW2 era but it plays more like a movie. So the equation: ((HR x 2) + M) may be a start.What the game lacks in action it makes up for in story. It will draw you in -I played it straight through which is unusual for me. While solving the main story mystery there are mini-games/crimes that will show up. Some of the mini crimes tie into the main storyline but are not essential. They are great if you feel the need for some action. There are also cars, badges and film reels scattered about that you can collect in a Free Roam Mode.The only issue I had was the 30FPS cap on the game which can make the game seem choppy at times but it doesn't ruin the game. This is a great game and I am looking foward to the next installment. I recommend buying all the DLC with this game before you play since it adds so much to the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've only played through the first campaign and that's a story in itself.  It is a cinematic game akin to Mafia 2 which was an incredible experience.  The fault of this game is the confusing interrogation of the suspects and witnesses.  The whole lie/truth/neutral stance really makes no sense to me whatsoever because whatever I click, Cole's response is never what I expect him to say.  If I knew what he was going to say before I click it would feel so much better and probably give me more correct run throughs.  I also failed to pay attention to some of the characters from the larger story arc but that's my fault so the story campaign was a little confusing.On the bright side, the shooting and fight mechanics are awesome.  Driving around LA is great fun.  The world looks and sounds brilliant though it does run a little slow on my computer.  The dialogue and character interactions are top notch with excellent voice acting.  The facial expressions are a shining highlight and it makes those interrogations special even if I don't choose the correct option.  Don't get too wrapped up in the interrogations, maybe it's all my fault, but the rest of the game is good enough, especially for 5 bucks on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I fully recommend this game, for those who like crime-solving games, games with mystery or suspense, or for those who enjoy the '50s noire detective/gangster theme. I myself enjoy all three of these elements, and so find this game incredibly addictive and enjoyable. The game is designed so that mistakes can be made during clue collecting (ie, you miss a clue) and interrogation (ie, you fail to call out a witness on a lie, or accept a lie as the truth) without a failure-state; it simply makes it more difficult to come to the correct conclusion at the end of the case, or it leads to a decreased score on the case. Each case has a very powerful film noire feel, and the cases are often based on historical cases from the 50s. You play Detective Phelps, an WW2 veteran who has turned to detective work for the LA police, and you interact with diverse, interesting characters, all with great voice acting and motion capture. To sum it up, there's not really any other game like this one, so if it appeals to you, get it! If you get it today, it's on sale for 4.99, but if you get the complete edition for an extra 10 cents, it comes with a couple extra cases and other DLC. What a steal!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very interesting game for crime-story enthusiastics. Background plot doesn't have as much into it as I expected, but some of the cases in the game are excellent. Some of the downsides in the game include the fact that in order to get into 5-star performance, you will have to go over all the witnesses and locations and find sufficient amount of clues provided. This is very annoying as some of the witnesses aren't helpful to the cases and will not provide anything needed to solve the case in all of its components.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm surprised at the relatively low scores here. I think this game is fantastic. It is what Mafia II was supposed to be on the storytelling/narration front. I'm normally very sensitive to shoddy ports, but this port doesn't seem to have consolitis at all in my opinion. I never played the console version so I can't compare. It certainly seems to control better than, say, Dead Space 1 or 2 did on the PC. The acting, story, and facial animations are world-class, and the facial animations really do raise the emotion of the scenes...you can see people's Adam's apples move when they gulp, for crying out loud! Doesn't sound very important except when you consider that much of what you're doing in the game is trying to find out if people are lying or not. I would say this is a GOTY contender if it weren't for the fact that Arkham City is about to come out, which I assume will dominate. My only gripe is that the cars handle way too well for cars of that era. They're very 'sticky'. It has worked perfectly 'out of the box' for me (purchased on Steam), no stability issues at all, except the game crashes whenever I quit. Obviously that is a non-issue, doesn't affect the experience at all because it only happens when I quit. I also don't have any of the frame-rate issues that some are reporting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

L.A. Noire is a nice and pure detective game. A must play for any fan of the genre.The place and setting is charming and beautiful, but also dark where you wouldn't look - which is just perfect. The story is great, and every mission feels different and unique.What's most fascinating is the mechanic where you read peoples facial expressions to tell whether they're telling the truth or not. That; together with the clues you find, and the small details you take notice of, and through a careful method of interrogation - makes you able to find the persons that are responsible for the crimes that has taken place.

The only thing I hated was that it only runs at 30fps due to the lip syncing. For some reason the lip syncing wouldn't be possible at 60fps therefore locking the game at 30. But if it doesn't bother you then you will have a blast with it none the less. Would recommend playing with a controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is definitely a very much under rated game. Got it a while back and it was sitting in my library until i decided to give it a shot. Fantastic gameplay and storyline and the ability to play detective is unheard of. Hopefully rockstar would come out with a part II for this game....Sure rocks big time....one of the hidden gem around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was suprised at how well the investigation gameplay works.  It's challenging, and probably the most complex conversation I've seen in a game.Definitely haven't seen one where the character you're interrogating can get agitated while you peruse your notebook looking for the right peice of evidence to accuse them of a lie with...Recommend for peoples who fancy themselves a good detective story.

												Rockstar has once again made another excellent game.   1940's Los Angeles is the setting in this Detective game that resembles the GTA Series.  Great Graphics and Gameplay.  Ignore the DRM since it is non intrusive, ignore the complaints about fps and graphics, I have no problems running this game at all with a new system.  Game requires more thinking skills than shooting/action.  Facial animations are top notch.  Graphics are true to giving us a realistic 1940 LA Time Period.  This is a highly recommended game!

Quickly :  Score 18/20   Gameplay 16/20   Lifespan 17/20   Scenario 19/20   Soundtrack 19/20   Graphics 18/20  Score isn't the mathematical average, but more of a general appreciation mark for the gameExtra blabla :One of the best 50's LA ambience evah !  The Questioning sequences thanks to the motion capture technology, are pretty crazy and are hella funny, main prob with the game, being the massive absence of challenge... Clearly there's none, shooting-wise and when it comes to the clues, well that's another thing. To get an optimal and fully satisfying experience i'd recommend disabling the audio/visual hints for the clues.Characters are good . Investigations are credible. Content is generous.An excellent game, that stands out with its investigation mechanics .Buy !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is freaking great. You take control of a paranoid schizophrenic patient who believes he's a detective in the 1950's. The entire game is a lie, and the people that you ""kill"" in-game are just hallucinations, as you actually are running around downtown L.A. like an absolute madman in ""real life"". I feel bad because there's this one part where you need to kill a little girl to obtain the secret information from the FBI overlords, and if you think that she's ""lying"" about her story, you kill her and take her papers. The reality in that is that you kill her in real life, and then take her kindergarten schoolwork. It's a twisted game that will leave your computer full of kum when you're done with it.

												I remember when my friend first recommended this game for; I was new to gaming, but I had a few inevitable chores to take care of. By the time I finished my chores and dropped my mom off at her local gym for her to prepare for her soon to be successful weight loss program; I decided to play this critically acclaimed contemporary ""masterpiece"" that the reviewers laud.When I reached about 5-6 hours in the game, I discovered a plethora of flaws about this poorly designed hype creator.No storyline: Where does the storyline lieBad characters: Bad charactersLack of entertainment: Lack of entertainmentPros: My friend recommended this game to meThis game is truly a disaster. I am going to drive back to the gym and help my mom with her weight loss program. She started off at 255 pounds and now she is down 60 pounds. After she finishes her diet, she will start bodybuilding. Although, I do not find women who bodybuild attractive, but because she is my mom, it is ok.9.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire took me really long to complete with all the DLC, around 40 hours and it was hell of a run. This game was filled with amazing detective based mystery cases and a very distinct story line.The action was fun and amusing, chasing down people on foot and inside the vehicles. The gun action was also basic and easy to understand , from taking cover to blind firing your ememies or even just straight ramboing it.Taking the vehicles back to 1940's was a very neat idea, driving old cars was fun for a change wrather than the ones in the GTA series. They are over 90 vehicles and I only found half of them.The map is huge and there's just so much to explore.The main factor of the game is the motion capture of the face, the facial expressions were probably the most detailed and realistic I've ever seen in a game. When it comes to asking questions, i'm sure many people will get stumped or unsure on either choosing the ""truth"", ""doubt"" or a ""lie""I will give this game 9/10 just because the ending wasn't how I wanted it to end.

												While visually impeccable, the game plays like your favourite 50s detective flick (I'm looking at L.A Condfidential.) There may be a few performance issues (it is a port) but nothing game breaking.The story is superb (mostly) and there are a few plot twists that one would never have seen coming. The shooting is as basic as you can get but feels very refreshing from GTA or Call of Duty. People go down in 1-3 hits, like they should. Driving is a little 'iffy' and the cars a sometimes hard to handle; you'll find yourself crashing quite a bit. L.A Noire is flawless in most ways (gameplay and storywise), and I'm about to enter my 4th playthrough. While there is not really 'free roam' (there is, but it's only to replay the emergency calls you get in the story) the 15+ hours of story and interrogations should keep you perfectly entertained. I still don't get how they did the faces, they look amazing. For £4.99 on sale, you are duty bound to get this and play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

L.A. Noire is a nice and pure detective game. A must play for any fan of the genre.The place and setting is charming and beautiful, but also dark where you wouldn't look - which is just perfect. The story is great, and every mission feels different and unique.What's most fascinating is the mechanic where you read peoples facial expressions to tell whether they're telling the truth or not. That; together with the clues you find, and the small details you take notice of, and through a careful method of interrogation - makes you able to find the persons that are responsible for the crimes that has taken place.

												This game is a must for anyone that likes crime drama or detective noir. This is not GTA. GTA is more like Saints Row which are both great games but not much like this game. LA Noire is more like Mafia or Hard Rain set in the post WW2 era but it plays more like a movie. So the equation: ((HR x 2) + M) may be a start.What the game lacks in action it makes up for in story. It will draw you in -I played it straight through which is unusual for me. While solving the main story mystery there are mini-games/crimes that will show up. Some of the mini crimes tie into the main storyline but are not essential. They are great if you feel the need for some action. There are also cars, badges and film reels scattered about that you can collect in a Free Roam Mode.The only issue I had was the 30FPS cap on the game which can make the game seem choppy at times but it doesn't ruin the game. This is a great game and I am looking foward to the next installment. I recommend buying all the DLC with this game before you play since it adds so much to the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is reminiscent of a lot of us. We’re decent people sure, but we’ve become bloated with wasted potential. Maybe I should go ahead and compare Noire to a high-end escort. Sure, her parents are disappointed but she’s certainly bringing something different and enjoyable to your evening. You should definitely play L.A. Noire but like me you may walk away feeling that it could have been much more. There are also a slew of problems both technical and performance but the experience is fresh, invigorating, and will keep you playing through the night.L.A. Noire is heavily influenced by film noire. If you despise that genre maybe this game isn’t for you. The story is smothered in a thick layer of atmosphere with character personalities practically picked from the classics. Sure, some of the characters are definitely cliché but this plays to the games benefit. It’s supposed to be reminiscent of film noire and it does a damn good job at it. I won’t go too much into the characters or story because that’s something players should experience firsthand for themselves. It’s good and you should play it. The story can be described as paced and methodical. Unlike other Rockstar titles you won’t be blowing through waves of armed baddies every moment of the day. You’ll play as Cole Phelps, a veteran of World War II turned by-the-book detective in late 1940s Los Angeles. Because you’re a detective you’ll spend less time in shootouts and more time investigating crimes, interviewing suspects, and driving around in style. The investigations continue to introduce diversity in their story and characters but the central process generally stays the same. You’ll interrogate witnesses, chase down suspects, and sort through crime scenes for clues. The most prominent game mechanic is of course the interrogation mechanic in whom you judge whether your witness/suspect you believe the person you are interrogating is telling the truth, you doubt them, or they are lying. This is where MotionScan shines the brightest. The depth of the character’s expressing is fantastic and you’ll have to use those expressions to figure out whether they are telling the truth or not. At times dissecting the truth from the lies is rather difficult but most of the time it wasn’t too hard. A lot of the character’s tells are regurgitated over and over and the facial expressions are generally overdramatized. Regardless it is a ton of fun to interrogate someone to get one step closer to solving the case. Be careful though, there are consequences to doing a bad job. Outside of the main storyline there is little to take part in. There are side missions called “street crimes.” Unlike the campaign they are more or less regurgitated and not at all worthwhile in my opinion. You can also drive around and find all of the landmarks or try to find hidden cars. For such a large world there really isn’t a whole lot to do with it. You're free to explore the world but there is simply not a whole lot to see or do. It's like a fantastic themepark tucked away in some beautiful place but with only one ride.I first played L.A. Noire all the way back in 2011 on the Xbox 360. I fancied another play and decided to snag a copy for the PC. The unfortunate reality is that the PC version doesn’t offer much more than the Xbox 360. The game is locked to 30fps and suffers from some of the performance issues that the Xbox 360 suffered. I feel as if the game must have been rushed for its PC release. I suffered the occasional stuttering and even tearing despite have vsync engaged and more than enough hardware to handle the stress. The draw distances appear to be as short as they were on the consoles. I feel as if the game could have been made to better utilize the PCs superior power. Unfortunately it appears that this wasn’t the case. While the game is certainly playable these performance issues can be distracting and I feel as if they shouldn’t have ever been there in the first place. The most glaring annoyance is the FPS limit which may be more than a mild annoyance to PC gamers. Now, I have heard that the FPS limit was for the benefit of the facial animations. Apparently there is a FPS unlocker created by someone but I have yet to see how the facial animations work at higher frame rates.I decided to play the entirety of the campaign using my gamepad. Like Grand Theft Auto the game, in my opinion, is much better enjoyed with it. The driving was on-par or slightly above that of GTA IV. The combat mechanics feel unrefined and clunky, a problem that was equally persistent in bothering me on the 360. Fortunately combat is not the focus of L.A. Noire. I would consider the controls functional but not superb. The audio including the voice acting and background audio are no less than top notch. While you’re driving you are treated to period music and commercials. The voice acting and music score are engaging and enjoyable. Everything works seamlessly together to make you feel as if you’re really a detective in 1940s L.A. The recreation late 1940s L.A. is impressive. It is evident that a staggering amount of attention to detail was applied in its accurate depiction of the time. This applies to everything from the clothes, cars, hairstyles, architecture, and interiors. The game used a technology called MotionScan to record and transplants real actor’s facial expressions into the game. Overall this brings a truly unique cinematic experience and supports the games interrogation mechanic. It is a thrill to see so much detail in a game character and brings the world and experience alive. MotionScan could certainly use some polish and refinement but the implementation of the technology is definitely a good one. A handful of character animations are strange wonky. I wish some more attention could have also been applied to the more action-packed cinematic cut scenes. I know the game was made all the way back in 2011 but there’s a few that look downright silly. The game does a fantastic job of getting you absorbed in the world but there’s moments when an unpolished visual moments pulls you straight out. There exists the occasional discrepancy between textures. Some texture is lovely such as those for cars and interiors. On the other hand the gun textures (and reloading animations) are poor at best. Despite flaws L.A. Noire is an enjoyable and enthralling adventure. The game introduces new game mechanics, a story, and an environment that truly sets the game apart from the rest of the pack. It doesn’t matter that it came out three years ago, give this game a play. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A NoirePositives:+ A very cool and well thought-out detective thriller set in 1940's California, U.S.A. Playing as Coles Phelps you investigate homicides, thefts, drug trafficking and fraud, identifying crime scene clues and speaking to witnesses to gather evidence.+ A really nice feature of this game is the facial expressions used by characters. A lot of effort was put into this by the developers. After carefully observing how a person of interest behaves or talks, you can doubt what they are saying, judge whether they are lying, or believe them. If you're successful, you'll squeeze more information out of them leading to additional avenues in the case. This is good because it rewards the player for engaging in the game and playing it properly.+ Nice shootouts with several different types of weapons, although confrontations aren't that frequent. Use tommy guns, pistols or shotguns to take down foes. There's 40 street crimes to complete separate from cases.+ An intriguing storyline of crime, love and flashbacks of Cole Phelps life in the Marines during World War II. The ending is one you won't really expect. Really enjoyed it.+ Around 40-50 hours of gameplay with all DLC, trying to do your best on every case.+ Graphics are decent.Negatives:- The graphical quality of the game world could be improved. As it stands it still looks fine, but stunning visuals really do add to immersion.Overall Score: 9/10It's hard to fault L.A Noire.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! At least, not on PC.I had seen footage of this game before and was excited to give it a shot when it went on sale.  So, I picked it up and tried it out.  The first thing i noticed was that the game ran at low performance.  I was surprised, of course, given that I was running it on a GTX 1070 and getting 30 fps or less.  So, I googled the issue, and I learned that the game was locked at 30 fps-which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I set about finding a fix.  I came across widescreenfix, and started using it.  After about an hour of gameplay I came to the conclusion that the game was simply unplayable.  While, yes, my framerate went up, it only went up to 44 or so at most and even then the input was laggy and the game was extremely difficult to control.  At that point I gave up, and returned the game.All that aside my one hour stint in L.A. Noire was very entertaining.  Even through the pain of playing it it was clear that the game has a lot going for it.  The game doesn't place you in a truely open world, instead setting up the gameplay as a series of episodes, like from a detective show from the '60s or something.  It's difficult for me to elaborate further as I didn't get to play much of the game, but I really wish I could have.  While light, the combat worked well enough and its clear that the main focus of the game is on the detective side of things.Yes, you should buy this game, just maybe not on PC.And Rockstar, fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game.

												LA Noire is exactly as advertised, a dark gritty noire story. And thats great, this is why i love Rockstar, they never fail to impress. LA Noire puts you in the shoes of Cole Phelps, a beat cop who is working way up to detective. Now beat is pretty much the tutorial section, after this you earn Traffic detective. Now the story in this game is phenomenal, or at least each story (for the most part). Each desk you get a different partner, my favorite being Stefan. There is one flaw i have though with the partners though, they all have the same progression and personality. Like at first they dont really care for you too much but after your first case in each desk they think your the bees knees. The atmosphere in this game is great too, i love the 1940s feel and aesthetic. But theres also a flaw with the world in this game too, its kind of linear, what i mean by this is theres nothing to do outside of the main missions. They give you the option for free roam after you complete a desk but it kind of sucks, the characters in these free roam missions are cool but besides that the missions can get kind of repetitive. Theres no restraunts to go to, no movies to see, no bowling alleys, ♥♥♥♥ theres not even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ radio. But besides that i really dont have any flaws with the game world. Now with the main missions themselves, there pretty good, the best desks are Vice and Homicide. Each desk is different, this game even takes you into the investagation of the BLACK DAHLIA MURDERS!!! its pretty cool stuff. Now the funnest part of the missions in my honest opinion is questioning, but damn it can be frustrating too. So thats my review for LA Noire, i know it was long.LA Noire9/10Would doubt again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At a time when narrative in gaming is constantly trying to find its own identity, L.A. Noire does a fine job of giving you the right amount of control amongst the very well acted cutscenes. The facial recognition tech hasn't been attempted since, and for good reason. L.A. Noire is constantly ranked amongst the most expensive games ever made - and it shows in the quality of the facial animations. I will say, though, that in large crowd shots, it is quite easy to tell which characters have the facial motion capture and which don't - and the ones that don't (i.e. equivalent of 'extras' in movies and television) do not look very good.

												The best game I have ever played story-wise. The later cases of the game are played out like movies, with cinematic panning, orchestrated music and powerful voice acting. There are lessons to be learned all throughout the battles waged against corrupted city officials, mob wars, and narcotics. I highly reccommend this for anyone who wants to play through a good 40 hours of a brilliantly underrated game. Just be careful about the framerate issues with stale computers. 11/10			",29,10,1,7,4,0,1

												I've been looking for a game with good story for quite a while. After playing great titles like Fahrenheit, Mafia, and Alan Wake I wanted to touch up to those. L.A. Noire, even though an underdog in my book (was able to get it long time ago but decided not to due to bad optimalization for PC and some negative expectations from initial experience when trying it out). Despite all that I got it on the summer sale for 5 euro and it proved to be a great buy.Each case had a different original flavor to it, and I found myself feeling vibes of L.A. Confidential, True Detective (on Homicide department). I spent 24 hours on this game during 1 playthrough, and you could spend even more, if you completed all of the side-missions where you battle street crime. This game may be linear, but it sacrifices its freedom for great story-telling and immersion. So if you're into detective stuff (actual detective stuff, using wits, and intuition) then buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've bought this game for the PS3 first and was caught up in its nice story and gameplay.Bought it again for the PC because of DLC's and coz it was on sale at the time being. Money well-spent, imo.You are Detective Cole Phelps who is working for the LAPD. Your job is to solve crimes by bringing in witnesses, suspects etc. You follow leads and tracks you find at the crime scenes and use them to arrest the criminals. What I like really much is the fact that the emotions and gestures etc of the characters you talk to are also very important to find out if somebody is lying to you or telling the truth. Motion capturing ftw.Can only recommend this game. It also has very nice plot twists and I just love the time it takes places in. (I'm in love with that era, so my review might be a little biased :P)7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												L.A. Noire is reminiscent of a lot of us. We’re decent people sure, but we’ve become bloated with wasted potential. Maybe I should go ahead and compare Noire to a high-end escort. Sure, her parents are disappointed but she’s certainly bringing something different and enjoyable to your evening. You should definitely play L.A. Noire but like me you may walk away feeling that it could have been much more. There are also a slew of problems both technical and performance but the experience is fresh, invigorating, and will keep you playing through the night.L.A. Noire is heavily influenced by film noire. If you despise that genre maybe this game isn’t for you. The story is smothered in a thick layer of atmosphere with character personalities practically picked from the classics. Sure, some of the characters are definitely cliché but this plays to the games benefit. It’s supposed to be reminiscent of film noire and it does a damn good job at it. I won’t go too much into the characters or story because that’s something players should experience firsthand for themselves. It’s good and you should play it. The story can be described as paced and methodical. Unlike other Rockstar titles you won’t be blowing through waves of armed baddies every moment of the day. You’ll play as Cole Phelps, a veteran of World War II turned by-the-book detective in late 1940s Los Angeles. Because you’re a detective you’ll spend less time in shootouts and more time investigating crimes, interviewing suspects, and driving around in style. The investigations continue to introduce diversity in their story and characters but the central process generally stays the same. You’ll interrogate witnesses, chase down suspects, and sort through crime scenes for clues. The most prominent game mechanic is of course the interrogation mechanic in whom you judge whether your witness/suspect you believe the person you are interrogating is telling the truth, you doubt them, or they are lying. This is where MotionScan shines the brightest. The depth of the character’s expressing is fantastic and you’ll have to use those expressions to figure out whether they are telling the truth or not. At times dissecting the truth from the lies is rather difficult but most of the time it wasn’t too hard. A lot of the character’s tells are regurgitated over and over and the facial expressions are generally overdramatized. Regardless it is a ton of fun to interrogate someone to get one step closer to solving the case. Be careful though, there are consequences to doing a bad job. Outside of the main storyline there is little to take part in. There are side missions called “street crimes.” Unlike the campaign they are more or less regurgitated and not at all worthwhile in my opinion. You can also drive around and find all of the landmarks or try to find hidden cars. For such a large world there really isn’t a whole lot to do with it. You're free to explore the world but there is simply not a whole lot to see or do. It's like a fantastic themepark tucked away in some beautiful place but with only one ride.I first played L.A. Noire all the way back in 2011 on the Xbox 360. I fancied another play and decided to snag a copy for the PC. The unfortunate reality is that the PC version doesn’t offer much more than the Xbox 360. The game is locked to 30fps and suffers from some of the performance issues that the Xbox 360 suffered. I feel as if the game must have been rushed for its PC release. I suffered the occasional stuttering and even tearing despite have vsync engaged and more than enough hardware to handle the stress. The draw distances appear to be as short as they were on the consoles. I feel as if the game could have been made to better utilize the PCs superior power. Unfortunately it appears that this wasn’t the case. While the game is certainly playable these performance issues can be distracting and I feel as if they shouldn’t have ever been there in the first place. The most glaring annoyance is the FPS limit which may be more than a mild annoyance to PC gamers. Now, I have heard that the FPS limit was for the benefit of the facial animations. Apparently there is a FPS unlocker created by someone but I have yet to see how the facial animations work at higher frame rates.I decided to play the entirety of the campaign using my gamepad. Like Grand Theft Auto the game, in my opinion, is much better enjoyed with it. The driving was on-par or slightly above that of GTA IV. The combat mechanics feel unrefined and clunky, a problem that was equally persistent in bothering me on the 360. Fortunately combat is not the focus of L.A. Noire. I would consider the controls functional but not superb. The audio including the voice acting and background audio are no less than top notch. While you’re driving you are treated to period music and commercials. The voice acting and music score are engaging and enjoyable. Everything works seamlessly together to make you feel as if you’re really a detective in 1940s L.A. The recreation late 1940s L.A. is impressive. It is evident that a staggering amount of attention to detail was applied in its accurate depiction of the time. This applies to everything from the clothes, cars, hairstyles, architecture, and interiors. The game used a technology called MotionScan to record and transplants real actor’s facial expressions into the game. Overall this brings a truly unique cinematic experience and supports the games interrogation mechanic. It is a thrill to see so much detail in a game character and brings the world and experience alive. MotionScan could certainly use some polish and refinement but the implementation of the technology is definitely a good one. A handful of character animations are strange wonky. I wish some more attention could have also been applied to the more action-packed cinematic cut scenes. I know the game was made all the way back in 2011 but there’s a few that look downright silly. The game does a fantastic job of getting you absorbed in the world but there’s moments when an unpolished visual moments pulls you straight out. There exists the occasional discrepancy between textures. Some texture is lovely such as those for cars and interiors. On the other hand the gun textures (and reloading animations) are poor at best. Despite flaws L.A. Noire is an enjoyable and enthralling adventure. The game introduces new game mechanics, a story, and an environment that truly sets the game apart from the rest of the pack. It doesn’t matter that it came out three years ago, give this game a play. 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game can be split up to 5 parts according to cases. Patrol, Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Patrol cases are like tutorial so there is nothing to add much. Traffic cases are about small time issues like hit-and-runs, stolen goods, injuries or fatalities. It is good for a start up and it let's you to warm up to game. Homicide is about murder as you can foresee. From my opinion it is the best part of the game (All murders are related to real cases). Vice is the hardest ever you can get. It contains drug traffic, mafia and some other serious♥♥♥♥♥♥ The last one, arson is about burned houses. Not much to add.So let's look at the criteria of this game:Music: Nice action and investigation musics. When you get close to a investigation area.Plot: Really realistic plot. You get Cole's, who the main protagonist by the way, background info and as you continue you get into Cole's deep feelings. As the game starts to end, whole plot is completing to connect to each other.Cases: Though i finished the game, i was really really bored at Arson. As the game continues nearly everything stays as the same, except plot. You can't get anything new as you play further so it may get boring. Same evidence tactics and same interrogation methods etc.Interrogation: Interrogation is the most important thing. It is as important as collecting avidence. It opens so much options early on in the case. While interrogating, you need to look closely in the faces of charachters to understand whether they are lying or not. After you conclude that charachter is lying, you need an evidence to pressure him/her. As you continue it gets harder to understand from faces. Afterall interrogation system/mechanic is really good.However it is too ♥♥♥♥in hard to connect to game as it requires Rockstar Social Club♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hate this system as much as UplayLauncher. Rockstar really gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it. My only negative comment is about this.So if you like playing investigation games and hate Rockstar, 8/10 i would recommend you to buy when it's in sale.

												I got this game on sale with all the dlc for some ridiculously low price. I've heard good things, and the concept intrigued me, so that's the ultimate reason I pulled the trigger. I haven't played any of Rockstar's games in years, and I've never really been a big fan, so I wasn't too sure I would even like it. My favorite games tend to be first person, stealth, shooting / rpg type games like Fallout 3 / NV, Oblivion / Skyrim, Deus Ex, and Dishonored.With all that said, I would absolutely recommend this game to anybodywho has glanced at this game and been the least bit intrigued. It has something in it for everybody. Good dialogue and voice acting, interesting story, challenging action sequences, driving, shooting, invistigating. There's a lot going on here, and the game does a great job of bringing it all together.I'm also a sucker for the past and history, so I loved that the game is set in post WWII Los Angeles. The clothing, architecture, technology is all from that era, so for me that was really cool and also helped with immersion into the storyline.There is also a surprising amount of content. The story is long, and there are a ton of side missions you can do. I stayed away from the side missions because I was more interested in the story, which is unusual for me. I tend to do most or all side missions in games before tackling the story. Again, I feel like that says a lot about the immersion here. I was genuinely caught up in the storyline, and wanted to see what would happen next.With that said, my only major gripe about the game is that it gets really repetitive. They threw a couple new mechanics in here and there to keep you on your toes a bit, but for the most part, you end up doing the same kinds of things over and over aaand over. Another thing is that there don't seem to be too many (if any) real consequences for doing things badly, or straight up wrong. When interrogating, for example, it doesn't really seem like it matters if you get no answers or all of the answers.Even with those gripes though, this game was great, and I'm glad I gave it a shot. There's so much content here. I feel like I way more than got my money's worth even half way through the game. Like I said, if this game intrigues you at all, you should definitely give it a try, especially if you get it on discount.			",18,1,0,5,1,0,3

												The game was very refreshing and fun at the beginning but by the middle of the game towards the end the game became repetitive. Chasing criminals by foot or by car, trailing people to find out where they are headed, becomes annoying after awhile and extremely repetitive. the game should of been shorter ending in homicide or maybe just less missions. after 20 hrs of chasing people you don't want to chase anymore.

												It's exciting crime investigation game with interesting and not obvious cases.Of Course this game has unnecessary things like GTA style free roaming city that is boring as hell etc.But if you are searching for a great detective adventure, then it will be the right choice!I hope it will get sequel...

												This is just such a fantastic game, I dont know where to begin. Fantastic, open world experience. When I play this game, I actually get a very good feal of the post war 1940s. A great noir influenced detective masterpiece type of game. Rockstar games did a phenomenal job of even accuarely mapping out 1940s Los Angeles that a boy was able to show his dad where his childhood home was in the game! Also, One fantastic element that really adds to the nature of the game is all the emotions shown through facial expressions. You can read a characters body language by accuarely looking at their facial expressions.This game is totally worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On my first objective I accidentally hit a ♥♥♥♥ing train head-on. On my second objective I lost my hat.On my third objective and first proper case, I accidentally shot a fleeing Jewish man in the back of the head.On my third case I uncovered and arrested a kiddy fiddling diplomat and sent a pregnant woman to jail.On my fourth case I shot a guy in the throat hoping it'd be a non-lethal attack.I am not a good police officer.I achieved five stars for every case I mentioned.

												I absolutely love this game! I am hooked! I played L.A. Noir on the Xbox 360 years ago and enjoyed it then, however I don't think i appreciated the range of this game like i do now playing on my PC a few years later.  Maybe it's because i had a ""detective"" itch needing scratching, and this game certainly satisfies!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A beautiful game with great acting and an interesting story, but the gameplay is all lousy. The open world is completely unnecessary, the shooting is nothing but silly bloodbaths, and the interrogations seem like arbitrary choices with a 33% chance of dumbly poking the right key.It's basically great at everything but the gameplay.

												The game was very refreshing and fun at the beginning but by the middle of the game towards the end the game became repetitive. Chasing criminals by foot or by car, trailing people to find out where they are headed, becomes annoying after awhile and extremely repetitive. the game should of been shorter ending in homicide or maybe just less missions. after 20 hrs of chasing people you don't want to chase anymore.

												Had a hard time deciding if i would give this a thumbs up or thumbs down. but in the end i think i'll settle with a thumbs down. the game is a typical triple-A console release. with all good and bad that follows. i.e it has very good acting, writing, design and overall production quality. but it also have that typical handholdy wedonttrustourplayers kind of gameplay to it, which is a really bad approach to have in a game that seeks to be a clever and modern point and click-esque game. also, the game is also too f*cking long and the pacing is off. it was a blast to play for about 18 hours, after that it made me go ""does this game ever end?!"" and ended up being a drag, but it wasn't so painful that i wanted to quit though. another thing that is worth mentioning is that the game is locked at 30 fps and the pc port is sub-par. had to run it in singlethreaded mode to get rid of most of the performance issues and i have a pretty powerful pc all things considering.

												LA Noire is exactly as advertised, a dark gritty noire story. And thats great, this is why i love Rockstar, they never fail to impress. LA Noire puts you in the shoes of Cole Phelps, a beat cop who is working way up to detective. Now beat is pretty much the tutorial section, after this you earn Traffic detective. Now the story in this game is phenomenal, or at least each story (for the most part). Each desk you get a different partner, my favorite being Stefan. There is one flaw i have though with the partners though, they all have the same progression and personality. Like at first they dont really care for you too much but after your first case in each desk they think your the bees knees. The atmosphere in this game is great too, i love the 1940s feel and aesthetic. But theres also a flaw with the world in this game too, its kind of linear, what i mean by this is theres nothing to do outside of the main missions. They give you the option for free roam after you complete a desk but it kind of sucks, the characters in these free roam missions are cool but besides that the missions can get kind of repetitive. Theres no restraunts to go to, no movies to see, no bowling alleys, ♥♥♥♥ theres not even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ radio. But besides that i really dont have any flaws with the game world. Now with the main missions themselves, there pretty good, the best desks are Vice and Homicide. Each desk is different, this game even takes you into the investagation of the BLACK DAHLIA MURDERS!!! its pretty cool stuff. Now the funnest part of the missions in my honest opinion is questioning, but damn it can be frustrating too. So thats my review for LA Noire, i know it was long.LA Noire9/10Would doubt again			",74,12,2,12,16,1,2

												The game is a bit strange, to be honest. Not just because it’s not the classic “runny gunny” variant of Rockstar games, but mostly because I have solved 4 or 5 cases and it feels like I haven’t really done much. I’ve unlocked outfits that look like repaints of the same basic thing (Watch_Dogs would later come to have the same exact problem), and I seem to be unlocking intuition points I don’t really need since I can just Shift+Tab to a guide that tells me when people are lieing.I don’t want to sound like a mouthbreather who can’t handle not having violence in my face every ten minutes. But after 3 hours and two gunfights, I feel there should be a /little/ more peppered around.My very first case I failed immediately when the perp ran away. I went to fire at him, just once, and actually managed to hit him in the leg. Instant “You failed” screen, “Man got injured” it said. No kidding? He was fleeing.So I find a street crime a little later, THINKING I shouldn’t be shooting the masked perp with a firing gun. Since I couldn’t figure out how to melee with my gun drawn, I just tried rushing him. Mission failed. “Officer down” it says.Christ, make up your mind.Another street crime was a more clearcut gunfight, which was enjoyable but the game CLEARLY didn’t emphasize the gunplay. The controls were a bit sluggish as my dude slowly gets out of cover and slowly figures out that I’m holding the shift button to sprint to a different piece of cover. I haven’t died yet, but I have taken a few shots because Cole won’t move his friggn’♥♥♥♥♥I will admit, first impressions were pretty decent. They’ve taken a slight (but only slight) dip due to the clunky movement. I also don’t feel like an “open ended” game is the right platform for the investigative style it’s going for. Indeed, it’s hardly open ended at all. I can’t really “stop” any investigation and wander. Sometimes my police car gets a call that I can generally divert and deal with, but there’s no ‘wandering’ available. I’m wondering why the world is this large when all I can do is “Investigation” and “shoot some Mexicans over here”. Even clothing is changed via the menu, no shopping to be done.Is a more open world “unlocked” later? Rockstar is sometimes fond of that. If so, that’s fair. I’ll keep playing it (though mostly in one-hour chunks so my computer doesn’t explode).			",210,36,0,38,30,0,21

												L.A. Noire involves breath taking graphics and structure of the story so that as you play it, you have to constantly remind yourself to use the controller because you drift away thinking you are watching a 1940's detective movie. The facial expressions (animated by real actors and 32 different cameras to get every possible angle of the expression) , will blow you away. A great mix of clue finding, interrogating, and action, make this a game that I for one, had trouble stepping away from. The story line is intense and awe inspiring. A very recommended game for those who enjoy the action, adventure, and mystery genre.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												Being a game, it has its charms. NPCs glitching through doors, funny animations at times, crazy car physics, silly health regen, etc don't detract from the setting, the series of cases, detective mechanics and quite realistic representation of people.I don't like the overarching story though. It falls flat in some places, especially with how Cole Phelps falls from grace arbitrarily it seems. The individual cases are quite well written, but the overarching story is not.Highly recommended.			",263,44,12,13,14,3,29

												In L.A. Noire you play as Cole Phelps and begin with him joining the LAPD. During your game he rises through the ranks in the force. However don’t expect to see Cole react to his amazing progress in the police with anything other than a blank expression. This is indicative of on overarching problem the game has. While the story tries to make Phelps a compelling character there is a glaring disconnect between him and the player. You never see his family despite their existence being important to the plot. While you see moments from his time at war they never feel overly impactful. I didn’t care about Phelps which in a story like this is a deal breaker.The game focuses far too much on the technology that went into making it. While the facial recognition technology used is amazing that isn’t what makes a good game. The facial expressions are often laughably over the top (which is understandable when you think that it is actors being told to ‘look like your lying’) and destroy the immersive experience the game is trying to present. It often ends up with characters being too far inside the uncanny valley for them to be truly relatable However the game world is beautiful and represents 1940s Los Angeles very well. It’s obvious that a lot of time and research went into creating this world. It is full of landmarks, street crime and collectables to find. Yet the game lets you skip every driving section where you would have a chance at finding them. This feels like two games squashed together. One a detective based drama and one a GTA style action game in 40s LA. My issue is these two styles don’t fit as well together as they could and so the game feels split with neither mechanic living up to its potential.			",201,31,0,14,18,4,27

												L.A. Noire is everything you expect and more. An honest detective simulation of the highest standard set in the open world of, you guessed it, L.A. Created by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, I had a feeling this game was going to be fully fledged out, and they certainly delivered on that.You start off as a police officer with a strong justice driven ideological view, hellbent on making something of himself. You are given the opportunity to make your way up the law enforcement food chain, meeting new chracters and learning parts of the main character Cole's past life. I am only 6 hours in to the game as I write this but the cases so far feel very genuine. The game has a good sense of humour as most Rockstar games do but this one touches on some very dark material. I personally feel that this is a good thing and doesn't give the player the feeling that they are being babied. Although the game doesn't give too many incentives to go out exploring as some other open world games do, the world is huge and feels like a very authentic, and I'm not sure it would make sense in a game like this. The real draw to the game is the detective work afterall. There are some interesting side missions that you can get called in for but generally they all play out the same way. Bad guy breaks the law. Catch or kill the bad guy. Still, the setting is always interesting and it is something to do if you aren't satisfied by the campaign when you have completed it.My favourite part of the game was the interrogations. When interrogating a suspect/victim you are given the opportunity to decide whether you beleive they are lying or telling the truth. Using some impressive technology called ""MotionScan"" the faces of the NPC's in game almost feel real, albeit a tiny bit creepy at times. Thoug the system was fun and required thinking, I couldn't help but feel that sometimes it was impossible to tell if a character was being truthful or not. Maybe I'm just terrible at the game but it felt like sometimes I was required to guess rather than read the NPC's expressions.There are some cool ideas in the game that help keep you immersed in the game. An example of this are the doors in the game having golden handles when you may enter them, which means that you never run from door to door to check which are openable and which aren't. There is also no fast-travel feature in the game, but that doesn't mean you have to drive yourself everywhere. You're a cop, therefore you have a partner. You can tell that guy next to you to drive you from case to case which will skip to the area you need to go, but not before you and your partner's dialogue for the sequence is played to you. A particularly intriguing feature of the game is the ability to search crime scenes. This is a very fun feature that requires you to walk around the area and find clues. They are well explained to you as you find them so as a rule you should never feel like a clue is irrelevant. I did find that after a few consecutive crime scenes without breaks that finding the same beer bottle or cereal box on the floor became a little annoying, but completing a crime scene after finding all the clues in the area was a great feeling every time.Driving in L.A. Noire is fun but a little arcadey, which some people may like while others may not. I personally feel neutral towards it because I got my partner to drive me around everywhere after the first few hours and the is more about thinking intelligently than the actual gameplay mechanics. There is no lock-on system in L.A. Noire. Shooting can be a pain in the bum if you are using a controller to play the game, but you do it so briefly and so rarely that this should not prevent you enjoying the interesting gun scenes. In other words, guns are certainly not overused. Speaking of violence in this game, there is a boxing mechanic in the game that pops up when a suspect decides to engage you in hand to hand combat. This is as simple as blocking and punching and I found that mashing the attack button usually got the job done. I'm not too fussed about it because as I mentioned previously, the real gumption of the game is the detective mechanics.The main character of the game is interesting. He is quick witted and seems to be a very highly-principled officer, a nice change from Rockstar's usual hardstyled criminals we are usually made to play. I did feel that he could be a little spontaneously aggressive at times and he doesn't seem to treat his partners that well. The setting of the game is realistic. The game does not shy away from a lot of protruding themes of the time including racism, Nazi Germany and sexism. I will say that I feel Rockstar used these effectively to help you distinguish between the characters you are supposed to like and the characters you aren't even though for the time a lot of these things were considered ""normal.""Overall, I would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good story and some engaging mechanics. The game requires you to think about what you are doing without punishing you too much for making a mistake. The game doesn't baby you and a lot of the content is certainly aimed for an older audience, but if you are interested in an immersive interractive experience look no further than L.A. Noire.

												LA Noire combines FPS, puzzle, and 'racing' (frequent car chases) mechanics to make for a unique twist on the mystery/detective genre. With a semi-open world environment reminscient of large-scale games like Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto, there is much to explore and unlock. Story missions are, however, the focus of the game, often relying on thoroughness, fine-tuned deductive reasoning, and a good deal of reading facial expressions well, which the game renders exquisitely, better than any game before or since its time, in my experience.At this point something of a classic, any mystery novel fan or puzzle game enthusiast would do well to pick up this game.

												If you've grown tired of fighting against the law in a Rockstar game, then LA Noire is the answer. Catch petty crooks and major mob bosses in one of my favourite games!The main feature you've probably heard about is the interview system, decide from truth, doubt or lie when questionning witnesses or suspects, the results of those decisions changing the case and Cole Phelps' career.Go from beat cop to traffic detective, up through homicde and into the dangerous world of arson and vice, clean the streets whilst driving carefully (if thats even possibly in a rockstar game) to crimescenes and sweep areas to find evidence that could crack the case wide open.The game doesnt just allow you to interview suspects and search through trashcans, you will definitely get into a few brawls and gunfights along the way, whether you be tackling the mob, or just stopping a robbery, you wont feel the need for more excitement in Rockstars L.A. Noire.			",62,12,0,8,19,2,12

												Well i will try to keep it short:Pros:-Very good atmopshere-Good voice acting-Game only in english-Good animations-Nice cases to solve, including the problems with corruption in the 40'sCons:-Horrible background story on the main character-Nothing at all to do. I know this is not GTA. But you just drive from case to case... -Stupid collect them all! Items such as cars, Newspapers, Police badges, etc-Some cases are so entertataining as watching a funeral or a chess game. -Random ""Street crimes"" which take 2 minutes to solve, are only inteneded to make the playtime longer-No background information on your partners, except of rusty being a little alcoholic.-You always do the same. 0 innovation.-Solving a case is like this: Check crime scene, drive to the place you intended to drive, talk with people, accuse them, case solved-You cant put yourself into the Protagonist because all we know is that he fighted in the war, is married and he is a hypocrit.-Making even a scratch to a car while on a case, doesnt allow you to get 5 star rating. -a brick is more intelligent than the AINow for the best: THE GAME DOES NOT WORK ON WIN7/10 etc, why ?  I dont know. Did rockstar patch it ? No. How to fix it ? Thanks to the community.  When finishing the game you are so glad its over.P.S I didnt pay the full price, bought it for 6,99 euro.The game is never worth 30 euro.  Wait for sale, but the smartest thing to do is not to buy it.4/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Still not recommended as Rockstar are not supporting this game on recent versions of Windows.Broken does not launch, bought it in the sale and did not try it immediately or would have applied for a refund.  It seems it has been broken for most people for over a year with no fix and no proper response to the lauch issues from Rockstar.

												do not buy this game it will not work on win 10 and steam wont refund if u had it longer than 2  weeks even though they ask you to explore alll possible ways of getting it to work which i did now im stuck with a game that dont even bloody work thanks steam. but that wont be the end of it cause in the uk we have trading standards and they view this as not fit for purpose and i will get refunded regardless all u have to do is report it to trading standards and then report to your bank and under the visa guarantee you are covered for such instances. steam should not be selling games knowing that there are issues or at the very least issue a warning so atleast you are made aware. this is just another reason why the gaming industry needs to be better regulated to stop us gamers from being taken advantage of. i like steam very much but when things like this happen it really does spoil what should be fun and the majority of us work damn hard for our money only to be sold games that have issues and i really dont believe for 1 min steam arent aware of issues on some games. so from now on i will not purchase a game until i know for 100% it is as described and fully works.

												I was initially optomistic about getting this game. Despite what several of the reviews said, I willing to give it a shot.The problem I encountered is that the FPS locks around 30 FPS and seems to fluctuate frequently, which made the game difficult to play.L.A. Noire seems like a good game that people could really enjoy, but the PC port just isn't the greatest. If you want to play L.A. Noire, I'm sure your local GameStop has a copy you could get for dirt cheap.			",55,4,1,3,12,0,2

												This game is a pile of hot garbage. Unless it has some amazing reveal (like you've been in the animus or dreaming or delusional) after the first couple cases that sheds light on why the potrail of cops is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the basic gameplay mechanics are ridiculously flawed, I don't understand why it has any positive reviews. I see people compare this to a nega-gta, but honestly it just feels like playing gta from the prospective of a cop (who kills just about as many people as a side gta character). It doesn't do the ""detective"" experince well at all; the cases are either stupid simple or the pc makes ridiculous leaps in judgement about evidence and suspects. It's impossible to immerse yourself when the pc is soooo speculative, and you get no sense that you're in anyway stearing what he's saying. There are only ever 3 dialouge options, and none of them say anything about what happens when you choose them. Most of them cause the pc to explode completely unprovoked about something you wheren't even thinking of! I BARELY FEEL LIKE IM PLAYING AS THE PLAYER CHARACTER. Also, its racist as ♥♥♥♥, all of the cops are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s; it is litterly impossible to apprehend anyone without beating them to the ground or killing them. AND THIS IS NOT CALLED OUT AT ALL. There doesn't seem to be any tounge in check to the racism, not even time period awarness. There are moments of exteremely excessive police brutality AND NOT A WORD IS SAID, there is no undertone of acknowledgement of anything, its like the game just shrugs its shoulders and walks away without addressing it.  This game isn't even worth an in-depth review, so here's a comparative one: Imagine GTA but all the story is told through the worst designed and most historically ignorant Telltale game ever made.

												It's a good game but not a great one. I don't know you folks but I find it boring to do the same sh*t over and over again and in these days, a lot of gamers whine about this issue. I'm not saying this game makes you do same thing over and over again. Cases differ from each other in many aspects but basicly they are all the same to me. Go to crime scene, gather evidence, interview with some people, gather more evidence, interview with more people, then it comes to accusing. The game is actually based on gathering evidence and reading peoples faces correctly. But it's not enough, you have to bring up the right evidence in order to push the guy you are interviewing. And these things repeats itself in every case. So, about 11 hours of playing I asked myself, ""Why am I even playing? Just to go gather evidence and interview people?"" Well yes, that's basicly what the detectives do. So I shouldn't whine about this. It just bores me. Maybe you can enjoy it. Persnally, I think you should buy it when its on summer sales or else like %75 or more discount.			",82,6,0,2,4,1,7

												A different sort of game, L.A. Noire allows you to step into the world of James Elfroy's L.A. Quartet.  While a sandbox, it is a different type, rewarding inspection of the crime scene more than blazing away at bad guys.I typically play one case (which can last one to two hours) before giving myself a break.  A lot of friends have burntout on the game, which is a shame.  It can be a slower paced game, but it doesn't take away from the fact Rockstar created Los Angeles of 1947 in near perfect detail.

												La NoireGenre:  Action-AdventureType: Single-playerPlot: The story takes place in Los Angeles in 1947, and you play as Cole Phelps. The game follows him though his career in the Police. In the game you get assigned cases, and you're job is to solve them. That involves travelling to the crime scenes, look for clues, interrogate witnesses and chasing bad guys. The graphic in this game is the best. They have used a technology called Motion scan, which basicly transfers the actors every move into game animation.  This animation is especially useful when interrogating people, because you can read their body language. I liked this game very much and would definitely recommend this game to everyone. There is lots to do! If you don't want to do cases, you can drive around enjoying Los Angeles in the 1947, or you can answer distress calls.  I enjoyed this game very much, and its quite cheap these days!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off: the cutscenes are unskippable. And pretty long.But don't worry, because the gameplay IS skippable. No, really.It's very clear Rockstar wanted to make a movie, not a game, here.In general, the crime scenes are either walk around spamming the interect buttons, accuse and backtrack interviews, and running after perps.The combat is pretty bad. NPCs on your side are pretty worthless and either hunker down doing nothing, or stand up and get killed after a hit or two. And you go down almost as quickly. And the NPCs you fight often have some pretty good accuracy.Which explains why they gave you an option, if you keep losing and having to restart at the previous 3 minute unskippable cutscene, to SKIP THE GAMEPLAY.

												So this game is an interesting one, being known for being the first game to use facial motion capture from actors and also being a game that got really hyped up before release only to end up bankrupting it's creator Team Bondi. This game was ambitious and to be honest it's a shame it didn't do better. It didn't quite live up to the hype but it's still a good game.You play Cole Phelps, a LAPD detective and decorated WWII vet with the game set in LA in 1947. The basic premise of the game is that you investigate various crimes and interrogate and question witnesses and suspects. So you'll show up to a crime scene and have to explore it looking for clues as to what happened and clues that might link to a suspect. Once you have your evidence you can question suspects. And this is where the facial capture comes into play. When your questioning a suspect they'll give you an answer to your question and then you can choose to believe they're telling the truth, doubt them or prove they're lying using evidence. You have to watch their facial expressions to figure it out as when they're lying they'll look visibly nervous or irritated. Guess correctly and they might spill some more useful info like a new suspect or evidence.It is a really interesting feature although it can be a bit difficult especially when choosing between doubt and lie. Also get it wrong and Cole just starts shouting at them for no reason, like he's some bipolar idiot.As for the rest of the game, well firstly the recreation of 1940's LA is brilliant. The look and feel of the city is amazing but   the big open world of LA is never fully utilized in the game and having this big beautiful city, most of which you'll never explore nor have reason to, feels a bit wasteful. You also have street crimes which come up as your driving between locations which are useful for getting experience points to rank up but get repetitive as they are all some combination of either pursuing a criminal or shooting them.The big feature of the game,the facial motion capture, is great and this game has probably the most detailed faces in any game. It also features a lot of familar actors from various tv shows, although sometimes the acting is a bit over the top but still good for the most part.The Good:- investigating crime scenes and questioning people is really enjoyable- the 1940's LA in the game looks and feels amazing and authentic- facial motion capture looks great- Most of the cases are enjoyable and interesting- Pretty good story The Bad:- a big open city that feels like a waste as there's little reason to explore most of it- street crime missions can be repetitive (although not compulsory)-combat sections aren't very impressiveOverall this game is a victim of it's own hype but don't let that put you off. It's still a great game and worth getting particularly if your the type that likes crime thrillers. I'd also recommend by the complete edition so you get the all the DLC cases as well. All the DLC cases are good, particularly Nicholsons Electroplating so it's worth paying a little extra for them. This game gets a 8/10 from me.			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

You are war hero coming back from Okinawa and you become a cop slowly rising yourself up to the high detective in homicide cases to the fall of some police politics and corrupt cops. You deal with a lot of crime action and investigating. After half way through the game you start to get bored of doing the same thing over and over. The ending (I will not spoil it) WAS ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL. Omg one of the worst endings ever I spent 30 hours on this game and ended up being dissapointed...

												L.A Noire is a gritty crime drama set in the 40's of Los Angeles, where the player plays the role of Cole Phelps, Detective of the LAPD. The game sees you play 4 desks which are traffic, murder, vice and arson. The gunfights are seldom(ish) but are very fun and realistic. The game also has call-outs that may occour at any time whilst you are driving. Moreover, the game also offers landmarks that you discover by driving around the streets of LA. You can also collect vehicles, and this will earn you (approximately) 3 achievements on Steam, Xbox or PS3. A lot of people complain about having hardware problems, but the only problem I've ever experienced is the Checking for DLC problem. It is capped at 30 FPS, but that is to make sure every detail is in sync. In conclusion, this game receives a 9/10. I would score a 10/10 but the problems affect a large scale of people. However, it is nothing Google can fix. Definitely should buy.			",44,4,0,5,2,0,1

												Awesome story alongside the most unique gameplay I've ever encountered make L.A. Noire one of the best games I've ever played. When you get all the questions right, find all the clues and make a perfect-5 stars case you get one of the best feelings you can get in a video game. It's really rewarding, but when you fail you want to punch yourself in the face.The post WW2 Los Angeles is a city full of crimes, so it will keep you busy for a while (besides the main-story cases, there are 40 street-crimes and a lot of collectibles to find - great ammount of content). The DLC cases are amazing, so I recommend getting the Complete Edition.This game is a masterpiece, 10/10.			",135,19,1,6,1,1,4

												The game takes place in 1947 in Los Angeles. The player acting as a detective of the Los Angeles police (eng. Los Angeles Police Department, abbr. LAPD) named Cole Phelps, to reveal a number of crimes. For this, you will need to see a place where they occurred, in search of clues, and all kinds of clues that may lead to the offender. The success of the investigative action, the player will depend on how will be fully disclosed to the picture of the incident.In addition to the story missions, players can receive calls on the police radio. In the game these tasks are called street crimes (eng. Street Crimes). Players can walk, and on different machines, which are opened along with the main character in the service. Besides the machines, the player is available for ten costumes for the character (4 of them are DLC). Some suits have special properties, such as increase of protection from damage or increase accuracy when firing.Unlike other games Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto, players are prohibited from unrest and kill citizens, since the main character of the game is the detective police.IN THE «L.A. Noire» the emphasis is not on the creation of an open world, as it was in previous games «Rockstar» (in particular, Red Dead Redemption of series Grand Theft Auto), but quality of story line. According to the developers, their project must erase the existing border between games and movies». The main hero - patrol officer Cole Phelps, who, thanks to the diligence and seriousness of attitude is gradually moving up the career ladder. Translation into the new Department each time accompanied by «adaptation» to the new companion, which can not always find understanding. Among them and the police of the old school, working for the idea, and спивающийся detective, more worried about retirement, and Thrifty careerists with dubious connections. In some investigations Phelps will have to face not only with the criminal world of Los Angeles, and former colleagues, with whom he fought in the Second world war. However, his most dangerous enemy is corruption among police...Yes, the game does not actually be «sandpit». You will not be able to create your gameplay, because everything is subordinated to the plot. But the world will open review, and will be the mission, which will allow you to escape from the direct path to a climax. For example, going to a crime scene, you suddenly get a call that somewhere right now robbing a Bank. You can change the route and go there.P.S. In a free mode «Streets of Los Angeles, you can patrol the streets, the sights, collect videos and leave the challenges reported by the Manager.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You deal with a lot of crime action and investigating. After half way through the game you start to get bored of doing the same thing over and over. The ending (I will not spoil it) WAS ♥♥♥♥ING AWFUL. Omg one of the worst endings ever I spent 30 hours on this game and ended up being dissapointed... I would reccommend it, but no more than 4.99 on steam sale.			",540,114,10,37,48,5,71

												This game is ok at best. I thought I would like it because Mafia II is one of my favorite games, but the gameplay doesn't come close. I realize it is a detective game, so a totally different thing. I think if the stories were more intriguing it would make up for the gameplay being a little archaic/lame. Don't get me wrong it isn't a bad game, but could have been much better.			",43,2,0,5,5,0,11

												This game is really what you make of it.  If you use the crutches in game options it's a fairly straight forward game with movie quality characters and story.  If you turn the crutches off, you'll ride the highs and lows of being a police detective in the 1940's, so much so that after a bad case you're gonna want to go on a bender and slug your wife.  Don't do it though.I used the crutches playing the tutorial cases and it seemed fairly easy getting all the clues with little music tones and hints where they are and the music stops you've found them all in an area, then it was a little challenging during interrogations trying to find the right approach and use the right evidence when catching them in lies.Then I discovered how to turn EZ mode off.  Go to game options and change ""Clue Music"" to ON so there's no music indicator for when you've found all the clues, and turn ""Clue Hints"" to off so there are no hints to where clues are.Once you take EZ mode off, the game is really fulfilling as the successes become oh so sweet, and the failures are absolute facepalm.  Without 100% certainty of finding all the clues, it gets REALLY frustrating as suspects lie to your face but you don't have the evidence to nail them, and the facial animations are so lifelike that you'll seriously want to backhand people as they roll their eyes and smirk during questioning.  Great game, well worth the money, and I'm only halfway through it.  (Warning: my play time doesn't reflect how long the game actually takes to beat because I've had to spend alot of time on the pause screen.)			",92,12,0,5,25,1,8

												Great detective game without becoming a point and click adventure. None of the puzzles are incredibly hard, but the game tells a good story with plenty action.			",48,12,0,5,8,0,2

												I love this game. And I will tell you why.Graphics: The graphics rock. La noire isnt optimized for PC and lags for a lot of people. Either install AMD and the correct video cards or have someone do it for you. AMD lets you optimize games that lag a lot to make them sync correctly. Doesnt lag a bit for me and graphics rock 10/10Gameplay: The gameplay is fun and puzling. Nothing more to say 10/10Roam: The free roam idea is a good idea because you cant do about anything /: ",78,8,0,4,4,0,1

												It's a BAD pc port, as its capped at 30FPS, and it has texture popins and other oddities. If its really cheap though, buy it. Otherwise, skip it. It has a solid story and its for those guys who wanna be detectives and find ALL the clues, but if you want a sandbox game, then please go get something else!			",294,57,10,35,28,3,56

												In my opinion, this is Rockstar's finest work. Great characters, truly unqiue gameplay, super cool setting, and a fantastic soundtrack. This is probably one of the true great detective games that's not one of those cheapo hunt and find games. Brilliant visuals intermixed with 1940s Americana brings a gritty yet suave experience that I highly recommend.			",115,15,0,0,2,1,0
