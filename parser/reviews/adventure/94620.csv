												“If I could get off this thing I’d come over, shake your hand and say congratulations, you’re ret@rded.”There is no mistake that the humour in this game series is the highlight of the whole experience. It’s a slightly darkish humour but funny none the less. Especially if you get the quirky little remarks and references only a fellow brit would. Hector: Badge of Carnage is a point and click adventure game set in a small ♥♥♥♥♥♥ British town that has been overrun with corruption and lack of giving a toss. Full of chavs, junkies, prozzies and rather crappy coppers you play as Hector, a questionable detective who is going to help the town, catch the bad guy and save the day! …so he can indirectly help himself to probably go back to the pub or for a kip. Dialog in this game is very amusing, at least it was to me. I would recommend the game for that alone.Characters are enjoyable most of the time, the main ones are loveable, the… chav and junkie extras and whatnot not so much. But they’re WRITTEN to be annoying! So good job, old bean!What I remember of the music wasn’t bad. Didn’t make me want to pull my hair out so that’s a good start.Graphics are nice, I enjoy classic point and clicks more so then the newer ones and this game series is definitely one that should be on the list for anyone that likes the same. Literally the only problem I had with this series is that I had a crash during the second episode. I lost no progress but it was still mildly annoying. Apart from that and me having a slow start with it (probably the old point and click brain trying to boot up again) I haven’t a bad word to say about it.TL;DR : Great/slightly dark British humour,  amusing characters, nice graphics and an all-around great little series, I recommend any point and click fan buys it.

												If stuffing a comatose heroin addict into a love doll box and returning him to a adult toy store for an exchange offends you, then this is not the game for you!Is it a fun adventure game? Yes. Not a very challenging adventure game but it is fun.Is the storyline fun? Yes, although there is a LOT of british slang dialogue, it's not hard to understand the humor.Would I replay this game, probably not, but that won't stop me from giving it a rating of 7/10.

												+ Funny game with excellent dialogue. Lots of British slang. The mechanics of the game is simple: click once to See an item, double-click to Use it. All 3 episodes are connected, but Episode 2 is probably my favourite because it has the largest number of locations. The story isn't the greatest, but there is a big plot-twist at the end of Episode 2.- The graphics are cute but the game's maximum resolution is quite-small, and doesn't support wide-screen.

												This point&click adventure is really funny. Puzzles are decently complicated, the story makes sense in its own way, and what will keep you interested is the fantastic (and really cynical) humour. Don't get fooled by the thick British accent: it's not just about British humour! There's some ""heavy"" stuff involving taking a crap to make a building explode, and using drug addicts to get refunds. And much more.It's certainly worth paying a few euros/dollars/pounds for 10 hours (maybe slightly less, I'm counting the three episodes all together) of entertaining dialogues and puzzles.

												Game features various british accents and a load of slang and wordplays and has no localization - and it's not a starter's english material, keep this in mind before purchasing.One of the most undeservedly forgotten games - published by Telltale games before they started doing the interactive movie-type of games. Hector is a traditional point and click, and it's a fairly easy one - it has some point and click logic to it, especially given by it's twisted style, but it helps with lots of references ingame, and with an ingame full guide.The game is quite mature in topics, but at the same time has crude, juvenile and absurd humour. Play the policeman who for whatever reason goes the distance to save his cesspool of a town while verbally abusing whoever he can, comitting breaking in, indecent exposure, blackmailing, felony and some other nice stuff just to get the job done. Certainly it takes a personality to put up with the game, but the game has really high production value. Filled to the brim with wordplays for better of worse, original ideas, a honestly great storyline and really memorable puzzles. I can understand that the game is not for everyone because of it's style, but I do believe that the game is genuinely outstanding, and one of the very best point and clicks I've ever played. Very much recommended to get it if you're interested!			",970,514,12,137,64,4,122

												Firstly I'll say it's a travesty no sequel has been made to Hector, come on Telltale, there's plenty of us that prefer Hector to your cheesy franchises. It's maybe the best adventure game I've played, certainly the most enjoyable and most humerous. And I've played allot of them. The main character is a sarcastic, crude, crass, slob of a detective but with plenty of masculine humour. He's essentially Gene Hunt from Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes. The humour is quick witted and vulgar. The voice acting and timing of it all is perfect for the characters. The puzzles are logically of maybe a medium difficulty, which doesn't halt story progression. And story and interraction between the characters is key to the enjoyment you get from this game as with any great adventure. The story arc doesn't disapoint and despite the aged graphics you feel immersed in the environment. You feel a real sense of connection to the characters. Graphics are cartoonish which fits with the comical nature of the game. Buy it or put it to the top of your wishlist at least. It really deserves more sales to maybe encourage a sequel. Come on let us start a cult Hector following. It's loads better than the Sam & Max series or Deponia series for my money, neither of which are anywhere near as funny.			",60,197,2,19,13,0,23

												Note that even if the title says ""Hector: Episode 3"", the review is for the full 3-episode series.Detective Inspector Hector is sort of like The Dude. He's the right man for his place and time. Hector is a cop in the degenerate town of Clappers Wreake, a place which has so abandoned the notion of anything wholesome that the street out front of the police station itself features ♥♥♥♥♥s, drunks, and looting.And so the story is set in motion: a sniper appears in a window in town, gunning down police and boasting a roomful of hostages. Hector is called to the scene to deliver his unique brand of justice, only to be set on a series of errands for the mysterious gunman who claims only to have the betterment of Clappers Wreake at heart.Hector is fat, blunt, rude, an alcoholic, and not a connoisseur of self-respect. He's every ounce as much of a degenerate as the rest of the population, but he's smarter than a good deal of them, and he's willing to do what it takes to save the day. For... well, some reason or other, anyways.Hector: Badge of Carnage contains a lot of crude humor. The first screen of the first game involves fishing in a disgusting toilet with a used condom. But there's an interesting wit about it - particularly in Hector's observations on the situation. Yeah, this series is for the immature, through and through. But it's a sarcastic immaturity that's aware of its actions, and doesn't just settle for, ""Look, poop, ha ha!"" as an entire joke.The voicework is not a highlight. The first game sounds as though it's voiced entirely by one guy speaking into his laptop's built-in microphone. The second game adds a genuine female voice to the cast, but that's still only two voices, seemingly digitally altered to sound more diverse. At the very least, the delivery's good, so it's nothing that'll ruin your experience.On the whole, the puzzles are decent enough. The third game has a habit of making new elements appear in locations you've already visited, and then not alerting you to them, so that you have to stumble across them in a fit of random, confused wandering. But overall, I like Hector: Badge of Carnage. And if, like me, you're both an adventure game fan and a scumbag, then you probably will, too.			",401,187,13,44,46,6,60

												Hector: The badge of Carnage is sold as full package that includes all of the episodes, so I’ll give my review as a single game even though it has three separate executables. The series tells a single story arching over the three episodes and therefore act as one in that sense as well.A terrorist is on loose at Clappers Wreake and it’s your job as titular Hector to save the town. Very little is actually worth saving since the place is run down and infested with trash – both literal and as in its citizens. In your aid is an annoying and useless (the game’s own words) sidekick called Lambert. Hector himself is no ordinary policeman and neither are his methods: There is not a single decent thing you do in this game! You have to insult people, drug people, cheat people. You’ll participate in organ trading, church burning and evidence forging among other things. I especially liked the part where you beat up a dairy farmer.This might seem as crude and you can be sure it is. It’s all presented with loads of dark and tasteless humour that you either love or you hate. Every human orifice and fluids found within gets some time in the spotlight. I kind of liked the totally absurd conversation options and just listening to the madness. Puzzles are relatively easy and you can breeze through most of the game. There is a really generous hint system if you ever get stuck and even a full walkthough can be  found in the menus.Graphics have nothing to give praise for. Animation is there just to get the job done but it's not very polished. The game does support wide range of resolutions, at least up to 1920x1080, but the assets are not 16:9. Instead the game leaves black bars on both sides of the screen and it’s really hard to tell any meaningful difference between the resolution settings. The graphical quality cannot be customised any other way. I didn’t notice any crashing, bugs etc. during my playthrough, which took about 4 hours per episode.Hector’s voice acting really hits the spot and his delivery combined with the horrible things he’s saying is what kept me motivated. Every character has a thick British accent with a lot of slang that is at times hard to understand. No matter, since every unfamiliar word is an insult anyway. Whatever other sounds or music there was didn't make any impact.I’m a little bit ashamed to admit it but I laughed far more than anyone should at this game. I have given warnings about the content and if it still sounds like something you might enjoy, you’ll get your moneys worth. Recommended!			",157,45,6,9,1,0,5

												Hector: Badge of Carnage is a hidden gem in the TellTale Adventure games. You play as Hector, a crude and vulgar British Detective over 3 episodes which are all linked together very well. The storyline and characters you meet are interesting and are always surprising. The writing, voice acting and comedy are superb and the hand drawn characters and environments are all well done. If you're looking for a comedic point and click adventure game, this is a must have! I wish TellTale would come out with more episodes!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is for the series as a whole. Hector: Badge of Carnage is a point & click game, the style and humour of the game isn't for everyone, frequently being offensive and vulgar but never the less i found it hilarious. I think you'll either love it or you'll hate it, so be warned. The player takes control of Hector a drunk, mean, unclassy detective, that happens to be quite good at his job, to save the town Clapper's Wreake from a terrorist attack.Unfortunatly there isn't really much replay value, but what's there story/graphics/voice acting etc is great for the type of game.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hector: Badge of Carnage is a decent adventure game.  I was never disappointed with the responses I received from Hector when interacting with his environment and with others as the dialog is varied and entertaining.  I thought the puzzles were fairly easy, but Hector's partner, Lambert, was able to provide clues in a roundabout way had it been necessary.  There was even a hint option beyond that, unbelievably.However, the game isn't without it's flaws.  In fact, it suffers from a few glaring issues that make me just about want to not recommend this game and they both involve the voice dialog.Firstly, there only seems to be three or four voice actors for the entire game.  One voice sounds like an Asian making a pathetic attempt at a Brittish/Scottish accent and every time I heard this voice it grated on my nerves.  Secondly, some of the dialog has horrendous production value and sounds as if it were recorded with an extremely cheap desktop microphone with its gain set to max.  A third notable but much less irritating issue is that some of the text and voice didn't match and on a few occassions there was no voice at all.I would still recommend this game, but if I had to rate it I would probably give a 6/10.BTW, even though I chose to write a review for ""The Complete Series"", it's listed as a review of Episode 3 in my profile which lists as 4 hours played.  It took me ~12 hours to complete the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Detective Inspector Hector is a man of very few talents yet he's probably the smartest man in Clappers Wreake. Your job as Hector is to save Clappers Wreake from an evil terrorist who threatens the town. With you on the job is your very opposite, the kind, caring and thin Assistant Lambert. Click your way through Clappers Wreake on a quest to solve the mystery and to finally catch the terrorist. You will not be disappointed when playing this game because you will in the very beginning see what it has to offer. Hector is a 10-15 hour game spread out across 3 parts, which are all filled with british toilet humor and surprisingly fun gameplay. The puzzles do not really pose a great challenge but they get tougher at times. As a conclusion; You will difinitely like this game if you enjoy British humor and point-and-click games. Being Detective Inspector Hector is definitely a unique experience that must be tried for yourself.			",93,30,1,7,8,2,8

												Fun and logical adventure game. Great humor, though it's more dirty than other Telltale games.Most puzzles are pretty straight forward, but if you're still having problems there's a good hint system - and if that is not enough, you can just get the answer.Each episode is around 4 hours long.

												A fun and pleasant point-and-click experience if you like the genre and enjoy Brittish fart humor (which I do...). Suitable difficulty and mostly logical puzzles (obviously in a twisted way...). A few glitches, but nothing that disturbed gameplay. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1st, I must admit that I enjoyed it,  for the most part.    The story is enjoyable/entertaining enough, so I'm really writing this review for people looking for a reason to not buy it.it's your typical point/click adventure game.    You're really buying this game for the story (more then gamemplay).Its an interesting mix of Brit and American Humor.  The text -tree  dialogues are pretty good  (  you  may get bored w/ them and just want to move the story along ..  ((  at least I did ))   at which point  you're  kind of missing part of the game)  so  idk.        where does the fun stop and tediousness set in?  most of the 'puzzles' are pretty straight forward...  though there are some that arent obvious ( which can be  frustrating since you know what u need to do, but its wanting you to do it a certain way)     example :  I needed 'something'  and I found 'something'   only that wasnt the 'soemthing'  they wanted me to use... the ""something""  they wanted me to use  I needed to ask for from someone i didnt realize i could even talk to. the game does come with an in game  help/cheat    but  even it doesnt give u a complete walkthrough   (and if you watch the help on line.. . you might as just watch the game online  instead of buying)So if you're a fan of Telltale games/  P&C adventures/  and can get it for $5 or under i'd say  give it a go...

												This game, a hillarious and wildly inappropriate throwback to the ancient Sierra/Lucasarts/Telltale point-and-click adventures of yesteryear.Perhaps it is because I was raised on King's Quest, Sam & Max, and Monkey Island, but these games have always had a special place for me.Though I am convinced there are no more than 2 voice actors at the most, this fully-voiced adventure is chock-full of offensive innuendo, double entrendre, and bizarre british insults.From obnoxious ""Chav"" teenagers, morbidly obese strippers, porn shop enthusiasts, blind perverts, and angry old ladies with tazers, the conversations had me rolling with laughter throughout. Coupled with the crass bitterness of the alchoholic main character, and goofy puzzles, there was entertainment without too steep or shallow of a difficulty curve.I bought the entire series for 5 bucks, a downright steal for 3 games, and though my experience with this genre may have shortened the playtime to a few hours per episode.

												     Point and Click adventures are a finicky bunch; regardless of whether the genre as a whole appeals to you or not, there are always a few titles that you will love simply because of the thematic material. I personally find myself on a fine edge with the genre. I tend to get frustrated easily with the Sierra logic puzzles but at the same time I will often stick it out simply to see the next moment of storytelling. This can hold true even if the characters are not ones I have previously been invested in.      Sadly I just was not impressed by Hector. I made it maybe halfway through the first chapter/episode/adventure/whatever and just had no desire to suffer through the point and click gameplay to see the story pan out. I only briefly started the second iteration/sequel/whatever and it was just more of the same. The gameplay was by no means flawed and the art was actually rather marvelous, but Hector as a character just did not appeal to me.     Obviously I have no way to concisely convey all of my tastes in entertainment so I think my best advice would be to check out the trailers for the game, and maybe watch the first 10-15 minutes of gameplay on youtube. If you like the humor and the narrative then definitely pick up the trilogy when it goes on sale next. Otherwise, there are tons of other franchises out there to enjoy. I personally love the Wallace and Grommit titles, as well as the Back to the Future series.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												The game was developed with tablet devices in mind and it shows. Unappealing setting and low brow English humor that misses its mark more often than not make this one a miss to all but those that have no other adventure games to play. Buy it cheap for your I-Pad/phone instead.  ",452,184,10,54,37,3,54

												Hector. this game holds a special place in my heart for gaming becuase its the most vulgar humored game you can find on the market and there are so many things you cant help losing youself to laughing at. this is a basic detective game that uses the most conventional storyline. terrorist haunts town and makes demands. but in the most unconventional place the town of wreake this town is filled with the dirtiest, most disgusting populace u will ever know and hector the main character is a lazy, sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it is great to play as him. So grab the game and see for yourself the hilarity hidden within. this is my number 2 cheap game grab, b4 just cause 2			",383,42,8,33,12,4,25

												Just a short review on this one.You play as Hector and occasionly his much abused partner, Lambert.  Together you must stop a criminal master mind from destroying your thoroughly detested town, it won a award for it, of clappers wreake.  You will have to leave no garbage can un rummaged and no stain uninvestigated. You will also have to keep finding your clothes. Can you keep Hector out of his favorite bar long enough to crack the case?This a pretty good point and click adventure. If youy like stories that are parodies of their genre then you'll proably get this one.  Quite a bit of the humor is low brow, I didn't find it too offensive myself, so you might want to watch who's around if your playing with your speakers on or the youngin's might find some interesting names to experiment with. The game basically reminded of a british ""The Naked Gun"".  The game is made up of three parts.  In each part you have to solve the various puzzles to move on.  I didn't find the puzzles to be to much of a brain twister, but there are couple that had me scratching my head for awhile.  Luckily there is a built in hint system if the games wacky humor has you wanting to guide Hector off the nearest roof or something. All in all give this one a shot if you like parodies, british humor, and point and click adventures. You might just get a laugh or two.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At this moment in time I've only played the first 2 games I shall be playing the third ASAP, I would not say the game had me in stiches but it did make me laugh many times at some moments, Its kinda what drew to buying this seires via the trailers. Gameplay seemed to flow really well from beginning to end since your only pointing and clicking but there was a minor bug in the 1st game, with a little time out being stumped in how to progress but the game helps you out without resorting to the net for any help (if your smart enough ""heh"").For any ""British"" person out there I would highly recommend this just highly for the humor value in what hector and the the inhabitants of Clappers Wreake has to offer. It could do with improvement but in a slight way but would be me berating the game, but it gets a high mark from me. I highly recommend playing this game if you love your point and click games, Its not long it should take about 3 - 4 hours tops (well for me) but was worth it.Enjoy!			",460,108,8,76,39,4,69
