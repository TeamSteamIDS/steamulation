												Before Crystal Dynamics took hold of the franchise, Tomb Raider was in dire straits. The downward spiral had finally reached the bottom, and you'd be forgiven for wondering if we'd ever see Lara Croft return to relevancy again. But just like that, Legend was released and all was forgiven, with a tighter knit, better polished, and more cinematic Tomb Raider than we had seen in years. The follow up, Anniversary, reworked the original TR with a modern engine and a handful of additions and fixes to polish it off into something that, while not quite the hit Legend was, set the stage for the final game in the trilogy, Underworld, which fully showcases all the CD was aiming for by combining the best parts of their past two games into a fitting end to their first run with Lara, and a solid game in its own right.Underworld is a direct sequel to Legend, which means if you haven't played the latter (and preferably Anniversary as well), you're going to quickly become lost in a sea of supernatural monsters, returning characters, and a plot that bites off quite a bit more than it can chew. All that said, it finally answers most if not all of the questions proposed by the last two games, finally giving Lara some closure for all that's happened up to this point, as well as for the trilogy, allowing CD free control to go wherever they like with a sequel. It's not going to blow your mind or keep you thinking about it after the credits role, but the narratives blockbuster mentality is more than enough to entertain and carry the game through to the end (provided you don't stop to think about why anything is happening alone the way).While Legends focused more on style and set pieces, and Anniversary on classic tomb raiding and puzzle solving, Underworld finally manages to meld these two halves almost perfectly, creating what I would consider the truest expression of Tomb Raider Crystal Dynamics has made. The mechanics themselves have been expanded significantly from past games, with platforming in particular getting a much needed upgrade thanks to Lara's larger move set, which feels far more natural and free form than what we've seen in the past as well as allows for a greater amount of variety in the level designs. The levels themselves have also gotten a boost, now on an outrageous scale that towers above you as you attempt to work your way through them, populated by more elaborate puzzles and a ridiculous number of hidden collectibles to find. Everything that Tomb Raider is known for has been improved and taken on a new scope, but in a similar vein, all the has been wrong with the series for years has been entirely neglected.Combat, though moderately improved, is still as mindless and unsatisfying as ever. The camera continues to be your worst nightmare, seemingly out to make navigating through levels a living hell and often sending you jumping off in entirely the wrong direction. Numerous frustrating glitches make themselves known throughout, from harmless bugs to aggravating mishaps that make progression incredibly difficult. Most disappointing though is how the level designs can often get ahead of themselves, leaving you scratching your head at the enormous size of them without the slightest idea where to begin. The hint system certainly helps in this regard, but it's an imperfect solution, and ideally one you shouldn't ever need to rely on.If you have ever played a Tomb Raider game before though, none of this should surprise you. As I said before, Crystal Dynamics has built up what the series does best, while quietly ignoring its issues perhaps hoping they'll be overshadowed or ignored. Personally I'm more than capable of putting up with these annoyances in exchange for the rest of the experience, but I'm definitely beginning to ask myself why I'm OK doing this, or if I should have to (the answer for which is obvious). If you didn't enjoy Legend or Anniversary you will find nothing more to draw you into Underworld, but for those who have yet to tire of Lara's escapades Underworld provides a fitting final chapter in this particular story of her life, if also a signal that it's probably time to move onto something new.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Tomb Raider: Underworld takes you on an adventure through Norse mythology to find the lost island of Avalon. Beautiful levels, fun gameplay, exploration, and amazing visuals make this game a beloved addition to the series and truly worthy of the name Tomb Raider.Gameplay+ Puzzles+ Fun traversal/climbing+ Beautiful variety of levels and locations+ Easy combat+ Thor's hammer!- Puzzles can be irritating when you have to pick up items- Repetitive and sometimes frustrating combatUnderworld is like all the other Tomb Raider games in terms of gameplay. The puzzles are fun and challenging, the climbing and traversal is great, and the variety of levels, locations, and environments are amazingly well done. Combat is still the same simple lock on with right click and hold left click to shoot Thor's hammer was fun to use though, and while this is easy it can get quite boring and repetitive Plus those ****ing spiders are annoying as hell!. If you liked the gameplay in previous Tomb Raider games you will enjoy this one just as much. The main issue however, lies with the puzzles. Like other games you have to pick up a weight and set it down on a switch, this is nothing new. However a lot of times the game glitches and will either throw Lara far back, or more often than not, Lara and the block fly around the room making it just irritating to set them down on a switch.Controls/Camera+ Easy controls+ Easy combat- Frustrating camera placements- Unresponsive controls at timesAgain, the controls and camera are exactly like Legend and Anniversary. They are easy to learn and do what you need to do, but sometimes Lara simply doesn't do what you want her to do and while it's frustrating it isn't gamebreaking. The main problem with games like these (Tomb Raider, Uncharted, basically any game with traversal and climbing) is the camera placement. It just isn't always where you need it to be to see where you're going and again, it can be quite irritating that you miss jumps and have to restart because the camera.Audio/Visual+ Gorgeous levels+ Variety of locations+ Water well done- Graphical glitchesThe levels and locations in Underworld are well-done in quality and quantity. You travel all around the world, see different places and architecture, and the parts where you are underwater are just beautiful to be in and explore. There is the occasional graphic glitch but nothing gamebreaking, she will get stuck in the ground a few times but if you simply stop moving it normally fixes itself.Story/Dialogue+ Engaging story+ Interesting history and mythology+ Nice lengthI thoroughly enjoyed the story in Underworld which revolved around Norse mythology, mainly Thor. It was interesting, informative, engaging, lengthy and overall was enjoyable to play throughout the whole game.Overall/Quick ReviewUnderworld is an amazing addition to the Tomb Raider series and is worth your time. It has an engaging story line with history and mythology of excellent length. A variety of challenging puzzles, climbing, and traversal in an array of beautiful locations, none looking quite like the other. The combat, in my opinion, gets boring and repetitive as it is simply hold right click to lock on and left click to shoot while dodging and flipping. The main issue I had with this game was some of the puzzles took longer than they should have because graphical glitches cause weight blocks to shoot off the switch and to the other side of the room. However the underwater levels are some of the best times in this game and are simply breathtaking.Wonderful addition to the Tomb Raider series.Buy it. 9/10 ",55,6,0,7,4,0,2

												Underworld picks off right after the events in Legend. Lara is on the quest to uncover the truth about what happened to her mother Amelia Croft, and in order for that she must find a way to reach Avalon, a place only Gods are suppose to enter. In order to gain entrance there, Lara must track down the artifacts that once belonged to the norse God Thor, and these artifacts are scattered throughout the world, and hide secrets of their own. Her quest will come at a great loss, in order to find the truth about her mother, she could unleash a terrible evil upon the world. That is the story in a nutshell, and without spoiling anything. The gameplay is good, but not perfect. Camera angles get in the way sometimes, and the controls are a little too sensitive. The weapon fighting could have had a little more polishing, but it is easy enough to handle on most occasions, however, none of these minor flaws get in the way of enjoying this game.The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, but I did find them a little more simple than in previous Tomb Raider games. The action and exploration are very well done, and the locations of the levels are sometimes breathtaking, from Coastal Thailand, to Southern Mexico to the Artic, this game delivers in spades on the visual department. It's a game with a  few years, but the visuals still manage to impress. The textures are all high quality, and so is the animation and particle system, everything you walk on or touch releases debry and smoke. Crystal Dynamics went all in when it comes to detail. Music is absolutely phenomenal. Orchestrated compositions fill the action nicely, and some tunes are truly remarkable. The sound effects are also at a high level, and another point of mention is the voice acting, which is believable and not over acted as sometimes happens. Highly recommended game. The Good-Great Story, Music, Graphics and Sound Effects-Varied locations, makes exploration a joy-Animation is particularly life-like and impressiveThe Bad-Camera gets in the way sometimes-Weapon fighting could have used some more polishing-Sensitive controls (mouse too sensitive) easily adjustable through the options screen (to a more personal preference), or by adjusting the DPI on your mouse, if you have one. 8.5/10			",178,3,6,3,4,0,2

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*The third Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics. After some consideration and despite its flaws, I still recommend this game for fans of the franchise.Even though the puzzles and level design is no where near as good as in Anniversary (allthough Core is responsible for that one) it is still a solid game.My main gripe with this is the camera. It constantly adjust itself as if it was a ballon being dragged behind a running kid. So it will always pull toward the center trying to get Lara in the center of the screen. This will make her block your view. Typically you would want your character in the bottom half of the screen to get a full view of the battlefield. In this game you have to constantly pull on your mouse to do so. Annoying.The camera is also trying to be ""intelligent"" and rob you of the control at times which can be annoying. Personally I'm not too bothered with that, but it is a bit worse here than in previous games.Other than that, Tomb Raider: Underworld is an enjoyable game.			",279,118,12,29,18,2,44

												This game is the best one of the series up to the remake in my opinion, and especially fans of south-american, and norse mythology will get more than their money's worth out of this. The graphics can still compete with many comparable games today, and will demand higher system specs than you would estimate.I will say this though: If you are familiar with the ""old school"" Tomb Raider games, the game's puzzles will be smooth sailing for you. The game is fairly easy and you always have the feeling of being Superior to your enemies, however the landscapes, architecture, and atmospherical beauty in every single location makes this game a must-have for not only Tomb Raider fans, but also graphic afficianados, RPG fans, and intricate story lovers.I rate this game with 4 of 5 possible stars, but only because of its easy predictabillity when familiar with the franchise			",191,39,2,18,4,1,5

												Tomb Raider Underworld is the 9th installment in the TR series. This game holds true to the founding principles of the original titles. Tomb Raider Underworld has stunning visuals from Laura herself to the environments. Underworld's story is good enough to keep you interested as you make your way through the game. Enemies that you encounter are all but menacing as you mow them down with your dual-wielded pistols in a very basic combat system. The camera at times feels like a more formidable foe as you jump from ledges to your doom as a result from some awkward camera shift.Even though Underworld has minor flaws, there wasn' t enough to kill the experience. The game overall felt complete and fun to play. A solid 4 out of 5.			",70,3,2,4,1,0,1

												Excellent game, though the port to PC is a tad buggy.there is the usual ""Lara why did you jump that way?"" that occurs in all the games on all the platformsand then the menu was very buggy when using the mouse, i often times found it best to avoid clicking in the menuse and to just use the space bar and escape key to navigateExcellent solve-it-yourself puzzle game, great if you're a fan of games like portal that have the difficulty of a 27x27 sudoku board, with the game spaing little, if any hints. I personally managed to make it through needing only to look at a walkthrough once, and it beame clear that i knew what i had to do but i didn't know how to make lara do it. literally one point in the entire game, a ledge-to-wall chimney jump that gave no indication of lara recognizing it and seemed to devote itself to making me jump in the wrong direction whenever attempted until i found the sweet-spot in the walkthrough. now, about the in-game hints,generally helpful, though towards the end the standard ""what do i do"" observation becomes a lot more clear than the hints, not because it is easier to understand, but because it essentially restates the hints with more information. this point starts around the latter half of the mexico level.somewhat predictable story, though with the AAA games on the market nowadays people's intuition into story narratives has really been narrowed down to a very basic level, so if you don't play story-driven games that often or play mostly AAA games, the story will blow your mind, otherwise you will be able to predict a general amount of what will happen, which isn't always a bad thing. still worth playing, even if you do accidentally spoil it for yourself.Puzzles will grant you hours of gameplay, while combat will grant you mere minutes. DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR THE COMBAT. the combat system is based on an extremely strong aim-assist that puts the standard crosshaire somewhre in front of Lara's chestal-region, without bothering to make the camera go to a better angle or making Lara transluscent. the aim-assist is clearly designed for consoles, and will feel a bit too snappy to different targets, which can be a real turn off if you want to focus on a a specific enemy, and the end of the game essentially turns into easy-mode. you'll know what i mean. It becomes so easy, that the developers chose instead of balancing the onsters, to just throw hundreds of the biggest enemies straight into the slaughter that is one very angry Lara Croft. Again, the combat will last you minutes of actual gameplay, and be a cause of about .0001% of your deaths.all in all, this is my favourite Tomb Raider game, on a scale including several different things i find important when playing a game. Disclaimer, i've only ever played Underworld, AoD, Legends, and 2013. ( order to play is AoD -> Legends -> Underworld, you don't need to finish the camplaigns, just the first few levels in legends and the opening cutscenes in AoD for the background story and references found in Underworld)cotrol responsiveness: 8.5/10camera-not-get-in-the-way-ness: 9.5/10 (PC port issue only tho)Story: 8/10, a bit cheesy but hey, Lara is like Batgirl and Catwoman mixed together with Batman's wealth and gadgetspuzzle CHALLENGE: 9/10, very balanced, though some parts will stump you on sheer mechanical issues, as they did mepuzzle DIFFICULTY: 5/10, most of the puzzles are actually straightforward, but not very intuitive once you figure them outFun: exhillerating when you complete a difficult puzzle, and when you complete several in a row without thinking too much you feel empowered, but it slowly luls you into a boredom, but that will be interupted by a cutscene, or a new mechanic, or an enemy, and bam, all of a sudden you are thrust out of the puzzle mindset and have to actually think again, making you frustrated, but eventually repeating the cycle. Drama: catfights. literally that's about it.Action: QTEs are unweildy and counter-intuitive in most cases, thank goodness they were left out for the most part. Combat is bleh, basicaly you just choose how easy it is to die when selecting difficulty and then just shoot the enemies before they hit you for the same effect on any difficulty levelspoopiness: not much, some levels give you that fear of the unknown, or helplessness, but nothing realy spoopy about itEngaging: very engaging, even if it makes you ragequit, you will pick it, or another Tomb Raider title up within a month of setting this one downCompatability: Playing on a 1.7GHz 4-core processor with 8GB RAM and a 768MB APU, this game ran surprisingly well on maximum graphics, though on a port there isn't much to change, but be careful when tabbing out, as this will cause lag spikes that will drop you from 60 FPS to about 5 FPS for anywhere between 30 seconds and 7 minutes. Don't panic if the loading screen freezes up, it only crashed on me once during loading, and upon restarting never game me the issue again. Later in the game, Attempting to manual save would sometimes crash the game, thankfully after the save. this was never a real problem for me as it usually occured when i was planning to *gasp* get off my computer /(*O*)\ and would save me the trouble of having to quit out myself. interestingly enough, a save game 5 minutes prior with n major progression or tabbing out would save normally, without crashing.V-Sync Recommended for more powerful computers. Works great on Win 8.1, unlike it's predescessors.great game, great graphics, great physics, great puzzles, most interesting story in the series, no weird fixation on torturing, beating, and killing Lara in frankly quite sociopathing ways *cough looking at you 2013* and actually did a lot of it's homework on Norse mythology (before adding artistic licsense of course)i would recommend this game before any other in the Tomb Raider series if you wanted to play from start to finish, as it is a great examply of the free-run and puzzle origins of the series, instead of being some ""Appeal to everyone"" flashy new thing that really holds no actual homage to the core of the series whlst attemting to create it's own origin story based on combat.

												It's good but...I bought the game as a pack on a sale. As a long time fan of the franchise, this is a solid title. For those who never played the series before, here are some things you need to know. First, this isn't the Tomb Raider from the reboot. The gameplay is a bit different, a little less cinematic in it's story telling but the game is still an eye candy that will make you stop to look at the scenery despite it being a little graphicaly outdated. It is overall a good game and I recommend it.That said, here are some of the issues that you may want to know. Because of its age, it is highly unlikely that there will be any new patches to fix it. First, the framerate. The framerate throughout the game is not stable. You will often find yourself with slowdowns under the 20fps mark. If this occurs to you, alt+tab out for a second and returning will usually fix the issue until it happens again. Secondly, I encountered a few crashes during my gameplay. Due to varying fps, I'm assuming it might be due to a few memory leaks. It's a bit annoying but only occured about 3 times during my playthrough. Then there are a few minor issues that I encountered along the way such as invisible collision (may annoy you if you are also the type to explore everywhere), a few camera collision and odd angles, a few streaming issues (unloaded textures until you are right against the object, possible issue if you are a speedrunner). The issues stated above may break the immersion and lessen the appreciation for the game but the overall experience is still enjoyable. I recommend this title if you feel like revisiting the franchise or want to see experience the series pre-reboot.			",85,22,1,4,5,2,1

												An overall fun platforming-action-puzzle-shooter.I've played Mirror's Edge so I'm used to the old ""dying and retrying"" trial and error way the game works. You'll die, a lot. But it's mostly caused by bad grab/jump point marking on the developers part. If you go slow and are deliberate in your joystick movements you'll learn the mapping pretty well. The combat system does get wonky when there are more then two enemies on the screen. I recommend equipping the right secondary gun for certain enemy types to help stun them to buy more time for dogging around. Shotgun up close to knock back quick movers or leapers helps. The puzzles do not hold your hand in any way. If you need a hint you can look in the in-game journal but how you accomplish it is up to you to figure out. No detective vision here. But I found most puzzles to be fun and some were a blast to figure out.The music was fantastic. Each environment had its own theme and the ques for any sort of action or discovery were always on point. The story was good. I cant help feeling at the end of the game though that some key details were being left out. Or were rushed over in the story. In the end I didn't feel it concluded but wanted to tell me more and just, ran out of time. I have played this game twice and got just as much fun out if it the second time as the first.

												This is my first Tomb Raider since the 2013 Tomb Raider was more of a Action focused game reminding me a lot of Last of Us, Underworld definitely kept to the original Tomb Raider formula, but greatly improved. This was a very very good game, the levels , the puzzles, and graphics are all incredible. The overall gameplay was fun and challenging, It has that Portal effect, when you pass all the challenges and confusion you feel very proud of yourself. I had a lot of fun playing through the game with some fustration but the whole experience was a good one. But I do have to bring up some of the horrible things in this game, there are a lot of bugs/glitches that plague this game. There were many times where Lara would get stuck in places, you step in a certain area and you can no longer move, I had to use the grapple hook just to get out. There are some camera issues, graphical glitches, and some very weird times where Lara would go right through the ledge/grab point where she wouldn't grab it, she would just go through it. I recommend this to anybody who is interested in the classic style of Tomb Raider, the good far outweigh the annoyances.			",160,15,5,16,4,0,8

												PROS:- THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!  OK now that I've got this out.......- A ton of CINEMATIC gameplay and cutscenes including plot major twists- Drop-dead gorgeous graphics- Atmospheric score and realistic sound effects- Varied and immersive environment and level design- Intuitive (and improved) swimming mechanics- Lara's physical capabilities are much more realistic- Improved inventory system- Darker and less comical tone- Smooth and natural animations for Lara and secondary chacracters- Lara is an eye candy to look at regardless of viewing anglesCONS:- Earlier levels being too easy; overall difficult not as challenging as Anniversary- Frequent crashes during game saving (thankfully save files are not corrupted)- Random frame rate drops, likely due to memory leak; this is solved by ALT-TAB in / out- Occasional poor physics (largely resolved by turning on VSYNC)- Legend and Anniversary had instant loading; Underworld levels usually take 5-10 seconds..- Many more treasures (artifacts), but also much harder to find especially in open sea levels.- Lara now has occasionally wrinkles on her forehead----why?  Unecessary IMOEasily the best TR game I've played thus far; it grants an enormous sense of satisfaction as you progress through puzzles and platforms and more importantly, PLOT.  Yes, for the first time in a TR game, the plot is actually intriguing and captivating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You need to tweak some GFX card settings before launching the .exe to get this game to run the way it was made to. Most importantly to turn V-Sync ON, with the port from console to PC you need to nerf the FPS for the ingame physics engine to behave the way it was designed to. A lot of people don't give this game a chance because they ran a buggy game without really optimizing the settings. If you run this game above 60 FPS then it will perform very poorly with twitchy gameplay.I love this game and this is what Tomb Raider should really be about. Not killing deer to craft handbags or making a one-time campfire, or lamenting over tear-jerking drama. TR:U is full of puzzles but like it's predeccesor (Legend) it was rather short; I reached final boss in approx. 8 hours. There are still lots of places to explore and find secrets for replay value. I liked the new engine especially with the now-added gimmick to rock climb up a wall. Human combat was a bore but thankfully there are only two levels with it. If you like the original Tomb Raider games then you'll love TR:Legend, TR:Anniversary, and TR:Underworld (in that order).It's a shame that Crystal Dynamics felt the need to reboot Lara into a ""hyper-realistic"" girl-next-door. We were really approaching something great with TR:U. Instead of rebooting into a ""Last of Us"" copy, they should have just taken the AC:Black Flag route with an open-world tomb-raiding experience and a pulled-back camera. R.I.P this future series.

												A decent entry in the Tomb Raider series, but no more than “average” overall.The story and atmosphere are decent but not great. Most of the gameplay is puzzle platforming. This sometimes gets a bit repetitive, but there is enough variation and cutscenes to prevent it from getting too tedious. The balance between platforming and other types of gameplay is better than in TR-Anniversary (which was all platforming) but maybe not quite as engaging for the masses (and me) as the 2013 reboot (which had more action). The platforming difficulty is generally good for most of us, but on the easy side for hardcore gamers. I struggled with some parts, but always got through after a while. Some environments look really nice (Thailand), but others have rather bare and bland level design. The combat is fairly bad, as expected with this series. The checkpoint save system is also annoying, but not too bad.Though some of the veterans will scoff, I find the optional “field assistance” hints an improvement over the previous games that offered no help at all - now I am less likely to need to look up solutions online when I get stuck. There is still big room for improvement in this area though. At least there are difficulty settings for specific things like enemy health and fall damage.Lara's controls are a bit mixed. In some ways they are fine, but they also feel a bit nervous and she moves less natural (less inertia and animation flow) than in TR-Anniversary. As usual, sometimes the controls don't do what you want, causing many accidental deaths. Also, the camera behaviour can be disorienting, and the FOV is unpleasantly low. At least there is no mouse acceleration. The HUD is bad - you have to open your PDA to change weapon and see how much ammo you have. None of these flaws are game breaking though.Tip: To improve the graphics beyond the max ingame settings, i suggest forcing AF to x4 (ingame AF setting does not work) and AA transparency  to 4x supersampling in nvidia control panel.I would say this is a game to get when on sale, and only if you are ok with a lot of puzzle platforming.

												TL;DR it's a good game with some fun platforming and adventure, but with annoying, frustrating combat.  Best played with a controller.The game's platforming is overall pretty fun, but it suffers from a LOT of problems.  Namely in the chamber where you'll get Thor's Belt.  Okay, so you get an item called Thor's Gauntlet.  It lets you move certain blocks for puzzle purposes.  In this particular instance, you move a pillar so you can jump onto it later.  The problem is that it's a damn lie.  Even if you try and jump on it (which would save you a lot of time and frustration) Lara decides that she doesn't want to grab the ledge, so you plummet to your death.  In fact, the platforming overall is pretty iffy.  More than once I’ve had to do the same exact jump twice, because Lara decided not to grab the ledge that time. If you're hanging from a ledge, you can only rotate the camera 90 degrees to either side of her, meaning you can't look directly behind her to see where you're going to be jumping.  She plays a special hanging animation when the jump is safe, but it’s really dumb that you can’t just LOOK.  The worst enemy you will fight in this game is the camera.  It is WAY too close to Lara, and it is WAY too jumpy.  Fighting any melee enemy, once they close the distance, the camera just goes bonkers.  I’ve actually fought enemies before where the camera doesn’t even look at them, it decides that the ceiling is a better place to be looking.Elaborating on the combat, a lot of the enemies are bullet sponges.  There are some in particular who are especially annoying, though.  Giant spiders are the worst ones I found.  They have a lot of health (even with enemy HP set to low) and they have a leap attack that has hardly any telegraphy.  They kind of shake their abdomen for half a second, then they leap at you.  Even if you see this in time, and decide to dodge, there are no invincibility frames.  The spiders leap way too quickly, so unless you dodge BEFORE they telegraph their attacks, you’re not going to get out of the way fast enough.This game is very, VERY buggy, too.  Maybe it’s because it’s from 2008, and it can’t deal with Windows 7, and newer graphics cards.  But in any case, it can lead to your death more than once.  I’ve had times where I get stuck entirely and I have to reload a save.The game does not play nicely with a mouse and keyboard, so I recommend playing it with a controller.  It’s still not perfect, however. ",222,15,2,16,17,2,17

												pros: varied and expansive environmental design, some puzzles are challenging and well designed, soundtrack fits the theme, all the women in this game look like hot ♥♥♥♥♥escons: derpy camera angles, clunky movement and controls, you can't directly select which rings you want to grapple/rope, boring story plot and underwhelming ending, terrible supporting characters, combat is basic and repetitive, and some puzzles I found wasn't executed very well.Overall, you will find Lara doing actions that you didn't want her to do because of clunky controls and derpy camera angles, causing you to die countless times. There is also no shortage of transformers buildings for your viewing pleasure. Although the execution of this game may be flawed, what it offers has value.Tomb Raider: Underworld has my recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the very first TR game that I have completed from beginning to end and considering the experience I had it's certainly not the last one. I love almost every single thing about this game.The setup and the overall atmosphere is either beautiful or epic and while the story itself is not the greatest thing, the gameplay is solid, the soundtrack is friggin' genius and the puzzles are well designed (they're not super easy, but they're not annoyingly hard either).The only not awesome thing that I can note about this game is that the camera is occasionally acting up HOWEWER even when it does, the devs built in a function which fixes it almost immediately. Don't move a muscle for around 5 seconds and the camera fixes it's position automatically.Onward to Helheim, I say!P.S.: I also bought the 360 version and it's DLC content separately, because I enjoyed this game that much. No regrets, just pure awesomeness.			",92,19,1,1,5,0,6

 TOMB RAIDER: UNDERWORLD REVIEW When I got this, I first thought it wasnt gonna support my native resoloution of 2560 x 1440p, as of a game of this age would not be optimsed for a high resoloution as the happens with other games of the same age. But im glad I was wrong. It optimes it for my resoloution with decent graphics for its time and rarely bugs. A issuing bug However sometimes the game dips to 5-10 fps and stays like that, meaning you have to restart the game, but this is the only major bug I have encountered. Other people's problems People have claimed that this game is reptitive and buggy with bad optimisation - claiming it has poor camera angles and very buggy. None of this occurs wiht me however its different for everyone so watch out for this. My rig Im running  Tomb Raider: Underworld  at  60fps  on a  AMD R9 390  and a  Intel-I5 6600k  with  Windows 10  Overall statment In my opinion, I really like this game and it isnt very buggy and more of an adventure/action game instead of a typical puzzle Tomb Raider game, which you prefer is your opinion but I prefer an action type of game.

												A very nice episode of the Tomb Raider series which puts an end to the story started with Legend. I liked the graphics and the gameplay, but the game itself was too short. Sadly the DLCs remain Xbox 360 exclusive, I'm envy at the Xbox players when I watch the gameplay videos on YouTube. I feel like the developement was rushed as I noticed some bugs, but they weren't horrible, I could finish the levels without serious issues.I say, recommended.			",119,22,2,17,16,2,42

												This is best game in the trilogy, but its overall improvements are small. Each game in the trilogy improves upon the previous game, but the improvements are gradual.If you play this trilogy from start to finish, then you'll probably feel the third and last game is getting repetitive. If you play the third game by itself, then it will feel a lot more fresh and entertaining. The third game gives a good summary of the events from the previous two games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review by xTzharkz.Tomb Raider : Underworld. Shortly: Great story, nice puzzles, good graphics, so so character movement, bad item (box) interactions.The story was built up perfectly. After playing Tomb Raider: Legend the story kept going, which worked for me, I was actually hoping for it. Seems like the previous storylines were all related to each other. But after finishing this one I don't see it going anywhere from here. Will see what Anniversary has to offer but I think it ended. Great story. Puzzles were not too hard but nice to figure them out. So it kept the mood up to keep playing, not to quit cuz rage or something like that. Also if got lost, no idea what to do, can ask for hint under Tab, which was nice. They had this relic hunt in there as well but since there were so many of them and they were really tiny it didn't work for me. Had no mood to look all of them. If had 3 in each chapter and something bigger would had been nicer.Combat system was kind of boring. New enemies which was nice but there was no challenge killing them. It was same in previous game as well. So yeah, they have still improvement space in that area. Secondary weapon was kind of useless, they let you choose one at the beginning of each chapter but ended up never using them. She had on autoaim that had 100% acc so yeah. Lots of tiny spiders came. If 10 then just 10 shots and done. No challenge, kind of pointless to add them then at all. Also her kick was so op. No matter what enemy got close, kick them, they fall on floor, shoot, if they still not dead, kick again as soon as they stand up. Graphics improved hellalot comparing to previous game(s). Lot of more little details, surroundings. I was really bothered by character movement. The speed of her actions were really off to me. Looked really odd. All wall climbings, jumping, you name it. Got stuck in the at between places and had to reload or kill myself with nades to continue. Also the interactions with items such as boxes, placing them on the pressureplates were very glitchy. Press E to pick up cube, it flew off nowhere or she went underground and appeared again. Placing cube on the pressureplate, it flew of as soon as touched it. So had to find that not glitchy spot on it. Overall, game was great. I am recommending it with both of my hands. But you should play previous ones first. Otherwize story is kind of off.xTzharkz [Eric]			",17,3,0,2,0,0,1

												Simply the most exquisite, lush, beautiful, immersive, entertaining, captivating, engaging, intricate, beautiful (did I say that already?) Tomb Raider excluding the Newest ""Tomb Raider.""  The water level was phenomenal.  Lara has never been so gorgeous.  This is without question worth 9$, even despite one particular puzzle string that can bug (look it up) but not at all often and didn't with me; I was just confused and thought it did, surprised when I read it actually could.  The puzzles are a lot less ridiculous than the old-school TR's in that there's a lot less BS like hunting for unending hours for a switch that's camouflaged exactly the color of a wall whereupon finding it you either feel the absolute thrill of success or feel unaccomplished like you just spend the past several hours on a worthless easter egg hunt getting older and deader.  Underworld, TR 2, TR 3, and the new TR are the gems IMHO.			",150,1,2,25,0,0,22

With a fantastic balance of yesteryear's tech requirements, and wonderful deisgn and graphics for the day, it will play well on most older PC's. You say you don't have a big beefy expensive video card in your rig? This may be perfect for you. Enjoy all of the action, adventure, exploration, and puzzle solving that the TR franchise offers with this magnificient rpg / work of art.			",37,6,1,3,5,1,2

												Based on what other people have said about how ""bad"" this game is, I have to seriously disagree with that. I don't understand how this game is considered bad whatsoever! Graphics don't make a game, its the game's story-line and characters that makes the game what it is! Yet every now and then I see dorks who think graphics is what makes a game or just because they can't pass something they say its a bad game. Even though the game ""starts"" you off without a tutorial it actually teaches you tips and such along the way. If you need help with jumping and figuring out puzzles isn't that what walkthroughs are for? If you want to figure it out yourself keep trying until you get it or take a break and try again later. The Tomb Raider games obviously are for people who have to eventually stop and think on how to solve something in particular. I really enjoyed most of this series and I haven't finished the whole thing. The only issue I had with the game is the fact that there was so much water!!! I liked the classic running around, jumping on things, and not having to swim a whole lot. But other then that I seriously enjoyed the game!!! Just as I think I'll enjoy all the others.One thing Eidos hasn't mastered in Tomb Raider is the Human Vs Lara Combat. The combat usually feels clunky & unrealistic. basically stupid AI. But, before you look away and agree. The main thing is that this game prefers that you do a bunch of fancy moves, tumble around, and take them out quick. Do that fancy new kick in the groin then headshot in slow motion LOL. The better you are at this the more fun the experience. As for Animal AI it is better, but you will notice its flaws as well. There is also clipping problems for NPC & Lara alike. The story is interesting though, and the environments too amazing to pass up. Unfortunatly you do run into invisible walls, especially in the ocean, but most of them are hard to reach and find out about anyway. If you like to adventure more than you like combat, which is at the core of Tomb Raider series, you love exploring this world. new controls can be painful at times. I suggest a PC gamepad, if you can find a good one. I still like Anniversary the most, as far as story & gameplay			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												To keep this short and simple, since very few if anyone will read it, and I tend to ramble and rant randomly, I'll simply list a few ways this title compares with similar games, from my perspective.I have played most of the TR games since the original on the playstation.  I always enjoy them to at least some extent, but often gave up on finishing them, rather than look up walkthroughs and strain my eyes and/or nerves for hours and hours.This game, however, I truly enjoyed.  I watched part of one video walkthrough, because of confusion, but it was my mistake as I simply wasn't fully aware of the inventory system (since I had the item the entire time, but am quite used to notifications these days.)  I played on the easiest difficulty, but that almost exclusively affects combat.  The new functions available made the fighting even easier at times, but also tempting to fool around with, resulting in Lara's untimely demise more than a few times.  To be honest, I tend to dislike the combat systems of tomb raider games most of the time, but looking back I can clearly state that if they had always had some of these abilities in earlier titles, especially the dedicated melee/spinkick/jumpkick/etc, I would have enjoyed them all much more.  To me, the best parts of this ""original/non-reboot"" Tomb Raider series, was the adventure aspect.  Earlier titles varied greatly in their adventure/puzzle/combat ratio(s) but never quite like this game.  Some was frustrating, even a couple parts that took dozens of attempts, but the issues were mainly my own.All things considered, the puzzles were quite easy, levels often quite linear, and plot twists that weren't often surprising.But the most important thing about each of those ""negatives"" is if you are comparing this game with others that specialize in one or two aspects.  Despite simplicity at times, the puzzles often required thought, patience, and were fun.  Any ""linear"" issues are irrelevant to me for this game, as it was more of an interactive movie, not an open world RPG.  And the story, despite it not being perfect, and often described as anti-climactic, felt more real and understandable than some big end fight.    tl;dr. enjoy it for what it is.

												Maybe the last real Tomb Raider game. I used to desribe this one as a mixture between Anniversary (= enhanced classic Tomb Raider gameplay with a heavy emphasis on exploration and environmental puzzles) and Legend (= a more streamlined action experience like Prince of Persia or Uncharted series). It's a must play for any true TR-fan and it offers the most engaging story yet (until Tomb Raider Reboot next year 2013).			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												I loved this game. I have the other two in the trilogy - Anniversary and Legend. However, this one is for the PC, my others for PS2. To compare them:Story is best in Underworld, but also great in Legend. Anniversary I found did not have enough story, with a basic plotline, but I get it was a remake of a classic. There's always something happeneign in Underworld, cutscenes in every level. So many surprises in Underworld, and I like that it takes a darker turn. Rewards are not as good. There are a larger amount of treasures to find than in Legend, but I can't remember in comparison to Anniversary (are there more in Anniversary?). The rewards are all concept art and character designs. No unlockable outfits, bringing me to ...Outfits. Smallest selection available in the trilogy. You cannot 'unlock' any, but the selection is available from the start. At each level you are given a choice of 2 - 3 outfits corresponding with the location (you can't play with winter clothes in Thailand).Graphics are amazing. I love the difference. I'm not usually one interested in graphics, but this changed me. I don't know if it's just PC vs PS2, but they helped so much for me. Seeing Amanda again with better graphics really changed the game for me. Although, seeing Lara in some scenes she looks so much older!Moves have definately been improved. Lara is able to do more with the controls. More jumps, climbs, etc. Fantastic, everywhere. She can now walk/balance on the poles you only used to swing on. Weapons are interesting. With the entire selection available from the start, unlike outfits you can use them all anywhere. They all (except her classic pistols) have limited ammo, and ammo cannot be found throughout the level.Levels are a good length as well. They are fairly restricted (corridor levels), but it's better than Legend. Longer than Legend, not as big as Anniversary. Overall, this one is my favourite. I couldn't decide between this or Legend, but this is great. The story is so intense and exciting, even though ocassionally predictable, I liked it. It tied together all loose ends, and didn't leave anything hanging. The level replay style is quite different to Legend and Anniversary becuase once you have played all levels, you revisit them exactly as you left them so there are no more enemies (except regenerative ones) and the puzzles are all already solved. This is the Treasure Hunt mode. If you want to replay a level with story as it was originally, you have to reload it from the load option within the game.  You have to play the other two first becuase the story won't make sense (although you may get away with not playing Anniversary...). There is less human fighting than Legend, but there is some. You mostly have to shoot spiders and bats. I would recommend this to any gamer, particularly if you like a good plot, action, combat, adventure, quiet solo play or Lara Croft. Only negatives would be restricted outfit selections and the rewards.			",4,2,0,0,3,0,0

												I prefer more action-oriented games (i.e. Uncharted series). But this was an enjoyable change of pace because as expected, it's more about solving puzzles then shootouts like the Uncharted series.This game has nice graphics and design of environment, good sound, satisfactory cutscenes to make the story go along and make it not just seem like a game one puzzle solving level after another that I got from Tomb Raider Anniversary especially. Lara's movements are cool (e.g. melee kicking, able to jump off walls in tight spaces back and forth so it looks martial-arts like, can equip weapons instead of having to find them). There's a satisfactory amount of gun shooting in a game that is mostly puzzle solving and exploring. Norse mythology is used nicely as a plot point. And a big plus: the camera angles sometimes leads to Lara's nice♥♥♥♥♥ and you can choose her outfit and beginning of levels (her swimsuit in particular is eye-catching :p).Major gripes I have with this game: controls not 100% smooth (e.g. jumping to a moving object and she appears to have reached it but suddenly she drops to her death, and couple of times I was stuck in a random spot)And the camera auto adjusts so it gets really annoying trying to see your surrounding while moving.If this game was in the 100% yes or 100% no pile of games to play again, I would put this in the yes pile. I definitely found it more enjoyable than Tomb Raider Anniversary and Tomb Raider Legend.This game for me is a 8.5/10, a solid adventure game. ",45,3,0,4,2,0,1

												In my perspective I think that Tomb Raider Underworld is not a bad game and i think they should make an extra Game not ending at just THE 2013 Tomb Raider but also make an extra series and see how far the cast and crew members go with that idea. All in all my thoughts on the Tomb raiders are Terrific!, I couldn't hope for a better game than these ones, which are put in such extrodinary detail and great choosing of the characters to be put in the game. I want to give the cast and crew alot of thanks for making the game and hopefully they add more to the story in the game. Not only have I learned a vast amount of technique but learned also strategic obsticles and mind tricks too. The wepon of choice is outstanding then again the gun is kinda sad but more-less it's ok, and the Game is just FABULOUS is all I can say!, Have fun and keep coming up with more Tom Raiders in the future.

												9/10Each area is unique from the one before and after it.The climbing/puzzles range from easy, medium, and hard. Atleast 3 times I was stumped on what to do next but after looking around for a few minutes I was like, I wonder if that would work? I tried it and was like wow, I can't believe they were able to pull that off...only in Tomb Raider game right.The background story was good though I thought it was a little short. The ending just leaves you hanging. It felt like there should have been atleast one more area to finish the story.My only complaints are the camera glitches out at least once in every area, you just have to move around till you get the camera free. The game relies on auto saves and gives you the option to hard save. Every time I did a hard save it closed the game to desktop and I had to reload the game.

												The game is very good. I loved it.Lara kicks♥♥♥♥♥as per usual. Plenty of outfits for her to wear so that you can enjoy the game even more. But I've become so emotionally attached to Lara over the course of all these game that I would choose the one that would work best in the environment (warmer clothes for when its cold). I tried my best to keep her from dying because seeing her die made me sad. The guns are good but all I needed were the double pistols. But other weapons served me well.Puzzles are spot on and make you feel really good when you solved them. There were some places where it was just lost but figured out anyway. There are fewer bosses than usual though which is undewhelming sometimes.Also I have a complaint about the weapon system. You carry all the weapons but you choose one big gun that you can switch to from the double pistols. You don't need to earn them like before which is a shame.By the way there are too many treasures that would only onlock some concept art. Too bad there are no achivements or weapon upgrades that are given for collecting all the treasures and artifacts. This would make me want to play more and collect all of them. But for now only 14 hours of gameplay.Steam overlay does not work with this game so I had to use DS4W to make my controller work properly.Still, awesome game.			",135,9,0,6,0,0,2

												If you're a fan of the old-school Tomb Raider games, this is the last of that era.  No offense to the newer Tomb Raider games, but they just don't FEEL like Tomb Raider.  Tomb Raider should have very little combat, huge areas to get lost in, and the ability to make you want to throw your controller against the wall.Highly recommend this game along with Legend and Anniversary.

												This is probably the Tomb Raider I enjoy the most in the series.Graphics, puzzles and movements are pretty well (I speedrun this game, so I can tell movements aren't random).Camera is sometimes boring and the game has few technical issues such as random lags (Especially in the first area).As in every Tomb Raider games, don't look for a good story.The most disgusting thing is that DLCs (funded by Microsoft) are only available on Xbox 360.Anyway, This is overall a great game and i recommend it.

												So far I am really enjoying this entry, but I am old and played the originals when they came out. I have also already played 2013 and that being said never really felt like it was a true ""TR"" game, it just missed the mark for puzzles and vibes in my opinion. Underworld hits the nostalgia button just right, though I was sad to see they added the hints for people too lazy to figure it out for themselves. I've learned alot about Lara Croft during this adventure- mainly that she enjoys ancient tomato soup and playing D&D. Despite the glitches, clipping and dated graphics I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the series; unless you thought 2013 was amazing, then maybe you should just get Uncharted instead.

												This game is pretty fun, and if you are a fan of the Tomb Raider series or not, you will probably like it.The controls are smooth and easy to get used to, and the exploration is fun and challenging. Combat is easy to pull off as well. There is lots of treasure to be found and all kinds of secrets, so if you enjoy exploring, this game is for you.The graphics are beautifully rendered and pleasing to the eye, no matter what environment you're in. The story is simple enough for even a smaller child to understand, so don't worry about it being too hard to follow.Gear up and join Lara on her adventures to find treasure and fight her shadow today~			",61,13,2,5,5,0,1

												Buy the game if you are a fan of the series, if not: buy Tombraider: legend or something instead!+ Nice graphics for its time+ nice animations+ pretty good and interesting story+ contains challenging puzzles+ different climates+ improved combat system- 10 hours or less gameplay, some of them will be spend on the same action over and over again.- Lara will die an awful lot of times because of weird camera angles, low health in general or by failing to obey the gamers actions, combine this with badly placed checkpoints and you will be forced to repeat a whole bunch of actions over and over again, which can be very frustrating.I don't really know what to think of the game, I liked it because i played some games of the series in the past, but this one slightly dissapointed me... If you are considering to buy a game of these series for the first time, please look at other tombraider-titles before playing this one.**************************SPOILER ALERT********************************************-no bossbattles/anticlimax, The story builds up to the point that Lara has to aquire Thors hammer in order to defeat an evil goddes, after getting the hammer, Lara kills the goddes by simply throwing the hammer at her in a cutscene. The goddes instantly dies and her evil world-destroying tower falls apart haha, after that there is a vague reference to Tombraider Legend (excalibur) that doesn't make sense(to me) followed by the credits.

Introduction : Tomb Raider : Underworld , probably the only game that can make you puke .. literally ..(+)Graphics : Graphics are again improved comparing to Tomb Raider : Legend and Tomb Raider : Anniversary . This time we get to see even more detailed world and characters , you'll notice the difference as soon as the game starts .(~)Musics / Soundtracks :  Soundtracks are alright , but not as good as the earlier games . In the earlier games you could feel the adrenaline increasing as you jump on to the edges and ledges . Sadly i couldn't feel the same adrenaline playing while i did epic stuff .(+)Cutscenes :  Cutscenes have also increased to those of the earlier games . They are now better executed with the improved graphics and particle systems . (-)Story :  Story is not better to that of the Tomb Raider:Legend , nor it is different . It's literally the same thing , except this time you are looking for a different artifact .(+)Content :  The content is pretty much the same as the Tomb Raider : Legend . Nothing different here , Still the same old Lara Croft raiding tombs .(~)Gameplay :  Gameplay has been improved significantly . Here are some Pros and Cons ;PROS :   + You can now choose your weapons at the start of a level , or during the game by pressing ""Tab""        and opening your PDA.  + You can now scan your surrounding for the treasures or special items required to get past some   puzzles by using the newly added feature "" Sonar Map "".  + You can now use the Field Assistance by opening your PDA to get help when you are stuck at a   puzzle .CONS  - Grappling system has changed . You can no longer double press 'space' and automaticly grapple ,   you need to throw your grapple by pressing ""Q"" and then press space to hang . Which makes it really   difficult for fast grappling and moving .  - Camera .. It's horrible .. Look down below .  - ""You're not authorized to overwrite save files"" What ? you mean i can't overwrite my save files , i   need to just keep making new and new save files until i am out of them ?? What happens then ?     - Jumps off a 2 feet tall stone block , dies !!(-)Camera Controls :  Why ?? Why did you have to do this ??The Camera is simply HORRIBLE. Honestly it shakes off so much you'll be feeling dizzy and nauseous . I almost , ALMOST puked all over the damn pc because my head was about to explode when i finally decided to take a break after 30 minutes .When grabbing a ledge , dropping from a ledge , simply running , grappling , everywhere ! Everywhere it keeps shaking like a drunk cameraman is recording and it's unbearable .So yeah , Graphics , Soundtracks , Content , Gameplay all is well or at least bearable . But the camera is simply horrible and makes the game unplayable(for me at least) . Unless you are cross-eyed , then you should be fine .. If not , there is a high possibility that this game might make you one .4/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   ",113,13,3,7,3,1,10

This is review 3 of 3 in my Tomb Raider Legends timeline review series.Tomb Raider: Underworld has to be my favorite out of the three. Apart from the graphics, a lot of other things were updated quite nicely as well. The ability to have a variety of secondary weapons was a nice touch that I didn't think I needed. The inventory system is the cleanest and easiest to manage, especially with the elimination of the large and small health packs, and making it just one general health pack size. The HUD was simpler and the analog button commands also were boiled down to the basic extras like the binoculars, flashlight, weapon toggle, and health pack. This made controls simpler as well and didn't bog me down with so many button presses.Combat was so-so, and once you get the Mjolnir in the end-game, battles become like nothing. But it was still challenging in some areas, especially in the tighter corridors. Levels were generally much larger than in either of the first two. If in Legends you have small, easy to manage stages, and in Anniversary you had areas that connected to each other creating a seamless transition from level to level, Underworld brought levels of such massive size that the whole scale of things were beyond me. One stage had you climb up a tower with revolving sections (which arguably wasn't that tall, considering how fast you could finish that puzzle), while another was so large that you needed a motorcycle to get from one end of the area to the other. The entrance to the final area was located underwater, and you had to swim such lengths just to finish it.Despite the large areas though, traversing them never seemed like a long hassle. The obstacles along the way surely provided some break from the back and forth that was sure to happen, making sure that you were paying attention even in those parts.Underworld did a good job of wrapping up the connecting plots, even providing a short cinematic that I can only describe as a ""Previously on Tomb Raider..."" type of reel. Everything was resolved quite nicely, leaving just enough unresolved for a neat open ending for some issues.Not much to say here other than I loved it. I haven't played a good dungeon crawler in a while, and this was really fun to go through. I fully recommend this game. Best appreciated in order though, so play the first two before this one.

												I enjoyed the story and I really enjoyed the parkour type places in the game. They added a couple new jumping mechanics on top of the ones from tomb raider legend. The puzzles were well designed as I felt challenged, taking a while to figure them out, but no so frustrating that I wanted to give up.Here comes the big BUT.They didn't fix the terrible camera tracking while climbing. You often find yourself having to blindly jump backwards because the camera angle wont allow you to turn far enough to see where to jump to next.Also, a lot of the time throughout the climbing bits of the game I found Lara didn't respond to where I wanted to jump to and would often just jump off in some random direction resulting in a falling death. Which did get pretty frustrating, especially if you've been climbing for some time and been making progress.Overall, I enjoyed parts of the game, but it got pretty frustrating at some points with poor mechanics.

												If I had to describe this game with one word, it would be the word 'annoying'.I was so curious about the ending, but i don't have any patience left to complete the game.It's full of bugs, if you fall down after a long and annoying climb, (because Lara decides not to grab a ledge) you have to start it all over again. Like ALL OVER again. No safe ledges, no auto-save at vital points. The combat is boring (and annoying too, of course) there are these little enemies, like spiders and bats, that are a complete waste of time. Since Lara aims automatically, you just have to click, until they are gone. No aiming no point at all. On the other hand there are big enemies, that can take five to ten shotgun shots and you can't dodge their attacks,( there is a dodge button, but just like those little enemies, it is pointless) so the best is if you kick them to their deaths. That's the fastest way. The sad thing about it is that there is no end of these struggles. It's like the developers didn't care at all.There was this damn fine game called: Legend. Combat was fun, platforming was fun, it was a game you wanted to complete 100% and then play it again.Underworld is not that kind of game. I love the Tomb Raider series but it's a shame that this one is amongst them.Play Tomb Raider, play Tomb Raider: Legend, play Anniversary, but never play Underworld.Unless you want to have a nearvous breakdown.

												The Tomb Raider games from Crystal Dynamics are all solid and have their better and worse moments. This one is probably my favourite (Legend and Anniversary are also very good -- The Guardian of Light is great, and the new TR is amazing, too) of the trilogy, has fantastic levels that look absolutely gorgeous, its fun to play, the plaforming is enjoyable (your worst enemy is the camera tho), the combat is somewhat forgettable and the puzzles are good too. Good game, I recommend getting the lot on sale, absolutely worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GREAT game!  This is one of those I bought years ago and just never got around to playing.  It is MAD fun!  It's a lot different from your games of today, with not a lot of shooting.  It's more about exploring, solving puzzles, jumping from ledge to ledge, etc.  Also, if you have Nvidia 3D vision, you're in for a treat as this game is AWESOME in 3D.  I'm running at 85% depth, and there is very little ghosting, even on the outdoor stages.  Can't go wrong with this one!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game which looks like the start of a hentai comic! This game is perfect for guys who don't have a real girlfriend! Its cut scenes always emphasise Lara's asset e.g. her eyes! On a serious note ... I have enjoyed playing this game as I love the idea of Cliche action heros going through maze after puzzle after maze, though this game is repetive it gets away with it for being classic Tomb Raider!

												I really enjoyed this game! It’s come the closest to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. In some ways the exploration surpasses Prince of Persia. The ruins were a more complex and the controls lent themselves to lots of viable ways to traverse them. There was usually a single intended path but clever jumping would sometimes be rewarded. Unfortunately, this freedom also meant that there were lots of ways to die. I frequently jumped at the wrong places, or wrong moments, or just had the controls betray me as I tried to make a tricky jump. I also enjoyed the combat in this game. It was a lot less stressful than a third person shooter, and once I got the hang of the special abilities I found it be a good change of pace from the exploration. It was fairly easy, and I felt like a lot of the concepts were poorly explained, such as how ammo works with the special weapons.  ",441,201,13,59,37,6,77

												If you are TR fan, or just butt-cam fan, this might be good.Controls are clearly for a controller, camera is crappy (you can't see where to jump, what is directly in front of you or above you).I don't remember physics puzzles being so freaking broken. I literally spent 10 minutes placing 2 stones on a pressure plate.Gunfight mechanic is one of the worst. I had much easier time hitting enemies in old voodoo-powered intel 486 computer.Visually this game is good though, no major gamebreaking bugs. But you might sometime glitch through a wall and have to restart from a save.			",161,24,3,9,9,0,10

												So far, I've really enjoyed the Tomb Raider HD trilogy, and this entry is no exception. Polished and streamlined to a major degree, this game takes what makes the previous two games so good and ramps it up. The only thing I hate about this game is the spastic camera system and the rather disappointing finale. They don't ruin the game by any means, but they do hamper an otherwise fantastic game.Also, be prepared for a few bugs and glitches. There's nothing game-breaking, just issues with collision detection and Lara dying randomly, which ended up being more hilarious than inconvenient.			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

												I started playing tomb raider underworld on my old ps2, and fell in love, even though I was like 6. Since buying this again, I have to say, I am amazed on how well the game is optimised and how fun it is for a 2008 game. I am approaching the ending of the game, and I never want it to stop :(. I am definitely going to play the previous tomb raiders as my enjoyment when playing underworld was ""out of this world"" XD In conclusion, I rate this game 9/10 for it's brilliant story and well driven gameplay.

												It was without competition the worst gaming experience of my life. It literally felt like the team had done a brainstorm on how to create the most difficult user interface (UI) in the world, combined with the least generic game design the age has seen. The amount of frustration was so vast that I actually gave up at one point. Since most of the problems fall under couple of categories, it's very clear to see which developer team didn't do their job. On top it's a game about perfecting stupid keyboard commands, how fun is that?-------CONS-------Gameplay- It feels like an extremely poor adaption from console to PC. A true keyboard player's nightmare.- The climbing puzzles were challenging not because of difficulty but because of weirdly acting controls. I found myself doing the same puzzles over and over again just because the controls acted in a certain way one time and did something else the other time when i was in the very same situation.- Swinging on a rope is amazingly hard, sometimes it seems to work, other times not.- I spent 15% of time solving the puzzles and 85% to complete them due to broken controls.- Every jump in the game is an unforseen mystery how the controls are gonna react. I was half way through the game and still hadn't figured it out. - Overall controlling Lara doesnt feel smooth and natural.User interface- Gamesave process is confusing and time consuming. Manual saving is possible but useless because the game always loads from some place of itself not where you saved it.- Bad optimization: loading a savegame can take up as much time as loading from scratch.- Only some of the controls have defined key combinations in the options menu. For example it doesn't tell you how to throw an object or how to lower yourself on ropes.Game design- Worst example of inconsistent game rules. Time and again you could climb one type of crates but not others, leaving you baffled. Sometimes there would be ledges that seem so obvious a person could hold onto, yet Lara can't handle them. It just feels like the developer didn't hire a game designer.- Solutions to puzzles can come as out of the box. - The picking up of items/ breaking loot vases is time-consuming. Further more: I couldn't care less about the collectibles because they didn't seem to add anything to the game.- Lara can't interact with objects that scream to have this option. For example Lara is unable to open doors IN HER OWN HOUSE.Visual- Reversed design logic: the objects that are closest to you (Lara, motorcycle) have the simplest textures whereas the background environment is detailed and realistic.- 3d character models reflect a lack of anatomic knowledge.Bugs- Objects that allow interaction fly away when placed on the ground.--------------PROS--------------+ A peaceful soundscape that works great.+ The climbing puzzles are exciting when overlooking problems with controls.+ Background environments look rich and beautiful.+ Multi-aiming/ multi-shooting when more than one enemy is in range is original and smart.

												really, they've tested the controls of the game. You stuck literally everywhere. Pressing any direction key isnt working as expected in most situation where obstacles are near your charakter. Sometimes Lara just behaves as she is falling while standing on flat ground. Jumping onto legdes aint easy as well because most of the time Lara tries to wall-jump. Which is some sort of useless feature anyway.Especially the third person camera is really buggy and flipping around as there is a thunderstorm. In most situations it is impossible to take a look in that direction where you want to, which is nagging while climbing and trying to find the next possible spot.And in my point of view its kind of too much searching around, where you have to ascend/descend. It is occuping something like 98% of the whole game time.Edit:After completing first playtrough and played half of second one in highest difficulty I can only repeat my disregards for that game. The controls are even getting worse over time. It is impossible to get used to them. The producers where talking about something like ""freedom to do whatever you want to"". WTF, biggest lie ever. I cant do a sh... I cant go the ways I want to, Lara cant do the things she could every time... because the programmes want me to go ONLY ONE SINGLE WAY. They do not allow anything else, even if it seems plausible.But the camera is definitly the biggest pain in the a.. At no point in the game, you can look in that direction where you actually want to. So most of the time it is somehow playing blinded.And I have payed 9 bucks for that crap, that every first semester student of information science can do better...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks great, Lara looks gorgeous, and… that's about as much as i can say about the game, because i can't play any more of it. Why? The camera makes me sea-sick. That's saying a lot, because no game has ever made me as dizzy as this one, and i've been playing computer games for over 25 years.So what is it about the camera? In short, it has a life of its own. As soon as you hit any of the movement keys, the camera tries to level itself out and point towards where Lara is headed. The only way to stop this behaviour is to stop moving, But walking and looking around at the same time is nigh impossible, as you're constantly struggling against the camera. It gets worse the closer you move around walls, inside tight corridors, or close to ledges, as the camera likes to suddenly flip or spin around, resulting in you running into said wall – or off a cliff. The game was obviously designed to be played with a controller, where this ""camera helper"" might have been a good idea, but when you're used to playing with keyboard/mouse, it becomes unbearable.

												This is the best Tomb Raider game I have ever played. So far, the game was long enough to enjoy, much longer than Legend, that is for sure. There are a few minor bugs if you decide to backtrack, but other than that, this game is a 10/10...except the replay of cutscenes, that was not implemented due to real-time rendering, which was understandable, but wish we could rewatch the cutscenes again.

												If they wanted to give the Tomb Raider series a very forgettable ending, they did it quite well. Everything about this game looks rushed, from the unresponsive and buggy controls to the story, which makes no sense and leaves you with an awful anti-climax. All the content that used to be a constant feature in the series is also gone: Croft Mansion? Nope. Boss battles? Nope. Unlockable costumes? Nope, nope. All that remains is a pretty average platformer that ends in a handful of hours (took 14 hrs to me to find all the - useless - treasures, but just because I died plenty of times due to the bad controls) and has zero replayability or extras. At this point I can see why they decided to reboot the series and focus on a new retelling of Lara's origins.I suggest to play this only if you are curious to see how they closed the trilogy started with Legend, but if you just want to play a nice Tomb Raider game with HD graphics stick to Anniversary. That game was a gem and its quality is incomparable with this half-baked thing.			",302,91,1,26,12,1,25

												Do you like tons of unnecessary deaths caused by incredibly unresponsive controls and environments that look exactly like ledges you can climb on?  Well go no further, you've found your game.  Terrible ""combat"" system, uninteresting characters, short gameplay length, forgetful scenes, and puzzles so easy my 11 month old daughter pointed out the solutions.  The story was pretty interesting, some of the locations were neat...  All in all if done correctly could make a pretty interesting movie, especially if the actress playing Lara wore the lingirie as the character.  There are much better TR games, but this one being free at the time led for a fairly interesting waste of a few hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The control is horrible and sometimes the camera angle is just horrible too with a lot of glitch. The puzzles and fights are too easy, and most of the fights are so unnecessary. There are no boss fights, only cutscenes. BUT! It is a Tomb Raider, Lara is sexy as usual, the scenes are beautiful and you get the usual atmosphere with really nice music. I recommend it to every Tomb Raider fan, but if you don't like frustrating games then skip it.			",138,21,4,14,8,1,19

												Tomb Raider Underworld could turn out as one of the best TR games but sadly it doesnt :/The levels are really well designed the story is awesome as it follows Legend and anniversary story line and ends it. but why am i saying it is not a good game compared to others?All boss fights are cutscenes you do not need to put %1 effort for killing any of those bosses in fact this game doesn't have any bosses while it could have atleast 10, Amanda + Natla + Huge squid + Lara Clone + The tough marine guy at first level and so on all of these could be a nice boss fight at the end of each level but sadly you just have to walk to them and a cutscene appears and you just sit back and watch the fight then it is over without %1 effort.There are some good things about this game like the targeting system with dual weapons that you can shoot two targets at the same time, Lara has some new moves and climbing methods and she can even do some karate moves, there are many enemies in each level which stops the game from being boring like Anniversary, the other good thing is the ending is some like legend where you take Thor's Hammer ( Arthur's sword in legend) and it exactly acts like the sword in legend. You can change your gear any time at the current level (i personally do not like this sort of games).I really dunno if i should recommend this game or not, for one time try it worths it and it feels like a good story if you have the background from Legend and Anniversary but between these 3 games this is my reconnmendation: 1st Legend 2nd Underworld and 3rd Anniversary in fact i do not recommend anniversary at all because it is just way too boring and dull. in fact if they had combined anniversary and underworld together they could make the best tomb raider which was continueing Legend story and ending it.%50 recommending it and %50 not recommending it is a bit hard to decide about this game for me			",182,13,5,3,7,3,23

												just finished it, after 12 hour with a little goofing arround on the motorbike and several death (caused by me, human error and some little bugs).i like it, the start is a bit boring, but the varying level design keept me going.the sounds and the music are nice, the riddles sometimes very tricky and time consuming-you get what you pay for, a real tomb raider game.the story is okay for this genre, the graphics sweet for a 2008 production.the animations are mostly realistic, exept when you die, then  lara becomes a bouncy ball.negative is that the steam in game overlay doesnt work for any reason, so you wont be able to take any screenshots, nor can you use the steam friends application. all together its still worth your money.

This game is much longer and somewhat harder. However, the difficult is still not what it should be. Though, I do feel none Tomb Raider fans would be pleased with the level of difficulty.

												After playing the 2 prequels to this game I was expecting something very big for the end of the rebooted trilogy.The first game, TR Legend, was a masterpiece. I have not played the older versions and this was the first TR I played and was truly amazed how good and unique it was for such an old game.The second, TR Anniversary, was even better in every way! The managed to up themeselve on every aspect.But this game is such a disappointement I had to delete it and search for the story only to watch, because I was not able to fix any of the issues I had with it.Not only does it not feel like a Tomb Raider it doesnt look like it either. And gameplay?Camera angles/stuttering gave me a headache. Controls are not responsive. I had 3 unexplained crashes. I have to run the game on lowest settings to minimize problems.My specs are:- AMD FX8350- Radeon HD7950 3GB-16GB ramWell I've never made a video before, but after what I experience I had to.

												My sense of disappointment with the anti-climactic ending to this day remains.   What if the zombie at the end raally was Lara's mother?  Couldn't she at least have tried to talk to her.   'Hey mom you fell into that blue goop and became undead but at least you're alive!  Even if there are weird bits stuck on your face and stuff we can afford plastic surgery!'.   MAybe all she wanted was a hug?  Is helheim cold this time of year? Gee.  What I mean to say is that The Original Tomb Raider didn't really take the supernatural.. too far to the realm of absurdity.     The new tombraiders generally do.  Which is disappointing. because generally the graphics are really fantastic and the gameplay often quite engaging.  Suppose it's ok if you're up for a  dose of zany wierdness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What? you start a game whit all gun's available? how? it seems really funny that you can start a game whit all weapons and when you want to see how much bullets you have you have to check it in your invertory what is kind of stupid. third thing is walking and camera.. they are just too daamn horrible they dont want to be in right place anytime.. jumping needs to be 100% perfect or lara will jump somewhere else mostly dropping and dieing lulz lolz but that goes good after 30min of playing. fourth is enemy's. at ship part the enemy's was stupid as ever can be.. they can't shoot and they can't see. So be far take m4 and just spam and tadaaa. story line has been really awful.. lara just surrender after few guys pointing a gun at her.. why? she can kill a hole army whit all thouse gun's what she have. the reason why I gave 1,6 is because of the game character I love the A$$ and boobs what she has lol. after 1hour and 30minutes thouse were only in my mind because the game went really shiat. and these character have really really big eye's. it looks funny :P but my point is that now its awful buggy and laggy but I'm going to finish this even whit the bugs ! and don't buy this game I dont recommend on PC			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a bad game, but they keep trying to add new stuff that doesn't work. After finishing TR : Legend ( a somewhat smooth but short experience ) I wanted to give this one another try. Could never finish it because most of the time I end up ragequiting, and here is why :- the controls sucks sometimes and Lara dies- the balancing mechanics on wooden beams sucks and Lara dies- the wall multi-jump mechanics doesn't work and you have to start over, or Lara dies- the headshot system sucks and is completely useless- you have to fight the camera constantly, and Lara dies- Ai is mindless or berserk- the save system sucksIn fact this game could have been called Tomb Raider : Lara dies a lot. I died more time in the 2 first levels than in the entire Legend game, only due to bad controls, camera, or design. Maybe it's a good thing that they rebooted the series with the 2013 TR, because the next ""normal"" TR game would have been a real mess full of useless gameplay mechanics just for the sake of adding something new, even if it doesn't work.At least Lara looks good, when she doesn't die. Only play it if you can overcome the bad gamedesign.			",283,30,14,47,16,3,17

												In my opinion this game feels as if the developers were under pressure to release the game, resulting in a game that feel very unfinished. The controls are messy, lara is often all over the place or she doesnt go where you'd want here to go, some controls like the ""throw"" action arent even listed in the keybindings, resulting in utter frustration when you have to solve the cube puzzle with pressure plates right before the relic room, I had to look it up on the internet, and quickly discovered that the thow button was on the Capslock key by default, and could not be changed, who even puts controles on the capslock key right?? The camera is often all over the place aswell, and then you havent got me started on the AI yet. This is by far one of the dumbest AI's I've ever encountered in a game. I'm not even joking when I say that the AI from the enemies in Tomb Raider 1 is far better than the AI from Underworld. One of the best examples of this is when you are on the enemy ship, the guards often face their backs to you, dont see you or stand there twitching stupidly when they get shoot.			",97,6,3,2,3,0,0

There is an area where your post to use the cubs to weigh down the pressure plate. But the cubs randomly fly off the screen anytime you pick them up and set them down. i have ran this game on Windows 7 and Windows 8, and it seems to be the same issue. There is a major PC bug.

												Highly do not recommend. Game play is horrible. Puzzles are the normal for Tomb Raider-but cannot be completed due to bad game play. I am stuck placing blocks to hold down weights on fllor, every time I place a weight, it flies away from where I put it. It literally flies off the ground, across the room, and settles where-ever it wants. Throwing the blocks is no help either. It is almost like there is a force feild around the weights on the floor that prevent placing the weights on it to help open the doors to continue the story.Climbing and jumping from/to objects is not good either- the camera likes to shift mid/pre jump and for some reason you follow the path of the camera. I have literally jumped in a circle as the camera angle shifts. I thought maybe my computer is the issue, so I tried it on my laptop- same issues.  ",15,0,0,14,1,0,0

												To be honest, the game disappointed me.For a product present on the market for so long, and one which is supposedly on its last patch, TR:U is uncomfortably buggy: stuck points, position estimation errors, weird physics at times, control problems and annoying camera behavior - you name it, it's there. You wouldn't believe how many deaths I experienced just because the camera refused to cooperate or Lara did not grab a 100% sure ledge for some reason. I don't understand how did they manage to screw it up when they had the near perfection of TR: Anniversary as a template.Another thing is the plot. I know this is not the most imortant aspect of an adventure game, but holy smoke is the story in Underworld uninspiring. I especially love it how Lara is emotionally disconnected from her long-time co-workers and supposedly friends. An outstanding display of long-lasting bonds, built upon trust, hardships, ups and downs and life-threatening situations endured together throughout the years of working together... Not really.Last but not least, what's the point of the artifacts and relics in this game? When the former is completely useless and you basically trip over one or another every other step, the latter offers you only the ""advantage"" of expanding your health bar - not that this boost will ever make a difference in combat and sure as hell won't save you when falling off a ledge. Also, you cannot even view the collected stuff in your manor. One of the amazing feats of the previous games was that you could always come back to the manor and look at the unique tokens brought back from your adventures - it was like an internal achievement system and really satisfying. And here you are to enjoy collecting generic cubes and orbs. Fun.The game is visually beautiful and most of the locations are quite interesting - I'll give the game that. However, the fact that the gameplay tends to be quite uncooperative because of the reasons listed above, I couldn't really enjoy it that much. More frustration than fun, really.To sum up, the game seems very rushed to me and sadly is a wasted potential. They wanted to close the story weaved through Legend and Anniversary and did so but without the effort they should have put in the title. This is one game I will definitely not come back to.If you're thinking of going for this game, do yourself a favour and (re-)play Tomb Raider Anniversary instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: February 19, 2015
												I picked up Tomb Raider Underworld when it was on sale, wanting to finally get around to seeing the conclusion of the story Tomb Raider Legend started. The subtitle is extremely relevant, as we see Lara exploring the reality behind various cultures' interpretation of hell and the afterlife in a quest to discover the fate of her mother, once and for all.However, by the end of the game, the subtitle gained a second meaning to me as its where I wanted the game to go once I had finished it.Platforming's always been a big thing in Tomb Raider, and in this game Crystal Dynamics clearly wanted to ramp things up a notch. For instance, Lara can chimney jump, balance on poles; abseil using her grappling hook or using it to run along walls - all this in addition to the usual jumping, climbing and shimmying along ledges. On paper, Lara is alot more versatile than any of her previous incarnations, but in the actual game all these moves are plagued by abysmal controls. Quite often Lara will often ignore your commands outright, or do the exact opposite.I recall one instance where I was running back and forth along a wall (via the grapple) and at the very end of the run, jump back off the wall to land on a bridge. I spent 15 minutes on this alone just because of how disobedient the controls were.Combine this with the fact Crystal Dynamics tried to make their levels more open ended. I think they succeeded all too well. There are times where you will feel completely clueless as to what you're supposed to do (hence the inclusion of a (scarcely helpful) 'Field Assistance' feature)) and sometimes you will be scaling up a wall only to find it goes to absolutely nowhere; a habit that becomes prevelant in the later stages of the game. I hope you're ready to reload alot.And speaking of, the save system is pretty stupid in this game aswell. You have about 20 slots, which seems like plenty until you realise autosaves take up their own individual slots and cannot be overwritten. Graphically the game is showing its age a bit, but its decent enough. Just pray that if you do end up playing this you don't encounter a glitch that caused my game to freeze for a split second and occured every 2 to 3 seconds. I miraculously managed to fix it but I've trawled through a few forums to see plenty of other people having similar problems on rigs that far outclass this game in terms of specs.There are good points to this game, mind. Most of the levels are fantastic in terms of their design and scale. You'll go through ruins of various cultures and they all feel distinct from one another. The story itself is good too (better if you're coming here from Legend) and features some decent twists and recurring characters. There's even two pieces of DLC to tie up a few loose ends... if you're playing the Xbox 360 version, that is. As if there needed to be any more evidence that this is a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥PC port.In brief, I came here purely for a nice conclusion to Legend's story and I got it. Its just buried under a mountain of niggling problems that make it feel not worth the effort.			",237,30,7,23,10,2,35

												Worst Tomb Raider title I've ever played amongst the Legend and the Anniversary.Pros:  + It makes other horrible games look adorable.Cons:  -Controls and cameras.-Puzzles. (They are not even puzzles)-Silly enemies and animals. (They all act like stupid robots)-Total waste of money. My gameplay time extends 13 hours. I might say the definite 4 hours of it is to control Lara. Thumbs down for gameplay mechanics.Conclusion: Does not worth the money.			",254,25,4,13,8,0,10

Funny fact, as an archeologist and adventurer, this version of Lara seem to have no respect for old relicsm she's usually kicking the urns like it's a rugby ball.While i've enjoyed TR I, II, III, Anniversary and TR 2013, underworld made me delete the game after 48 minutes of gameplay due bugs.

												Are you ready to be frustrated and aggravated? Are you ready to repeat the same moves over and over? If not, skip this one over.The camera is ridiculous and sometimes Lara goes in the complete opposite direction of where you direct her to go. Other times you will be jumping blindly forward or backward hoping that it's the correct direction because you can't spin the camera around. Oh! And prepare to have Lara spaz out and get stuck in numerous areas while you flail about on the controller trying to get her unstuck. The game itself is beautiful and the story is nice, but the camera/controls make it almost unplayable.			",35,14,0,12,12,0,1

												Simple puzzles, average platforming, and pathetically easy combat hold back what could have been a great Tomb Raider game. Everything felt rushed, from the lack of boss fights to the short levels. There are good ideas buried in this unfinished mess, but nothing in this game is rewarding. It feels like it really wants to reward you for your time, but it doesn't know how to, apart from showing you Lara's♥♥♥♥♥throughout the entire game.So, with a very weak ending to an already weak game (albeit with lots of potential), I cannot see me recommending this game. If this is really all they could do with the formula after all these years, then maybe it was best to reboot the Tomb Raider series after all.			",226,25,1,22,11,2,12

												Terrible camera ruins otherwise okay game.It autocenters when it shouldn't.It doesn't autocenter when it should.Sometimes it's completely blocked by terrain.The only way to swim without drifting up is to constantly reposition your view down.Most of the time the player model takes up 80+% of the screen, which makes any sort of combat a complete mess.There are tons of climbing spots that completely lock the camera to a single field of view.And to top it off, movement controls are relative to the camera's position. One moment, left could be left, then the camera randomly shifts and makes left right.The camera is so bad that you'll eventually find a few spots in the game where you can press forward and get stuck in a movement loop.

												Linear gameplay, bad looking combat, and tedious puzzles make this game boring above all else.Y'know when you go to the doctor's office, and it takes hours for you to get to the actual appointment? And after a while you just want the end of the wait to be over so you can see the doctor, and say you got your appointment?That's what Tomb Raider: Underworld is like.I recommend Tomb Raider: Anniversary instead (if you haven't already bought it.)

												It IS possible to like this game, or more than like it, but I just cannot. If you like FPS games where that character you play jumps, stops, shoots, ducks, etc. when you want them to..............well, this game doesn't do that, nor do any of the past few tomb raiders for that matter. If you just like the ""feel"" of it and the environment, and are not dismayed by the mindless endless repeating of things because your quirky control of Lara committed suicide by walking off a high area, then maybe there's hope for you. For me, that's not my definition of fun nor entertainment, I can tell when I start wanting to cause physical harm to my monitor due to sheer frustration. In other words, things do not happen as fluidly as they should. Right now I'm looking at it and the price is $2.24, I got it part of some other package. If it were free I still wouldn't like it, but that's me. Although this game being a platformer may be debateable, what is required to progress in it is not. You have to jump at an exact moment, at an exact time, heading an exact way, at an exact height....yeah, no thanks. Al that does is guarantee multiple repetition of the same sequense. In my book that equals boring.			",93,29,0,13,3,0,31

												I bought this one because I like Tomb raider 2013 version and wanna try the previous generation but this game made me headache everytime i played and have to stop playingI guess this kind of camera view is not good with me.I used to play new one already so this one has less option, weapons and action to do compare to 2013 versionIf you don't have motion sickness like me and want to try other version of tomb raider maybe its ok to buyFor me, i'm quite regret cause i cant enjoy the game much when I have to play game and get headacheso i just try to finish the story without finding the collections then bye bye this game ",7,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Glitches and bad controls make it extremely unpleasant to play.The jumps are too short, they feel weird and artifically shortened. By comparison jumping off a ledge you can jump much farther than with a running jump. What?The dodge mechanic is unweildy and hard to manage. The last thing I want to be doing when trying to dodge something is finicking around with having to press 3 buttons at once to make it happen.I gave up when in one of the early puzzles you had to weight down some switches with boxes (I assume, I didn't complete it) and my boxes both went flying off into space as soon as I put them down. Not just a freak glitch, it happened every time until I realized you have to wait for the (fully pressed down) switch to stop making noise before you could set them down or they would rocket off like they had a mission for the moon. I was unable to find one of them again I assume it landed in the water behind me and there was no way to get it back, at which point I quit the game.			",132,29,0,35,22,0,34

												Tried to play this for nostalgia.. But ♥♥♥♥ no.Game grinds to a halt all of a sudden. Controls are clunky as ♥♥♥♥. All of a sudden you drop something and it warp speeds to the opposite side of the map. This is definitely one of those games that gets worse with age.

												Наверно, единственная игра из серии, которую я купила сразу после выхода (2008 год). Тогда мне нравилось все.Разнообразные локации и скандинавская мифология.Графика.Взрослые реальные (приближенные к живым людям) персонажи, хотя и не все: Натла и Блондинка (забыла как зовут х)) все таки не очень хорошо проработаны.Анимация, боевые движения (тогда вроде захват движения был использован первый раз?)В общем, было видно, что постарались )Но все равно оставался, какой-то неприятный осадок.И только сейчас я понимаю почему: игра слишком перенасыщена всем этим, что я перечислила выше 😂 Ну, правда, авторы хотели всем угодить, а в итоге перестарались. В частности смущает несуразная история. PS Я сегодня слишком жестокая.			",34,42,2,1,0,0,3

At some places you just can't get the right move to get to another point. The result is you have to go up the same long way again and again until you figured out how to do the jump.

												The first Tomb Raider game for seventh generation consoles, artists finally had enough processing power to push the limits of computer graphics and render pants on Lara Croft.Inferior to Tomb Raider Anniversary in almost every way. Motion capture was used for Lara's animations, so there's no smooth tweening between actions; it feels really stiff. The art style skewed realistic at the expense of gameplay. There are lots of ridges visible all over objects, but only some of them are grabbable. Level design has gone downhill; things are poorly signposted, and I spent a lot of time in certain places wandering around trying to find the next area.Then there are the glitches. Lara won't consistently grab irregular ledges for some reason. The final level has lots of moving platforms that Lara ""homes in on"" when you jump towards them, except when she doesn't. There's a Sands of Time type mechanic when fighting undead where you have to deal the final blow after they've fallen, but half the time Lara just does a spin kick instead.The graphics are a lot prettier than previous games, and there are no boss fights. Other than that? Just go play Anniversary.			",332,76,12,63,22,5,68

												It is a hard decision to recommend this game or not.  THE GAME ITSELF IS FINE.  I have played this game before and love it.  I recently bought it on Steam for my new laptop (which, apparently has no CD/DVD Drive.  Must be a new feature of laptops.  Ironic(?) because it is a GAMING laptop.).  At any rate, My laptop is great.NVDIA GEFORCE GTX 970m, i7 core, 12GB ram, etc.This game runs the new Tomb Raiders just fine all maxed out.  It runs older games (Metro, Anniversary, etc) maxed out, no problem.  Hell, it even runs Call of Cthulhu Dark Corners (With a bit of fidgeting because it's Win10) just fine.  But this game gets choppy in places, glitches out when I pick up objects (I spent 30min trying to place the two stupid small boxes on the pressure pad but the game would set them down and then throw them off.)  I have NEVER had this many issues with this game before.  I had the DVD version which ran smoothly on an older computer.  So I assume that it has something to do with the STEAM version.  I've read other players having the same issues with the steam version too, so I assume it isn't just me.  Overall, if you want to play this, find it on another download client or buy the disc.  This version seems to be really bugged.			",46,4,0,7,0,0,3

												I have to say that I don't recommend this game. The mechanics need more polish. One example is one jump might appear close enough, but since you're not supposed to go there, you'll fall and die. You will successfully leap across a larger gap if you are meant to go that route. This kind of trial an error sucks. There is a major physics glitch that nearly prevents you from completing the game. (Vsync helps.) You will be manually adjusting the camera almost constantly to undo the angles it automatically chooses. Combat is really an annoying part of the game.What was good? The puzzles and climbing parts were fun. Unfortunately, everything else that surrounds the core gameplay to make it a more fleshed out game ends up detracting from the enjoyment of the game. That, coupled with the poor mechanics and glitches, ruins the game overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know what I think about this game. It feels like a mix of Anniversary and Legend. It brings back a lot of things that the old Tomb Raiders featured. You have vehicles, massive tombs, and a lots of animals to shoot. I think the problem with this game was that they brought back that action movie feel with the music and the fighting. It starts off great, but then it sort of drifts off into massive combat later in the game. Still, a good game overall, I'd say almost as good as Tomb Raider 3.			",213,12,5,6,9,1,2

TL;DR SUMMARY: Extremely mixed feelings, but overall, definitely a disappointment after the excellent Legend and Anniversary. Some interesting locations and clever puzzles are brought down by the extremely frustrating trio of ""you can't climb here because ♥♥♥♥ you"" design + unbelievably annoying and almost unpredictable controls + occasional bugs and weird, derpy movement, as well as a few other questionable changes. It's also almost as short as Legend, while being much less diverse and dynamic. Try only if you've already played Legend and Anniversary, but unfortunately, you have to expect less.FULL REVIEW: It felt to me that after the fast-paced, dynamic Legend and the more oldschool Anniversary with its brilliant, complicated puzzles, plus the excellent storyline that pretty much breathed new life into Tomb Raider, all that has to be done in Underworld is take the best of both, come up with a convincing finish to the story, and it just can't go wrong.But somehow, it did. I really, really tried to like this game and I even briefly succeeded in the second half, but it's done its absolute best to make me dislike it, with success.The biggest problem with Underworld is that it fails where no other Tomb Raider (except maybe Angel of Darkness, which I admittedly never got to play much) did, which is easy movement and exploration. I'll start with the worst, which is the ""trio"" I mentioned above...First of all, this is the first Tomb Raider EVER where the rule of ""if it looks like a ledge and it's within reach, you can grab/climb it"" doesn't work. As I said above, Underworld's entire design can be summed up with ""that ledge over there looks just like the one you just climbed, but you can't climb that other one because ♥♥♥♥ you"". You'll fall to your death countless times trying to grab ledges which look just like those you climbed before, and after finishing the whole game I still haven't found any pattern to determine where you can climb, and where you'll just bounce off the wall and fall down. The entire game is guesswork and trial and error - in every previous Tomb Raider if something wasn't accessible, it was simply out of reach, here you sometimes can't even save 5 seconds of time by climbing a barrier instead of walking around it if the designers didn't intend that.Second is the worst, most dangerous enemy in this game. It's not any kind of final boss (because there isn't any, more on that later), it's the controls. The problem is that Underworld brings some actually pretty cool new acrobatic elements to the table (e.g. you can now walk along narrow ledges or climb onto horizontal poles), but everything is managed with just the Use and Jump buttons (+ Crouch to drop down) and movement keys. This may sound easy to learn and intuitive, but in practice, you'll die countless times by accidentally pressing a movement key when you shouldn't (because there's 5 different things you can do with 2 keys), or simply following habits from every previous Tomb Raider. Not to mention the camera isn't brilliant either, and sometimes jumping off a ledge or pole to the sides is pure lottery and you never really know if you'll land where you intended.Third is that movement itself behaves really weird at times, and is sometimes straight up bugged - I remember at least two areas where I died several times because Lara actually started slipping off a flat surface. Combining all these three together, it feels like the entire game is trying to kill you. Not with deadly traps or enemies, but simply because every time you try to climb or jump somewhere, you can never really be sure what will happen.Now, the main reason why I was so curious about Underworld is the story - I definitely have to give praise for all the mythological references, which are interesting and quite logically tied together. The title of the game is not without reason, as it deals with all sorts of mythical ""kingdoms of the dead"", with the Norse mythology being a kind of central point here. Things are worse, however, with Lara's personal story - Underworld starts very intriguing, with a large explosion in Croft Manor and Lara's assistant, Zip, appearing to shoot her. The whole thing is much darker than the previous two games, but while there are a few interesting plot twists, the story in the end is quite bare-bones compared to Legend and Anniversary, and feels rather like an expansion to Legend than a proper third part of the ""trilogy"" - it feels like it's all over before the story really has a chance to grow, and the side characters are given almost no space at all. The ending is quite powerful, but it also feels underdeveloped, especially compared to how complex and clever the backstory in Legend was.Also... Underworld doesn't have a single boss fight. Lara has essentially three main adversaries here (each one a familiar face, in one way or another), but all combat with them happens only in cutscenes - which is seriously disappointing.Speaking of combat, it's a bit better than in Anniversary, but nowhere near as fun and dynamic as it was in Legend, and the enemies are not very diverse. There are some animals as usual, human enemies appear only three times, and in the second half of the game, 90% of enemies are ""thralls"", who are essentially zombies. They are an interesting change at first, but they eventually start pouring out in dozens, and they're not exactly the most fascinating opponents to fight, as they simply charge at you, and there's only two types of them. After killing 50 or so, I hoped there would be something else again... but there isn't, they're all you'll fight until the end of the game. This also leads us to a change I seriously dislike - weapons aren't found or unlocked anywhere in Underworld, you just get all five (+ grenades) from the beginning and can switch between them at any time, with enough ammo to make pistols mostly unnecessary for anything besides killing bats and small spiders.The last thing I have to mention, this time mostly positive, is level design - an interesting thing is that now usually each level is a fairly large area, divided into several chapters, and in the end you usually need to actually find the exit and return to where you began. There's some pretty clever puzzles, and a very cool new addition are missions where you can use a motorcycle - while that in itself is nothing new, in Underworld it's much more extensive as you spend a large part of the level using it, even inside the temples, and it's the only time the controls are actually intuitive and enjoyable. And speaking of locations, I should also mention the graphics - I'm writing this in 2016, so the game is 8 years old (which makes me feel ancient) and it still looks very nice. Both the character models and the environment are quite detailed, many effects are also quite spectacular (especially a certain glowing liquid which you'll see a lot later on). And the one thing that's on par with Legend and Anniversary is voice acting, which is excellent and very convincing, especially Lara's voice.So, that's it. I'm generally quite forgiving, especially to series I'm a fan of, but Underworld is unbelievably frustrating to play at times and makes it almost impossible to just fully get into the game and enjoy it. I'm seriously puzzled by all the praise I read about it, especially claims that it's ""less linear"" and ""enjoyable to explore"" (WAT) - a combination of really dumb and lazy decisions made by designers, as well as clearly not enough testing make it a disappointment, especially that it's the ending of the excellent story started by Legend and Anniversary. It's not a bad game... but it should have been much, much better. The ending of this ""trilogy"" deserved more.			",23,1,0,0,1,0,4

												This is a game i would have a hard time recommending to anyone really. For a modern game, it has some very difficult puzzles at times, which is one of the only good things about the game. The other thing being Lara looking more gorgious then ever! The puzzles are never straight forward, and can often be a real brainwrapper to complete. This is really nice, for an age where you are expected to progress by the push of a button.Sadly, the game has not much else to offer.  The controlls are unusual, especially during ""jumping-puzzles"" where they shuffle around, literally. Changing the camera angle will change which way the controlls will have you go. This can get so confusing, and it's hard to get used to. It isn't helping much either, that the camera constantly works against you. Sometimes it is also hard to tell if you can grab a ledge or not, this has had me stuck in a few areas for unpleasently long time.The combat system is probably one of the most boring features of the game, for me it felt incredibely dull, fighting human AI is the worst, as holding down the trigger is all you need to do to achieve victory, as every shot they take freezes them for a frame or two, allowing you to kill them before they can retaliate. Fighting wild life is a whole other game, and is almost too difficult. The camera will always do it's best to get your view as far off the attackers as possible. And it is often hard to avoid enemy strikes. There is alot of very complicated 'special move' controlls, that i never got to use as the combo was impossible to remember. It is also littered with bugs and glitches as you'd come to expect. The worst of these, being that the ingame physics are highly(EXTREMELY) affected when Vsync is off. Carriable items will fling Lara around, fly away when put down, or clip you through the level. Often grapplehook objects can't be affected either. Why this was never caught in testing is beyond me, As it renders 90% of the physic based puzzles unsolveable. The game also lacks a Steam community GUI, it does however make up for this with flawless alt-tabing. (Have had no crashes with this yet)In the end, the game fails to mix much of interest inbetween the endless waves of puzzles, boring fights, and difficult jumping session. Not to mention the very repeative enviroments, and areas. Most of the ruins are very alike, altho this is intentional. The game's main focus seems to be on what it does best, puzzles! But for me, doing nothing else then completing puzzles can get boring very quick, and i oftenly took serval days of break from playing, due to getting bored. Before finally giving up, as i got stuck towards the end of the game. Yet another game i will never complete.In conclusion, this seems like a decent console port, sadly the PC features feel untested, the shuffling controlls, annoying camera, boring combat system, repeative enviroments and too many puzzles, are not helping it at all. I feel the only two good things in the game is the most gorgious looking Lara to date, and the puzzles. which there are too many ofBeyond that, as i already said, i think it's hard to recommend. But, for 9€ you should get your moneys worth, if you enjoy puzzles.			",122,7,1,3,5,0,12

												Game looks beautiful. That's the only positive thing I can say.The controls are horrible, Laura dies to a fall of 2 meters and it's buggy as hell. I'm stuck on the Kraken because Laura refuses to pull the gearwheel. She just shakes her head and I can't continiue the game. I have tried loading a previous save and restarting the game.

												(I played this game on xbox)I'm not saying this is a bad game, I just think it's not as good as the others. The game looks stunning, the levels are absolutely mesmerising and the animations look great. The story is also good, but the levels were so long and frustrating sometimes, it felt like a chore. It's a bit difficult and the camera angles don't really make it better. I would still play this game, but make sure you have a lot of patience.			",39,7,0,11,2,0,0

												The bugs on the engine are awful! Sometimes you need to put a stone somewhere and the stone just have his own life and go whatever they want. Also, slowdowns! No one cares what videocard you have (i have a Ivy i5, 8Gb ram and gtx650), you can put all the graphics to low, sometimes you'll have a huge slowdown, no matter what you do. Seriously, some things in games must be fixed, and it seems this game wasn't being fixed since 2008. FFS.			",172,40,4,25,9,1,11

												Someone at Crystal Dynamics or whoever created this game probably thought ""Y'know what a player wants to do after they jump their bike into a spike pit? They want to respawn off the bike. Also when they're trying to climb out of water, they certainly don't want to grab the ledge and get up first try, they want the character to automatically grab the corner so they can pull themselves up and fall back into the water again. Good plan, great plan!""The graphics are ok, and the story is somewhat interesting from what I've played, but it's certainly a struggle to continue on with such awkward controls. It's 5 years old now, so I'll cut it a bit of slack, but not much. >:|			",314,74,13,28,21,6,17

												Tomb Raider:Underworld is what is what is expected from the series another mediocre experience. With Underworld's crappy camera making some parts of the game way more difficult than they should be. The camera isn't the only thing that takes away from the experience the weird glitches i've encountered ruin the game even more. Do not buy Tomb Raider:Underworld unless you are a fan of the series or just love mediocre games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm secretly enjoying this game, don't want my fanboys to know.Normally I don't like to play games like these that have so much puzzles in them.I have better things to do, but I am enjoying Lara Croft and her aimbot.And yet again their's a save bug, when you save and die orso it will load a checkpoint and not your save and you then lose your save as it will then only load that checkpoint.Due to the ammount of puzzles I feel the storyline is slacking a bit.But it's worth buying this game, i'd say onsale since it's old.- The Saving Bug and Crashing is why I had t downvote it, fed up with it.

												I have never played any Tomb Raider game before this one.  I was not sure what to expect.What I found was a game full of jumping puzzels.  There is some combat (very poorly done) thrown in and there is a little exploration as well (which I do like).  However it seem most of the game (in what little I played) invloved climbing and jumping from point to point.  If you mess up, you generally have to start the puzzle all over again.Needless to say, I didn't care for this game and do not reccomend it.If you do buy it and experience some wonkyness in the physics, turn on VSync and that will correct your physics problems.

												Underworld isn't a bad game, but it's a step back from Legend, which is IMO unexcusable. My guess is some talent (developers) left the team between games or something. The step up in graphics is kinda nice though? Still no Steam Overlay, even though Anniversary had it. For goodness sake, even Sega's Dreamcast ports have steam overlay. Animations feel awkward, gameplay is a bit sluggish compared to Legend and Anniversary. Her 2 funny best buds aren't quipping in her ear non-stop. Despite being a step forward in fidelity, things are more grey and mono-tone / mono-color, and her outfits are maybe a step back. Story presentation isn't very gripping. Forwards can be hard to find. Get Legend first (consider playing with next gen content off), and get Underworld later if you finish Legend and want more. Or compare with Batman Arkham Series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FINISHED GAME ON XBOX 360.This game has some nice visuals at times and some grand levels without any loading times during gameplay or graphical glitches. The achievements are very solid too. However, that's about the only praise that can be given to this game. Story is naff, combat is practically pointless and non-existent throughout most of the game and the focus is entirely on navigating the levels' puzzles and platforms. This wouldn't be too bad if the mechanics, camera and level design were robust. Unfortunately, they are the game's biggest problem. Most of the time when you get stuck, it's not because you couldn't work out where you're meant to go, but the game's physics and camera angle being so obscure that the ledge or platform is glitch to try and get to. Some places which should clearly be scalable aren't, and those which are where you're meant to go are awkwardly placed and will result in many deaths due to the inconsistent directional input detection relative to the camera position. The left and right sticks are almost completely unrelated. The only reason you know where to go is because the game is very linear; there is only one way to play the level and one particular ledge you have to use every time. There is literally zero scope for creativity or playing it your own way. The levels themselves offer a good variety of environments including snow, jungle, underwater and indeed, a tomb. Overall though, Underworld is a bad game with little to offer, and is quite boring to play as well as being broken.			",90,1,7,1,2,0,6

												Nope. A most definite ""Nope"".I played just 2 or 3 minutes effectively and cannot say anything about in-depth gameplay or story, but one thing already ruined the game no matter how good those may be: The controls.I'm not sure how it acts on controllers, i suspect no better though. You might have had some terrible experiences with the other, newer tomb raider games which all have poor controls, but this is a new dimension of ""f***ed up"". I'm playing video games for fifteen years now, several hours per day, and I've never encountered a game that made me nauseous so far. Until now.The little fact that the camera automatically tries to adapt to your character movement (which is glitchy already) and tries to overwrite your controls leads to an immense clusterf*** of camera movements. I proceeded in the game until you have to pull open the door with the grappling hook before I had to quit and empty my stomach in the bathroom.I'll see if I can find a workaround for this (i.e. blocking this particular behaviour somehow), but since the game does not offer any solution or setting regarding this, it's definitely a reason not to buy the game.

												It's like having Parkinson and trying to thread a needle on a roller coaster. The challenge should be in the environment itself, NOT simply trying to maintain control of the character. The spastic control, glitchy camera movements, makes this game painful to try and play even with a GTX960 4G OC, Controller, and 16GB of ram all running on an SSD it's laggy, jerky, and ultra low frame rates.

												Cons: - combat is sort of boring, lara has aimbot- platforming is glitchy and will be the cause of many of your deaths- some levels feel very untested, there are a ton of glitches (espetially in the motorcycle sections)- loading times were slow, at least for me (quad core 2.5ghz, 7770 HD radeon, 6gb of ram)- entire game got really ""catchy"" at times (good fps but would hang on certain frames for half to a full second)- The supporting charicters are kinda dumb and forgettable, except for the rival girl- the enemy AI gets bugged out somewhat frequentlyPros- YOU GET THOR'S HAMMER AS A WEAPON. 10/10in all seriousness, it was fun, glitches aside. If your a completionist with collectables in the game, it has a nice feature of being able to visit ANY level after you beat the game with all paths unlocked and all enimies dead so you can just explore. The game looks beutiful and the story is interesting. I loved the norse mythology of the crypts that you explore. even with the glitches, the motorcycle sections were pretty fun. I would rank this tomb raider game above tomb raider legends for sure, but tomb raider aniversery and the recent reboot are better than this. I would actually rank it close in quality with the old games (I only played TR 2 and 4).			",436,76,3,36,13,4,40

												I really enjoyed this trilogy from Crystal Dynamics. I don't think Underworld was the strongest of the three though. I ran into more glitchiness, like getting stuck in rocks, that I recall in the other two. I also didn't like the lack of boss fights. The closest was the giant squid, which was more of a puzzle and less of a boss fight. I'm really fired up for the reboot later this year (which hopefully evolves the combat a bit) and still need to finish Guardian of Light.It's worth noting that Underworld is rated ""Excellent"" for 3D Vision and was really awesome. It makes me want a 3DTV for Uncharted 3 even more, as these type of games with the huge set pieces really works well in 3D.			",377,85,7,28,9,4,37

												A nice little game to add to the Tomb Raider Collection. Some puzzles are a little temperamental with object placement, at least for the PC version, but I still love the adventure/puzzle solving that Tomb Raider brings. Underworld offers up some stunning visuals as you pick up where Legend left off and rounds up the story nicely. Worth a play and I'm more than stoked for the new Tomb Raider coming out next year.

												Played the new Tombraider reboot and liked it, so decided to try an older TR game as I've never played a classic Tombraider game to the end. Chose Underworld as it's one of the most recent (from 2008). Although graphics are a bit retro, visually there's some fantastic levels as you gyrate through Norse Niflhiem, Valhalla and Helhiem in an epic quest to find out what happened to mumsy (with some great cut-scenes). I found I had to use the walkthroughs (e.g. www.tombraiderchronicles.com/underworld/walkthrough) as sometimes as it's tricky to spot whats a ledge and whats not (nothing lights up to help). I found I had to use the keyboard for some jump sequences and my Xbox wireless PC controller for others, and it was never obvious which one would suite best. Tricky controls & dodgey camera angles can become infuriating when Lara suddenly chucks herself sideways and plunges to her doom for umpteenth time, so you might well end up throwing the Xbox controller against the wall at some point - particularly if like me you've never owned a games console. Things like working out how to cling to pillars i.e. release left/right after you leap, take a while to sink in, and just a slight missalignment of the camera angle results in disaster.  Plus when Lara croaks you go right back to the beginning of the sequence, even if you saved midway. Some great acrobatic puzzles for Lara though.Still other than the occasional tantrum, I really enjoyed the game and completed it in just over week playing in the evenings at medium difficulty  (STEAM says it took 23 hours, mostly spent looking at Lara's a*s).  Overall I found it frustating fun and worth playing (9/10 as I really liked the storyline as well). Doubt I'll play the game again though, so I'd only suggest buying it if cheap.  Now moving on to Tomb Raider: Anniversary which many say is even better than Underworld.			",189,30,6,11,14,1,23

												I was not a Tomb Raider fan before the entire Crystal Dynamics trilogy (Legend, Anniversary, Underworld), but their take on the franchise contains some ludicrous stories well told and some hair-tearing puzzles cleverly designed. Underworld is the standout. It's the most linear of the bunch (which means both less complexity and less tedium), but at the same time achieves a sense of epic scale not matched by the others. It's the little things Crystal Dynamics does so right - the art design is - as always - stupendous, the sound design some of the best in gaming...it'll take you places other games haven't even bothered to try...and oh, that climax...the final battle is a truly incredible, constantly shifting puzzle/firefight that will always hold a special place in my gamer heart. I highly recommend buying TR: Legend and Underworld in a sale, since the story links so well...as well as Anniversary, if you've got a lot of patience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On my computer the framerates were so fast that I ran into playability issues. I was so stressed out because whenever I would pick up a block and try to set it down it would fly hundreds of feet in random directions. So I was reading some tech support forums and found that some people were saying that if they turned the graphic settings or anti aliasing all the way up, it seemed to help but not cure the issue. This got me thinking. Maybe it has to do with framerate? I usually display my framerate in an OSD with a monitoring app and realized that I was getting hundreds of frames per second even with the graphics and AA settings maxed out. So I started experimenting with VSYNC. This fixed the issue. Turn on VSYNC to solve most playability issues. It has been a fun game, the graphics are great, and Laura is hot as ever.

												Aside from some occasionally wonky controls, this is an excellent Tomb Raider game.  The combat isn't exactly challenging but the platforming and puzzle solving are spot on.  If you plan to run this game on a powerful system, be sure to turn on VSync to avoid some problems with the physics engine that make solving certain puzzles otherwise impossible.

												Like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, TR:U has a plot and characters for you to not care about, giant moving set pieces, inane dialogue, formula action, etc.But it's 97% about jumping/climbing puzzles with some switch flipping and giant wheel turning. You also get to kill bats, spiders, sharks, large cats, about 8 Mexicans, and 3 kinds of skeletons re-animated by blue Viking goo. The killing part is done by holding down both mouse buttons and jumping around like you're having a seizure. Health low? Die, then restart 20 feet away with full health.Actually, is there a Bruckheimer movie where the hero frequently interrupts the best action to work on his taxes? That's TR:U's motorcycle sequences. Before getting up to speed, you'll stop so that Lara can kick the hell out of some more ancient pottery. Repeat.Ultimately, it's all driven by the hope that the next section will feature Lara in less clothing, or that collecting all those secret artifacts will unlock sexy costumes in the 2nd playthrough.

												Story wise this game pretty much wraps up the pre-reboot franchise. It carries on and concludes the story begun in TR Legend and it even goes back all the way to the very first game. There is some interesting level design, the combat obviously stepped up its game, Keeley Hawes once again does a great job bringing Lara to life one last time and the whole game has a dark, ""underworld"" tone to it. Overall a great game. A must play if you are interested how the story concludes prior to the reboot.			",61,10,0,16,1,0,13

												Haven't played a Tomb Raider since Tomb Raider II. This one seemed cool, even if the controls were a bit wonky for a console conversion. However on the first level, the second puzzle, two cubes, two pressure plates, the game has already seemed to have failed me. Due to some physics glitch, any time I set the cube down on the plate, it's slung across the room. Noticed on the boards a few other people having similar issues.

												Story wise this game pretty much wraps up the pre-reboot franchise. It carries on and concludes the story begun in TR Legend and it even goes back all the way to the very first game. There is some interesting level design, the combat obviously stepped up its game, Keeley Hawes once again does a great job bringing Lara to life one last time and the whole game has a dark, ""underworld"" tone to it. Overall a great game. A must play if you are interested how the story concludes prior to the reboot.			",61,10,0,16,1,0,13

												All in all an excellent game. There are afew glictes probibly the biggest was placing the cubes down on the preassure plates in the first level. Don't let that put you off because the game seems to fix itself up alot in the later levels. Good adventure and some challenging but rewarding puzzles throughout. I'm surprised the game req 8 gig givien it's 6 years old, heck TR 2013 req 10 gig yet major differences in graphics at lenght. Still though this game looks amazing, the set pieces are very detailed and that combined with fun puzzles and going gun crazy i give it a 8/10. That's just my personel review.			",53,6,3,3,0,0,1

												I loved the other Tomb Raider episodes. But this game is a nightmare. Graphics and physics are absolutely horrible.Graphics: I played this on the same machine (with Windows 8.1) as the latest available Tomb Raider or Crysis 3. The latter two worked fine with high settings, this one lags and glitches often, even with settings on medium.Physics: Lara sometimes walks in plain air, sometimes gets stuck on plain ground, sometimes falls down a ridiculous short distance she would normally jump down without effort and then drops dead, bouncing like she fell from 100 feet, only because the developers wanted you to take another way.I cannot confirm the problems with the weigh riddle though.  Better spend your money on Legend, Anniversary or the latest Tomb Raider.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I myself - a fan of nordic mythology - found the story around Thor's Hammer really nice though it's not really accurate. The levels were nice though really long and I played on difficulty easy where I was able to beat the game without dying too much ;-) I missed the unlocking of new clothes!! It's a pity that Croft Manor doesn't exist here. I think it has to be part of the TR Games and was really disappointed.

												The best of the modern (post-Chronicles) Tomb Raider games in my opinion, and the only one I would recommend purchasing.  The camera and controls can feel clunky and be frustrating to deal with at times though.  This game feels the most like the classics.  The classics still have a special place in my heart though.  I still get chills playing the Lost Valley of Tomb Raider I.  There is some great atmosphere and a decent amount of exploration to be found with TR:U though, and that is why I would encourage those who like the classic TR games to play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far the best Tomb Raider I've played so far. It has large cinemtic levels with lots of puzzles and climbing sections. There are much less silly fights than in previous games and I loved the pacing. Each environment is unique and goes from Central America, Asia, Snowy mountain and cool underwater sections. It finally has some good physics puzzles as well. I didn't get stuck in this game as I did in the previous ones. I highly recommend it 8/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												Cons: - combat is sort of boring, lara has aimbot- platforming is glitchy and will be the cause of many of your deaths- some levels feel very untested, there are a ton of glitches (espetially in the motorcycle sections)- loading times were slow, at least for me (quad core 2.5ghz, 7770 HD radeon, 6gb of ram)- entire game got really ""catchy"" at times (good fps but would hang on certain frames for half to a full second)- The supporting charicters are kinda dumb and forgettable, except for the rival girl- the enemy AI gets bugged out somewhat frequentlyPros- YOU GET THOR'S HAMMER AS A WEAPON. 10/10in all seriousness, it was fun, glitches aside. If your a completionist with collectables in the game, it has a nice feature of being able to visit ANY level after you beat the game with all paths unlocked and all enimies dead so you can just explore. The game looks beutiful and the story is interesting. I loved the norse mythology of the crypts that you explore. even with the glitches, the motorcycle sections were pretty fun. I would rank this tomb raider game above tomb raider legends for sure, but tomb raider aniversery and the recent reboot are better than this. I would actually rank it close in quality with the old games (I only played TR 2 and 4).			",436,76,3,36,13,4,40

												I've been a Tomb Raider fan since 1998 and have all the games. This one is good, but not a favourite of mine.I must say though, it's pretty glitchy on the PC - or maybe that's just my copy, I don't know - so you'll probably want to keep that in mind. I also really dislike the movement animations, they look pretty strange (if I remember correctly, they introduced motion capture for this game, and I don't feel like it turned out all that well). It's not a huge deal, just something that irks me a bit.However, the locations are beautiful, and I love that you can revisit all of the locations you've been to after you've finished the game without having to actually replay the level.Basically, I'd say it's a good game, but not exactly a must-have. It's probably a good idea to try the demo to see if it interests you before deciding, since there are better games in this series that I feel are more worth the money (most of those pretty old, though).

												The best Tomb Raider by far and a great ending to a long running story.  Left open for possible sequels but good to see the main story come to an end.   A must buy for anyone who has followed  the Tomb Raider story from way back as 1996.			",282,114,39,22,26,7,28

												I was not a Tomb Raider fan before the entire Crystal Dynamics trilogy (Legend, Anniversary, Underworld), but their take on the franchise contains some ludicrous stories well told and some hair-tearing puzzles cleverly designed. Underworld is the standout. It's the most linear of the bunch (which means both less complexity and less tedium), but at the same time achieves a sense of epic scale not matched by the others. It's the little things Crystal Dynamics does so right - the art design is - as always - stupendous, the sound design some of the best in gaming...it'll take you places other games haven't even bothered to try...and oh, that climax...the final battle is a truly incredible, constantly shifting puzzle/firefight that will always hold a special place in my gamer heart. I highly recommend buying TR: Legend and Underworld in a sale, since the story links so well...as well as Anniversary, if you've got a lot of patience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start off by saying that this review is not for the game, but rather for the Steam version of the game. I love this game, I've owned it on DVD since it first came out and have played it many times without any issues. I bought it on Steam, because it was on sale and I thought why not have a no disc copy as well.The game Steam installed on my machine is unplayable. I get terrible fps drops every 5 seconds (I have a GTX 670, more than enough to run a game like this) and the controls are impossible. If there's a level where you have to carry a heavy object and place it on a specific surface - you are screwed. Lara keeps either dropping the thing or it just keeps teleporting to a random place on the map, all by itself without you having done anything. Not to mention the camera goes crazy whenever you're climbing a wall or jumping on poles, sometimes resulting in you jumping in the wrong direction and dying.This is not the first time I've seen a Steam version of a game underperform compared to its DVD counterpart. What gives, Valve? And what gives, Crystal Dynamics?UPDATE:Turning vsync on does indeed fix these issues. I think it's an acceptable solution, I don't mind the delay too much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only one of  the Tomb Raider games I was willing to buy, I fiind it quite enjoying. Lara is quite a vivacious character, and it is pleasing to watch her preforming acrobatics with ease. Very good and fun, indeed. Not bad graphics either, for something that came out in 2008.

												Great game, but in order to enjoy it you must be VERY patient about the camera. Probably one of the worse camera implementations ever. The compensation of this is that the game is usally good at placing you at a point where you rarely have to repeat too many steps after an untimely death due to the camera changing intent of a directional button just when you are about to leap. Lara herself is designed well, I only encountered one glitch of her not grabbing onto something and that was mainly the camera's fault.The other BIG issue: Turn V-Sync ON. I had found out that having it off wouldn't allow me to drop items at my feet, but instead have them magically fly across the room. Not good when you are doing a puzzle w/pressure plates.  Once you fix the issue you pretty much forget you ever had it.			",355,116,2,17,12,1,18

												So before all, I will point some things not working in this game.. First being the in-game Steam community. It does not work at all. The gamecan use some optimisations. And that's about it. Aside all of that, this game is a very good game. I recommend you try it (whoever you are). The adventure is epic, and the price is worth it.			",100,17,1,8,6,1,0

												Графика и физика всегда в сериях Tomb Raider хороши, но сюжет какой-то ""неживой"", ничего от части не понятно, что происходит. Ну а так стоит поиграть пару тройку часов. 7 из 10			",122,7,5,6,10,0,4
