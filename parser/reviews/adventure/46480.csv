												This point & click adventure with the mix of Horror & Crime Drama is excellent, Your playing as special agent Victoria Mcpherson who is trying to solve an important murder case that later on involves her grandfather Gustav Mcpherson (The Past) & I'm going to post my thoughts on why I thought it was good.Pros:1. Hard but rewarding puzzles (I sucked at the puzzles)2. Interesting Story3. I liked the mechanic where you use mouse clicks to interact with the dialogue instead of choosing words4. Decent Voice Actors5. Suspenseful Music6. Beautiful Art7. Interesting Set Of NPCs (I hate Browning)8. The game does a good job of acting like a real agent like for example using tools to pick up blood & hair for exampleCons:I don't have any cons to say about this game but if your offended by gore, nudity or women being murdered then this game isn't for you & also don't listen to the metacritic reviews because most of them don't know what a point & click game is. (Ok I have one con, some of the puzzles were ridiculous to do like for example the cooking puzzle which doesn't reward you at all for solving it)			",327,128,2,22,13,3,17

												Still Life9 / 10 (2005)8 / 10 Played in 2015A gruesome Point and Click Adventure. Play as young FBI detective Victoria and investigate serial murders in Chicago. Collect evidence and follow the bread crumbs. The parallel story of the grandfather as a Private PI is brilliant. The puzzles are well thought out and included some real tough ones, do not let this put you off because it is better to use an online guide than to miss out on this story. Some trigger zones are surprinsingly tiny, patience.The Art and 3D spaces are superb and have aged well. The Voice acting is very good and the audioscape was spooky as hell.[Lament] It seems every point and click has it's own ideosynchratic GUI issues, and this one is no different. I got used to it. [/lament]Now I am off to play Still Life 2. Hooray !			",693,342,14,62,81,6,107

Great story, interesting puzzlesHaving liked Syberia (you have to like a game if you've bought multiple copies over the years), when I saw the Still Life trilogy in a bundle (Post Mortem, Still Life, Still Life 2) a few months ago I decided to pick it up.While it's taken me a while to get to this game (not thinking, I played the second in the series first), I'm glad I finally did.Still Life eventually ends up following the lives of two characters, with the real focus on one, Victoria. While at times she seemed like a bit of a teenager (attitude), I actually enjoyed her character pretty dang well. The other character is also interesting, and ... well, spoiler, look forward to playing as him when I get around to Post Mortem.Some of the puzzles are rather challenging, and I'll readily admit that I opted to just look at a guide as time went on; I'm not as smart as I once was, and really I was just digging the story. I have no shame in admitting that.I look forward to playing the rest of the games in this series. Honestly, Still Life gets 5 of 5 stars.			",378,161,11,68,51,1,90

Short version: 77%On the surface, Still Life is just another modern rendition of the Jack the Ripper mythos, told on two timelines. Under it hides one of the most engaging serial murder thrillers ever written for a point ‘n’ click adventure game, completed by a bit cruel, but somewhat realistic puzzles.Long version: I’ll be honest: Still Life is my favourite adventure game. It was developed by Microïds, a French company known for their unique titles, and uses the same gameplay system that was introduced in Benoît Sokal’s Syberia. This system is also its main drawback, since it is designed for very slow play. Everything will seem sluggish, even for this genre: walking speed, dialogues, even the user interface. It’s not as bad as the old FMV adventure games, but it’s up there.On the other hand, all the other areas in game design are almost flawless. The main character, Victoria is a little bit clichéd tough-girl FBI agent stereotype, but she quickly evolves into an interesting character. Throughout the game, she is placed into a lot of neo-gothic scenery that just oozes atmosphere, all to emphasise the urban fantasy theme of the Jack the Ripper style killings she is investigating.The story has another side though: we learn that these killings copy events that already happened in the 1920s in Prague, and Vic’s grandfather (the protagonist of the quasi-prequel, Post Mortem) was involved in them. His segments not only offer insight, but serve as a contrast to Vic’s world with its washed out tone and almost cruel grittiness.The plot may have sort of a fantasy vibe to it, but the gameplay doesn’t. Progressing feels quite natural and realistic, but not without obvious adventure game puzzles like the clock at the morgue or the cookie recipe. Some of them may be a little too cruel, but the reward is always worth it… even if the ending won’t give the satisfaction of closure one may expect– unless they are accustomed to modern French thrillers.

												I'll start off by telling that Still Life is the second game of a trilogy. Post Mortem, introduces one of the protagonists, Gus McPherson but playing the prequel is not mandatory to understand what's going on, although it can help in understanding some of the background story. This game itself ends in a cliffhanger, so playing Still Life 2 is necessary to complete the story. You play as Victoria McPherson who is a young FBI agent in Chicago with a reputation for ignoring procedure. She's investigating a series of brutal murders. When visiting her father during the holidays, she has a peek into her Grandfather Gus's trunk. He was a PI in the 20's and it seems that one of his last cases bears an eerie similarity to the one Victoria is investigating now. The game allows you to use forensic tools such as dusting for fingerprints, using a revealer spray to show cleaned up blood stains, taking photographs and looking for bits of clothing or hair left on the scene but it's used sparingly. Some of the puzzles definitely require the use of a walkthrough and keep in mind that the game switches protagonists on occasion between Victoria and Gus.

Still Life			* 8/10Still life is a very dense and deep detective point & click adventure, to be considered kind of a sequel to post mortem, as in this chapter we play as Victoria McPherson, FBI Agent and Gus McPherson's niece (the main character from post mortem). We start the game straight with a crime scene and you have to do the classic actions: talk, examine and so on. It's interesting the accurate level of interactions, when you need to use forensic tools. Unfortunately the title is old so it isn't updated or anything. Fortunately I didn't have any bad issue with my laptop (which is quite new: i5, nvidia 840m, win 10 64bit) and I've been able to play without any trouble such as crashes or freezes.+++Pros+++ STORY. Victoria McPherson is an FBI Agent working on a serial killer case. Reading her grandfather's diary (Post Mortem's Gus McPherson) she will realize he worked on a case where a serial killer was operating with the same Modus Operandi as her Serial Killer. You will both control Victoria and (through a sort of flashback) her grandfather trying to solve both their cases. A small note: consider this title as a first chapter of a whole story, which is concluded in the second Still Life. I won't say more to prevent spoilers. CHARACTERS. I loved the characters. Each one with his or her own personality, all their dialogues are so credible, and they're well dubbed, I believe. A cast very well built. GRAPHIC. OK, the game is quite old so it's not a matter of resolution or shaders, but of visual aspect. All the scenarios are so beautiful and fascinating, with desaturated color tone that gives them a very dark aspect and creating an excellent atmosphere. RIDDLES. The game presents a nice variety of riddles that involve the classic interaction between items, a more deep and precise interaction between multiple items, scheme puzzles, lockpicking (very tough one, solutions in the web are wrong as well, I had to improvise in the last section), Verbal clues that hide codes and so on. ---Cons--- Dialogues. when you're talking with someone you can choose with left or right mouse click to talk about the case or generic stuff... You don't get to choose the line parts like in old classic point & click adventure nor you don't see what you're about to say. It's not an important thing since you inevitably end up talking about everything with everyone but I kind of missed this option, as a Classic point & click lover. Resolution. Unfortunately the game has quite the age, you can't change any graphic detail, nor resolution. 4:3. Considering the age the other problem is the aspect ratio. Unfortunately it wasn't studied for 16:9 monitors. Speaking animations. I Have no idea if it's a problem caused by my OS (Win 10), the OS Bit (64bit), the modern hardware (Intel i5 + nVidia 840m) but when characters talk they move their mouth at the speed of light. literally. I can't distinguish the frames, they're super fast... ",497,128,12,20,23,4,28

												Quick review:Short Verdict: A point-and-click adventure with some strong and weak points. Overall, it was more frustrating and lame than fun, so ultimately I can't really recommend it. If you already have it (and SL2!), you might as well try and see for yourself. But I did think of abandoning the game quite a few times during it.IMPORTANT: The story ends with a huge cliffhanger, which I hope to be the starting point in Still Life 2. It doesn't even feel like an ending to a game, but to a chapter. So don't get/play this one if you don't plan on buying/playing the sequel.Pros: Although unoriginal, the story is interesting It was nice changing back and forth between the two ages in the game Some characters are interesting and well-developedCons: They've missed the mark on difficulty--puzzles are either ridiculously easy or insanely hard. Either way, it's never rewarding Lack of BGM on most scenes is lame Most of the game consists of moving back and forth to solve boring puzzles... and moving back and forth is a really slow process Some characters and dialogs are stupid The ending is really frustrating--seems like the end of a chapter Dialog system makes you click for each topic... but there's almost no topic do choose from. Basically, sometimes you have two options: left click for important dialogs, right click for idle chat. But most of the time it's just the left-click. So instead of going smoothly through the dialog, they make us click every three phrases just to pretend we're actually doing somethingBought on / for: Arctic Bundle by Bundle Stars, for an average price of US$ 0.36. For that much, yeah, it was worth it, but I wouldn't get it outside of a bundle.			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

I probably played it several times already and don't mind playing it again.It has great atmosphere with just perfect music behind it that made me really get into the story. Couple of times, it really scared me or had to cover my eyes.I tought the scenery of Franch back in 1920 was beautiful, moreover, it was excitinig to actually played the Gustav part not just reading his dialy.It was rather sad at the end of it, but with that included, I really liked the story. I recommend this game a lot! ",1,30,0,1,0,0,0

												One of the better point and click games. You actually see yourself walking, instead of gradually floating or jerking into the next scene like most point and clicks. The controls are easy to use, and the story is pretty cool. There are graphical glitches. Her hair starts spiking all over the place which annoys me immensly, and the police officers mouth at the beginning is actually kind of funny, reminds me of Garys Mod parody videos lol.

												I played a fair way in, but gave up on the puzzle where I had to MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE FOR MY BOSS.  And this wasn't even anywhere near the BEGINNING, like an early tutoring exercise in how to play the game.  This was a REAL PUZZLE.  Involving the exploration of MULTIPLE ROOMS.  Life really is too short.(PS  Full points, though, for the cliched big, dumb, burly black cop at the beginning who laughs non-stop for about twenty to thirty seconds...fully subtitled, no less.  That probably kept me playing a couple more hours at least...)Verdict: 4.5/10.			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												Still Life is one of my favorite Point & Click adventure I ever played. The story is really interesting, it have a mix of Detective vs Crime and horror element. Some of the puzzle can be quite challenging but well intergrated into the game, and fit the story very well.The part I love the most is that you follow 2 story from 2 different character and timeline, but both story are connected to the ""same"" killer. It have very nice and believeable environments and fitting soundtrack.You love Point & Click adventure and detective stuff with interesting story, This would be one of them you shouldn't miss! *_*			",168,96,3,51,18,1,13

												Still Life introduces you in a crazy serial killer case that went on for several centuries leaving bloody traces in different parts of the world recently leading to Chicago… You are playing the main character “Vic” who is an FBI Agent leading the investigation of the recent Chicago murders. She soon gets personally involved as her family seems to be connected to the investigation from the past. Here it is going to get really interesting. You are jumping back in time and witness some elaborated places in Prague in the 20’s playing Vic’s granddad who was the former PI in a very similar case. While stranded in the past and finding out how everything started you get interrupted by reality, just as new information comes up for our present investigation. While talking to possible suspects and witnesses, doing usual detective work (including going rogue after an argument with the boss, being suspended and facing the bad guys on your own), you will also discover some brutal murder scenes.You will be presented action scenes, outstanding storytelling and good character development. The gameplay requires some getting used to, especially the use of the inventory. While playing, you can easily miss out on objects, but you do not carry a lot of things at the same time, so putting everything in a useful combination is pretty obvious, but it did not bother me that much. And, like a typical point-and-click game, you also have to solve some puzzles (most people say this is unrealistic and dull, but I always like that most in such kind of games…).At first I thought it would be just a usual point-and-click adventure, but afterwards I would say it is one of the best games I played in a long time. The case you have to investigate is getting under your skin - I seldom played such a thrilling point-and-click adventure. Released in 2005 the graphics are not the finest, but it is still enjoyable. The amount of settings is enormous and I praise that the story kept its mystery elements until the end. The sound acting was really good, even though not always in sync. In contrast to the second part (I have not bought it yet, but it has lots of negative reviews, so…) you cannot do anything wrong with this game - especially if it is on sale.			",21,12,0,1,1,0,1

												Still Life follows the trail of a gruesome serial killer in a classic thriller/mystery style. You play as detective Victoria McPherson who is investigating a string of prosti tute murders, all of whom's bodies were found badly beaten and mutilated. The atmosphere is well done and each crime scene is quite graphic. The style of this game is a classic point and click adventure. As far as game play is concerned, adventure games tend to be vague and it can be difficult to figure out what you are supposed to do next, but that rarely happens in this title. In fact, in Still Life, it is usually very obvious what you are supposed to do - but that's the hard part. The puzzles in this game range from rather simple to frustratingly demanding. While the puzzles do become immensely complex, the puzzles are also very logical. I personally spent about 30-40 minutes trying to figure out one of the difficult puzzles in this game. So if you are going to play this title, you need to have patience and a strong penchant for puzzle solving. This isn't a title you can just rush through (unless you look up all the solutions, but that seems kind of silly). The graphics are a bit dated and the voice acting while good/ok, isn't top notch. About 8-10 hours playtime. 7.5/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			",66,50,1,8,4,0,7

												Still Life comes off as an eye spy detective game with several puzzle elements thrown into the mix. The 800x600 maximum resolution is disappointing. A game of this caliber with a 2005 release date on a PC platform deserves higher end graphical support.Character development is genuine providing a sense of realism, but there is a lack of involvement on the players part to really control events--the result is a lot of mindless clicking to advance conversations. You also have to do everything in a predefined order which in many cases seems pointless. For example you can't pick up certain objects until you discover a use for them and you can't leave certain areas without completing necessary tasks.Overall, it was worth the play through, but I became weary near the game's end due to the abrupt turnaround in the main character combined with minor game annoyances. The ending sets up for Still Life 2, but ultimately leaves a feeling of unfulfillment as a stand alone game.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												If you're a fan of classic point-and-click adventure games, you should try Still Life.  The plot revolves around an agent investigating serial murders in Chicago and discovering that her grandfather investigated the same type of murders in Prague decades ago. While the dialogue is pretty campy, the story is amazingly gripping at times and the pre-rendered backgrounds are extremely well done and atmospheric.  Smooth transitions between the Chicago story and Prague keep the game interesting as you uncover clues from the past and present, playing as both Victoria and her grandfather. Nothing can hurt your character but there were a few moments of dread as she searches through some intensely disturbing areas of the game and gets uncomfortably closer to finding the killer. Movement is a bit clunky though and there are times when you feel like you're waiting endlessly for her to reach her destination, even when can run (more like brisk jog). Also, lack of true ending - glad there is 2!			",54,71,1,34,15,0,9

												I want to say I recommend this game.  But honestly, I can't.  Yes, I really thought it presented an interesting and gripping mystery story.  Indeed, if it weren't for the quality of the story, I likely would never have finished the game.Because while the mystery is great and the characters are generally well-written, the game mechanics and overall implementation are really tedious.  I really try not to 'cheat' on these sorts of games, preferring to think things through, but there are numerous places where I had to resort to a walkthrough, either because I simply found no indication of a direction to go in whatsoever in-game, or because I couldn't figure out how the specific game-mechanics of a given puzzle were supposed to be manipulated.I really wish the gameplay had been designed as well as the story, because I think the story is great.  But unless you're really up to slogging through the clunky mechanics to get to that story, you might be best to pass on this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I loved the fact that the story was played both in the past and the present (I won't say more because I don't want to spoil it), so if you like a good adventure point and click game with a crime related storyline you should try this!

												I've played this game through several times over the years and still enjoy it. The game pulls off the link between the present and the past fluidly. The cut scenes were well done, even though at this point they are dated, they still draw you in. I think the only real flaw in the game is that sometimes you are left with no immediate purpose, and you wander from place to place until you find what you need to trigger the next step in the game. This is something that is present in most of the older point and click adventures, so I try not to let it keep me from enjoying the rest of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent adventure game. Interesting storyline. Some pretty humorous lines that made me chuckle. My only issue with it at the time was that the story/plot was incomplete but then they released a sequel so I was like, hm, okay I guess that explains it.The sad part is I didn't like the story enough to want to play the sequel.. So that tells you something. I might eventually get around to it though, as I bought them in a bundle.Overall, a slightly above mediocre experience. It kept me entertained but it wasn't something I'd personally recommend to anyone unless they were an Adventure game junkie and already played basically everything else.			",72,38,0,8,10,0,5

												A good adventure game with great atmosphere and some flaws. Some of the puzzles are not very clear about what you have to do, so there is a good probability you are going to use a walkthrough. A few ""trigger zones"" are easy to miss and you'll be searching for a new solution while you have already found it in the first place. Despite those flaws, the story is very good and it will make you want to continue till the end.The graphics are very acceptable and the only problem I encountered is some artifacts on the protagonist's hair. It looks like she has a spider web on her hair, but maybe it's my pc's specs. If you are on Windows 10 you have to enable DirectPlay from ""Turn windows features on or off"" in order to play the game (before or right after the installation).One last thing: if you want to conclude the story you have to play Still Life 2. So you should consider the bundle of the trilogy before you buy (Post Mortem is the prequel of Still Life 1).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spoiler free review:This game was interesting, and though it's older, it holds up OK :) It's a bit slow and the graphics aren't the best but it still holds up. The story is interesting enough, though the ending is a bit of a cop out to get you to play the second game. The port is OK, but a lot of times the walking messes up. I also found the walking painfully slow. I imagine 1/2 the time spent on the game, is walking. Semi-spoilerish points:I like the little dated references like the X-Files poster, and the windows screen savers. The storyline between present and past was really interesting. But in some spaces it had so much detail almost too much, and in others left giant holes. There are a few characters we meet that dont seem to do much for the story or progression at all but they are given big chunks. The ending felt like a bit of a copout for me. Side note I totally cant stand that they keep saying ""sweety"" and ""honey"" it makes no sense.			",13,62,0,2,1,0,0

												This game is a follow up to Post Mortem, and introduces a second playable storyline involving FBI agent Victoria McPherson. She is investigating a string of grisly murders in Chicago and this ties in to a case her grandfather, Gustav ""Gus"" McPherson worked whilst in 1920s Prague. It is a simple point-and-click type game that involve some rather puzzling puzzles to be solved along the way. The story itself is reasonably interesting, but the character development and voice acting are somewhat lacking. The ending seems to raise more questions than it gives answers, but it is, on the whole, an enjoyable game to play. The soundtrack/score by Tom Salta is particularly well-crafted, working brilliantly to convey the atmosphere of a scene.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After the disappointment of Post Mortem I was relieved to find this game is as great as I had been led to believe. In comparison to Post Mortem, this game still has a hard coded 4:3 aspect screen resolution but crucially it does not crash all the time when the game loses focus. The horrible first person camera is gone. The annoying branching dialogue that could result in you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off a character so you miss out on crucial information has been replaced with a much simpler system. The interface is generally much better all round. There are no randomly appearing items in this game which makes things more satisfying as instead of back tracking across every location you can just remember where you saw a suitable item.The story in this game is excellent, it really engaged me and kept me wanting to play on. The split between the two interconnected murder investigations was very well done.The puzzles are also very good, they are all very logical and don’t feel arbitrary. Most of them are quite simple but the more challenging ones take a bit of thinking about but are very satisfying.I did encounter one bug though. The mouth movements didn’t work properly, the characters either kept their mouths closed or they rapidly flickered open and closed. This is only a very minor thing and in no way detracts from this excellent point and click adventure. I don’t think you are going to miss out on anything significant if you entirely skip Post Mortem and just start with this game.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												All in all a good game, the engaging story and that gloomy mood the game has really keeps you going. The puzzles are mostly okay, although some of them are extremely annoying (like that friggin lockpick) or just plain unnecessary (like cooking gingerbread cookies in the middle of an investigation...), but these are not my main concern. No, the biggest problem is the ending. Microids has a tendency of ending their games abruptly (the first Syberia ended on a pretty much random place too), but I expected something different from an investigation game. Nothing is resolved, pretty much every question remains open.			",908,350,40,102,62,9,78

I searched google for mystery crime games and saw still life was highly recommended so I gave it a punt as its on sale at steam.What you get is a totally on rails point and click adventure with pointless puzzles, mouse clicking between every line of dialogue and dubious graphics.The characters are wooden, the dialogue delivery awful, the scenery is spartan and considering the 2004 release it's ten years old, even then.I'm half way through and, frankly, I couldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the characters or if whatshername even catches the killer.No ability to step outside the game mechanics.  I can't ask how an intruder is able to access the morgue but if I don't make some cookies I can't move to the next point and click segment.I'd rate it as 8 years + if it wasn't for the graphic images or the profanity.Avoid.

												When I first played this game, I thought to myself, ""These game makers REALLY liked 'Silence of the Lambs.'"" No there isn't a cool Hannibal character, but this game has a gritty realism to it. Most point and clicks deal with fantasy and sci-fi subjects and puzzles that would not be in real life. This is a point and click for adults if there ever was one. A serial killer with a twisted sense of art is on the loose and you are the agent who is going to stop him. This game does not shy away from gory details. Get ready for autopsies, visiting gory crime scenes, and delving into the mind of a lunatic. If thats not enough, get ready to visit some sketchy locations such as a house of ill repute with a serious S&M complex. Without spoiling the story, the game feelis like you are playing two games, since this game spans two time periods, and you are playing as two detectives. I love the look of the game. For those familiar with Syberia, expect the same level of excellence, just a completely different atmosphere. The cut scenes can be very exciting to watch. Some of the cut scenes can be gratifying to watch while others can be difficult. I believe this game is one of those overlooked gems that seriously needs more press.			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												Interesting beginning, boring end. Very linear adventure game with a classic ""detective"" story. Two time-lines are nice idea. Visual is not the best, but taking year of the origin, its quite alright. What is not OK is almost everything else. Dialogs can not be chosen what to say, you just click and click and listen. No interaction. Puzzles are most of the time dumb. The worst puzzle ever is baking cookies. WTF? Lockpicking is another messed up puzzle, that is not a fun to play. Gameplay is very slow, just waiting until your character goes over the screen (yes, you can run, but it is not much of an improvement). This is real game killer in last part game puzzles, where you wait like an idiot until your ""robot"" walks slowly to the position. 40%			",28,29,7,3,3,0,0

Since it is currently the Autumn Steam Sale I figured I write up a review for those currently looking to buy it.Still Life is a 3D interactive puzzle adventure that follows a single muder mystery case that unfolds from the perspective of two different characters, FBI Agent McPherson (In 2004 US Chicago) and her PI Grandfather Gustav McPherson (In 1920s Czech Rep Prague) . Neither of these two characters interact directly with the other; Gustav McPherson's story is told through diary.In general there's not much difference in gameplay that occurs during a switch of characters as it is mostly done for narritives sake. In terms of gameplay Still Life's is fairly weak. Much of the interaction in the game mainly comes from chosing the correct person to talk to, using the right items/objects and solving a few puzzles. The puzzles themselves are actually very well thought out and surprisingly difficult! I actually found myself at wits end on a puzzle and am ashamed to say that I actually had to find help online!Graphics wise Still Life looks quite dated now a days. A lot of the lip synching when a character speak looks incredible jarring. Mouths on some characters look more like nutcrakers when they talk.... On the flipside character models themselves are well designed and look quite decent too! Where Still Life really shines though is in the Pre renderded enviroments. If you're a fan of early Resident Evil games or like looking at background art in general, you will enjoy the look and immersion of the enviroments that the visual departments in Still Life offers.Though honestly the main reason anyone should really play Still Life would be for its story and characters! Over all I feel like the characterization of everyone in Still Life is done very realisticly. A lot of the dialouge does a very good job explaining the lives and personalities of the people they are suppose to represent. It's been more than a few months since I've played this game and though I can't recall completely by heart all the names of the characters; the use of the voice actors and the roles the characters played in the story themselves are embedded quite well into my mind. Also mild spoiler alert but I have to point this out as it's a slight♥♥♥♥♥♥move on the developers part. The story ends on a cliff hanger! You don't catch your murderer. You have to buy part two to wrap up this case. Because of this I recommend that if you want all of your monies worth that you buy this game when it is on sale. While it is a good game at telling a story and presenting convincing and unique characters, Still Life fails to completely maintain any interesting gameplay. The story doesn't suffer from it but sometimes you feel more like you're watching movie.I recommed this game but only buy it as the part 1&2 bundle and on sale.			",47,13,1,2,1,2,3

												Don't play this game if you want to solve a mystery:Spoilers Ahead:A point and click adventure in which you're hunting a serial killer.  As with most point-and-clicks, you will need to solve several puzzles in the game.  Some are well done, others are obvious filler and will arbitrarily bar your progress despite having no real bearing on the story.  The voice acting is terrible, the characters are terrible (some are outright racist), but if you're patient you may think that you can at the very least solve an interesting mystery.  Your patience is rewarded with an abrupt ending; you never discover who the killer was, a bunch of loose ends are left unresolved, and there's no closure.  Your reward is the credits.    Don't buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From the producers of Syberia, Still life is a point & click adventure game that it's as exciting as the former. There are a lot of locations involved and the level design is amazing. As regards to the story, this is a well-thought game. There aren't a lot of plot twists and the resolution of the story might seem a little unsatisfying for some, but the overall plot has a lot of strong points. What I liked the most out of this topic is the interwined stories of Victoria and his grandfather, and how everything is not as black and white as one might think. The puzzles are very good, but at times a little cryptic, just like some parts of the game where you are left wondering what to do next. But, despite the minor flaws, Still life is a very exciting adventure and it has a lot to offer to people that enjoy a good story and well developed characters.			",32,24,0,7,0,0,0

												Still life is a detective murder mystery that builds good suspense with an intriguing twisted story that is enjoyable to follow and solve. Still Life is a point-and-click adventure genre game; thus, a game more favorable to those who have ample patience for a slower paced game with a good amount of searching, exploring, and figuring out what to do next. Still Life also includes puzzles mixed within the game, with some being very difficult to solve. Most people will need a walkthrough to solve the harder puzzles. The graphics are not great, only having about average quality. Voice acting and dialogue range from fair to poor. Score: 7 out of 10			",288,116,1,58,26,0,65

												Okay, I've had two people ask me about this game since I've been playing it, so I figure I'll write a review for it..Simply put: One of the BEST ""point and click"" games I've ever played. Very, very rich in story line, characters, visuals, music......not what I expected at all.Much more ""mature"" than I figured, with curse words galore, graphic death scenes and a few cases of full frontal nudity even. Along with all that, though...one of the better stories in a game.Only slight con I'd say about it is the repetitiveness of having to go back to the same locations. But I guess that's what they have to do in real world police work.OH, and good luck on the LOCK PUZZLE...you'll know what one I mean when you reach it.If you can get through it without looking up a video walkthrough, I'll be impressed.

												 Still life has a good premise for the story and the fact that you actually play as two different characters from two different time periods adds a unique story telling element to the game. However, as with other Microid adventure games the game is filled with nearly empty screens with beatiful art and just 1 or 2 clickable objects. Also the very fact that the game actually does NOT end at the end really reduces the value of Still Life a lot. Most of the time the game holds your hand about what to do and where to go. So until you hit a puzzle or a weird item search sequence, Still Life is very similar to an interactive movie. Everytime during the game, you have a VERY limited set of options about where to go and what to click. As for the puzzles, while some of them are good there are several puzzles which hugely disrupts the narrative of the story (ex. a cookie baking puzzle). Also, the dialogues and characters are usually very one dimensional and filled with clichés.			",135,117,0,25,22,0,31

												If you've ever played an Adventure game before, you know what to expect. The controls are easy enough, you just point and click. In this game you play the role of an FBI agent investigating a serial murder case. This game is just full of mystery that just draws you in, and you just don't want to put it down, very addicting. There are some challanging puzzles to crack also. I bought this game during Steam's Holiday 2013 sale for $2.49, what a bargain, normal price is about $10.00, but you can double that because you're going to want Still Life 2 also. I nominated this game for an award.			",93,37,0,8,10,0,2

												The music and artwork are beautiful, but the gameplay is such an enormous slog that it ruins the experience.  Movement is painfully slow, which makes getting around an annoyance.  Most of the puzzles are incredibly obtuse and nearly impossible without a guide.  I was interested in the story (even with the terrible voice acting and dialogue) and kept going despite the tediousness only for the game to end without anything being resolved.  I won't be playing the sequel to finish the mystery.  Waste of time, waste of money.			",132,28,0,10,6,1,13

												I hesitantly recommend this game. Pros: Beautiful graphics Interesting story Some interesting characters Good music. Cons: The main character irritates me. I think she's supposed to come off as bada##, but IMO,  she really isn't. Some cliche, not so interesting characters. A lot of the puzzles don't give you enough information and make very little sense or they're just plain frustrating and annoying. To elaborate: At one point, you have to bake cookies. You have the recipe book in front of you, but instead of the actual ingredients, you have to putter around experimenting with different cup measures and measuring spoons because every single ingredient is in some sort of irritating code. Instead of the actual ingredients, you have things like ""add two cups of love"" and a ""teaspoon of generosity."" And love and generosity could be milk, cookies, cinnamon, ginger, sugar, etc. This puzzle also did nothing to advance the plot, it was just a fun, mandatory side quest. At the very end of the game, there is an especially irritating puzzle involving a robot. It made me extremely angry. So my main problem with this game was some of the puzzles. Is it worth playing? I have my doubts, but the game did enough right that I can't bring myself to give it a thumbs down.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												3/5 stars. This game was originally released in 2004 and has aged well. It's a standard graphic adventure game wherein you walk the protagonist around various locations, collect items and solve classic puzzles.Pros: Good story/characters. The graphics are still acceptable. Puzzle difficulty increases as the story progresses. Gameplay length is acceptable: You'll get a minimum of 4 hours from it. A PDF walkthrough is included with your purchase.Cons: Can't play in windowed mode. The resolution is locked at 1024x768, making the graphics a bit grainy on a 1920x1080 desktop. 95% of the f-bombs and exposed breasts are gratuitous and exterraneous to the tale. A couple hiccups in the French-to-English translation (re: the cookie recipe uses metric tools but gives you imperial instructions.)Microids ""Syberia"" series is far superior so buy that instead. If you've already completed those, then pay around $5 for Still Life and you'll be happy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't understand why this game is so well respected among some adventure gaming types. It sucks. Hard. It sells itself as a video game CSI type adventure and it is..for exactly 20 minutes at the start, but then it turns into one of the worst adventure games I've ever played (seriously, there's actually a Christmas cookie baking puzzle in this). The bad acting is maybe forgivable, but not so the plot which is a tedious hodgepodge of warmed over serial killer film clichés, the terrible dialogue, and the horrible out of context ""puzzle"" puzzles (I don't mind overt puzzles when they fit the narrative, but why, for example, would construction workers lock their crane using an elaborate logic puzzle rather than, you know, a key?). And on top of this it doesn't even have the decency to have a real ending. Instead, it just kind of ends abruptly leaving all mysteries entirely unsolved. Anyone who says this is good should be sentenced to an eternity of solving its lock-picking puzzle.			",214,85,2,68,14,0,27

												So lets get one thing straight. This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥The story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ the ending is♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game mechanics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ the puzzles are♥♥♥♥♥♥ the voice acting is♥♥♥♥♥♥and it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥But I liked it.Now let me explain myself. This isn't a game you want to pick up expecting anything worth a damn. If you pick this up thinking it will do more than waste a good 7hrs (Thats with looking up the majority of the puzzles because I'm lazy) you will be sorely disappointed.But what it does is entertain, made me laugh like a retard at chuckie cheese for several points. Not because it was well done, but because it was so poorly done. Play this game just to notice flaws, laugh at the sheer retardation of the entirety of it, and enjoy yourself.But if you wanna be a downie debbie and demand perfection from your games, do not buy this.But if you want just a fun♥♥♥♥♥♥game you don't feel guilty blasting through with a walkthrough for the puzzles, just to laugh at its sheer unrelatable in any way circumstances, you could do ALOT worse.Picked up the second one to see if they managed to keep it nice and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like this one.

												How to even start? I can't recommend this game at all, and I'm writing this review as an outlet for my overwhelming disappointment more than anything else. If it helps you decide about this game: bonus. I understand it's part of a trilogy, but honestly, I played this one first and I'm never going to bother with the other two for the bad taste this one left. Short Version: Don't. The puzzles aren't good and the characters are bad. The story is disappointing and it doesn't end. Not even a little; so no satisfying victory for you.Long Version:If you're into point & click, puzzles, mysteries and crime, this game is going to look like Christmas until you actually start playing it. I picked it up because my gf and I like all of the things it was supposed to be, and it had so many good reviews! Reading over those reviews now, I feel like I must have played a completely different game.If you're still reading, here are some of the reasons I recommend you look elsewhere for whatever it is you're after:Pace - This game is slow even if you play it as quickly as you can. It will not let you do anything out of order or sooner than it thinks you should. You will have solved most of the puzzles before they've started, but often you'll have to talk to a specific person, or look at a specific thing before the main character will go 'oh, I should do blah' and only THEN can we proceed. So really, the puzzle is trying to get to start the puzzle?Puzzles - They're not hard, some of them are tedious, and they're not really story relevant. Also, there aren't very many of them, so it's less of a puzzle game and more of a walk around simulator. There isn't any outside-the-box thinking here and when I say story relevant I mean the puzzles you complete to progress the story don't make sense within the story itself. Which brings me to the third and most serious offenderStory - Dear. God. Okay, so this is the part that broke the game for us. Somewhere in this game is a really interesting story about some disturbed people killing other people all tied together with art and family. It should be awesome, but you don't really get to be a part of that story and the best parts of the game are when you're reading journals and speculating on who the big bad is. One of the characters you play as, Gus, is actually pretty interesting. He takes you along through his section of the mystery and he makes sense as a character. He's a private eye, not a cop, and he does some not exactly legal stuff to get ahead of the killer before more people are hurt. People he loves are being directly impacted, so you get his urgency and interest. We could get behind that; it wasn't always great, but it made enough sense for Prague in the 20's. The other character is Victoria. You're with her most of the game, and she might be the single worst federal agent in the history of terrible representation of the FBI. At the beginning it's not so bad: she clearly has a lot of personality and not a lot of respect for authority, which is a staple for cop characters, fine. But that lack of respect leads her out on a ridiculously elaborate and illegal adventure that should land her in jail except SPOILERS: she off-handedly blackmails her boss. It becomes ridiculous and farcical that she could carry on the way she does and not face criminal charges. She never calls for backup or phones things in (like murders?), she tampers with evidence, leaves key witnesses in the protection of her boyfriend rather than, I dunno, the police? Not only is she not ‘by the book’, she’s never seen it, she is illiterate as far as ‘the book’ is concerned and you have to suspect the only reason she’s in the FBI is because he dad is the DA. She's just awful, and it was a struggle to finish the game with her because everything she did was insane and unrealistic. It kills any suspension of disbelief you might have had and in the end, the only person you feel like you have enough evidence to convict is yourself.This game could have, but didn’t. It has some nice art though, so I guess there’s that. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good Crime Adventure. You play as FBI Agent Victoria McPherson and your job is it to  catch a brutal psychokiller. As FBI Agent you have many tools to investigate a crime scene. Blood traces, finger prints and more you have to find and analyse.The game is not just a FBI simulator, it's still an adventure.With an inventory where you have to combine stuff and so on. You need to find passwords, you have to solve puzzles and you have to talk to everyone. This game is not for kids cause of some nudity and gore crime scenes. You will also play as Victorias Grandfather in some flashbacks.Some parts of the game are not easy and the story will not continue if you miss a little piece or an evidence but nothing is impossible.You should play Still Life 2 directly after this one.8/10			",1213,488,72,153,192,15,219

												Highly recomend this game. Graphic settings are old but does not spoil the game.Story line excellent and the puzzles although difficult in some cases are all solvable with the evidence given. Nice switch of characters between chapter 1 and 2 looking forward to completing and trying number two.9/10Now having to change my review as now come across a stupid puzzle that requires you to navigate a robot through a virtually invisible laser field. Totaly stupid and no way to bypass. Destroyed about a thousand robots and still no luck.A good adventure/puzzle game ruined by a stupid eye hand co-ordination puzzle.5/10			",71,25,0,18,27,0,28

												So I bought this game while I was drunk and very bored a few years ago for about a dollar. This was the single worst decision I have ever made in my entire life. I highly recommend not touching this game whatsoever. The whole time I was playing I spent trying to skip the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue so I could get to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""move your mouse over the clue"" gameplay. The voice acting is so bad that you might as well put the game on mute and read the subtitles which aren't any better. Better yet, dont' even bother playing it. I wish I could go and undo this purchase so that it's no longer a constant reminder to drink and play video games during steam sales. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ you steam, you reeled my broke♥♥♥♥♥in again while i was hammered. On another note I should probably stop drinking. This game is so bad that is made me stop drinking. Most people would call this a positive thing, but ♥♥♥♥ you I love drinking. I also love playing video games. This game left me stumbling around town sober and not wanting to see a single screen lest it might contain something close to digital entertainment for fear that it could bring back painful memories. I'm a complete wreck now. I had to build up the courage to crack open a cold one and write a review for this game. NEVER AGAIN STEAM, NEVER AGAIN! There's a reason nobody makes games like this anymore. They're terrible, they're boring, and they're so linear that it defeats the purpose of even existing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is racist. The game's original dialog is in French. The translation to American English was not a responsible or subtle one. I made it to just past the opening credits when the first character the protagonist comes in contact with is an American black police officer. It appears that those responsible for the translation are only familiar with American black people through 19th century minstrel shows. As I can only find one review that discusses this atrocious characterization, and they only refer to it as ""borderline racist,"" I feel some responsibility to inform the Steam community (a community that I consider mostly comprised of responsible and open-minded game consumers) to think twice before purchasing something so offensive. This racism is not borderline, it's outright and unacceptable.			",129,71,0,27,13,0,41

												Loved it, will play it again.I had some very nice hours on a friday night and the following saturday with this.The protagonist has a great humor presented in a sympathic voice ( which I missed in Still Life2), the other characters are charming and made with care too.The riddles in this game kept me thinking and trying, they are in good balance and challenged me without frustration. I also liked the artwork and how it is included in the game ( there were some paintings I stared at for minutes just because I liked them and had the time to do so- thank you guys for those!). The only sad thing about this game is that the following game (Still Life 2) has lost a lot of the charm the first one has to provide. I fullheartedly recommend the game. ",4,18,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant!Well worth the 75p I paid for it (bought it in bundle on 90% off) but in all honesty I would buy it at it's normal price in a heartbeat. Wonderfully gothic murder mystery. The non ending is a bit of an anticlimax, but it has made me eager to play the second installment. Who of us haven't wanted to tell our bosses to go fornicate themselves? That was the punch the air moment for me. Without wanting to give to much away the story was grusome in places, but made my heart break too. Puzzles were tricky but not overly troublesome. Which if you have little patience shouldn't deter you from the story too much. Give this little gem a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.			",37,84,0,31,1,0,18

Yeah I found that mechanism annoying at times, but it allowed for a personal touch. Still life was great, although I didn't like how every mechanism was only used once. We used black lights, plastic machine, finger prints and etc. and all of them are barely even used. It is completly on rails with few puzzles along the way. Of course I used a walkthrough cause I was in a hurry to get to the puzzles and unfold the story quicker, but you can easily tell why this game isn't that popular, and only a little game that is only relevent because Steam is around, and cheap gamers looking for cheap games.

The graphics are good, except for the character models, but you never see much of those up close anyway.  It's mainly background graphics, which all look good.  The story is a bit lame though.

												I love love love it. The puzzles are just enough to leave you mind-boggled, but happy once you figure them out. I admit to using a key with one in particular, the opening the lock puzzle, but otherwise--the rest were easy to figure out. Admittedly, not the best graphics to look at--but for the time the game was made, it's pretty good. The story is twisted and weird, and I love how you jump back to old-time to real-time with it. It gives you two knock out stories that twine together to make the game delicously devouring!			",3,8,0,4,1,0,0

												At first I started of disappointed with the game it started out quite slow and didn't give me the same thrill I got from Syberia, but it picks up quickly and you're thrown in to a world of intriguing mystery and psychological thriller. I enjoyed the cinematic angle with parallels between Victoria and her Grandfather. My 2 biggest complaints with this game were, firstly that transitioning to different areas on the map were unnecessarily drawn out every time, this is frustrating when you're not certain where you're meant to be going and you head to the wrong place. and secondly I'm not particularly sensitive to ethnic portrayals but I did find the only 2 black character who appeared in this game to be somewhat a racist stereotypical portrayal which made me slightly uncomfortable. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed the game and look forward to playing the second one.			",28,24,0,6,3,0,3
