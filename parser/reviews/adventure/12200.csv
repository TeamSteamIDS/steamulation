												Bully. It's GTA, but without blood and deadly weapons, and instead of playing as an adult man, you play as Jimmy Hopkins. A 15 year old kid who's aggressive and a fighter, but not truly malicious. He only gives people what they have coming to them.Bully takes place in Bullworth, a town in New England. Your mom, well, Jimmy's mom, drops you off at Bullworth Academy. A boarding school. The school is full of bullies and corrupt teachers and it's up to you to put a stop to it.The game's storyline will guide you through six chapters (There are 65 missions, the sixth chapter is an endless free-roam chapter, giving you the chance to complete non-storyline missions and to collect collectables.) Each of them takes place in a different weather season. The missions vary, it's never the same. One time you're cleaning a rat infested library and the next time you're helping a teacher escape from a psychiatric hospital. As Jimmy, your main goal is to bring peace to the school by helping and befriending the four school cliques: The Nerds, the Jocks, the Bullies and the Preppies.Of course you'll have to go to class. These classes are: English, gym, geography, math (ew), music, shop, art, photography and biology. They are simple mini-games which become noticeably harder every time you attend them and make progress. You'll also have to deal with a time schedule. You can skip class, but you won't get any rewards if you do so and prefects will chase you down and send you back to class if they catch you.Jimmy, your character, is highly customizable. You can buy clothes, change your hairstyle and more. You can even buy a bike, a go-kart or a scooter if you save up enough cash. Money can be earned by either taking a paper route, doing missions for townies or students or by completing storyline missions. You've got weapons. No, they are not guns and no you can't kill people. There's a super slingshot, you can use firecrackers, stink bombs, eggs, a bag of marbles, a bottle rocket launcher and so much more. You can also pick up one of the many objects around you (umbrella's, vases, bottles) and use them as a weapon.Interacting with your fellow students is fun too. You can talk to them, give cute presents, put them in trash bins or lockers, steal their books, take their pictures for the yearbook, punch them in their faces (aka bully them) and if you feel like it you can make out with a girl or a guy. The game has a very impressive map size. You can explore the entire school, the school grounds, the town, a fully functional theme park, an industrial park and a few more awesome places. There are many collectables scattered around the map too.Bully may be pretty good, but it's not perfect. The graphics are rather outdated, the sound isn't that amazing, the controls are a bit clunky at first and there are some bugs. But don't worry! It doesn't kill the fun. Bully is an amazing game and there's much to do. And for only $14.99 - £9.99 - €9.99, it's certainly worth it. I highly recommend this game. ",68,5,3,2,16,0,4

												I love Bully. It is my favorite open-world game and is my favorite game of all time. I love Red Dead and GTA, but not everyone has been a cowboy or a criminal, but everyone's gone to school. You may not relate excatly to Jimmy but you will relate to him more than John Marston or any GTA character. Also the level of customization is something I havent really seen in any other Rockstar games, making Jimmy your Jimmy and interesting. I have played this to death, and you should too.

												One of the best sandbox-style games I've ever played! Bully beautifully weaves tweaked Grand Theft Auto gameplay with the universally relatable life story of young Jimmy Hopkins. The setting of a fictional New England boarding school and the nearby town of Bullworth are perfect for this kind of story, following Jimmy as he faces the same challenges that every kid faces growing up, like keeping up with schoolwork, fighting back against bullies, experiencing your first kiss, causing chaos through pranks and hijinks, and finding acceptance between various cliques and social groups.The writing is brilliant, supplying a colorful cast of characters, missions, and story arcs. Including Jimmy himself, all of the NPCs seem practically handcrafted with the amount of personality and detail put into them. Each character has a unique model, and their own unique set of dialogues and animations. On top of these fantastically created characters, the plot is just as good. I was immersed into a world that I could have sworn was from an 80's Hollywood flick, drawing inspiration from coming-of-age tales like those of Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Catcher in the Rye. With such a wonderfully realistic world full of jocks, preps, nerds, and other odd townfolk, I almost wish that my own school days growing up were as interesting as those of Bullworth Academy.The gameplay is just as entertaining, using similar mechanics to GTA, such as a wanted system (called Truancy, of course), a combat system filled with a diverse array of punches, throws, and weapons at your disposal, different vehicles, mini-games, and other various activities and collectibles for completionists. As usual, there are missions given by various NPCs, some advancing the main story, and others being small side activities. Camera angles can be strange at times, but I've never experienced any gamebreaking issues with it. Overall, the gameplay has enough variance where it doesn't get too repetitive, and it strikes a nice balance that makes it both interesting and easy to pick up.Compared to other open-world games, Bully is by far my favorite. One of the few titles I've been compelled to complete 100%. If you're looking for something different in the same vein of games such as Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row, and the like, I highly recommend looking into Bully: Scholarship Edition. You won't be disappointed.			",126,44,2,12,9,2,17

Posted: January 8, 2015
												Welcome to Bullworth Academy. You play as a 15 year old thug of a kid named Jimmy Hopkins in this third person open world beat-em-up. Sure you get plenty of weapons like the slingshot, eggs, stink bombs that prevent enemies from attacking, firecrackers, a potato cannon and even a bottle rocket launcher, but you'll be spending most of your time brawling. The game is Bully, but you're more of an avenging angel. Sticking up for the weak, but following missions from pervert teachers, and the local crazies. Its the characters in Bully that really make the game stand shoulder to shoulder with Grand Theft Auto games. There is also plenty to do outside of the story missions. Bike races, collect-a-thons, arcade games that are worthy of their own games, classes that are really mini games that will unlock things for you and even a camera so you can take photos of every dumb thing you'll see. Instead of mayhem and murder like the GTA franchise, Bully is more of criminal mischief and knocking people unconscious. You don't even brutally win fights, enemies just fall over. You can finish them off with a childish noogie, putting them in a headlock and spitting on them or one of the many other silly ways.The game plays similar to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas meets the Warriors. You have jump and run buttons. An attack that you can hold for a strong attack. A target lock on for projectile weapons. If you don't have one equipped, it becomes a block button when you're not attacking. A free aim button for your sling shots, eggs and so on. A grapple button for when enemies block. You can shove someone when grappled. A taunt button that you can also take them down if grappled. Its a nice simple combat system. A local bum will teach you better attacks when you find and bring him radio parts. Your wrestling coach will teach you grapples in class. The items in your inventory are easy to select on the fly. You can also pick up things like bats and bricks to use and throw. You can even make peace by talking or bribing your way out of things. When you need health, just drink a soda or find some food.The game is broken up into chapters, the first chapter takes place exclusively in the academy, but chapter two opens the gates and lets you into the rich side of town. Chapter three unlocks the poor side of town and chapter five unlocks a large industrial side of town. There's not only a sense of progression from parts of the town opening up, but the game takes place over a year and you'll see the seasons change. You'll participate in Halloween, slide around in the winter and see spring return.Each chapter focuses on a faction and there are plenty of them. Nerds in green, bullies in white, greasers in leather jackets, preps in aqua berry and jocks in blue. Each faction has their own turf at the academy, and outside the academy as well. There are even factions outside of academy that will rise against you. All factions have a respect level for you. The less respect, the more likely the members will chase after you wanting a fight! Story missions will always change a faction's respect for you. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.Since this is an open world game you'll be doing a lot of traveling. The main way is by foot. You need to mash the run button to go fast. The enemies all run as fast as you do, but luckily they have stamina and Jimmy doesn't. You quickly unlock a skateboard that sits in your inventory. Its much quicker, but can't go upstairs without a sweet jump or over muddy terrain. There are also bikes, but the bikes feel few and far between. You can throw someone off a bike and steal it, or you can buy a bike, but then it sits in a garage, making it useless when you need to visit a garage in town when you're at the school most of the time. Other than that, you can ride lawn mowers and mopeds. It all feels like a balance. To get speed you button mash. If you're on a lawn mower you're stuck going slower than walking. If you're on a moped you need a helmet or the cops will be after you.Speaking of laws, there are plenty. You have typical laws against violence, but there are also truancy and curfew laws too. The game lets you know what your offense is on a three step 'wanted' level. When your wanted level hits red, then you can't struggle against the authorities. When they catch you that's it. On campus there are perfects, that act like the police. They'll bring you to class if you're truant, chase you for a dress code violation like wearing a chicken head and stop you from bullying. Sometimes them bringing you to class is more efficient than running to it. When you're in violation, you'll see not only the authorities highlighted on the mini map, but their vision cones. The game makes use of stealth on some missions, but for the most part, its just avoiding the gaze of the cops and perfects. You can even hide in lockers, the trash or dressers in the girl's dorm.The game is really set to a timetable that can sometimes break the flow. You wake up in the morning and have two classes in the day. You need to find a bed to sleep and if it gets too late, Jimmy will fall asleep where he is and wake up the next day. You can skip classes, but then the authorities will be after you. I felt stuck and forced to partake in the mini games. I want to point out that the class mini games are entertaining and some are educational, but having them forced upon you when I'm trying to do a mission seems a bit much. You can learn things from the game. Such as the flags to different countries in geography, a boggle like make a word with letters in English and even how to dissect animals in biology. I'm not saying this will replace schools by any means. There are also typical timed button press mini games that are less impressive. The game offers a wide array of mini games, even games that parody other games, such as Paperboy, Punch Out and dodge ball! There are even random people that will give you side jobs, like throw 3 nerds in lockers, deliver 3 fries, collect 5 crabs, and so on. All fluff.The money feels useless. You can spend it on weapons, but why bother when he has an arsenal in his dorm room from completing mini games? There are expensive clothes to buy and tattoos, but why bother other than for cosmetic reasons? Sometimes the game forces you to dress a certain way or get your hair done at the barber shop. You can't buy real estate, even if you can clear out a gang hideout to make it a new save point safe house.There are dozens of characters in the game. In fact every random person has a name and schedule. You can even take pictures of all of them for the yearbook. Most of the characters are downright evil with a few exceptions. Garry, the over the top villain with an eye scar that lies to cause trouble. Petey, the short effeminate best friend. The drunk Santa. The alcoholic English teacher. The two timing dame that uses men. Russell the big dullard so dumb he calls himself Russell. Its all done in a tongue in cheek 1950s stereotype. The game feels very 1950s even with its awful happy beach guitar riffs. It didn't take me long to turn turn the music down to 10%.I managed to sink around 17 hours into this game, but I've gotta be honest, I wanted to be done a long time ago. I just spend too much time traveling and wasting too much time doing mini games. At some point I stopped going to class just so I could grind through the missions efficiently. Then the missions started getting further and further. Consuming more precious time that Jimmy is awake during the day. Doing missions back to back so late just means that Jimmy would fall asleep on the street. There are also a few game breaking bugs that would cause the game to freeze or downright crash. Not frequent, but at specific points. I still recommend the game for an open world mischief sandbox that lets you do wedgies, throw firecrackers in toilet and slap kick me signs on people, then watch them get beat to a pulp.

												I love this game! Probably the best Rockstar game I have ever owned and played. Has an amazing story that just keeps getting better and better. Great characters, can connect to mostly all of them. Very nice gameplay. I enjoyed playing this and would play it again in a few months or so. I never got bored of playing this beautiful game. This game takes place mostly in Bullworth Academy. Playing as the main character, Jimmy Hopkins, a 15-year old teen who  fights the bullies, and saves the weaks. Taking over cliques and bringing peace into Bullworth. Now these are my Pros and Cons. Pros: Amazing GameplayNice weaponsSaving LocationsGood MoralityGreat CharactersGreat StoryVery Interesting and FunnyAddictingChallengesTrust and RelationshipsDialogue = AwesomeCons: (OPINION)Crashes once in a whileFreezesGames would not saveA tiny bit of a delay in dialogueAnyway, I would definitely recommend this game! :D~Kibbles			",14,0,1,0,0,0,0

												Definitely in my top 10 favourites games. Ever.I can spend hours and hours in this and never get bored.It's good on any platform (speaking from experience e.g. Wii, PS2, PC, etc), but a warning, surround sound seems to be a bit messed up on this, so make sure you set your audio to 2.0.Other than that, it's not a half bad port. The framerate is capped to 30, but understandbly so for a console port. It can be uncapped with mods. The pc controls still work fluently once you know them well, and can easily be rebound for preference. Though, I do recommend using a controller for a better experience.So much love, care, and effort went into this game. It's so great.			",273,23,3,28,14,3,21

												I have played this game fully on the PS2, Xbox 360 and I now bought it on PC.As far as the differences here, the graphics, load times, and overall enjoyment on the game are quite higher than 360 and Ps2 for obvious reasons. However, that being said, this game is capped off at 30 FPS unless some modding is involved. From a game back in 2006-2008 days it's not surprising though.This game is very fun, it's refereshing compared to GTA, imagine GTA instead of Guns you have sling shots and stink bombs, and instead of car jacking you have bikes and skate boards.The game is rich and very open world later on in the seasons of the game.There are many fun interesting missions in the game just like GTA.The premise of the game is a troubled kid was sent to a reeform school and is forced to take over and unite the school, removing all the ""Clicks"". Each season involves a click, from the bulies to nerds, to preps, its a long fun game that is well worth the money.This falls under the old GTA system that requires a save after the missions no check points are really there, so failing a mission at the end means re-doing the entire mission.Music used is fitting along with the sound effects.This has controller support for the 360 and Xbox One as well.Graphically speaking this is the best version but its still aged, however pretty good for its time.Overall I would say definitely worth the money. An A+ rating from me.			",375,125,6,68,65,5,58

												Bully, otherwise known as Canis Canem Edit on the PS2 version, is the one Rockstar game that really, truly, honestly stands out. Think of it as a sort of GTA, but as a school. Sure, you don't jack cars and bang some hookers, but you do ride around on a radical skateboard and shove fat kids into lockers. Pros: +Pretty good graphics, overall.+The classes (minigames) are totally awesome! Scholarship Edition adds some new ones, like Geography.+You never see ANY duplicated NPC's standing next to each other. Completely awesome.+Tons of depth. Every single NPC has a name. ALL OF THEM.+The characters are bright and colorful. Everyone loves Mr. Galloway, and everyone hates Mr. Hattrick.+The storyline is great! I love it, and it was very carefully written.+You can kiss girls (and boys, if you're into that) for health, which really gives an authentic high school feel.+RADICAL SOUNDTRACK! Shawn Lee is a beast!+Very lively city and school. You can see people getting chased down by cops/prefects, random fights, some kids pulling pranks. Very alive. Sadly, with every game, there are cons. -Nerd Challenge for me is truly frustrating, as ConSumo is kinda difficult.-Frame rate is only capped to 30 frames.-Cameraman is obviously on drugs, as sometimes the camera freaks out. I literally failed a mission,  Comic Klepto,  just because the camera went spontaneously and very quickly kept flipping back and forth, left to right. I crashed into a wall and failed the mission. All within 20 seconds. Camera is a little janky.-Once you're done with all the classes, missions, and have everyone's respect to 100, it kinda feels bland and empty.-Having low/negative respect with a clique can get pretty annoying, as they always pummel you wherever you are.-Prefects will constantly yell at you for being tardy to class, even if it's 1 second (in game minute) off.Bully, gets a  8/10! Definitely worth picking up. Get it now!			",88,12,1,7,10,0,7

												Bully is a great game and if you havent checkd it out what the hell are you waiting for ? in Bully you play as a teenager named Jimmy Hopkins. His mother and step father goes on a honeymoon leaving Jimmy to attend the Bullworth acedamy, meeting a kid named Gary who wants the school all to himself and of course hes gonna use you for his plan. Overall this game is great The combat feels smooth and the gun combat does feel smooth. The only real problems i found were sometimes the controls felt a bit stiff and the sound issues do ruin the game a bit. The game also has bonus collectibels, side quest, classes to go to, drivable bikes and skateboards and many more things in the world of Bully. Overall this game is fantastic just a few minor glitches but definatly you need this game in youre collection i give Bully 8.5/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Bully is one of my favorite video games. I love the town, the characters, the gameplay, and most importantly the story. Unfortunately the game does not run well on Windows 10. With constant crashes, I often found myself trying to get to the nearest save point after every mission so I wouldn't have to replay it. The game has crashed on me at least two dozen times during my playthrough. I have had to replay several missions and redo several classes because of this, making the experience unappealing. On top of that I have experienced several graphical and audio bugs in the game.That being said, the game is still amazing. If you're a fan of Rockstar games, this is one you should check out, especially if it goes on sale. It's hard to dislike this game even with all the issues I had. I kept going back to it. However, I recommendation saving very often because it is a nuisance when you have to replay a couple of missions because the game crashed. I played this game several years ago when it first came out. I was young at the time so the game seemed difficult. When rebought the game on Steam this year, it was a lot easier than I remembered. Most of the missions can be completed in under 20 missions. I even completed some in less than 10 minutes. Some of the classes were harder than some of these levels. This does not mean the game is bad.One of the best aspects of Bully is the story. To not ruin too much of the story, it's a typical coming of age/trying to find your way kind of story about a high schooler named Jimmy Hopkins. He goes out of his way for nearly everyone in the game. His ultimate goal is peace amongst the groups in school. I highly recommend this game and you should check it out if you have the opportunity!			",125,11,0,11,13,0,8

												It's rare that a developer goes from making an adult game about crime with very adult themes, to making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example, Bully is a open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play and much more to just find and explorer. The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions, like the Jocks or the Nerds, and the more you do with them, the more reputation you gain, which in turn effects how other people treat you around campus.The combat is also very similar to GTA, but instead of machine guns and rocket lunches, you are playing with slingshots and stink bombs.There are also lots of things different about Bully that really makes it feel like you are back in high school. It feels very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. You have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class. All of the classes have their own perks, for instance, completing one class will show you where all of the collectibles are on the map.Unlike the protagonists in GTA, Jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep, so if you are out past 2AM, you just pass out on the spot which can make some nigh missions feel a little too time restrictive but adds to the challenge.I did't have any technical issues with Bully like a lot of people complain about on this port. Overall the game is well made but parts of it seem kind of repetitive, but I still think this is a fantastic game.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												Hell of a lot of fun. One of the few sandboxes that I've actually finished.Bully takes place in the town of Bullworth in New England, possibly in 1970-1980s. That's never been made clear but nevermind. You're a boy that's basically dumped into this boarding school by your mother. You have to gain respect among your new mates while avoiding getting to trouble with the teachers. Basically GTA with criminals replaced by nerds, jocks, greasers and rich inbreds and police replaced by teachers, but there's more.The town itself is also part of the game world and it offers the player lots of optional missions and some larger story missions also take partly place there. Every day you have lessons according to your curriculum and it's up to you if you are to attend those or just play hooky, go have fun and risk the punishment. The lessons provide you some nice bonuses upon completion (especially chemistry), so it pays to take the classes and if you're quick, you have time to go downtown at the end of the day anyway.The game is heavily story-driven, but it's a fun experience and you do have all the time in the world to grind yourself silly before advancing the story if that's your idea of fun. Only the end felt a bit rushed and way too much of wish-fulfillment fantasy, but it isn't a deal-breaker. Bully is a very fun romp that feels like a game version Animal House, if Animal House took place in a boarding school instead of university. The game also reminded me somewhat of the old Jennings book series, if that is at all familiar.Bully is frequently on sale and for a couple of bucks/euros you really can't go wrong if you like sandbox games at all. The game is a console port, but it works fairly well. The controls may seem weird at first if you're using keyboard, but they're easy and responsive once you get used to them.

												Oh man this is game from my childhood. One of the best rockstar games in my opinion. Hell who doesnt want to run round a school kicking the crap out of bullies. This game is effectively GTA set in a High school. Graphicaly this game is pretty good (giving how old it is now) but as with most rockstar games, the assets are really low poly with really good textures on them. 7.5/10If you have never played this game, you MUST buy it.

												Bully is a game made by Rockstar, the development studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series. One of the many differences with GTA and this game is that instead of having deadly weapons you'll get weapons to prank and bully every kid in the block, the violent is toned-down too which is quite understandable since the game is set in a school setting.The game takes place at the fictional New England boarding school, Bullworth Academy and tells the story of mischievous 15-year-old Jimmy Hopkins as he goes through the hilarity and awkwardness of adolescence. Beat the jocks at dodge ball, play pranks on the preppies, save the nerds, kiss the girl and ultimately navigate the social hierarchy in the worst school around. Bully is divided between six chapters and many different missions which takes place in certain weather season much like Mafia II. As Jimmy Hopskins, a 15 year old mean bully, you are free to roam around the school or complete your classes like what normal student do or do what you do best, skip class and bully.There is no denying that the game is a console port but a well-made one. The controls is a bit weird but you'll get to it eventually once you get used to them. The game is a bit repititive but that's just a minor problem I had with the game.			",293,77,10,55,26,3,55

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is a Rockstar Games production, which originally was released for the Playstation 2 in 2006, and for the PC in 2008. You play in third-person as Jimmy Hopkins, a scrappy, teenager who attends Bullworth Academy, a school of bullies. You join and fight for different groups such as; Jocks, Preppies, and Nerds, and complete missions and objectives  to help bring peace to the various factions within the school, as well as the town of Bullworth itself. The story is interesting and portrays Jimmy as a protagonist and at times antagonist as well. Bullworth is a fictional town, which is supposed to exist somewhere in the Rockstar created Grand Theft Auto Universe. The game comes with a single player mode, competitive multiplayer, as well as various mini-games. The Scholarship Edition uses a newer game engine than the original, and feels a lot like a GTA game at times. Graphically speaking, it is a 2008 game, so it's 8-years-old right now, and it looks like it, but it is still fun to play. The PC port feels different than the original PS2 version, and seems a little off, but that could just be because of the different engine used on the port. It's still a fun game and if you enjoyed the original, you should enjoy the PC Port as well.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Bully is an open world school simulator of some sort where you bully people. Well no, Bully is like Grand Theft Auto, except you play as a 15 year old academy student who is placed on the worst school in the country because his mom and stepfather decided to go on a honeymoon, and they needed a place where they could set him off.In Bully you're set to do typical favours and missions to earn status around the school so people won't be bullying eachother anymore, and as far as that goes; not so well. So while you're on your mission for success in school, you still have the normal school courtesy to go to classes, skip classes and you will be punished to do school chores around the place.During free roam, the game allows for a ton of stuff you can do outside the school after doing certain missions, and it is in great fun to do so collecting odd things to get some random stuff.PROS:-Great soundtrack-Long and fun game-Has things to do when you get bored of missions-Freedom to do what you want-Fun side activites-Fitting atmosphereCONS:-Few bugs here and there-PC controls are horrying, get a controller if you have-PC controls are bad-Did I mention PC controls?'All in all, I would rate this game 9/10.

There's just constant crashes, i've tried every fix and unless you limit the game to two cores and run at 800x600, all you're going to do is crash.It's very unfortunate, but unless Rockstar actually does something to fix this, I can't reccomend you buy it.

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an edgy, unique and highly colorful RPG from the golden age of gaming. This game oozes character, charm and is an absolute classic by Rockstar Games, the lords of open world games such as GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas. The gameplay is fast, satisfying and the environment of Bullworth Academy and surrounding areas is seamless and very well constructed. The world is a perfect size and travelling on your skateboard or bike feels smooth and enjoyable without feeling like a chore at all. The soundtrack in Bully is simply sensational. I have almost 25 hours in the game and I still hear new tracks that come up in different missions and they capture the mood perfectly. The graphics aren't entirely horrible for a 10 year old game either - it has native 1440p support and there are excellent guides that help you remove the 30fps cap and add nice graphical overhauls like SweetFX. Crashes can happen although I didn't have many. Save when you can! Definitely a must play for any Rockstar enthusiasts or fans of old school open world games such as Psychonauts. One of the most colorful and individual games I've ever played. Play Bully! ",153,18,5,26,7,0,20

												Should not be sold in its current state. Many will claim the fixes to get this running on newer operating systems are trivial, but there are numerous, they're not guaranteed, and no one should be forced to go through them. Many will claim ""it works fine for me"" which is the most unhelpful statement in all of PC gaming when it comes to the numerous different configurations. But the fact of the matter is, possible fixes include:1. Running the game in Compatibility mode for Win XP SP32. Running as Admin3. Limiting CPU Affinity to cores 0 and 14. Limiting your system's usable ram to 2GBAnd the list goes on with all kinds of remedies to get this working. Grand Theft Auto 4 was patched very recently as of posting this review, it is not impossible. Until then, for all intents and purposes, this game should be taken off this platform.

												Bully aka Canis Canem Edit,I First played it in 2006 when I was 8 and I still play it till this day. It's one of my favourite games of all time.A lot of people call this a GTA type game without as much violence and I would sort of agree to some extent.You cannot steal cars or shoot guns, weapons vary, you can use for example a slingshot or firecrackers, my favourite is the spud gun. Travelling is not bad nor good, you can get around on either your Vespa Scooter, Skateboard or bikes.going to classes in this game is actually fun, my favorite is music and shop, in shop for example you work on bikes and if you get the bike fixed you get to keep it so instead of buying bikes you can unlock them.The community for this game is great, people still make mods for this game which is fun for doing playthroughs.One of my favorite things about this game is the background music/score. Rockstar Games did a really good job and it fits the game perfectly. Story in this game is interesting, the opening cutscene explains why Jimmy is at this school so I won't spoil anything or say anything else. Tl;dr,,1 of my fav games of all time, sfw gta type gameplay. good story and music/background score.This game for it's normal price or even better on a discount is worth it. pray for bully 2.

												One of my favorite classic games from Rockstar and on the PS2. It's like Grand Theft Auto, but you play as a teenage kid in a small open world town of Bullworth. It has a much more toned down violence compare to the GTA series, just from fist fights to sling-shots, and etc. Graphics are dated but gameplay is very fun. Not only that but the game also contains many great and memorable soundtracks.			",283,67,5,26,24,3,12

												Ok. Bully. Where do I start with this game... particulary the Scholarship Edition.Well for starters, Bully (also known as Canis Canem Edit) was first released in October 17th 2006. Damn, the game is almost 10 years old... anyway, it was released on that date and at the time, only for the Playstation 2. It was published by Rockstar Games and developed by Rockstar Games Vancouver. 2 years later, an updated version of this game was released, in March 4th 2008, with the title ""Bully: Scholarship Edition"". It was an updated re-release that pretty much corrected a few bugs in the game and added new content and characters.I'll start with the story, here. The game puts you in the shoes of a 15 year-old boy named Jimmy Hopkins, who has been expelled from a lot of other schools in the United States for many reasons. We're talking about stuff like foul language, disrespecting staff, violence, etc. And as a result, Jimmy's mother and his new stepfather (whom we never really learn much about in the game) drop him at Bullworth Academy, while they go away on their honeymoon. Now, Bullworth Academy is probably the toughest school in the US, as it is full of bullies. And not just the students. Being aware of this, Jimmy prepares himself for the worst as soon as he sets foot inside the academy's grounds. From that point, you start meeting the rest of the game's character who... honestly are pretty good characters. Whether they're relevant to the story or not, you can interact with everybody. From fellow students to prefects to teachers. How you approach every single character is entirely up to you. The first three story relevant characters Jimmy meets are two fellow students named Petey and Gary, which are like... the opposite of each other. Petey's a bit of a shy kid while Gary's pretty much a sociopathic bully who wants to take over the school. The third character, who is like the very first you meet is Dr. Crabblesnitch, who is the principal at Bullworth.Like I said before, the academy's full of bullies and the students aren't the only bullies in there. So expect crap from everyone. Even from the nerds.Now, onto the gameplay. It's nothing different from almost every other sandbox game. Although Bully has its own unique features. But it's pretty much a huge world to explore both inside and eventually outside school grounds. Like I said, Jimmy can interact with pretty much every other NPC in the game. How do you approach people is entirely up to you. You can either try to be nice or be straight up nasty and show people who's boss.Since this is pretty much GTA inside a school, you obviously have classes to attend to. 4 of them are part of the Scolarship Edition. There's English, Chemistry, Biology, Music, Art, Photography, Math, Shop, Geography and Gym. And some of these classes are worth attending to, for some good upgrades. I don't recommend them all, unless you're trying to go for 100% completion.You also have lots of different collectibles spread throughout the academy and Bullworth Town, which once again you can try getting for 100% completion. I believe some of these collectibles reward you with stuff, too.The game is also long as there are plenty of missions and side activities to do. I did a mix of both story missions and a few side activities, which caused me to have like 29 hours put into the game. But you can probably register a lot more if you complete every single side activity, attend to every single class and pass and look for every single collectible.Last but not least, the graphics. Safe to say they did improve with the Scholarship edition, compared to the original release, back on the PS2. I personally think they look good enough for a 2008 re-release. That's all I can really say. Unfortunately I can't play the game with everything maxed out. And I'll soon explain why.Despite Bully being a great game, the PC port has a few flaws, which can make it a little unstable. First of all, I don't think it's possible for the game to run at 60 FPS in any computer. I've seen it on my computer and on a friend's. Both decent PCs. Second, the game constantly crashes on you, making you lose progress if you haven't saved in a while or if you're in the middle of a mission or a side activity. Third, I strongly recommend playing the game with a controller, if you have one at your disposal. The game... works well with mouse and keyboard, but the controls feel a little weird. So if you can, use a controller.Now while I may have mentioned a lot of pros about this game, the few cons I pointed out make it difficult for me to recommend this game for the PC. Since the game runs a lot more smoothly on the Xbox 360 and probably on the Wii, too. It's also available on PS3 and PS4, but it's Bully, not Bully: Scholarship Edition. So if you can, get it on console. If you're not able to, go with the PC version and do your best to be patient with the game.And with all of that pointed out, I say it's time for the final score. I personally give Bully: Scholarship Edition a 7/10. It's a great game with a great story, great characters, plenty of stuff for you to do and a big world for you to get lost in. But it doesn't get a higher score due to its problems on PC. If it wasn't for that, I would gladly give this game an 8 or a 9.So with that, I say go look for Bully. Hell's it's right here on Steam and it's not too expensive of a game! So go look for it, buy it and enjoy it. And don't let yourself be fooled by the title. While the game's title may sound like it's a bullying simulator, it's totally the opposite!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bully came out back in 2008, and yet I have more fun with this game than I do with a lot of games that came out around this time. This game in it's purest form is Grand Theft Auto but with children. Guns are now slingshots. Stealing cars is now stealing bikes. Hookers are now giving girls flowers to get kisses. I love this game, i'll give it a 7/10.			",315,38,3,37,24,5,23

												ok, this is becoming a huge problem. Of course it works fine on windows 7, but we NEED windows 10 support. I am honstly surprised I made it past the entire game. Too bad I had to save every 10 seconds so I wouldn't lose my data. Bully is an amazing game, which is why I bought it, but rockstar needs to improve their PC ports and steam needs to pay attention to old games and their problems. A simple update to fix this issue would be just fine. I want to play this constantly, and I do, but I hate havoing to re open steam, click on Bully, wait for it to load only to be greeted by the re occuring ""Bully.exe has stoped working"" It sucks even more when you get past a hard mission or class and almost make it to the save location and the constant error pops up, stopping you in your tracks. I've gotten very far, and I don't want to restart, so please for the love of the community add windows 10 support.-love, everyone with a windows 10 computer.			",72,3,2,3,6,0,2

												A timeless classic. The game world is not as big as most GTAs, but believe me, EVERYWHERE there is something interesting to do; long after you end the game and reached 100% completion, there are still tons of funny mini-games to do - besides the usual free roaming, which unlike GTA actually gets better when your wanted level arises. Go buy it, now.			",24,14,0,5,4,1,17

												First of all we should give credit to Rockstar to make such a classic instead of bashing on it for not having features of recent games. I'll be talking about them but in the end I didn't mind them.This is a console port, and also at least 8 years old, so you should except crashes some odd bugs and glitches and the fact that a controller suits this game the best but it is possible to do with k&m only do not set the punching button to your mouse because it can get stuck into punching. A glitch I had while playing was while fighting the nerds and someone was holding firecrackers and he threw it next to me and we both spazzed as if we got electrocuted and both 'died'. This was one of the funniest glitches I had in a while.The AI in this game is pretty entertaining and shows how AI have evolved in the last 8 years. You notice random falling and puking when playing and also when you interact with some of them they tend to run away. Just like in real life! The girls are also fun to mess with but if you mess too much they'll stand in between your fights making you get busted most of the time.The story is pretty interesting, you are a nobody and you are forced to make an empire out of the school to stop bullying and then in the last chapter it all shatters and you have to show them again who's boss. They really portrayed most of their antagonists as douches who search for power which seemed a little repetitive to me. The map is used to it's fullest which I enjoyed, although transport wasn't always as convenient. In some missions I really had to pray to RNG Jezus because some really relied on RNG to succeed. I absolutely didn't like the asylum missions, they were so annoying to complete, glad that one of them is a side mission. It showed that the checkpoints sometimes were very off, in the side mission once caught it was mission over back to the school for the mission, and the other one dragged you out of the asylum once caught which made little sense to me.The game has a lot of side features which were worked out very well. You could follow classes, mandatory but who cares, and they gave you items or bonusses once completed correctly. You can collect rubber bands, smash gnomes or graves , or collect cards. And there are certainly a lot of combinations of clothing to try on once unlocked.The game had a wide variety of music and even different battle music depending on which faction you were facing. The music itself is actually pretty decent although no singing it's mainly good instrumental. The game also relies on stereotypes for their humor which they also pulled off pretty smoothly.All in all a good classic of Rockstar with a decently long story and worth the play for the price it asks. But keep in mind every 4 months or so it holds a 75% off sale on april, august and december.			",34,6,0,9,8,0,6

												I'm not recommending this on PC, I'm recommending this on one of the consoles, just be aware that it's bugged on all systems, but it suffers most on PC.Canis Canem Edit, Or Bully is a good game. It is Rockstar's most unappreciated game. It is brilliantly paced, has excellent writing, has surprisingly solid gameplay mechanics, looks decent for its age and has great characters and voice acting. It's splashed with Rockstar Games humour, and is more than mini-GTA.However, the PC version is a poor port. The PC controls are a mess, so you need a a game controller to have effective control in all situations. It's also locked at 30 FPS by default, although there is a crack that removes the frame limiter, but to use this, you need another method of keeping the frame rate below 60FPS, or else it will run too fast.And after all of that effort, if you have a new system, during some instances of running the game, it will stutter, and nothing can stop the stuttering other than restarting until you get lucky. My old system got had zero stutter after Patch 1.2, and the 60FPS fan patch, but my new, more powerful system almost always stutters, I have to restart and restart until it decides to not stutter. It can run with no stutter, but it's a matter of luck.Because of this, I recommend buying it on console, specifically XBOX 360 or Wii for the additional content that is also on the PC version. This game is worth playing, but the efforts to optimise the game on PC are terrible.This is a modern classic, but the awful porting drags the entire package.			",253,34,9,26,36,1,38

Anyway i digress this game in my opinion is pretty much GTA for kids just toned down and also has the most creative and arttactive plot, people who like running around in a sandbox world in a school enviroment.. then this is for you also i recommened this to GTA FANS just be aware this is nothing like gta but contains most elements..EXAMPLES: GTA has guns, Bully has the spudgun,potato launcher and slingshot.....GTA has wanted levels, Bully has a trouble meter so go ahead and purchase this if you'd like also prepare for a few game crashes here and there so save like a MOFO XD.........Bye!

From the moment I saw it on consoles, till I played it on 2008 on PC, I got in love with this game. I've even bought it on steam, even though I've already played it in the past. Rockstar Games, this game got a lot of fans and it would be very sad not to see a sequel of it. Please, make us happy soon. Just inform us that you will be soon starting to make its sequel. Please, we would all become very happy. I will even try to be the first one to buy the sequel. You can even make a prequel of it. Anyway, thank you for this great game.			",373,144,15,33,42,8,47

												Although very simple and easy for today's standards, this game still holds up as a fun pastime. The story of a rebellious 15 year-old in a hostile school/city had several hilarious moments; the cutscenes introducing the missions are wonderful in their debauchery, as usual with these Rockstar open world games. Of course, it's more innocent and less violent than the GTAs, which was a nice change. I didn't strive for doing every optional quest, so I finished the game after a little more than 15 hours, completing almost 68% of the content; but there's a lot more to do if you want to explore the whole map or engage in the several minigames.

												Let me get the negative out of the way first. The controls are very clunky and counterintuitive at times, which is sorta to be expected from a Rockstar game ported to PC. Expect to tap the Alt key quite a bit to run. The game might get a little buggy at times, like getting stuck getting on bikes or in cutscenes. For some reason there's a 30 FPS cap, but there's a modded version of the .EXE that raises it to a nice smooth 60 FPS. But some missions get bugged in the 60 FPS version, which is annoying. That's the bad stuff.Now the GOOD stuff: Pretty much everything else. The in-game universe is very lively; no two students or people look exactly alike (even though you may see them repeat inexplicably), and they all have different personalities and voice actors. You get everything you'd expect out of a game that lets you play as a bully at school: wedgies, Chinese burns, stuffing peope in lockers, swirlies, ""Kick Me"" signs, stink bombs, you name it. There's a decently sized open town to explore outside the school as you progress, and a nice selection of weapons to unlock as you go. Once you get the hang of the controls, the combat is fun and satisfying. But I think the best thing about this game is all the awesome music you'll hear. The game even comes with the soundtrack. A good game overall, priced reasonably well, and definitely worth checking out.			",86,17,2,0,12,2,0

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Basically, this game takes Rockstar's GTA open world sandbox style of gameplay and applies it to a high school setting. It doesn't quite have the length or scope as a Grand Theft Auto game but I think what it offers fits the style of game.The porting job is really bad. And at times it almost makes it unplayable. The controls are very awkward to use. It's hard to target someone when you're trying to fight them. The mouse becomes way too responsive when you try to move the camera during certain activities like riding a bike. And the mini games in class are often cumbersome when using a keyboard. If you think you can't get over these problems then this game is probably not for you. But if you are a slightly more patient and forgiving gamer, then when you stick with this game it might actually surprise you how fun it can be.Overall: this game actually pretty fun and entertaining.

												**In this review I won't be putting preformance issues when playing on Windows 10 into consideration****Huge fanboy review**Whenever someone asks me what my favorite video game is I point to Bully. My dad randomly bought me the original on the PS2 as a surprise birthday gift when I turned 8. I didn't think much of it and played it with the kids that showed up to my birthday party. The original Bully on the PS2 was not much different, but the Scholarship Edition available on PC and Xbox360 make the game even better than the original. To start off, Bully has the best soundtrack I have ever heard, it fits so well with the cliques in the school, the classes you attend, the school itself, the overall ambience and aesthetic of the game. The story may seem a bit corny but it is a T rated Rockstar game. Pretty much every chapter in the game is designated to one clique whether it be Bullies, Jocks, Greasers, Nerds, Preps, Dropouts, and finally non clique (which don't really get their own chapter). You have an in game time in which you have to attend classes, sleep, shop, etc. The classes also help you progress through the game unlocking special abilities and weapons for attending. These include Chemistry, English, Art, Gym, Biology, Music, Shop, Photography, Geography, Math. With each having you attend 5 times until you finish the class. All these things I mentioned make the game just so mezmerizing to me. I can't explain how much love I have for the style this game gives. Simple things  in this game just make me go insane, like the Carnival's freak show, the unique textures, the way how a light buzzes as you are running to your dorm way past your curfew, the police sirens that can be heard in the distance as you are roaming the school doing tasks for other students, I almost feel insane on how much subtle things I get so aroused by. Honestly I can keep going on about the things that just make this game so ♥♥♥♥ing perfect but I'm getting tired and its 3:21 AM.  I give Bully a 10/10, Ten years of my life have passed since I got it when I was 8 and it still stands as my favorite game ever made.			",82,9,4,12,7,0,11

												Bully is just like the GTA series, just without the blood, drugs and guns. You start as a brat named James (Jimmy), he starts at a new school and quickly get dragged into alot stupid stuff and soon finds out he has some enemies and starts his epic journey to fight bullies with bully. You get to bully the crap out of people, beat them up senseless and throw marbles at grown ups, what else can you ask for? The story is your typical college/high school story, with a large dose of classic Rockstar humor. 7.5/10 Great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game. Like, the fact that I had the will to finish this game 8 times (On 3 diffrent platforms) just shows how much I'm more or less addicted to this game. As most Rockstar games, has great humor. A good story. A great open world and very innovational game mechanics. The first Rockstar game to have seasons in it..Well 2 or 3 diffrent ones anyway. I garuntee you get this game as soon as you can! This one gets a 9.4/10. It can't be perfect if it has some minor and odd looking glitches, let alone the fact that this is a remake of a game made in 2006. But it's still good!			",136,9,1,5,8,3,5

												A little janky nowadays, but with the best story pieces from everyone's favorite/least favorite high school days, Bully clocks in as a fun and charming ""baby's first GTA"". It outstays its welcome a little by the end, but not by much. It runs smoothly and I had no issues at all while completing it. Recommended.			",550,160,25,59,40,1,76

												I remember playing this game 7 years ago...I remember helping Dr. Watts with his products, I remember breaking the windows of Mr. Hattrick, I remember dumping Mr. Burton off the cliff while he was inside the public♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I remember having fun.Your objective in this game it's like almost every single Rockstar game, rise and shine above all of the rest. You begin with nothing, and you climb by helping factions, getting girl panties, doing your homework, and eliminating those who tries to ♥♥♥♥ you on the way.Some classes are boring or complicated while others are somewhat rewarding. You fix bikes, you disect animals, you take photos, you old-style wrestle, you do drugs chemical stuff, etc.The controls are a ♥♥♥♥ing mess and it's mandatory to rebind them. Other than that, this game is good.			",414,109,15,30,28,9,40

												I'll give you a quick break down. Dated Graphics, repetitive missions and funky camera controls. Those are really the only negatives about the game. I think the game is great. The missions could be a bit more diverse, but you can't get what you want always. Go play a demo or something. The game is really worth €9.99. If you're on the fence, get off. Try the demo if you're really worried, but how can you go wrong with a rockstar game at that cost?			",355,118,6,31,33,2,23

												The 30 hours I played this, was fantastic. Im impressed with the graphics, impressed with the fighting, impressed with the story. And as a GTA player, I like to return to this and just relax, not stealing cars, killing everyone, etc etc, I like to just play Bully because of its originality. and recently I heard there coming out with a bully 2! I'll keep my hopes at a minumum, because, usually if it takes them this long to do it, they are gonna be in the GTA V mood, and add in alot more. Like maybe hes in his late 20's now annd he startes stealing cars and all that crap. But, not many games are based in school anymore. Alot are now just TURN SHOOT RUN DOWN A HALL SHOOT LOOK LEFT SHOOT TURN RIGHT SHOOT, WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND GET A 5 KILL STREAK! WE WIN! Thats why I like bully.			",245,29,2,16,16,1,12

												You play the part of a school kid who isnt willing to learn, after being sent to a school you hate, you meet up with a few friends and try to take over and move up the ranks.The game is played out in the style of GTA without all the cool stuff, graphics are not brilliant but it is an old game, good for its time.You may get really bored at the start of everything as it takes a little time to get interesting, the place opens up as you progress through the game and you get to explore a whole lot more, this is when it gets fun, theres so many silly mission you gotta do and tasks to make you laugh, aswel as the classes you have to attend meanwhile, and as you run around the school and streets you can cause alot of trouble, which is the part everyone loves.The basic story is you gotta try and be king of the school, the biggest badest bully, but theres someone who stands in your way, so you gotta slowly make your way to the top by completing alot of tasks to lead you there, its all pretty easy and theres plenty of hours to keep you occupied (around 15hrs for the main storyline).Overall not a bad game really, lots of fun once you get into it, maybe best buying at a discount price just to make sure you feel you got your moneys worth, as this might not grow on everyone, worth a shot tho.

Overview:Bully is a not so famous game from Rockstars repertoir, where you take the role of a teenager Jimmy Hopkins as he is transfered against his will at Bullworth Academy, after being abandoned by his mother as she goes in her honeymoon with her new husband. Labeled by many as ""GTA, but in High School"", and I can see why that happened. You could make connections between the two concepts, such as street gands being replaced by student factions, and you being free to cause as much mischief as you want, stealing cars becomes stealing bikes and so on. While this is an old game and unfortunately a not that well polished console port, it certainly has that Rockstar imprint on it and it is a worthwhile experience.The Pros: Open World - The game features a small, but spacious town full of things to do, customizations to get, items to collect and so much more. All this while respecting the school schedule or suffering the concequences. You are also free to cause problems, fix them, just have fun or romancing with the ladies. Character Development and Great NPCs - I always expected from Rockstar this kind of character progression and NPCs. You start out as a social outcast, who hates everybody and eventually build your way up the social ladder and become everyones favorite. About the NPC's some would say they are quite bland and exagerated, though I think that was exactly what the developers aimed at. There are several major groups: The Bullies, the Nerds, the Greasers and the Preppss. All of them so evidently and heavily stereotyped, it is meant to make fun of them, and I would say it is the perfect combination between cringing and laughing. Realism - While the games graphical capabilities aren't someting to behold, as its an old game and *ahem* a console port, the game makes up for it in the details. You fail school if you don't get to classes, you get punished if caught outside past curfew or not wearing the school uniform to class, almost every action you do will raise or lower other factions respect towards you, and many more details.The Cons: Console Port - While I'm not trying to bash or blame consoles here, because this is just a mere port, navigating through the menus is done only via the keyboard, some binding being rather... unintuitive. Sometimes the loading screens will cause the game to crash while rendering at 1080p. Compatibility Issues - Usually this shouldn't be a concern. I managed to play this game rather well without (many) crashes in Windows 8.1 x64, but sometimes the game can be unresponsive on launching and many small bugs that Rockstar never adressed. It's not that bad that you can't deal with it or fix it yourself, but I would have expected more from this game.Conclusion:Is the game optimised? No. Can it get a tad repetitive? Yes. But is it fun? Hell yes. I recommend this game for any nostalgic Rockstar fan, and for everyone that wants to reimagine their highschool shenanigains as a unfortunate, almost abandoned, family-issues having teenage boy.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												This is mostly the most funniest game I've ever played. No game has made me laugh in tears.Throwing a Firecracker has never been so fun.9.7/10Review:I've never played the PS2 version in my life, so this is my very first time playing Bully. When I found out about it, people said it's like GTA. Now I have to say: I really dislike GTA myself. But looking at the screenshots for the game, I was like, this doesn't look like GTA at all. I played it for an hour, and I was really into it, and when I threw a FireCracker at someone and got busted, I laugh so hard I couldn't breath and was in tears (No joke.)This game has a very good plot. It takes place with a kid named ""Jimmy Hopkins"" who got a new stepdad, and is going to BullWorth Academy for being expelled by all of the schools he has been too. BullWorth has loads of bully, and it's Jimmy's job to stop the bullies by beating them up, doing some tasks, etc. The characters are well though out, some annoying, some likable, and some dislikable. You might like Jimmy the best.Gameplay is a bit of a key masher, and using Shift as attack is just unconformable, even running around is just awkward, and aiming is a huge pain with a mouse considering how slow the sanity is. So having Controller Support is great. The Gameplay adds more things to use in combat, which is nice so that it doesn't get repetitive. Game has Missions as well, and every single Mission is different. You can even learn new moves from Gym or the Hobo Guy. Mini-games are great as well, and though out.Graphics are kind of Meh, but hey, it's an old game. Bugs do happen though, and some of the Physics on character can sometimes be weird, even in Cutscenes  (Example: Some guy's leg twitching, characters go through some things, etc.) The soundtrack is great, it really puts you into the mood like when getting chased by a teacher/police-men, in fights, etc. Interacting with other people in the town gives the town life, so that it doesn't feel empty, and it's open world, so that's awesome too. If you get accomplish anything, it's very rewarding, and if you get busted or fail, it feels punishing.This game is great with humor as well, and the game is great by itself, even it's beautiful FPS.Overall:+Gameplay+Story+More weapons when playing the game more+FPS+Mini-games+Great characters+Open World+Humor is great+Controller Support+Awesome Soundtrack, really puts you into the mood.+/- Graphics are Meh-Poor, Awkward controls with M/Keyboard-Weird Physics that happens sometimes.-BugsYou should get this game. If you have the money, get it.9.7/10EDIT I:I realized that the music doesn't loop in mini-games. That really sucks that it doesn't loop, because they are catchy. I even relized that I can raise the sanity when using the mouse in the options. That's better to make up the awkward controls for M/Keyboard.EDIT II:I beaten the game. For 15 dollars, it was worth it on how long the game is.EDIT III:It turns out you can play freely when you beat the game. It gives you the Missions you missed, and you can finish the classes you missed. I'm trying to get 100% on this game, and it might take a while.			",45,4,0,4,8,1,2

												Bully is a very good sandbox game. The PC port isn't that great: a controller is highly recommended for playing, but if you have one you shouldn't encounter any serious problems.There is a very good variety in missions, keeping things from becoming stale. The combat is still fun, though not difficult, but the game doesn't lean on it too hard. The developers used their imagination not just for mission objectives, but also for the mechanics you'll use to accomplish them. There is very little one-and-done, with the developers instead first introducing you to concepts to make sure you know how to use them when the missions come along.The school and the surrounding towns are very fun to explore, which is important to a sandbox. Each area has a distinct feel to it, and there are plenty of routes and vehicles to get around on. Customizing Jimmy's outfit is executed well, with a good selection of sensible outfits and zany articles of clothing to make an outfit to suit whatever mood you happen to be in. It would be better if you could store more than one custom outfit at a time, and scroll through the articles of clothing more quickly, but the end result is still great.I very much recommend Bully. It's great fun to play, and has a lot of personality to it.			",199,46,1,34,30,3,53

												Bully could have been dubbed: ""The mischievously violent adventures of high school."" condensing the entire spirit of the game. Think of it as a silly Rockstar take on the path to adulthood, taking wrong turns every nook and cranny.This is not a children's game though, as the humour is typically Rockstar-borderline, which is absolutely great.Has some technical issues with windows 10, but still more than worth suffering through.

												One of Rockstar's golden gems that, sadly, has seemed to fall through the cracks. While not as grand in scope as Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption, Bully was certainly as detailed for its time, and the PC version omits none of the finer touches. Although the interface is subpar, it is easily dealt with, and a minor hindrance at best. The combat, so to speak, is somewhat of a middle ground between Rockstar's earlier work, such as Vice City and San Andreas, and its latter work, namely Grand Theft Auto IV; while serviceable, it's not very inventive in its mechanics, per se, but rather with the imaginative weapons it puts at your disposal. Bags of marbles and stink bombs are more memorable than, say, an assault rifle and a shotgun, if purely for the novelty of their use. To a large extent, that philosophy explains the charm of this game. While not rare for any media to take a satirical look on American schooling, Rockstar pulls it off in such a way that the plot, although unsurprising, is laced with charm. It's unique to watch a frankly idiotic protagonist emerge as a flawed hero through less-than-cliche means, and mostly for his own benefit, instead of some altruistic need to help his schoolmates. As always, the writing is truly where Rockstar shines. I wish this game had gotten a sequel, but, as we pass the ten year anniversary of its release, that looks less and less likely. As such, Bully will have to stand on its own as a memorable critique of the farce that is the American education system.			",118,11,0,22,6,0,18

												Bully is one of my Top 5 games of all time. It's got the classic Rockstar storytelling quality, and the gameplay is just as fun as the best GTA games.Bully though is special to me because of the school theme...it reminds me a lot of being in High School in the late '90s. I can relate a lot to the main character, Jimmy, because I didn't belong to one particular ""clique""; I had friends and enemies in all of them. I was bullied a lot and in turn, did my fair share of bullying (something I'm definitely not proud of).Bully specifically reminds me of the '90s because it seems to be set somewhere within that decade. Although it was released in 2006, the vibe here is of decades past. There is little to no tech...you don't see characters sporting cell phones and the only tech I can think of is the digital camera you acquire. The classrooms, cars, and overall setting look oldschool like they did in the '80s/'90s and the mischief Jimmy gets into is the same type us '80s/'90s kids got into before the days of smart phones and social media.I love this game so much that I own 3 copies...this one, Bully Scholarship for Xbox 360 (backwards compatible on Xbone), and the original PS2 version (backwards compatible on PS4). Which brings me to my next point...Sure, I love the game, and I'm thrilled to own the various versions but what prompted me to seek out alternate versions is the absolutely unstable way of how Bully Scholarship runs on Windows 10. I've tried every fix out there from different exes, compatibilty modes, processor affinity settings, to limiting the amount of RAM the program uses and Bully still crashes randomly at the worst possible times. I even followed that ""How To Make The Damn Game Work"" guide (which is the best out there) and my game still crashes. So just plan on it being unstable if you're using Windows 10. People tend to have better luck running it on Windows 7 and earlier. My only advice is to follow the steps in the guides in an attempt to minimize the crashes and save often...maybe even restart the game every 30 minutes or so.So those are my thoughts on Bully in a nutshell. I highly recommend the Scholarship Edition since it improves the graphics and adds content, like extra missions and classes. If you have an Xbox (360 or One) or Playstation (PS2 or PS4) it'd be in your best interest to pick up those versions too since they are less prone to crashes (and they are cheap). One final recommendation I have is to download and apply SweetFX with the Bully template of your choice...it really improves the colors and makes them pop. You'll also have some extra graphics options too. Best of luck with this janky port, and HAVE FUN AT BULLWORTH! \m/			",1008,284,48,105,88,11,108

												Crashes often which means you have to end up racing to a save point every time you do a task. There is no autosave.I have only managed to get 30% into this game despite the play time. I'd end up getting fed up redoing the same bits over and over again and uninstall, then come back months later just incase.

												It's rare that a developer goes from make a adult game about crime with very adult themes. To making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example Bully is a giant open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play, and much more to just kind of find.The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions;like the jocks or the nerds, and the more the more you do work for one faction it can effect your standing with others. Which in turn can effect the way some of the people treat you at school. The combat is very similar but instead of machine guns and rocket launches. Your playing with slingshots and stink bombs. There are also a lot of things that are different about Bully that really makes it feel like your in high school it feel very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. Like you have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class, and of you don't go the prefects or any adult of authority. All the classes have there own perks like one of the classes shows you where all the collectibles, and unlike the protagonists in GTA jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep so if your out past 2 you just pass out on the spot which can make some night missions feel a little too time restrictive.The story starts you out in a car ride with you and your mom and what seems to be your new stepdad. They then drop you off in the front of Bullyworth academy where you meet the principle and some of the teacher, but the fun starts to come in when you go to your dorm room and meet your new friend Gary, who is a sociopath, i don't know how else to put it.You soon start to become manipulated by him, and you two soon go your separate ways and you start to see less and less of him. You then start to do work for the other factions of the school. Playing Bully it kind of puts you back and makes you think about your time in high school, I know the archetypes aren't as plain and simple as they are in Bully but it does a great job of boiling a lot of the high school experience down to a 20 hour game.Then there are a few technical issues with bully I didn't really have too many other then the game crash on me a couple of times, and that just sucks after that happened for the first time a started saving much more frequently. I can't really say definitely how the game will turn out for you, but it didn't seem to bad. From my experience with it. Over all the game is well made but parts of it just seem kind of repetitive and broken;overall though I think it's a great game.			",136,22,0,9,3,0,12

												This is a game that I played briefly about 6-7 years ago that I never completed, which is strange because I usually obsessively play the story in Rockstar games to completion. Chances are if you wanted to play this game at some point you have by now. Coming back to this in 2016 was rough graphically and gameplay-wise. However, once you get past the rough edges, this is a game where the sheer lunacy of the tasks you are completing (such as beating up midgets dressed like Christmas elves, helping a drunk santa find his drugs, collecting panties for the peverted gym teacher) still makes this game playable. The story has major holes and meanders throughout, but the characters and setup for missions remain entertaining. The combat and skateboard/bike are fun if at times a little clunky. Last but not least, the soundtrack is pretty incredible (no hyperbole), though you'll hear the main theme over and over again. The only way I  can recommend this game in 2016 is if you somehow missed it in years past and care more about atmosphere and mood of a game than the mechanics itself. This is a really cool little offshoot that Rockstar has done aside from the GTA games. At the price you're likely to get it at nowadays, it's a cheap, laid back time if you missed out on this little piece of Rockstar's history. The obvious downside is the graphical fidelity that really makes you appreciate how good games look nowadays, in addition to audio bugs that take away from the overall presentation. If you don't play it, at least give the soundtrack a listen.			",70,18,0,7,5,2,4

												Bully is an excellent game and the ways to have fun are endless. However, this port does not work well if your OS is Windows 10. On Windows 10, you have to run it using compatibility mode by using the options Windows XP or Vista, which is fine. But even with running with campatibility mode, the game still crashes frequently to the point where you have to save after every mission just to be extra cautious in case if your game crashes. I honestly wish that Rockstar would fix this issue to make it work better for the people who have Windows 10 because a lot of people (like myself) have been having the same problem. I highly doubt the developer is going to make a patch though because this game has been out for years and they are too busy with GTA V. This review is not about the game, but it is about the PC port itself. Once you get past the crashes, Bully is very enjoyable and one of my favorite games. I highly recommend playing the original version on the PS2 or getting the Wii version of the Scholarship Edition. Those two releases run the best, in my opinion and I had very little issues with them.			",108,88,3,21,16,1,1

												Sooo... I am doing a new review for my readers (currently none). Bully is Rockstar Games' GTA in school. But instead of killing people you just knock them out. But combat is a small part in Bully.It's class mini-games are fun and make you use your brain too. And don't try to skip class. The prefects will get you. And being a naughty little Jimmy will get you to do chores.Bully's story is deep and great. It has some crude humor and some small laughs that make this game a gem. Like every Rockstar game.Bully might not have rainbow graphics for 2008 but this is a port of 2006's Rockstar game Bully : Canis Canem Edit. Canes Canem means dog eats dog in latin...I did not focus on the gameplay part of bully but you need to try it out. Violence, dark humor, makin' out with taller chicks and more high-school violence... And this gets a : Badass seal of Badassery. ",126,11,2,13,4,3,1

												Now I finally know it's not easy being 15 years old rebel! Thanks to Rockstar!!!I recommend it to everyone who likes open world games, can play in third person perspective and who would like to try something new. Bully brings many hours of fun as you go through main story missions and some optional side missions. You can attend lessons at Bullworth Academy to unlock some extra items or skills.I really like how they made intro videos before start of story missions.They are very interesting to watch and if you fail some missions you are able to skip intros. I like how the story involves several groups of students - Bullies, Nerds, Preppies, Greasers and Jocks.In Bully it matters in which period of the day are you doing your missions. It will be necessary not to be seen by authorities at times you should attend your lessons or at the nighttime. Don't forget to be in bed latest at 2 or.. I won't tell you what ;) No spoilers!Later on you can explore different areas, play mini games, bike race, swim, fight, have romantic relationships and kiss girls and more!Even though Bully: Scholarship Edition is one of my favourite open world games, I want to point at some cons. The game was impossible to play&enjoy with mouse and keyboard. With controller it's simply perfect! The second thing I don't like is the system of saving player's progression. You are not able to save when you have a mission running and it's possible to save only after finding a save book. The concept wouldn't be that bad, if the game was actually stable and wouldn't crash very often. But in the current state, it can be very disturbing.* * * RECOMMENDED * * * Now it's time to give us a sequel, Rockstar! :)			",252,57,1,14,4,1,0

												Welcome to Bullworth Academy, a melting pot of high school stereotypes. Outsiders are making plans to rule the world, teachers terrorize their pupils, sports aces and rock 'n rollers try to impress the girls while the posh students wrinkle their nose. While the GTA-style game itself is well done, the technical conversion to the PC is a bit sloppy. Should you ever be asked why video games are a cultural asset, show them Bully.

												I really like this game, it helped me express my anger way back in the days. when I was was a kid I was bullied at school by some big dumb doofus heads. I would often come home and play this game to take out my aggression. It felt REALLY good beating up some fat nerds, and even better beating up some dumb jocks, like the ones that beat me up. Although to be fair, they only beat my up because they were jealous of me and my SMOKING hot GF who had big boobies (she weighed 450 pounds, mostly because of boobage) and they would call me stuff like ""Gay"", ""Weak"", ""Pony loving ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" because sometimes I wore my super cool 20% cooler rainbow dash T. The jocks also called me a dumb gay♥♥♥♥♥♥because I would wear super-awesome-supreme-ultimate-ninja shirts like Naruto or some super-cool-awesome-beat-em-up Attack on Titan T shirts. One day I went home, and asked miku what I should do. She said I should challange them to a dance off. Long story short, I won. the dumb jocks cheated and tried to beat me up instead of dancing because of their super inferior dance moves, and their inability to pull off a fedora.Anyway, I'm a lot stronger now because I've been drinking a lot of diet coke (so im also skinnier) because I use to drink a lot of regular coke.Good game, I'd recommend it, especially to all of you enlightened by your own intelligence.

												This game is cool... the story to the game play will keep you busy. If you are willing to deal with a GTA San Andreas engine from the original xbox during game play however, will be a whole different story. The game starts out with you being a delinquent coming from a step-father sort of relationship. You get dropped off at this academy for behavioral correction and your journey starts there.Throughout completing the story, you are able to acquire new sort of weapons or skills (such as dynamite or a strong uppercut). When fighting, the player is able to make fun of that person. I'm not one for violence but when I got swung at by a jock I kept kicking and making fun of him while he was down. When not in combat options to down talk or up talk someone is also available. There are requirements to go to class and perform quick time events. Some classes or learning new knowledge allows the bully player to unlock more. When running around at night time or when engaging in a fight, supervisor teachers are around and will make it a case to chase you down if you cause enough ruckus. The graphics are alright and will keep a veteran gamer happy as one grew up without HD. This may bug some to a point and may lead to a person putting down the game sooner rather than later. I like the game, but since it is bit out dated and having played more than my fair share of GTA's since the first I'll have to rate it is an average :RATING : 7.1/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-EDIT : Upon playing it more, I'm starting to play it simply for the experience (duhhh) but it's turning out to be quite enjoyable. Problem is I'm friends with a bunch of nerds and all the bullies want a piece of me.			",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Bully... where to start?You play the role of Jimmy Hopkins, after getting expelled from numerous schools you get placed on Bullworth Academy. A school full of bullies, nerds and annoying teachers.You go around helping people, going to classes, pulling pranks, bullying people, going to the carnaval and alot more!Bully: Scholarship Edition uses a newer game engine than the original from 2006, it does look like a 2008 game but still has a really good school atmosphere.There are some downsides though, the pc controls are verry clunky and can make it annoying to play at times. The game crashes alot and this can make it really frustrating when you haven't saved after doing a few missions. Altough there are fixes on the internet, they still don't prevent the game from crashing at all. Over all i would highly recommend Bully: Scholarship Edition, if you're a fan of openworld games with wide variety of content. Bully is an amazing interesting, refreshing and creative experience!

												Under normal circumstances, I would not be giving Bully a bad review.Bully is a great game. One of my all time favourites. I sing its praises all the time. I tell everybody who hasn't played it to play it. It's killing me to not recommend it, believe me. This game means a lot to me.BUT....The PC port is awful. It's been eight years since Scholarship Edition was released and the issues are still here. You might not suffer from the god-awful glitches, but your game will crash unexpectedly a lot.I looked up so many different techniques and solutions to avoid getting your game crashed. I've tried them all, and there's always this small sense of panic and dread just waiting for the game to crash at any minute after trying the latest solution, and it never dissapoints in that regard!It's a damn shame. For lots, Steam may be their only way to get to experience the greatness that is Bully, and while it is possible to finish the game's campaign on the constantly-crashing PC port, it will be a long, uphill battle to do so, and it shouldn't be that way. Great game, awful port.			",73,30,0,7,6,0,3

												Kinda like a toned down school boy mini world semi GTA aspect game!Graphics: The graphics are not the best and certainly okay for the game. You might be annoyed at the style of it like I was!Controls: I used an Xbox controller because I originally played the game on Xbox so I automatically knew my way around it when playing Audio: The audio is simple at such with some cool affects added like bullying sounds, marbles and tripping people up etc Game: This is overal a good game.I have played some hours on this game and I like the design of the game.Yes Rockstar cannot make a proper PC game, and this game is no different.  It has the bugs and problems like all Rockstar games, but then you look past them because you are a Bully.You get to do things that you normally do not think about in a game, you kinda get a free roam where you get go karts, bikes etc and ride around the local town terrorising so that part is enjoyable.The way the game goes about the classes feel like a mini game in the game, so the design is good.I would actually like to see an updated version of Bully, like a Bully 2 with some nice graphics would be nice.Would I recommend this game? Yes it only 60% of me.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2014/11/bully-scholarship-edition-gtacko-ze-stredni/Some people I know dislike this game because of the name. But none of them had tried it. It's really great, GREAT game! You could say it's a GTA clon with a kid as the main protagonist, you just have sk8board in stead of a motorcycle and bike in stead of cars, oh and, no murders. Still, nobody asks you to bully anyone, you can choose to do it though, then it's only your fault and not the game's :D 9,5 out of 10! AWESOME!			",90,27,5,17,9,3,6

												One of my all time favorite Rockstar games, which I personally enjoyed much more than the likes of GTA IV and V. I played Bully all the time my PS2 when it came out a decade ago and, wanting to relive that nostalgia, recently picked it up on sale for a few dollars. Unfortunately most of the reviews did not mention how absolutely broken it is for Windows 10. And when I say broken I mean crashing literally every 15 or, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes. And for an older game with no autosave function that means redoing missions, classes, and favors again, and again, and again. I am aware there are many ""fixes"" to the crashing issue, I've spent hours searching for all of them, but not one of them has worked for me. Some report that their game works fine and some of the solutions have solved their crashing problems, but beware that many of the solutions that work for some do not work for others. It's a shame that such an outstanding game was given such an abysmal pc port, but as it is now I can not recommend it.TLDR: One of Rockstar's best games, but one of its worst pc ports that is plagued by random and frequent game crashing.

General info~Genre: Open world, action, school simulator, third person~Number of players: 1~Completion time: 15-35 hours~Adolescent protagonist~Rockstar Vancouver productStrong points+Detention vs Prison: Bully: Scholarship Edition isn't just a GTA (Grand Theft Auto) with younger felons. Rockstar Vancouver created a unique world where attending classes and spending time with your roommates and girlfriends is more important than owning a city or harassing opposing operations. By playing Bully you will have the chance to reminisce stories from your own childhood / school years. Of course, there are strong similarities to other Rockstar titles, but give the game a chance before judging it too harshly.+Narrative: From zero to school's most recognizable figure, our hero will rise to success through a clever script filled with some bold ideas. The game is divided into chapters with different events, weather conditions and rising adversaries.+Characters: A believable protagonist, an elite school, a carnival full of freaks, a drunk homeless Santa, Bullworth has them all. In addition to the town, Bullworth Academy is a bustling community housing different factions: from the dorky nerds and perverted teachers to the strict prefects and snooty cheerleaders. Some of them serve as companions, possible love interests or even chapter bosses!  Many of the characters will affect Jimmy's road to the riches in numerous ways. Feel free to run the rest over with yourscooter.+Rock around the clock: Bully features a time-based world. Different quests or characters may appear depending on the time so stay alert at all times. Just remember to return at your dormitory before 2:00 am lest you fall asleep on the pavement!+I own you: Feel free to expand around town and own different places. These save spots function aptly as bases for sleeping or hiding from the authorities.+I'm out of powder: Unique weaponry that suits Bully's atmosphere. Itching powder with a notorious stun effect, slingshot for taking care of business from afar, even a bottle rocket launcher for throwing... ehh... deadly glass at your enemies!+Know your body: Throughout the game you will have the opportunity of attending classes. They are not mandatory but passing them will grant you useful skills such as secret revelation on map or persuasion of girlfriends in order to... increase your overall vitality by 100% . Feel the power of love, baby.+Watch the trilby, boy: Many clothes to customize Jimmy with. Dress him like an elf, Christopher Columbus or mafia leader. Afterwards, pay a visit to the barber shop for taking care of that big head of yours.+Those yellow spots: Except for classes and random mayhem you will also have to complete quests in order to advance the game. I found the majority of them entertaining, novel and of normal difficulty. In addition to the main challenges, Bully features side quests and secrets scattered around town offering unique prizes: Lawn mowing, protecting nerds harassed by bullies, even cart racing.+Murder on the dance floor: Instead of songs or radio stations, Bully features different instrumental themes fitting for each occasion. Example: 


YouTube™ Video: Bully Scholarship Edition Soundtrack - Nerd Fight Theme 

			Views: 100,475		

			This Is The Soundtrack / OST For Bully Scholarship Edition When the nerds get angry.		

+Length: Neither to long for gamers who get bored easily nor too short for those who cherish free roaming and secret hunting.+Full controller supportWeaknesses-Jimmy is a beast: He possesses unlimited stamina, accuracy prowess and herculean strength. Kidding aside, you can run without having to stop to take a breath. I do not find it as a major weakness but certainly drops the difficulty a bit for some gamers.-”Adrian, I did it!”: You can still finish the game without passing any classes. This takes one of the strongest parts of Bully away, so invest some time on them just to fill more of a student and less of a petty criminal.-You missed a spot: I found out that a few quests are permanently lost if end-chapter missions are finished prior to them. Always make at least two save spots if you are a completionist.-Problematic adaptation: Before publishing this review, I played the original Bully on my PS2 to compare it to this version. Although Scholarship edition is an accurate port, many players complain about the frame rate being locked at 30 frames per second. I finished the game with no mods installed, on Windows 8.1 and I did not experience a single crash. Nevertheless, whether you experience any bugs or you just want to unlock the frame rate, there are mods to aid you.My rating5/5During the Playstation 2 era certain games suffered from weak or limited advertising and weren't known to a broader audience. Glass Rose, Bully, Shadow of memories and Okami  are among them. Bully: Scholarship edition is an entertaining game with a novel plot in a notorious and addicting universe. Feel free to check it out whether you are an open world enthusiast or a casual gamer looking for some fun. ",73,26,0,11,5,0,2

												Bully is an open-world crime game that playfully twists the formula of its Grand Theft Auto cousins. Set in an unforgiving private school, you’re tasked with taking down the school’s feuding social cliques as a bully who fights bullies using any means necessary. Instead of firearms, you’re given the arsenal of a traditional schoolyard prankster (itching powder, stink bombs, slingshot, etc.) and follow a series of diverse missions that have you racing bikes, winning boxing matches, delivering papers, painting graffiti, and even playing rhythm games. This variety extends to a surplus of optional content in the surrounding town. The game favors density over volume, as the relatively small world feels expertly crafted. Most notably, every single student has a unique name, face, and voice, which helps the game succeed at building the “living world” that so many open-world games aspire to. You can watch these students go to class, kiss in the hallway, hang out with their cliques in the evening, and bully each other using the same pranks you pull on them. Bully’s attention to detail and gameplay variety make it a charming and unique open-world game.5/5 – Loved it.			",331,129,5,40,40,3,70

												Bully is a very interesting game by Rockstar. It was clear Rockstar wanted to try something different compared to their uber violent and masochistic GTA/Manhunt franchises. So they created Bully, which is in essance a parody on the mass violence that goes on in their games.In this game you play as a former high school bully, Jimmy Hopkins. Who is a major reference to coming of age protagonists like Holden Caulfield. The plot is actually fairly interesting and has a few nice twists here and there. It molds nicely with the gameplay, which is similar to San Andreas except your weapons are things like slingshots and bottle rockets. The world itself is also unique, as the game goes on seasons change and the world reflects this nicely.Bully is one of my favorite Rockstar games, and it comes highly recommended from me. It is well worth the price of admission.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												The game is pretty funny, I'll give it that. I really liked the rivalry and chemistry between Gary and Jim, though I wish there would be a sequel where Gary returns. The ""weapons"" are highly creative and enjoyable, and you can even go to classes and pass them after doing various tasks and get good grades. There is a main plotline of course, and ""quests"" or missions to do in sub-plots while following along the main plot, but like many a high school kid's dream, the end goal is to become the head honcho and live it up with the popularity, as leader of the cliques.Ah, there's also that. Cliques, cliques everywhere! And very cliche too, however being the badass that Jim is, he (you) gets to eventually control all of them and keep them in line. From spoiled rich preppy boys, greasers and the militant nerd squad (serious) to bullies, cheerleaders and jocks, playing this game for me felt like going back in time and doing some of the things I wanted to do but couldn't. Have to say, boarding school looks more interesting than regular school.Also you can learn various martial arts from a drunken (homeless?) man, which will come in handy later as you fight future ""bosses"".

												I have been playing ""bully"" since it was can cainm edit (dog eats dog in latin). i have been beating over and over the graphics are a little out of date but its a really fun game. Bully was created By Take-Two and Rockstar Vancouver. You play as a boy named Jimmy Hopkins aged 15 your mum is going on her 55th honeymoon and she leaves you at bullworth academy. If you have played GTA it will feel similar.The gameplay feel much like a GTA game but has diffrent aspects to it. The comedy in this game will never get old.

VERY CRASH-FRIENDLY ON WINDOWS 10 8/10 This is a pretty fun game with an interesting story. The game is about Jimmy Hopkins's (a 15 year-old delinquent) year at Bullworth Academy, one of the worst in the country. Jimmy must gain the control of the cliques to become the king of the school, and does so through many ways, though primarily fighting. At the end of each chapter, there is a boss fight with a clique leader. When he defeats the leader, he gains the respect of that clique. Overall the game is very fun and worth a recommend, but it is warned that the game crashes a lot on Windows 10.Pros: Very fun Good story All the characters are unique, with their own fighting styles, appearances, and personalities 6 different cliques Cool weapons Bikes!Cons Very easy The game world is small, even though he transportation is much slower then GTA, the size is not proportional to a GTA game Locked at 30fps (can easily be fixed through here

												I loved Bully before it even came out. Very original concept, by a great developer. The result was exacty what I expected. GTA is great, but it's fun to take that whole same mechanic and place it somewhere unusual. There is just so much variety in this game. So much to discover. Such a huge world. It is frustrating that the school schedule doesn't give you enough time to explore sometimes, but I guess that sort of difficulty is what adds another layer of fun.			",93,66,4,27,35,3,34

												This is a great game (or at least was on ps2) but unfortunetly, crashes alot on windows 10. I've completed this game in about a day. I keeped losing progress whenever it crashes. so im gonna  make a list of what not to do to help prevent the game from crashing. do this at your own risk if you choose not to take my advice.1. do not talk to the lunch lady unless youre doing a mission.2. do not try to save a custom outfit.3. dont exit the math class before it ends.4. (spoiler alert) when you fight russell be prepared to do that  fight over and over again. it also lags alot(then again that could just be my computer its self.)5. dont save in the principles office. always save at the boys dorm.6. be careful using the rubberband ball.I reccomend that if you have a ps2, pick up the hard copy of the game. its really cheap. or if you have windows 7, visa, or 8/8.1. it works fine on those. but it still periodiclyall of the things that make my game crash, could be totaly different on your computer. These are just things i have run into.so my final verdict, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR WINDOWS 10 UNLESS YOU LIKE LOSSING PROGRESS AND CONSTANT GAME CRASHES			",18,0,1,3,5,0,0

If you do, avoid doing my mistake.I buyed it on a sale long long time ago, did not test it after maybe a year and I cant get a refund now.I think its weird Steam dont have a better routine for removing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that does not run at all.I would think it were in their best interests to provide the best possible user experience, but sadly this makes me think its only about the money.I know it is rockstar thats made this game, but as long as a game is possible to buy on Steam, the game should work on new systems. Make rockstar release a patch or tell them you will remove this game. At least give a fair warning when buying this game were you tell buyers it may not work for new systems.			",41,11,1,15,8,1,22

												I played this on the ps2 when it was first released and the 360 a few years ago now and it is without a doubt my favourite childhood game and I'd recommend it to anyone. However, I've spent the best part of an hour trying to get to the main menu without crashing to no avail, trying all fixes I could find to resolve it; with no luck. I think it's disgusting that this game is still available to be purchased despite the fact that many if not most Windows 10 users can't even play the game.Great game, terrible port...Will be refunding. If you aren't on Windows 10 give it a try to see if you can make progress in the game without crashing, but make sure you only test it for less than an hour and a half to refund if need be. I don't want to completely disparage any Windows 10 users from buying this game but you'll almost definitely be in for a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of hassle.			",25,0,1,2,1,1,0

												Great game, poor port. Humor, characters, story, memorable. Lots of things to do.Constant crashing on Windows 10. There are solutions but they don't work for everyone. To me, limiting my CPU to 1 processor does help with the crashing, ranging from 1 to 5 hours per crash. The 30 FPS cap is stupid but luckily you can easily remove this (google Bully uncapper).gg 8/10 would be 11/10 if it stopped crashing every 10 minutes.			",35,5,1,1,3,0,1

												One of the best of Rockstar's line-up with no future of a sequel, unfortunately.The game looks and sounds dated in many areas today. However, cutscene animations are great, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. What hooks me the most is how every student is unique, has their own voice actor/actress, with their own lines and possible role in the story. The writing is exactly on point, as well.

												Open world-action-adventure game. Yeah, you might call it GTA but it is not really. Saint's Row is far more similiar to GTA than this - and that is a good thing. (No, not because of gang violence, over the top stuff)Bully feels so much different and this is what I love about this game. Its story is pretty long and will keep you entertained for a long time. The gameplay is a bit clunky and the graphics look kind of bad (not Sanandreas bad), but they are good enough for everything else it offers. An open world ""sandbox"" and an awesome story with cutscenes. Definetly get it, at least on sale - but only with a gamepad.			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

												This is a pretty good game. Basically GTA in prison school. I will complain about the control scheme though, mouse being wonky and jerky and all that. But it was manageable.I'll give it 7/10. Worth it if you like GTA.			",110,23,0,19,13,0,33

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is a nice game, action packed with different missions and side-errands, which cannot bore you.The only downside is that it's very similar to GTA 4. It's like a GTA 4 skin.If you never played GTA 4 before, you'll love Bully.			",52,0,4,2,6,1,2

												Fun game. The graphics aren't too good, which is understandable for a game released ages ago, but it's still fun nontheless. I've played this game on the PS2 and that's exactly why I bought this game for the PC, nostalgia. This game is pretty much like GTA, but takes place in a school. You get to beat people up, break into lockers, trespass in some areas and beat more people up. Like GTA, there's always the d-head who catches you if you do these things. Instead of the police, there are school guards (at least what I think they are) they're slow, and you can run away from them, if you got caught by them, you're forced to go to class.9/10. I recommend this game. Go buy it, it's worth it!			",28,5,0,0,2,1,0

But I have yet to become a mustached plumber.He-he-he-he! Stop tickling me and i'll show you!These are some of the quotes you hear, when you walk around in this amazing game.

												One of the best of Rockstar's line-up with no future of a sequel, unfortunately.The game looks and sounds dated in many areas today. However, cutscene animations are great, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. What hooks me the most is how every student is unique, has their own voice actor/actress, with their own lines and possible role in the story. The writing is exactly on point, as well.

												Open world-action-adventure game. Yeah, you might call it GTA but it is not really. Saint's Row is far more similiar to GTA than this - and that is a good thing. (No, not because of gang violence, over the top stuff)Bully feels so much different and this is what I love about this game. Its story is pretty long and will keep you entertained for a long time. The gameplay is a bit clunky and the graphics look kind of bad (not Sanandreas bad), but they are good enough for everything else it offers. An open world ""sandbox"" and an awesome story with cutscenes. Definetly get it, at least on sale - but only with a gamepad.			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

												Lots of fun, absolutely love it. It's so nostalgic playing it and it's definitely a game Rockstar should follow up on in terms of a sequel of some sort. Only problem I have is that the game does crash at random points, but it's no big deal because I save frequently. Other than that and the 30 fps frame lock, the game is great in terms of performance.			",26,1,3,0,1,0,0

												A true hidden gem from rockstar. Bully is just like the GTA series, a open world sandbox-style game set in an privat school. But instead of killing people you just knock them out, combat is a small part in Bully. The story is a typical college/high school story, with a large dose of classic Rockstar humor. I can recommend this to everybody who likes rockstar games, definitly worth the buy.			",97,12,9,18,33,2,8

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an awesome game I can say I get nostalgia when I play it.I remember playing Canis Canem Edit (Alternate Title for Bully) on my friend's PS2 and was hooked onto the game.When I saw Scholarship Edition released I was happy as I could play the game again plus with new content like new classes.The story is really interesting and it is very easily to get sidetracked from attending classes as there is quite a bit to do while free roaming around the school campus and nearby town of Bullsworth.The trouble meter is an awesome feature and it shows what rules you are breaking, whether it be truancy, tresspassing or bullying, etc.You can bully others in this game (though that isn't the main focus as it focuses on the other school bullies) but you will be punished for it and will have to face the consequences if caught.Overall great game and sorry for the huge review.I rate Bully an 8/10 due to the fact that because it is an old game it performs poorly on Windows 7 and above with hugh crashes and performance issues on windows 10Don't just assume that because it is a Rockstar Game that it is Grand Theft Auto.

												I love this game, played countless hours on the PS2 when I was younger so seeing it here it was a no brainer to buy it right away. Im enjoying the game no question BUT the technical issues are runining it, its unplayable to be honest. It crashes ever 5-10mins randomly, Ive lost so much progress due to forgeting to save as frequently, but now i cant even do certain missions because I crash while doing them or just after before I can save.. So I cant progress anymore. Tried every trick to stop this happening and nothing works.. Im really disapointed, such a let down.So In short, dont get the game if you have a low tolerance for loosing progress and frustration.			",17,20,0,8,11,0,2

												This is a very good game! My personal favorite game that Rockstar has actually made to be honest.If you love very long single player games, this game is for you. I have been playing this game for 12 hours so far, and have yet to finish it. I am on the 5th (and I believe final) chapter of the game and the quests just keep coming!Bully provides fresh content and it fails to keep you bored. You have tons of quests you can do at any time whether it be taking girls out on dates, egging the boy's dormatory, or keeping your English teacher from being fired by hiding his alchohol stash. On top of that, you can give kids wedgies, shove them into trash cans or lockers, spray paint grafitti all over the place, steal bikes, and so on. There is just so much you can do in this game!Combat is a bit bad in this game though. You might be tasked to protect a nerd from a jock, problem is, you might keep accidentally hitting the nerd because they are in your way or near the jock as you are trying to beat them up and sweep their legs out from under them. And if you are surrounded by enemies, most will just keep tackling you over and over again until you finally just have to bail and run and hope to god you lose them before they take what little health you have left from you. Rockstar defiantly could have made improvements with camera angles and the combat of this game.Overall though, if you like long campaign games and enjoy having so much as your disposal. you should buy Bully. This is a good game and you will not be disappointed!			",55,10,0,8,9,0,0

												I like these GTA style games. The setting is refreshing and new. At the start I did not like the main character, but in the course of the game I grew to like him. The stories are interesting and sometimes funny.The graphics are from a playstation 2 area, so don't expect too much. Some of the mini games are hard, especially if you are not a native english speaker. The PC port is quite bad I needed a lot of googleing to get my controller running and all that. But if you can overlook the dated graphics and get the game running, it is a fun and challenging experience.			",301,126,8,48,25,1,58

But instead of killing people you just knock them out, combat is a small part in Bully. The story is a typical college/high school story, with a large dose of classic Rockstar humor. I can recommend this to everybody who likes rockstar games, definitly worth the buy.			",97,12,9,18,33,2,8

												Man, I cannot believe some of the people who gave this game a bad review. This was one of the best GTA style games I have played. The Graphics and gameplay are just ok but it the game is extremly fun to play. The charecters are really likeable and has one of the funniest story lines I have ever seen. I would defenatly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good game.Graphics: 7Sound: 9Gamplay: 6Fun: 10			",57,7,0,9,5,0,2

Product received for free
												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an awesome game I can say I get nostalgia when I play it.I remember playing Canis Canem Edit (Alternate Title for Bully) on my friend's PS2 and was hooked onto the game.When I saw Scholarship Edition released I was happy as I could play the game again plus with new content like new classes.The story is really interesting and it is very easily to get sidetracked from attending classes as there is quite a bit to do while free roaming around the school campus and nearby town of Bullsworth.The trouble meter is an awesome feature and it shows what rules you are breaking, whether it be truancy, tresspassing or bullying, etc.You can bully others in this game (though that isn't the main focus as it focuses on the other school bullies) but you will be punished for it and will have to face the consequences if caught.Overall great game and sorry for the huge review.I rate Bully an 8/10 due to the fact that because it is an old game it performs poorly on Windows 7 and above with hugh crashes and performance issues on windows 10Don't just assume that because it is a Rockstar Game that it is Grand Theft Auto.

												This game is incredible. Its definitely dated by todays standards but its one of my favorite open world games ever and it still holds up to this day, I play through it once or twice a year because its just a rock solid game from the golden era of Rockstar open world games. Everything from the art and character designs to the music and voice acting is on point, its pretty clear this game was the developers' baby and they put a lot of love into the final product, and it totally needs a sequel like really, really super bad.R* pls			",217,41,4,14,13,2,19

Jimmy is a good kid at heart, despite what the title of the game would lead you to believe. It's all a matter of choice. You could either bully kids, or try to help them out.

												I could just go ahead and say ""You can give wedgies to little kids and you can grope girls 10/10"" like most people do, but this game deserves a lot more than that.This is my favorite game of all times, got it for the ps2 initially and I finished it like 6 times on there. Then I got steam and had to buy it for the pc and I'm so glad I did!It really is a GTA Junior but I like it even more than the original because it's magical! I don't even know how to express myself. The world is so charismatic, the missions are great fun and make sense, the soundtrack is AMAZING and Jimmy is the best sprinter/aimer/sportsman/biker/boxer/student (if you wish to do all the classes), the best main character in general!Story is short but there is much more to it than in that, in fact if you only do the main missions I believe you don't even get 50% completion, so yeah!I recommend this game with all my heart I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Hell! If you enjoy it a quarter as much as I did you'll still have a blast! :)			",262,61,11,10,9,3,13

												Best game Rockstar ever put out...and I think that is saying a lot! A little lighter than their usual titles... this plays as kinda of a Jr version of the more violent games they come out with. While it may be lacking in blood, gore, and strong language, it makes up for it with fun. hilarious characters saying hilarious things. Awesome story line, fantastic game play, not too hard nor to easy. The map is a decent size with plenty of room to roam around. Nice amount of mission with the story, plus plenty of side missions and mini games. The Scholarship Edition even brings more to the table. Check this out, and you won't be sorry... particular with the extremely cheap sale price this week!(Dec. 17th 2013)			",427,151,12,50,27,6,43

												Let me begin by pointing out that I am a REALLY BIGNORMOUS fan of bully. I started with Rome, continued with the Barbarian Invasion, segueyed into bully scholarship edition. Needless to say, I was eagerly anticipating game. I even bought a top of the line Mach V rig with all the bells and whistles and a 78in monitor to take in the beauty of all. My machine has no problem handing the graphics settings on Ultra and can tell you that visually, this game has the potential to stunning (provided your computer is to the task) and you can mods.rockstar released this much anticipated game yes it did. After reading countless posts on various message boards, it very good. This in effect made everyone who bought it an anti bullying guy( lack of better word). seven.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sun is rising, it's a beautiful day.The alarm clock goes ""BEEP BEEP BEEP"" and you trampoline yourself into a vertical spine position called standing.""My goodness, today is the first day of school"" you hastily expel from your innards.That's right Peter, today is the first day of school but not only that my friend. Today is the first day of school at a new school.Your mother and stepfather will soon drop you off with hatred in their hearts at Bullworth Academy.There you will fight your way to the top and have everyone shout your name when you pass them.""Bully: Scholarship Edition"" they will shout repeatedlyIt will be a wonderful journey and it begins now.Bully: Scholarship Edition or more commonly nicknamed ""Jimmy"" is the main character of this video game and he's not afraid of showing it right away. The story is about him. The cutscenes star him. This is quite the problem for me because he shaves his head. This is something I do as well, for that reason I have trouble distinguishing fiction from reality and got into trouble with the police. Luckily we live in an age of mystery and magic, you don't need to play as Jimmy anymore. You can use technology called hacking to hack the video game and change the model you play as. I opted first in playing as one the adults as I thought maybe the lady folk around campus would be into more experienced men but no. No model would change the attitude they had against me, this made me sad. Hacking doesn't work on the people in the real world either.Gameplay is ""Beat the jocks at dodge ball, play pranks on the preppies, save the nerds, kiss the girl and ultimately navigate the social hierarchy in the worst school around. "" and that pretty much catches it all using the umbrella method. Now, I've only played it for 55 minutes but what I experienced during that time was wonderful. I hit people, threw books at people, hit on people, talked to people(thumps up edition), talked to people(thumbsdown edition), bought soda and meeting some kind of creature called a prefect you can easily avoid by just jumping all the time.The gameplay mechanics is what you would expect from a Rockstar PC port, somewhat clunky but generally okay. The game also features all kinds of education based mini games like chemistry, english, math, geography etc. All these subjects and their mechanics are highly representative of the American education system. In conclusion, it’s a beautiful sandbox-style game with beautiful characters and beautiful gameplay.3/10			",400,134,21,42,38,3,72

												Personal Rating: 7/10Ah Bully. This games getting a sequel in 2016 so hopefully people can get hyped for that after they've stopped ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves about Fallout 4. However let's take a look at the first game.Bully is an open world game set in a school. You play as Jimmy Hopkins who is arguabley the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥on earth at the beginning of the game. Much like Rockstar's other games, you do quests located around the map to advance the story. Very GTA IV like but without any of those silly cars or mass genocides, carried out by helicopters and bowling.Gameplay wise, it's honestly nothing special to be honest. I can't feel connected to Hopkins because he's a♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I can't feel any sympathy for him or any bullies for that matter. I mean, I'm a nerd, in this game you're basically asking me to steal my own lunch money. But the jokes on him, I make my own lunch and bring it with me *pushes glasses up nose*. But nah, it's not fresh. There's nothing convincing me to do any of these actions apart from to advance the story. One new thing they added into this game is classes. No, not Call of Duty classes. As in, actual learning classes like Art, English and Science. You might be thinking ""Well what's the point in going to classes? I live the thug life"". Well, these classes can eventually give you upgrades and weapons such as stinkbombs, clothing and even a bike (which I never got, apparently my lack of skills in production and art carried over into this game). Each class revolves around a minigame, like in English for example, you have to make as many possible words out of a jumble of letters, or in Art where you have to avoid pencils and stuff to draw a picture? I don't know what they were thinking but it works I suppose.Obviously a big part of the game is combat. But it lacks a certain something. Beat 'em ups and Fighting games have never appealed to me, and Bully is basically a beat 'em up with a couple of minigames slapped on the top, with an unrelatable character and numerous little cracks in this game.However, it's still great. As much as I've complained about this game, it really is a very good game. Graphically wise it might not stand up to today's standards, however they were good for it's time. Some of the characters like the Principal and the Homeless Bloke are well made and I enjoyed the parts of the game they were in. Now obviously I haven't played all of this game, I finished it on my Xbox 360 though so that can sort of give you an idea.The one big problem with the Steam version is that if you try and change the options, such as the size of the screen, the game will crash. Well, it did in my case, so I'm playing the game in a 4:3 window. The game's options are full of bugs that may crash the game, so be careful.			",264,79,11,24,42,3,35

												Bully is a wonderful free-roam, perhaps one of my favourite Rockstar games. The graphics are mediocre by this time, but it's nothing to scoff at either. While the game is buggy and has some issues with AI, it's not usually game-breaking and you'll be too busy beating people up to care.The character depth is great, especially due to the fact that no two characters in Bully are the same, they each have their own personalities and traits, and if you don't think so, just stop to listen to them and maybe you'll see what I mean.The music is suitable and, for the most part, sets the emotion of the scene adequately.Bully is a great game and well worth the price.(P.S. Rockstar, make sequel pls)			",87,13,0,4,6,2,3

												This game doesn't work for Windows 10 64bit, so do not buy it if you are a Windows 10 64bit user. None of the compatibility modes work, the game still frequently crashes.Bully: Scholarship edition SHIPS with the Version 1.200 patch on Steam, so downloading the patch from Rockstar and running the .exe serves only to provide an error message as it is already installed.This is a great game marred by a lack of attention from the developer. If they put it on sale, you'd think they'd make sure it worked. What a damn shame.			",183,11,1,22,5,0,19

												You want to know how much I think this game is good? Go look at my Left 4 Dead 2 mods. Then it will be obvious that I think that this game is one of my most favorite games of all time. It has a very unique story, but, like another review I saw, has a bit outdated graphics and low quality sound. But personally, I think this game deserves a 9/10 rating from my experience. I've played a lot worse, but I've played [slightly] better. Therefore, if you're into GTA or Saints Row, then I recommend this game 100%.			",158,31,2,10,12,2,1

Once again I repeat make sure you have some sort of PC game pad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bully is about a boy called Jimmy who has a mum that gets engaged with alot of differnt men and this time she got lucky. She found a guy and got married to him and left poor old Jimmy in a school that is full of bullys and differnt kinds of gangs. You, Jimmy need to rise up to a challange of becoming popular and getting friends while you have to stay out of trouble. Great game			",73,6,0,5,6,1,4

												If you ever see this game on sale, pick it up and play it. Your gonna want to have a Gamepad handy to really enjoy it though. This game will always have a special place in my heart. I'm not sure what it is, but I take a strange comfort in the setting, the people, the places. It plays like Grand Theft Auto but with a High School Setting, you go to classes, sneak around at night, save the school, and get the girl. Has a great sense of humor and a likeable main character. Looking forward to the sequel!			",201,41,3,34,32,0,37

NOTICE: Although I am recommending it, I do advise you should try to play one of the Console Versions or at least use a controler for the PC Port.Bully: Scholarship Edition is a lovely game, just ported poorly for PC.I just finished the game, and only experienced 1 crash and 2 FPS drops through all of it. 1 crash was due to using the camera to take pictures of students for the yearbook; Had a FPS drop during the fight under the school and the other in the factory to fight one of the ""bosses"".I didn't find the controls to be horrendous, they are a bit funny at first, but you'll get use to it after a short time.Story (This subject will lack because the games description will give you a good insight and I don't want to spoil anything) I found the story to be pleasent. It wasn't the best and I found the it to be something like GTA's The Lost and Damned, but not entirely. All in all, I enjoyed it and found it hard at points to stop playing because of it.Gameplay/Controls Gameplay is pretty solid, but using keyboard and mouse can be quite infuriating at at times. Fighting was pain for me at the begining, sometimes I would end up hurting friendly NPC's, because they were in the way of an enemy NPC and using your mouse is how you switch between targets which would cause me to accidently switch to a friendly NPC.Riding your skateboard and bike with WASD can cause you to wreck... quite a bit. It becomes stressful when you are doing a race or an objective that requires you to use your bike.There are 'minigames' so to speak; you can take a side job missions to earn extra cash, go to the carnival, take a trip to a skate park and compete in bike races.Their are collectables such as rubber bands and G&G Cards to snag.I would add tag spots, but they didn't seem perminant but I could be wrong.You also have classes and they are used to give your character upgrades. Example, you complete a Class One Art and you'll get 25% Health Bonus when you kiss a girl. You are not forced to go to class, but the school guards and police officers will chase and attempt to take you to class.Pros:Good StoryLikable CharactersEnjoyable GameplayDifferent From Most Games (That I've played)Cons:Bad PortClucnky ControlsFeels Slightly DatedSummaryI know most people don't recommend it do to it being a bad port, but it is still fully playable.$15 price is not bad at all, I got 20 hours out of it and possibly more if I decide to 100%.I would say, try to get it when there is a Rock Star Publisher Sale going on, then you can probably get it for around $5 - $10.All in all, well rounded game and sadly it doesn't seem to get the recognition that it deserves. One of Rock Stars hidden gems.			",167,14,4,22,12,6,3

												Bully (aka Canis Canem Edit) is certainly one of those rare gems most people have not heard much of. It seems as if the people of Rockstar had been given complete freedom to include whatever they wanted in this game. The characters are funny, the story is compelling, the mini-games are well implemented and the gameplay is fun. I like how although the map is not huge, you’ll see it change as the seasons change. This expands the possible themes of the game and its pace, and it also gives you a reason to change the protagonist’s clothes to fit the current season and do different things at different events during the game (Christmas, Halloween, Carnival time etc.) There are a ton of Easter eggs and funny scenes within the game if you are willing to find them. I liked every single class (but for English, that cr*p was hard) and the missions were all fun, but somewhat easy. The game is old, and you can tell by its graphics and the overall look, but it is still fun and it'll make you laugh at several points. The worst thing you can say about this game is that it’s not a great pc port. There are weird sounds all around (unless you change some setting in the menu), the FPS are capped at 30 and it’ll take you some time to find out how to skip cutscenes. The camera won’t stay in a fix position as it does in GTA, but there are some things this game does better than its older brother Grand Theft Auto. For instance, you don’t have to start all over again if you fail a mission, and at least people use umbrellas when it’s raining. Oh, and collectables do not float in the air and they are included in the game in such a way in which you don’t really have to look for them if you don’t want to, because you’ll get most as you play the game’s missions. Jimmy is a sort of Holden Caulfield, and that’s great. He may a bit aggressive and not be very smart, but that does not mean he’s malicious either. You really have fun being Jimmy and experiencing once again your time at your high school, even if it was probably not as exciting as in this game. Gary, Pete, all the teachers, the different school gangs, the ost, the minigames, going skateboarding everywhere… they may be all simple things, but they really make this story outstanding and, above everything else, fun.

												I've loved this game ever since it originally came out on PS2. I remember one time I invited a few other people that never played it before to play it and they loved it too! The story is amazing, the graphics are beautiful but not hard on a CPU, and gameplay is, good, I say that because some of the controls are bad and well, sometimes things work in weird ways that seem glitchy compared to certain things in Grand Theft Auto III, which came out a while before this. But either way, here are my ratings for the game:Game itself: 9/10Concept: 10/10 just for originality,Story: 10/10, some offensive stuff but that's one reason it's awesome,Controls (for PC): 4/10, aim mode is Up Arrow and to look around you use the mouse, and to move you use the WASD keys, when do you have time in like a boss battle or something to press Up?Physics (among other things): 5/10, you drop an item, it falls straight down. You jump off something with the Skateboard Bucky gives you early on in the game, you lose a lot of speed and sometimes just comepletely stop. Worst of all when you throw someone onto a street curb in such a way, and this is often, they will have gravity to that spot, meaning, they will be able to stand at a full 45 degree angle and not have to balance or anything.Overall: 8/10, this would have to be my favorite game on PS2 besides Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and that underrated game called Gun.Thanks for reading this long review!

												it may seem like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port of a game made for kids who wanted to play grand theft auto. but its story and gameplay easily put those claims to rest. also this is an amazing port with widescreen support, and xbox controller support as well.			",250,19,11,21,8,2,16

												Fun Grand Theft Auto like game.  You play a child with an attitude in a stereotypical school full of Jocks, Preps, Nerds, and Greasers.  Complete missions like egging the school, bike races against the greasers, and run around in the amusement park.			",525,129,7,81,45,5,77

												Good old game!I remember when i owned it on PS2 under the name of ''Canis Canem Edit'', some sort of censorship to the actual name'Bully''.I really enjoyed this game, graphics are nice, the quests and sidequest are fun.There are so many hilarious things you can do, like punching kids, bullies, teachers, girls, old people, police, breaking into girls room at night, start fights against each other, etc. The mini-games are also fun.As for optimization on PC i heard this game had many problems which are now fixed with the last updateSo far i had no problems with this game, It works perfectly fine.I'm still looking forward to see a sequel of this someday made on Euphoria engine.My Rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bully is from the creators of the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. This time, instead of a space age, or an urban enviroment, a school. Bully takes place in Bullsworth Acadamy, and is about a young boy, who has been dropped off at this boarding school because of his wreckless behaviour in the past.Along the way you'll meet crazy characters such as a hobo that teaches you kung-fu, nerds, jocks, and of course, the headmaster.It is and open world game, but the world isn't as big as Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas. However, the world has personality in the character dialouge, and the charm in the enviroments, like graphiti, the carnival and the school corridors. Lessons are fun mini-games, and detentions also have their own mini-games, like lawn mowing or snow shoveling.This game deserves a sequel, and with recent news of Bully getting trademarked, we may have a glimmer of hope for Bully 2.That or it's a moblie port.Rating: 9.5/10			",70,17,2,12,22,1,9

												WARNING: VERY BAD CONTROL SCHEME!  There is partial controller support, meaning it supports controllers but has a lot of problems with them.  Xbox 360 controllers are not plug-and-play, but they work as long as you enable them within the in-game options menu.  The game's default keyboard controls are terrible, and while the game is best played with a controller, it sometimes requires you to use a more accurate aiming tool, like a mouse or tablet, to play the minigames... well, you could probably do the minigames with your joysticks, but it would be unnecessarily difficult.  The minigames are clearly designed for a mouse.That aside, Bully is a nice game for how old it is.  It has decent visuals (nothing special), similar to GTA3 with characters closer to the style of Fable (sort of, see screenshots), and it plays fairly well.  The story has a lot of hilarious moments and some good laughs for people who like absurd phrases.  There are some gross-out moments, as well, so the game may not be for the squeamish.  Immature, snot-nosed brats should love it, though!  ;DThe only gripe I have besides the controls is that the AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The characters will just stand around doing the same behavior, even saying the same phrase, non-stop for the entire time you're near them.  I wish the devs would have given NPCs more believable behavior patterns.  That said, if you run through the levels very fast, you will not notice that issue.You can play a bunch of metagames which help progress the story, but there is not much replay value, because the game really isn't that open and offers very few distractions to keep you occupied.  There is very little challenge to the game, but that may be a good thing for some players.Overall, my opinion allows the game a 3/5.  Get it if it's cheap.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												This game is the high point of Rockstar's early days. GTA:SA and Bully where the best for their time, and with this remastered PC version, I can relive those days. Although the PC Controls are extremely strange. Like, almost enough to make you not want to play, you can change them to make them more user friendly :D			",170,23,5,19,14,3,14

												Pros:Another excellent Rockstar sandbox game, worth the price. Give this a go if you like GTA. I also recommend it for those who like GTA games but often find the story missions too difficult. Bully's missions are a lot easier than those found in most GTA games. There's a lot to do outside of the main story too, with countless side-missions, minigames, secrets and unlockables to find. The game's soundtrack is awesome, by the way, composed by Shawn Lee. If you play this game for more than ten minutes the music will have already been stuck in your head.Cons:If you're playing this on Windows 10 you may encounter crashes a fair few times, there are steps that can be taken to minimise the frequency of these crashes. I took these steps but I couldn't eradicate the crashes completely, I may have missed something however. Also, the game is locked at 30 FPS if you're worried about that. It can be brought up to 60 FPS with some tinkering if you like, I didn't mind it all that much. Another issue I had was the audio, outside of cutscenes I thought the characters' voices were too quiet and they were overpowered by the music, even though I had the speech option at max.To sum up, Bully is a unique, funny game with a great story, a fantastic soundtrack, a ton of side missions, a lot of pranks to pull and a lot of characters to interact with. The few technical problems I mentioned are outweighed by this game's qualities.			",18,4,0,2,1,0,0

												Definitely one of Rockstar's more focused efforts in their long line of open games, Bully still succeeds in staying true to the formula with a somewhat, just a bit though, focused narrative and time constraints imposed on the player by the very nature of the game - attending school. Characters and story are memorable and clearly intended as exaggeration of high-school stereotypes, although many come as 1-shots for some reason. One can't help but praise out-of-nowhere dramatic final confrontation which ends up being EXTREMELY satisfying and just, though. Only really negative side I can think of is the fact that this isn't such a great port.			",907,390,16,194,90,8,172

												Bully was a game back in 2006 released for the PS2 that basically offered the gameplay of Grand Theft Auto to minors without penalty.Bully is a game where you play as 15 year old Jimmy Hopkins as he attempts to survive his high school days after his mother and step father drop him off due to their honeymoon. While Jimmy attempts to fit in, he does various jobs for each of the cliques at the School to gain their favour. Whether its getting som D&D pages back for the Nerds, beating up the Jocks for the Preps, or roughing up the Preps for the Greasers, Jimmy does pretty much everything possible to just survive.Gameplay wise, this is a text-book R* sandbox game with its own unique touches. You can go to class where you play mini-games to unlock new abilities, start fights with the various cliques of the school, or just be a delinquent and destroy everything.Bully was one of the most unique R* games in it's gameplay feel. Sure it plays pretty close to the Renderware Grand Theft Auto games (GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas), it has its own unique feel with a pretty interesting plot, some great voice acting, and missions and activities that are fun to play. It's 14.99 and the game is pretty long, so you do get your money's worth.			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												If you ever see this game on sale, pick it up and play it. Your gonna want to have a Gamepad handy to really enjoy it though. This game will always have a special place in my heart. I'm not sure what it is, but I take a strange comfort in the setting, the people, the places. It plays like Grand Theft Auto but with a High School Setting, you go to classes, sneak around at night, save the school, and get the girl. Has a great sense of humor and a likeable main character. Looking forward to the sequel!			",201,41,3,34,32,0,37

												Bully was a game back in 2006 released for the PS2 that basically offered the gameplay of Grand Theft Auto to minors without penalty.Bully is a game where you play as 15 year old Jimmy Hopkins as he attempts to survive his high school days after his mother and step father drop him off due to their honeymoon. While Jimmy attempts to fit in, he does various jobs for each of the cliques at the School to gain their favour. Whether its getting som D&D pages back for the Nerds, beating up the Jocks for the Preps, or roughing up the Preps for the Greasers, Jimmy does pretty much everything possible to just survive.Gameplay wise, this is a text-book R* sandbox game with its own unique touches. You can go to class where you play mini-games to unlock new abilities, start fights with the various cliques of the school, or just be a delinquent and destroy everything.Bully was one of the most unique R* games in it's gameplay feel. Sure it plays pretty close to the Renderware Grand Theft Auto games (GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas), it has its own unique feel with a pretty interesting plot, some great voice acting, and missions and activities that are fun to play. It's 14.99 and the game is pretty long, so you do get your money's worth.			",212,20,2,5,4,2,5

												Bully on PS2 was one of my favourite games in the Rockstar catalogue back in the day, and so I was excited to get my hands on the Scholarship Edition which promised to bring the world of Bullworth Academy and its surrounding towns into glorious HD life. And whilst textures and draw distance have been improved, B:SE isn't without its issues. The game is noticeably buggy, more so than the original and especially prevalent with the AI behaviour, particularly as you have a whole school's worth of NPCs running about. The new classes/minigames feel tacked on and are of poor quality, with the bonuses you gain in completing them utterly pointless. And call me vain, but I also dislike main character Jimmy Hopkins' new face; I mean, the kid wasn't exactly going to win any male model prizes back in 2006, but his makeover makes it seem like you're now controlling a middle-school aged Wayne Rooney who, in case you don't know, *definitely* isn't a looker. If you need to, give him a quick Google Image Search, and shield your eyes. One of the appeals of the original was saving up enough pocket money to buy new clothing for Jimmy, constantly dressing him up in just enough school uniform mixed with casual items so as to not get busted by prefects for violating the dress code, and so I don't think this demand for superficial consistency is too much of an ask.Despite these complaints, I'd recommend B:SE for any newcomers who never had the chance to play it before. The game is full of charm and accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack, finding a great balance between Rockstar's GTA formula with just enough new ideas to make it seem like a fresh enough experience for both GTA fans as well as those who've begun to grow tired with that series. However if you've already played Bully before, there isn't enough here to live up to the nostalgia, and I'd recommend investing on the PSN version of the original instead. For all its muddy graphics and atrocious framerate, particularly when the outside-school environments open up, the game was perfectly balanced in its original incarnation, without the out of place classes and, certainly, with a much better designed main character.7/10.

												Definitely one of Rockstar's more focused efforts in their long line of open games, Bully still succeeds in staying true to the formula with a somewhat, just a bit though, focused narrative and time constraints imposed on the player by the very nature of the game - attending school. Characters and story are memorable and clearly intended as exaggeration of high-school stereotypes, although many come as 1-shots for some reason. One can't help but praise out-of-nowhere dramatic final confrontation which ends up being EXTREMELY satisfying and just, though. Only really negative side I can think of is the fact that this isn't such a great port.			",907,390,16,194,90,8,172

												My favourite Rockstar published game.Played through the original on PS2 several times, same with the 360 and on the PC.Completed 100% on all these systems too. Definitely worth a buy.Cons for the PC version:The default controls are dogshit. Tweak them before playing or just use a 360 controller.Also to those who ♥♥♥♥♥ about FPS caps, the game is capped at 30fps by default but can be set to 60fps using a custom .exe that can be easily downloaded.In the end, I would recommend 100%. 10/10 game, quite fun.

												Although this game is years old, its definitely an enjoyable game, filled with action and adventure. Everytime i open Bully and start playing, i get sucked into the game and end up playing for hours! The game takes place at Bullworth Academy, where the new studemt Jimmy Hopkins begins after his mom and step-dad goes on a honey-moon. Jimmy is a boy with an attitude and has a hilarious personality, along with hilarious voice lines. You will play pranks on people, Do missions, go downtown to the city and etc. Awesome game. I reccomend this with all of my heart. Get this.			",33,3,0,1,2,2,0

												From a simpler time in open world games but still holds up really well. If you like GTA you are sure to like this.The story is not what I thought it would be, it's sweeter than you'd suspect based on the title and the controversy of the time (which is laughable considering the games made since then). Jimmy is forced to rule the school because everyone else is a bigger jerk than he is and it turns out he's not so bad after all.It's one of the games I like to play through every once in a while.

												I come back to this game every year or so just to experience it again. I bought it on PC during the last summer sale because I had finished it so many times on xbox, but I sold both my xbox and games a while ago.I don't think I've ever played a game that stands up so well after nearly a decade since initial release.The story, the characters, the atmosphere, that perfect soundtrack, all are as great as the first time I experienced the game. Although I'm insanely hyped for Red Dead 2, a little part of me was sad that the announcement wasn't a sequel to this game.Bully has pretty simple open world gameplay, but the world that makes me come back everytime. There's a sense of nostalgia that just follows you throughout the game, even if you've never played the game before, the school setting has a really charming old school feeling to it.Can't say enough amazing things about this game. I was thinking about what my favourite game of all time was and I just couldn't pick one, but then I remembered that this game is the only one I still play after finishing it so many times already it doesn't lose any of the magic that made it great.I'm also kind of worried about the sequel to this game, because I don't think a game with atmosphere and characters this perfect can be topped, or even matched. That's how great I think it is.I obviously recommend it. I'll recommend it 50 years from now. It's timeless.			",66,10,0,7,1,0,0

												WARNING: VERY BAD CONTROL SCHEME!  There is partial controller support, meaning it supports controllers but has a lot of problems with them.  Xbox 360 controllers are not plug-and-play, but they work as long as you enable them within the in-game options menu.  The game's default keyboard controls are terrible, and while the game is best played with a controller, it sometimes requires you to use a more accurate aiming tool, like a mouse or tablet, to play the minigames... well, you could probably do the minigames with your joysticks, but it would be unnecessarily difficult.  The minigames are clearly designed for a mouse.That aside, Bully is a nice game for how old it is.  It has decent visuals (nothing special), similar to GTA3 with characters closer to the style of Fable (sort of, see screenshots), and it plays fairly well.  The story has a lot of hilarious moments and some good laughs for people who like absurd phrases.  There are some gross-out moments, as well, so the game may not be for the squeamish.  Immature, snot-nosed brats should love it, though!  ;DThe only gripe I have besides the controls is that the AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The characters will just stand around doing the same behavior, even saying the same phrase, non-stop for the entire time you're near them.  I wish the devs would have given NPCs more believable behavior patterns.  That said, if you run through the levels very fast, you will not notice that issue.You can play a bunch of metagames which help progress the story, but there is not much replay value, because the game really isn't that open and offers very few distractions to keep you occupied.  There is very little challenge to the game, but that may be a good thing for some players.Overall, my opinion allows the game a 3/5.  Get it if it's cheap.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												I've loved this game ever since it originally came out on PS2. I remember one time I invited a few other people that never played it before to play it and they loved it too! The story is amazing, the graphics are beautiful but not hard on a CPU, and gameplay is, good, I say that because some of the controls are bad and well, sometimes things work in weird ways that seem glitchy compared to certain things in Grand Theft Auto III, which came out a while before this. But either way, here are my ratings for the game:Game itself: 9/10Concept: 10/10 just for originality,Story: 10/10, some offensive stuff but that's one reason it's awesome,Controls (for PC): 4/10, aim mode is Up Arrow and to look around you use the mouse, and to move you use the WASD keys, when do you have time in like a boss battle or something to press Up?Physics (among other things): 5/10, you drop an item, it falls straight down. You jump off something with the Skateboard Bucky gives you early on in the game, you lose a lot of speed and sometimes just comepletely stop. Worst of all when you throw someone onto a street curb in such a way, and this is often, they will have gravity to that spot, meaning, they will be able to stand at a full 45 degree angle and not have to balance or anything.Overall: 8/10, this would have to be my favorite game on PS2 besides Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and that underrated game called Gun.Thanks for reading this long review!

												Bully. It's GTA, but without blood and deadly weapons, and instead of playing as an adult man, you play as Jimmy Hopkins. A 15 year old kid who's aggressive and a fighter, but not truly malicious. He only gives people what they have coming to them.Bully takes place in Bullworth, a town in New England. Your mom, well, Jimmy's mom, drops you off at Bullworth Academy. A boarding school. The school is full of bullies and corrupt teachers and it's up to you to put a stop to it.The game's storyline will guide you through six chapters (There are 65 missions, the sixth chapter is an endless free-roam chapter, giving you the chance to complete non-storyline missions and to collect collectables.) Each of them takes place in a different weather season. The missions vary, it's never the same. One time you're cleaning a rat infested library and the next time you're helping a teacher escape from a psychiatric hospital. As Jimmy, your main goal is to bring peace to the school by helping and befriending the five school cliques: The Nerds, the Jocks, the Bullies and the Preppies.Of course you'll have to go to class. These classes are: English, gym, geography, math (ew), music, shop, art, photography and biology. They are simple mini-games which become noticeably harder every time you attend them and make progress. You'll also have to deal with a time schedule. You can skip class, but you won't get any rewards if you do so and prefects will catch you if they see you outside of class. Jimmy, your character, is highly customizable. You can buy clothes, change your hairstyle and more. You can even buy a bike, a go-kart or a scooter if you saved up enough cash. Money can be earned by either taking a paper route, doing missions for townies or students or by completing storyline missions. You've got weapons. No, they are not guns and no you can't kill people. There's a super slingshot, you can use firecrackers, stink bombs, eggs, a bag of marbles, a bottle rocket launcher and so much more. You can also pick up one of the many objects around you (umbrella's, vases, bottles) and use them as a weapon.Interacting with your fellow students is fun too. You can talk to them, give them presents, put them in trash bins, punch them in the face (aka bully them) and even kiss them. (This only applies to several girls and yes, you can kiss some guys too if you're into that.)The game has a very impressive map size. You can explore the entire school, the school grounds, the town, a fully functional theme park, an industrial park and a few more awesome places. There are many collectables scattered around the map too.Bully may be pretty good, but it's not perfect. The graphics are rather outdated, the sound isn't that amazing and you will have to deal with odd controls and some bugs. But don't worry! It doesn't kill the fun. Bully is an amazing game and there's much to do. And for only $14.99 - £9.99 - €9.99, it's certainly worth it. Go buy it! I recommend you it!			",46,0,3,3,6,0,2

												The first 2 chapters were the best in my opinion 3rd and 4th was alright and i feel like the ending was a bit rushed. Amazing soundtrack Which was produced by Shawn Lee. The audio of the npc's voices were at times not the best. I find this game to be really enjoyable and it gives nostalgia to the people that have either watched the game back in 2006 or played it. I would recommend you to purchase this game and try it out.			",68,5,1,1,4,3,2

												Another great game by rockstar. There is actually alot of content in this game, though there are a fair share of bugs, too. Look beyond that and see that there are many missions to complete, Loads of collectables, and as the seasons change ingame, you get seasonal missions to complete. You can just do sweet♥♥♥♥♥ollies over everything on your skateboard, or just flat out beat up people. Oh, you can also kiss girls and earn health bonuses. I recommend this game.			",74,12,0,10,7,2,0

												Absolutely fantastic game. 2nd favorite Rockstar game, only behind Red Dead. (BTW, LORD GABEN BETTER PUT IT ON STEAM.) Bully revolves around the daily academy life of Jimmy Hopkins, a fifteen year old troublemaker and an all-around badass.The game is really cool because it's open world on the campus of Bullworth Academy. Now, this can be great for the 2 kinds of game players that exist. The ones that actually play a storyline and are afraid to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥in a videogame (Me), or someone who doesn't give a damn and just screws around hitting girls and giving prefects the wedgie of their life (Also Me).Pros:+Humor. LOTS of humor+Likeable Hero+Classroom Aspect+Voice acting (GOLD)+Not restricted to just the campus+Nonrepetetive storyline+Intresting story about betrayal and, well, BULLIES!+Antagonist is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ (I like that)+YOU choose the way you play. Lover or Hater kind of thing+Unlockables+Character Customization+Interesting soundtrack+Fun Gameplay+Easy Achievements, sorta, on console+A Pretty lengthy storyline+Crime and punishment system is realistic-ish and is reasonable+Lenient Prefect escape systemCons:-Vague respect system-Graphics are a little painful to look at, but for it's time it's alright-Controls are something special-No AchievementsThe game is very good, and I give it an 89/100. This is also the first game I got all achievements on (LONG weekend).An underrated game that you should buy.Have fun hiding in trashcans, shoving Algie into a locker, beating up Tad, and making out with Mandy (or Eunice... if you're into that).

												What you need to know about Bully: Scholarship Edition+ 15 years-old version of GTA+ A lot of mini-games and sidequests+ Creative weaponries, vehicles, and upgrades attainable through side missions+ A fine thin-line between sheer innocence of a young boy and savage sarcasm judging irresponsible adults doing/telling youths to do irresponsible down to illegal errands+ On its core, an excellent game with interesting concept well executedHowever I can't fully recommend due to tons of compatibility issues due to bad port (especially on newer system)- Game is capped at 30 FPS (there is an exe. ""patch"" for 60 fps out there in the internet, but it leads to more bugs)- Bad engine that can't handle dated graphic. Can't even set shadow on without having the game unplayable- Crashing when tweaking with graphics options (and resolved without doing anything)- Choppy mouse and camera control (badly affects aiming in first-person and bike control)- Relatively short main campaign story+/- As you play as 15 years old, your world is limited as a 15 years old+/- Perhaps is better played with controller rather than Kb&MDespite all the cons, the game is still a great nostalgia trip if happened to play the PS2 version. The Scholarship Edition added a few extra side-missions and classes, which could be good or bad depending on your tastes (I just find them annoying, but meh)			",145,24,1,9,23,0,6

												In Bully you play as Jimmy Hopkins, 15 year old problem teen who right at the begginning of the game is being left at Bullworth Academy boarding school by his mother and new step father who are about to leave for their honeymoon.When Jimmy first arrives at Bullworth he quickly learns he's at the bottom of the foodchain in the school and sets out to literally beat up each Cliques leaders to earn their respect.The game controls and plays very similarly to GTA with some differences.Jimmy is expected by teachers and prefects which act as the ""police"" within the school  grounds to attend classes on weekdays and go to bed on curfew.Nothing stops you from skipping class or staying up late, but if you get caught it can mean detention.Each class has its own minigame which gets harder each time you pass, and in the post-game you unlock some new classes you couldn't do at the start of the year.Combat is very similar to that of GTAIV, but heavily improved upon. There are many moves and techniques Jimmy can learn such as sweeping under someones legs to knock them over or uppercuts.When using a grapple on another student Jimmy is able to ""bully"" them in various ways.Overall I'd say this is one of Rockstars best releases to date, and one of the few games released by them that I still fully enjoy.If you enjoy GTA you're pretty much guaranteed to enjoy this.

												Bully is a game like no other. It is an open world game by Rockstar, the Publisher that has the best open-world free roaming games in the market. The unique aspect of Bully is the context in which it develops its story. A school for kids who'd rather be in trouble than in class. With a real psycho villain that is on par with the rest of the villains in other Rockstar's open world games. 10/10Buy it, play it and don't regret it.Rockstar, we want Bully 2 after RDR 2!

												was running from a prefect and he got stuck in a wall420/360 would get stuck againEDIT: Holy nutballs I based a review off a rare glitch? Damn must have I been high, erm.Bully:Scholarship Edition is a third person game that takes place in a VERY stereotypical american high-school, if you're looking to do a Columbine this isn't for you unless you want to substitute with a slingshot or spud gun.In one mission you break into the girls dorm and steal panties.The game is full of fun minigames, hell some of the classes are minigames in themselves. (I don't count Maths and English as minigames, ok.)You can basically do whatever you want in a school-themed game and not have any real life consequences, go ahead and shoot that fat nerd with the spud gun.You've got the Nerds, the Preppies, the Greasers and i'm pretty sure everyone would know there would be Jocks in this kind of game, each with their own theme whenever you're fighting someone a part of their faction, speaking of themes, when you get the game you get the soundtrack too for free, some of the soundtrack (like the theme that plays when a prefect chases you down) sounds like 80s cop music and it's just so memorable it's no surprise that it may get stuck in your head quickly.Let's just get to the most fun parts, you can beat people up of course, you could throw itching powder at people and watch them thoughtlessly scratch themselves, you can throw stinkbombs and firecrackers, shoot a slingshot, bottle rocket launcher (kinda like fireworks), and spud gun, make out with several different girls (Or guys, don't talk about that seriously.).The game offers at least 15 hours of gameplay unless you just speedrun it and have no fun at all outside of the main storyline.Conclusion: 8.5/10, I absolutely wish for a sequel, and a sequel with many more hours of gameplay, Happy nerd hunting, gamers!

												In Bully you play as Jimmy Hopkins, 15 year old problem teen who right at the begginning of the game is being left at Bullworth Academy boarding school by his mother and new step father who are about to leave for their honeymoon.When Jimmy first arrives at Bullworth he quickly learns he's at the bottom of the foodchain in the school and sets out to literally beat up each Cliques leaders to earn their respect.The game controls and plays very similarly to GTA with some differences.Jimmy is expected by teachers and prefects which act as the ""police"" within the school  grounds to attend classes on weekdays and go to bed on curfew.Nothing stops you from skipping class or staying up late, but if you get caught it can mean detention.Each class has its own minigame which gets harder each time you pass, and in the post-game you unlock some new classes you couldn't do at the start of the year.Combat is very similar to that of GTAIV, but heavily improved upon. There are many moves and techniques Jimmy can learn such as sweeping under someones legs to knock them over or uppercuts.When using a grapple on another student Jimmy is able to ""bully"" them in various ways.Overall I'd say this is one of Rockstars best releases to date, and one of the few games released by them that I still fully enjoy.If you enjoy GTA you're pretty much guaranteed to enjoy this.

												Bully: Scholarship Edition may be my favorite game on PC. It's a sandbox game by Rockstar that has missions somewhat like ones you'd have to complete in Grand Theft Auto. In many ways this gaame is like Grant Theft Auto but it's a bit toned down. Another thing is thiss game is a lot more fun, in my opinion. The characters are all great, the game has so many funny lines, you could make a book full of them and the gameplay is extremely fun. This game is worth well over $15 and I suggest you get it. The story will make you keep playing for hours. 9/10			",235,59,2,14,22,4,23

												Absolutely fantastic game. 2nd favorite Rockstar game, only behind Red Dead. (BTW, LORD GABEN BETTER PUT IT ON STEAM.) Bully revolves around the daily academy life of Jimmy Hopkins, a fifteen year old troublemaker and an all-around badass.The game is really cool because it's open world on the campus of Bullworth Academy. Now, this can be great for the 2 kinds of game players that exist. The ones that actually play a storyline and are afraid to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥in a videogame (Me), or someone who doesn't give a damn and just screws around hitting girls and giving prefects the wedgie of their life (Also Me).Pros:+Humor. LOTS of humor+Likeable Hero+Classroom Aspect+Voice acting (GOLD)+Not restricted to just the campus+Nonrepetetive storyline+Intresting story about betrayal and, well, BULLIES!+Antagonist is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ (I like that)+YOU choose the way you play. Lover or Hater kind of thing+Unlockables+Character Customization+Interesting soundtrack+Fun Gameplay+Easy Achievements, sorta, on console+A Pretty lengthy storyline+Crime and punishment system is realistic-ish and is reasonable+Lenient Prefect escape systemCons:-Vague respect system-Graphics are a little painful to look at, but for it's time it's alright-Controls are something special-No AchievementsThe game is very good, and I give it an 89/100. This is also the first game I got all achievements on (LONG weekend).An underrated game that you should buy.Have fun hiding in trashcans, shoving Algie into a locker, beating up Tad, and making out with Mandy (or Eunice... if you're into that).

												9/10Another great game by Rockstar!Short summary: A child/ younger persons GTA. No explicit language only minor ( B word for female dog is the strongest language used). Guns are replaced with school like weapons (eg Slingshot). Bikes and skateboards instead of cars.Has a good story and enjoyable gameplay. I quite like the idea that you are a bully to bullies rather than just a bully at a school. I thought the characters were rich with interesting personalites. The gameplay is very fun and even the school subject quests are entertaining (except for english, I found that one a bit boring). The side quests for NPCs are great fun, though there were times when I really wanted to punch the quest giver (which I eventually did). Even at a school there is a wide range of fun weapons to play with and a reasonable sized open world to explore.Overall I found this game throughrally enjoyable. I loved the story and I thought that the gameplay was excellent. I would reccommend that Rockstar fans should definatly buy it. If you have never played one of their games (GTA series, Red Dead Redemption etc.) I reccommend giving this game a go.			",110,25,1,5,6,2,7

												Bully is a pretty cool game, it is reminiscent to GTA in that you can free roam and openly accept missions from random people, as well as complete the main missions. You play as Jimmy who has been expelled from another school and has arrived at Bullworth Academy, and the principal is determined to change his ways. The game is full of fun, hilarity and mayhem. You help Jimmy make his way through the year of Bullworth by helping the bullies, teaming up with the nerds, kissing some girls and even asssiting some of the teachers, there are a few missions which I found annoying but overall the missions are quite well spread and well thought out, the story is cool, there are seasonal changes around the school like Christmas time (my favourite was Halloween, you'll see why). It's a really cool game and worth the money you end up spending.			",75,6,1,1,2,0,7

There are cut scenes but usually these are only at the beginning, to introduce you to a mission, or at the end. It takes a little bit of time to get into the full swing of the game but its well worth picking up. This title goes on sale  often so if your looking to buy the game wait for a discount.

												9/10Another great game by Rockstar!Short summary: A child/ younger persons GTA. No explicit language only minor ( B word for female dog is the strongest language used). Guns are replaced with school like weapons (eg Slingshot). Bikes and skateboards instead of cars.Has a good story and enjoyable gameplay. I quite like the idea that you are a bully to bullies rather than just a bully at a school. I thought the characters were rich with interesting personalites. The gameplay is very fun and even the school subject quests are entertaining (except for english, I found that one a bit boring). The side quests for NPCs are great fun, though there were times when I really wanted to punch the quest giver (which I eventually did). Even at a school there is a wide range of fun weapons to play with and a reasonable sized open world to explore.Overall I found this game throughrally enjoyable. I loved the story and I thought that the gameplay was excellent. I would reccommend that Rockstar fans should definatly buy it. If you have never played one of their games (GTA series, Red Dead Redemption etc.) I reccommend giving this game a go.			",110,25,1,5,6,2,7

												Bought this game more for nostalgia than anything else due to having the same game under a different name of 'Canis Canem Edit' for the PS2 but it had a horrible glitch nearing the end so i could never actually complete the storyl ine as it always crashed at the same point.The game itself is fun, imagine GTA but as a kid....in a school....with a slingshot and other amusing weapons xD Make your way through the game and choose your alliances well, wanna be friendly with the jocks? go for it,bully everyone and chuck them in a bin! Nerds are for you? go for it, protect them from....being chucked in a bin. Build teen romances and go on a date to the carnival, why not?There's also the fun addition of the classes where you have to do mini games/solve puzzles in order to pass but if that type of gaming isnt for you then just skip class! But beware of those pain in the butt prefects! Oh and the coppers if you go off school grounds! ",175,79,5,25,11,0,17

												What can I say that has already been said? Despite some audio issues (unflattering choice of recording equipment guys) and some superflouous new content (did we REALLY need new T-shirts?), this is the Canis Canem Edit you know and love, given a lick of paint in the engine that brought TES IV to the fray, and free from the restrictions of the PS2 that caused the low-quality audio. A fitting remaster, just a shame that the Shop class is still as broken as ever.			",481,70,11,38,30,1,41

												In this game you play as 15 year old Delinquent Jimmy Hopkins as he goes through life in his new boarding school, bullworth. Bullworth has 4 types of students. The Greasers, leather jacket wearing punks who try to act tough, The Nerds, weak mischievous fools who usually use stink bombs on bullies, The Preps, High life living chaps who only associate with other wealthy students and they also love the sport of boxing, and finally the Jocks, they rule the school and everyone knows it. In this game you can beat up practically anything from guys to girls to rats. You can go into town and visit different shops like the barber shop. You can go on panty raids. You can vandalize walls. You can prank people. You can do every bad thing you could have done in school.			",68,9,1,8,7,1,2

												This is certainly one of the best games Rockstar has ever made. Why? Because it's incredibly unique. You play Jimmy, a (possibly 90's?) schoolkid which was sent to Bullworth, at which he spends most of his time. He's a Bully, but a good guy at heart.The game continuesly opens up and gives you more and more tools to play around with, while the Story is pretty appealing since there's a bunch of change and you won't often see the same mission twice.Though, there is one negative point: The PC Port and KB/M controls are absolutely terrible. If you're going to buy this, make sure you have a controller, otherwise it's not bearable. Don't worry about not being able to aim properly, since you won't shoot too often either way, and when you have to, it isn't hard.			",250,71,17,26,57,5,34

												While this PC port comes with awful controls, you can customize them, or do what I do and use a 360 controller.I'll start this review by saying Bully is one of my favorite games of all time, I had it on the Playstation 2, and I kept my PS2 for 2 years until I discovered this was on steam, where I bought this and donated my PS2. Bully has what I consider a great storyline, plenty of weapons and perks, great AI, good replayablility (I've beaten the story, so I loaded a save file and have just been free roaming this whole time. You can unlock a moped, and eventually a go-kart along with a bunch of different weapons from bags of marbles to potato guns. When you first arrive at the school, you are hated for being the dumb new kid. As the game goes on, you gain respect for doing multiple missions, which is how you are treated. I'd say this game is worth $15 but during sales its gone down to $3 or $7. This is a must have in my opinion, after you complete the first chapter you get to go into the local town and cause mayhem, and with a developer such as rockstar you really can't go wrong.The modding community is not what is could(should) be, I was able to download a mod to put the super spudgun into the game but I've only found a few others (One that added cars, different outfits, etc) OverallI'd give this a 10/10.

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an excellent school-based RPG-like game. You first start off in a school, unable to get out of it in the first chapter. But in the second you are able to roam freely in most of the world. The quests/missions are fun to do and staying out of school can be tricky sometimes. Classes in school give you things such as more accuracy for your slingshot, kissing girls can give you more health and some lessons unlock you new clothing. Overall I'd rate this game as 8.5/10You should try it out.			",182,19,8,26,20,0,17

												Jimmy Hopkins, a young delinquent teen, gets sent to the notoriously bigoted Bullworth Academy by his mother, who's caught up in another fling with an older man. He learns his way around the school and makes friends and enemies (well, pretty much just enemies). Taking down clique after clique, he clashes with Gary, a teenage sociopath, for the title of the ruler of the school.I liked this game! The story was amusing and there were several interesting characters. However, the voice acting was painful and the graphics weren't the best Rockstar could have done. The music was GREAT and there was an intricate web of characters and quests to mess around with if the main story got a bit boring. The fighting was a bit strange at first, with unnatural keyboard positions forcing me to twist my hands around each other, but you get used to it, and by the end of the game you're a champ.Basically GTA for teenagers.

												Great game. If you are using an Windows 10, according to others you MAY experience frequent crashes. I've played this on Windows 7 and 8, and I was actually able to complete the full story without any crashes. It's a heavy game however. If you want max settings PLUS a solid framerate, you're definitely going to need pretty high specs. I'm using GTX 960 and I'm getting 60 FPS on max settings. Mind you there is a released executable which replaces the original one, removing the 30 FPS limit. I'd only recommend getting that if you have 8 or more GB of ram. Other than that, it's a really juicy story, lots of fun, and can easily be modded. 10/10.			",43,6,3,0,7,1,1

												One of rockstars best and sort of a hidden gem. It's open world but it has the qualities of a small map design with a nice flow and realism. Game mechanics are actually fairly challenging yet simple in concept. Wish it was more fleshed out storywise near the end but really I just didn't want the game to stop it's very endearing. Graphics are nothing to write home about but they don't seem dated and fit the theme well. Sound and music is great if a little repetitve with some tracks.			",85,8,1,7,7,2,5

												OK, so here's my take on the crashing thing:THIS GAME CRASHES. A LOT. It crashes roughly on-par with any Bethesda game with mods or memory issues, which is maybe twice every couple of hours. I played a full hour before I even found my first crash.I've seen A LOT of people giving a variety of stories on their own experiences with the crashes. Some saying extreme things, like the game doesn't even run in the first place, or that they can place only about 10 minutes before it crashes. I haven't experienced this.My first experience with the crash was by the mission ""Save Algie"", which is maybe the 4th or 5th mission in the game. I figured, ""Oh, there it is-- the mythical crashes!"" No problem, I thought, I'll just load a save..Oh..Oh... I forgot to save since the beginning of the game.SO BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK-- Be aware that Steam will refund the game if you decide you don't want it within 2 hours of gameplay; I would DEFINITELY recommend this game, crashes and all, if it were less than 10$, so definitely get it if it's on saleThe game itself is amazing; I've played it on every console I've ever owned, I've played it since I was a small child, I can even associate many of the events of my early life to playing the game. I even went back on the day I graduated high school to play the game with my friends. It's an instant classic and is tons of good fun, so this game would be golden if not for it's technical issues.All of this said, I *can* recommend the game with a bit of an asterisk next to it: SAVE OFTEN. Do a mission, and return to the dorms to save. I, myself, can have plenty of fun with this game so long as I remember to save after every event, which is not too hard as there's various places to save in the game. That said, if you do buy the game and find you crash too frequently to return and save your game, then feel free to refund it.TO SUMMARIZE: The game *does* crash, but I think it's a managable issue that makes this game worth it depending on your definition of ""worth it""-- i recommend potential buyers buy the game, see what severity they have of the issues, and decide for themselves if they want a refund.Oh, and of course, this isn't to say that Rockstar or /anyone/ shouldn't patch the game-- Come on. If Steam is gonna pull 15$ in on this game, then they need to make sure it isn't working worse than their FREE games. It's not that dated-- I can play Wolfenstein 3D with minimal issues on Steam but can't make a PS2-era game work. Bull.			",89,15,0,19,12,2,9

												Rockstar games has left this game.Windows 10.. Hate it or love it, it's here to stay. And as such alot of older games have been affected by it's lack of proper backwards compatitibility. Leaving a majority of good games like Bully: Scholarship Edition with a smaller playerbase that it potentially could have. Now granted Bully is a very small game, especially in contrast to larger titles like Grand Theft Auto V, but I think it's very important to not forget that even though the community is small it's still one of the most pleasant ones that me and many others have come across, ""It severly pains me to see this great community slowly but surely wither away."" -SWEGTANontheless Bully: Scholarship Edition will still be one of my favorite games still do this day, and it always will be.

												One of the best games Rockstar have to offer. If you can bear through the bugs'n'glitches, and you have a controller, definitely check it out.  Game consistency here is better than any of GTA games. Bully is full of content and worth the money it costs by far. The atmosphere reminds me of the first Harry Potter games. Basically, as everyone says it's GTA about kids. Too bad the kids aren't able to play it. I only wish i could play it back in 2006 and not now.Aslo music is superb.			",347,48,4,22,11,0,23

Where I looked at where the rat was it had disappeared.                                                    10/10 would ritual again			",95,10,2,9,8,3,2

												Bully: Scholarship Edition is an excellent school-based RPG-like game. You first start off in a school, unable to get out of it in the first chapter. But in the second you are able to roam freely in most of the world. The quests/missions are fun to do and staying out of school can be tricky sometimes. Classes in school give you things such as more accuracy for your slingshot, kissing girls can give you more health and some lessons unlock you new clothing. Overall I'd rate this game as 8.5/10You should try it out.			",182,19,8,26,20,0,17

												In this game you play as 15 year old Delinquent Jimmy Hopkins as he goes through life in his new boarding school, bullworth. Bullworth has 4 types of students. The Greasers, leather jacket wearing punks who try to act tough, The Nerds, weak mischievous fools who usually use stink bombs on bullies, The Preps, High life living chaps who only associate with other wealthy students and they also love the sport of boxing, and finally the Jocks, they rule the school and everyone knows it. In this game you can beat up practically anything from guys to girls to rats. You can go into town and visit different shops like the barber shop. You can go on panty raids. You can vandalize walls. You can prank people. You can do every bad thing you could have done in school.			",68,9,1,8,7,1,2

												Great game. If you are using an Windows 10, according to others you MAY experience frequent crashes. I've played this on Windows 7 and 8, and I was actually able to complete the full story without any crashes. It's a heavy game however. If you want max settings PLUS a solid framerate, you're definitely going to need pretty high specs. I'm using GTX 960 and I'm getting 60 FPS on max settings. Mind you there is a released executable which replaces the original one, removing the 30 FPS limit. I'd only recommend getting that if you have 8 or more GB of ram. Other than that, it's a really juicy story, lots of fun, and can easily be modded. 10/10.			",43,6,3,0,7,1,1

												One of rockstars best and sort of a hidden gem. It's open world but it has the qualities of a small map design with a nice flow and realism. Game mechanics are actually fairly challenging yet simple in concept. Wish it was more fleshed out storywise near the end but really I just didn't want the game to stop it's very endearing. Graphics are nothing to write home about but they don't seem dated and fit the theme well. Sound and music is great if a little repetitve with some tracks.			",85,8,1,7,7,2,5

												OK, so here's my take on the crashing thing:THIS GAME CRASHES. A LOT. It crashes roughly on-par with any Bethesda game with mods or memory issues, which is maybe twice every couple of hours. I played a full hour before I even found my first crash.I've seen A LOT of people giving a variety of stories on their own experiences with the crashes. Some saying extreme things, like the game doesn't even run in the first place, or that they can place only about 10 minutes before it crashes. I haven't experienced this.My first experience with the crash was by the mission ""Save Algie"", which is maybe the 4th or 5th mission in the game. I figured, ""Oh, there it is-- the mythical crashes!"" No problem, I thought, I'll just load a save..Oh..Oh... I forgot to save since the beginning of the game.SO BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK-- Be aware that Steam will refund the game if you decide you don't want it within 2 hours of gameplay; I would DEFINITELY recommend this game, crashes and all, if it were less than 10$, so definitely get it if it's on saleThe game itself is amazing; I've played it on every console I've ever owned, I've played it since I was a small child, I can even associate many of the events of my early life to playing the game. I even went back on the day I graduated high school to play the game with my friends. It's an instant classic and is tons of good fun, so this game would be golden if not for it's technical issues.All of this said, I *can* recommend the game with a bit of an asterisk next to it: SAVE OFTEN. Do a mission, and return to the dorms to save. I, myself, can have plenty of fun with this game so long as I remember to save after every event, which is not too hard as there's various places to save in the game. That said, if you do buy the game and find you crash too frequently to return and save your game, then feel free to refund it.TO SUMMARIZE: The game *does* crash, but I think it's a managable issue that makes this game worth it depending on your definition of ""worth it""-- i recommend potential buyers buy the game, see what severity they have of the issues, and decide for themselves if they want a refund.Oh, and of course, this isn't to say that Rockstar or /anyone/ shouldn't patch the game-- Come on. If Steam is gonna pull 15$ in on this game, then they need to make sure it isn't working worse than their FREE games. It's not that dated-- I can play Wolfenstein 3D with minimal issues on Steam but can't make a PS2-era game work. Bull.			",89,15,0,19,12,2,9

PC, This game is broken for pc, Awful controls (i didn't find a way to change em), so i used a controller.

												I've had tremendous difficulies trying to get this game to run properly. As things currently stand, there really is no option that would yield in excess of 45minutes of gameplay on Win10.  No matter what you do with the compatibility settings, no matter what you do wih CPU core affinity setting - nothing manages to mend the utter mess that this game is on a Win10 platform. I've tried two different hardware configs, quad core i5 with a discrete AMD GPU and a dual core i3 with Intel HD5500 graphics chip. Both suffer from the same kind of crashes occuring in seemingly reliable intervals.My advice would be to definitely wait for a sale ( I bought it for measly $3 ) and also to not be afraid of relying on Steam's refund policy in case you find out that the game runs poorly on your system as well.

You're a 16? year old schoolboy who is sent to a boarding school called ""Bullworth Academy"" by you're parents.The game is fun but the framereate is capped at 30. While playing you can be a bully if you really want to, but you can also be nice to the nerds.Pros:- Free roam- Fun missions- Almost everythingCons:- Combat gets old after a while- 30FPS capGet this game if you can afford it, you will not be sorry.

												It's rare that a developer goes from make a adult game about crime with very adult themes. To making a game about a high school kid who moves to a school for child delinquents and socially challenged kids, but in a lot of ways Bully is like a GTA. For example Bully is a giant open world with stuff to collect, bike races to do, arcade games to play, and much more to just kind of find.The mission structure is very similar to GTA, you do a bunch of work for one of the factions;like the jocks or the nerds, and the more the more you do work for one faction it can effect your standing with others. Which in turn can effect the way some of the people treat you at school. The combat is very similar but instead of machine guns and rocket launches. Your playing with slingshots and stink bombs. There are also a lot of things that are different about Bully that really makes it feel like your in high school it feel very structured, but that's not a bad thing at all. Like you have classes two times a day everyday until you pass the highest level of that class, and of you don't go the prefects or any adult of authority. All the classes have there own perks like one of the classes shows you where all the collectibles, and unlike the protagonists in GTA jimmy is 15 and needs his sleep so if your out past 2 you just pass out on the spot which can make some night missions feel a little too time restrictive.The story starts you out in a car ride with you and your mom and what seems to be your new stepdad. They then drop you off in the front of Bullyworth academy where you meet the principle and some of the teacher, but the fun starts to come in when you go to your dorm room and meet your new friend Gary, who is a sociopath, i don't know how else to put it.You soon start to become manipulated by him, and you two soon go your separate ways and you start to see less and less of him. You then start to do work for the other factions of the school. Playing Bully it kind of puts you back and makes you think about your time in high school, I know the archetypes aren't as plain and simple as they are in Bully but it does a great job of boiling a lot of the high school experience down to a 20 hour game.Then there are a few technical issues with bully I didn't really have too many other then the game crash on me a couple of times, and that just sucks after that happened for the first time a started saving much more frequently. I can't really say definitely how the game will turn out for you, but it didn't seem to bad. From my experience with it. Over all the game is well made but parts of it just seem kind of repetitive and broken;overall though I think it's a great game.			",111,13,7,8,14,0,2

												Bully is as a horribly underated classic from Rockstar and deserves a better port than it got. Even with Windows compatablity settings adjusted it crashes seemingly at random. It has crashed for me in the middle of missions and after restarting the game let me complete them only to crash again on my way to class or to the dorm to save.It's hard to beat for the price so I recomend taking a gamble on it if you game on a older system but keep your distance if you're gaming on a Win10 rig.My setup Win 10 64-bitIntel i7-6700 @ 3.40GHz32 GM RAMGeForce GTX 960 ",28,14,0,14,4,0,3

												Great game, classic Rockstar style, fun and well balanced.BUT... The game is unfinishable due to a bug in the ""Rudy the Red Nosed Santa"" mission which still hasn't been patched and doesn't look like it's going to. so 0/10 for unfinishable game.

												Old, cheap and yet an extremely entertaining game! I wasn't expecting much from it, but the game itself is very intriguing and exciting, indeed. Voice acting is exruciating, in the sense that the audio files themselves are low quality, and this shifts during the game - from good to bad, vice versa. ! BEWARE ! It ships with a .exe that is made to glorify the poor hardware of the Microsoft Xbox 360, alas they've limited the framerates to 30FPS. It is completely unplayable as the mouse-delay is unbearable. So pick up the free .exe made from a user on the Internet that enables x>30 FPS - make a copy of the original .exe as some missions WILL be glitched.Other than that, the story is really fun, voice acting is pretty natural and the overall world is very attractive, esp. during winter. It's a little small and there is a great lack of side mission, in my opinion. The game compensates that lack of side missions with stellar story missions! This game is *fully* worth your money, and so will a sequel be.. I hope. ;)8,2/10			",106,23,8,6,5,0,4

												This game is a classic. I found using the mouse to be too hard and the controls were awkward. I used a wired xbox 360 controller that had to be connected before the game was opened for it to recognize, the controller made a huge difference. Being timed constantly could annoy some, for me it made the game more realistic (if you don't go to bed before 2 am you pass out). The soundtrack was great, so was the dialogue and game play. I had no trouble running this on Windows 7. Bully is not about being a bully, it is more about stopping clicks and bullying at the prep school. This game is a hidden gem and a tonne of fun.

												The story itself is entertaining and the humour in this game is top notch, as you'd expect from Rockstar. The soundtrack to this game is, in my opinion, fantastic and adds to the experience. However, this game would have a significantly higher rating if it wasn't for the quality of the port. The sound quality is not the highest and I found the control scheme, which was designed for a controller, awkward on a keyboard and a mouse. Before you buy this game you should take into account that some people who have bought this game have had problems, which I lucky didn't have. To summarise, the story and the premise of the game is good however the quality of the port is not the best. Despite its flaws I would recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

From edgy publisher Rockstar's Vancouver development team comes this dark comedy set in the most vile and sadistic setting yet in a Rockstar videogame: the schoolyard. As a troublesome schoolboy, you'll laugh and cringe as you stand up to bullies, get picked on by teachers, play pranks on malicious kids, win or lose the girl, and ultimately learn to navigate the obstacles of the fictitious reform school, Bullworth Academy.

												Believe it or not this game is a good learning tool.  It preps you for college. It does this because you have to jumble going to class and doing quests. If only I had owned Bully before I went to college.  This game also teaches you how to get girls in 3 EASY steps. 1). Cat-call them ""ayy bby u want sum♥♥♥♥♥"" 2). Give them a gift like flowers or chocolate 3). Kiss them.  Now I get all da pussi (plural for ♥♥♥♥♥) at college.  The only problem with this game is the name.  It should be called:  BETA FANTASY SIMULATOR 2005.  Thanks to this game I can live out my alpha fantasies!			",83,13,0,5,1,0,1

												Definitely one of my favorite games of all time, I played so many weeks worth of hours on the ps2, doing all the quests, getting all the content, romancing students, and decided to buy it on pc since it's now my main source for games...the sheer amount of things you can do in this game--the storyline and its quests are amazing by itself but in addition there are dozens of side quests to complete and items to acquire. Jimmy's room becomes sort of a trophy case for all your achievements in game and it's rewarding to try to get everything you can. As well as that, exploring the world is very fun and rewarding, especially given that you have limitations such as a curfew, so biking around the city at night leads to cops chasing you for ages.Amazing game, I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

												I remember putting this game into my PS2 way back when thinking it would just be Grand Theft Auto in a school. But boy was I happy that I was wrong. Everything about Bully, whether it be its characters, atmosphere, or even its soundtrack, just gives it way more personality than some Grand Theft Autos. It never feels like a chore to play, with more varied missions that keep it interesting long after you'd usually get bored with a GTA campaign. When I saw it on the Summer Sale, I got without hesitation and started my journey through Bullworth Academy for my 4th time. The only complaint I have with the game is that the towns outside of the school never feel as fleshed out or interesting. But that and minor glitches aside, Bully is a fenominal game. And if you have a controller nearby to use, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a fenominal port.			",31,5,0,3,1,2,0

												Sometimes I have problems switching in-between multiple opponents. Some of the classes may be difficult for you. It's older, but it's still a really good game. It was made by Rockstar so if you like GTA you will probably like this game too. You can get several types of transportation in the game (no cars though.) The missions where you help the hobo by finding him radio transmitters are hillarious. You have a wide variety of weapons( no real guns.) The high school nostalgia is definately worth the price.

												Ok so firstly dont judge a review by its time. ok ok so bully, i played bully before on my ps2 and it was, in my opinion, better than GTAV in a long way. I always like to experience old games like this. Rockstar have a really good job at this game espicially to its age. It is a fast paced game with a lot of options to do all at the same time. But MY FAVOURITE THING IN THIS GAME IS THAT YOU CAN HIT TEACHERS!!!!!!!! Finally i want to say that, if i was you, i would buy it with my eyes closed			",79,11,1,7,1,0,4

												I used to play Canis Canem Edit on my Playstation 2. So there was no way to avoid this game. Basically Bully: Scholarship Edition is a reamke of this game. You have different tasks to while you are in the school and the small town around. These are things like bike races, playing tricks on the other pupils, going to class and tons of other stuff. If you are a fan of open-world games I can highly recommend you to buy and play this game. Watching a few videos on youtube might give you a better view on this game.			",113,8,8,8,5,0,4

												This game is a lot of fun, but I can't recommend purchasing it as long as it has so many crashing issues on Windows 10 systems.  It would be one thing if it were no longer for sale, but it is for sale, and it's expensive enough that it's really not okay to have so many people with the same complaint and the only official fix is to tell Windows it's only allowed to use 2 gigs of RAM.  There are a myriad of suggested fixes in the forums, but none seem to fix my problems entirely.It's too bad, this would be a definite ""buy"" if not for the constant crashing.

												Bully is essentially GTA in a school setting. Great story and pacing, the action is solid too with ""creative"" weapons like fire crackers and other projectiles from chemistry class and the guns from the nerds. I like the fact that you would ""want"" to attend class in order to improve your fighting skills (gym) and weapons (chemistry) and social skills (bonus from kissing girls - art class).Finished the game with 60% completion and still lots to do. Must buy for fans of the GTA series. Auto-buy if on sale (like I did last summer sale)			",109,26,5,24,19,0,10

												     Probably Rockstar's best game. There isn't anything that really needs to be said about this game other than that it's just game, no stupid tutorials, no unnecessary features, it is just done well with just the right amount of stuff. Not only that, it follows a really unique gameplay style (more kid friendly than their edgy Manhunt too) which is pretty fun to play, a nice story that actually shows how bad bullying is and shows Jimmy being rewarded for being a ""good"" character, and a great port to the PC. This doesn't really need to be mentioned, but there isn't any problem with controls, or any bugs, or any problems at all, it does every really well and it feels really nice on PC. If you need me to describe what makes this game so good I will easily describe what makes this game so good (since there is a lot).This game's story is just great. There is so much to it and it is so great. It's all about characterization, but still manages to focus on gameplay and problems in the game world. Each chapter shows you gaining the respect of each clique, while showing you not only what their stereotypical clique is, but what each character there is like, which can be pretty funny, or if not, interesting to listen to. I don't think there is any part where I was really bored, which is great. There are also side missions which typically are teachers asking you to do things for them, and are actually somewhat linear themselves. These missions really give you an idea of what the people are like in this game in the background, and gives you a whole world to immerse yourself in. It really does well with the immersion, especially with just how humorous the world is (it's showing that the whole world is almost literally out to get him, and that not only are the teachers idiots, drunks, or evil, but the kids are essentially stereotypes who aren't interesting, but interesting at the same time, something you have to love about this game). Overall, it's really a great experience that you'd have to see for yourself on why it's so great.The gameplay style is pretty interesting too since you play as a 15 year old in a really bad school and neighborhood. There isn't any killing or weapons, and because of that, it focuses more on melee combat and combos, and special stuff like eggs and stink bombs. Other than the combat, there are still stores and an open world like GTA, just a lot smaller, so you focus more on using the map to your advantage and experiencing the importance of each area. Also, there are fun minigames like the Challenges for save points and the Carnival, which both reward you with cool stuff. If nothing else, it's a pretty worthwhile experience just because it's something new, but it's a lot more than that.Overall, this game is a lot of fun and definitely worth paying even full price for. You'll definitely get your money out of this and more. I really can't describe anything more than that so for the best idea of what this game is about you'll have to play it.			",114,10,0,18,12,1,30

												This is by far my favorite game out of all the ones Rockstar has done. It has the feel of a Rockstar game but the story is amazing. The setting actually makes you feel like you are back at school with all the drama and hijinx it entails. Even after 7 years the game still locks amazing and plays great too.I honestly want Rockstar to make a sequel to this game more then any of their other series. PS you can shoot bottlerockets and throw a rubber band ball of death			",205,27,2,36,9,2,13

												A small town GTA-like game about an increadibly aggressive but at the same time noble boy at the Bullworth Academy. It surely is not a perfect game, but still worth playing in my oppinion, because of its unique scenario and storyline. If you want to try it, pick it up at a sale, it is often available at very low prices.Overall the story was nice, very unrealistic at times, but still nice. It features some very odd humor and a highly stereotypical view at US school environments. The mission design seemed to me to be a lot easier on the player than the GTA 3 and IV series of games (which were frustratingly hard and unforgiving at times). I think of this as a mostly positive thing, but some missions like most of the races just felt a bit too easy. The game has five story chapters including a lot of separate missions and additionally has a bunch of minigames called classes which can be accessed at specific day times or are forced upon you if the school agents catch you while classes are running. Most of these classes were quite OK and revolve around pressing the right buttons when signalled or dragging icons to marked places. One of the classes on the other hand was so hard that I skipped it all along after three retries.The game was first released in 2006 and was ported to PC in 2008, a few months before GTA IV was released. The graphics level more resembles GTA San Andreas than GTA IV and looks quite ugly by 2013 standards. There are also quite a lot of rendering and texture glitches and a 30 frames per second limit in the PC version. The latter can be solved by a modified executable file (check the Steam guides) which works mostly fine but breaks one mission. Even if the PC port was overly hungry for resources (I do not know, but most Rockstar ports are) this didn't affect me much anymore because the game ran very smooth on the highest settings on hardware from 2013.I cannot state much about the keyboard/mouse control scheme, which other commentators stated to be horrific (which would resemble the situation of the GTA 3 and IV series ports) because I played the game with an Xbox 360 wireless controller through the PC adapter. Played with the controller the game's handling didn't feel so bad, but could have been done a bit better at times. The combat, even though there were quite a lot of moves to be acquired throughout the game, most of the times felt quite annoying. The vehicle mechanics like skateboard, bikes and go-carts didn't feel bad at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had no crash issues like others have reported, however the audio is a complete mess and makes the game unplayable. I understand this is an older game, but it should not be sold in it's current condition. It doesn't look like Rockstar is going to patch the game unfortunately.			",118,23,0,15,12,3,10

												Definitely one of my favorite games of all time, I played so many weeks worth of hours on the ps2, doing all the quests, getting all the content, romancing students, and decided to buy it on pc since it's now my main source for games...the sheer amount of things you can do in this game--the storyline and its quests are amazing by itself but in addition there are dozens of side quests to complete and items to acquire. Jimmy's room becomes sort of a trophy case for all your achievements in game and it's rewarding to try to get everything you can. As well as that, exploring the world is very fun and rewarding, especially given that you have limitations such as a curfew, so biking around the city at night leads to cops chasing you for ages.Amazing game, I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

												I remember putting this game into my PS2 way back when thinking it would just be Grand Theft Auto in a school. But boy was I happy that I was wrong. Everything about Bully, whether it be its characters, atmosphere, or even its soundtrack, just gives it way more personality than some Grand Theft Autos. It never feels like a chore to play, with more varied missions that keep it interesting long after you'd usually get bored with a GTA campaign. When I saw it on the Summer Sale, I got without hesitation and started my journey through Bullworth Academy for my 4th time. The only complaint I have with the game is that the towns outside of the school never feel as fleshed out or interesting. But that and minor glitches aside, Bully is a fenominal game. And if you have a controller nearby to use, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a fenominal port.			",31,5,0,3,1,2,0

												Sometimes I have problems switching in-between multiple opponents. Some of the classes may be difficult for you. It's older, but it's still a really good game. It was made by Rockstar so if you like GTA you will probably like this game too. You can get several types of transportation in the game (no cars though.) The missions where you help the hobo by finding him radio transmitters are hillarious. You have a wide variety of weapons( no real guns.) The high school nostalgia is definately worth the price.

												Bully SEPart 1: GameplayBully is a very good game as you go though a lot of missions to do with helping people or getting revenge on people.Also if you are stuck on a mission you can always do errands (aka side quest) to earn money.Part 2: RealisimRealisim in this game is good as if you dont sleep at night you will faint. Also if you dont go to class on time and get spotted by a prefect you will be sent to the princibles office. One of my Favourite things on Bully is if you do to much bad stuff you will have to go though detension, but no not normal detension! Instead you have to mow the lawn in a time trial.Part 3: OverallI know there is not much to this game. But I DO recommend it.			",54,6,0,2,11,2,2

												This game is an absolute masterpiece, and possibly Rockstar's greatest ever creation. It simulates school perfectly, with each and every stereotype being able to be associated with someone from your old school. You never see the same character twice as each one has a name.What can I say? This game is nearly a decade old and still holds up to today's standards. It is incredibly cheap for such a great experience.True, the game does occasionally crash, but it's easy to look past this if you look at how good the game is. Besides, it only seems to crash about a third of the time you launch it. The rest of the time, it runs flawlessly for hours.GO AND GET THIS GAME!			",119,16,1,9,22,5,20

												A good, solid game with a lot of charm. However, just like it's protagonist, it's rough around the edges and lacks what is needed for it to be great. When people say it's kinda like GTA in school enviroment, they're right. It's kinda like GTA. Unlike GTA, you're somewhat limited by the school system and time, because you can only do certain things at certain time, but the time flies by quickly and so does the tempo of this game. You're constantly on the move, doing a lot of smaller missions and try to fit them to your daily routine, which is not a bad thing, but a lot of missions are really primitive, especially compared to GTA. Many of them are creative, so you won't be getting bored, I just wish we perhaps had less and more fleshed out ones. You can of course slow down, doing less every day and just fart around, but it can be frustrating, knowing you have to commit truancy to finish a mission, when you want to go to class so you can get a nice upgrade (passing at least some classes is adviced, others give you crap like different clothes you'll likely never wear out of embarrasement).Bully has a lot going for it, but it has some drawbacks, making it somewhat difficult to recommend to everyone. First off, the obvious - poor PC conversion. You will not have a good time playing this with keyboard and mouse. A gamepad is a must. Second, the controls are sometimes very loose and inprecise, plus the autoaiming system when you fight somebody is downright broken, on multiple occasions it targeted an ally, or target that was much further than the one I actually wanted to attack. Also, I really had an issue with a camera, not only it likes to fly around like crazy, but the default view is almost sitting on the ground, not like in any GTA, where it flies over your shoulder. Here, I found myself constantly battling against it.The game has a decent lenght, but it pales compared to GTA. It's by no means short game, but I couldn't help wishing for more - spending more time with certain characters, longer missions and better main story, which is rather weak to be honest, not that it's bad, there are many great moments, but it's somewhat overshadowed by smaller and isolated encounters with weird inhabitants of Bullworth. You meet a lot of hillarious characters once or twice, and then they just fade away, or maybe you'll bump into them randomly, and that's kinda it. Not that it's dissapointing, once again, I just wish there was more, because this settings has so much potential. The main protagonist is kinda underdeveloped, he doesn't have that much character going for and sometimes does questionable things without questioning them at all, when just few seconds before he was pretty vocal about it.With that out of the way, Bully is worth your time. For a great price, there is every school steteotype imaginable, it's all filled to the top with great humor. Dialogues are fantastic, characters are fantastic (although you spend way less time with those that are really interesting, and there is very little character development, again, probably due to the more arcady nature of the game), the atmosphere is fantastic and despite you being limited to much smaller area than San Andreas for example, it's packed with stuff to do. I've especially liked that weather changes as you go through whole year and so does appearance of everything. I don't think there are many games from school enviroment, but I'm willing to bet there aren't any that have open world and are this funny. It is a miracle that we even got this game, and even though it's flawed and lacking, it puts an evil grin on my face.// Also, outdoor graphics are strangely muddy and blurred, there is some rather unfortunate effect applied there, and it doesn't happen indoors. Because of that, when you first start the game, you'll immediatelly feel like something is wrong, and that perhaps you have a wrong resolution. No, it's the game, either a weird design decision, or another bug.			",325,78,2,53,49,2,53

												Believe it or not this game is a good learning tool.  It preps you for college. It does this because you have to jumble going to class and doing quests. If only I had owned Bully before I went to college.  This game also teaches you how to get girls in 3 EASY steps. 1). Cat-call them ""ayy bby u want sum♥♥♥♥♥"" 2). Give them a gift like flowers or chocolate 3). Kiss them.  Now I get all da pussi (plural for ♥♥♥♥♥) at college.  The only problem with this game is the name.  It should be called:  BETA FANTASY SIMULATOR 2005.  Thanks to this game I can live out my alpha fantasies!			",83,13,0,5,1,0,1

												Definitely one of my favorite games of all time, I played so many weeks worth of hours on the ps2, doing all the quests, getting all the content, romancing students, and decided to buy it on pc since it's now my main source for games...the sheer amount of things you can do in this game--the storyline and its quests are amazing by itself but in addition there are dozens of side quests to complete and items to acquire. Jimmy's room becomes sort of a trophy case for all your achievements in game and it's rewarding to try to get everything you can. As well as that, exploring the world is very fun and rewarding, especially given that you have limitations such as a curfew, so biking around the city at night leads to cops chasing you for ages.Amazing game, I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

												Sometimes I have problems switching in-between multiple opponents. Some of the classes may be difficult for you. It's older, but it's still a really good game. It was made by Rockstar so if you like GTA you will probably like this game too. You can get several types of transportation in the game (no cars though.) The missions where you help the hobo by finding him radio transmitters are hillarious. You have a wide variety of weapons( no real guns.) The high school nostalgia is definately worth the price.

You have different tasks to while you are in the school and the small town around. These are things like bike races, playing tricks on the other pupils, going to class and tons of other stuff. If you are a fan of open-world games I can highly recommend you to buy and play this game. Watching a few videos on youtube might give you a better view on this game.			",113,8,8,8,5,0,4

												While this game is old and the graphics are dated, the story, voice acting, and gameplay are an absolute riot. The characters are colorful and the little quests you have to do are never too easy or too difficult. If it was re-released with a new, HD polish, I can only imagine how it would top the sales charts. The gamepad works fantastically with this game. Absolutely worth a purchase-- especially when it's on sale! Imagine GTA, except way less gritty, violent, and dark. Another major plus of this game is the progtagonist. He's extemely likable and honorable, but not in a goody-two-shoes kind of way. It's easy to connect with him as a character, which is important (given you play AS him). The school itself is the prison of legends, and it's really satisfying to screw it all up by egging your principals house while you monopolize all four factions in the little city.

												I remember putting this game into my PS2 way back when thinking it would just be Grand Theft Auto in a school. But boy was I happy that I was wrong. Everything about Bully, whether it be its characters, atmosphere, or even its soundtrack, just gives it way more personality than some Grand Theft Autos. It never feels like a chore to play, with more varied missions that keep it interesting long after you'd usually get bored with a GTA campaign. When I saw it on the Summer Sale, I got without hesitation and started my journey through Bullworth Academy for my 4th time. The only complaint I have with the game is that the towns outside of the school never feel as fleshed out or interesting. But that and minor glitches aside, Bully is a fenominal game. And if you have a controller nearby to use, Bully: Scholarship Edition is a fenominal port.			",31,5,0,3,1,2,0

												A small town GTA-like game about an increadibly aggressive but at the same time noble boy at the Bullworth Academy. It surely is not a perfect game, but still worth playing in my oppinion, because of its unique scenario and storyline. If you want to try it, pick it up at a sale, it is often available at very low prices.Overall the story was nice, very unrealistic at times, but still nice. It features some very odd humor and a highly stereotypical view at US school environments. The mission design seemed to me to be a lot easier on the player than the GTA 3 and IV series of games (which were frustratingly hard and unforgiving at times). I think of this as a mostly positive thing, but some missions like most of the races just felt a bit too easy. The game has five story chapters including a lot of separate missions and additionally has a bunch of minigames called classes which can be accessed at specific day times or are forced upon you if the school agents catch you while classes are running. Most of these classes were quite OK and revolve around pressing the right buttons when signalled or dragging icons to marked places. One of the classes on the other hand was so hard that I skipped it all along after three retries.The game was first released in 2006 and was ported to PC in 2008, a few months before GTA IV was released. The graphics level more resembles GTA San Andreas than GTA IV and looks quite ugly by 2013 standards. There are also quite a lot of rendering and texture glitches and a 30 frames per second limit in the PC version. The latter can be solved by a modified executable file (check the Steam guides) which works mostly fine but breaks one mission. Even if the PC port was overly hungry for resources (I do not know, but most Rockstar ports are) this didn't affect me much anymore because the game ran very smooth on the highest settings on hardware from 2013.I cannot state much about the keyboard/mouse control scheme, which other commentators stated to be horrific (which would resemble the situation of the GTA 3 and IV series ports) because I played the game with an Xbox 360 wireless controller through the PC adapter. Played with the controller the game's handling didn't feel so bad, but could have been done a bit better at times. The combat, even though there were quite a lot of moves to be acquired throughout the game, most of the times felt quite annoying. The vehicle mechanics like skateboard, bikes and go-carts didn't feel bad at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome to Bullworth Academy, an interesting place to say the least. You play as Jimmy Hopkins, a delinquent child on his last chance in an open world. As your progress through the game, you unlock access to more parts of the world, which contains a vast area to explore. This game is a classic, and is just as fun today as it was 10 years ago.Pros:+Visuals have aged very well for a 10 year old game+The gameplay is smooth, with the encounter of a bug being very rare+Very playable, third time playing this game from start to finish and was still enjoyable+Open world full of quirks to explore+Characters fit to their groups seamlessly, making it seem very close to a real school experience+Wide variety of characters with each dialogue fitting in almost naturally +Each environment is carefully designed and makes the setting seem almost realCons:-Main story is generally short, possibly beatable in one long sitting-Sounds sometimes seem out of place, removing a little from the immersion -Limited to a certain playstyle, most choices are made for youOverall this game is a classic, and I highly reccomend it. Well worth full price.9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bully is essentially GTA in a school setting. Great story and pacing, the action is solid too with ""creative"" weapons like fire crackers and other projectiles from chemistry class and the guns from the nerds. I like the fact that you would ""want"" to attend class in order to improve your fighting skills (gym) and weapons (chemistry) and social skills (bonus from kissing girls - art class).Finished the game with 60% completion and still lots to do. Must buy for fans of the GTA series. Auto-buy if on sale (like I did last summer sale)			",109,26,5,24,19,0,10

												     Probably Rockstar's best game. There isn't anything that really needs to be said about this game other than that it's just game, no stupid tutorials, no unnecessary features, it is just done well with just the right amount of stuff. Not only that, it follows a really unique gameplay style (more kid friendly than their edgy Manhunt too) which is pretty fun to play, a nice story that actually shows how bad bullying is and shows Jimmy being rewarded for being a ""good"" character, and a great port to the PC. This doesn't really need to be mentioned, but there isn't any problem with controls, or any bugs, or any problems at all, it does every really well and it feels really nice on PC. If you need me to describe what makes this game so good I will easily describe what makes this game so good (since there is a lot).This game's story is just great. There is so much to it and it is so great. It's all about characterization, but still manages to focus on gameplay and problems in the game world. Each chapter shows you gaining the respect of each clique, while showing you not only what their stereotypical clique is, but what each character there is like, which can be pretty funny, or if not, interesting to listen to. I don't think there is any part where I was really bored, which is great. There are also side missions which typically are teachers asking you to do things for them, and are actually somewhat linear themselves. These missions really give you an idea of what the people are like in this game in the background, and gives you a whole world to immerse yourself in. It really does well with the immersion, especially with just how humorous the world is (it's showing that the whole world is almost literally out to get him, and that not only are the teachers idiots, drunks, or evil, but the kids are essentially stereotypes who aren't interesting, but interesting at the same time, something you have to love about this game). Overall, it's really a great experience that you'd have to see for yourself on why it's so great.The gameplay style is pretty interesting too since you play as a 15 year old in a really bad school and neighborhood. There isn't any killing or weapons, and because of that, it focuses more on melee combat and combos, and special stuff like eggs and stink bombs. Other than the combat, there are still stores and an open world like GTA, just a lot smaller, so you focus more on using the map to your advantage and experiencing the importance of each area. Also, there are fun minigames like the Challenges for save points and the Carnival, which both reward you with cool stuff. If nothing else, it's a pretty worthwhile experience just because it's something new, but it's a lot more than that.Overall, this game is a lot of fun and definitely worth paying even full price for. You'll definitely get your money out of this and more. I really can't describe anything more than that so for the best idea of what this game is about you'll have to play it.			",114,10,0,18,12,1,30

												Right. Where do i begin? This game is the best. Utterly great. Run it at max settings on a rubbish computer. Without Lag.Now, to the gameplay? Bully is also known as GTA School. You will see why. I have this game on PS2 and PC, and I love the story line, which is far better than the Grand Theft Auto V story line. You are in a school, called Bullworth Academy.The town of course, is called Bullworth. And you gussed it... It's Free Roam Open World :) - The best game type!Just buy the game. Now. I promise you will love it. If you don't I will eat my hat.RATES - 10/10			",35,0,1,2,3,0,1

												Just got 100% completion on Bully: SE, had a great time having a wild goose chase to complete all the little tasks and keeping out of the cops/prefects' reach :POne of the best games I've played. I really like the fact that it was open-world and that I could interact with npc's, also lots of gameplay and an interesting storyline (which was definitely not repetetive) to keep me entertained, and the type of humor the npc's and story had to offer was great. I would honestly play the game from start to finish a second time.Bully can be innapropriate at times, as in cursing and sexual themes, so I can't say I recommend it to everybody.

												The reviews on this page are, for the most part, overwhelmingly positive so I decided to try the game and perhaps my expectations were too high based on what other people had written but I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. I haven't played all that much but I don't care to invest anymore time in the game.Technically the game is alright. I find the controls a little clunky. My main gripe is that nothing about the story or the characters appeals to me at all.			",34,4,0,13,1,0,11

												I am so ecstatic that this game runs properly on my PC; I was incredibly intimidated by all of the Negative reviews claiming it's broken. Perhaps it's because my PC is an outdated laptop...Others have said it, so I'll be brief: From the developer, you already know that it's an open-world sandbox. Instead of a gangster/criminal/cowboy, you play as an outlaw/thug/ne'er-do-well in a preparatory school. The game is truly like The Warriors + GTA: 3/Vice City/SAndreas, in the mechanics; The game is truly unique otherwise.One of the things that impressed me most about Bully is how they were creative in rewarding players for going to class:Do well in English/Art (I forget which) to learn social skills (so much making-out with chicks).Do well in Chemistry to learn how to make Firecrackers and so forth.Do well in Gym to learn more advanced fighting techniques (or find scrap around the school and give it to the hobo that lives on the grounds, to learn ""super-classified"" fighting techniques).Etc., etc..P.S.: No Rockstar Social Club!EDIT: Huhhhhh, yet again, a port from an old♥♥♥♥♥game is ("")shoddy(""). TO BE SURE, with all of these ports - I am soooo glad to have them in my Library! Classics are classic. So any sort of complaining about the quality of the ports; I only do so to warn others (again, though, the majority (if not the enirety) of the Negative reviews are only Negative because ""the game is broke,""). With Bully, the issues are: Sometimes while running, if you try and look around with the Right Stick, it is unresponsive or doesn't work as intended. Also, sometimes the picture tears and cutscenes get bogged down. These problems have not hampered me in any way, though.As for the game itself, I forgot just how unrelenting the Faculty is in combatting Truancy. Far too often, they will interrupt you while on a Mission because, with the way Time works, there is little breathing room. I'm pretty sure that when I played Bully originally, I just buckled down and went to all my Classes before attempting too many Missions. I enjoy this game, thoroughly; The persistent Prefects only add to the immersion.			",1923,764,56,219,192,19,232

												The Nerd Challenge:Day 1 - I check out the Nerd Challenge. I have to beat the ConSumo score of 1,010. Seems pretty easy. I get to 234 lb., and die.Day 2 - Still, nothing too hard. I can beat it. I have lots of money to spend on this game, anyway.Day 3 - Starting to get a little mad here. I've tried at least 20 times now, and gotten as close as 800 lb..Day 4 - Sumo pushed me into a blowfish. Getting a little angry now.Day 7 - I keep trying and trying, but it's those stupid blowfish.Day 12 - Should I beat up the Nerds? Is this even worth it? I've tried over 50 times now...Day 21 - The Nerd Challenge still sits there. It taunts me.Day 35 - All the Nerds are gone. Technically, I can take the place, but Fatty's high score still sits there.Day 48 - The arcade machine is starting to make a grinding noise. I'm sure it's okay.Day 63 - Pretty sure somone robbed the joke shop upstairs. Why? I don't care. I must beat the high score. I must beat the Nerd Challenge.Day 89 - I've ran out of food down here, in the basement of the joke shop. Gone without food for nearly 10 days now. I refuse to go up. I must complete the Nerd Challenge.Day 99 - I think I've been considered missing. Even dead. Still haven't beat the high score.Day 146 - 999 lb. Then a blowfish got me. They must die.Day 234 - People are knocking on the locked door now. I can't let them break my concentration.Day 304 - The arcade machine stopped working completely. I can't open the door. I'm stuck down here. I've been eating rats that come down here. I think I've ran out of rats.Day 4,321 - I got the acrade machine working again. I beat the Nerd Challenge.

												This game surprised me. I enjoyed it very much. To make long story shorts it is like GTA, but action happens @school and nearby (small) city. Graphics are outdated - yes, but there is something going on all the time and I was not bored even for a second. There are lots of cool (non lethal of course) weapons, many ways of transport, tons of clothes which you can use to customize your character.When it comes to story - it is pretty shallow and you know what will happen, but missions and side activities are interesting and are not repetitive.I picked this up during winter sale for like 2 euro and it was totally worth it.

												A small town GTA-like game about an increadibly aggressive but at the same time noble boy at the Bullworth Academy. It surely is not a perfect game, but still worth playing in my oppinion, because of its unique scenario and storyline. If you want to try it, pick it up at a sale, it is often available at very low prices.Overall the story was nice, very unrealistic at times, but still nice. It features some very odd humor and a highly stereotypical view at US school environments. The mission design seemed to me to be a lot easier on the player than the GTA 3 and IV series of games (which were frustratingly hard and unforgiving at times). I think of this as a mostly positive thing, but some missions like most of the races just felt a bit too easy. The game has five story chapters including a lot of separate missions and additionally has a bunch of minigames called classes which can be accessed at specific day times or are forced upon you if the school agents catch you while classes are running. Most of these classes were quite OK and revolve around pressing the right buttons when signalled or dragging icons to marked places. One of the classes on the other hand was so hard that I skipped it all along after three retries.The game was first released in 2006 and was ported to PC in 2008, a few months before GTA IV was released. The graphics level more resembles GTA San Andreas than GTA IV and looks quite ugly by 2013 standards. There are also quite a lot of rendering and texture glitches and a 30 frames per second limit in the PC version. The latter can be solved by a modified executable file (check the Steam guides) which works mostly fine but breaks one mission. Even if the PC port was overly hungry for resources (I do not know, but most Rockstar ports are) this didn't affect me much anymore because the game ran very smooth on the highest settings on hardware from 2013.I cannot state much about the keyboard/mouse control scheme, which other commentators stated to be horrific (which would resemble the situation of the GTA 3 and IV series ports) because I played the game with an Xbox 360 wireless controller through the PC adapter. Played with the controller the game's handling didn't feel so bad, but could have been done a bit better at times. The combat, even though there were quite a lot of moves to be acquired throughout the game, most of the times felt quite annoying. The vehicle mechanics like skateboard, bikes and go-carts didn't feel bad at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am so ecstatic that this game runs properly on my PC; I was incredibly intimidated by all of the Negative reviews claiming it's broken. Perhaps it's because my PC is an outdated laptop...Others have said it, so I'll be brief: From the developer, you already know that it's an open-world sandbox. Instead of a gangster/criminal/cowboy, you play as an outlaw/thug/ne'er-do-well in a preparatory school. The game is truly like The Warriors + GTA: 3/Vice City/SAndreas, in the mechanics; The game is truly unique otherwise.One of the things that impressed me most about Bully is how they were creative in rewarding players for going to class:Do well in English/Art (I forget which) to learn social skills (so much making-out with chicks).Do well in Chemistry to learn how to make Firecrackers and so forth.Do well in Gym to learn more advanced fighting techniques (or find scrap around the school and give it to the hobo that lives on the grounds, to learn ""super-classified"" fighting techniques).Etc., etc..P.S.: No Rockstar Social Club!EDIT: Huhhhhh, yet again, a port from an old♥♥♥♥♥game is ("")shoddy(""). TO BE SURE, with all of these ports - I am soooo glad to have them in my Library! Classics are classic. So any sort of complaining about the quality of the ports; I only do so to warn others (again, though, the majority (if not the enirety) of the Negative reviews are only Negative because ""the game is broke,""). With Bully, the issues are: Sometimes while running, if you try and look around with the Right Stick, it is unresponsive or doesn't work as intended. Also, sometimes the picture tears and cutscenes get bogged down. These problems have not hampered me in any way, though.As for the game itself, I forgot just how unrelenting the Faculty is in combatting Truancy. Far too often, they will interrupt you while on a Mission because, with the way Time works, there is little breathing room. I'm pretty sure that when I played Bully originally, I just buckled down and went to all my Classes before attempting too many Missions. I enjoy this game, thoroughly; The persistent Prefects only add to the immersion.			",1923,764,56,219,192,19,232

												The reviews on this page are, for the most part, overwhelmingly positive so I decided to try the game and perhaps my expectations were too high based on what other people had written but I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. I haven't played all that much but I don't care to invest anymore time in the game.Technically the game is alright. I find the controls a little clunky. My main gripe is that nothing about the story or the characters appeals to me at all.			",34,4,0,13,1,0,11

												This game surprised me. I enjoyed it very much. To make long story shorts it is like GTA, but action happens @school and nearby (small) city. Graphics are outdated - yes, but there is something going on all the time and I was not bored even for a second. There are lots of cool (non lethal of course) weapons, many ways of transport, tons of clothes which you can use to customize your character.When it comes to story - it is pretty shallow and you know what will happen, but missions and side activities are interesting and are not repetitive.I picked this up during winter sale for like 2 euro and it was totally worth it.

												The Nerd Challenge:Day 1 - I check out the Nerd Challenge. I have to beat the ConSumo score of 1,010. Seems pretty easy. I get to 234 lb., and die.Day 2 - Still, nothing too hard. I can beat it. I have lots of money to spend on this game, anyway.Day 3 - Starting to get a little mad here. I've tried at least 20 times now, and gotten as close as 800 lb..Day 4 - Sumo pushed me into a blowfish. Getting a little angry now.Day 7 - I keep trying and trying, but it's those stupid blowfish.Day 12 - Should I beat up the Nerds? Is this even worth it? I've tried over 50 times now...Day 21 - The Nerd Challenge still sits there. It taunts me.Day 35 - All the Nerds are gone. Technically, I can take the place, but Fatty's high score still sits there.Day 48 - The arcade machine is starting to make a grinding noise. I'm sure it's okay.Day 63 - Pretty sure somone robbed the joke shop upstairs. Why? I don't care. I must beat the high score. I must beat the Nerd Challenge.Day 89 - I've ran out of food down here, in the basement of the joke shop. Gone without food for nearly 10 days now. I refuse to go up. I must complete the Nerd Challenge.Day 99 - I think I've been considered missing. Even dead. Still haven't beat the high score.Day 146 - 999 lb. Then a blowfish got me. They must die.Day 234 - People are knocking on the locked door now. I can't let them break my concentration.Day 304 - The arcade machine stopped working completely. I can't open the door. I'm stuck down here. I've been eating rats that come down here. I think I've ran out of rats.Day 4,321 - I got the acrade machine working again. I beat the Nerd Challenge. Apparently there was a nuclear apocalypse while I was out there. Oh, well.10/10 best Rockstar game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was a fantastic game back in the day of the PS2 era, still is to be honest. It's great when Rock star bring their games to pc, *Cough* Red Dead Redemption *Cough*.So with Bully being developed by beloved RockStar, it was designed from the same vein as GTA...but with kids...and no guns...or killing. Not necessary a major drag, you just get to run around with a super powered slingshot, stink bombs and fire crackers to really annoy people.The game is based around a 15 year kid called Jimmy Hopkins, who is transferred to a boarding school because his mum wanted to go on a 12+ month holiday. Lucky her, eh? So you're the new kid, and you need to work your way up the ranks to be at the top of the school. So naturally no one respects or fears you to start with, even the nerds of the school. So you do the usual mission progression and go through the chapters, which are pretty much like school terms, and you work for different school groups to gain their respect and trust.That's pretty much the jist of the game, other than that it's got you're typical collectables hunt, garage full of vehicles (in this case it's push bikes), shops selling you goods to help you with your carnage, and mini games to help you earn extra cash / abilities.The mini games are kinda fun and can completed fairly quickly. You've got your class room mini games and your 'earn some do$h' mini games. The cash ones are typical teenager jobs, such as a paper route or mowing lawns. But with the class room mini games they help improve Jimmy's abilities, such as chemistry lessons help buff up your chemistry set to create more useful and powerful prank tools. Auto shop gives you better push bikes, English helps you pick up the ladies ;D and so on. The class room mini games can essentially be completed in the first chapter, so no more lessons for the whole year! If only...*Sigh*Quite a lengthy game, if you go for 100% completion. The story is a bit meh and generic, like it's been done in a way before in previous RockStar game. Not going to give too many spoilers now! You'll just have to play and find out ;)  Then again, I could be completely getting one of the GTA games plots all wrong in my head, I hope not.But there are some good moments in the story with memorable, and stereo typical, characters you expect from a US school. Can't say I can really relate to be honest, British high school life is waaaaaaaay different. Thanks for butchering the spirit of The Inbetweeners, USA...An annoying factor to the game is the restriction at night where you can't be out of your dorm past 8 pm, other wise you get chased by the never sleeping prefects and police. If you're out after 2 or 3 am, you automatically get knocked out and appear in your dorm for 8 am. So you can't be a crazy kid and never sleep, ever.I do have to you warn you though, since this was a console port to the PC the controls aren't 100% perfect. So I recommend playing with a controller. Not the keyboard & Mouse!Over all the game isn't too bad, defiantly worth picking up if you have nostalgic feelings towards this game. I know I did, and didn't regret it! :DIn conclusion:  Fairly decent graphics from the PS2 era.  Good story, the game is quite lengthy if you also do the side content.  Excellent alternative to the GTA series, if you're looking for a less violent game.  Plenty of side content to keep a completionist busy for a few hours.  Fun character clothing customising. Make Jimmy look like a right ponce.  Fairly big open world.  Irritating in game hours, in which you have only so many to do stuff in.  Poor port to PC, use a game pad rather than a keyboard & mouse.7 / 10 Get the Go-Kart asap, other wise you won't be able to run the old ladies over fast enough before they dive out of the way.

												The gameplay is fun and this game manages to do a lot even with its Teen rating. You can do the same things you do in GTA games. There are clothing shops, barber shops, and many ways to get around the world like bikes or skateboards. Just like GTA, when the time comes to cause some havoc the option is there. However, Rockstar in their infinite wisdom decided to phone it in on the pc port like they always do. I logged many hours on bully on the PS2 and Xbox, but this version of the game is far inferior. There are severe pop in issues and the options menu is lacking.			",203,24,10,9,21,4,27

												NB: I've played more than the 0.2 hours shown because I had to download a patched .exe from the internet.It seems like a great game but I just can't recommend it on the PC. It's a poor console port with a 30fps lock and very few graphics options. The game will run fine, but it seems that on modern OSs it just isn't worth it. This game crashes constantly on modern systems with more than 2GB RAM (even the patched version).  The fact that there are no autosaves or checkpoints means that the game is pretty much unplayable, since every time you complete something the game crashes and all your progress is reset. Aside from that, the keyboard and mouse controls are absolutely abysmal, some of the worst I've seen on PC. If you are confident in buying this game, make sure you have a controller available. I read some reviews telling me to do this, and didn't heed them. Seriously, unless you have a controller you are absolutely wasting your time.In summary, a good game that's absolutely unplayable without a controller and incredibly restricted by bad porting and game instability.

												Rockstar's known for going a little overboard on the comments from the random passers-by in their games, but this takes that to ridiculous levels. The comments are non-stop and take away any bit of pleasure I may have had with the game. ""Stick it in your ear"" is not something anyone should be forced to listen to every 20 seconds, I don't care what your crime is; well, that is, unless your crime is creating the game ""Bully"". I found myself trying to dodge pedestrians just to save my ears. My goal became to finish missions from the shadows with as little interaction with the game's population as possible.At that point, I found little to no pleasure in playing through the B-movie grade storyline with less than stellar voice acting. Sure, I could have turned the voice volume all the way down, but I would have lost out on the cut scenes too. I'm not saying that's anything to be missed, but, frankly, the game isn't challenging enough to make me want to play it without hearing the cut scenes as well. This review would have gone much better if the developers had added an option to decrease the amount of banter.UPDATE-------------Since I'm obviously in the minority with my negative review, I decided to take a look at the others. I noticed a lot of folks complaining of crashes on Windows 10. I'm playing the game on Windows 10 and was able to play it just fine. The game did crash once when I was attempting to set my resolution, but, outside of that, it ran like a champ. I would disregard the Windows 10 woes. If that was an actual issue, it seems to have been taken care of.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Performance wise it did crash 2-3 times, but overall ran really smoothly for such an ""old-ish"" ps2 game, for me personally, it seemed a really alright port. The controls IMO were quite easy to get accustomed to if you edited them to your liking, played it with keyboard and mouse and persoanlly loved the experience.The world is filled with small interactions and stuff that'll make your stance between missions enjoyable and not make you feel like you are running around in circles in an open world made just for the sake of padding hours in it. It has a great variety of really chrming ""weapons"" that fit completly with the school setting. They managed to make classes incredibly fun, which it's a merit on it's own, from dissecting frogs to cranking a bike the enjoyment of them is quite great, although some do get a little bit tedious over time. Got almost all the classes completed in a single playthrough, but you'll miss a few unless you keep playing after endgame.Customization is alright, but if you change hairstyles you change jimmy's whole face quality/shading/structure which is kinda weird but passable considering the age of the game. Clothes are pretty varied and fun. Story and characters are cliché to a humorous extent, but it's what gives it al lot of the charm this game has. The dialogue is hilarious in most of the cases, mocking everything high school represents and every person you can find in one in a sometimes subtle and sometimes in your face humor that rarely fails to deliver chcukles. Even with all the hilarious, this game does not fail to deliver a great story that let's you taste progression in every part of it. The game did get incredibly easy midway through tho, but was still fun just over how much you can ♥♥♥♥ around the school, the city and the amusment park.Side activities pop up while riding your bike/skateboard/running around town and sometimes on the map if they are ""story-ish"" related, but the non story or ""story-ish"" ones get a little bit repetitive and you'll most likely end up not caring about them because you'll be bathing in money in no time even without doing them.Got 22 hours in it while doing all of the sidequests but 2, almost all the classes, and ♥♥♥♥ing around town very little, if you like collectibles and stuff it will take you quite a while more as there are 2 types of collectibles that are quite large in number. So you'll definetely get a bang for your buck with this game.Definitely my favorite rockstar game, couldn't recommend it enough!			",49,23,1,8,4,2,4

												My brother and I used to play this and got pretty far on the xbox version. so I thought hey! for a cheap game that we had fun with, why not buy the pc version of it. Lolnope. The movement is very annoying and just... kinda not that great on rockstars end for a pc game. I do like the storeline for it but just is an eh for me to try and play it again. Kinda gets old after the bullies are always after you and everything just looks a little depressing.  ",26,23,0,6,5,0,3

												Bully is such a great game! Actually, it's my favorite Rockstar game and that says something. BUT (yeah that was a big but) : Since I've updated my OS from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, the game keeps ♥♥♥♥ing crashing!! So annoying, man...And I have literally tried every ""fix"" there is, and nothing worked properly. Though I've managed to reduce the amount of crashes. On average it crashes like every 30 min. So ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. I mean it's a great game and I would still recommend it but I hope that the fat ♥♥♥♥♥ at Rockstar will get it fixed eventually, cuz those crashes ruin it completely.

												I absolutely love this game, but unfortunately the game starts slowly(Chapter 1), but when you get to the 2th. chapter you cannot stop play it because the story telling becomes much more intimate and you unlock more stuff all the time. And what is better than getting kisses from the girls and drive with go-karts? I'm definitely recommending this game for those who likes even a little bit open world games.IT IS WORTH IT!

												Performance wise it did crash 2-3 times, but overall ran really smoothly for such an ""old-ish"" ps2 game, for me personally, it seemed a really alright port. The controls IMO were quite easy to get accustomed to if you edited them to your liking, played it with keyboard and mouse and persoanlly loved the experience.The world is filled with small interactions and stuff that'll make your stance between missions enjoyable and not make you feel like you are running around in circles in an open world made just for the sake of padding hours in it. It has a great variety of really chrming ""weapons"" that fit completly with the school setting. They managed to make classes incredibly fun, which it's a merit on it's own, from dissecting frogs to cranking a bike the enjoyment of them is quite great, although some do get a little bit tedious over time. Got almost all the classes completed in a single playthrough, but you'll miss a few unless you keep playing after endgame.Customization is alright, but if you change hairstyles you change jimmy's whole face quality/shading/structure which is kinda weird but passable considering the age of the game. Clothes are pretty varied and fun. Story and characters are cliché to a humorous extent, but it's what gives it al lot of the charm this game has. The dialogue is hilarious in most of the cases, mocking everything high school represents and every person you can find in one in a sometimes subtle and sometimes in your face humor that rarely fails to deliver chcukles. Even with all the hilarious, this game does not fail to deliver a great story that let's you taste progression in every part of it. The game did get incredibly easy midway through tho, but was still fun just over how much you can ♥♥♥♥ around the school, the city and the amusment park.Side activities pop up while riding your bike/skateboard/running around town and sometimes on the map if they are ""story-ish"" related, but the non story or ""story-ish"" ones get a little bit repetitive and you'll most likely end up not caring about them because you'll be bathing in money in no time even without doing them.Got 22 hours in it while doing all of the sidequests but 2, almost all the classes, and ♥♥♥♥ing around town very little, if you like collectibles and stuff it will take you quite a while more as there are 2 types of collectibles that are quite large in number. So you'll definetely get a bang for your buck with this game.Definitely my favorite rockstar game, couldn't recommend it enough!			",49,23,1,8,4,2,4

The missions still work but it might not work on your computer (It doesn't work on my laptop so I have to play it on the desktop)Though to be honest if you have an Xbox 360, just grab it on that.

												I've enjoyed Rockstar Games' 'Grand Theft Auto' series ever since the release of 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'. I thought they did a great job technically with their game engines and stylistically with the visual designs. Plus, 'Grand Theft Auto' games are great satire of the crime film/game genre and of contemporary society for the most part. While aware of the negative impact the games can have on society and the younger generation of gamers, I still defend the merits of 'Grand Theft Auto' games.I was pretty stoked when I first read about 'Bully' back in 2005/2006, but was disappointed that the first iteration would not come to the PC platform. About a decade later, I finally got my hands on the remastered version of the game, thinking that Rockstar had injected similar type of technical and stylistic mastery, and social acuity into crafting this game as they did with 'Grand Theft Auto'. Was I wrong. True, in the year 2015, the game engine that runs 'Bully' will definitely show its age; I can accept that. However, 'Bully: Scholarship Edition' looks and sounds very uneven in spite of the remastering. The keyboard and mouse controls for the PC also feel unoptimized.The truth is, I just can't recommend 'Bully: Scholarship Edition'. It simply lacks the energy, fire and humour that I enjoy in 'Grand Theft Auto' games. The setting of Bullworth Academy, while well-designed, just doesn't seem to allow for much exploration. It feels too confined and claustrophobic even when compared to 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City', which was released in 2002. Most importantly, 'Bully' doesn't play or feel like a satire. It is pretty much a straight-up (private) school simulator full of cliques and stereotypes with uninspired early missions.While you may approach 'Bully' and complete missions with good intentions, and that your character implicitly dislikes being bullied, you ironically need to be a bully to accomplish your goals. The unsatirical tone of 'Bully' actually makes me feel horrible for my heinous actions in the game. While I can find some reason to justify my undertaking of violent acts in 'Grand Theft Auto', I find my actions and bullying in 'Bully' to be distasteful.In the end, I guess where 'Bully' fails is that it is too real. Whereas the action sequences, violence and set pieces in 'Grand Theft Auto' were designed to be cinematic, grandiose and hyperbolic -- making the games rather hyper-realistic, all the bullying and hijinx in 'Bully' are mostly possible and hit too close to home for comfort. Given the well documented negative impacts of bullying on people of all ages, I cannot in good conscience recommend 'Bully: Scholarship Edition'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Bully so much on my PS2 when I was young and never had the chance to finish it and get the 100%, and I did all this on the Steam version. It's surely my favorite Rockstar game.-The story is very good, not too complex or outstanding, but it's very good.-The map is not too large, it's even kinda small if compared to other Rockstar titles, but you have anough stuff to do in it, so that's not such a big problem.-The missions are fun, really, really fun.-Side missions are as much fun and entertaining.-Lots of secrets to unlock.-It's addictive and fun to play the whole game, but sometimes it can get a bit repetitive, so you need to take a break when that happens, and come back after some time.-There are bugs, but they never really interfered in my experience, except the people walking around and their sounds being heard from the other side of the map.Also, if you have that bug when you start the game and everything disappear, you can fix this with a patch (just Google search ""bully bug fix"" and you'll probably find it somewhere).

												Completely broken on Win10, regardless of specs the game crashes after ~15 minutes of gameplay.Rockstar seriously needs to address this, I mean, there's no warnings at all that this game doesn't work on Win10; you can still buy this game today, with no warning up until you've bought and launched the game, the only way to actually play it is to roll back to Windows 7/8.1 (not sure if 8.1 even works).I've played the original version on PS2 and completed it numerous times and when it works it's a brilliant game - it's just the PC version is a complete mess and it's virtually unplayable on Windows 10.

I would get to the fight tutorial, and the other boys just kept waving their fists at me indefinitely. Or I would run around and the whole thing would just crash. If it didn't just crash, I would restart it due to some other issue. Like the other comments, I'm running Windows 10, and apparently that's the reason for the issue, but that doesn't make it suck any less.

												I've had this game on consoles and it's been absolutely brilliant. Made by the makers of GTA, it really is like a version of GTA in a school setting. Since it was released I've spent countless hours playing it... but I can't recommend it on the basis that it REALLY doesn't translate well onto the PC. The graphics are bad. Not just bad, I mean to the point of being unplayable and I've got a top end graphics card. It's a shame because the game itself is fantastic, but it really is best left for the consoles!

												Really wanted to enjoy this game, but it's either the general awfulness of the PC port or the fact that the graphics and gameplay really haven't aged well - I couldn't get myself to play past the first few missions. Also, the writing doesn't really work for me - the world doesn't feel anywhere near as real and immersive as the GTA games always have. Still, with halfway decent controls the game would at least have been playable.Can't recommend. If you really must play it on PC, wait until it's 2€ or something on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why is my School in this game?Jokes aside (Actually I'm not) this game is great, the graphics still hold up today and the game is very fun!You are Jimmy, the new kid at Bullworth Academy who is rather untenable and causes a lot of trouble!Classes in this game are fun! Except for English for obvious reasons, when you finish them, you get a new item like a shirt, outfit or a new ability. Weapons are very creative like a Spud cannon, a rubber band ball and a baseball bat you can find.Also everyone in this game has a unquie model, voice and personality, you might see a girl with a boy one day, while the next shes talking to someone else, I have never seen this in any game so far besides the Sims, sadly I haven't seen any of these yet :c

												Pros: Good conceptCons: Everything else, specifically the game content and the apalling interfaceThis is a very poor quality port. I haven't played it on a console, but it's obvious that it's not a PC game. To start with, the mouse control is atrociously bad. I can't see where I'm going and I needed to get a trackpad just to pick locks. The menu interfaces are diabolical: you have to use left shift control and space to select things that a mouse could click just as easily. The fight controls are similarly awful and hard to get the hang of. A mouse click would do the same job as holding r and left shift. Sprinting is a waste of effort too. Who wants to quickly tap shift?On to the game itself. The ""missions"" I've completed so far are so interesting that I want to stick my head in an oven. I had to speak to the headmaster, get some chocolates for a butch neurotic lesbian and walk to two classes. Oh, and then I had to put someone in a bin after chasing them for a few minutes. It's so unengaging I'd rather organise my desktop icons.For a game released in 2008, I can't help thinking that the graphics are a bit substandard too, but that's not really important. The glitchy sound is also very annoying. Oh, and I have to walk to some irrelevant room just to save. That would have been alright if this game was fun like Vice City, but it wasn't fun at all. The walks to the save room just gave me time to contemplate how♥♥♥♥♥♥it was.			",159,35,3,16,19,0,18

												One of the unsung gems of Rockstar, Bully can be aptly described as ""GTA for kids,"" but yet so much more. Don't let that tagline fool you, Bully is nearly as good as, if not better, than its M-Rated cousin, and deserves the cult following. Its missions are high in number but short and sweet, and it's easy to wreak havoc in the schoolyards witout a shred of guilt. More importanty, Jimmy Hopkins is a genuinely likeable character, which is saying a lot considering he's the poster boy for an angsty teenager. One of the better protagonists crafted by Rockstar by far, and simultaneously allow players to cause chaos at Bullworth without the cognitive dissonance and easily slip back into the role of a hero when the story calls for it.It would be wise, however, to skip out on the PC version, which is a lousy port, and go straight for the console versions, either for the Wii or the 360's HD edition.But if you want a short-but-sweet ""Steam style"" review, here's one!I said ""hi"" to a nerd. He tried to punch me in return. A prefect came and kicked his♥♥♥♥♥for me. 10/10.			",239,11,1,16,4,1,13

												seriously rockster. this port is garbage. not only can i not get my ps3 controller working on this game(making me use the fairly crappy pc controls of this game) but also has bad graphic quality with glitchy textures (some area floor failed to load completely for like 10 seconds). your biggest SIN however in this port,  is this bug where it stays on loading screen forever and will never load after waiting like 8 minutes, forcing me to end the game completely. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC!!! BUY IT on console where it's playable and you can enjoy this fantastic game. don't waste money on this bullcrap , rockstar does not deserve money for releasing such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port			",141,8,0,13,4,0,8

												So, all of my hours playing these were spent on the first few tasks, trying to get the damn thing to run properly. I would pause and then the audio would stop. I would get to the fight tutorial, and the other boys just kept waving their fists at me indefinitely. Or I would run around and the whole thing would just crash. If it didn't just crash, I would restart it due to some other issue. Like the other comments, I'm running Windows 10, and apparently that's the reason for the issue, but that doesn't make it suck any less. I played this game so many damn times on PS2, and I was so hype so play it on PC. Welp. Guess not.			",33,74,0,2,7,2,7

												Basically GTA V but at a school and with teens. This game actually has a pretty cool open world and the more main quests you complete the more chapters you complete and the more chapters you complete the more areas open up. In Bully you have to beat all the different groups and then make them your allies (or your enemies). Then once you have all of them on your side so they dont fight you everytime they see you, you have to surprisingly save the school. The different groups include the backstabbing nerds, the narcissist greasers, and the dumb but strong jocks.			",120,46,0,13,6,2,3

												Most people refere to this as a ""terrible port"" or some rude term the chose to say, the truth about this game is that it is an amazing game, has absolutly no lag, and has many ways to customize gameplay. While true it does have it bugs like any good game its an older game that doesn't get so many updates. Most of the people buying this and complaning are people that were looking for something stupid like CoD but cheaper, this game is nothing like CoD its if anything more like Pokemon or Fire Emblem because it has well developed characters and helps make it feel like the character you play as is actually you not just some random person.If your looking for a game with plenty to do, hard to forget characters, and made for any kind of person then Bully: Scholarship Edition is a game you should buy even if it is full price.I honestly give the game an 11/10 and hope for a sequal, remake with more in it (message if you wish to know all), or very similar game by the same company.

												I am very conflicted about what to say. Bully is and always has been my favourite Rockstar game, let alone it being one of my favourite games. Its small and tight focus might seem like a downside but it results in a world more believable and memorable than any other Rockstar game, and all world evolves as you progress through the story with changing seasons and different decorations.That being said, the PC port is even bad by Rockstar standards and this is one of the worst modern ports ever and it's clearly never being fixed. The keyboard and mouse controls are awkward but playable if you don't have a controller, just rebind everything first because the defaults are awful. Some classes are way tougher than they should be on PC and even when they're not they're stuck with awful controls (left shift and right shift for music class!?!?!?), also I had glitches and bugs when I played on Windows 8 but this happened a lot more on Windows 10. Just be warned. Despite all the issues with this incredibly bad port, the game is still Bully and it's still good. If you can look passed it being an awful port then get this. However I strongly recommend playing Bully on Xbox 360 or PS3 unless you're really into the Bully modding scene. Excluding mods which aren't even that amazing, there is no benefit to playing on PC over the consoles that have the Scholarship Edition.			",152,28,3,16,24,0,18

												This is a great blast from the past. Have you ever been bullied. Yes:well this is your chance to fight back! No, I bullied people: Well great uoull fit right in.Pros: Give wedgies, throw people in lockers, skip class, start fights, run from the cops, ride a ferris wheel, destroy gnomes for a carnie, and throwsnowballs at cars, this games great. It has the factions that dominate the schoolgrounds(before the emo/hipster/swag phase) such as the Jocks, Nerds, Bullies, Outcasts, and Greasers(yeah Greasers, bring the spud cannon). You dont have the largest aresnal in a game, but your in school, start off with a slingshot, get a skateboard, build your bicycle, make friends(advance in story) to get more weapons. Some weapons can be learned in class such as the stink bombs and firework launcher.Cons: The games dated, but not terribly. Think of going back to GTA:SA with a Vice city sized map( I guess), no lethal guns, only forms of are your always handy skatebord, and bicycles,no strippers.If you like what Rockstar puts out, but want less ""adult content"" then this is the game for you.

												I am very conflicted about what to say. Bully is and always has been my favourite Rockstar game, let alone it being one of my favourite games. Its small and tight focus might seem like a downside but it results in a world more believable and memorable than any other Rockstar game, and all world evolves as you progress through the story with changing seasons and different decorations.That being said, the PC port is even bad by Rockstar standards and this is one of the worst modern ports ever and it's clearly never being fixed. The keyboard and mouse controls are awkward but playable if you don't have a controller, just rebind everything first because the defaults are awful. Some classes are way tougher than they should be on PC and even when they're not they're stuck with awful controls (left shift and right shift for music class!?!?!?), also I had glitches and bugs when I played on Windows 8 but this happened a lot more on Windows 10. Just be warned. Despite all the issues with this incredibly bad port, the game is still Bully and it's still good. If you can look passed it being an awful port then get this. However I strongly recommend playing Bully on Xbox 360 or PS3 unless you're really into the Bully modding scene. Excluding mods which aren't even that amazing, there is no benefit to playing on PC over the consoles that have the Scholarship Edition.			",152,28,3,16,24,0,18

												Bully is possibly one of my most favorite games, I first played it on PS2 back when I was only 3 to 4 years old. Scholarship Edition is the same game with better graphics. Of course Scholarship Edition is superior to the PS2 version, but suffers from crashes on newer PCs. I don't mind the crashes and I assume Rockstar or some other company will swoop in and fix the games problems when the new Bully comes out. So buy this and have some fun!			",99,3,2,1,7,0,1

He mets a dude called Garry and they become best of friends, but Garry wants to run the school and Jimmy wants to stop bullying little did Jimmy know, Gary is working behind his back and puts him in a ""gladiator"" cage to fight.*Game Mechanics*Game has a nice fighting system witch forces you to do combos for maximum damage (and some OP nut shots),If you want to get max health you have to seduce girls with gifts so they kiss youThere is respect bar of eatch faction, the lower respect is the more chance is that they will attack you on sightAfter you finish the game you will most likely have some stuff to complete since you have to collet 75 rubber bands, 40 G&G Cards, destroy 25 gnomes, 20 tombstones, 30 (i think) pumpkins etc.8.5/10			",44,2,0,1,2,0,0

												Oh Rockstar, why do you do this to us..Within roughly two hours of playing, i've experienced 3 crashes. Luckily I had saved prior but I did experience one during a mission. One when picking up a book from the ground while outside a mission, and one while attempting to give a girl flowers. It's clear the game still has issues from when it was ported. Awkward controls make it evident and the 30fps cap was quite stupid..However... After playing this game on PS2, Xbox360, and even Wii- I have to say it's worth putting up with all its buggy nature simpily to enjoy what is arguablly one of Rockstars most under-rated titles. The music is great, gameplay is solid, and although the PC version isint as polished as the console counterparts, it works and if you can get past a few annoying crashes (also ensure you install the 60fps fix)- you'll have a pretty awesome game at your finger tips.NOTE: The game is great but don't spend $15 on it. I personally got it from GamersGate for $3 but seen it on sale directly on steam for like $5 quite often. The buggy nature is not worth Steam's indicated retail price; however, it is surely is worth $3-5 on sale.			",41,1,2,7,4,0,0

												Fun game! If you're playing ""Bully: Scholarship Edition"" for nostalgic purposes, the game will be an even better experience. That being said, despite the much better graphics than the original version, the game is pretty dated. If you've never played the game before, I wouldn't buy it for more than $5. If you beat the game 100% it's easily over 20 hours of gameplay.			",102,5,5,9,3,0,2

												It's definitely a fun game. Get to live the moments I missed in my own time in high school, like kissing all the girls XDThere's a vast array of missions you can do as well as running errands for some quick cash. It's a great open world game. Story so far seems pretty good too. I have had a few issues with the game however. There are some random lags I get as well as the mouse not working too well. Which can be annoying depending on the mission (ie aiming in first person, sometimes the mouse will jump past the target making me have to restart) as well as having experienced a never ending loop of the load screen and characters freezing during animations, forcing a game restart. The last 2 examples have only happened to me once each, so it seems to be a rare event, but thought I should mention it.With that said, if you save often, it's not a game breaking problem and I've really enjoyed this game.

												From playing this on the xbox 360 many years ago, I can say this is one rockstars greatest masterpieces; but if you're looking to play this on windows 10 then don't bother. Due to a fault in the game, crashing is an inevitable occurance if you're using the windows 10 operating system so if you want to play it, go elsewhere.			",94,8,1,6,5,0,3

												This is an incredible game, everything ranging from the story, the characters, the gameplay, everything just feels right, as if in very clean, Bully is a very cleanly design game, amazing.With that being said tho, the actual port for this game it's terrible, terrible as in the game crashes after some time playing making you loose hours and hours of progress, this game like plenty of other Rockstar games has a saving system that requires you to be in an specific place in the game.Forcing me to retry hours upon hours of mission time that i've already completed it's an incredible way to make me forget about your game.Which is a shame, because as I said, the game, at its core, it's amazing, it's a wonderful experience for plenty of different reasons.I just wished Rockstar had embraced their new mentality of actually dedicating time and effort in their pc ports, when this game was released for pc Rockstar still thought having games running with limited options, 30 fps locks, and frequent crashes, was a fine thing to do.For games like this one that are games clearly made with effort, and passion, it's kinda sad to see them getting ditched and frown upon pc players, simply because Rockstar decided not to dedicate enough time to the pc port.This is one of those rare cases in which I would also not recommend you to try it even after thinking there might be fixes for this issues, there IS a fix for the game running at 30fps, there is however not a fix for the constant crashes that simply KILL the game for me, and plenty of other different people, if only there were some type of autosaving, or quicksaving feature, this would still be a problem, but it wouldn't be such a serious one at that, sadly tho, with this game there's no such thing, and as end result as amazing as the game is, as incredibly as my desire to recommend it stands in its own for what the concept behind the game holds, and is, I cannot recommend this game for pc, it just doesn't make sense in the least.Sorry, but this game deserves better, and your consumers as well Rockstar.

												Having gotten this game back in Christmas 2007, I was young (10) and I fell in the love with the game. I loved the music, the humour, the characters, the brilliant attention to detail and most of all... the replay value. I have re-played and completed this game over Twenty-Seven times! Twenty--Seven... when have you ever loved a game sooooo much you played it Twenty-Seven times to the end? The fact is this is the perfect game. Perfect setting, perfect characters and an insane amount of fun! This game will never leave my mind, and I'm STILL waiting for a sequel. RockStar surprise us. Bring us Bully 2 and make it good. It will be hard to recapture the beatuy that is Canis Canem Edit, but if anyone can do it.. its RockStar.			",163,21,1,12,20,1,1

												A bit buggy, yet still funny and long game. Unlike the most modern games, this doesn't take 8 hours to beat the story, it takes twice as long.			",88,2,2,5,1,1,3

												Pros:- Pretty much a soft-core version of GTA.- A lot of NPC's, each with different ( and funny ) dialogue.- Made by Rockstar.- Six different cliques, all unique, including Nerds, Jocks, Preppies, Bullies, Greasers, and Townies.- You can attend classes ( which are pretty fun minigames which you can unlock extra items from )- Instead of guns, you get makeshift weapons like fire-crackers, stink bombs, a slingshot, and even rotten eggs.- You can beat up old ladies.- Completely non-linear.- You can save people from the bullies, or even bully them yourself.- Instead of stealing cars, you can steal bikes, and scooters.Cons: - For a game made in 2008, the graphics don't seem that up-to-dateRating: 10/10Don't think, just buy this game! c:			",476,68,9,42,30,4,42
