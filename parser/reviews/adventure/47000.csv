												Nice relaxing game that is basically a match 3 (or more gems) game.There is a hidden object scene at the end of every chapter to mix things up a bit.It can get more challenging as the game progresses, and you can't replay previously completed stages unless you restart the game.

												Probably the best casual game that I have played in a while. Levels are challenging after the half way point, not too hard to cause you to stop playing though. Can sometimes appear to be repetitive but it then adds something else to the gameplay to change the dynamic of it. Very enjoyable. Would recommend. 9/10.			",944,268,79,89,125,17,147

Short Verdict: 4 Elements is a fun match-3 game that doesn't get old quickly. Instead of aiming for points, your objective is to make your way through the levels by breaking the path with your matches. It was a great surprise--I didn't expect much, but ended up having some fun for a few hours! Pros: Innovative mechanic on the match-3 genre Total of 64 basic levels, plus 4 hidden-object and 16 spot-the-difference levels, making it just long enough for this kind of game Smart puzzles that require fast thinking A unique atmosphere in each ""world"" Excellent difficulty advancement--you'll find it too easy at first, but it'll get harder as you move on Special powers add another layer to the puzzles Pleasant BGM and cute graphicsCons: Terrible (almost non-existent) story, but who cares? Fixed very low resolution HO and STD levels were really annoying, mostly because of the low res, making me just click around like crazy Boring animations and character cards (that you collect to progress in the game)Bought on / for: Razor Bundle by Bundle Stars for an average of US$0.35 (R$ 0,91). Definitely worth it! I wouldn't pay its full price, though.			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												A wonderful casual game combining hidden objects, spot the differences and a rather elaborate match 3 gameplay, fit for kids and adults alike. It's a great time sink.What this game does well:1. The artwork is beautiful.2. The Match 3+ puzzles are based on a maze-type ""map"" where you need to find your way from your starting position to the end, rather than a simple X by X board. Aided by 4 usable rechargeable items, you need to make your way to the end of the maze by any means necessary. And there are also explosions when you match 5 or more gems!3. The hidden object games are nice and challenging.4. The spot the differences game is lot's of fun - some puzzles are quite tough, too.What this game does poorly:In my opinion - nothing, really... I guess the spot the differences puzzles could have had more differences to spot, but then again, it works fine as it is.The conclusion:A magnificent casual 5+ hours game, with wonderful artwork and fun gameplay, which would cost you under 1€/$ on sale (like right now). This is cheaper than a bag of peanuts or chips, or a beer and will provide you with way more hours of enjoyment. What's not to like?			",197,65,0,53,50,0,48

												4 Elements is a fun match-3 puzzler weighed down by unnecessary seek-and-find sequences and occasionally frustrating level design. 4 Elements' generic fantasy presentation hides an addictive game that will appeal to fans of Bejeweled and other ""casual"" puzzle titles. There's nothing wrong with story in a puzzle game, but with the relatively low resolution of the somewhat blurry art in the seek-and-find sequences, gamers will want the title to get out of its own way and let the real game breathe.4 Elements tells a simple story of an ancient evil that was locked away by the power of the titular elements — earth, wind, fire and water — but has now been unleashed. It's up to the player to unlock four books to release the elements and save the realm. It's inoffensive and flat, but the story is bolstered by a fairy who accompanies the player and periodically provides tips and hints. Unlike some other games that have overused the ""helper"" character while not allowing the player to discover and explore, the fairy is here to explain the various rules and power-ups and won't get in your way.The main gameplay of 4 Elements involves creating chains of three or more jewels of the same colour to clear a pathway for a liquid to reach the tree at the end of each level. The 64 timed levels are large and sprawling, with multiple pathways and strategies for the player to take. There are 16 levels per ""element,"" and the colours and visuals change depending on which element you're playing, adding a bit of variety to the proceedings while playing; as you progress, the levels become harder, longer and with more obstacles. For example, you might stumble upon a stone that can only be destroyed via a bomb power-up, or a frozen tile that must be chained several times before breaking.There are environmental tricks, as well, with arrows that help clear large sections of the level when the liquid reaches them. There are several power-ups, such as the aforementioned bomb, the ability to swap any two regular jewels, ""dig"" out a tile to make way for another, and a power-up that reshuffles all jewels in the level besides stones and frozen tiles. Some jewels sit on more than one layer and must be cleared several times, as well. The time limit is rarely going to make players nervous, but it does add a good bit of tension as players scramble to reach the tree after a long journey.Supplementing the main gameplay are four hidden object sequences to find the key to each elemental book. The still paintings, while pretty, are a bit washed out on both the top screen and the touch screen, making it difficult to find each item. The fairy is available to point players in the right direction, but these sections feel like filler. There are also near-identical cards that require the player to spot the differences, which are short and relatively simple, but the small pictures on the card had us resort to pixel hunting and tapping the screen until we found something; these sequences aren't challenging so much as frustrating, and feel extraneous to the rest of the game.Although the colours seem a little washed out, the visuals are lovely and soft, evoking a fairy tale fantasy realm. The music and sound effects are quite soothing and peaceful, and the pay-off to a large combo or clearing a huge section of a level with ""whoosh"" and ""ringing"" sounds is surprisingly effective. The top screen is used as a map, while the bottom screen is where the action takes place. There is not much 3D implementation here, but it's not missed.Though 4 Elements is hampered by its filler hidden object/seek-and-find sequences, the puzzle gameplay is very fun and surprisingly involving. So while it's not the perfect puzzle game, players could certainly do worse. For a lengthy and well-crafted experience, 4 Elements is recommended; just be ready to do some pixel hunting in-between matching those jewels.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Among many casual games that I've been playing, I took a particular liking towards this one, visiting it over and over again just to take my mind off something now and then. Is there anything extraordinary? Nah, not really. But it has a story at least.The Magic Land - yeah, this is the name of the realm that we are in. Creative I know, bear with me for the time - is in turmoil! The altars of the 4 Elements fell into ruin and the careful balance of nature is tipped off to result in catastrophes all over the place, so it is our casual gaming skills that shall save the Magic Land. With our trusted fairy companion - that girl is useful, I tell you - we are to unlock the books of 4 Elements and bring peace to the realm once again! For a casual game, it comes with a story and some lore about magical creatures. I must say that's a bonus.4 Elements is an entertaining, casual puzzle game that takes attention, quick-thinking and resourcefulness. Rules are very simple: your aim is to open a path way for the energy flow through the puzzle board labyrinth within a time limit, by matching as many possible same colored stones at a time. Your casual Match 3 game. It starts easy enough, and progresses to become 'what the heck I'm doing, I wonder???'. It has some HOG and “Find the Difference” scenes between chapters that are moronically hard: I couldn't decide whether they are a plus or a minus.The game itself is kinda addictive. You find yourself passing an hour or two, then realize that you've just lost that hour, which is the exact purpose of these games. Theme is really pretty, and the design is well above the average. I'd recommend it to whomever that looks for a fancy Bejeweled alternative with flashy gameplay and needs a game that doesn't use much brain activity rather than some attention span.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												This is a different take on Match 3 genre. The story isn't anything spectacular (just read the About), but the games themselves are pretty good. Overall, the game isn't really difficult. Some of the later levels may require multiple tries to figure out the best strategy to make your way through.The gems do not require swapping. Instead, you draw a line through them to make a chain. The longer the chain, the bigger the explosion to wipe out surrounding gems, rocks, and other obstacles. The levels themselves are comprised of a long path that weaves its way to the destination. You must reach the destination before time runs out (the green bar on the right side). Sometimes, you must use power-ups to make your way through. The power-ups are charged when long chains are made. The longer the chain, the faster the power-up charges. The camera will stay still until you clear a path to allow the magic to flow further through the level.The game is divided into 4 parts (books), of which the following happens: A hidden object game preceeds a book in order to unlock it. Not only must you find the parts to objects, but then you must use the object to interact with something on the scene. Eventually the key is found to unlock the book. Once it is unlocked, there are 4 sets of 4 levels, each followed by a spot-the-difference game. In the higher levels, more differences must be found. Once the 4 sets are completed, it moves to the next book.The biggest problem with the game is the low resolution graphics. Even though it says it was made in 2008, they still could've used better graphics or at least provide a HD remaster. On 1920x1080, the grainy images for the hidden object and spot-the-differences mini-games made it somewhat difficult to complete. Putting it in windowed mode didn't help because then the images are just too small. A minor annoyance I had was the counter in the top-right corner of the screen. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off.Overall, the game is worth the cost for Match 3 type casual game fans. The level design makes it a bit different from the common single screen ones.---For more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...  Group | Curator Page ",281,360,6,69,107,2,86

												4 Elements is an old tile matching game where you instead of moving tiles around to form links just point out to the game links that are already there. It takes you through a fairly lengthy single-player campaign and even manages to mix in a few Hidden Object and Spot the Difference mini-games. It is however not a game that can stand up to the more modern tile matching games and it's attempts at branching out, through the use of a small storyline and the previously mentioned hidden object games, does not add much to the experience.The gameplay is simple enough, you have to lead a liquid from the start of a maze to the end by matching tiles to open up paths. Most of it is pretty straight forward but the game does add in a few special puzzles and traps as you progress however the really interesting ones only show up in the very last levels and you don't really feel challenged until then. You get a few special abilities that are charged by matching tiles of a specific color however their use is mostly limited to the areas where they are required to progress.One bug that kept annoying me throughout the game was that the on-screen arrow that shows you which direction you need to go always blocks your view of a tile.All in all there is not much to see here. The game is not impressive or interesting and the fact that the individual levels are fairly lengthy means it does not even qualify as a decent timesink. Not a good game to buy.

												4 Elements are the 4 worlds of this game: Earth, Fire, Wind and Water.Such a lovely game with a little Tinkerbell like helping fairy and faboulos drawings of landscapes and creatures. The graphics are so sweet. Unfortunately the resolution is fixed to 800 x 600. Could be HD. A really relaxing and outstanding soundtrack. Love this instrumental music. Panpipes, whistles, guitar and piano.Like every puzzle game it starts easy. Connect some chains with min 3 tiles ... but then the hardness raises quickly. Destroy stone blocks make longer chains. But it's much more. Every book part level has it's own break to solve a ""spott-the-differences"" minigame. Really not easy. To enter a new book you have solve a ""quest"", meaning search a big picture for several item parts. It's unnatural hard. But if you proceed you'll get into the game and enjoy the thrill of puzzeling. The last two levels are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You have to quick solve chains and may need many tries ...Highly recommend as a classic puzzlegame			",1640,665,58,135,164,17,216

												4 Elements is a simple, fun, relaxing game. The objective of each level is to clear the blocks, which destroys the path below them, which allows the water to progress. The goal is to get the water from the start to the finish. As the levels progress, the size of the board increases and obstacles pop up. Destroying colors builds toward power ups. Collecting green blocks builds towards a shovel that allows you to dig away a piece of the path, for example. Making long chains creates explosions to destroy obstacles like ice. While the game is designed with a ticking clock each level, I think I only ran out of time maybe twice just from bad luck on what colors came my way. It's not really difficult. After a few boards, the game switches things up with some puzzles where you need to find the differences in two pictures or search for hidden objects. Many of these items/differences are extremely well hidden, basically blending into the backgrounds, which made that a bit of an annoyance. I had a few times where I just went click crazy all over the screen.There are A LOT of levels in this game. After a while I thought it would never end, so it does feel like it stretches out a bit too long. It's still fun and completely worth a play through, though I can't see me playing it again anytime soon. There are more addictive casual games out there.			",3274,1361,136,411,467,43,550

												Excellent puzzle game to be played WITH the kids but not to be played just by the kids themselves. This is more a game for adults who want a bit more challenge from their casual games.  Game requires quite good mouse handling skills as you are constantly drawing paths back and forth on the screen to create as long gem chains as possible. You must also be able to think fast what gem colors do you need to collect in order to get a specific tool or bomb to get past a barrier. Especially in the later water and air levels time limits are quite tough and usually if you fail to quickly break out of the starting section of the map you might as well restart the level as time is quite scarce. Every now and then there are nice 'find the difference' between two similar pictures sections and clearing up temples by finding pieces of artifacts scattered around the screen.

												Casual match-the-stone puzzle game.  It's relaxing, with high production values but mediocre level design.  They could have done so much more with this.  The second-to-last level (level 63 out of 64) was the first one that was really interesting.  Level 64 has a sudden difficulty spike which was not logical in the context of the rest of the game's super-easy difficulty, but I enjoyed it.  That said, level 63 and level 64 (out of a total of 64 levels) being interesting was far too little, far too late.+Good production values.+Stable.  Didn't crash on me a single time.  (Sad that this cannot be taken for granted these days.)-No interesting learning curve or progression.  Level 62 is not much more difficult than level 2.-Boring level design.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A 2008 3 match game developed by app designers Playrix (https://www.playrix.com/)There are a lot of OLD negative reviews based on the fact that the game crashes at start up etc. Also that there was no feedback from company which was surprising since they have over 450 employees. However since Mar 7 2017 there was an update and quite a few have remarked since then that game is now fixed and I myself had no problem with game working at all. I guess the moral of the story is check specifications before buying, and that Playrix really needs to work on its customer feedback, playing a more proactive role.Though the game is a 3 match I really found that it had a rather unique concept in comparison to other 3 matches I have played. Basic goal is to restore 4 elemental magic books, earth, fire, wind and water. To unlock a book you need a key, which you will find amongst an array of objects in a HOS. Once that is completed you are treated to 4 three match games followed by a relatively easy spot the difference this will give you a short read about the magic of a mythical character such as a faerie, a water turtle, a  unicorn or something of the like. Repeat this procedure three times in total and you will unlock all the locks to one of the four books and may then proceed to the next one to repeat the process until you have finished all 65 levels or thereabout levels, learnt all about the magical inhabitants of this mythical world and then rainbows will appear over the Kingdom, the end.The first two books are so easy thanks to the large generous amount of time allocated to the completion of each level that you could probably watch grass grow between each match up and still successfully complete each level. The last two books on the other hand are so strapped for time you'll probably have to go back to the doctor’s tomo and get yourself a heavier prescription. For instance the last level took me around 16 minutes and I was flying around the map like I was a cat in a room full of rocking chairs.The main objective of the 3 match puzzles is to get a fluid from the start point to the altar, its exit goal. Unfortunately dirt, blocks and ice often prevent your path. By matching 3 or more gems in a horizontal or vertical fashion will remove the dirt. Making a 5 match adjacent to ice will cause an explosion that will move that obstacle and as for the cement blocks you will have to locate an explosive spear and let the liquid meet that for the spear to shoot off and make contact with another spear or the cement block and obliterate that obstacle. The journey can be quite long as you make the liquid traverse through tight narrow passages and patterned chasms. You have some power ups also at your disposal depending on which colour gems you match up. A spade will unlock one block of dirt (green gem), a bomb can take out the ice and rocks (red gem), a switch will change the position of a pair of gems of your choosing (yellow gem) and random will randomise the gem layout again when you get limited in good options (blue gem).The game is unique not only for its mechanics, it's board fancy grandiose lay out, but also thanks to its background animations, such as an assortment of fish swimming around in a gigantic aqua world or the waterfalls that emit from the mouth of the altar when your fluid reaches them. Not to mention the barrage of explosions that can occur when you come across a cluster of explosive spears like as if you’re watching a Michael Bay Movie about 3 match extremists.In final the first two books are really boring they take too long explaining the game, the last two books are worthy of a gamer's attention. Hopefully they will continue with this idea looking into 4 other magical elements like Xanox, Mushroom, Moonshine and Testosterone.			",1241,555,53,82,123,5,127

												4 Elements is a gem-matching puzzle game that won't challenge your brain too much.  Four elemental books need to be unlocked and pieced back together, and each starts off with a hidden object puzzle to find the key.  Once you unlock a book, you start working on the meat of the game: matching gems to clear a path for the energy contained at the starting point.  The energy spreads as you match gems to remove environmental obstructions beneath them, and your goal is to clear a path for it to flow to the objective.  Maps can be quite large with multiple rooms and corridors and all types of obstacles, and time is limited.  There are four powerups that help you get past difficult situations.  After each four puzzle levels, a page of the book and an art card illustration is completed. You play a short minigame where you spot the differences in the cards.64 puzzle levels, 16 spot the differences puzzles, 4 hidden object puzzles.  Graphics are nice but locked at 800x600. Very casual.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												I put some time into this game in order to complete it. This game is somewhat appealing as it consists of roughly three types of minigames. The structure is pretty much the same. First you do a hidden object minigame, which then allows you to play 4 match 3 levels. The RNG is pretty fair, although sometimes I found that I could breeze through a level after a few attempts and restarts. The final level is a ""Spot-the-difference"" level. Unfortunately as with the hidden objects game, I just randomly clicked around until I completed the task. At first I was trying to actually find the things, but I realised quickly that there would be a  modicum of tedium involved. I did enjoy it, but it wasn't so much a game you play for the story. I don't even know what the story was. I just skipped as much of it as I could.If you can get the game in a bundle or when it is on sale, I say go ahead.			",540,107,26,83,76,3,66

												What can I say, I want nothing more than to say this is a juvenile puzzle game with a cutesy story, and zero real plot development and terrible graphics and gameplay.Most of that however is not true.Yes, this game does look like it's aimed at the younger casual player, and yes, the story is sugar fried in honey, and the plot is merely a device to keep you playing the game... and yes - the graphics are by no means revolutionary... But by the gods is this game addictive.After playing the obligatory amount to formulate a review, I found myself determined to finish the game, which involves firstly 'Unlocking' one of four books of elements - cue an object-finding puzzle, which doesn't penalise you for being slow at, and it's just as well, because the puzzles are very intricate, and have several 'layers' of object mechanics. You may need to find an object to uncover a button which opens a chest which has part of another object inside - and so on. Once you've solved the puzzle and opened the book, you are faced with the task of collecting four 'cards' featuring a different mythical creature or race. You do this by playing two different puzzles - a series of 'spot the difference' games, and the main bulk of the game: a series of four puzzles whereby you must direct the flow of 'magic' to a given point by destroying groups of gems. The plot is all by-the-by if you just want to play the puzzles, which is great, because the storytelling isn't exactly stellar. But the gameplay more than makes up for it.I dare you not to become addicted to this game - and determined to keep playing until you finish the last book!I've recorded a short gameplay video of the beginning sequence, which documents how to play all three different types of puzzles:

												(EDIT:  Slightly updated for 2017, comments in parenthesis.  Runs without issue on Win 7x64)WARNING:  Lots of recent bad reviews and hate because people can't get the game to work under Windows 10 and the game seems to have been broken for some in Win 7.  DO YOUR RESEARCH on this OLDer and now apparently abandoned game by the devs.Here is a complex fix that I would not be willing to go through to make this little game work.http://steamcommunity.com/app/47000/discussions/0/451848855003818400/Still keeping my upvote since the game is running fine for me on Win 7x64, but I'm tempted to downvote simply because the Devs and Steam are not making these issue avoidable and this is basically a cash grab title no longer supported.After you research, if you think you can run it on your hardware, buy it for 60 cents or less.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Very casual game.  Nice to pass the time.  If your looking for a challenge, look elsewhere.(Other than dealing with timers, I was never challenged by this game.  It is almost a mindless clicker, but fun if you like Match 3 games.)Currently about 75% through the game and have never been ""stuck"" and seldom need to use the power-ups.  (Finished the game the day after I wrote the review in 2014 without any effort or retries.  Total time invested so far, 18 hours).My only significant complaint is the lack of resolution options and replayability.  Your limited to a fuzzy fullscreen  or a slightly too small windowed mode.Can't replay earlier levels unless you start a new game.$2 well spent.  (Current lowest price is .59 cents and has also been bundled a few times).			",716,212,19,84,54,3,56

												Fun little matching game.  The jewels are either floating on a platform, embedded in ice or on a strong platform where you must match pieces to break the platforms/ice to allow for water or lava to reach the final destination tree at the end of each level.  Nice casual game.  Easily recommended since it's so relaxing and not tense at all.  There are some fun mini-games like hidden object games every 16 levels or find what's different between two similar pictures every 4 levels.  Overall, well worth your time if you find it at the right price.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												This is a simple but fun timed puzzler. The gameplay is excellent: simple, solid mechanics, good level design, nice graphics and sound produce a game which is fun and, in later levels, challenging enough to give a sense of achievent when you complete the game. The only weakness in the gameplay is occasional visability problems caused by the automatic camera and direction arrow. This problem is rare however, it took me several playthroughs to encounter it. The game also features Spot-the-Difference levels, which add little, and occasional Hidden-Object levels, which are diverting and challenging.Unfortunately, the presentation and ""story"" are as cliched as anything I have ever witnessed in a game. If you find bad fantasy irritating, I advise you to click to continue whenever prompted.If you enjoy timed puzzle games, this one is worth getting. I recommend waiting for a reduced price, they are quite frequent.			",104,74,9,15,18,1,49

 9/10  - Puzzles 5/10  - Story Achievements  - Easy 100% completion (around 8 hours)This is fun for a short and casual puzzle game. It's an easy game to get 100% achievements--took me around 8 hours for all achievements (around 5 hours to beat). Just buy it for 75% or more off because it's only worth a few bucks--unless money isn't a concern to you. The Puzzles: Most of the puzzles are match 3-style puzzles that are easy. I only had to repeat a few levels. The final levels are a little challenging but nothing to break your keyboard over. There are other puzzle elements in the game such as finding hidden objects in pictures. I thought these were annoying as I only wanted the game for the match 3 puzzles, and you have to beat them in order to progress through the game (unlock all elements/levels). Luckily, there aren't that many, and I didn't find them so challenging or annoying as to not beat the game and all achievements.  The Story: I got the game for the puzzles, so I found the childish fantasy story annoying. It wasn't so bad as to keep me from beating the game, but even with as fun as the match 3 puzzles were, I have not played the game again since beating it and completing all achievements.Updated for formatting and mechanics.

												A proeminent name in the early life of the Match3 Era. 4 Elements is starting to show some age with its mechanics - visual polish and sound given the flood of recent additions to genre thanks to the casual tablet market. However it still is charming in that it offers a change of pace with different mini-games to solve in sequence and some sort of prototype story in which you unlock pages of elemental books. The art style and overall mood is still pleasant for today's market as well. If you enjoy this genre you might enjoy unlocking the achievements for this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to wait until I completed this game to sing its praises and I'm glad that I did.  They saved the best two stages in the game for last.  (Good on you, you cheeky buggers.)'4 Elements' would make a charming addition to any puzzle-lover's collection as well as those with a taste for casual games.  With most stages taking no more than five minutes each, the ability to save and quit at any given time, even in the middle of a puzzle and continue at your convenience, the creators have clearly put a great deal of thought into smoothing out not only the mechanics of the game, but the way it is presented to you, the player.'The baby's crying?  Dinner is ready?  Don't worry--we'll leave this just as you left it.'Everything within this simple puzzle title is polished to perfection:The artwork and related 'find the difference' mini-games are masterpieces on their own, especially in the way that they are assembled according to your progression.  Every click of a button results in a harmonious tap or chime, rewarding your headway with a rush of flowing water or wisp of wind, weaving an encouraging musical atmosphere as you restore the world around you.  The stages themselves have a smooth difficulty curve as well, challenging enough to feel rewarding and encourage creative strategies without leading you to frustration.A brilliant puzzle game and highly recommended.  I look forward to a sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4 Elements: This is your basic puzzle type game, It starts you out with a decent story and some back round though really never explains the story in detail. The game its self will take you about 9 hours to play though if you need to restart a few missions, I had to on the last 2 of them since they pretty much make you rush a few parts which I found hard to keep up at times. Over all I really enjoyed this game, it was like bejeweled mixed with a new things. I can say if your looking to get this game for a kid it is well worth it. My self being about 25 I found it just as fun as the many other games I have played. It was a nice relaxing game that made you think before you did every move. Pro's:Has 64 levels that progressively get harder as you play.Perks when you get stuck, or have no way of getting past one area fast.Your fairy will randomly mix the jewels when there are no more move's left which made it more relaxing and fun.They give you hints when you get stuck, and there are some points where you will need it if you have bad eyes.Con's:Levels are timed and sometimes you will make it 1or 2 secs after timer runs out (done this on a few levels/missions which dose give you the win).I found the game to go from easy to hard vary fast then back down to easy. The tips the fairy gives you helps though not by much.When you get to the last few rounds, the power-ups take a lot more to charge up and even take more jewels the more you use them (last two levels I found this). Over all I would recommend this game for its fun Bejeweled style look and its short story. Just remember this is one of those games you can knock out in a night, so take your time.

												This is a pleasant match-three puzzle game with some good art and polish, and it's not too long.In this game, you have to dig through a bunch of dirt so that some liquid can flow to the end of the level. You dig by eliminating tiles on top of the dirt. The camera scrolls on its own as it follows the liquid, and you can't scroll back to earlier parts of the level, so you have to deal with only what you see on the screen. Sometimes the randomness will deal a bad hand, but you can get out of trouble with planning and clever use of powerups.I admit, I first thought it was a bit easy and simplistic for my tastes -- there are only four colors to match, and the powerups were a bit too powerful. About halfway through the game, I realized the main enemy was the timer, and it could put up a good fight. Later levels got fast and frantic as I had to dig through huge levels in only a few minutes, and the final few levels were quite a satisfying challenge.Overall, it was pretty good! It seems like something straight out of the golden age of PopCap. If you have fond memories of Zuma, Bejeweled, Chuzzle, Bookworm, and the like, you might find this very enjoyable. For achievement hunters, this is a no-brainer. Get it on sale for an easy 5-7 hour perfect game.			",311,69,5,34,15,2,47

												Yet another ""match 3""-like game. Though, this time, no tile to move but tiles to select, starting at 3 that have at least one border in common. The more you link, the better. At 5 linked (or more) an explosion happens, clearing more background and tiles. Some more options can be set during the game (bomb, swap tile, etc.), provided you filled them up first. Throught the four books, representing the elements, there are four ""find the differences"" mini games per book, and one other ""find the object"" mini game per book. That's the basic of gameplay. Design wise, it's a very pleasant trip. The graphics are beautiful and music is relaxing. ""4 Elements"" starts easy but quickly becomes challenging. Near the end, it leans towards the very difficult. Around the last levels (amongst 66) the automated camera may show a part of the screen that isn't very useful. And that's  about the only issue I've found.			",17,87,0,18,6,0,12

Altogether it felt like a nice way to waste some moments when there wasn't much time to invest on longer games. Giving some context for rather abstract game was nice bonus. Personally I would've preferred if the game would've been purely match-3's sections without ""hidden object"" and ""find differences"" sections, but to each their own. At least they weren't take that long to solve, even if random clicking was involved. And speaking of taking time, one major con comes from last levels were taking about 30 minutes or so against time limit. Not that casual game anymore. Still, positive experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd recommend this when it is on sale - it's nice to play a casual match three game without constantly being spammed by flashing adverts or demands for money to buy lives, energy, sausages and... whatever other nonsense the developer decided to put in to scam money out of people. 2008 was a much simplier time...Otherwise I probably wouldn't recommend it though solely because... it's from 2008. That means 800x600 resolution that messes with my desktop and results in other programs getting rescaled and thrown all over the place and my monitor flashing up a warning to change the resolution every time I start the game. There is no option to change the resolution... because it was 2008 and 1080p was like something out of 2001.Your options are limited to playing fullscreen with horribly stretched graphics and the desktop suffering or playing in a tiny window too small to see anything. As I say... fun if it is cheap and on sale but otherwise probably not worth it.			",18,4,0,2,5,0,5

												Picked this up for 99 cent. You have to restore the elements by making chains of the same colored gems. The basics are simple but the obstacles get harder and sometimes you will have to play a level multiple times before you know how to clear it. But it never got me frustrated so the difficulty level was perfect for me. There are 64 levels, and in between there are some other puzzles to restore the books of elements. This game kept me busy for about 9 hours, so that is good value for just 99 cents.			",22,38,0,27,27,0,9

												This is a excellent 3+in a row game, with dashes of spot the difference and hidden object thrown in. Some varied powerups add to the strategy side of it and at times can really be a game changer. Great for a doing a couple of levels here and there or for when you are not in the mood for a serious game session. Not massively challenging though that's half it's beauty; a relaxing game at which you can amble along taking you time. A very basic story helps join all the levels together and keep the flow of game going.Highly recommended, just don't expect anything jaw dropping.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 What Is This? This is a connect three style puzzle game. You must beat the timer or lose the level. Reach the end of each level by matching chains of same-coloured stones to clear a pathway. Higher scores, and explosions, are earned by forming ever larger chains of stones. At the end of each chapter is a spot-the-difference mini-game to complete.The story is simple but enjoyable. Definitely worth the few bucks it asks for if you're just looking for a game that will relax far more than frustrate. Perfect for the kids, lovers of puzzles/puzzle games or non-gamers.

												DON'T BUY IT! I love puzzle RPGs but this was really boring and repetitive. Only played through it because of my OCD for achievments and feeling like I wanted to get my moneys worth. You only get 4 spells which you get in the first area or two and use throughout. The spot the difference puzzles were too easy even when windowed so I could barely see the pictures. The object finding puzzles were entertaining but there are only 4 and most of the items are really easy to spot with a few being almost impossible to see. Only the last few levels were interesting. Also I got excited about voice acting at the start but that is the only time there is any, not even some at the end.Basically I am minutely irritated that I have spent £5 on it and many hours of my life. Why didn't I just play puzzle quest. Could have completed it by now.			",458,124,5,65,38,4,82

												This is a pretty decent match 3 game. Unlock other math 3 games, you match the pieces together to clear a path through to the end. It's fun if you are in to this kind of game. There are about 60 levels, and they ramp up difficulty decently, but it would have been nice for there to be more levels, or perhaps randomly generated levels. Something to keep it going longer. Still, it took me several hours to beat and I enjoyed it.One thing that annoyed me is that every so often you have to do a ""spot the difference"" or ""find the hidden object"" game. These just annoyed me, and I really don't think they needed to be included. Luckily they have a hint button so if you don't care about these you can get through them quickly.As for the graphics, it's about as you would expect from this kind of game. Colored gems representing the elements. The theme is kind of boring as it is just generic fantasy. You have a little fairy to give you tutorials throughout the game. Still, match 3 doesn't lend itself to having great themes. Gems, candies, what have you, is what people go for. It works. There is just nothing theme wise that stands out.Anyway, while not an absolute must have, if you like games of this ilk, might as well give it a try if you see it on sale.			",209,76,6,38,27,4,62

												Mini games and colour maching the game.introduction:To start out with, you are introduced to the story, wich involve the elements running amok in a magical world. We are told to restore peace to each element; earth, wind, fire, and water. On the menu screen we can see all the levls representet by books and gems, and we get an idea of how long this game is going to take.Therefore I felt the introduction to be really boring. It shows the whole game from the get go, and there are no surprises along the way. Then again for a game like this, you would not expect much more than that. Gamplay:The gamepaly is split up into 3 diffrent games, where one acts as the main game, while the others are mini-games. The main game is very simple, match coloured blocks in a chain, in order to make sand dissaper. When the sand is gone, the water you need to get to the end of the stage can continue to flow. After you let the water flow to the end, you win the level.The levels have diffrent obsticles along the way that can block the way to completion, these items is for eksample rocks. The levels are getting harder along the way, but you also unlock power-ups, that will help you to remove opsticles and reach the goal. The power-ups fells really overpowered, and can easily make the game a win for you, nearly every single time. This was a huge letdown for me, since I never really felt challenged. The powerups can be things like changing around blocks and blowing up paths. The two mini games are done, in order to unlock new levels. The first one is a ""spot the diffrence"" game, where you click a place on a picture, to spot the flaw on the other picture. The other part is a ""find the objects"" game, where you must spot things hidding in the background. All the games are controlled by simple mouse-clicking., and it fells rather slow and boring now and again. The overall games are not boring as such, but it quikly get`s repetative.Charecters:Well there are only two charecters in this game, and they both have no persanality. This game is clearly not story driven, but in my opinion, they did not need to include these charecters to complete a already unnesesary story. The charecters are a wizard, which we never see after the starting scren, and a fariy which guides you throughout the game. There is not much to say to this part, so let`s move on.Visuels:The game looks kinda ok, but I really did not exspect anything brillaint to be honest. The overall visuesl in-game are accually pretty fluid, and looks fine. But when you do anything outside the main game, the grafics fells weaker and more bluery. It`s hard to explain, but I felt there was something off.Sound:The music is acually ok in this game. I fellt it was a nice thing to include, and the diffrent themes are acually not that bad. Other then that, there are not much to say to the sounds other than the start theme will blast your speakers out, it is so loud!Story:So the story is pretty basic as said, clear all levels to controle all elements. The boring part is that the sory really has no twists and turns, instead it fells like it only is there to give you a reason to why there is 4 main levels. The other mini-games really has some cool story. Not so much the hidden object part. But when you complete the spot the diffrence game. You see the real picture, and get`s the lore of the charecter on it. This was some intresting reading, and felt like a nice inclusion to the game, and the lore of the establist world. But this is also where I don't really understand why they would create so mutch lore to a matching game. it feels really unessesary. Conclusion:The game is far from a masterpice, and it really is just another time killer game. This dose not mean I dislike the game at all, I am just saying you can find better games of this type out there. I completed the story and it really is just a congratiolation screen and nothing more. But if you are looking for a simple game to sit down and play, this one could be a nice choice.			",477,148,8,54,46,9,70

												A good match 3 game where you have to actively match them with mouse click. There is also a find the differences mini game along with some hidden object elements in it. While you match the elements there are also 4 different powerups which are useful to complete each level faster. Main goal in match 3 mode is to transport a green liquid until it reaches a tree that grows and shows that you have finished the level. Each level is designed very different and makes the game more challenging and gives it variety.The only compliant with this game i have is the unskippable sequences between levels. I can see such comfortable features were not common in these type of games back in 2008 and there are much better games released based of comfort function. If you are not patient gamer i wouldnt recommend this game. If you want to enjoy a different type of match 3 game i can recommend this for you.			",480,92,15,23,25,2,28

												This is a very tepid recommendation. The part of the game where you get to actually play isn't bad. It's extremely simple, probably intended for young children, but it's reasonably enjoyable. If it were only for this, my recommendation would be more enthusiastic. But the game is dragged down by a boring, cliché, contrived ""story"" that's duct taped around the game and adds absolutely no value to it, nor does it have any bearing on the game itself. In the aggregate, the game still tips the scales on the positive side, but just barely. I would recommend waiting for a hefty rebate or grabbing it as part of a bundle, if that ever happens.

												She is like a pretzel with too much salt. NO she was like meat lovers pizza with only one bite of meat.  when I started her up she came at me with the typical array of weapons most puzzle games that boast to have a story tend to do.  She had the expicit fantasy theme, the boistrous all of nothing music, the cute but elborate graphical fairies, buttons, whizzles and whigets.  but I blew past all that because I have done it so many times before.  I have kinda given up on the hope of any puzzle game  incorporating a story as an intregral inseperable part of the puzzle itself.  so I get the baby started.  I was pleased with initial premise of her.  She introduced herself with one face, then switched character to another, rode that one out for a spell, then once again another somersault face-change.  needless to say I was pleased.  I like surprises. eventually I came to understand that former and latter faces were mere attempts to keep things fresh, a little sugar to compliment her salty meat, her middle face.  and I appreciate that.  shows that she really cares about (me).

The ""story"" part is absolutely useless and despite I beat the game I have no idea what was going on with the story. The card and keys minigames are boring but also easy and short so it doesn't really matter. The game itself is challenging and fun as hell.

												TL;DR: This game is the definition of shovelware-made-for-mobile-hidden-object-game trash. And if youre looking for a Match-3 RPG DO NOT look here!Ok, so the tags are misleading. This is mostly a fantasy themed HOG (Hidden Object game), not a match 3 RPG like Puzzle Quest.  It has a tiny ""match 3"" component, if you can call it that. Basically, youre trying to draw a path from a start point to a finish point by breaking the ""rock"" by linking gems, which breaks the background ""rock"" and creates an open path. You select gems by dragging over them with a mouse. In any direction, including turning while dragging. Its so easy it isnt even funny. It goes HOG scene, where you have to find the pieces of various items in a picture, then use the items in the picture to open more scenes (IE a pickaxe to break a cave in). That gets you a key to open a book.Then a few rounds of the aforementioned match 3. THEN a ""find the differences between two images"" HOG. You do that a few times in each book before going back to the ""find pieces of items HOG"" to get the new key to open a new book.Theres no choice, no choosing of puzzles, and a very weak fantasy plot with an annoying fairy that constantly flits around the screen. Its like its badly built for 5 year olds. If you like HOGs (oh god, why??) theres WAY better ones out there. And if you like Match 3 RPGs theres way way better ones. This MAY entertain a 6 year old. But I doubt it. Do yourself a favor and dont waste your cash. ",211,106,1,118,39,0,27

												Casual match 3 game where you make chains of gems rather than swapping them. There's apparently a time limit for each level, but I only found this out because I left the game open while I went to make dinner, it gives you plenty of time per level. Infinite lives, there's powerups and soothing electronic pan flute music. Nice relaxing way to unwind.			",177,102,2,5,10,1,22

												This is not an exceptionally long game. You can beat it and earn all the achievements in rather short order (my play time includes needing to start over again roughly halfway through due to computer issues). Yet, it's well worth getting on sale. Basically, it's a match-three game in which you attempt to create a path for yourself through each level, using power-ups to assist you as needed. Longer chain matches lead to ever bigger explosions, making your work easier and faster. There are some fun twists to some of the levels, each world has its own feel to it, and it really is rather relaxing. To be honest, there were very few levels in the game that I was not able to beat the first time without running out of time, and none that took me more than two tries, so the degree of challenge might not be quite enough for some, but I view it as a positive. While beating the game is faster that way, it is also rendered largely free of the frustration that comes with countless deaths on the same level. Overall, if you like casual/match 3 games at all, then this is one to check out.It does seem fair to warn you of some negatives before you do so though. First, and most annoying, while there are hidden object and spot the difference style mini-games that you play at regular intervals to advance further in the game, the images are in rather low resolution, making what you're meant to spot rather difficult to see much of the time. Fortunately, there's a hint feature and no time limit, nor is there any penalty for random clicking, so when you can't see something these levels are still easily beatable. Also, as a fairly unimportant negative to the game, all the story elements that go along with the gameplay are not exactly going to fill you with excitement, if you care about such things in this kind of game. At least you'll now be a bit aware of what to expect though.			",1002,431,36,135,117,11,185

												4 Elements is a match 3+ game that captures the fun and unique essence that is generally missing in all the bejeweled clones. It isn’t as genius as any of Popcap’s creations but it does have a place on the list of casual games worth playing; especially if you are in to the Match 3+ type games. The game plays pretty much like any other match 3 games, except with quite few more additional twist. You can directly chain multiple gems together to create larger explosions to clear paths to reach the end goal while at the same time build up magical energies that match the colored gems destroyed. These magical energies unlock powers that include re-randomization of the game board, defrost/destroy gems, etc. In addition to the already huge amount of game changing twist, at the end of each book chapter you have to undergo a spot the difference and hidden object challenge. The story, while very limited in scope, is a nice touch and it adds on to the overall theme of the game.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												A pleasant surprise. It's a mix of several puzzle games. You first start off pixel-hunting for broken items (point and click). After that, you have to match blocks (match 3+) in order to create a stream of 'water/life'. You have to guide the stream to the tree and let it bloom (the game will also let you use power-ups every now and then). After several levels you'll unlock a picture. The game will then have you search for several differences between two seemingly identical pictures (search the difference). It's all stuff I love (though the match 3+ concept has been done to death these days)I expected only another match 3+ clone and was glad that it had more than just that. So, all in all, a recommendation.[Rating: 76/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Don't buy this, not even for a low-key relaxing game. It's no fun. There is no challenge, not even a relaxing one, at all. There's more or less no point at all to seek out the longest chains or to coordinate what you're doing or anything like that. Even for a child it would be way to easy since you don't really have to think about what're you doing. Just click away a bit and it all solves it self more or less. Boring.

Summary:- 4 ""click on everything to find the hidden object pixels"" puzzles- 64 ""match same gem types to form a path"" levels- 16 ""find the pixel differences"" puzzles- nicely done graphics and animations- for the currently discounted 0.79c ... that's less than a cent per feature.Can't really go wrong there, and it kept me (and my 2yr old niece) entertained for a good number of hours. I'd say it's a good buy even at the regular price.A few points that could use improvement (perhaps in a v2):- No real replayability. Once you've solved level 64, and perhaps hunted down the missing achievements, there's no reason to fire up the game anymore.Suggestions: let the game keep track of your individual level solution times or scores, to add an incentive to replay for better scores. Additionally, the game really should offer a built-in way to replay specific previously completed levels. As it is now, if you like certain levels and wish to revisit them, the game forces you to play all previous levels first to get to the ones you actually wished to replay, or... you have to edit the savegame xml. Ugh.A slightly more ambitious suggestion: a level design or mod tool would extend the lifetime of this game considerably.- No graphics/resolution options. Well, there is exactly one: fullscreen y/n. Fullscreen appears to be fixed at 800x600 regardless of screen native size, and windowed it cannot be resized either. Trying to find the hidden pixels of a tiny 800x600 window on a full HD (or more!) screen becomes very tiring for the eyes.It really should not need to be said that graphics and resolution options are a must for PC games. - Very frequent, randomly timed freezing. The game very regularly -every few minutes on average, but sometimes several times a minute- freezes up while playing a level, and becomes completely unresponsive for 1-5 seconds at a time. Very annoying!I haven't been able to figure out a pattern in this. Sometimes it seemed to happen when the cursor moved to/over the edge of the window. Other times it seemed timed with one of the animations onscreen. Browser, Steam client, notepad, task manager, Windows menu all respond fluently at the time the game freezes up, so it is very clearly just the game window. The only actual bug I've encountered, but it's an annoying one.End verdict: Annoyances aside, it's a good game for a good price if you like this sort of casual puzzles. Very kid friendly too (my 2yr old niece approves).			",478,92,40,78,110,1,135

												Even though I am not recommending this game, I did enjoy it. For me, there are two big flaws; the tediousness of the game and the sharp curve in the puzzles. First, the game is very tedious. The puzzles follow a similar pattern (4 puzzles to solve a level, 4 levels to a world, then one world puzzle). This in itself is not a huge issue as you want puzzle games to be lengthy and have variety. However, the difficulty of the game provides no variety up until like the last couple of levels. I have to say that the last three levels are some of the most fun puzzles I've played in a while, but it ends up just being disappointed that it wasn't present anywhere else in the game.

This kind of game could easily be delivered over HTML with interface scaling and so on.While it's a good example of the genre, dated technical limitations make it difficult to recommend.

												With a cool looking linear playthrough, at first glance there's nothing wrong with 4 Elements apart from the fact that full screen on a 1920x1080 monitor is streched with no further display options. I had to play it that small windowed mode with the monitor closer to my face. This, I can take, but already fills up the dislike bar a little bit. Other details made the rest of the work and the bar resulted in this review. The game itself is fine although a little bit repetitive and not very innovative. If you like lighly washed-on themes of fantasy and match-3 type games, no problem so far. But let's go to the list of annoyances:- There's one chance to shut the fairy up, when she asks if you want to keep receiving tips and stuff. If you don't shut her at that moment, you'll be stuck with her to the end of the game. The ""hints"" option only refers to the in-game matches, apparently.- You cannot choose what book you want to unlock next and there's no thematic justification for that, it is just ""later books, harder levels"". At least let us pick what card from a book to recover next or something, that would be easy to implement even keeping the levels linear but only changing their name, to present players with a ""false choice"". Everything is so linear that even this kind of insignificant choice would be cool to have. - You cannot replay any levels after they're beaten once. W-what?? That is a pain, because there are achievements that require you to start a whole new game if you don't get them at first. - The Epilogue took so long to appear that I have already clicked the screen thinking nothing would happen if I didn't. It skipped the ending and guess what? Once gone, you cannot access it anymore. In fact, forget your progress. At the time that screen appears, your progress is deleted and the only option is to start a new game. I hope there's a youtube video or something so I can see what the hell the Epilogue was about.The smaller the game, the heavier these details become. Overall, I don't recommend 4 Elements. Even without all the annoyance, it's still a repetitive and very forgettable game.			",106,58,14,9,10,3,50

Fortunately, it happens to be much much more than that.4 Elements is an addictive puzzler with beautifully illustrated scenes and an incredible musical score. Although the game can get a little repetative after a while (much of the game is drawing paths to move energy from one place to another), it keeps it difficult enough and paces itself well enough to keep you on your toes. The hidden-object parts feature very well illustrated scenes and are placed at different times throughout the game so that finding the objects don't feel like a chore. The game is also long enough that you will get your money's worth.Overall 8/10. It's a great game, lots of fun to be had.			",267,130,4,71,40,5,43

												It's a good game. It's quite easy so it's one of those games where you can sit back and relax. Starts off with a hidden object game where you have to use the items you've found (each one has pieces) to help find pieces of the other items. After that you have a connect the same colored gems game, then after that it's a spot the difference puzzle. A few different things to change it up all the time so it doesn't get boring.

												Great puzzle game that as a bonus contains magic and faeries!  Save the land of mythical wonder from tragedy by solving the puzzles, no worries if you get stuck the faerie can offer you a hint to guide adventurers on their way using magic!  Voice acting is good and the game is fun.  Cant get stuck with the hint button, and only encountered 2 puzzles that could be a bit iffy during a nonstsop powerrun of the game since its so addictive and fun being filled with magic and faeries.  Did you miss the part about the faeries and magic?   Because this game has faeries and magic!Rating:  10/10  Value:  9.99			",2655,1121,101,267,367,29,398

												4 Elements, as so many games centered around matching 3 or more same-colored stones, is a rather short and pretty much straightforward game. After every four levels, you'll get to play a short game of ""Spot the difference"", but that's pretty much all the excitement happening. Oh, and you get to search for objects before you open up another part of the game.The plot of restoring four books of magic, so that the powers within are in balance again, are a nice little touch, but pretty much all there is to it. After 64 levels, the game is played through completely, and you have the choice of starting all over again. (I played the first 16 levels again to gain the last two achievements, but that's it - I'm done with this game.)Overall, I wouldn't recommend the game unless you are really a match 3 fan, and find it funny to have a fairy at your side making you think of Navi. Granted, the fairy in this game is not as obnoxious, but not as helpful as Navi either. And that is a feat.Done with the game, moving on to something more entertaining - at least I hope the next one will be more entertaining.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Match 3 game with a few short hidden object and spot the difference scenes thrown in. Nice relaxing gameplay, but repetitive level design. All the different special blocks and powerups are introduced in the first few levels, and don't change throughout the rest of the game. In a game titled ""4 Elements,"" I'd expect some gameplay variations based on each element for the different stages, but instead there's just some minor aesthetic changes. As another reviewer mentioned, there's a sudden difficulty spike in the last two levels where the level design finally starts to get interesting, but it's far too late in the game.But it was enjoyable enough that I played the whole thing, and it's maybe worth checking out if you're bored with Bejewled or whatever.

												Sad to say the game is fun but relies on luck way to much instead of skill be prepared to restart games a lot more then should be NECESSARY. The power ups are woefully slow to load back up and some of the time your just going to lose because you have to wait for a power up to recharge. Now games do have some luck involved of course but when it becomes a game mechanic instead of skill then we have some issues with it.Mostly a game of luck rather then a game of skill really. ALso the dumb idea to add a timer is stupid and dumb and a little cruel to people who pay for this. Why does this need a timer at all??? It doesnt. . Also the price is way to high for this game bought it on sale for a buck. Im really not liking this game as much as I thought I would. Rather hard later on and gets on my nerves with just luck ruling the day in this game.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												It's not a bad game. I picked this up in a bundle, so for the price it couldn't be beat. I really think that they should cut the regular price in half on Steam, however, because of certain elements of the game. It's in a very low resolution, which stretches to the size of the resolution you have set on your monitor. At least from what I saw, there's no way to change this. A bad soundtrack is always my main complaint with games, but that's easily fixed with this game by just turning it off and putting on your own music - as I've stated in reviews for other games. 10 hours is about the maximum amount of time you'll get out of this game by the time you complete it. That isn't entirely a bad thing. It combines several different types of casual games. Click'n'find, image matching, and matching up crystals which give you some useful powers. Interesting, and not a bad game, just not amazing, either. Even for 2008 and a casual game, it could've been better. However, it did soak up 10 hours of my time and for that, it's definitely worth it for you to check it out next time it pops up in a bundle. 6.5/10 - Fun factor is huge, everything else is just okay.

												For people who are into jewel match puzzle games it can be addicting. I made it about an hour and was bored out of my ♥♥♥♥ing mind. All I could think of was how there are so many ways in life for my time to be more well spent, whether with other, much better games, or anything outside of games in real life. It is just a series of still pictures that you find items then point-and-click then a bunch of uninteresting, unfun, bleak, bland, boring jewel matching. For a decent jewel matching game play Bejeweled 3, not this snorefest. SNORE ZZzzZzZZZzzZZZ...			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Excellent game. Cleverly made, beautifully drawn; even the story has a good bit of charm if not originality.  While it is not the type of game that will keep you up at night or blow your mind (to be fair, few casual games are!), you may well find yourself staying up to play just one more level... again, and again, and again.   I highly recommend this game to people (who deal) with children. Especially if you want to introduce said children to the wonderful world of fantasy and fairy tells. This could be the first step, followed by Trine and then the Elder Scrolls :))) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game incorporates both those elements , by switching the levels from block bashing to point and find ever so often. Nearly three hours of playtime have been had on this game and my wife hasnt played a single minute , for i have hogged this game for it is so addictive to chain massive combos.

												I am going to lightly recommend this mostly because it is obvious that a tremendous amount of care went into this game.  The game is a variation on the match 3 genre. There is some nice variety between the four elements but the last two (wind and water) are obviously the most polished.  There are some really nice backgrounds with some animation (like fish swimming in some of the water levels).  The story is minimal but nice although the ending is really anticlimactic.  SPOILER   The intro has voiceover and more than one image but the ending is only a static image and some scrolling text.    After each four levels is a spot the difference game and once for each element there is a hidden object game.  You cannot revisit levels you have already played without starting a new game because there is only the linear story.  Also disappointing is the fact that you cannot scroll around a level and some of the action will happen offscreen at times.  In summary, this is a casual game in the match 3 genre with some nice polish that slightly outweighs its faults.			",2216,988,68,262,219,23,308

												4 Elements is a nicely executed match-3 game . The game has 3 types of levels - a kind of match 3 level, a find hidden objects level and a find the differences between 2 images level. The theme (plot) of the game is to restore the 4 elemental books. The way to do so is to first unlock the elemental book by playing a 'find hidden object' level. Then you have to unlock 4 cards for each elemental book. To unlock each card, you need to complete 4 objective based match 3 levels followed by a 'find the differences' level. There are 4 books - in total so 4 'find hidden object' levels. There are 4 cards per book so 64 (4x4x4) match 3 levels and 16 (4x4) 'find the differences' levels. So, although the game officially just tracks 64 levels, in total there are 84. The match 3 levels have a maze like design. You start at one point and need to reach another point within allocated time. There are 4 power ups which help you on the way. These power ups charge as you match more of the same colored gems. This is a good game to play when waiting for matchmade/MOBA games.			",1166,452,41,171,110,12,170

												I'll start with the few bad points: This game can only run in 4:3, which, as an Ultrawide user, means that I can literally do my maths homework in the black space on either side when running fullscreen. Also, no 4:3 resolution has a 1080-pixel height so everything looks aliased because you have to enlarge the textures (again, in fullscreen). The music is rather repetitive. The fairy is as annoying as the one in Zelda. And, I don't like the few non-match 3 elements.Now, the flip side of those: First, while the game does only run in 4:3, It looks good in 4:3. If you play this in a window, the textures and such look really really good. The music, though repetitive, is very good. If I could buy the soundtrack to this game, I would. The fairy can be made slightly less annoying by turning off her 'new item' tips. And, while I don't like hidden object and point-and-click games, this game integrates them very well and they are few, short, and far between.And finally, the good: This is one of the best match-3 games I've ever played. The animations are amazing, the mechanics work very well, the auto-panning camera works very well, there is a good story (not much of one, but still), and it's not too hard. Oh and on my system (4.5GHz 4690k, 2 1450MHz 970s, 16GB 2133MHz RAM, running off two HDDs in RAID0) it runs at around 4,000 fps, which is nice.			",352,89,22,50,56,2,56

												I really liked this game... on my first playthrough.Puzzles include 4 FROG (fractured object) screens, 16 spot-the-difference screens, and 64 match-3 levels.  The main match-3 levels are different from any other genre game I have played.  I was expecting a classic Bejeweled-style game, but instead of swapping tiles or sliding rows, you form chains by clicking and dragging a path through adjacent matching symbols.  The paths do not have to form a straight line, you can zig-zag any direction except diagonally (for all the explanation the game gives, they never actually tell you this).  As the game progresses, you will encounter obstacles such as ice, immovable blocks, narrow passages, and rocks; however, you will also gain access to rechargeable tools that help you overcome these obstacles.  There is a timer, but chances are you will not need to worry about it until 3/4 of the way through the game, and even if you fail you just restart the level with no penalties.  The levels are increasingly challenging, but never frustrating or boring.  In fact, I found I enjoyed the later levels more because they forced you to use a bit of strategy to complete.  I thought it was a nice touch that each of the four elements have a slightly different level aesthetic, which helps keep the levels feeling fresh.As great as the gameplay was, though, there are things that destroy the replay value:- The story is cheesy.  Although, that's to be expected for this genre.- The chatty fairy.  She was fine for the first playthrough, providing necessary instructions and tips to help you learn and understand the game.  Subsequent playthroughs, though, are a different story - her dialogue cannot be skipped or turned off, so you will have to suffer through ""Pop-Ups: The Game"" every single time.  This is annoying if you just want to sit down and replay a few levels casually.- There is no option to select your starting level.  Whether you want to challenge yourself by replaying a tricky stage, or whether you are just trying to go for a specific achievement, your only choices are to continue from your last autosave or to completely start over.  Again, this is fine for the first playthrough, but an unlockable freeplay mode would have been appreciated.- The achievements are a bear to get.  It took me 1.5 playthroughs to get ""Overachiever"" because it is partially luck-dependent, and ""Quick as a Flash"" took 11 angry hours: The first FROG screen does not count toward the achievement because the fairy's dialogue and tutorial eat up so much of your time, so you are left with only three chances per game to earn it (the FROGs for the fire key, the air key, and the water key).  Basically, this means you will need to play through 16 match-3 levels and 4 spot-the-difference puzzles before you even reach the first applicable fractured object screen, and you will be continuously forced to deal with the fairy's ""helpfulness.""  If you miss the 90-second timeframe on the fire key puzzle, there is no way to just try it again because the game autosaves just AFTER you complete it.  You will either need to restart the game, or hope that you have better luck with the air key.  Regardless, you are looking at another 16 levels and 4 puzzles before getting a second opportunity to win this achievement.  If there had been either a freeplay mode, or a way to turn off the fairy, I might have given this game a 9.5/10 because the gameplay is solid, and it would have been incredibly replayable.  As is, though, I would have to give it a 6.5/10.			",25,124,0,16,6,0,8

												I have been unable to find a match 3 game to match this one so far. I love it. I hadn't tried match three before as I had been put off by tetrus style humdrum. This game you can try and make the longest trail you can and the fastest route to solve the puzzle. Its just refreshing. I am looking for another game like this one to a disapointing no avail so farI like the mix of 4 spot the differance and 4 very good HO too. It was the HO that brought me to this purchase which if that was all I wanted I would have been disapointed as there are only four although they are very good. ",56,99,0,19,16,0,11

Although puzzlers certainly aren't for everyone, and its difficulty isn't exactly chart-topping, I had a lot of fun playing through the game and adding magical creatures to my spell book. I wouldn't say this is a must-buy, but if you're looking for a fun, yet simple puzzle game to pass the time while in class or on the bus or something, I'd say to go for it.			",201,57,0,93,21,0,52

												I am going to lightly recommend this mostly because it is obvious that a tremendous amount of care went into this game.  The game is a variation on the match 3 genre. There is some nice variety between the four elements but the last two (wind and water) are obviously the most polished.  There are some really nice backgrounds with some animation (like fish swimming in some of the water levels).  The story is minimal but nice although the ending is really anticlimactic.  SPOILER   The intro has voiceover and more than one image but the ending is only a static image and some scrolling text.    After each four levels is a spot the difference game and once for each element there is a hidden object game.  You cannot revisit levels you have already played without starting a new game because there is only the linear story.  Also disappointing is the fact that you cannot scroll around a level and some of the action will happen offscreen at times.  In summary, this is a casual game in the match 3 genre with some nice polish that slightly outweighs its faults.			",2216,988,68,262,219,23,308

												I really liked this game... on my first playthrough.Puzzles include 4 FROG (fractured object) screens, 16 spot-the-difference screens, and 64 match-3 levels.  The main match-3 levels are different from any other genre game I have played.  I was expecting a classic Bejeweled-style game, but instead of swapping tiles or sliding rows, you form chains by clicking and dragging a path through adjacent matching symbols.  The paths do not have to form a straight line, you can zig-zag any direction except diagonally (for all the explanation the game gives, they never actually tell you this).  As the game progresses, you will encounter obstacles such as ice, immovable blocks, narrow passages, and rocks; however, you will also gain access to rechargeable tools that help you overcome these obstacles.  There is a timer, but chances are you will not need to worry about it until 3/4 of the way through the game, and even if you fail you just restart the level with no penalties.  The levels are increasingly challenging, but never frustrating or boring.  In fact, I found I enjoyed the later levels more because they forced you to use a bit of strategy to complete.  I thought it was a nice touch that each of the four elements have a slightly different level aesthetic, which helps keep the levels feeling fresh.As great as the gameplay was, though, there are things that destroy the replay value:- The story is cheesy.  Although, that's to be expected for this genre.- The chatty fairy.  She was fine for the first playthrough, providing necessary instructions and tips to help you learn and understand the game.  Subsequent playthroughs, though, are a different story - her dialogue cannot be skipped or turned off, so you will have to suffer through ""Pop-Ups: The Game"" every single time.  This is annoying if you just want to sit down and replay a few levels casually.- There is no option to select your starting level.  Whether you want to challenge yourself by replaying a tricky stage, or whether you are just trying to go for a specific achievement, your only choices are to continue from your last autosave or to completely start over.  Again, this is fine for the first playthrough, but an unlockable freeplay mode would have been appreciated.- The achievements are a bear to get.  It took me 1.5 playthroughs to get ""Overachiever"" because it is partially luck-dependent, and ""Quick as a Flash"" took 11 angry hours: The first FROG screen does not count toward the achievement because the fairy's dialogue and tutorial eat up so much of your time, so you are left with only three chances per game to earn it (the FROGs for the fire key, the air key, and the water key).  Basically, this means you will need to play through 16 match-3 levels and 4 spot-the-difference puzzles before you even reach the first applicable fractured object screen, and you will be continuously forced to deal with the fairy's ""helpfulness.""  If you miss the 90-second timeframe on the fire key puzzle, there is no way to just try it again because the game autosaves just AFTER you complete it.  You will either need to restart the game, or hope that you have better luck with the air key.  Regardless, you are looking at another 16 levels and 4 puzzles before getting a second opportunity to win this achievement.  If there had been either a freeplay mode, or a way to turn off the fairy, I might have given this game a 9.5/10 because the gameplay is solid, and it would have been incredibly replayable.  As is, though, I would have to give it a 6.5/10.			",25,124,0,16,6,0,8

												This game is nothing more than a ""Hidden Object"" game with some ""Bejeweled"" thrown in.  It wastes a lot of your time with pointless dialogue and ""extra content"" that isn't even good in terms of story.  This game is annoying throughout with many agitating features and problems that would cause even children to become frustrated or bored... so, who's this game aimed at?  Not sure.

												I'm beginning to agree with all the Steam reviewers who think we need to have a ""neutral"" button for reviews. While I enjoyed my time with 4 Elements, I can't *strongly* recommend it, but if you like match-3 type games and find it on sale (I got it while it was only 99 cents), then there are probably worse ways to spend your time and money. The game also features Hidden Object and Find the Differences scenes, but the (very) main focus are the match-3 puzzle scenes in which you clear a path for a flow of energy to make it to a goal by chaining together three or more objects of the same color in a row. The more objects you chain up, the bigger an explosion it makes, causing the energy to flow farther. It's kinda fun and addicting, especially to scout the screen for the largest possible chain to make and to watch the ensuing chaos as it explodes and takes out the surroundings, sometimes even setting off arrows that travel across the screen and blow away even more crap.The game is long, but rather easy. The last few levels introduce some new gimmicks that make them harder, such as one where the screen auto-scrolls and you have to manically keep forming chains so that the energy flow keeps up with it. But it seems like more of this kind of thing was needed. I know, welcome to Casual Gaming, right? While I replayed the game just enough to get the achievements, I wouldn't want to go all the way through it again right away because it can get monotonous.Finally, the richness of the story is a bit overstated in this game's description. Mostly it's in the form of cards you get after doing the ""find the differences"" scenes, which have a picture of a fantasy animal, knight, or humanoid race on it with a description of them. The hand-drawn graphics are beautiful, but the style sometimes makes it difficult to tell where the differences are or the hidden objects are.In short, if you like this type of game and it's on sale, go for it. If not, it's a safe skip.Rating: 3/5			",344,258,7,60,12,0,38

												I played the free version of this game years ago and the pay version is worth it.  For a puzzle game you need to be able to replay it over and over.  4 Elements has that ability minus the find the objects part.  Being able to skip that after you've beaten the game would be nice.

												TL;DR: Small puzzle game. If you like bejewelled, and similar games, you will like this one. Low graphical fidelity.I would recommend this game to players who like puzzle games. This one is short and can feel a bit repetetive, but well, that is sort of the point of most puzzle games. You sit down, do a stage or two and then move on with your life.One big drawback is the low graphical fidelity of the game.			",834,365,28,131,151,11,206

												This is a good casual, puzzle solving game. I would recommend if you like games such as Bejeweled.~ Good ~Graphics: The artwork for each of the cards you unlock are all well drawn.Soundtrack:I enjoyed the music throughout the game. It fits with the fantasy theme throughout the game. Gameplay:The main puzzle game is quite addicting. You break blocks to guide some fluid to the end of the stage, reaching some fountain. You have several powerups along the way. The longer a chain you make, the more blocks will break at the end.~ Bad ~Difficulty:Or rather the lack of. The game is quite easy throughout the whole game. It boils down mostly to luck whether you get stuck or not. The only real difficulty I found in the game was during the ""spot the difference"" game. There are at least 50 different stages, but they mostly felt longer rather than more difficult.			",172,366,6,57,34,3,40

												4 Elements is a casual puzzle game with a whimsical theme and clever gameplay mechanics. Although puzzlers certainly aren't for everyone, and its difficulty isn't exactly chart-topping, I had a lot of fun playing through the game and adding magical creatures to my spell book. I wouldn't say this is a must-buy, but if you're looking for a fun, yet simple puzzle game to pass the time while in class or on the bus or something, I'd say to go for it.			",201,57,0,93,21,0,52

												This game is a great way to while away a couple of hours. You can quit and save progress after every level. It's simple to learn, is easy pick-up and play, and you can buy it pretty cheap too. Fun match three (or more) with some unique 'items' (spades, bombs etc) and different block types. Not bad at all.			",260,75,7,40,20,1,45

												Forcing myself to finish this game was almost beyond my abilities. It gets boring very quickly. The four powers are useless to start, but later levels force you to grind them to pass some areas. The little sequence at the end of each level is unskippable while the words are being unscrambld, it only takes a few seconds, but you will come to dread them. I play windowed and had hoped I could tab to my browser to avoid it, but the game takes the liberty of pausing itself whenever it isn't the active window.I can't say much about the story, as I skipped all he dialogue.

												4 Elements is a great, short causal game. Of course this game is basically 3 match with a added story. The story is basically pointless because you just follow the matching madness. The acheivements are easy to get and the game itself is not complecated. Why would I recommend it?
