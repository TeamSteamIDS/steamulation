It isn’t a game, it’s an experience.A lot of the criticism and confusion of Dear Esther is brought about because it is not exactly 'a game'. There are no enemies, no objectives, no inventory, nothing we've come to expect in video games. It is where art, storytelling and games intersect, to create a masterpiece.

Dear Esther is visually astounding. Journey deep into the island's caves and you will be utterly in awe of the beauty therein.

The music is beautifully haunting, always appropriate in intensity for the situation, and never overwhelming it.The narration contributes significantly to the player's emotional state while traversing the island. His rantings and musings, his rage and his despair, all help lend color to the landscape, and keep the player firmly rooted in the world before them. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532172608Whether you would define Dear Esther as a game or not, if you have any interest in narrative driven adventure games, you’re sure to find a new favorite here and it is without a doubt an experience you will not regret.

												Well there's something you don't see everyday - Dr. Peter Venkman, GhostbustersTHE GOODDear Esther is not your ordinary game. In some respects, it is not a game at all. Focusing on environments and atmosphere rather than gameplay and action is a nice way to change the pace, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who prefers Serious Sam and Doom over Amnesia and Proteus, I do not think this game is for you. The sound in the game is, well, not very exciting overall. The intro plops you into the island with explanation of why you are there, if you pay attention. The story is told by a nameless narrator, who talks about the island, his hobbies, and the mysterious Esther. Digging deeper into the story explains more about the characters and the settings, but only if you are willing to look.THE GREATThe game can be frightening and intense if you let it. Beautiful environments are accompanied by the haunting yet calming voice of the narrator, who tells his life to you. While not the best decision for gameplay, Dear Esther provides with an amazing narrative and an atmosphere that is so thick you could wrap yourself up in it. The first chapter is the make or break point in this game.While not looking very stunning, the first part does do its job to set up the second half of the game. Not giving away too much, but not boring you to the point of no return. The end of the second chapter is where it is its best. The aesthetic changes completely, music greets you immediately, and the haunting feeling kicks in. The third chapter is my personal favourite, with the climax of the game leaving you able to interpret it however you please.THE UGLYThere is no gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted gameplay, they could've at least given you the choice to turn off and on your flashlight, or maybe do some simple puzzle. Face the facts: You walk extremely slow. Perhaps for pacing, but it can be frustrating whil you spend the whole damn game going 10mph (That's metres, not miles). Also, for a game about discovery, there is very little to discover, not that you'd feel inclined to due the the speed of your walking. It can be quite boring if you're playing it after watching a walkthrough of it on Youtube, TwitchTV, or whatever place you use to watch gameplay videos, so I'd recommend not watching gameplay of Dear Esther before playing it. Also the visuals of Dear Esther deteriorates when it is put into videos, no matter how you set the graphical quality (1080p does NOT do this game justice via video).THE VERDICTThere are two types of people in the world. Type one is the type who prefer Proteus over Dear Esther, and the other type of people prefer Dear Esther over Proteus. I fall into the latter category, for many reasons. If in doubt, get it on a sale. If you like it, great news! If you don't, you spent $5 and 1.4GB 'playing' a game that you didn't like. Personally, I think that the third chapter is the best chapter in this game. For the first two chapters, you explore the island, and at the end of the second chapter, a forced plot point happens which sends you to the most beautiful part of this game. The final chapter wraps it up nicely, and some people will like the final chapter more, so suffice to say the second half f the game is generally liked more. Also, this is NOT a game for children. It can be difficult to understand and there are so many plot elements that are metaphors or relatively unusual. SIMILAR GAMES-Proteus, in many ways, but also differs greatly-Amnesia: The Dark Descent, although without being as scaryFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview ",231,49,0,8,8,3,16

												Dear Esther is beautifully designed, hauntingly atmospheric and splendidly narrated. It also has a couple of very big problems...<Contains minor spoilers> The Old Argument ...but funnily enough, the question of whether or not Dear Esther is a game isn't one that bothers me. Gaming is still a relatively young medium, and writing off a game just because it doesn't meet the traditional definition can only stifle innovation and discourage others from experimenting. Ultimately, I'm more interested in the question: did Dear Esther succeed in what it set out to do? Well, allow me to elaborate on what I think. Hebrides Dear Esther is a so-called ""walking simulator"" (i.e. has very little gameplay besides walking and looking) set on a bleak Hebridian island. This island is perhaps the most compelling character in the entire story: it is nothing short of breathtaking. I regularly visit these islands in real life, and Dear Esther succeeds magnificently in capturing their bleak magnificence. Coastal winds whistle through rusted chain-link fences, smoky clouds hug towering cliffs, bothies speckle the terrain and rocky bays with rotten wooden structures dominate the landscape. Both the visual (spinning 2D plants aside) and the sound design are spot-on in establishing the atmosphere, which in turn is helped by the superb soundtrack. There were some moments that left me literally stunned at what I was witnessing on my screen, that's a rare achievement for any video game.Anywho, you play as a nameless, voiceless, faceless protagonist shipwrecked on a harsh Scottish island, who must make their way towards the radio tower on the horizon. It's not really clear what you intend to do once you get there, but never mind. Interaction is limited to walking around the island and sometimes poking your head into forlorn buildings, only to find them empty and long-abandoned. The lion's share of the game is spent listening to a well-spoken narrator reading a series of letters written to the eponymous Esther. The narrator himself is another highlight of the game; speaking in a deliberately monotone voice to start with, but rising to passionate speeches as you approach the game's climax.So I like everything so far, and I don't mind the bare-bones gameplay, so why a No? Crux Because of the limited interactivity, the narration pretty much forms the crux of the entire experience. Sadly, I found the quality of the writing in Dear Esther to be wanting.If ever there was a walking definition of purple prose, this would be it. Although it contains a handful of reasonably well-written lines, the core parts of the narrative are so cluttered with flowery dialogue that it repeatedly draws attention to itself with how ridiculous it sounds. I admit to not being the smartest when it comes to analyzing good writing, but I can usually get invested in a well-told story even if I don't fully understand everything behind it. But Dear Esther is so full of itself and so utterly pretentious that I found myself getting frustrated rather than intrigued by the story. Here are a couple excerpts from the game:""An imagined answerphone message. The tires are flat, the wheel spins loosely, and the brake fluid has run like ink over this map, staining the landmarks and rendering the coastline mute, compromised. Where you saw galaxies, I only saw bruises, cut into the cliff by my lack of sobriety.""""I had kidney stones, and you visited me in the hospital. After the operation, when I was still half submerged in anesthetic, your outline and your speech both blurred. Now my stones have grown into an island and made their escape and you have been rendered opaque by the car of a drunk.""Perhaps my experience with human beings is limited, but this sounds like it was written by a teenager in English class trying to sound far cleverer than he actually is (this I can speak from experience though, because it sounds like one of my old essays). This is the only story I've experienced that somehow manages to be both frustratingly vague and tiresomely heavy-handed at the same time. Not sure how they did that, but that's the thought that kept crossing my mind as I listened to it. Amputation Then we come to the second problem: the player. The fact that Dear Esther may not be a 'real' game isn't what bothers me. What does bother me is that the player is completely amputated from the story being told. We're not here to partake in a moving tale of human loss, instead we're merely treated as a vehicle for the narrator to force flowery nonsense down our throats without getting to experience or even influence any of it. In fact, we're almost a hindrance to the game for our mere presence. This makes me wonder why Dear Esther is even a game in the first place, especially since it wrestles control from you during the ending (the only time something of note actually happens). The only benefit from it being a game is that I get to hold down W for 90 minutes, so it's essentially like watching a film on a DVD player with a broken pause button. On top of that, the walking speed is painfully slow:""People need to be more patient and take their time with soaking in the atmosphere""This is what admirers of the game often tell me when I bring this up. Fair enough, I like immersing myself in a slow-burner, if anything I prefer a slower-paced story. But more often than not you'll wander down rather lengthy corridors, find nothing of interest, not even a bit of narration, and then have to slowly plod all the way back again. At this point, all the carefully planned pacing in the game comes to a crashing halt. Then there are other times when you have to traverse fairly featureless expanses all the while sliding along at the speed of a Peugeot driver on the Edinburgh bypass. This is not good pacing, this is just time wasting. Final... Some might say that I've simply missed the point of the game, and that I'm too thick or impatient to fully appreciate Dear Esther's strengths. In all honestly, there's a good chance that you're correct in saying that. However, this game did not engage me on any level. I never felt invested in any of the character shells we're given a vague description of, and its eagerness to be intellectual and thought-provoking just came across as pretentious and condescending. I can give it credit for trying, but not for failing in its primary purpose. For that reason, I cannot recommend Dear Esther as a video game.(But I do recommend buying the soundtrack. Seriously, go get it, it really is that good)For a less truncated review, see my blog piece below:http://indignationgaming.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/thoughts-on-dear-esther_42.html ",148,36,1,18,4,1,7

												As always, TL;DR at the bottom. This game deserves more though. In recent years it has become more common to hear gamers, and even some non-gamers giving credit to games as pieces of art. Truly all games are art in some form as they provide a visual and narrative experience no matter what type of game they are. Some games are simply greater classified as art than others, but even inside of that it seems something such as 'Dear Esther' should be given credit on the art scale much higher than any old ""video games are art"" scale. 'Dear Esther' is claimed by many as ""not a game"". This is a debate I am no longer interested in, as I simply don't take a hard stance on what a game is anymore now that I have played so many adventure games, and what are more aptly described as ""walking simulators"". If you want to call it art instead, which it is, I can accept that, but debating on what a game is has become something I do not find interesting anymore. It's a game to me and great art at the same time. Now that I have grown up a little and become able to appreciate games as great pieces of art, I look for games with beauty in narrative, visuals, music, and even atmosphere much more often than I once did. Giving games described as ""walking simulators"" a much greater chance than I once would have as a younger gamer. 'Dear Esther' is a game I never would have played maybe as recent as a year ago. I would ignore games such as this and mockingly call them ""walking simulators"", or games with a lot of FMVs like MGS4, ""movies"". It's actually quite embarrassing thinking about discussions I've had in the past about such games. >_>I'm glad I came to my senses because games like this not only give you a sense of extreme beauty, but challenge you to think about things in abstract and interesting ways. Digging into you deeper than a more traditional game focused solely on the gameplay, which I considered the ONLY thing that mattered for the longest time. Games with these weird worlds, stories, and characters just stick with you longer and allow for us to spend more time with them after finishing by discussing them with other gamers. Isn't that something we all enjoy as a major part of gaming? Discussing games and trying to understand them when they give us something to talk about? (feel free to discuss in the comments of this review! Please be mindful of spoilers, however.) It definitely does for me, and 'Dear Esther' made me think, wonder, and read more about it the second I was done playing. 'Dear Esther' on a technical side is a magnificently wonderful game. While you can see in the store screenshots that the game has haunting and lovely visuals, you can't really know how wonderful the atmosphere is without playing it. The music in this game is so well done (I highly recommend buying this soundtrack and I rarely do that) that I found myself saving when I heard a piece start so that I could reload and listen to it again before moving on. The music is atmospheric, haunting, beautiful, and I can't think of a game where I was so enthralled by the music before. With the musical score lending to the feel of the game, the island you find yourself on gives a tremendous feeling of isolation, dread, insanity, and fear. You will go into ""every nook and cranny, John"" to see the strange items and locations from all angles before moving down the correct path to move the narration along. Taking these extra paths may lead you to seeing extra narration, or even ghosts out of the corner of your eye. Making you feel like you might not be alone, and then dissipating into mist to leave you wondering if you had just seen something moving, or it was just your imagination. The narration voice-over is spectacular. A voice that helps the atmosphere as much as anything else, but what is said is just as unnerving in many instances. Narration comes at you as you walk around and move through the island on your ascent up to the top. It will be strange and probably not make a ton of sense every time you hear it. You will feel the mind of the narrator, which is you, seem to disjoint, and speak about things that don't seem relevant at times, but interesting none the less. Strangely, although I have played through the first couple chapters more than once, the narration seems to change in different playthroughs, making it almost impossible to know what exact pieces you will hear in a certain area. The theme and dialog seems to be standard enough through the entire game that the story you hear is about the same as it would be any other time, but it is quite interesting to hear other blurbs as you reach a section from game to game. I have no idea how many of these different blurbs you can encounter, but I am planning to play through the game again, maybe several times not just because I love the feel and isolation I feel while playing the game, but to tread deeper into the depths of the story and hear various new commentaries.If you read this far, this game is for you. If you are willing to take this much time to read a review, I think you can appreciate this wonderful game as the artistic piece of work that it deserves. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has accepted games as more than just gameplay, but as a form of true beauty, a place to lose yourself in a world without having to shoot at things and jump around, and challenge yourself to see what the creator is trying to say by making it less than easy for you to interpret their strange thoughts to us gamers. A like-minded gaming friend gifted me this game, and I am truly grateful that someone cared enough to share this experience with me. It was a wonderful journey. Thank you. :)TL;DR Glorious mix of graphics, music, narration, and atmosphere. Walking simulator that is a true masterwork of art in the gaming universe. Even if you don't respect games such as this, give it a try (Not sure there has been a game in more bundles than this one so there is no way you can't get this for cheap at some point. The forum has 75% off coupons being given away constantly right now as well so there is that too). and see if you can appreciate it for what it is rather than just disregarding this genre entirely without actually making an effort to understand why people DO like them. A challenging, insightful, chilling, isolationist walk through a place that could make you think, feel terror, and maybe, just maybe turn you into a fan of more than just games focused entirely on gameplay.

												This is a work of art.There is little story, and even less gameplay.  You're mostly railroaded along a path, where you will hear and see things.  The world is visually appealing, and the voice work is wonderful, but the overall mood may or may not appeal to you.Like any purely artistic work, it either speaks to you or it falls flat.  Personally, it's not my cup of tea, but it might be yours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As an English major, maybe I am biased. Maybe also I am biased by the facts that my fiance died 12 months ago, that my mother died several months after that, and that my father soon died after her. It has been a rough year. Maybe that's why I love this game, and why I already own about ~3-4 copies of it so far, due to Humble Bundles and whatnot...But perhaps not.I loved Dear Esther long before any of that stared, after all. I certainly played it at least more than 21 times, trying to figure out where its lines were, though I could never exactly locate them on my maps. I would try to explain it to my fiance, to my dad, to my mom, back when they were still alive, why a 'video game' meant so much to me. How stupid was that? Trying to explain why a 'video game' actually meant something? Instanity, right? Like a barnacle, clinging stupidly to a rock, just trying to not slide into the ocean.Or, perhaps, it is just that Dear Esther is really not a game, but rather a brilliant piece of existential human literature? Is that a real option? Really?Maybe this 'game' is as good as the hype, or at least maybe it is for those who are listening for its quiet themes and narratives. Maybe it captured something its 'haters' are deaf to.Ah, who cares...This is my all-time favourite video 'game', and I don't care if it's not really a game or not, or if scores of others don't understand/appreciate it and instead choose to pile heaps of scorn/mockery/ridicule on it for not fitting within the mold they've decided it needs to fit.This is, uquestionably, IMHO, the greatest video 'game' I've ever played, full-stop, even if there is no actual game to play. Dear Esther is a rare, precious gem of a 'game', and it makes me feel good just to have had the priveledge of experiencing it.			",97,39,0,12,29,4,25

												During the first 10 minutes or so of this game, while I was wandering (slowly) through the game's initial area, I was bored. Very, very bored.  While I was bored there was a pretentious British guy babbling to me in an overwrought poetic manner about something that had happened and for which I had no background information to help me understand what the hell he was talking about.  That changed (thankfully): the backstory filled in, the environment and audio changed, and things improved dramatically.  This game has very impressive visual and audio aesthetics.  The background sounds and ambient music enhance the experience significantly (you should play with headphones on).  The voice acting is also compelling--you can really feel the narrator's internal turmoil as he struggles with what has happened.  The world the developers built here has a sense of mystery, purpose and beauty, but also sadness, introspection, and the portent of dread.  As I progressed through the ""game"" I felt more and more anxious about the revelations to come from the narrator. The suspense was palpable, and was reflected in the narrator's increasingly impassioned and upset dialogue.  It's quite well done.  I would say this is a game targeted toward mature gamers, in the sense that it is pretty sophisticated overall.There are a few weak points: for a 1-hour experience it's quite a bit pricey at $10 (I got it on sale); the poetic tone was good but I thought it was forced in a few places, and at times obscured the backstory; the guy walks pretty slowly (you can go into console and change that, but that kinda breaks immersion).In retrospect, I was impatient at the beginning of the game and am very glad I pressed on.  This is a very worthwhile experience. I do think $10 is a bit steep, so I'd recommend waiting til it's on sale.  If you are really into artistic and experiential games, then this is definitely for you. on sale or not.  I recommend it.			",162,28,2,8,16,1,15

Dear Esther: Games as ArtUp till five years ago, discussions about games as a form of art, were largely considered as non-important. There was a more or less clear distinction between the ""higher"" arts, and the more ""commercial"" games, although many of those used elements from several arts (in-game music, often symphonic and with a classical feel to it, being just one example). With the rise of the Indie game-scene around 2010, things started to evolve fast. Since indie-developers are not bound by contracts to large (and indeed often very commercial) publishers, they found themselves in a position where experimenting with the medium of games itself turned into something viable.One of the almost immediate consequences of this huge shift in focus, was the rise of what many have called since then ""artistic games"": games as the newest form of art, following in the footsteps of literature, music, architecture, painting, sculpture, photography, cinematography and the likes. This idea has generated some debate during the last five years, but it's still an underrated aspect of gaming. The one game that really stands out as maybe thé flagship of the artistic games, would surely be Dear Esther. Released in February 2012 by the small indie-company The Chinese Room, it made a huge impact on the gaming scene by the radical way in which it changes the entire concept of what a computer game is all about.In this game there are no ""goals"" the player has to achieve, there is no such thing as ""winning or losing"", there is not even the possibility of playing well or badly, or of interacting with the environment. Actually, the gameplay is extremely limited: the player can only walk around on an abandoned island in the Scottish Hebrides in first-person view, with no running, jumping, climbing or crouching as in most first-person games. This immediately gives the game a very leisured pace, which may not be to the liking of everyone. Dear Esther has even been called a ""walking simulator"" - it's the most prominent of its tags on the Steam store at the moment. But it's nothing like that, in my opinion. Thsi game is not about the physical walk around the - extremely impressive and atmospheric - island. Dear Esther tells another kind of story: a story that happens within the main character, and one that is told with such emotional force that I as a player not only identified myself with the character, but also started to actually FEEL like he does. Now that's a rare experience in any game up till now: the feeling that the entire game, with all its components (visuals, story, music in this case) got under my skin in such a way that I got emotionally involved to a very, very large extent. I won't spoil anything from the story, but it's nothing light-weight to be sure and the game has stayed with me since I first played it three weeks ago.And there is not really much more to say about this amazing, almost genre-defining piece of art. Actually, the debate may not be if it's a piece of art (most will agree to that), but to whether it's a game or not. To my opinion, it's certainly both, and as such stands proud as one of the prime examples of artistic games that give as rich and rewarding an experience as reading a novel by Daphne du Maurier, looking at a painting by Turner or listening to a sonata by Mozart. But be advised: this gem calls for your complete attention, so headphones and a dark environment are recommended. Especially so since the soundscape the game provides, be it from the howling of the wind to the eerie, haunting music by Jessica Curry, deserves every inch of attention.Overall score: 9/10			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

												I really enjoyed Dear Esther. Whether it be the beautiful visuals, the powerful ambient music or the in-depth analysis into the human mind. Dear Esther has it all.I was perplexed upon reaching The Caves, it's truly stunning at what can be achieved within the parameters of the Source engine.I'd consider this as more of an artistic experience than a game. I found myself questioning so much during my playthrough and for that, I'm thankful for such a wonderful journey.			",3529,1348,142,352,517,49,522

												First off, let's be clear: this isn't a game for everybody. Nor is it really a 'game'. If you want fast paced action, turn back now, but if you're looking for something different, something a bit avant-garde and arty, Dear Esther is well worth your time.You play a nameless character (first-person) who wanders along a basically linear path accross an abandoned Hebridean island for about 2 hours while a narrator intermittently reads fragments of letters to a woman named Esther. Interaction is minimal: you can walk, look around, and zoom in slightly. A flashlight automatically turns on when you enter a dark place. That's it in terms of gameplay, but Dear Esther's focus is not gameplay, it's on story.And what a confusing story it is. Piecing together the narrative will require you to listen carefully to everything the narrator says, read past the symbolism and shifting characters, and to play the game a few times (the fragments are mixed semi-randomly each time you start the game, so you won't hear every fragment until you've played the game at least 4 times). On top of that, you'll have to look around for visual clues on the island: objects littered on the ground, books in houses, diagrams and messages painted on walls. Even then, you'll still have trouble figuring out everything exactly what happened. However, you'll be able to work out the bare bones of the story from one playthrough.As mentioned before, the story is primarily told through letters read out by a narrator who is the protagonist of the story. The writing is poetic, symbolic, and digressive, often making it difficult to follow, but this is intentional I believe. The writing is really excellent (although a little over-wrought at times), and is delivered fantastically by the voice actor. Without giving much away, the story concerns a tragic accident in the narrator's past, and explores themes of guilt and redemption. Its stunning conclusion nearly brought me to tears, and loses none of its power on replays.The visuals of Dear Esther are stunning, wonderfully complimenting the loneliness and sadness of the story. You get a real visual feast, from the rugged hills above ground to the etheral caves below. The music is also beautiful, and goes well with the visuals and story.By now, you know whether this game is for you or not. If you think it is, buy Dear Esther right now and get ready for the experience of a lieftime.			",124,30,0,16,16,2,34

												Published by: ThechineseroomDeveloped by: Thechineseroom & Robert Briscoe	Genre: Adventure/Walking SimulatorRelease Date: February 14, 2012Time to complete: 1.5 hoursIntroductionThis 'game' truly is an artistic masterpiece. Being a walking simulator, the aim is simple; you walk around an island, taking in it's beautiful surroundings. The protagonist of this 'game' is a man set on a journey across a seemingly abandoned island. As you walk, fragments of a letter sound, and you're left with questions, allowing your imagination to run rampant. Who is Esther, and why does this quiet island resonate such familiarity with our protagonist? Are the surroundings real, or imagined? Abandoned buildings, caves and shipwrecks, this island brings forth an eerie yet calming atmosphere, and the raw emotion is exemplified with the stunning atmospheric soundtrack.Graphics The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and there is no lack of stunning landscape and imagery throughout the hour and a half (give or take) of game play. However, to call it a game would be entirely misleading; Dear Esther is more of a immersive movie, taking you on a beautifully narrated story around a mysterious island. Verdict:As the graphics are generally a main focus in a walking simulator (being that there's no real 'game play'), it's super important that they get this right- which they did, perfectly. The only negative thing I could say on the visuals of this artistic masterpiece, is that it ended too soon. Score: 8/10Soundtrack The beautiful instrumental soundtrack, composed by the talented Jessica Curry specifically for this game, has a tranquil, soothing vibe that really adds to the feel of the story. Add to that the calming narration by Nigel Carrington, and you're set to go on a relaxing and encapsulating first person experience.Verdict: The beautifully orchestrated soundtrack perfectly fits the mysterious and engrossing story line, filling the story with a soothing atmosphere.Score: 9/10Overall VerdictThis visually appealing game is definitely worth experiencing if you like peaceful games with a rich storyline.Overall Score: 8/10 ",734,301,31,61,74,4,98

""...but your fascination with the empty, and its cure, remained.""I've been getting endless recommendations about this game for a year now, from people who know me and my taste in games. Dear Esther was originally a free-to-play modification for the Source engine, developed and released in 2008 by The Chinese Room. The game is later redeveloped for commercial purposes in 2012, including the Steam version we have here.Our unknown and unreliable narrator opens his eyes on one shoreline of Hebridean Islands, and starts to walk. For the remainder of our experience, we will walk upon the surface of this forlorn island to discover its many wonders, abandoned mysteries and eerie beauties enhanced with a fantastic ambient music. We walk and bear witness to fragments of a tale concerning a loss, a death, a shepherd, a boat without a bottom, a love story and endless aphorisms of a broken mind, tested through a journey to embrace a final conclusion. We are there to complete an unfinished tale, accompanied only by eerie shadows of past tales that we feel and sometimes see with the corner of our eyes. ""Dear Esther"" says the narrator in one of his letters; ""I sometimes feel as if I’ve given birth to this island.""In its totality, many would categorize Dear Esther as a story exploration or walking simulation game. Yes, it is a walking simulation that will present you the most beautiful of environment designs harbored with genuine melancholy. But in my opinion Dear Esther is neither only a walking simulation, nor a consistent story revelation. It is, with all its grandeur and beauty in display, interactive literature. The script of the game arranged through aphorisms of the narrator is weaved out of allegories, metaphors, fleeting yet crushing narrative descriptions to accomplish a literary experience no lesser than James Joyce in feat. It may possibly take a literary career to completely appreciate the full context of this narrative beauty with tremendous subtext and symbolism.A full playthrough consists of 4 distinct chapters - monumental areas of the protagonist's journey. One singular chapter takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete, depending on your tendency to explore. It takes 3-4 playthroughs to reveal the whole script, which will accordingly reveal a new part in this symbolic feast every time. There is nothing to do in the traditional sense: only an experience to behold.If you are one to appreciate symbolic narrative and have an hour or two to spare, this is a short journey you shouldn't miss. Wear your headphones, kick back and start your exploration. Esther, The Hermit, Donnelly, Paul and Jacobson... they all wait for you in this island, forgotten in Hebrides.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

Product received for free
												Incredibly magical experience after this game. Everything fits together like a puzzle. You know the feeling, when you want to end the game (to know the ending) but also do not want to end (because the game is really good)? I had this feeling after finishing this game.StoryThe story begins on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere. Deserted island has one charm - nature. You have to go on a journey and with exploring the island, you also uncover parts of the story to the end, which is perfect.GraphicsI don't know what to say. The waves beating against the rocks, cold wind, in dense fog shrouded lighthouse, amazing night beach, gorgeous moon, caves - such a visual experience offered by Dear Esther. However, I miss there any wild animals on the island (i've seen just one seagull).AudioBeautiful soundtrack by Jessica Curry plays a big role with a voice of a narrator, who is very important in the story games. I must also mention great sounds of nature - like the sea, the wind, falling drops of water in the cave.GameplayWell, all you need to do in this game is just walk around and listen to a narrator, what is a great pity. Story like this just needs some investigations of items or searching for clues, eventually some easier puzzles. But I have to commend the developer console, which is enabled in the settings. Gameplay is really short (1-2 hours). PriceI get this game for free from my friend but I think that 9,99€ is enough because you can finish it in two hours. 9/10 ",237,65,6,19,16,1,21

												This game is a gamble. You'll either have a near-life changing emotional experience and come out a changed person, or... you will be bored witless on an otherwise pretty walk on an island. I fell in the latter group unfortunately, and I cannot recommend this game.			",102,19,1,8,8,0,10

												I did really end up enjoying it even if I can't recommend it. On the surface this has a lot going against it. Dear Esther feels like less of a game, more of an experience. You awaken on an island at one end under a lighthouse and you walk your way to a red beacon on a radio tower in the sky. The whole thing takes an hour or less to complete the experience. The controls are simple, walk and zoom. There is no jump or sprint.You will experience the morbid and yet gorgeous island in all of its glory. I say experience more than explore. As much as you can walk around and think you're doing your own thing, you're really just on a set path that is highly detailed and winds through coastal beaches, caves and cliff sides. It is a beautiful game and might be one of the most beautiful games ever visually.The day turning into night was a nice touch, even if at night you can end up completely blind by the dark. It seemed like the day and night wasn't random as the game claims, but if I died, it did become darker until I was unable to see.The whole thing is very immerse with only 3 loading 'screens' once the game begins. The game is short and sweet, it doesn't overstay its welcome for what is basically a glorified tech demo of the Source engine. Supposedly no play through is the same with different audio for each run, but when I played a second time everything felt the same even if I didn't hear the audio at the exact same spot. I explored a lot more, but everything was the same.You can also find it in a few bundles for less than $10 which then the price is worth it, but for 1 hour of an experience, I can't recommend it.

 ""How many dead shepherds could fill this hole?"" Dear Esther belongs to the class of video games which are hopelessly doomed to be criticized. The reason is gameplay. For you only execute three simple actions: walk, listen and watch. Formula like this can encourage a number of people to confer a title ""Walking Simulator - 2012"" on this adventure game from the young British developer  The Chinese Room , who previously worked on the atmospheric ""Half-Life 2"" mod ""Korsakovia"". But at this point gamers of all ages should ask themselves a question: do they need another rank-and-file FPS on already flooded modern VG market or are they open for innovative ideas and blending of various kinds of art?Dear Esther originated from a Source engine mod of the same name made by  The Chinese Room  back in 2008. In this completely reworked standalone only WASD and a mouse are required to play so get your left-hand middle finger ready. DE is to be considered as an unusual experiment which strays from traditional principles of electronic entertainment. Gameplay is stripped of some common adventure game features: interactive objects, logs, and puzzles. It may take the conventional fun away. However, all this may have been sacrificed for the sake of storytelling and creating more engaging and emotion-focused experience.Storyline is one of the strongest points of the title. Presented in a form of audio messages, it tells about the man who lives (lived?) as a hermit on a remote island in the Hebrides - an archipelago just off the coast of Scotland. Some time ago he wrote a letter to Esther, supposedly his spouse. Messages you hear while exploring are clippings from this writing. They appear when you reach certain spots of four different locations. This feature adds some replay value to a mature, if rather short journey as one can discover new shreds of the story scattered around the island should he visit places he missed in the previous play-through. Writing is top-notch, the narrator is sumptuous - shades of the great Richard Burton, who lent his voice for Jeff Wayne's 1978 epic rock opera ""War of the Worlds"". Overall, the story raises some major existential questions, leaves room for interpretation, and feels like it has been inspired by H.P. Lovecraft works.Dear Esther looks and sounds gorgeous. It is not about photo-realistic visuals but about crafty game of light and dark, sounds, colors, and shapes. The island feels alive: grass sways, water flows, caves breathe and glimmer. The result: the most impressive landscapes to compete in one league with Dishonored and Skyrim. Sound design is faithfully backing it all up as everything - from chilly wind to distant ship horns - sounds naturally yet unusual. Combined with serene, at times dreadful music by Jessica Curry, it makes a huge impact, immersing one deeply into the atmosphere.Giving the game credit where credit's due, it is more than just a bold experiment. Dear Esther is a title with an indie heart but a triple-A appeal. It is there to show that gaming has evolved and is not just about wanton shooting bravado anymore. It offers no challenge but challenges your mind. It doesn't pull of any tricks but occupies it's own niche and broadens the boundaries of PC and console gaming, thereby bringing rage upon itself. But anyway, for $10 you get 2 hours of sheer aesthetic joy on your machine. Only if your motto is ""No gameplay, no game"", there is nothing for you here and there will never be.

												In Dear Esther, you'll wander beautiful environments with no interaction or objective while listening to soothing ambient music, with any hope of immersion ruined by pretentious narration where every disconnected, nonsensical reference is emo's first metaphor. --SPOILERS--Finally, after an entire grueling hour, you will discover the two redeeming qualities the game has to offer: its extremely short length and the fact, I'm pretty sure, you ultimately commit suicide. I'd urge anyone planning on enduring this ""experience"" to enable the developer console in the options and increase your movement speed so you can kill yourself faster.

												The main problem with Dear Esther (contrary to popular belief,) isn't anything to do with the gameplay. It's 'exploration-focused' and lacks any form of conflict, but I have no real problem with that. You'll find some who spend time debating whether or not this is a game (it is,) but I think this is a useless diversion here. It doesn't really matter one way or the other. What does matter though, is whether it's aesthetically any good. It clearly attempts to deliver in two ways here, through the writing alone and through the connection between it and the world you're exploring. This means that the opening conceit which justifies it being a video game and indeed having any exploration is that the narrator says:"" I sometimes feel as if I’ve given birth to this island.""This leads to a game-length extended metaphor tying his emotions regarding the actual events of the story (which take place on the motorway in Britain,) to a hypothetical island. Unfortunately, the range and length of this metaphor means that a lot of it becomes stretched pretty thin, and limits a lot of the writing to only be able to speak in 'terms of an island.' This means that at times you do struggle to see the point of any of the speech about the island itself -- for instance, what are we supposed to gain by knowing how islanders traditionally and historically dealt with plagues? Very interesting - but doesn't help the story along in any way.The writing reads somewhat like a parody or imitation of that from a classic novel, but carries little of the same purpose or clarity. There are clever moments, for example the Damascus motif which seems to have been put in because the narrator experienced a 'turning point on the road.' (Though this eventually amounts to little more than a cultural reference.)  But a lot of it is stilted and even somewhat pointless - the 'kidney stone' motif goes nowhere and does nothing. It jumps through such a colossal range of themes that it can't take the time to establish any of them, and this isn't helped by the obscure structure. We're tied into exploring an island, and for the sake of player engagement and interest that means they have to put new scenery and things around most corners. This limits the writing even further, and forces it to find metaphorical links for a huge variety of things - which comes across as constrained when they spell it out, and increasingly obscure when they don't. In its defence, the stuffier moments of writing are somewhat masked by a fairly good voice acting job, which does provide a good sense of atmosphere along with the sound direction, (and not just because it's a British voice.)In conclusion, I don't think I can in good faith recommend it. The writing lurches uncomfortably from the island back to the motorway, and apart from establishing the conceit of the island (and in doing so providing an excuse for a video game-space,) it does very little else with it.

												The Short of It:Let's get this out in the open: ""Dear Esther"" is not a game.  It is a sublty-told story that is presented using visuals and narration.  In essence, you're walking through a poem.  It's beautiful to look at, has multiple ways of being interpreted, and causes you to question the story, sanity, and nature of the unknown narrator, whether the island itself is real or not, and even question yourself as the individual walking around the island.  It is not for the impatient, nor is it particularly cheery.  It is tragic, sorrowful and beautiful.The Long of It:""Dear Esther"" tells a story that is tragic, mournful, reality-bending and deliberately vague.  Each walk through it is slightly different, with the narration and visuals varying slightly each time.  I can't guarantee you'll be satisfied once you reach the end, because in a way, it says something different to each person who plays it.  Some people will go through it and be frustrated by having to walk such long distances without any option for a ""sprint"" button, while others will be perfectly happy to see the beautiful, desolate scenery go by while keeping their eyes peeled for the spirits which haunt the island, whether they be spectres, hallucinations, or unseen events from long ago.It's probably the single most visually impressive and beautiful world ever created in Half-Life 2's now aging graphics engine, and almost seems to pump new life into Source.  The only things which take away from the experience from a technical perspective are some of the physical objects which lose their realism when seen up close, and the fact that audio stutters happen at certain moments to jar the otherwise ethereal mood.I can see why some people don't like it because while in one way it's short (only 1.5 hours to get through) there's next to no interaction involved in that 90 minutes, so I can't fault anyone for saying it's too boring for them.  It's slow, contemplative, and not bristling with things to investigate.  So be forewarned that it will not be an exciting adventure.  For those who allow the narrative and environment to speak to them (both literally and figuratively,) it can carry quite a bit of emotional gravity.  All poetry is in a way, pretentious, so I don't blame those who describe ""Dear Esther"" that way.  However, there's something beautiful about well-constructed verse, and for anyone who's experienced loss, this game speaks volumes that they will relate to.I give it a thumbs-up for its artistry and subtlety.  Some people will complain that it's not worth $10 because it's a walking simulator.  Your mileage may vary, but I experienced ""Dear Esther"" as a guided meditation through one man's attempts at coping with loss.  For me, it was worth buying, and while it's not a title that I'll be launching more than once or twice, it's one I don't regret purchasing.			",73,32,0,2,3,1,4

NOTE - This game has been provided to me for free for review purposes.OverviewDear Esther is not a game, it is a walking simulator, and it is an experience. You walk on a deserted island, while your mind narrates some letters you wrote to Esther (hence the name). It focuses on the environment, the music, and the very detailed world to amaze and relax you.The Pros:Beautiful - The game is beautiful. The world is very detailed, put together with much care and thought. Every scenery is breath-taking. Lots of dense foliage, rocky cliffs, and watery caves. Wonderful lightning as well! This is a walking simulator, of course. It is meant for you to behold, to explore, to enjoy.Great Narrative - The narration is very well performed, and the contents are nice as well. Pay close attention and you will get a grasp of what happened in the past. I won't give details about them here. Experience them yourselves.Relaxing - Besides buying a game, you also get free relax pills. This is excellent for when you are stressed out. Just enter the game, pick a chapter, and slowly walk, breathe in deeply, enjoy the beauty. Works like a charm!Cons:Linear - The game doesn't allow you to stray too far off your obviously paved paths. There are some occasions where you will encounter dead ends, but fear not. Just turn around, look for 5 seconds and the true path will surely be revealed to you.One Hour - That is the approximate time you will spend walking around. This is the standard length of this type of games, and I am not disappointed with it's length. But the world is so well made, I just want to see more of it! ConclusionFor a 2012 game, this was a fresh breath of air. Good looking, interesting, and highly relaxing. If you like this type of games, get it, you won't regret it.If you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group ",165,42,3,13,27,0,16

												I've recently been exploring walking simulators and unfortunatley its been in descending order. Firewatch was engaging, interesting and immersive. Gone Home was slightly less immersive but still interesting enough to finish with fond thoughts. Dear Esther is far and and way the worst of those three and really is just a terrible game. Even for a walking simulator it was far too light on the game aspect of being a game. The lack of an interact button should have been a giveaway. At least in the above mentioned games you can amuse yourself throwing mugs off towers or turning on every light in the house. In Dear Esther you wander (VERY SLOWLY) around a deserted Island, probably in the Northern Atlantic. While you do so fragments of a fairly obvious story are told to you in a disjointed, fragmented manner. This makes its tough to figure out what's going on but even more confusing is that most of the time the fragments have nothing to do with what you are looking at. The much touted soundtrack cuts in and out with awful editing, at first i thought it was to add to the disquieting atmosphere but in hindsight it was probably just lazy like the story.Whats worse is that it felt like it was punishing me for exploring, as is basic instinct for gamers i dutifully went down every path and looked in every cave. Without fail there was no reward, no pay off, no collectables and mostly no new information. I think twice in the whole game my curiosity was rewarded with a little two line explosition that revealed nothing new. There are open-ended games but there is a different between open-ended and just adding random things. Twice i found a suitcase of clothes at the bottom of a cliff, why? Who knows. I found three bedrolls which make no sense if this is *SPOILER his mind/puratory*. The game touts its own mystery with things like ""What is the significance of the lighthouse?"" but honestly i don't think the writers even know. I finished the whole game in 2hrs which was both too short and too long. Too short in that it felt like a waste of money and too long in that the cripplingly slow walking pace, lack of interaction and confusing story made me wish for the end. If you are looking for a good walking simulator or an engaging story, do yourself a favour and look elsewhere.			",94,30,1,25,28,0,39

												Well, I finally got around to playing this after years of languishing in my backlog (3 years I think?). Initially, I didnt play it because my computer couldnt handle it and it kept freezing. However, I realized that since I had upgraded my GCU, there was no reason not to, and on maxed out settings no less. The game is in a word: BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, this might be one of the best looking games if not THE best looking game ever. It's probably a bit messed up, but I kept thinking that this is how Skyrim should have looked (not that Skyrim looked bad). Anyway, I digress. This is actual a mostly linear exploration game, where the story is revealed as you check out locations. The story itself is the subject of much speculation and debate. One thing that is not debatable is that this isnt exactly a happy story being told, although possibly it has a hopeful ending depending on how you perceive the entirety of the story. I will give my take on that at the end of this review so it wont spoil the game for anybody who doesnt want to read it. It is told in narrative fashion.The gameplay itself is simply you walking around, looking at stuff. You can zoom in, and that is exactly all your actual gameplay options.Keeps it pretty simple that way.I mentioned the graphics before, but seriously, the attention to detail, even the minutia of a scene, is fairly well flawless. I can find zero fault with it whatsoever. You will be truly amazed with this aspect of the game in my opinion. There are some really jaw dropping images in this game. If you are curious, take a peak at the 140 or so screenshots I took, lol (but be wary of spoilers in them).So, that is pretty much it. This game is perfection as far as walking simulator/exploration games go. I've seen nothing better yet. 10/10Alright, now to the SPOILERSIt is my opinion that our protagonist is a ghost, revisitng his final days, his final regrets, and finally coming to terms with everything. I am of the opinion that, whether or not s/he was actually dead (the voice is male, but the reality of his gender is ambiguous at best), he was at the very least hallucinating and/or in a hospitalized, drug induced state of disorientation. His mind is clearly fractured and I think the people he references (himself, Jacobson, Esther Donnelly) are all parts of his own consciousness. The cause was obviously an auto wreck, although maybe this was just metaphor as well, and I coulnt help but think that he had lost a daughter, which was the source of his wrecked mind. I dont know though. This story leaves a lot of your own subjective interpretation, which is actually another appealing aspect of this gameSPOILER/REVIEW END.			",2041,1027,52,317,205,18,280

												I don't normally do reviews because I'm too lazy and stuff, but this is such a good game that I have to write a positive review just in case I can persuade someone to buy this game and try it for themselves.Arguments about whether it's really a game or not don't matter, the point is that it's a deep, thought-provoking experience that I enjoy each time I play through it.  It's all about story, and this game tells its story in such a way that you kind of have to interpret it for yourself.No NPC's giving you exposition, no fetch quests, no half-naked elf women; Just a tragic, romantic, and deep story told amongst the beautiful scenery of an uninhabited Hebridean island.I definitely recommend giving this one a try.  Also the soundtrack is awesome.			",109,24,0,17,5,0,15

												Do not get this if you are expecting a game.You do not shoot anything, in fact there are no other characters or any other living things with the exception of a random bird or two.I wouldn't even recommend getting this at the full price of $10, but I am not hating on this.This little piece of software is in a strange little categoy that is hard to explain, but it is rather fun to walk around on this island and check things out, look at the beauty, and listen to the story unfold.  This is not a game it is dark poetry and I would highly recommend it if there is a steam sale on.   Be warned, you can complete the whole thing in about an hour...but since it is so short it is fun to walk through several times because you have a tendancy to find things you missed the first time.  P.S.  It has some pretty caves.			",106,16,0,9,5,0,6

												More of an experience than anything, Dear Esther delivers the stunning and riviting tale of a man who reflects his memories of his past wife who fatally died in a car crash. Exploring the area allows you to further understand the story, with a well laid out path for you to follow. The tale also inspires extremely beautiful visuals for just being a Source game, known for their fast pased gaming titles previously released. At a slow and easy pase, there's absolutely no distractions from a unrelaxing experience, rather you'll actually get some sort of sadness out of it. My experience playing it was great. I understood everything from the story, and was instantly hooked by the second of four chapters. The visuals were added bonuses. I loved every minute of it, up to the very end of the tale, with the game ending in the most scenic way possible, and provided a lovely score to it as well. I encourage you to give this game a try, no matter the price, because at the price I got it ($2 USD) I feel I should have payed more for such a beautiful and relaxing tale.			",382,112,18,35,48,7,18

												I'm a proponent for expanding our limited and stagnant definition of what constitutes a ""video game;"" that games like Dear Esther exist is a good thing for the medium. The more we challenge the status quo through the creation and the experience of such games, the more we do to progress video games as a medium of artistic worth. I'm glad that Dear Esther has been as well-received as it has been; it's a modest landmark for the real success that such experimental titles can find today.However, I am nothing if not a harsh critic, and Dear Esther has its problems, small piece of history that it is. It is possibly unfair to judge an experimental video game by the standards of more established media, but if video games expect to play in the big leagues, they shouldn't be exempt from playing by the same rules.But first, there are things which Dear Esther does right. Easiest to praise are the visuals, which depict the island on which you wander as lonely but yearning to be explored. Each point of visual interest has been crafted with great care – from the vistas to the smallest details, like a lone buoy, far offshore and barely visible.The size of the island itself is something to appreciate. Regardless of your feelings with regards to the game's very casual walking speed, the island's stretches of nothing have their own desolate beauty.But while the setting of Dear Esther can easily hold interest, its story has a much harder time attempting to do the same. From what you are allowed to piece together, the narrator is attempting a sort of redemption by exile. His disembodied voice pops in occasionally at certain checkpoints to provide you with vague details about what basically amounts to ""stuff."" A small collection of first names, a meandering history of the island, and unclear, melodramatic recollections of ailments and car crashes are some of what you can expect from these telling monologues that are anything but. I very quickly came to realize that the game's visuals were better than its writing deserved. It is frustrating.For a game like Dear Esther, the story's the thing. The plot here lacks so much specificity and context as to void its stabs at emotional poignancy. To be vague is one thing, but that artful reluctance to provide specifics is a better trait for a rational character than the opposite. When reasonable people are weighed down by guilt, the poetic musings they conjure surprise you by contrasting with the voice you expect; but the narrator of Dear Esther is too unhinged to make a clear point among all the overthinking. What we get is a voice that constantly oversells things and scurries back and forth much too often between too many incomplete themes. It is unsatisfying to follow and even more unsatisfying still to piece together. There are bits and pieces of good phrasing scattered within all the overwrought prose, but the story would have benefitted from the writers falling out of love with this character.Dear Esther was made in a time when video games needed a reinvention. It tried for some big things and for that it has my respect. Visually, it is a full experience; I just wish that same amount of polish and editing was present in its other, crucial half.

												Dear Esther is the remake of an experimental mod for Half-Life 2. The original was developed by a research project at the University of Portsmouth led by professor and media researcher Dan Pinchbeck.The first thing that is to say about Dear Esther is: It's not a game. It has no gameplay elements and its experimental approach makes it impossible to categorize. The author calls it a ""ghost story, told using first-person gaming technologies"" but I'm not sure there is a ghost. I'm not even sure there is a story. If I had to put a label on it I would call it an attempt to evoke emotions with a series of randomised snippets of poetry that roughly ape a narrative structure, presented in the form of software. Not interactive poetry because it doesn't allow interaction. You are confined to the role of an observer, you can listen and watch but that's it. No puzzles, no dialogues, no characters, nothing can be touched, you can't even run or jump.With the words ""Dear Esther, ..."" the unnamed narrator begins his monologue and you, the unnamed protagonist, begin your walk across an unnamed and uninhabited island. And walking (slowly, painfully slowly) is all you will be doing for the next 1-2 hours if you want to ""play"" through the whole thing... walking and listening to the narrator who will occasionally be throwing in snippets of letters and diary entries. While you're following the strictly linear path (you will encounter invisible barriers all the time) you will notice strange symbols carved into rocks, some mysterious drawings, some chemical formulas, even ultrasound pictures of a baby. Maybe they're intended as clues to help decipher some kind of cryptic story, maybe they mean nothing at all.The scenery is very well designed, the music unobtrusive but beautiful.For me, the narrative does nothing. I find it pretentious, flowery with no substance or meaning. My predominant feeling when I was ""playing"" Dear Esther was that of boredom. But that's just me. If you are curious about this storytelling-experiment, by all means, try it out for yourself. If you will enjoy the experience or not is purely a matter of personal taste.

												Very emotional, very beautiful. The atmosphere is stunningly strong and solid. There is a feeling of something dark and mysterious always lingering around, makes you paranoid, scared. The poetry is hard to understand and I didn't know what the man was talking about half of the time but it was beautiful and mysterious. The Source engine is perfectly utilized as the environments and all the details are absolutely breathtaking. The music and sounds are significant parts of the atmosphere. The game design is so good it doesn't need any item pickups, puzzles or any sort of advanced controls and that's a very unusual feat. It just works on it's own as an emotional, artistic experience and I think that modern games should be heading that direction to support the gameplay, or as in case of Dear Esther, be completely symbiotical, to create unforgettable games.

												Honestly, I am lacking the motivation to say much about Dear Esther. The fact that it is not a ""game"" does not bother me. The fact that it is literally a ""walking simulator"" does not bother me.There are many games (yes, I still say game) of that style that I have enjoyed over time. What bothered me is simply the writing itself and the choice to make narration pieces random. I tried my best to be absorbed by the narration, but the writing overall was lacking to me. You just walk these long distances to just get some little chunk of odd, unimpressive text read to you in a pretty unimpressive voice - why would I be excited about this?I did not feel much emotion from Dear Esther. The game is amazingly beautiful in how the island looks. But the narrator felt lackluster in comparison. I understand why some people got into it, but to me, it wasn't enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Positives:+ Visually stunning, the scenery is beautiful+ Enjoyable soundtrackNegatives:- Doesn't really feel like a game.  The only controls are to turn and move forward, with a zoom feature I never needed to use.  There's no interaction at all, you just walk along a mostly railroaded path, with occasional snippets breaking in to tell the story- The story is somewhat convoluted, and while it makes you think a bit, it didn't really hold my interest enough- It's extremely short, I finished the game/story in just over an hourComments:The graphics, scenery and sound track are excellent, but I just didn't really enjoy this ""game"".  The lack of any real interaction meant the story would have had to be incredible to really hold my interest, and I didn't find it to be so.  That, plus it being incredibly short, mean I can't really recommend Dear Esther.Overall Rating: 4/10 ",631,158,15,56,43,8,53

												Absolutely mesmerizing storytelling, with the tone of a masterfully penned novella and music that bears the weight of endless sorrow. An island that feels more like a character than a place. The only choice you have is to keep advancing or stop playing.Dear Esther manages to be a profound and unique experience, even though it consists solely of walking through a virtual environment and listening to a man slowly lose his sanity for a little over an hour. I've replayed it many times and loved it more each time, while still feeling like I hadn't understood all it had to offer. Whether you consider it a game or not, Dear Esther is certainly a work of art.			",217,58,7,22,10,1,20

 ""The journey is the reward."" Dear Esther (DE) is a first person experience developed by the company The Chinese Room with emphasis on exploration. Atmosphere & presentation: + A gloomy, atmospheric ambience with amazing visual effects.+ Melodramatic background music enriches the atmosphere.o The main objective is the exploration of the island.o Limited interaction with objects. Characters & story: + End sequence gives the game a philosophical meaning.o Next to the protagonist there are no other characters to interact with.o Replayability is dependent on the players perspective of the game.- Limited identification of the player with the protagonist.- Almost total lack of story telling activates, only a few letters tell the player about the circumstances.- Very short game that can be finished in less than one hour.  Summary: The Chinese Room has created with DE a game that has become the subject of controversial debates. To some players it represents a peaceful and tranquil experience, to others it is dull and pointless. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												I want the reader to completely understand that I do fully recommend Dear Esther.Even though I don't have any idea what it can be defined as.To call Dear Esther a ""walking simulator"" is unfair.However calling it a video game is also unfair.A game is: ""A competitive activity involving skill, chance, or endurance on the part of two or more opponents who play according to a set of rules, usually for their own amusement or for that of spectators.""Dear Esther contains no rules to follow or games of chance. It offers no opportunity to use any physical or mental endurance. There are no skills to learn, nor opponents that would attempt to prevent you from achieving any progress.So how would I define Dear Esther? I would call it what it is.An exploration of a digitally constructed island.Lets be honest, that is what you are getting with this title.You stroll around a gorgeous island with beautifully rendered scenery. The experience is also wonderfully complimented by a soothing soundtrack and eerily haunting dialog.My hope is that players will enjoy this thing of beauty.Which is why I won't go into detail about what you will see or hear.You simply need to experience it for yourself.I just want people to understand what they are buying.Dear Esther is a walk in the park.

What I found in Dear Esther was delightful.Dear Esther isn't a game. There is no challenge, you won't die, there are no baddies. For me Dear Esther is a beautiful blend of art, sound, poetry and story telling. If you take your time and look around it will take you 2-3 hours to reach the end, and if you can find a peaceful place to experience Dear Esther and let yourself be drawn into the mood you will have a wonderful experience. Turn the lights down, take your time and enjoy a proper little masterpiece.			",196,48,15,29,55,3,43

												It's not a game, it's a scripted story that you slowly wonder through whilst staring at the scenery. The whole thing works because the levels are so beautifully and artistically rendered. Don't expect your questions about this game to be answered, it's a very abstract and surreal experience but it really is worth trying. It's a virtual world, a place that you can get lost in for an hour or so. Escapism at its best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You walk around while the narrator reads you an irrelevant story. And pretty scenery?I could get behind this game if the story being read at least felt relevant to the stuff I was seeing or doing, but otherwise it just all feels lazy and boring. The story itself isn't even very interesting, and uses annoyingly flowery prose. The graphics aren't quite pretty enough for me to get by enjoying sightseeing, and the setting/environment doesn't get my curiousity going.If you want to see a game that takes a similar idea but does it better, look at Gone Home, where the story being read to you is related and relevant to the things you are seeing and interacting with (and said story is actually *interesting*).I guess I would give Dear Esther points for originality at the time, but I would rather just go for a walk in my local park while listening to an audiobook; same base experience, only better.

												""Dear Esther""A review by Richard Valkinsenn.""Dear Esther, I've begun my ascent.""In 2008, a mod was released for Half-Life 2 called Dear Esther. Originally created by TheChineseRoom, it was a brilliant experiment in emotional, narration-driven storytelling amid beautifully crafted scenery (to this day) and gorgeously composed music. Several years later, in 2012, Dear Esther was re-released as a standalone game on the Source Engine with remastered visuals, expanded scenery, and redone music. There's a burning question at hand, though: how is it?Well, that's an interesting question for many reasons. Dear Esther is not meant to be played like a traditional game, since there are no real objectives or obstacles in the game for the player to achieve or overcome, aside from progressing through the game's stunningly-detailed environments. Instead, Dear Esther is an experience, and it's an engrossing experience from start to finish. Essentially, Dear Esther is more of an interactive story than an actual game, as you move through environments with a narrator delivering subtle, yet emotional bits of monologue at various points throughout.Even though the game can be considered slow-paced, as the player is essentially forced to walk through the entirety of it's one to two hour-long experience, Dear Esther's true payoff is in its immersive qualities. And these cannot be overstated. Simply put, Dear Esther is gorgeous. From its very first second to its very last. Everything about it is top notch, from it's awe-inspiring art direction and visual style, to its hauntingly beautiful score by Jessica Curry, and even the voice acting from the narrator is pitch-perfect in its often heart-wrenching (yes, heart-wrenching) somberness, especially given the context of what he speaks, and what the player witnesses throughout.Of course, the game isn't without its faults, as the player's freedom of movement is severely limited and there's no enemies, obstacles, or threats to overcome. But then again, in an experience like Dear Esther, the ability to sprint or jump would be pointless. It's something meant to be slowly taken in, like a walk through an art museum (with really good art, I might add) or a trek through a wilderness, though there's no bears to worry about here. It's a work of art from start to finish. And one of the best-looking games built on the Source Engine. Sure it isn't about killing monsters or terrorists, or stopping the end of the world, but it simply doesn't have to be. It just has to be what it is.FINAL VERDICT:I loved Dear Esther.Thank you very much for reading my review of Dear Esther.Until next time, this is Richard.Signing off.			",149,15,0,7,8,0,1

												Dear Esther is not a game for everyone, as by most definitions it is hardly a game at all. What began as a Half-Life 2 mod has spiraled out into it's own experience, an interactive story told through the eyes and narration of a man lost to his own grief. You  are taken through a world that is meant to be observed and listened to but not interacted with, essentially casting you as a camera on wheels. As you slowly make your way along the paths of the island you are presented with a series of exquisitely written monologues, so meticulously penned in fact that the writer almost seems to lose his way at times detailing seemingly inconsequential facts and events sometimes fail to wrap up in the end. As they say, it's the journey that matters not the destination, but when said journey is so quickly over it's hard not to feel a bit empty inside when all is said and done with so little happening in between beginning and end.I do have to acknowledge the astonishingly beautiful graphics, with rich detail etched into every crevice and particularly impressive water effects, all of which makes it very hard to believe it is running on the aging Source engine. A haunting and evocative score often takes the place of dialog, sometimes even overpowering it, and sets a relaxed but all the same saddening tone that makes it hard not to feel something is amiss.In the end do I recommend Dear Esther? Yes, for those who can appreciate a game that tries something new and stretches the boundaries of what the medium can be. However, as a disappointingly brief experience (I completed it in under an hour), I couldn't advise purchasing it at full price. It's a journey I feel is worth taking, but not one that is worth paying a great deal for. For those wanting something more traditionally along the lines of a ""game"", you will probably want to skip it altogether. It is far from a must play, but if the style appeals to you, is definitely worth taking a small bit of your day to see for yourself.			",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

												Warning: this game is short and strange. Might cause dizziness, euphoria, feelings of solitude, hopelessness, recklessness, inspiration, urgent desire to run all over that island, smell that ocean and actually jump in that cave well. It drags you into a feverish run towards something you quite don't understand, and you run because there's no other way, because you have to know, to understand what it's all about, how it will end. It really is a walking dream. It's a short one, too, though you can come back to any chapter and keep exploring. I can't not recommend it, because I knew it wasn't in any way a traditional game, and I had an interesting experience playing it. However, you might find that it's just not your style, which is also normal. It's in the same boat with Gone Home, and I quite like the genre - though I'd love to see it evolve and expand in the nearest future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I paused, bathing and breathing deeply from the crisp, sobering seabreeze. I had traversed the shores of a beautiful coastline and earned the enjoyment of examining the island's breadth. Dilapidated archetecture and magnificent natural formations decorate the island in a constant allegory comparing the shortcomings of human life and spirituality when pitted against the immortality of nature.

												It's a self-guided walking tour.I really can't say I recommend it. This 'game' is not for everyone, it's far more an art piece than a game. It was an interesting experience, the graphics were lush and lovely, too. It looks like someone put a lot of love and time into this. A nice try at trying something new and different.However, it just seemed like it needed more to do in it. It's a walking sim. You walk around an a path, and listen to narration... that's about it. If you expect more, prepare for disappointment. I really wanted to interact with the beautiful environment. You can look, but not touch. I played through it once, maybe I'll play it again some day, but I'm not so sure it has any replayability. I do recommend getting this on sale, but not at full price.			",148,59,2,35,5,1,9

												It's often difficult to write about something that means so much to you personally. For me, Dear Esther lies in category. Over the 2 and a half years that I've owned and loved this game, I've tried to write a review, but often gave up because I could never find the words to describe my thoughts on it.It's one of the first and only games to move me emotionally, to make me truly  feel  something. A chilling sense of wonder about the beauty of life, and yet, the frailty of it all as well. Hope and hopelessness, both at once. Even as I wander down the same paths I have several times before, I find myself awed time and time again by the astounding beauty of something so simple as the view of a moonlit beach or a gentle breeze blowing through the grass. I load it up every so often, just to experience that world again. It's almost turned into a kind of private escape for me.To truly enjoy and appreciate this game, you must let yourself become immersed. The sights, along with the sounds, are stunning and realistic. The music and voice acting are top notch, and easily lands itself high on my list of favorite game soundtracks. There is no gameplay to speak of; it's simply a walking, exploration game, as the background of the characters and island are revealed as you move along. That being said, the world as well as the characters are interesting and mysterious, and drive the desire to keep diving further into the island.If you enjoy this type of game, do yourself a favor and get it. If you're not sure, get it, and remember to keep your mind open.			",26,18,1,6,8,0,2

Dear EstherThis review was last edited when I had completed one play through of the game.Short ReviewA short, atmospheric walking simulator style game with excellent graphics and an interesting story line.Long ReviewThe download was around 1Gb. Gameplay was about 1.5 hours for me to complete a single play through.The options are pretty basic, no key binding available but such is the simplicity of the controls this is no issue. The only one I changed was display mode where I could choose between full screen, Run In A Window & Windowed (No Border) and I chose the latter.When you start a new game you can choose from which of the four chapters to start from.You are thrown straight into the action (such that it is) with no tutorial but none is required as the only controls I used were WASD keys for movement & the mouse to look aroundThe game is played in first person and the game play is simply to wander about the location you find yourself in. Periodically text appears on the screen which is also played out in audio. I guess the idea is to piece together what happened to your character whilst taking in the terrific terrain and listening to the incidental music.You interact with nothing, you have no weapons to kill anything. The game is all about atmosphere and exploration, albeit in a linear fashion - this is not an open world game. You are inevitably drawn across the game world to a final conclusion.I can certainly understand why some people don't like this game but I loved it and will definitely play it through again as I'm sure I missed some bits out. It's a game to sit back and enjoy without any pressures or too much thought required.

												Monday, September 05, 20163:40 PMoh my gosh! i must review this game.this game is so amazing! i don't understand why the brats here have to negatively rate this game.. they obviously didn't read a damn thing about the game before buying it... then getting mad when it wasn't what they wanted. RESEARCH your games before you dumbly buy something and think you're going to have a fallout 4 experience… then write a crap review because the game wasn't what you wanted. FFS PEOPLE.NOW LISTENthis isn't your typical game, it is more of a physical audio book.. i think i'll have to play this a few times because i was so freaking blown away by the graphics and landscapes and places that i didn't take in the entire story.... I'm kind of in love with the graphics, though they're not the greatest, they are pretty awesome!( besides the flowers and mushrooms being completely flat and ""turn"" when you walk around/past them ) by the way, wtf devs? Could you REALLY not add solid freaking flowers?!???don't buy this game expecting a game, you don't interact with the world, you don't do anything but walk places and look and have your mind blown over and over.. enjoy the story. the end.not necessarily worth $10 ... about like 1/4th that, but it was worth it in my eyes.. i can replay this many many many times and the photographer in me will work hours to get some photos of this place ( which is my goal )			",50,13,0,8,7,0,1

												I've just finished the game. Let me sum up my impressions:+ The game has truly astounding visuals. Every single place during the game is scenic, every single angle is worth a screenhot. It really blows your mind that such graphics and atmosphere can be achieved with the ""aged"" Source engine.+ The soundtrack is incredible. It fits the mood and the narrative like a glove. It's neither too weak nor overwhelming.+ All the sounds in the game are carefully designed and they enhance the atmosphere greatly, especially the wind sounds.+ The story, when coupled with multiple playthroughs and perspectives and impressions of other players, prove to be actually very deep. + All in all, this game has an incredible atmosphere and a spooky mood.- The story, by itself, is very, very vague. You need to play multiple times and check other players' ideas and impressions to get the whole picture.- The walking speed is agonizingly slow. I know this is a game mechanic but in some places it could really be faster. At least we have the console code to increase the walking speed.In summary, I can recommend this game ONLY IF:*You are aware that this is actually a visual-novel, and not really a game. There is absolutely no interaction of any kind.*You are aware that you need to play multiple times and check the forums to understand the story better.*You aware that this is, as some others call it, ""a walking simulator.""I don't remember how much I paid for this game, but I think for 5 bucks or less, it's worth it. If you have a few hours to spare, this might be a good choice.			",677,189,33,92,87,5,142

												Wow, What can i say? The graphics in this game are absolutely stunning. I can't even begin to count the amount of screenshots i took. The areas are designed perfectly, with fascinating scenery and perfect lighting.Dear Esther is a game about taking your time to explore, Look around and take in the story. As you walk around perfectly sculpted areas, Voice acting: a well recorded, rather soothing voice tells a powerful, hard-hitting story which has been thoughtfully written. I thouroughly enjoyed my time playing through this game.If you like exploration games, Or just want a calm/casual/soothing game. I highly recommend this! However: Although i understand the game is meant to be slow paced, I feel the walking/movement is way too slow. Also i feel the game is quite short.  To sum up:  Pros: Insanely Beautiful graphics/ Scenery Intresting and engaging story It's a very calm and soothing game Cons:  The walking is EXTREMELY slow It's a fairly short gameI highly recommend this game, It's calm, fun, enjoyable.

												This is the most gorgeous game I could possibly run on my cruddy laptop. Even though the frame rate occasionally slips on broader viewpoints, I am stunned by the beauty of the environment alone. This took me a couple playthroughs to assess; about a year apart. I was unsure what to make of it at first. It is not a puzzle game, but it still made me think. The intermittent poetry highights the purpose of the protagonists pilgrimage in a very elegant manner. Musical composition is also very, very well done. It's hard to explain the depth of emotion which is not apparent at first look. Even though it is one of the most casual games I've ever played, I found the subject matter of life, death, passion and ambition to be more palpable than most stories told through video games. Then again, somebody I know just died, so perhaps facing that reality has made my second experience with this game more relative and compelling. I am content to explore the metaphores, meanings and landscapes simultaneously. I hope to see more like this soon.			",105,59,1,10,9,0,9

												Personally I found this game pretty good. The broken fragments of the narrator recalling letters he sent to Esther and the bits and pieces of left behind mysteries you find among your walk of the island are haunting yet calming. I find the game had me creating my own story of what happened, which personally I like as it's essentially reading a book that you get to visualize and make your own image of whats happening. There is a few points where you see figures among the mountains and in various areas, makes me wonder exactly what is happening, almost like following the life of a schizophrenic obsessed with a woman named Esther. I recommend it at sale price, not for 10$.			",65,14,2,9,32,1,21

												Pros:  Beautiful world and it's short.Cons:  Everything else.This is the sort of game people mean when they derisively use the term 'walking simulator'.  You walk around several (admittedly beautiful) locations, do absolutely nothing, and occasionally a bit of dialogue plays at random intervals.  You can decide to go off on some of the side paths, but they lead nowhere.  Or there's a fork where one way is a slightly lower path, and one way is a slightly higher path.  But they're like 6 feet away from each other and eventually they converge.As for the plot, I see some of the speculation on what the scraps of dialogue (and the evironment) really mean, and hearing people's interpretation can be interesting.  But I feel like this is sleight of hand that makes you feel like you're getting depth.  Like the series Lost - it raised a lot of questions, and there was a lot of speculation/interpretation by fans.  But while Lost tried unsucessfully to tie things together in a satisfying way, this just cuts off.Ending spoiler/rant: What the f**k?  WHAT THE F**K!?  You spend 1.5 hours walking around slowly, and the majority of the ending is going back through an area YOU JUST WENT THROUGH at a slightly faster pace?  All the mindless walking around is one of the worst parts of the 'experience', and the ending is just largely a more repetitive version of that?  I understand they had a few more things to put out there plot wise, but that was so cheap.  The game is only 1.5 hours, and the ending was the equivalent of a TV clip show episode?To make a much older analogy, take Planet of the Apes.  The original had a great ending for many reasons.  And the Tim Burton version also tried to have a suprise ending, but it didn't make any sense.  And it turns out it wasn't supposed to - they wanted to make people think/talk about it, but unlike Rod Sterlings script, there was no meat on those bones.  I'm not saying this 'experience' is that bad, but you get the idea.Anyway, if its really got you excited, please just watch a short YouTube video and enjoy some of the speculation, but please save your $10 (or $5).

												I played this when it first came out on Steam. And it stays with me to this day, unlike almost everything else I have played. The music is superb - bravo, Jessica Curry! - and the journey I took meant so much more to me than any other PC game.No, you cannot hop and jump etc. That takes some getting used to. But you don't need to. From the vistas to the haunting speeches, from the shock of a half-seen spectral figure to the jarringly unnatural elements of some of the scenery, such as car parts and glowing paintings, playing this game changed me. I genuinely experienced a great deal, and the ending left me speechless with joy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Walking simulator with a vague story.First: you don't do anything other than walk and observe in this game. Thus I only recommend this game to anyone who think they have the patience to enjoy the slow beauty of it. It's all about the experience and taking in the island you're on, and the experience takes about 2 hours. The game has some nice scenery and while the graphics are getting old it's still a beautiful island that you explore. The audio is good with ambience and a suitable narrator.The story is presented through fragmented narration as you explore the island, and eventually you get an idea of what has happened. I say idea rather than a clear picture, because after one playthrough the details were still vague. The intro is randomly narrated, so if that holds true for other parts of the island then it's possible that a second playthrough would tell you more. For me, however, the gameplay is too slow for a second run.I enjoyed the island itself more than the story, and therefore the game sometimes felt too slow to be a great experience.

												Dear Esther is a weird paradox of a game - in spite of its environments being incredibly realistic and beautiful, in spite of it having far and away more detail than its original 2008 mod version, it also doesn't feel real at all. It's like a painting - because you can look at it, but you can't touch it, you're reminded that nothing in it actually exists.I greatly enjoyed the original Dear Esther mod, but the reasons I enjoyed it were all unintentional, and all of them are lost in the remake. In the original, you could jump and sprint, you could even swim out of bounds and see the unmodeled backs of caves and mountains. You could pick things up, like paper sailboats, hear them knock against walls, throw them into the ocean and stare at them for a while. You couldn't hear anything clearly because of the poor audio mixing, so you made up conclusions completely unintended by the developers, made connections that were never written.In Dear Esther, all of this interactivity - no matter how minor, no matter how unintended it was as the result of the original mod copying HL2's basic gameplay systems - is gone. So, as a result, it feels less real than before. As a result, it loses much of it atmosphere. As a result, there's no longer any mystery about what it means. Even the intended mystery of what the island means and what it represents is lost, thanks to distracting new voice clips where the original voice actor somehow manages to sound twenty years older than he did before, new voice clips that spell out all of the meaning.So is the Dear Esther remake worth playing? I don't think so. As much as I dislike criticisms of these type of games as ""Walking Simulators,"" and as much as I enjoy games like Gone Home, I think it loses everything that made the original mod of Dear Esther special. I would recommend playing that instead, with the lights low and headphones on, without knowing in advance anything that happens or any theories about what it means - it's a unique experience, something that really can't be done outside of an unpolished mod of a video game, and I think it's much more special.

												Very beautiful walking simulator. The story takes place on an island. Sadly it is very straight forward, no much room for exploration. There are a couple of houses and caves that are optional to explore.The game is devided into 4 chapters, each will take about 10-20 minutes (depending on how much you explore the surrounding and take screenshots). Make sure to play this in one session, because when you exit the game, you have to start from chapter 1 again. Once you completed the game you can replay every chapter from the main menu.

Its so beautiful, gave me chills. Play this on max graphics and feel for yourself. Also try to see the ghosts. I saw 3 my first round.			",91,106,2,6,37,2,12

												Let me start by saying that this is not a game.It's more like an interactive story, you basically just walk in the game world and listen to various pieces of dialogue from the narrator until you reach the end in about 2 hours or so.This can be finished in one play so the price/experience ratio is not particularly good.If you just want a casual, ""deep"" story that should give you ""feelings"", then go for it when it's on sale.

												Different is great and artistic is great, but if you're going to make a game, the interactive aspect of the game medium has to be used. Sadly, the only thing you do in this linear game is hold the W key and point your mouse while the narrator talks. There's nothing to interact with, your actions mean nothing, and exploration is actively punished by an unhelpful terrain and a snail's pace walk. (See something interesting? Well climb down this little hill and look! Oh... Oh, its nothing. Oh well, I guess you'll have to walk back. No, no, not back to where you climbed down, that's too steep. No, go back. Back some more. No, not far enough, keep going. Just a little... no, no that way is blocked, too. Oh there, you go. Now you're back to the start of the trail. Just a few minutes and you'll back to where you were, but wasn't it so much more enriching to have gone over and looked at that ledge with nothing on it? Good job.)The only challenge in this game is holding the W key throughout 2+ hours without your hand becoming a locked claw. I started with my index finger, then to my middle and ring finger and on to my thumb (which didn't work well). I did eventually try holding a spoon down on the key with the heel of my hand, and that did the job nicely. In reality, Dear Ester is a movie (a dull one at that) that makes you hold down a button so as to keep you awake throughout it. This is no more a ""game"" than a movie with audio but no picture is a ""movie"". But if you want to go through it, it is at least short and the imagery is very pretty with a nice score. Just bring a spoon. Trust me.			",152,34,3,19,6,0,23

												Explore the serene island around you to discover clues that will help you unlock pieces of a multi-headed storyline, recalling memories in the beautiful moonlight and the warm sun. Sometimes frightening, sometimes sullen, sometimes heartwarming, the experience is memorable.PROS: Peaceful. So peaceful. Beautiful scenery Good exploration experience Amazing soundtrackCONS: Not for everyone (no action/puzzles/etc.)It really can only be described as an experience. You explore the island and, upon finding certain areas or items, will ""unlock"" part of the narrative ultimately giving you final say at what the story really is. It's not for everyone (if you're looking for action, item collection, etc.), but if you enjoy serene walks through nature to somewhat meloncholy music while talking to yourself with an Edgar Allan Poe voiceover, this is right up your alley!

												A lighthouse. Caves burning with stars. A moonlit bay. Altars of candles. A red beacon in the distance.Dear Esther evokes a sense of morose solitude, of persistent questions and scattered answers that require stitching together, like a gaping wound. It is not difficult to understand, but I found that wandering the island was in and of itself the reward. The reason. The question and the answer.The entire experience is breathtakingly beautiful, punctured by an exquisite score, a soft, dulcet narration, and the insatiable, earnest desire to simply explore. Thanks to the superb atmosphere, you are encouraged to stoke your curiosity. To savour the windswept cliffs, the shifting waters, the fragile moments of peace amidst ambiguity and doom. You will never lose your sense of direction, but you will lose yourself in the wonders of the island. You will want to come back. Dear Esther is, in a word, stunning.			",17,5,0,2,0,0,0

												This game starts out very slow. So slow, you might want to just close it. Press on. The term ""game"" is used pretty loosely when describing Dear Esther. It's much less a game, and more an immersive experience. You walk the island you're on, listening to the narrator piece together the story as you progress forward. Things get a little more surreal as you go. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's an experience worth having - like watching a good movie. It's about the length of one too. Unfortunately, like watching a movie (think The Sixth Sense), once you know how it plays out, there's little in the form of replay value. Sure, you might take a stroll again, but this isn't a game that you'll soon come back to, or play over and over. My only real complaint is that you walk slow. Relentlessly slow. There is no option to run or jump, and the game sometimes provides two paths - which are equally worth scoping out - but when you take a path that requires you to then turn around and trek back down the same trail to the fork, it feels like a real grind. That being said, $10 feels steep for the experience, but it IS an experience worth having nonetheless.			",325,81,12,19,23,6,24

Story is nothing special but Dear Ester have very nice atmosphere and because of that game can made you feel some emotions. The problem is dear ester is like a ONE hour long and it has no replay value. For that price this game should be relisted as a tech demo/benchmark because is actually very nice looking and sound is not bad…but it has no Benchmark or some other demo related options and because of that 6.99 price is too much.

												Considering this game is often on sale for dirt-cheap (and included in many humble bundles) it might be worth checking out if you're a fan of atmospheric walking simulator games.  However, there are two things I wish I had known going into this title:1). As many have stated in the reviews, it is art not a game.  The only thing you control is movement.  There are no puzzles and there is no challenge whatsoever.  Because of the limited controls, this leads to my second major problem with the game.2). It can be agonizingly slow and tedious.  I understand thechineseroom's decision not to include a sprint button, as this game is quite short and it would feel out of place.  However, a simple fastwalk button (or making Esther walk faster than a drunk snail) would have helped tremendously.  At several points in the game, you find yourself at one end of a HUGE plain or cliff that you must traverse to the other.  You will also make many wrong turns and have to turn around and re-tread these massive terrains.  The game requires a lot of patience and, unfortunately, it fails to deliver.This game does succeed in its gorgeous visuals (easily the selling-point, oddly enough) and the conventional British narrator.  It also has a very open-ended conclusion if that's your sort of thing.  But ultimately I find it difficult to recommend Dear Esther as a good game, if it's even a game at all.  While I'm not bitter about the dollar I probably spent on this title through a humble bundle, I still want my hour and a half back.			",58,12,1,7,4,0,7

												First of all I should say that I have so far found Dear Esther to be an intriguing, if not a lighthearted, experience. I'm glad I bought it, and I'm still discovering new threads to the story. That said, I can understand why some people wouldn't like it - it's not a traditional computer game in any sense. You can't jump, or run, or interact with the environment in any way. There's no guns, no goals, and no achievements. All you can do is wander slowly through a bleak but beautiful landscape, while the narrative unfolds.Dear Esther is a tale of love and loss, of grief and anger, of sickness and addiction, of the disintegration of a personality, and a desperate search for meaning amongst the ruins of a shattered life, of the hope for final redemption... oh, and yoghurt.There is, though, a trick to Dear Esther. The narrative, and various objects visible to the player, change every time you play. If you want to have any understanding of what's going on, you have to pay close attention not only to the dialogue, but also to the items around you - the photographs on the table, the letter on a pile of rubbish, the detritus on the beach. You have to play through it several times, because each time you gather different clues to the story. Whether you think the story is ever satisfactorily explained is a matter for you to decide. It certainly becomes more complicated. I find it fascinating.T : -)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I only played through it one time and I've heard that multiple run throughs can bring up some various changes in narration but that doesnt drive me to want to play again. There also was not any payoff at the end, it was far to open ended and didnt seem to have a point. It does look great and the audio is wonderful. Pick it up on a discount.			",26,19,0,3,2,0,0

Off the beaten path.I'm so glad there are developers like The Chinese Room out there, putting poetry into games, creating alternatives to the blockbuster & AAA experiences.  Dear Esther deserves the praise it has received since its modest beginnings as a F2P Source mod.More than one friend recommended this to me yet it was never quite high enough on my backlog of indie titles.  If you have waited on this like me, I urge you to bump it to the top of your list and finish a playthrough - it only takes an hour!  The first few minutes take some getting used to (your character walks slowly, & very little actually happens).This really is a glorified walking simulator with none of the conventional objectives or gameplay, so it does challenge the ""videogame"" definition.  It is a game though, one you should play & finish if you're in a thoughtful mood & looking for new, different, outside the box.  It's strictly exploration based & tells a (partial) story.  Evidently more of that story is unveiled on subsequent playthroughs, but one is enough to put the picture together.The visuals are phenomenal given what this is.  The audio is also commendable.  Together they create a couple of quietly stunning moments throughout the hour long stroll.  The atmosphere is impressive for something so minimalistic.  I took a dozen screenshots then decided not to post them, because people should just play it and take in the sights & sounds for themselves.The writing was also great; again, I love that the developers decided to go with such a poetic treatment.  My brain enjoyed how the narrator's words initially seem like ramblings but slowly piece together into a kind of sense.I'm eager to see what else this developer comes up with.  Given their methods, the possibilities for interesting stories seem endless.  I recommend.			",374,114,5,75,36,6,79

												This is a fantastic game, more of an interactive book than movie or game. The narrative is poetic, and moving. Graphically, every single frame is a painting and I found myself completely lost in the environments. If you fancy a break from run-and-gun, and just want a treat for your eyes that's easy, relaxing and visually stunning. This is a good shout. If you're after something involving, with puzzle-solving elements, maybe go for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter instead.			",136,31,2,28,21,1,36

												Understandably there are mixed reviews for this game. Generally people that seek out this game will do so because they have heard something about it that has interested them, or, at least, made them curious.So here are my two cents on some of the discussions that have been had:NO, this is not a 'game' in the conventional sense.NO, there is not any real 'gameplay'.NO, it will not test your skills YES, you are basically walking on an island to some music and narrative exposition.YES, it is slow paced and requires patience (which some may not have time for)YES, it will be art to some, and pointless or pretentious to others.Having got that out of the way, I, for one, loved this game. Again, it feels odd calling it a 'game' because it is basically an innovative way to use the medium to tell a story in a compelling way. 'Story' is pretty much all this is. A story being unravelled. However, in my opinion it is being told in the best medium possible to suit said story. The way I interpret it is almost a 'visual audiobook', that, like any storytelling, will give back to you what you put in.However, to simply call it a 'story' is still fairly vague and not that helpfull. So to provide more of a recommendation without spoiling the experience; to me, this is about grief. Explored through themes of life, death, nostalgia, guilt, isolation, generally through a romantacist exploration of a symbolic island. This was my experience, other's may get something different. If you want more of an idea, perhaps listen to the soundtrack on bandcamp by Jessica Curry.If you do not feel you have the time or patience, or are not in the frame of mind to sit passively and immerse yourself for an hour or two, I would give this a miss. But if you are tired of shooting up hookers, driving fast cars, and ranking up your combos list, and would like your mind to be more involved than your fingers, perhaps you should give it a try :)(p.s. I have no playtime listed as I played it before I had it on steam!)			",219,205,0,37,15,3,22

												***** - 5 StarsTRULY INCREDIBLE! If you're the sort of person who can hypothesise multiple different scenarios (likes to think :P) then this is perfect for you. With randomly generated dialogues each playthrough more information unfolds for you to further piece together the story. The first playthrough took me an hour and a half and the story/what I had pieced together clicked right at the end, EXTRAORDINARY how they managed to cause that to happen. Whether or not that was planned, it is still genius. Graphically this game is astounding and is up there with the best, further justifies the 5 stars that I rate this game.Have yet to replay through it but will be doing rapidly after writing this review!

												The best way to describe Dear Esther is ""different"". It's not a game in the traditional sense. No points; no fail-state; no mechanics to speak of, other than walking at a leisurely pace and looking around from a first-person point of view. For the duration of this movie-length experience, you simply look around and listen. For the cynical, this is a walking simulator, or the next logical step in audio-book evolution, or perhaps just an interesting tool for testing the Oculus Rift. For people who expect games to keep pushing into the realm of art, this will seem like a refreshing change of pace.			",172,32,3,12,18,1,26

												Dear Esther doesn't fall into the proper description of a ""game"" per sé, being more an ethereal and entangling experience, masterfully narrated by a splendid voice-over and a terrific soundtrack. It's time for you to get some alcohol, dim the lights and wear your headphones to hear about the events that led the unidentified narrator to his despair.Bornt as a free Half-Life² mod, Dear Esther has evolved into a fully-fledged Source ""art-game"", extremely well optimized, offering a pleasant and fluid experience on basically any hardware.

												  Great game, but ill give you some advices. Although it's a beatiful 'game'  with lots of symbolisms and a great design, it might be really unnerving to some people ( including myself), due to the solitude you may experience, it might even be a little 'depressing'. It's not a gory or tangible fear, it's a fearn born by  the subjectives meanings you'll give to the technically and artistically aspects of the game. Also, try to investigate and understand each single part of the island that you are allowed to roam, cause it will add more sense to the story you'll be creating.   I wouldn't rate it, because I don't really consider it a game, but If I had to, AND ONLY JUDGING THE ARTISTICS ASPECTS, I would give it an 8/10. ",52,12,0,8,6,0,4

												Dear Esther.While playing this, which I was graciously given by a friend, I was captivated by it. Not only did it had a good story line that made you think and put the pieces all together, but it has some of my favorite quotes ever! The voice that narrates this game is perfect for the part, and the text is very relatable, at least to me.Yes, if you did not read the game description or know anything about this game, it is a walking simulator. WALKING. No sprint (which isn't necissary since the scenery is perfect for viewing and exploring by means of a leasurely stroll, not a quick paced jog. walking simulators are meant for walking, not jogging).Even though it is a walking simulator, it is well made, as the graphics are very well done, meeting up with the graphics of Skyrim in a sense. The landscape, as i mentioned above, is gorgeous! Not only that, but the sound design (to which I recommend using headphones as this game has super well done sound design, which helps add to the game's atmosphere) is perfect, with natural sounds mixing and blending well with the somewhat peaceful, yet ambient, background of the game itself.Overall, I would recommend this game. It is very enjoyable and has a rich atmosphere around it.			",97,27,1,10,6,0,4

												THE GOODDear Esther is not your ordinary game. In some respects, it is not a game at all. Focusing on environments and atmosphere rather than gameplay and action is a nice way to change the pace, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who prefers Serious Sam and Doom over Amnesia and Proteus, I do not think this game is for you. The sound in the game is, well, not very exciting overall. The intro plops you into the island with explanation of why you are there, if you pay attention. The story is told by a nameless narrator, who talks about the island, his hobbies, and the mysterious Esther. Digging deeper into the story explains more about the characters and the settings, but only if you are willing to look.THE GREATThe game can be frightening and intense if you let it. Beautiful environments are accompanied by the haunting yet calming voice of the narrator, who tells his life to you. While not the best decision for gameplay, Dear Esther provides with an amazing narrative and an atmosphere that is so thick you could wrap yourself up in it. The first chapter is the make or break point in this game.While not looking very stunning, the first part does do its job to set up the second half of the game. Not giving away too much, but not boring you to the point of no return. The end of the second chapter is where it is its best. My aesthetic changes completely, music greets you immediately, and the haunting feeling kicks in. The third chapter is my personal favourite, with the climax of the game leaving you able to interpret it however you please.THE UGLYThere is no gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted gameplay, they could've at least given you the choice to turn off and on your flashlight, or maybe do some simple puzzle. Face the facts: You walk extremely slow. Perhaps for pacing, but it can be frustrating whil you spend the whole damn game going 10mph (That's metres, not miles). Also, for a game about discovery, there is very little to discover, not that you'd feel inclined to due the the speed of your walking. It can be quite boring if you're playing it after watching a walkthrough of it on Youtube, TwitchTV, or whatever place you use to watch gameplay videos, so I'd recommend not watching gameplay of Dear Esther before playing it. Also the visuals of Dear Esther deteriorates when it is put into videos, no matter how you set the graphical quality (1080p does NOT do this game justice via video).THE VERDICTThere are two types of people in the world. Type one is the type who prefer Proteus over Dear Esther, and the other type of people prefer Dear Esther over Proteus. I fall into the latter category, for many reasons. If in doubt, get it on a sale. If you like it, great news! If you don't, you spent $5 and 1.4GB 'playing' a game that you didn't like. Personally, I think that the third chapter is the best chapter in this game. For the first two chapters, you explore the island, and at the end of the second chapter, a forced plot point happens which sends you to the most beautiful part of this game. The final chapter wraps it up nicely, and some people will like the final chapter more, so suffice to say the second half f the game is generally liked more. Also, this is NOT a game for children. It can be difficult to understand and there are so many plot elements that are metaphors or relatively unusual.			",276,61,14,45,17,2,36

												I loaded up Dear Esther on my computer with high expectations. I'm a new gamer and have an arts background, so I have enjoyed exploring some of the indie games instead of the usual gun-blazing brain-blasters that seem to be so popular. I had just finished playing Gone Home and really enjoyed it. From the reviews I had read, Dear Esther was supposed to be an even better narrative-driven game. It wasn't.When I realized you can't DO anything -- no object engagement, swimming, or overcoming the tiniest of obstacles -- I patiently explored the island, waiting for something to happen. About an hour and a half into the game I decided to give up for the day, feeling like I'd seen a lot of stunningly beautiful landscapes, but that's about it. When I reloaded the game on another day, I discoverd I was forced to start from the beginning, and there was no way I was spending another hour and a half of walking an island with nothing happening just to get through the last of the dull storyline.I'm sure the story is great, though the metaphorical and lyrical language that guides the game was pushed too far and comes off a bit pompous-sounding. They tried too hard to be brilliant with this one, and it comes off as unnatural and forced. Skip it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recommend, with caveats. Most important: it's not really a 'game', in any meaningful sense of the word. It's more an interactive, beautiful, eerie, atmospheric story. If you think you might like that, it's probably worth a look. However, it is also incredibly short, and while it's not ridiculously priced, if you suspect you'd prefer to spend your money on a longer game... you might well be right. One final note: there is a longish section of the game where the camera angle and moving landscape combined to give me a real world headache, complete with nausea, which has never happened with any other game. It was very notsome, and given the length of time overall it took to play the game (broken up into sittings, because headache)... the headache probably lasted longer. Something to bear in mind if headaches might be a thing for you.			",15,13,0,16,3,0,1

												I had to play this game for my Game Studies minor, and I have to say that I'm happy for it. We had to compare it to many definitions that humanity scientists have given about games (which fit both video games and board games, for example) and had to write a short essay about why Dear Esther can be considered a game or not, and what this has to say about those definitions or the game. If this hadn't been the case, I would have written Dear Esther off as simply a weird game that was an experience, but nothing more. Now that I have to continue thinking about it, trying to add to the scientific discussion, I realise that Dear Esther is so much more than just a game. It worms its way into the game scene and causes many of us to doubt what we consider a video game, and others become angry at this so-called atrocity. But it has everything a game needs: a goal, immersive scenery, a story that needs telling. The thing is that, in my opinion, the game just doesn't give a damn whether you enjoy it or not; it simply is what it is. You don't get rewarded for rushing through the game in half an hour to see if the end makes sense. You get rewarded for taking your time, going through it multiple times, scanning everything that you see and hear for clues that may or may not give answers. You decide your own reward, because you decide what you do: do you forget about this game, or do you try to figure out what the hell is going on? For some, realisation is reward enough. Others need closure and a credit roll. But this game just doesn't care. And I love it for that cheekiness.			",40,19,1,4,5,0,1

												If you are an artistic person, I'd recommend this game. While the playthrough is short, the game itself offers an interesting way of story telling. And with that in mind, it is an experience that is quite special. The world itself is stunning and looks well done. The music is moving and only adds to the story telling experience. But I would not recommend this game should you not be interested in a short playthrough each time, and do not like the artistic side of games. Because this game is what I'd personally call a work of art. It's a story telling experience and it focuses on this heavily. It offers no gameplay other than exploring the available paths which are rather limited, but still pleasent, and listening to the story which varies each time you play.This is definitely an interesting experience. So if that is your cup of tea, then I do recommend giving this game a try, as it is very well done despite being so short.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, this game is really only an hour and a half of talking and walking. The gamer has no more agency than a cameraman, and even then very few events take place live-- it's mostly just an observation of a world previously inhabited, and a story already lived. Anyway, whether you'll like it or not, Dear Esther is well worth trying.The question of player agency is one that comes up a lot. To what extent we actually control the games we play, as opposed to merely go through the motions the designer set forth for us. But in much the same way that a fighting game focuses on one mechanic to the exclusion of others, Esther manages to home in on the player-as-observer, that cutscene-less methodology of the Half-Lifes and Portals of the world, and in that way, provoke both thought and discussion on the topic.Plus, those ghosts are amazing.

												This took me completely by surprise.It was described to me as a beautiful exploration game set on an island with an interesting narrative.This is exactly what it is, but it is a whole lot more as well.The narrative slowly presents the player with a backstory and, to me, this was done in a great way.At the end, everything is (sort of) clear and the game ends.After an hour.You can probably spend twice that if you explore every nook and cranny, but honestly, you shouldn't feel forced to.I was blown away by this game, though to avoid discussion you might want to label it an experience instead.Happy I finally gave this a try.

												This game is more of a walk through a Poetic Story. It talks about hermit, ascension, and lost loved ones all addressed as ""Dear Esther."" Althought the graphics are beautiful, there is some repetiveness in some areas with it such as marks, flowers, and little houses. The reason I recommend this is I could feel the words of this story touching me. For those who aren't into poetry, the story and feelings may be hard to understand. If you don't understand poetry well, then you may not like this game.			",569,356,11,81,63,6,65

												If you have the money for this, then it's a really aesthetically pleasing poem about love and loss. It goes for around a half hour, and if you play it another time, you get a different, randomized set of letters and stories the narrator tells about the same incident. It's good for winding down to, but doesn't have much in the interactivity department.			",190,31,2,20,29,0,24

												I have never been one for literature. I didn’t follow the story all that well but it was a nice experience none the less. It’s more of an interactive story then a “game”, but the graphics are really nice and it has some wonderful scenery in it. Which for me made it worth the time.I got this in a bundle, so I didn’t really pay much for it. One thing I would say is that if you are looking to have a gander at this a little further, wait until it is on sale. But that is just me.This is something that I think literature fans will really appreciate. At least a lot more then I was able to.			",422,282,31,20,33,5,36

												Possibly the most visually BEAUTIFUL game ever created.  Not to mention the most subtle ""horror"" game ever made:  There's apparently quite a number of ghosts to be spotted throughout, and you know how many I spotted on my first playthrough?  ZERO!  But there's plenty of YouTube videos to prove otherwise.     More than any other game I know of, this is definitely about what the player brings to the game.  If you don't like slowly moving through stunning, oddly spooky landscapes in which you MAY spot the occasional bit of activity other than grass blowing moodily in the breeze, this may not be the game for you.  Hell, it's barely even a ""game"" per se...more like a short (under two hour) journey through some awe-inspiring environments to an inevitably downbeat and haunting conclusion.     Not exactly ""scary"", and definitely not action-packed (to put it mildly!), this is nonetheless an experience worth indulging if you're the type of person who can get into something which is purely about MOOD and crap-all else.  Definitely NOT for those impatient ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who can't even wait in a Left 4 Dead 2 lobby for longer than twenty-eight-point-four seconds without kicking up a fuss.  Kind of a stop-and-smell-the-flowers experience for the morbidly inclined.  If that sounds like you, you know what to do.Verdict: 8.5/10.			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												I love this game its something I found myself coming back to for a relaxing couple of hours. The first time playing this game I was very uptight about going into the dark areas expecting something inside waiting for me only to find that I was the only one on the island. The game does a great job of conveying emotion and I found myself flustered and nearly shedding a near in the end. The music score is beautiful and the graphics are done very well.  The game on first play through can be completed in about two hours and with experience you can cut this down to about an hour. I would suggest getting this game on sale or in one of the humble bundles.			",200,40,11,31,19,5,31

												A very nice walking simulator, where the player walks forward while sightseeing an island and listens to the voice of a main character. Really nice environment, although audio lacks enough sounds. I recommend it to all fans of walking simulators on a sale for no more than 2€, because the ""game"" is extremely short - only about one hour. It's fun if you like the genre though.

												Dear Esther is a remarkable event. Not a game, exactly. More like an interactive tale.I don't think I'm giving anything away in saying that Dear Esther is not a traditional video game. It is a metaphorical journey, exploring sad themes of loss and regret. Your journey across the island is an evocation of a narrator's reflection on a single tragic event, and how it changed his (or possibly her) life.The story is not direct. It took about half of Dear Esther before the pieces began to fall in place for me, and there were many odd bits that I struggled to fit into the overall story. For example, it's not clear that the narration is all from a single person, or if it's the work of more than one person who experienced that same event. There are, I have learned, threads in the Steam forum dedicated to stringing the meaning of every bit of narration together, as if it's a puzzle to be solved. I'm not certain that it is meant to be solved, though. It's complicated, and it's subtle. I browsed those threads a bit after playing Dear Esther, and I was pleased to learn that there is no grand consensus on the meaning of this game.I suspect that a return trip through the island would make some elements more clear to me, but I am reluctant to take that journey again immediately. The experience of Dear Esther is like a beautifully-wrapped gift: much of the pleasure is derived in opening the package and admiring the craftsmanship; the gift within might not be the best part of the experience.Instead, I will treat dear Esther like a good book. It goes back on the shelf, and in a few years, I may get the desire to experience it again. Will I learn more in a second playthrough? Probably; I do when I read a good book again. But I've let a week go by before writing this review, and I find in reflection that Dear Esther was a powerful experience for me, and I'm pleased to simply reflect on the experience I've had. For now.One more comment: Dear Esther is also, perhaps unintentionally, a testament to the durability of the 10-year old Source engine. The island is beautiful. The vegetation is beautiful. The caves are breathtaking. It only takes an hour (or so) to play Dear Esther, but every moment is wallpaper-worthy. Even if this sort of ""game"" doesn't appeal to you, the stunning scenery is worth the price of admission. ",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												Do I recommend it or not ?Yes because it's gorgeous and has a great atmosphere / soundtrack.No because there's no interactivity with the world whatsoever, the story unfolds when you cross a checkpoint and that's it, you're spoon fed, no object manipulation, no discovery by yourself. For me, it's awkward and doesn't help with the immersion. On top of that add an irritating slow pace, the ""keep on track"" level design and a convoluted open interpretation story.Doesn't work for me, like reading a book with my imagination restrained.

												I'm sure there was meant to be lots of artistic meaning, but it's lost to me like it was all in another language. It's a story I want to know better, but the interaction is so weak it was difficult to build a story. Plenty of opportunities, little hints at some kind of interaction, only to turn out to be an empty tease. The whole game is chasing shadows, but not in a thrilling or curious way. Just annoying because nothing interesting ever happens. I don't feel I got my money's worth.			",30,23,1,3,13,0,4

												Dear Esther is a beautiful, touching, moving experience. It is as some have said, a work of art. As you move through the desolate island alone the story unfolds. The music is excellent too. This isn't a game. It is an experience. I hope that tells you enough to know if it would be for you. It took me a little under an hour and half to take this in.

												Work of Art or Complete Crap? On the one hand I love it divides opinion, focuses on storytelling and how it's trying something new. On the other hand I played 8 mins and got bored. Games at there heart are about interactivity, that's what makes them unique and what makes them the best storytelling form in my opinion. Dear Esther demonstrates what I think is the wrong way to make 'art games', art games should be about an individuals emotions or experiences, something personal. Tell a story through interactivity, if not, make a film.			",152,44,0,9,10,0,19

												My recommendation to anyone thinking about playing this game is to go into it with the proper mindset. It is not so much a game in the traditionally understood sense of the word. Rather, Dear Esther is an almost entirely cerebral experience. It works on the player in much the same way a good painting will effect an observer who sees in the art not merely a window looking out on our own world, but that same world slightly altered by the surreal, and thus bringing to light things about ourselves we might not otherwise see. That said, Dear Esther, by it's very poetic nature, is one of the most immediately captivating games I have encountered; I do not believe it should be overlooked simply because it does not conform to the usual way in which people have come to view video games.Overwhelming is the sense of solitude on this gloomy, desolate Hebridean island. Heavier still is the desperately sorrowful soundtrack, by Jessica Curry. In style, it is similar to film composer Christopher Young's most sparsely written music, and plays as a more effective voice in this introspective journey than does the admittedly potent narrator. I often find game music lacking in its ability to plunge beneath the fabric of a game and tug to light its individual and vibrantly beating heart, but this is a rare instance where such a feat is accomplished. Haunting as any chamber music has ever been, the score to Dear Esther will probe the emptiness within each of us, and get us contemplating questions most prefer to ignore.This is a relatively short journey, requiring the gamer to simply progress across the island until they have reached a lone radio mast. There are no decisions to be made, no objects to interact with, and the fragmented narration of the main character plays out as you progress. The epistolary narrative renders the intent of the story in a vague light, like a sequence of events seen through shimmering tears. It is debatable what Dear Esther is actually trying to say (and I believe it to have been done that way intentionally), but anyone willing to open themselves to the voices haunting this Scottish island are certain to draw some very strong conclusions.To me, the story deals primarily with unspeakable loss, and how we set ourselves up for even greater heartache (potentially leading even to madness) if God is not our anchor in all things. I, for one, see the issue of personal transcendence (as it is articulated at the end of the game by the main character's leap from the radio tower, who then begins a ghostly flight across the moon-dappled sea, followed by a black fade) to be illustrative not of our ability to achieve such a spiritual shift on our own, but exactly the opposite: There exists within fallen humanity a perpetual, aching cry to be delivered, redeemed--to transcend the shattering effects of our sinful natures.... But humanism cannot accomplish this miracle, nor any form of man-centered religion focusing on personal moral performance or upon the sincerity of their emotions as they are connected to a certain belief system. The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only atonement by which we can be saved from all this death. He is the only peace, the only Truth. The end result of all other efforts at redemption lead only to chilly shadows and vacuous spaces brimming with regret.Hopefully sharing my personal interpretation of Dear Esther does not come across as a clumsy effort to proselytize (if that were the case, I would certainly have given the Gospel in its fullness), but rather illustrates the power and versatility the player can expect to experience by such an unconventional game as this.For anyone looking to plunge beneath the surface within themselves as they embark upon the solitary journey to the radio tower, Dear Esther offers surprising treasures that periodically flash their brilliance even years after the experience has ended.

												Very boring, a true walking simulator.You can do nothing but walk and walk; there are no enigmas or riddles (I expected that), and basically you walk on a closed and forced path that eventually leads you to the end. The plot is pretty sad and surely not entertaining, even though the voice acting is as remarkable as the visuals and the music.I would recommend it to... none. There are games that try to create emotions, as Dear Esther does, without being this dramatic, sad and generally unappealing.I wish there was more other than the melancholic voice of a hopeless character in this game; I reached the end in an hour, and I didn't enjoy it. The replayability is absent, except of course if you want to go through the game again.Graphic: 7/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 4/10Longevity: 2/10Final Rating: 4/10Dear Esther fails hard bringing emotions and a fresh breath among the first person adventures.

This being; that the world is infact a representation of your manifested subconscious, inwhich case the game IS interactive and reactive in its truest form!)It's a game that is arguably not even a game at all. It's just a linear sight-seeing demonstration with poetry.BUT STILL, IT WAS GOOD! I won't have anyone talking♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game. Try it before you judge it. It's in a strage league of its own.

												Even though it's debatable that this is even a game, I would still really recommend Dear Esther purely because of the gorgeous graphics and heartbreaking (if a little confusing at first) storyline. Also, prepare yourself for the ending. It comes sooner than you would expect and breaks your heart into little tiny peices before sinking them to the bottom of the sea where no one will ever find them ever again. o A o Seriously tho, play it and you'll see what I mean.

												It's hard to write a review of this game, partly because whether or not it qualifies as a game is kind of hard to decide, and because it is such an emotional experience. Dear Esther is...well. The visuals are some of the most gorgeous things I have ever, ever seen in a game. There are certain views, different settings, even just the odd angle that absolutely took my breath away. The story is haunting and powerful, with scenes that were really moving. It's the gameplay that is so difficult to describe with any sort of appeal: there's no way to interact with your environment, no pick up/drop/hit/jump, anything. You can move, and you can swim a bit (really, it's just keeping you on the surface of the water), and that's all. You may wonder how any game can get away with that kind of control scheme, but Dear Esther does. It's a very touching story, and I found the ending powerful. Certainly worth the $2.50 I dropped on it for the Steam sale, I would say.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

Dear Esther is a masterpiece, and it will stay with you.			",299,122,7,51,24,4,52

												Preface: This is not actually a ""game"", it could be called a ""semi-interactive 3D graphic novel with variable paths"", it is not static, but interactions are limited to movement. However, there are opportunities for exploration and random elements.Who is Esther? Who is Donnely? Why are you on an island with old and recent ruins, but no signs of life except butterflies and vegetation? When and why did the seagulls leave? Did you just see something moving across the bay?""Dear Esther"" probably answers these questions, but if, those answers are wrapped inside riddles of their own. What you do get, however, is an enthralling and haunting journey across and below the island, struggling to piece together the protagonist's cryptic notes to an absent beloved.The landscape, only a backdrop in ordinary ""games"", steps up to present itself unharbored by the things that usually clutter it. For an indie product based on an already outdated engine, the serene scenes rival reality itself (unless you look too close at the ground in front of you)Getting into this ""game"" may be difficult, as the first chapter opens with two somewhat long dead ends you may literally run into (though they technically belong to the story in an optional way) but afterwards, the path becomes more linear, and you stop more often to admire the splendid view than to reorientate.You will experience the story, reflect, and maybe come back at a later time to experience it again, in a different way and with a different view.

												A short, abstract story piece steeped heavily in metaphor.  Dear Esther is one of the more extreme examples of a story-driven game, to the point where it's arguable that it's not really a game and is nothing but a story, albeit one where the delivery changes slightly from playthrough to playthrough.  That isn't to say that I feel ripped off, nor is the quality of Dear Esther bad.  In fact, I'd say this... experience, let's call it, has some of the more well done level design, set pieces, textures, and other resources of games of this era.  In general, the visuals and sound were done very, very well.What Dear Esther will raise the most objections is, unsurprisingly, the gameplay, which as I mentioned is so minimal as to be arguably absent.  You do control a character and wander around, but aside from movement and zooming that is all you can do.  It's not surprising that this is one of the titles which coined the term ""walking simulator"", though I'd argue that in this case it's not to its detriment.  Could it have been better with some puzzles, more exploration, perhaps a few enemies?  Possibly, but it quite easily could have been worse, too.  Is it bad in its current form?  No, not if you go into it knowing what to expect.Like or hate the choice made about gameplay, it still forces Dear Esther to stand on the merits of its story and presentation.  In that regard, it does quite well.  The story is delivered via letters (real or imagined, we aren't sure) written to the titular Esther (who also may be real or imagined, we aren't sure), read aloud at periodic intervals by the narrator, who may or may not also be the player character, we're not sure.  In other stories this lack of certainty about anything and/or everything might be a detriment.  For Dear Esther it works well, especially given how metaphor-laden the story is.  What is the metaphor and what is the real story... well we're not sure.  Regardless of what is real and what is the metaphor, the letters are read with emotion and meaning, and the circumstances they describe make it easy for the player to find themselves invested in the fate of the narrator.As for presentation, Dear Esther does a wonderful job of setting a mood of desolation, loneliness, and spookiness (for lack of a better word) without being high stress or anxiety inducing.  If anything the overall pace is relaxing; you don't feel like you need to progress to the next area until you are absolutely ready to, not that there's always something to stay behind for. Will Dear Esther be for everyone?  No, definitely not.  But just because something isn't for everyone doesn't mean it's fundamentally bad.  For those who enjoy the ""walking simulator"" genre coupled with a fair bit of metaphor, Dear Esther is a good choice.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												Less of a game and more of a traditional story, Dear Esther is best looked at like a strange and poetic tale about coping with loss. It eschews traditional gameplay and engagement for a slow and ponderous journey.  Its pacing gives the player the freedom to reflect on the subtleties of this extremely nuanced approach to storytelling.A word of caution: this breaks the mold of what one expects of gaming. Dear Esther can only give what you allow it to give, but to expect much more will only end in disappointment. A great example of gaming branching out into other forms of media.

												[The caves] Probably had some of the most beautifull pieces of scenery I've walked through in a game environment in a long while. I'd say this game is worth getting (Though I would recommend picking it up at a cheap discounted price) if you are into experimental storytelling type games. My main and really only gripe I had with this game is that you are stuck walking at a very slow pace which sort of diminished my desire/curiosity to explore all areas off of the ""main path"" without feeling like it was a chore to slowly walk out and back equally as slowly because I'm usually the type to walk around and adire all details put into the environment. Apparently this game also has hidden things for replayability. Also, don't expect this game to be super long. I think my final playthrough was about an hour and a half and that was with some extra time spent walking off the main path.			",164,52,12,8,13,3,6

												Dear Esther,It's been a while since I've felt so lonely. Where did the times of escapist games go? I don't remember the squawks of birds singing to my ears as a clear signal of their hostility, a pathological pointer of performances past. Every time I remember that night, the emotions rush back to me, the feeling that I should have done something lacerating the bones of my body.What should I have done? While I personally cannot vouch for certain, there are voices in my head, advices resounding. They sound like friends, old friends whose judgment I have trusted time before, and should continue to trust time again. I cannot say for sure who they are, but they only say one thing:""Get this game.""It's a long shot, Esther, but I might just take it.			",71,11,1,8,3,0,2

												Dear Esther supposedly transports the player to an island off the West Coast of England. The minimalistic pianomusic and the beautiful graphics stir an eerie feel of being lost in a desolate, deserted environment. As a game, Dear Esther is the sort of interactive medium that transcends the genre. Much like a great David Lynch movie should never be approached the same way one would approach a Star Wars, and is better to be perceived as a piece of art one gets to experience first hand. It hits home on a profound level without feeling the need to comprehend nor to put your finger directly on the heart of the matter. While information is seeping through in a disorderly way, it's only after the first play-through you start to analyse and put things into perspective, There's a reason the final cut scene is followed by a black screen you can only 'escape' from with said key. Still you'll be left with many questions and if you don't want to put hours into figuring it out, I srongly recommend the great youtube analysis on the game's story and events. For anyone who might get more thrilled by The Stanley Parable than Assassin's Creed, and prefers a good Kubrick or Lynch over an action packed blockbuster.			",3,10,0,1,0,0,0

												I've never 'played' any walking simulation/experience type games as this and for a while I was left asking myself ""what am I meant to be doing?"".However the graphics and music are beautiful and intruiged me enough to start walking.Thankfully the path is pretty straight forward and as you walk you hear narration in the form of a letter journal, telling the story behind the game.I only got 3/4 of the way through before I had to turn off, and it seems there is no save function. So I didn't get around to finishing it. Though I can watch Youtube videos which tell the story the same as in game.Depending on the price, to be honest, is whether I'd recommend it. There's not a lot to find hidden anywhere, the story isn't amazing, nor is it bad and the experience lasts around an hour. Value that as you will.			",237,72,8,26,38,1,36

												Dear Esther is a truly incredible. Once a simple mod for Half-Life 2 now is it's own ""game"" and I couldn't be more happy! Dear Esther isn't something I would call a game though, there's no action, no enemies but that doesn't matter. Dear Esther has such great visuals and a beautiful storyline too that it makes up for that. It's really like someone is reading you a well writen book while walking around an island. The story can be hard to follow sometimes and the ""game"" is really short. Also I wish you can buy the soundtrack separately like in ""To The Moon"", but those are my only complaints. If you really want to hear a excellent story late at night with the lights turned off, this game is for you!			",72,37,0,11,4,2,3

												This is not a game.It's astoundingly, breathtakingly pretty. But it's not a game.That's not a criticism, it's fact. Not a game. Games interact with the player, this does not. It's quite literally a walk-through storybook. There is no interactivity of any kind, no puzzles, nothing to figure out. It has exactly the same level of interactivity as a ride through Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland. You can choose where to walk, but that's almost entirely linear, so you're really only choosing where to look while you're walking there.That said, it's still fairly interesting. I went fairly slowly, exploring everything I could, though none of that makes any difference because there's nothing to find. At a slow pace and as indirectly as the game allowed, the entire thing took under 90 minutes from start to finish.It was interesting, but at full price ($10) that comes out to more than ten cents per minute... so I'd at least recommend waiting for a big sale.

												Rarely does a game have such impact on me. The word game is a stretch, its hard to even describe despite it despite being so simple. In most games you the player have an impact on the world. In this game the world and the narrative seem to impact the player. There are no goals, puzzles or quests. Only you and the experience and trying to make sense of the story and narration. In fact you could say its relaxing in a solitary and depressing fashion. Melancholy is a good word. The pensive and slow music, the sound of the violent ghostly wind and the cloudy depressing skies.  If you want action this is not the game for you. If you wnat to escape your real life and experience a profoundly emotional story through the exploration of a darkly beautiful deserted island, then this is for you.Some say 10 dollars is too much. But what price can you put on an experience that moves you and makes you feel and think? If nothing else, it shows that computer games can be so much more by being so much less, if that makes sense.

												Dear Esther is above & beyond your everyday, typical definition of a game. In fact, it can hardly be described as a game per se.

												An interesting experience. I'm of the mind that the post-game moments are superior to the in-game ones -- quite a few things to think about afterward -- but you have to get there somehow, right?edit: The writing is rather pretentious, and the gameplay isn't really remarkable. I think that Dear Esther could make for a nice change of pace between more frantic titles. It can be completed in 30-40 minutes (maybe less), so even if you aren't a huge fan, it's not much of a time sink.			",191,101,10,53,13,0,26

												I've never 'played' any walking simulation/experience type games as this and for a while I was left asking myself ""what am I meant to be doing?"".However the graphics and music are beautiful and intruiged me enough to start walking.Thankfully the path is pretty straight forward and as you walk you hear narration in the form of a letter journal, telling the story behind the game.I only got 3/4 of the way through before I had to turn off, and it seems there is no save function. So I didn't get around to finishing it. Though I can watch Youtube videos which tell the story the same as in game.Depending on the price, to be honest, is whether I'd recommend it. There's not a lot to find hidden anywhere, the story isn't amazing, nor is it bad and the experience lasts around an hour. Value that as you will.			",237,72,8,26,38,1,36

												Dear Esther is a truly incredible. Once a simple mod for Half-Life 2 now is it's own ""game"" and I couldn't be more happy! Dear Esther isn't something I would call a game though, there's no action, no enemies but that doesn't matter. Dear Esther has such great visuals and a beautiful storyline too that it makes up for that. It's really like someone is reading you a well writen book while walking around an island. The story can be hard to follow sometimes and the ""game"" is really short. Also I wish you can buy the soundtrack separately like in ""To The Moon"", but those are my only complaints. If you really want to hear a excellent story late at night with the lights turned off, this game is for you!			",72,37,0,11,4,2,3

												A short, abstract story piece steeped heavily in metaphor.  Dear Esther is one of the more extreme examples of a story-driven game, to the point where it's arguable that it's not really a game and is nothing but a story, albeit one where the delivery changes slightly from playthrough to playthrough.  That isn't to say that I feel ripped off, nor is the quality of Dear Esther bad.  In fact, I'd say this... experience, let's call it, has some of the more well done level design, set pieces, textures, and other resources of games of this era.  In general, the visuals and sound were done very, very well.What Dear Esther will raise the most objections is, unsurprisingly, the gameplay, which as I mentioned is so minimal as to be arguably absent.  You do control a character and wander around, but aside from movement and zooming that is all you can do.  It's not surprising that this is one of the titles which coined the term ""walking simulator"", though I'd argue that in this case it's not to its detriment.  Could it have been better with some puzzles, more exploration, perhaps a few enemies?  Possibly, but it quite easily could have been worse, too.  Is it bad in its current form?  No, not if you go into it knowing what to expect.Like or hate the choice made about gameplay, it still forces Dear Esther to stand on the merits of its story and presentation.  In that regard, it does quite well.  The story is delivered via letters (real or imagined, we aren't sure) written to the titular Esther (who also may be real or imagined, we aren't sure), read aloud at periodic intervals by the narrator, who may or may not also be the player character, we're not sure.  In other stories this lack of certainty about anything and/or everything might be a detriment.  For Dear Esther it works well, especially given how metaphor-laden the story is.  What is the metaphor and what is the real story... well we're not sure.  Regardless of what is real and what is the metaphor, the letters are read with emotion and meaning, and the circumstances they describe make it easy for the player to find themselves invested in the fate of the narrator.As for presentation, Dear Esther does a wonderful job of setting a mood of desolation, loneliness, and spookiness (for lack of a better word) without being high stress or anxiety inducing.  If anything the overall pace is relaxing; you don't feel like you need to progress to the next area until you are absolutely ready to, not that there's always something to stay behind for. Will Dear Esther be for everyone?  No, definitely not.  But just because something isn't for everyone doesn't mean it's fundamentally bad.  For those who enjoy the ""walking simulator"" genre coupled with a fair bit of metaphor, Dear Esther is a good choice.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

This small detail had a powerful impact on me as I experienced the story.Poo on any poo-pooers that would call this pretentious or purple. It is what it is, and it's done well.

												Game, Art, Storybook Novel?  Many Steam members have problems with Dear Esther - first of all it being a Free Mod and now is $10 on Steam and secondly the fact that this does not play out like a game per se at all.  In reality yes you just move forward and hit ""w"".  Sometimes (if your like me) you just need a break from all the blockbuster in your face action packed complex games that are available and Dear Esther for me fills that void.This interactive story shows off some incredible detail using the Source Engine.  I cranked the detal to all High and it looks sweet, really great scenery and environments.  The lush landscape is great - some of the best grass and water effects I have ever seen.  The textures are vivid and appear so realistic, in the caves portion surfaces look all wet - way cool.  The game comes with an interesting soundtrack that is a good balance and mix for the overall tone.There is no sense of direction in the game, you simply explore the somewhat linear path as pieces of the puzzle and narrative are revealed to you.  Again in case your not aware - there is no combat or anything it is a simple exploration story game.If your looking for a game to add to your casual game library then Dear Esther is  ✓Recommended for you!

												It's somewhat a rarity that I say this, when it comes down to walking simulator type games, but Dear Esther was quite a joy to play. With a fairly good story that has a sad but slightly uplifting ending, but I'd rather not spoil it. The island you explore throughout the game, although I use that term loosely, is somewhat beautiful and enchanting. There are mysterious caves to explore and quite breathtaking coastlines adorned with shipwrecks. As you explore the island you also quickly realize you are not quite alone. Strange figures stand watching you from a distance giving you a slight sense of unease. The game itself isn't all that long, taking just over half an hour to complete, that is of course if you don't go off exploring. There are several landmarks dotted around the island which serve little purpose other than to take screenshots of. But really it's best to stick to the main trail.Overall the game follows a fairly interesting narrative and combines it with a quite beautiful setting. It is of course a walking simulator and so there is very little to do other than explore the island, but if walking sims are your cup of tea then go ahead and give Dear Esther a go. But I only recommend it for those who enjoy narratives and exploration. Good day!			",292,75,3,32,18,0,15

												Dear Esther is an odd duck. This indie title screams, well, ""indie"".Artsy? CheckAmbitious? CheckAmbiguous? CheckBrief? CheckLacking Mass Appeal? CheckTo describe the game too well would spoil the experience. You begin on the shore of an island, with a narrator who may or may not be the voice of your character spouting difficult to follow lines with no context. You can wander (slowly) about the island, but you cannot jump or climb, and invisible walls keep you on the winding paths for the most part. You cannot interact with your environment, and there are no puzzles or challenges to overcome anyway. The only element of agency the player is given is the freedom to slowly walk about the island within the confines of the limited walkways.If that doesn't sound like much of a game to you, well, its not. Its not quite an interactive story either. Trying to piece together what the whole thing is all about is the only point to the experience. Once you have completed the game, you'll likely spend a few moments trying to piece together all the narrator's lines, and you might even consider playing through again so you can understand it all better. But if you do, you'll quickly realize there is simply no substance to the experience. The only motivation you had for progressing the first time around was to discover your motivation.It should probably be said that Dear Esther's environments are stunning and the haunting score is top-notch. But for all the beauty of Dear Esther's levels, you may feel resentful that you have no choice but to painstakingly amble through them without ever really feeling like you got to explore the place.Is Dear Esther worth the ticket price? Probably not for most of us. If you're a staunch patron of the indie devs, you probably already have it. For the rest of us, Dear Esther is a strange experiement or an unusual distraction, and not a feature worth shelling out for. But if you love wierd, high-brow indie titles, maybe Dear Esther is for you.			",203,42,3,40,12,3,25

												Dear Esther has a beautiful narrative. Boasts glorious graphics. And a fantastic sound design.So is the game perfect? No, no game is perfect. The problem with Dear Esther is that it's genre is ""first person experiment/art"". It's not that experimental. It didn't change the way games are played. It didn't even go as far as trying to emulate Myst, which is what I first thought of when I heard about this game being about a character stranded on a mysterious island. But is he actually stranded?Well. The game is certainly mysterious, but the island is not. It's the player character who traverses across the island to reach the radio tower's mast. And while doing so, sees candles already lit, beautiful caverns, painted stones and hallucinates an accident on a UK highway. There were a few times when I asked myself, ""Is this a dream?""From what you gather from the narrations, which are usually different each playthrough, is that the main narrator was in a car accident and his wife, presumably Esther, died. The context is slim, but you gather this much from the narration and the objects laid out across the island, like car parts, white paint cans, tires, letters, and abandoned boats.If I could call the game one word, it would be surreal, because it certainly doesn't abode as right. For the man supposed washed ashore this island following an accident on the mainland. That's surreal and unlikely.But it's sure as ♥♥♥♥ interesting and makes you wonder why the devs went with this game design and ploy. I liked it for what it is, mysterious and warranting a second playthrough based on the wonderful narrative.8.0/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												How do I explain this...Dear Esther is a story portrayed as an expierience. For those of you that want something with guns and monsters and jumpscares you'll be disappointed. This isn't that game. If you're looking for something that wil make you think, and requires more than just one sitting to get the point, THIS IS the game.The game takes anywhere from 50 (If you're rushing) minutes to 1 Hour and 10 (if you're really paying attention and trying to figure things out.) It does take about 4 playthroughs to get ALL the commentary, as it is Semi randomized for the purposes of immersion. And it IS immersive. You'll WANT to know who this guy is, you'll want to know what the island is about, and you'll WANT to hear the entire story.9.5/10. Not 10 out of 10 because there is no Sprinting, so it progresses slowly. Hence the hour long play time.			",65,9,0,5,6,0,2

												To call this a game would be almost entirely inaccurate; Dear Esther is more of a poem about the degradation of the mind, rather than a game itself. An engaging story of a man struggling with the death of his love, abandonment, guilt and his ultimate delve into insanity at the hands of an unforgiving, desolate island. The visuals, the weather, the sounds, the music and the narration all came together to bring an experience that was as immense and gratifying as the best of most genres. Dear Esther is a successful experiment and a singular experience. ",306,103,33,44,40,2,54

												In a word, perfection.  It's not a game in the traditional sense, not even close.  But, it is an experience that you won't forget.  You'll hit the screenshot button so many times at first due to the beautiful lighting and atmotsphere.  Eventually, I forgot to take screenshots because the story, the island, and the musical score drew me as I explored the caves.  Drawing your own conclusion is the ""point"" to this ""game.""Lighting is incredible and gives the island a dream-like feel.  Narration is spot-on although some later lines were done by a different narrator than you usually hear, which was annoying as their speeds of reading lines are very different.Note:Turn up the graphics under Options\Advanced Settings.  The increase in graphic settings didn't seem to effect my fps at all but it definitely made the game look a lot better.Also, you may get annoyed with the speed at which you move and the lack of ""sprinting"" ability.  But remember why you are meant to move slowly: to take it all in.			",96,27,0,11,20,0,1

I'm of the mind that the post-game moments are superior to the in-game ones -- quite a few things to think about afterward -- but you have to get there somehow, right?edit: The writing is rather pretentious, and the gameplay isn't really remarkable. I think that Dear Esther could make for a nice change of pace between more frantic titles. It can be completed in 30-40 minutes (maybe less), so even if you aren't a huge fan, it's not much of a time sink.			",191,101,10,53,13,0,26

Soon I found myself avid for meanings and understandings, along with fighting my own gamer instincts to stop vainly pressing my space bar.

												For a game whose mechanical elements revolve around exploration of a (usually) concrete physical space, Dear Esther is very abstract and contemplative – more akin to poetry than prose.

												Technically classified as a game, although there's hardly any gameplay involved. Dear Esther is an interesting concept that provides beautiful vistas and a captivating tale. Jessica Curry's musical score paints the somber and desolate theme wonderfully, which helped most of the game's graceful moments. That being said, it's freshing to witness game design that has a focus of showcasing artistic design for the gamer's interpretation, and providing a thought-provoking story, rather than traditional gameplay. If that at least vaguely interests you, despite its flaws, the game's two hours is definitely worth to experience. It's exciting to just know how there will be future games that'll follow suit of this concept, which will enhance the medium of storytelling in video games with minimal gameplay. Because it's artful.  ",94,20,1,7,0,1,2

It's a very rare game that can take me out of myself, give me a truly emotional and intellectual experience.If you care about video games at all, you owe it to yourself to play Dear Esther.

												Dear Esther supposedly transports the player to an island off the West Coast of England. The minimalistic pianomusic and the beautiful graphics stir an eerie feel of being lost in a desolate, deserted environment. As a game, Dear Esther is the sort of interactive medium that transcends the genre. Much like a great David Lynch movie should never be approached the same way one would approach a Star Wars, and is better to be perceived as a piece of art one gets to experience first hand. It hits home on a profound level without feeling the need to comprehend nor to put your finger directly on the heart of the matter. While information is seeping through in a disorderly way, it's only after the first play-through you start to analyse and put things into perspective, There's a reason the final cut scene is followed by a black screen you can only 'escape' from with said key. Still you'll be left with many questions and if you don't want to put hours into figuring it out, I srongly recommend the great youtube analysis on the game's story and events. For anyone who might get more thrilled by The Stanley Parable than Assassin's Creed, and prefers a good Kubrick or Lynch over an action packed blockbuster.			",3,10,0,1,0,0,0

												Difficult to recommend this game because in general, I have little time for indie games at all.I'm willing to make an exception here, on the proviso that you all understand this isn't strictly speaking a game, rather a mildly interactive short story.   A rather dark story with a gloomy atmosphere.Regardless, the graphics are impressive for an indy game, running very smoothly at 4K with a respectable set of customisations.    Narration is tasteful and effective.Atmospherically, the game hits the mark square on.   I won't go too deeply into it, because I recommend the curious should follow the grim story themselves, perhaps late at night with the lights turned down and a comforting glass of red.  The gameplay doesn't go on for long, which is appropriate, it's a novella, but the price isn't particularly high, either.Thumbs up for hitting the mark, doing something worthwhile, although I should stress this isn't a game in the classic sense, featuring only limited interaction with the environment.

												Short review about this game:The game is a small piece of art that is both appealing and boring at same time. The scenario is that you are stranded on a forgotten island and are free to explore its corners while a voice of a narrator accompanies you on your quite short journey. The island seems really beatiful in most places, especially having amazingly interesting caves with great artwork and gorgeous landscapes. The well composed music fits into the atmosphere and makes the journey relaxed, but still concentrated on the story.If you let yourself become part of the narrator's story and truly breath in this short but beatiful piece of art work, then im sure you will have some thoughts after the game about what actually happened, who's story it was and what can you learn out of it for your life. Maybe philosophical, maybe melancholic, but for sure enjoayble few hours.			",423,115,2,112,18,1,68

It unfolds as you make your way through a, quite possibly the single most beautiful, virtual island. It is truely unlike anything I've ever ""played"", and though I picked it up at the Steam Sale for just a meager €2 it is in fact, already the most valuable item in my Steam library. I don't just recommend this, I urge you to try this. It's not just a story either - visually it is by far the most impressive thing I've seen crafted with the source engine, possibly one of the prettiest game environments made too. Then there is the soundtrack; looking back at it I should've bought the game bundled with that soundtrack - it touches you right where it wants to. To all still reading this, make time to play this pearl.			",140,7,2,10,8,0,10

												A single review can't do this game justice.If you asked me to assign a numerical score to Dear Esther, I would be at a loss. The depth and significance of the ideas here are beyond any kind of quantification or simplistic analysis.I don't mean the thematic ideas: I mean the ideas for what video games can be, how they can rise beyond the pedestrian realms they have almost exclusively inhabited until recently. It's a very rare game that can take me out of myself, give me a truly emotional and intellectual experience.If you care about video games at all, you owe it to yourself to play Dear Esther.

												It's amazing that a game in which the only gameplay mechanic is walking can be so engrossing, let alone provide such a deep psychological impact. Your journey will take you across beautiful landscapes that provide a strong sense of solitude, while incredible voice acting will reveal bits of the mysterious story. This game is best played in one sitting. All of the scenes blend together and prepare you for an ending that will send shivers up your spine. All that said, the price is a bit steep for the playtime.			",24,3,0,5,3,0,0

												You start out on the docks of an island. The only thing that you know is that your name is Esther, and that someone is reading his letters to you. Playing in first person, you wander around a breathtaking environment, discovering the truth behind the island's infection and the fate of its inhabitants. While you walk, the narrator keeps informing you about what happened in the past, while you absorb the landscape's natural beauty and unveil a mystery on an island lost in time and space.The game is divided in 4 different chapters of short length. Dear Esther's goal is not to glue you in front of the screen for hours of challenge. It is to make you feel like you are taking part in a story that is narrated according to the letters and at the same time depicted on the effects of your surroundings before your very own eyes. The graphics are challenging for your pc but also extremely immersive for you as a result, and the soundtrack is magnificent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, this is not a game. If you go into this with those expectations, you'll be disappointed from the get go. Rather, this is an interactive experience.You may complain that you can't even run in this game, but that can be argued back as being a deliberate choice on the developers' part, one for keeping the pacing the way they want it to be able to tell you the story, and two, so you don't have to blitz through it, as this is quite short. It rewards exploration, as specific parts in the island will give you some lines from the fine narrator giving you tidbits of information about what may or what may not have happened here.It won't hurt your eyes either. Visually it's beautiful and just sucks you in with its richly done environments, managing to further immerse you into the story, which in the end, is what all of this is about.However this is hard to recommend. It's most definitely not for everyone, you could either absolutely love it, or hate it the second you start it. But it is very unique and good at what it ultimately does. Definitely pick it up in a sale to be absolutely sure whether or not this is your cup of tea. You may run into a gem here.			",858,258,31,163,96,14,179

												Great little game.In general, this is not really a game. It is more of a interactive art book, featuring how beautiful the Source Engine can be when its pushed to its boundaries.Throughout the 'game', you simply walk, can look at objects and from time to time, the character tells parts of a letter. Randomized through each playthrough, it can be replayed when one wants without hearing the same thing over and over.The other thing this game has, is a very nice, calming game soundtrack that captures the feeling of the game perfectly.So, this is a true recommendation. IF you know what you are buying. Don't buy it not knowing anything about it. Don't expect violence. Don't expect explosions. Don't expect enemies. It is a interactive art book wherein you walk and can freely look, made with the Source Engine.I liked this little game, hopefully many others can as well. :)A definite 8/10 at least.

												A quiet, reflective piece of art that is more of an interactive narrative than a game. As you progress through the landscape, the environment and narrative reveals your past and gives you clues as to who you are and why you are on the island...and what the island is. This game is like one of those short stories you had to read in English class. I happen to love interpreting metaphors and symbolism in literature, so this is a great pickup for me. But since it is so short  (I beat it in an hour), I suggest waiting until it's on sale.			",66,61,1,10,9,0,7

There are no enemies, no NPCs, no towns, no items, no skills--just you, the solemn Hebrides Islands, and the memory of a woman turned opaque.The premise is simple: you explore, and at certain checkpoints the narrator recounts his regrets. Remember that this game is meant to be art, so there's no extensive gameplay involved--only a sobering experience to be had. There's no rush here--you take your time, knowing that you will soon be together with Dear Esther.			",63,12,2,9,9,0,9

												Alright I'll write a review. Never done this before :(The game 'Dear Esther' started as a HL2 mod that recieved great praise due to completely leaving behind traditional gameplay mechanics, and instead focusing on you, the player, and how to form a relationship with the game. Shortly after development restarted in order to release it as a full game. The overhaul tooks a few years but in February of 2012, it was finally released.STORY:The story is randomly generated with new input being given from a narrator. He is the only human thing that you will encounter throughout your exploration on the abondoned island. The story get's a dramatic boost due to how the atmosphere draws you in, and with different readings being read to you from each playthrough, the more you re-enter 'Dear Esther' the better the story gets. It get's more mysterious each playthrough and leaves you wanting so much more, but never fully delivers. This leaves it open for speculation from the players, but that's what makes it so great. Everyone has an opinion and it can be further developed with subsequent playthroughs.The lack of a firm story may be ugly for some people, as the story pushes for you to think and put together the pieces of the puzzles and form your own opinion. However one this is for sure: you will be thinking about the story for days after playing 'Dear Esther'.GAMEPLAY:There really isn't much gameplay to talk about. You move at a walking pace and are confined to one button that zooms in ever-so slightly, but it doesn't feel enough. Every now and then when you enter a dim crevice, a flashlight will automatically turn on to help fill the area with light. If you are looking for a game that you want to control, rather then said game controlling you, this isn't the game for you. It's a bit difficult to bring yourself into the slow pace of the game, and it should have done a segmant to get the player in the mood (like old movies and how they play music for like 5 minutes before it actually begins, to get the audience in the mood of the movie) and it may allow the game to be more inviting to newcommers. You need to enter the game with an open mind, or you won't finish it. Simple as that.GRAPHICS:Compared to the games that are out, it lacks in quality. However, in comparison to games running on the Source Engine, it is breathtaking. The game is stunning, you will stop just to look  at the hills and mountains in the distance. You can see the formations of waves around the island and how they collide with the shore. You can count the clouds and watch how they manipulate the sky. The graphics contribute to the game's atmosphere greatly and make you sincerely appreciate how much work the developers put into the game. Be prepaired to get goose-bumps from the very beginning all the way to the end! There are some issues though: the 2d animated sprites for the bushes get distracting and are a bit annoying, considering how many are placed around the game. This issue is resolved when entering the cave segmants, but I wish the developers would have used a less distracting method to fill the landscape.SUMMARY:'Dear Esther' simply took my breath away and I'm still thinking about the game, months after I played it. The mystery that surrounds the island and your character is stunning, and it makes you want to really know the people that you are told about. The atmosphere will give you goosebumps and you will find yourself staring at greatly-detailed things that most games overlook. Overall, if you are willing to endulge yourself in a game without being immature, this is a great game for you!9.0/10			",444,86,11,18,37,6,39

												Hey guys, a lot of people have been asking me to tell them what I think of this game, so I'm going to write a review.  This ""game"" is definitely not for a majorty of people who regularly play games in general, but it's more for the people who want a short story where they can explore.  The pacing is incredibly slow, but it's mainly because of the limitation of your walk-speed (it's slower than crouchwalking in most FPS games nowadays).  It took me 1.1 hours to fully complete this game, and I was exploring everywhere I could and even got stuck on two parts!  It's a very short game, but the last half really impressed me with the music and the visual treats that you would have expected if you were following anything about this game.  I like artistic things like this, so I enjoyed it a bit, although I really honestly didn't like the first half and thought it was the most boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ever, but every game has its flaws.  Don't expect anything other than a visual treat with a story.			",380,70,3,37,17,3,34

Just wander through a story.It's not a long game (you're unlikely to need more than an hour and a half to play it all the way through unless you spend forever trying to make out every little detail), but it looks beautiful, and has some wonderful music (which makes the version with the soundtrack worth getting if you like slow and atmospheric stuff).Seriously, this is a game you buy for the visuals (especially in the more surreal parts of the game). The fact that the story changes a little each time you play gives you an excuse to go and look at them all again.I break it out for a relaxing afternoon every now and then, and recommend buying it for just that purpose.

You move at a walking pace and are confined to one button that zooms in ever-so slightly, but it doesn't feel enough. Every now and then when you enter a dim crevice, a flashlight will automatically turn on to help fill the area with light. If you are looking for a game that you want to control, rather then said game controlling you, this isn't the game for you. It's a bit difficult to bring yourself into the slow pace of the game, and it should have done a segmant to get the player in the mood (like old movies and how they play music for like 5 minutes before it actually begins, to get the audience in the mood of the movie) and it may allow the game to be more inviting to newcommers. You need to enter the game with an open mind, or you won't finish it. Simple as that.GRAPHICS:Compared to the games that are out, it lacks in quality. However, in comparison to games running on the Source Engine, it is breathtaking. The game is stunning, you will stop just to look  at the hills and mountains in the distance. You can see the formations of waves around the island and how they collide with the shore. You can count the clouds and watch how they manipulate the sky. The graphics contribute to the game's atmosphere greatly and make you sincerely appreciate how much work the developers put into the game. Be prepaired to get goose-bumps from the very beginning all the way to the end! There are some issues though: the 2d animated sprites for the bushes get distracting and are a bit annoying, considering how many are placed around the game. This issue is resolved when entering the cave segmants, but I wish the developers would have used a less distracting method to fill the landscape.SUMMARY:'Dear Esther' simply took my breath away and I'm still thinking about the game, months after I played it. The mystery that surrounds the island and your character is stunning, and it makes you want to really know the people that you are told about. The atmosphere will give you goosebumps and you will find yourself staring at greatly-detailed things that most games overlook. Overall, if you are willing to endulge yourself in a game without being immature, this is a great game for you!9.0/10			",444,86,11,18,37,6,39

												Great little game.In general, this is not really a game. It is more of a interactive art book, featuring how beautiful the Source Engine can be when its pushed to its boundaries.Throughout the 'game', you simply walk, can look at objects and from time to time, the character tells parts of a letter. Randomized through each playthrough, it can be replayed when one wants without hearing the same thing over and over.The other thing this game has, is a very nice, calming game soundtrack that captures the feeling of the game perfectly.So, this is a true recommendation. IF you know what you are buying. Don't buy it not knowing anything about it. Don't expect violence. Don't expect explosions. Don't expect enemies. It is a interactive art book wherein you walk and can freely look, made with the Source Engine.I liked this little game, hopefully many others can as well. :)A definite 8/10 at least.

												A quiet, reflective piece of art that is more of an interactive narrative than a game. As you progress through the landscape, the environment and narrative reveals your past and gives you clues as to who you are and why you are on the island...and what the island is. This game is like one of those short stories you had to read in English class. I happen to love interpreting metaphors and symbolism in literature, so this is a great pickup for me. But since it is so short  (I beat it in an hour), I suggest waiting until it's on sale.			",66,61,1,10,9,0,7

Told well from the surreal graphics, to the beautiful soundtrack, to the wonderful naration. This one is a keeper. Also know its gameplay time. It will range anywhere from 50 minutes to 2 hours to go through fully. I played through in one sitting. This game is designed to be explored. Sit back, turn off the lights, and enjoy this beautiful gaming experience that is one of a kind.			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												""Dear Esther"" is a simply astonishing indie game that enchants you with its vibrant fluorescent colours, its calming and mysterious ambience and of course its slow but driving story. The story really makes you feel like you are in the game itself, you are the character, you live on that island. The map is somewhat open, although it somehow makes you go a certain path which leads you to always new exciting or somehow sad places that always connect to the storyline in some way. ""Dear Esther""'s soundtrack is one art for itself though. It always plays the right calming and chilling music and underlines the storyline perfectly. You may have many questions towards the story like ""What is this, I'm used to open worlds and dragons!?"" The real question that you ask yourself once you see the island for the first time though is: ""How did I get here and what exactly am I doing here?""			",146,33,7,14,21,0,22

												Before playing the game, you must realize, you do not interact whatsoever... it's basically like a first person movie if anything. If i'm honest, the first 5-15 minutes of the game were spent me walking around mindlessly, not really interested in the story and not at all understanding where to go, as that was never said. Though, roughly 30 minutes in I began developing an interest in the story. The ending (trying to keep it spoiler free) is very sad, although, this may be because I am very empathetic, and I can understand how some people might not have the same feelings towards the game.Now onto the graphics/art... me being very fascinated by art and different types of scenery, this game was jaw droppingly beautiful. I couldn't stop admiring the art as I played. Some may see such a thing as a destraction, but this really added to the story. Overall, great game, i'd recommend to anyone who is willing to sit down for a story from time to time.			",7,5,0,1,2,0,0

												Absolutely gorgeous game with stunning visuals and an epic score. Dont be a retard and think you are gonna get headshots and  ♥♥♥♥ up some henchmen, this isnt some adhd explosion filled action ride where you shoot hookers and sell drugs. Its a quiet ode to true sortytelling and blurs the line between watching a movie and interactive entertainment. I started this game on a boring sunday summer night thinking it was a time killer. 30 mins in i was completely engrossed. The visuals and the quiet ambience made this game feel like it was a window to another world. It was a smooth and linear storytelling path that let you draw your own conclusions. My fav part was the cave exploration where you mucked around a dark cave with glimmering cryystals and rock formations. 10/10 AWESOME game. Also a disclaimer to little kids who think games are about action and leveling DONT BUY THIS. you are only gonna waste your mommys money and end up writing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review to an awesome game.

Dear Esther is one of my favorite games, and it's one that is greater than the sum of its parts.Let me start off with the basics. The game seems boring. You're a guy walking on an island. No enemies, no challenges, no explosions. However, the game makes it work. You're looking for something: Memories? Esther? Salvation? The atmosphere pulls you in, the music coaxes you along. You have this beautifully rendered island ahead of you, composed of somber hues. The red, blinking eye of a radio tower beckons on the horizon. The sun is setting.I'll admit, my description probably isn't very compelling, but the game is stunningly beautiful, if you give it a chance. The poetic narrative piques your curiosity. The musical score is both ambient and thoughtful and fits the game perfectly. The voice acting is stellar, and even though certain lines do get wordy, it works. Finally, every playthrough is slightly different. Now, that's probably not enough incentive to get you to play through the game again, but I'm glad I did. Something happened in my second playthrough that made it completely worth it. To be honest, it took my breath away. Here's my bottom line: 90% recommendedGameplay: 6/10 - There's not much to the gameplay. After all, you are essentially walking through an incredibly well disguised set of hallways. They are really well disguised though. Story: 8/10 - The minimalist storytelling could get frustrating if you're someone who hates BS. You have to let yourself get swept up by the aesthetics of the moment to really get the most out of it. The ""bits and pieces"" storytelling is neat, though. You almost feel like you're walking through the hallways of your mind, slowly discovering old memories. I gave it an 8 for the artistry. Graphics: 9/10 - Some of the most impressive Source engine graphics I've seen yet. They just work.Sound: 10/10 - The music is definitely one of my favorite parts about the game. It just does its job so well. Additionally, the ambient sounds such as the ocean waves and the wind seem very organic. They're very well done.Acting: 10/10 - Very convincing. A worse actor would not have been able to pull off the artsy dialogue.Controls: 10/10 - Simple. WADS to move, mouse to look. It allows you to focus on the game instead of on the buttons.GUI/Menus: 10/10 - Unobtrusive, elegant. What more can I say?			",119,23,2,13,5,1,21

												Game, Art, Storybook Novel?  Many Steam members have problems with Dear Esther - first of all it being a Free Mod and now is $10 on Steam and secondly the fact that this does not play out like a game per se at all.  In reality yes you just move forward and hit ""w"".  Sometimes (if your like me) you just need a break from all the blockbuster in your face action packed complex games that are available and Dear Esther for me fills that void.This interactive story shows off some incredible detail using the Source Engine.  I cranked the detal to all High and it looks sweet, really great scenery and environments.  The lush landscape is great - some of the best grass and water effects I have ever seen.  The textures are vivid and appear so realistic, in the caves portion surfaces look all wet - way cool.  The game comes with an interesting soundtrack that is a good balance and mix for the overall tone.There is no sense of direction in the game, you simply explore the somewhat linear path as pieces of the puzzle and narrative are revealed to you.  Again in case your not aware - there is no combat or anything it is a simple exploration story game.If your looking for a game to add to your casual game library then Dear Esther is  ✓Recommended for you!

												dear Esther is a beautiful game, some may find its lack of game mechanics to be a problem, boring etc. I found the game to be a calm cool relaxing play, every scene had me in awe at the beauty of it, I found myself staring at rock formations, and cave walls instead of progressing.

												""Dear Esther"" is everything but a video game and it most certainly should not be referred to as a ""game"". A interesting debate can spiral from here, regarding how the lack of differentiation from ""Third/First Person Virtual Experience"" and ""Video Game"" has torn assunder gamers and industry, but that is not what you need to know. You need to know that ""Dear Esther"" is a superbly executed, brilliantly written, beautiful and cinematic piece of interactive poetry that is not for everyone.If you are interested in a game, skip this.

												It contains beautiful scenery, but more than that it makes you feel like you are actually there. Not in a cheap realism kind of way, but in the way the atmosphere starts to fall over you and draw you in. The storyline winds and fades in and out so that you piece together what you can. It feels like the island itself is somehow responding to your figure slowly making its way across it, changing as you pass. The intricate, sideways comments somehow talk about life and death more directly than most other stories have.  Don't pass this one up. It is beautiful, something you will remember for years to come, and the like of which cannot be experienced anywhere else. You will feel peace. You will feel loneliness. You will feel sadness.

												A unique experience unlike anything else you have played before. Deeply emotional as the story progresses, this feels more like a visual as much as literal poem rather than a pure adventure game. It is certainly worth trying just for the shake of exploring alternative possibilities in the gaming experience. My only reservation is the lack of any interaction at all, and I am sure that this plus the shortness will put many people off. Nonetheless, it remains a path-breaking endeauvour.

												If you are hoping for a game where you can interact with the surroundings, don't buy Dear Esther.If you are opened to explore a beautiful designed place, a charming story and look around this beautiful island, buy Dear Esther.It took me around 1 hour to complete Dear Esther, it's quite short but it was even shorter for me because I was into the story that much that it seemed to me like it was 10 minutes.I would reccommend a buy for a reduced price as it is really short, but the music, story and graphics and desing from this ""graphic novel (?)"" really worth if you have an hour to relax and play Dear Esther.

												While many refer to Dear Esther as a walking simulator, I prefer to call it a carpal tunnel simulator. Or more accurately a carpal tunnel generator.If you ever did ubers for Diablo 2, just remember your hammerdin tricks and apply them here. A playing card shoved into your keyboard will save you a lot of pain later.There is no real interaction, but the music, graphics and well read bits of random story really do make this worth a run through.

												An incredibly beautiful and atmospheric ""game"". The graphics, sound design and general atmosphere of the game all blend perfectly together to create an ambience that is very encompassing. The game (if you can actually call it that) is fairly short but I feel that is justified because it does not over stay it's welcome. The mechanics are extremely simple move and zoom in that's it but they serve to propel you along a path through the story. The story is this games strong suit in my opinion, other than the mood. I won't spoil anything but it is a fairly bleak and tragic tale.Definitely a game that should not be missed if you are a fan of this type of game. A+			",832,218,29,100,73,12,139

												a dripstone cave ♥, bioluminescent fungi, phosphorescent moss, crystals, candles in nature, a full moon, a lost stormy beach and grassy hills... Dear Esther is a spiritual experience. it is visually poetic, profound in form and content, and absolutely magical.it starts quite plain but with a captivating atmosphere and slowly develops into an almost otherworldly, mystical journey. yes, you do have to do a lot of (slow) walking and, eventhough i am a quite slowpaced person, i first wasn't sure if i wanted to continue. i'm glad i did, because the journey concludes in a touching and extraordinary experience { - the cave - } which is open for a lot of interpretation. the last chapter had an emotionally healing effect on me - i have never experienced something as powerful in a videogame before.take your time ""playing"" this, maybe even at night. it is pure beauty.

												So what can I say about ''Dear Esther''...I simply wish that more developers would create games or content like this. Finally a developer who sees that a videogame is art and should be used to create art and not merely cheap thrill enterainment.This is a very very slowpaced arthouse game. You are not able to jump, run or use objects. You simply walk.Walk and think, think about life and death, and the strange place in between.The game leaves you with more questions than answers after you have played through it.It is a short game, takes only 1.5 hour of your lifetime. There are no archievements and no goals.You simply reflectt upon life itself.It is beautiful! Thank you so much for this game and for giving a 75% discount on it.This is pure love!

												You wander about an uninhabited island, observing and listening to segments of letters the narrator wrote to Esther.  Firstly, this is a story, not a game. It is only slightly interactive, you can not influence the outcome, but you can vary what you hear depending where you wander.  But there is nothing to solve and you can reach the end of the game without visiting all the places. I really don’t know what to make of this “game”.  It is a sad, haunting tale that is rather depressing.  Certainly, this is not one to cheer you up.  I think overall I have to recommend it, because it's just so well done, but I am afraid I am a happy ending type of person and had I known how haunting this little tale was going to be, I would not have bought it.

												Its an interesting artistic voyage and has its moments (like the caves). Not a game at all.  It gives you very little to work with, even the narrative sort of relies on you to think about what has been said and sort of fill in the blanks.The world is pretty and large, but its mod roots shine through. There is little point to the while excercise besides pointing out the meaningless of life. So yeah, its a barrel of laughs!Get it if its a couple of bux, otherwise only people who want to experience ALL that gaming has to offer will be interested in this.			",301,83,2,41,16,2,49

												It's basically a walk and explore game. You wash up on a deserted dock and start exploring an ""abandoned"" island. Graphically beautiful and with a strong story that the player simply uncovers by moving from location to location, this is a very relaxing game. Sounds, freedom to explore however you like, no complicated puzzles, beautifull graphics and smooth rendering environment and superb game mechanics. The sound Track is by Jessical Curry (and available separately.)Exploring the island is really a metaphor for the struggle in your mind as you mull over a motorway tragedy and you are left with the task of unpicking the guilt, the loss of what happened as well as why. If you complete this game without digging out any skeletons in your own closet, do let me know how you did that.5/5			",174,133,4,48,18,3,40

												I've had this experience in my library for a while now and it's taken me quite a while to decide whether or not to recommend this experience to the steam community.  I call it an experience because that's essentially all it is.  There's no real gameplay element to it aside from exploration and reflection.  This is essentially why I've had such a hard time deciding how to approach my recommendation (or possible non-recommendation) of this title.Now, I've never experienced the original mod that this solo release is based off of, so I'm submitting my thoughts as a result of only experiencing this particular version of ""Dear Esther.""  I view ""Dear Esther"" as an artistic experiment of immersion and subtle and vague storytelling where the user who experiences it is free to interpret it in their own way and come away with their own tailored experience.  Exploration is the main focus of ""Dear Esther"" and I mean that in a physical and verbal sense.  The more you explore of ""Dear Esther's"" world, the more of the story is shared with you.  It's exploration in a mostly linear sense, but there is still some illusion of freedom given to the user.  You'll likely find yourself looking everywhere and ""touching"" everything to try to shed more light on what is actually going on.  In a more clear sense, ""Dear Esther"" will likely make you feel as though you've stepped into a physical representation of the narrator’s journal, and essentially, that's the point in its design.  Total immersion.  There's no fighting.  There's no inventory management.  There's no health/mana/energy to worry about.  It's a story where you control the pace by moving through a world that's designed to expose more exposition eventually leading to realization and ending on the climax interestingly enough.  The resolution is left to you to decide, and that's not to say that ""Dear Esther"" is a complete cliff-hanger.  It's certainly not.  There is a solid and clear end, but the end is not a resolution.  You'll have to decide for yourself what, exactly, you just experienced, and what the ending means to you.Does it sound pretentious?  It should, because it most certainly can be if that's how you judge your experience.  If you're willing to reflect beyond the potential pretentiousness of it all, you may find something you like, possibly quite a bit.  I decided to go ahead and recommend this title because I believe it is an important experiment in how video game engines can be used to tell stories in an interesting way.  That's not meant to discount how well video games already tell stories, but I found it interesting enough to advise people to experience a different approach to virtual storytelling.  I'm sure a lot of ""gamers"" will dislike this title, but I honestly think a majority of Steam users will see the value in ""Dear Esther"" and what it represents.  For me, it was worth the cost as I enjoyed the experience (I'm the type of player that's always exploring and clicking on everything anyway.  Seriously, my play through times for RPGs are just silly long).  So yes, I've decided that ""Dear Esther"" is something I can with good conscience recommend to the Steam community.  It may seem niche at first, but it truly is made for a wide audience by design.Edit:  Repaired a few skipped words.  Added a sentence to the second-to-last paragraph for clarity's sake.

												I love these kind of games. Dear Esther is an interactive poetry.A man lost within his own world, represented as an abandoned island. As he walks, he studies the traces of his own past, in search for hope. All you do in this game is walking and listening to the narrator. But if you let yourself be taken by the narrative, the experience can be amazing. This game is really special to me, because it helped me think about my own situation of loss and confusion.The character starts walking on a familiar place, then he finds signs of a something terrible, that left marks on him. He is compelled to walk to another place. On the way, it seems to recite a letter to a woman. He also finds symbols of chemical elements and mysterious phrases.There are deep emotional scenes that makes you think: Is suffering necessary to find peace?Dear Esther is an emotional game, it requires patience. Do not expect any challenge. The challenge is to pay attention to details and assemble your own experience from the elements that are given. How much time do you decide to spend in a certain place, looking for a particular sign? What are you looking for? These elements will form the final narrative. So it all depends on you, really.Dear Esther is like a mirror. What do you see? I see a man going in and out of the cave, finding hope amid the rubble of his own life. So it was a worthwhile experience for me. It will not be for everyone. But that's the difference between a work of art and an entertainment product.Positive points* Amazing deep emotional moments.* Incredible graphics and sounds.Negative points* There is no challenge, it can't be played as a conventional game.

												This game has been sitting in my library for well over a year and today, for some reason or another, I finally decided to sit down and play it. I was very glad that I did. Dear Esther is a short, but extremely well done experience perhaps best compared to a vaguely written, but atmospheric short story. The visuals have retained all of their original beauty and the voice acting tells the story quite well. The pacing and pathing through the environment allowed me to ponder each portion of the story and the environment always made sense with what was happening or what had happened. I enjoyed the ending as well which if you are like me, may cause you to check the internet to make sure that your copy of the game isn't broken. Don't worry. It isn't. The ending is intentional and a smart change to the standard formula. Completely worth the 1 to 1.5 hour playtime and well done enough to deserve your money.			",225,46,4,35,37,1,45

Sure, people might say it's too slow, or too boring, but I feel like they might be missing out on one of the main points. This isn't about action that keeps things going fast, this isn't a full out adventure, It's a visually impressive game that has a pretty nice plot tied to it. Also, even if you don't want to bother with the whole story aspect, the game is worth it, just for screen shots of really impressive areas. :)			",247,21,4,19,15,1,21

												One of a kind game. Or, ""game"", rather - it's a story, really. For those of you who seek a game experience, you will likely end up disappointed; the rest of you, you are in for an experience like no other.It's been quite some time since I first played this game, and over the years, I've found myself repeatedly returning to it and, more importantly, its narration.I'll try to refrain from spoilers and just throw it out like this: once you're through, extract the audio files and try to arrange them in order. I believe you have little chance of appreciating the full beauty of this...thing...without doing so.And, once you think you've got THAT figured out, look up the authors' notes for translators, where they make a point of explaining their intentions and thoughts behind each and every line.Once you've done that - well, you're welcome!

												Dear Esther is interesting. It's not a game though. You simply walk through the place, looking at the pretty scenery and strange objects whilst listening to a story you have no context for. I've been told that the narration is randomized, so you might hear a different story on subsequent playthroughs.I suppose you can get really into it, trying to look for all the little details that might hint at clues to some big mystery, but I just didn't care all that much.This game can be worth it if you pick it up for very cheap, but not full price. It is definitely worth pulling up a YouTube video and checking out Dear Esther's beauty.			",346,240,8,54,48,7,30

												Certainly atmospheric and relatively pretty, this was an interesting title. The way the story is presented is a nice break from the linear chronology of games attempting something similar, and there are a few secrets to be found on the island which add a little flavour to the story and gives you the means to some personal interpretation. However, the map itself is disappointingly linear and could be greatly enhanced by more secrets and accessories to the story. I gave this a couple of playthroughs to discover whether the remixed chronology of the narrative actually change the story, but unfortunately my experience was essentially the same. Points given for visuals and storytelling, points retracted for lack of creativity and the overall feeling of incompleteness. [4/10]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game with big reservations.  It's interesting to play once for the experience, and the cave section is simply beautiful.  However, after all of the praise I heard about it, I was expecting an amazing story and it left me rather underwhelmed.  The walking speed is extremely slow, so rather than replay it to get the alternate dialogue, I simply read the full dialogue blurbs online after I completed it to make sure I read all of them.  The story wasn't bad, but I thought there would be more to it, and the alternate dialogue comments didn't add as much as I thought they would.  I might have felt differently if I had played the game when it came out, but I've played some more recent ""walking simulators"" first which had much more detailed stories so that raised my expectations.

												Dear Esther in one word: fascinating. It's a fascinating little gaming experiment that just scratches the surface of what I feel could be the most perfect form of storytelling since books. Legit. It really does feel like you're playing through a novel, albeit a very short one, which is its only flaw; it's waaay too short. Despite that, if you enjoyed the design and overall feel of Amnesia, but not the constant fear of death, then this is right up your alley. It's also one of the most visually stunning games I've ever played, even now with games out that factually have better graphics than this, I still think this looks better simply for its incredible visual (and also audio) design. But should you buy it for the full $10? No, unless you're a huge poetry, art, and video game enthusiast. Should you buy it on sale for $2.49? Maybe, I did and I think it was worth it, but (if you know me in person) I'd rather just have you play it on my laptop.			",221,44,6,16,15,2,11

												After having this game on my disk for a few years, I finally sat down to go through it.It was certain interesting... however I felt overall disappointed.  There was very little reward for exploring aside from the occasional narrative snippet.  This made me not want to explore, because it also added several minutes of painfully slow, unnarrated walking to return back to the fork.The story also seemed oddly predictable to me; it was just presented nicely with meandering, obtuse metaphors that just obfuscated the inevitable outcome.Finally, it felt unfinished.  There are a few touches that could have been made with minimal effort to wrap up the whole thing better.  Alas. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And in the feeling it leaves you with after finishing it.You might catch yourself days later, thinking about what you experienced on this island.But without question, it deserves to be played.

												What can be said about Dear Esther that hasn't already? The game is wonderfully atmospheric, featuring a nonlinear story that's engrossing as hell. The narration is spot on, with the narrator's posh British accent slowly becoming more and more deranged and frantic. The island itself is wonderfully detailed and gorgeous, despite the limited graphical power it was built from. It seems to be trendy as of late to hate this kind of game, but Dear Esther engages on ever level, and is an honest cornerstone in gaming history.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther isn't so much a conventional video game as it is an emotional and aesthetic journey through the limbo of ones mind. In the vein of walking simulator type experiences, Dear Esther keeps you strictly confined to a set path; without the ability to jump, interact with items, and so forth. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the narration absorbing, and the hauntingly beautiful score spectacular. Dear Esther's story unfolds within the protagonists mind, which after a life altering event is left reeling in limbo. The narrative is the progressive element to the story, with the terrain (visuals), reacting and representing concepts accordingly. Dear Esther is a truly beautiful and emotional experience, and although incredibly short, praise must be given to it's clearly very passionate developers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely stunning. I admit I was unimpressed with the dead-end meandering that I ran into during my first short shot at it, but once I put some thought into it, I was enthralled. As the story unfolds in its uniquely quiet, subtle, and shy way, and as the lush (and, at times, surreal) landscape reveals itself, you will not be capable of finding reason or ability to stop until you've reached the end. It's almost a boon that it will only take as long as a couple of hours to play; otherwise, you might just have to call off work, family life, and everything else until you've finished.

												As you will likely have read elsewhere, Dear Esther really stretches the notion of what is traditionally called ""a game."" This is a very good thing. This work is a real boon to the argument that video games can and should be considered a form of art. It is anything but pedestrian, and that is what makes it so special and so well loved.Dear Esther is visually astounding; journey deep into the island's caves and you will be utterly in awe of the beauty you find. The music is also noteworthy, always appropriate in intensity for the situation, and never overwhelming it. The semi-randomised narration contributes significantly to the player's emotional state while traversing the island: his rantings, musings, rage, and despair all help lend colour to the landscape, and keep the player firmly rooted in the world before them.Whether you would define Dear Esther as a game or not, it is without a doubt an experience you will not regret.

												I got this game because I had heard complaints that it was more of an interactive novel than a game. That kind of thing is right up my alley - it's the story I'm interested in. I had also seen some of the beautiful screen shots, and was eager to explore this little world.I was disappointed by both the story and the exploration. The world is, indeed, beautiful, and there are details like crushed cigarette packages on the ground and flowers waving in the breeze. The problem is that there isn't much more to it than what you can see in the trailer. After you've had a good look at the shack by the lighthouse and its surroundings, there's nothing new to see until you get to the caves. The caves are gorgeous, but again, once you've seen the first one, they all look more or less the same. And there is no real exploration. You really are just playing a story, and the railroad tracks are firmly installed. Now and then it might appear that you have a choice to make, but you don't. There's always only one way you can go - split paths always quickly meet back up again.The narrative is very poetic, often beautiful, sometimes touching. But there just isn't very much of it. The game description claims the audio, visuals, and ""events"" (not sure what events they refer to) are randomly generated, but I played through twice and they didn't seem to be. There was some slight variation in the order that you hear the various fragments of text, but not enough that I'd call it ""random."" Once you've played it through once, which takes about an hour, maybe 90 minutes if you really take your time and poke around a lot, there's not much of any reason to play through again. It seems meant to convey a feeling about a singular event more than to tell an actual story, and that only really works the first time through. Once you understand what's happening, it loses most of its emotional effect. I suppose if you have some personal connection to the event in question, it might be more significant, but I think most people will find it a bit too distant to have a lasting effect.Overall, the game is not *bad*, it's just lacking. If you want to spend an hour or so wandering through an eerie environment, listening to poetic voiceovers, then it's just fine. But don't expect any more than that, because that's all there is, really.If you can get the game at a big discount, or as a gift from someone, then it might be worth a play through. The price tag of 7 euros, however, seems awfully high for such a small amount of content.			",202,177,0,46,23,4,44

												If you enjoy having all fun taken out of playing a game, and instead replace that usual enjoyment with a very linear, slow story which instead of creating innovations in game design, create a very bland and mundane world whose only redeeming quality is one or two of the music tracks, and the beautiful scenery.

												Dear Esther is the most beautiful game I've seen use the source engine and has done immersion better than any game I have played before it. Although that may be it only lasting all of 40 minutes from start to finish. This isn’t a bad thing as the game does so much in its short time with the colors and amount of detail in each of the four sections throughout the island of Dear Esther giving this sense of wonder and mystery that is well accompanied by the sound design and haunting music all going towards creating this immersive and serene experience.  Its like that moment you have when you're just sitting there looking at or listening to the ocean, a thunder storm or whatever you find relaxing and it just recreates that moment of you have of peace but for an extended period of time, as a “Walking simulator” on this artful island with a story that is, well, forgettable compared to the rest of the game. It doesn’t detract from the experience it supposed to keep it moving forward but for me it was my interest in the island and what was waiting in the next few steps. The presentation of the games graphics and sound design is what made it for me but the story was just an afterthought and I find myself thinking more of the wonderful architecture to Dear Esther rather than the ending or the bits of narration leading up to it.

												Wow, just wow. This is NOT and I repeat NOT a game of anykind. It is merely an interactive story. You have no memory of who you are (or at least you are given no backgroun info), and you are all alone of an island. Nothing but birds and a lit up tower. This game emotionally appeals to me because while playing it you feel completely alone. As emo as it sounds, its a very nice feeling, you start thinking about life differently. And as CORNY as it sounds I do beleive this game has changed something inside of me. The metaphors in this game are astonishing and egnimic. The final scene of the game (lasts 2 seconds) incredibly makes everything clear. Bravo to this company, thank you for thinking outside the realm of FPS. 10/10 would reccommend to anyone who likes to at leat act intelligent from time to time.			",222,62,5,29,32,3,18

												Game is beautiful but collision mechanics are SUPER shoddy. For a game that is completely story based, it should have more of a path/direction. Got through 4 or 5 dialogs of the first chapter, then spent nearly 30 minutes sliding around on rocks trying to get somewhere new, retraced the enire island area available 5 or 6 times. Narration is top-notch, atmosphere was impressive, the story is probably great too, but if I can't even get there, who cares. Those things make the path failure even more frustrating and infuriating. I really wanted to play this. Complete fail. Not even going to bother with the other chapters...even if I can find my way through them, who wants 3/4 of a great story?

												Zero interaction with your environment, the game is a pure walking simulator with an extremely well crafted island, I found my self looking at the view, the sight-seeing for long periods of time. The story is told by the narrator by fragments randomly throughout the game as you progress. Do not expect a lucid story by the way, I guess the developers left an open ending with this unique style to make you create your own conclusions. And thanks to Jessica Curry, a beautiful soundtrack will escort you with the walkthrough, enjoy it. A 7/10 for me.			",127,56,0,11,7,0,17

												Another old play, late review piece of mine, for which I am really ashamed of, because Dear Esther deserves all the praise it can get.First and foremost: Dear Esther is not a game in a traditional sense, but rather an experiment on interactive storytelling. If we go out from Chris Crawford's (the mind behind the research on interactive storytelling), however, Dear Esther can't be even accounted that - it is more like an audiobook, where you are given the opportunity to look around and ""read"" the story in your own pace and the chapters in whatever order you wish, depending on which places you visit first. ""Walking simulator"" is a fitting cathegory, if you need to put it somewhere.*You take the role of a lonely, nameless male protagonist while re-visiting the island he used to live on, and which is now abandoned. While exploring the - otherwise beautifuflly depicted - island, you listen to his thoughts, telling you the story of what this place once was and what it means to him. As said, depending on where you go first, some ""chapters"" may come sooner or later, but overall, it is a complete story with a sudden - albeit somewhat expected - twist at the end. Dear Esther has beautiful graphics and captivating atmoshpere, the scenery is absolutely astonishing sometimes. I remember spending extra time just drinking some parts in, like the caves or the little path among the cliffs, with small flowers - in a sense, it is really romantic, actually. The music is soothing and somewhat chilling sometimes. I like to listen to it to this day - it still gives me goosebumps. It was one part for which the game won an award, after all.Dear Esther is not a long experience, so I highly recommend it to anyone who is short on time, but needs a little relaxation and stretching your senses beyond your worldy woes, be it studies or work.*Pardon my note on interactive storytelling, this is what I wrote my bachelor thesis about, and I included the game in it as an example of what an interactive story could be.

												★★★☆☆ - ""Worth a try, but only on a discount"" PROS:- Beautiful setting- As every path lead I embraced the games idea and the urge to get answers followed- Short and sweetCONS:- Its not really a game and will certainly not be to everyones taste- It doesn't live up to a games usual characteristics with walking your only interaction and because of this when I started this game I started to get bored, very fast- Boarderline choreVERDICT? In the end I felt it was an enjoyable experience, but I'm afraid thats all it is. I haven't taken much away from Dear Esther, whilst I understand where the games coming from I wouldn't play it again but I'm glad to have endured this unique art form.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

Some will be disappointed as it doesn't provide much, but what it does provide is an excellent 1 hour length journey.This 'game' isn't for everyone. Don't go in expecting some epic RPG or anything, just go in calm and relaxed, sit back and enjoy the ride.Oh, and look out for the spooky shades!			",271,55,4,35,18,3,42

												I waited forever to own this game. I bought it for steam when I thought they would natively support linux through it soon, but that was a long time ago. I ended up buying it on a bundle and tried that .deb build and screwed up my install of Ubuntu. After fixing that I played it though a wine install of Steam just fine...And I wasn't disappointed. The game is beautiful, and scenes are really well done. Was worth the wait.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Zero interaction with your environment, the game is a pure walking simulator with an extremely well crafted island, I found my self looking at the view, the sight-seeing for long periods of time. The story is told by the narrator by fragments randomly throughout the game as you progress. Do not expect a lucid story by the way, I guess the developers left an open ending with this unique style to make you create your own conclusions. And thanks to Jessica Curry, a beautiful soundtrack will escort you with the walkthrough, enjoy it. A 7/10 for me.			",127,56,0,11,7,0,17

												Game is beautiful but collision mechanics are SUPER shoddy. For a game that is completely story based, it should have more of a path/direction. Got through 4 or 5 dialogs of the first chapter, then spent nearly 30 minutes sliding around on rocks trying to get somewhere new, retraced the enire island area available 5 or 6 times. Narration is top-notch, atmosphere was impressive, the story is probably great too, but if I can't even get there, who cares. Those things make the path failure even more frustrating and infuriating. I really wanted to play this. Complete fail. Not even going to bother with the other chapters...even if I can find my way through them, who wants 3/4 of a great story?

												Wow, just wow. This is NOT and I repeat NOT a game of anykind. It is merely an interactive story. You have no memory of who you are (or at least you are given no backgroun info), and you are all alone of an island. Nothing but birds and a lit up tower. This game emotionally appeals to me because while playing it you feel completely alone. As emo as it sounds, its a very nice feeling, you start thinking about life differently. And as CORNY as it sounds I do beleive this game has changed something inside of me. The metaphors in this game are astonishing and egnimic. The final scene of the game (lasts 2 seconds) incredibly makes everything clear. Bravo to this company, thank you for thinking outside the realm of FPS. 10/10 would reccommend to anyone who likes to at leat act intelligent from time to time.			",222,62,5,29,32,3,18

												Dear Esther opens with the beginnings of a letter. As the game's protagonist sets foot onto a deserted island, he starts the game's morose, floridly allegorical narrative with the titular words, ""Dear Esther"". This letter written to Esther contains a rich story whose open-to-interpretation-type narrative makes multiple playthroughs of Dear Esther equally lurid and enlightening, despite the game's somewhat tedious gameplay elements. When paired with Dear Esther's ethereal environment, this narrative creates a deeply mournful and intriguing walking simulator.The player's journey up the island begins in the day time, beneath ominously gathered clouds and amid rolling hills of withered plantlife. The atmosphere of Dear Esther is filled with tragic elements that add to the story's themes of suffering and grief. During the first half of the journey, the player will pass by grounded ships and abandoned cottages. As the game continues on, the day will grow darker and soon you're plunged into the fantastical darkness of a cave that is illuminated by the rising moon and studded with chemically inspired, glow-in-the-dark paintings and lines of scripture. The environment of Dear Esther grows stormier and more otherworldly as it approaches the climax of the game.The astounding scenery of Dear Esther is paired with frequent pieces of narration from the story's main character. The character's letter to Esther is one filled with metaphors that will depict incredibly abstract images while instilling terrifically tangible emotions in the player. The style of the letter swings between a solemn sadness and a bitter rage, and often the contents of the letter are vague and disjointed—almost as if there are multiple letters and the player is only getting pieces of each one. Each sections of the letter unveils another piece of the story behind your character's climb to the beacon, while leaving enough room for you to speculate about some of the game's more ambiguous plot points.Completing more playthroughs of Dear Esther reveals more pieces of the game's shadowy plot; each piece of dialogue the player receives is one of many potential speeches delivered by a supurb voice actor. Untangling the mystery of Dear Esther's story is a slow and thoughtful journey that, with a little bit of patience, could leave you thinking about this game in moments when you least expect it. Dear Esther's literature quality writing and thought-provoking style of gameplay earns it a steady recommendation from me.			",118,64,2,22,12,0,11

												I finished this in less than an hour, at nearly £7 - I expected a whole lot more than a slow-paced walking simulator with a pretentious storyline (if you can even call it a story, it reads more like a slow drawn out journal excerpt). It's a very pretty game, but it's really not worth the price... I suggest getting Firewatch or Gone Home instead, they're a whole lot more interactive as story-telling games with a more planned out and intriguing storyline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first heard about Dear Esther in late 2011 while browsing the steam ""Coming Soon"" section. The music and poetic narrative of the trailer immediately caught my attention. The description of the game also spoke about ""random"" elements which greatly intrigued me. However closer to release I became less and less interested. I can't exactly remember why this was, maybe another game occupied my thoughts or I wasn't ready to pay the £6.99 for a game that took about 60 minutes to finish. Having only just played and completed Dear Esther for the first time it's a shame I lost interest and didn't purchase when it came out in February 2012.I won't get into the argument about whether Dear Esther is a game or not, I want to leave that to angry people on the internet. I will simply talk about what I thought.Five minutes in, the poetic narrative brimming with metaphors (and numerous other poetical devices) tells me I shouldn't follow the narrative too closely. For if I were to try and understand every word I would only get confused and muddled. Each paragraph of narration is somewhat like a standalone poem and only with all of them put together can you actually patch a story together. This works nicely as you can still enjoy the narrative as standalone pieces if you don't understand or miss the previous paragraph.That said I'm pretty sure the story of Dear Esther is purposely vague and confusing, designed partly for the sake of speculation and discussion. For some this could be frustrating as you aren't really supposed to understand anything clearly in the first few play-throughs. That doesn't mean you don't get anything out of the first play-through, but Dear Esther is definitely better suited to those very fond of analyzing the deeper meaning of literature and poems. After going through Dear Esther twice many aspects of the story still remain confusing but that's why I like it. There is a great element of mystery about the island, some details of which I will never understand. I adore that, but like I said earlier, others will find the lack of detail annoying.While there may be a lack of detail in the story, it would be a crime to say the same for the look of Dear Esther. The texture quality is disappointingly low but like a painting, standing back and looking at everything at once is breathtaking. The environment feels eerily natural, there were times I could swear I wasn't looking at a computer screen. The level design is clever too, it gives the illusion of wide open spaces and many possibilities while in reality being very linear. Not to mention the final area sent shivers down my spine continuously for longer than I've ever experienced.Definitely not for everyone, but well worth a try if you're interested.I give Dear Esther a ""Looks pretty damn good and brought a tear to my eye, out of 10"".Originally written for my blog over at: http://d-facegames.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/my-thunks-dear-esther.html ",166,41,2,20,27,0,24

												How do I even begin to describe Dear Esther?Well I'd say that it is interactive story telling, but that would be a lie because there is absolutely no interaction at all. For that matter I don't even think it is technically a story either, as it was only a series of letters read aloud in the third person not really containing any cohesive theme. I'd be hard pressed to even call it a video game as it contains not a single gameplay mechanic other than simply walking very slowly on an extremely linear path. Now all that being said I really enjoyed every minute of the experience, because that is all that it was, just a memorable audio/video experience.This is simply a stunning piece of motion artwork set to an amazing soudtrack. It was immersive, inflective and above all absolutely gorgeous. If you are looking for an exciting game keep looking. If you have ever wondered if video games should be considered as an independant art form, BUY THIS GAME.For what you get I wouldn't pay more than 5$ but it will be a money well spent if you do.

												Dear Esther is a beautifully poignant game, telling the story of a man's guilt with excellently written semi-random dialogue. Each playthrough gives you a unique set of clues hidden within the island, or spoken by the narrator. You piece together your own interpretation. The flawless environmentals and attention to detail, coupled with music that leaves you feeling melancholic, gives this game a slightly eerie atmosphere. You are not alone in this island. If you play this game expecting it to conform to what the majority would think a ""game"" is, then you will be sorely disappointed. Those who appreciate the arts would enjoy this game beyond negative criticism that it's ""boring"". It's excellently made, and I very much enjoyed the story. It's like plunging yourself into someone else's dream.			",115,28,3,21,16,1,16

												I only got 2.4 hours out of this according to Steam, and that was with a lot of backtracking (read more about why below, which might be considered a spoiler*) and stopping every few minutes to argue with racists on Twitter. Comparing with and contrasting against Gone Home, which I liked a lot, there's way less to do here. No interactivity (at all), a very unemotional delivery from the narrator, and just... not much to do. I get the point of walking simulators, but compared to GH, this is severely lacking. Even at £6.99 it feels steep.It's very pretty, no doubt, but that's not enough to save it. There are far better walking simulators (Gone Home) and far better ways to throw small amounts of money at smaller studios (Inside, Ori).*The game has a seemingly-deliberate habit of presenting multiple potential paths at several points, which if you're anything like me and want to make sure you've seen *everything* means you'll head off down one, get far enough that you believe that's the way you're supposed to go, then backtrack to the junction and explore the other route(s) first. All at an incredibly slow pace. It does this far too many times to be anything other than a deliberate attempt at lengthening playtime.			",39,9,0,2,1,0,2

												I played and completed ""Dear Esther"" within in 1.5 hours. The game tells a confused and chilling story amidst the Hebridean Isles. The graphics are amazing and beautiful, the soundtrack is really quite good too. The story, however, for the price of £6.99, falls short.The game has little to no replayability. I'm told by my friend Zoey that you can replay the game to unlock additional ""narratives"", but this, at best, is flavour. By the end of the game you ""get"" the story. I rather enjoyed it. However, I feel that if I had paid full price (and not picked it up in the Summer Sale for £1.75) I would be greatly disappointed.Don't go into this ""game"" expecting a game. It's more like an interactive novel. It wont provide you with action and guns and girls, but it will provide you with a unique little story, told in a desolate and beautiful landscape. Worth checking out; if it's on sale.-Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												A pretty stroll around an island, intersected at times with semi-random narration vaguely fleshing out your situation (which may change slightly each playthrough).It is decisively not funny. When you get down to the story, it's rather angsty if not outright depressive. Art at its finest, eh?I'm somewhat on the fence with this title. In real life I certainly enjoy solitary walks in an unfamiliar area, especially if it's nature oriented rather than industrialized, surrendering to my thoughts. And in video games I often enjoy dropping main storyline to just mess around and explore, if given game lends itself to it at all. But there's always a choice in the matter and other things to do as well along the way, not just sightseeing and meditating.Whereas Dear Esther is pretty much only the latter. A virtual piece of art, painting/installation with smidgens of verbal narrative, but with zero interaction other than just walking around, pressing forward to push story a bit, see more, and get mind screwed. Even flashlight turns on automatically. It's painting in the medium of video games, but itself is not really a video game at all.In the end I'd still recommend it, just to experience something different, but if you're not feeling particularly artsy you likely aren't going to enjoy it on any level. However, I am certainly looking forward to reliving it once VR becomes a thing, as this title lends itself perfectly to the whole notion. Really nice scenery porn.			",360,123,16,65,24,3,110

												A game taking place on a deserted, dismal Hebridean island, housing a peculiar, unobtrusive wandering, promptly sounds like the concept of an experiment. Given the complete absence of interaction between the player and the game, as the nameless player's protagonist without visual identification strolls through the mist, while the release of random sound recordings of letters read out loud to a woman named Esther, it is indeed in fact an experiment. The identity of the woman is unclear, as is the relationship between the two of you; however, as you progress through the windblown beaches, the moors, the deep caves as well as the lighthouse - towards the peak of the island - detached diary notes depict the outlines of a tragic accident, and a ghostly tale appears.The story of Dear Esther is utterly obscure and abstract. Cryptic biblical quotation is occasionally displayed on the surroundings, and out of the sound recordings the history of the island surface, along with the hints of a freeway, the disclosure of a fatal car crash, and three personalities; a shepherd with syphilis, an explorer whose infected wounds made him mad, and a broken man with guilt involving the mentioned car accident. However, the dividing line between them becomes blurred, and depending on how you interpret the course of the events, they may ultimately not be three different individuals.Considering the game (or not-game) strongly emphasizes the suggestive approach, excluding any specific details and concrete clues, I hardly see it as a puzzle to be pieced together. Through the looking glass, I believe Dear Esther is neither a search for an answer, nor even for a meaning, but an experiment with the senses and emotions. It is a lonely, guilt-stricken journey through morbidly beautiful emptiness; an emotive smorgasbord of sight, sound, implication and metaphor, aimed to generate a feeling of purposeful despair. The world is quiet, uneventful and subdued, the atmosphere isolated and melancholic, and one chapter in particular - namely the cave - might be the most strikingly beautiful achievement ever presented on a monitor.The only interaction Dear Esther provides is to look at it, to experience it. To react to what my own mind evokes in response by the emotional implications and occurring subtlety, not to on-screen prompts or physical reflexes. It is a lonely, slow 90-minute walk of purgatory dealing with sorrow, loss, shame, faith and sickness, but also love, hope and atonement. One look at the washed-out hillside, the empty and devastated houses, the constant twinkle of a distant radio mast, and the harrowingly lack of any other life whatsoever (except an eerie silhouette along the horizon and the occasional bird) tells me, however, almost all I need to know; the night slowly falls, and it falls with a sinister reason. The approaching call to that perceptible, mystery mast is inevitable.It is a simulator of subconscious introspection that pretty much can be associated with walking along an empty road along the coast at night and where your mind went at that time. But at the end of the day, Dear Esther doesn't need to tell me anything, nor does it really attempt to, despite the minimalistic events that is self-evident enough through implication alone; it only needs to make me feel something, and indeed it does. The meaning I create for myself, both early on and during the resolution, is more than that could ever be - yet it is nothing concrete or even describable. The devoid of clarity is strangely enough satisfying.Robert Briscoe's uncompromising game design combined with the dark, sensitive tones of composer Jessica Curry's rewritten soundtrack of haunting strings and piano, the island's quiet ambience and underlying emotional depth has the qualifications to profundly affecting the player.

												""You wake up on an uninhabited Hebridean island and all you can hear are voices in your head(narrated), like they're telling you a story, but you can't really figure out  if you're in a dream or reality? that something you just saw was a ghost or your imagination? am i dead or alive? perhaps i'm the ghost myself? is he telling me a story or he's reading letters to his wife?"" by far this has been one of the most amazing gaming experience ever, a pure GEM.

												When I first bought this game I assumed I was paying $1 for a forgettable horror survival game. Turns out I was very wrong but I was by no means disappointed, at least not when I finished the story. I was upset at first when I discovered what I had bought but I decided to give it a chance all the same. It took me a while to warm up to it but after I did it became one of the top 5 most memorable of my 133 Steam purchases. The soundtrack is so soothing and amazing, it was so good I put it on my iPhone. Combine the music with the amazing storyline and beautiful art style and you have a true masterpiece. I recommend this game to every one of my friends because I truly think anyone can enjoy Dear Esther. Don't think of it as playing a game, think of it as walking through a dream while awake. At least that's what it felt like for me.			",121,26,5,16,13,0,25

												Dear Esther is not a game for all, it requires an open mind to be understood and apreciated, it is a wonderful experience which brings memories about what happened to the Narrator (The player himself).The script are complex and the end will reveal the importance of this lonely and paranoid journey everything under a majestic soundtrack.If you will buy this (non) game you could take one of the most sophisticated works in the history of games, thinking about the many literary quotations, religious and contemporary chronicles that define the life of a man.

												The game featured stunning visuals and was a story beautifully told in a number if different ways that let you draw your own conclusions but definitely lacked it what could of been a more interactive experience. I was forever intrigued listening to the protagonist just tell his story and i think that alone is worth experiencing this game. Simply beautiful. The only downside i really see to this game is that it is very short, those familiar with story experience style games like this will know to expect that, but to others a hour will only leave them disappointed.

												A game taking place on a deserted, dismal Hebridean island, housing a peculiar, unobtrusive wandering, promptly sounds like the concept of an experiment. Given the complete absence of interaction between the player and the game, as the nameless player's protagonist without visual identification strolls through the mist, while the release of random sound recordings of letters read out loud to a woman named Esther, it is indeed in fact an experiment. The identity of the woman is unclear, as is the relationship between the two of you; however, as you progress through the windblown beaches, the moors, the deep caves as well as the lighthouse - towards the peak of the island - detached diary notes depict the outlines of a tragic accident, and a ghostly tale appears.The story of Dear Esther is utterly obscure and abstract. Cryptic biblical quotation is occasionally displayed on the surroundings, and out of the sound recordings the history of the island surface, along with the hints of a freeway, the disclosure of a fatal car crash, and three personalities; a shepherd with syphilis, an explorer whose infected wounds made him mad, and a broken man with guilt involving the mentioned car accident. However, the dividing line between them becomes blurred, and depending on how you interpret the course of the events, they may ultimately not be three different individuals.Considering the game (or not-game) strongly emphasizes the suggestive approach, excluding any specific details and concrete clues, I hardly see it as a puzzle to be pieced together. Through the looking glass, I believe Dear Esther is neither a search for an answer, nor even for a meaning, but an experiment with the senses and emotions. It is a lonely, guilt-stricken journey through morbidly beautiful emptiness; an emotive smorgasbord of sight, sound, implication and metaphor, aimed to generate a feeling of purposeful despair. The world is quiet, uneventful and subdued, the atmosphere isolated and melancholic, and one chapter in particular - namely the cave - might be the most strikingly beautiful achievement ever presented on a monitor.The only interaction Dear Esther provides is to look at it, to experience it. To react to what my own mind evokes in response by the emotional implications and occurring subtlety, not to on-screen prompts or physical reflexes. It is a lonely, slow 90-minute walk of purgatory dealing with sorrow, loss, shame, faith and sickness, but also love, hope and atonement. One look at the washed-out hillside, the empty and devastated houses, the constant twinkle of a distant radio mast, and the harrowingly lack of any other life whatsoever (except an eerie silhouette along the horizon and the occasional bird) tells me, however, almost all I need to know; the night slowly falls, and it falls with a sinister reason. The approaching call to that perceptible, mystery mast is inevitable.It is a simulator of subconscious introspection that pretty much can be associated with walking along an empty road along the coast at night and where your mind went at that time. But at the end of the day, Dear Esther doesn't need to tell me anything, nor does it really attempt to, despite the minimalistic events that is self-evident enough through implication alone; it only needs to make me feel something, and indeed it does. The meaning I create for myself, both early on and during the resolution, is more than that could ever be - yet it is nothing concrete or even describable. The devoid of clarity is strangely enough satisfying.Robert Briscoe's uncompromising game design combined with the dark, sensitive tones of composer Jessica Curry's rewritten soundtrack of haunting strings and piano, the island's quiet ambience and underlying emotional depth has the qualifications to profundly affecting the player. Game scientist and lecturer Dan Pinchbeck, who originally created the game back in 2008, has proved that violence and puzzles and logic are not necessarily required. The narrative alone can be just as essential.8.5 / 10			",293,91,5,3,4,0,2

												Dear Reader,I’m writing to you today for I wonder at the thoughts you would think, and the words you would utter, if you could see what I have seen. Hear what I have heard. Experience what I have experienced. Would your thoughts and opinions mirror mine as Narcisuss’s visage was reflected back to him from the water of a pool?Or will my thoughts be as a cherry blossom falling to the ground? Seen but lost among the countless number of facsimiles. Remembered for a second, but forgotten and swept away for all eternity.I wonder…Dear Esther is an interesting experiment. It is a game devoid of action, violence, sex, and interaction of any kind. You are on a deserted island with a disembodied voice for company as you explore. No more and no less. Or so it would seem.As I wandered over the island, the voice read excerpts from a letter to a woman named Esther. Over time, I began to wonder about Esther, the voice, and two men named Donnelly and Jakobson. All are mentioned frequently throughout the game yet there is much that requires explanation.The game uses Valve’s Source engine, which continues to hold up well despite its age. The island might be devoid of life but the views are lovely if somewhat grim. As I made my way to a lighthouse I observed rolling hills of grass, walked along a beach, spotted derelict ships beached upon the shore, and saw other sights. There is a section of the game where I found myself in a cave that took my breath away. Stalactites, stalagmites, glowing objects, gems, waterfalls; this area has easily become one of my most memorable locations for a video game.To read the rest of my review visit Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-dear-esther/ ",344,72,5,59,47,3,79

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Dear Esther 

			Views: 2,207		

			A review of Dear Esther by Senior Reviewer Trent Dear Esther is available on Steam for $9.99 Be sure to subscribe and comment! You can follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/analogreviews		

Opening with your in front of the Lighthouse with your character delivering a soliloquy, after which you are left to explore your surroundings. There are no objective markers, no text prompts, no intrusive and hideous HUD to obscure your view of the world. Exploring the nooks and crannies of the surrounding area occasionally prompts random statements from your character. In these letters are few of the Island's former inhabitants are referenced repeatedly. There are also several themes that emerge from these excerpts and astute players will notice those themes reflected in the environment. A glowing red beacon on top of a radio tower is almost always present and, like a moth to a flame, is compels you to seek it out. Paths split and merge around the island and it's easy to find your way forward. This set up wouldn't be engrossing for very long if it wasn't for the visuals. Dear Ester benefits from an excellent graphical presentation and art direction. Textures are rich, dust picks up, leaves blow around, the foliage is dense, and landmarks dot an otherwise open landscape. Warm candle glow contrasts with cool night skies and somehow Dear Esther manages to make caves, often the most drab environments found in games, rather breath taking. Rock walls are scrawled on with luminescent goo, and the rocks form awesome structures with stalactites and stalagmites jutting from the bedrock forming nefarious teeth. Rivers flow through the cave's interior terminating in grand waterfalls. It is perhaps here that the game's setting can be most clearly seen as a metaphor. To deride Dear Esther for it's lack of actual gameplay is to remain oblivious to it's excellent adaptation of literary devices to tell a simple interactive story. It's a story that places you not just in the shoes of the protagonist but in his mind and soul. Its an introspective tale which is remarkably rare for a video game. To discuss any more of the plot would undermine the experience and the mystery. Allegory, allusions and metaphors are all present. Dear Esther explores new territory for narrative in an interactive media. With it's lack of a defined structure and a devilish desire not to be too explicit with its plot points Dear Esther's yarn will displease some an accusations of pretension will likely ensue.   There have been games in the past with exquisite narratives and there have been games that have extraordinary gameplay and mechanics. The biggest challenge is getting these two aspects of a game to work together harmoniously—to have game mechanics that fit into narrative themes. Mechanics and gameplay elements that reflect the subtext of the narrative itself. In many games story and gameplay exist in almost separate bubbles. Actual narrative often bookends levels and takes a backseat while the player controls their character. It's an antiquated formula that only a handful of games seem to have shaken. The way The Chinese Room engages the player without traditional mechanics is through simple exploration. By making discoveries in the world you are treated to a bit of exposition. Symbols, diagrams, and writings can be found in the world to reflect elements of the exposition. A book or film could never deliver the level of immersion that Dear Esther offers. The experience only works because the player can choose to see or not to see things in the environment. The ability for the player to set the pace of the story and be given the opportunity to discover the details makes Dear Esther work.Dear Esther has had a remarkable journey from Half Life 2 mod to independent release. It's an exercise in adapting literary conventions to an interactive experience and it's an exercise worth taking part in. The excellent soundtrack and visuals hold your attention while the plot takes shape. The conclusions will stick with you long after the hour and a half it takes to see it through and it's likely that you will want to revisit Dear Esther to soak in it's finer points.

I generally detest walking simulators but when they're as pretty as this one and the story is told in such a David Lycnhian manner, I am inclined to give it the Thums Up rating.

												Ever noticed how, very occasionally, you will play a game, listen to a piece of music, watch a movie or whatever, and you know, as soon as you've finished that it will stay with you for a long time?I'm getting that right now.I've just played through Dear Esther twice and I find it to be time and money VERY well spent.This is not a game in the conventional sense.If your fix is usually space marines shooting aliens, this might not be for you. It is very unorthodox.It has no enemies, no other characters, no items, no object interaction at all. All you do is walk and explore as the back story unfolds through often dreamy monologues.But therein lies its strength. It really does try something different, and it pays off.It really is beautiful. It's a couple of years old now, but if you crank the settings up to full it really shines. This is due in large part to the actual art direction and creation of the island setting. It looks very natural with no copy and paste going on and it all takes place in dusk or night time so it looks moody and washed out.Seriously, take time to look around at the scenery.The sound is completely perfect and enhances the experience no-end.The musical score is haunting and perfectly timed to coincide with epic scenery or other happenings. The narrator (the only voice in the 'game') does an excellent job as well.It's a strange thing that a game in which you do so little can have such an impact, but that really is the case for me.This game is as beautiful/haunting/mysterious as it is unorthodox.It won't be for everyone, but if you are open to something different, put those headphones on, turn out the lights and go for a walk :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The whole game is filled with beautiful poetry and is a visual masterpiece to say the least. Not everyone can appreciate this game the way me and my friends did, I found it to be more like a wonderful book than an open world exploration game. Also If you are the kind of person to dive into the meaning behind metaphors and poetry, then this game may oddly have a lot of replay for you since every playthrough has a slightly different narrative. Overall I found the game to be a very moving experience.That and there are god damn ghosts.			",183,46,4,17,26,1,17

												Dear Esther is a really wonderful experience. I wouldn't call it a game, per se, since it involves no problem solving and very little active user interaction. Really it's a unique use of interactive media as a storytelling device. You walk through the setting to trigger narration and to progress between chapters. The graphics are gorgeous, the atmosphere is exceedingly lonely and evocative, the music is good, the writing and narration wonderful... It adds up to a beautiful, tragic, and slightly surreal exploration of grief that is worth the price of admission.			",7,17,0,2,3,0,0

												In this game you can't jump, run, or hold/use items. Actions like crouching and using flashlight are automatic. Generally the only thing you do is walk. You walk a lot. This makes whole game pretty boring.It has some nice views (especially in 3rd chapter) and music, but lack of any kind of actual gameplay, and strange, obscure story, makes it a material for a slideshow, or maybe movie (not very good one actually...), but definitely not for a game.

												This isn't a game in the truly technical sense... It's more of a metaphysical walk-through-the-countryside kind of thing. Don't go into it expecting to solve puzzles or shoot zombies 'cause it just doesn't happen. Really pay attention to your surroundings and listen to the monologue 'cause it's the key to getting something out of the experience.			",342,152,0,65,30,2,39

												I really wanted to like this game, but it just fell short of my expectation.  I was hoping that it would more of an emotional type of game, but I just didn't feel anything there.  I personally thought that I'm more of a sensitive type of person, that I can be emotional if I let myself to be.  Perhaps my heart was made of stone the day I played this game(or maybe I should have played the game with lights off,  and with some wine and scented candles, then maybe...just maybe...I might like this game.)I can tell that the developer focused all the effort in the writing/narration, game environment and the presentation of the game.  I admit that the writing of it is beautiful, combined with as beautiful game environment. However, I felt that the game is trying too hard to be poetic or artistic.  And in my humble opinion, I think it was a bit too pretentious.  In fact, I don't think I have play any other game that actually made me feel this way.One of the other things that I didn't like about this game is that there is no instant or manual save option. I understand that this type of game is best to be played in one sitting, but it is still nice to have that option.  The first time I played this game, I played about 20 minutes. I got to a different area in the game, it was after the loading screen; and I had to stop playing the game, thought that it had auto-save. But it didn't auto-save, so I had to play the game from the beginning again.  So the next and last time I played this game, I had this constant unpleasant feeling behind the back of my mind, wondering when this game is going to end, and hoping that it would end sooner; because I sure don't feel like starting the game all over again.There are only a few things that I like about this game.  I like the atmosphere of the game; I enjoyed walking around the seaside, cave...etc.  Some people complained about the walking speed being too slow, but I thought that the speed is just fine for me. I also like the soundtrack, suits the game very well.  For a first person POV game, it was a good thing that they  actually added controller support, that's another minor thing that I appreciate.All I can say is that this game is still a good enough experience for me.  So, l won't say that I want that couple hours of my life back; but overall, I won't say that I recommend this to everyone.			",247,124,17,38,22,5,37

												Dear Esther: I tried to see you, at the end. The island is capricious; as like a siren, she lures hermits to seek the inaccessible--trapping them in waters that ignore the swim key. I have spent hours drowning in search of you. I am drowning in you, still.Dear Esther: At last, night has fallen, and I have caught sight of the moon. I shall follow its light, that it may lead me to our reunion, and to my end.Dear Esther: I have fallen between a ramp and two rocks. Esther, do you remember that time I got kidney stones? Or how I never learned how to climb rocks or jump over things as a boy? I am pinned. Oh, to be ruined by so trifling an obstacle.I'm afraid this is it. I was to become an aerial for you, but the island's designs wouldn't allow it. Esther...goodbye.			",85,29,1,9,3,0,11

												In this game you can't jump, run, or hold/use items. Actions like crouching and using flashlight are automatic. Generally the only thing you do is walk. You walk a lot. This makes whole game pretty boring.It has some nice views (especially in 3rd chapter) and music, but lack of any kind of actual gameplay, and strange, obscure story, makes it a material for a slideshow, or maybe movie (not very good one actually...), but definitely not for a game.

The beautiful environments and the ghost story makes up for the lack of gameplay, it's almost more like a movie. Although when it comes to concepts like these (and there are but a few) less is more in my opinion. It may seem short but since dialogue and other parts of the game are randomized, you may get a different feeling the second playthrough.

												While this is more of an interactive story than a game, it is well worth ""playing"", if only for the amazing scenery and breathtaking soundtrack.  The story is intriguing.  It isn't perfectly elucidated but leaves the interpretation to you.  As you discover notes, locations, and clues, you will learn more of the story bit by bit and in a different order depending on how you explore the island.  This changes how you may interpret what's going on.  It's fairly short and will only take a matter of a few hours depending on how much you stop to gawk at the landscape.  It's a poignant piece of art masquerading as a game and my only regret is how long I waited to get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are no bad guys to kill, obstacles to dodge or jump scares. The only button aside from movement is ""zoom in"". If that's a deal-breaker, this isn't for you.I got completely lost in the atmosphere of this game. After playing it for the first time, I immediately played it two more times back to back. Each time there were different voice-overs and changes to the environment of varied significance.The environment is immersive and expresses the mood throughout. As for ""gameplay"", the story itself is the game. You have to interpret and piece it together, and the game won't walk you through it or tell you if you've won. Maybe it's not a ""game"", but whatever it is, I wish there were more.			",455,222,11,22,84,7,85

												Had been intrigued with this ""game"" for some time. Having played and liked Gone Home, I thought it might be a similar kind of atmospheric game. But read some reviews where people called it boring and pointless. I'm into this kind of artsy stuff but to a certain limit only! At the point when art starts to become self-indulgent I get put off, be it films, books or games. So basically, was on the fence about buying it and finally couldn't resist picking it up for very cheap as part of a Humble Bundle. Dear Esther had been sitting in my library for a while now. I had a few hours to kill today so finally decided to check it out. First 10-15 mins, I was like ""Uhh...this is going to be a little boring. Where do I have to go? There are so many paths and routes. Is there any marker or any maps to show me the way? Do I just stare at the vast ocean and the foliage throughout the game? This is confusing!"" I have to admit that initially I was beginning to see what all those bad reviews by gamers meant about it being just a walking simulator. Even so, an hour later I found myself still playing and completely in awe of the game's atmosphere especially the gorgeous cave section. And the music...oh god, the music is mindblowing! I think its the music that really sets the mood for this game. In fact, its not really a game in my opinion...its a journey...a piece of interactive art. If you go in expecting to play a game...you will hate it! But if you let yourself be taken in by the environment its trying to create for you...you will have a mesmerising experience.I simply cant get that hauntingly beautiful soundtrack out of my head. And the part where you fall into the water and see images of a motorway and a couple of cars...that part blew my mind! Everything is just done so well. The detailing, the character building, the lighting, the environments...its pure art!Bottomline, I know many people thought of it as pointless and a waste of time - but I really enjoyed it. I would like to try out some similar stuff and am open to recommendations. The Stanley Parable is next on my list...that demo I played was just fantastic!			",94,25,5,2,5,0,3

												Can't possibly recommend it at this price. It's a 2 hour linear walking simulator through some rather pretty scenery, accompanied by (at best) average prose. It just tells you to shut up, walk, and listen for 2 hours straight while it drones on and attempts to tell the story in the most roundabout way possible to fill in the time it all takes. As a free mod that was done as an experiment, I can see the appeal of this, but as a $9.99 ""game"", I expect more.There is no interactivity, no puzzles, no important questions that it asks of you. It's just dull.			",214,59,0,49,35,2,55

												Be aware - This is not an action packed thrill ride.  Nor is it a graphical marvel.  It is not a multiplayer extravaganza, nor a brain draining puzzler.What it is - Its a heart wrenching story, written masterfully and with a light touch.I have read review after review, saying that they 'wish they hadn’t wasted their money'.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  While it is not the most graphically advanced of games, it is not about how pretty it looks, or whether it contains that ""new fad"" that’s going around in the gaming industry.This is a game that crosses many boundaries.It assumes that you have a brain (something that is in short supply these days).  It also assumes that you will figure things out on your own.There are no superfluous controls, there is no need.  This is a story.  When you accept it as such, you get swept away on a tide of emotion.  I think this is the intention of the developers.  Allowing yourself to feel what the writer(s) feel is the whole point.The graphical game is not the 'story', it is the vusual cue that provides a more visceral sensation to the 'story'.If you dont like a good novel, you wont like this game.I personally think it is spectacular.  I recommend this story to anyone who has a heart.  You wont be sorry.Easily a 10 out of 10.			",179,42,5,29,24,3,48

												Dear Esther was an interesting art project and not muxh else. There is no real gameplay to speak of other than walking through the world itself (at a snails pace I might add), waiting to hear nonlinear pieces of the plot.  It's short at about only an hours length, though you might be able to get a little more out of it by exploring every nook and cranny. Though there is no reason or incentive to do so as there is nothing to collect or achieve other than hearing other small snipets of the story.  And even that is diminished by fact that the story itself is simply not that engaging or interesting.  Overall, Esther has many interesting components but  ultimately fails to bring them together into a meanful experience.			",421,125,8,74,73,8,84

												Dear Esther breaks so many gaming stereotypes. Your character doesn't grow stronger as the game progresses - the game doesn't even have a levelling system of any kind. It doesn't require lightning reflexes to dodge that impossibly fast saw blade or platform your way across a valley littered with spikes. You don't get to kill anything or destroy stuff - the game has no enemies to speak of. You don't get to construct mega cities or craft up a storm of items. You don't get to roleplay either - there is no customization, no assortment of loot, no impulse to power level or item grind.What then, does Dear Esther let you do? It gives you space to think, provides you with the opportunity to reflect. It encourages you to take a stroll (quite literally) down a path few have travelled, and piques your curiousity with a brilliant unfolding of the plotline by the nameless narrator. Your path is often carefully crafted out for you - I was initially disappointed with the lack of alternate routes, given the wide expanse of the island you find yourself on. But eventually, that was washed away by the excitement that was quite simply ""Hey, that's where I want to go, too!"" in response to the game's subtle tugging on my sleeve. The score and the accompanying concise commentary complete the audio-visual sensory overload. The grand, vivid surroundings - especially the excellent usage of space and scale - are the perfect juxtaposition to the nagging feeling of loneliness and sense of longing.Very little is explained (the repeated cryptic chemical/electrical scribblings on the walls definitely do you no favours), and probably even less is ever concluded by the time the journey ends, but unlike most adventures, Dear Esther does not seem to be too concerned with finding a solution; it is not rushed into making conclusions or finding meaning. Instead it is very content in simply existing. Some claim Dear Esther to be nothing more than emotional manipulation, and I find that rather unfortunate. As much space as Dear Esther can potentially create, like all content with emotional investment, the return you get out of it depends on the amount you are willing to put in. No two players will get the same experience from playing this, and this is the strength of Dear Esther - a game which allows you to create a journey, an adventure, and meaning for yourself.

												Dear Esther is a game of art and emotion driving exp. The game may not have any goals, other than walking around and figuring out what is going on; but the game takes you on a journey of wonder. The game has simple controls, you either walk using the arrow keys or WASD keys, and the mouse to look around. You can click the mouse button to zoom in on detail but other than that, that is it in controls.There are 4 levels in this game, and each level is a story. Everytime you play the game, more random storylines are told, so the replayability is high. This game could be called a narrative game. It is a great work of art via audio and visuals. Each level is done so beautifully it takes your breathe away. I love just playing the game slowly, listening to the audio and enjoying my time in the world. This game might not be for everyone, because all you do is walk, listen, and enjoy at your own pace, but it is fun and the art talent is very good in this game. It is by far my favorite game.

												Not my cup of tea personally, the trailer made it look like some spooky adventure game, however all it really is, is a very well done up island with a man narrating his story. Quite interesting and gets you interested immediately, but there is no action and no threat so I've grown quite bored of it quickly.Great if you love it, nothing wrong with that just not my cup of tea, is all.

												How can anyone seriously even call this a game? You just control a camera (that I can't even call first person because there isn't anyone there) through an obvious pre-made path while a random voice tells you a boring story as you pass some triggers. There is absolutely no interaction with anything. No matter what definition of game you use, Dead Esther won't fit it.I honestly think the designer has no idea what's the difference between a game, a movie and a book.			",262,50,6,21,37,3,43

												Dear Esther. It seems like I've been walking here for a while now. It's been an hour, and my journey is nearing completion. Nothing has happened in the past hour, except for a shallow story. My feet grow weary, and so does my brain. This island is boring. Why did I come here?Why did I spend $10 bucks on this Walking Simulator?I can enjoy a well made ""game"" that is like this, but the fact is, it isn't a game. I'm sorry, but pressing the W button for an hour just doesn't seem compelling to me. I don't care if the visions are beautiful, there's nothing in the game.			",440,128,21,40,38,1,35

												Quite decent graphics, a confusing but yet captivating story and an amazing soundtrack. This game was really worth the few bucks on Humble-Bundle and I was surprised by the overwhelming atmosphere that this game creates. Especially the place where it takes place is catchy, the developers created such a beautiful island that it feels like you are on the real Hebrides. Though I was amazed by this games depth, I would not recommend this game to everybody: It is not like any other game, its a new concept of entertainment and those who like action and seek adventures wont like this game as much as those who like to try something new and enjoy a good story over action or extreme graphics. Its quite short (I think it was something like 2 hours) but its like reading a good books combined with a journey to the Hebrides (at least thats what I thought after playing it).

												This game is based on a mod that I have not played, so for the purposes of this review it will not be considered.While it's easy to criticize the gameplay (a word that hardely applies to this game) or the linearity of Dear Esther, this completely ignores the focus of this game, which is story telling and exploring. While the exploration is somewhat limited and definitely pre-determined, the atmosphere and visuals are so well done this hardly matters. During the game, the player finds himself so captivated by the contrasting bleakness and vibrance of the world and it's atmosphere, that he finds his every action and every thought hinged on the next line from the narrator or the next scene, dissolving away the percieved limitations which are so often used to criticize this game. If you are looking to get more out of your game experience, a step above the typical ""shoot-kill-earn point"" mechanics that are so popular in today's games, I'd recommend Dear Esther. Otherwise your better off with one of the more popular games which stimulate neither the mind nor the imagination.			",111,9,4,5,14,1,8

												First of all, understand why a lot of (if not most) negative reviews exist: People don't comprehend the game.This is one of those games that you don't play, you live it.It requires emotional sensitivity to grasp its content, and specially its intent.Yes, it is only walking through beautiful places, but that's not the point.This game is a journey, not only on your computer screen, but also a personal one. Open yourself to this game and you'll understand it, but most important, you may understand yourself.I strongly recommend this game for all those who face depression and understand its nature.

												This game is very odd. It certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. I definitely enjoyed it and felt it was quite beautiful.It's a game in which you explore an island and slowly piece together somebody's memories. Whose memories these are, why you're on this island, what things the narrator is actually talking about are not explained outright. It will stick in your head for days after you finish it, but I really like that.It's not stupid, but it does try a bit too hard to be clever. I'd rather that than stupid though. While there are some very helpful ideas online about the story of the game, I'd heavily recommend not reading those until at least a couple of days after you finish the game - I really enjoyed making my own mind up about things. Though it was certainly good to experience another person's take on things, and I was able to incorporate some other things into my experience.So it's not at all a traditional game. There's not really much challenge to it at all. An interactive story would probably be about right. But it's very pretty and very sad, and I found it enjoyable if a little too try-hard. Not for everyone though. If you want a short thinky experience, I would definitely recommend giving this a go.			",190,85,2,14,9,2,17

												As a game... this is not a traditional game. The closest that you are likely to come to this might be a highly scripted narrative RPG module. As a work of interactive art, it is beautiful, haunting, slightly disturbing. I am told that multiple playthroughs reveal more of the story. Perhaps I will try someday, but for now a single experience was enough. It's like watching a melancholy, but well made, movie.			",138,69,0,24,10,2,34

												 I'm relieved to see Steam add a negative reviews option just so I can bash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this ♥♥♥♥ing game.  Well, ""game."" Dear Esther isn't much of a game, it's more like reliving a painful school trip where your legs hurt like♥♥♥♥♥♥ the guide was a boring ♥♥♥♥, the teacher wouldn't stop asking questions and your crush didn't show.  Many people will say this game is beautiful. Many people will say the voice acting and the writing is superb. Many people have incurably bad taste.  While some of the visuals in this game are alright, it's nothing special. There are a lot of indie games that do a far better job of establishing an atmosphere. Hell, if you want to look at pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're better off jerking your eyes over a modded TES than this thing.  On to the story and the writing -- it's ♥♥♥♥ing drivel. There's nothing enjoyable in the monotone voice acting, nor in the workaday lines being read. Whatever they tried to accomplish, it failed; quite miserably.  The two monumental issues that plague this game however, are its linearity and the speed of progression. For the most part, you're stuck trudging down the same track like a moron. That wouldn't be so positively mind-blastingly painful if you weren't forced to walk at the same ♥♥♥♥ing speed throughout the entire game. I mean even using the word 'speed' in this paragraph seems wrong, it's like roleplaying a ♥♥♥♥ing slug caught in some lab experiment while your edgy teenage owner is practicing his reciting for the drama course.  Please, kill me. I don't want to risk even having to watch this being played ever again.  Monumental thumbs down.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're expecting an interactive experience, don't play Dear Esther, you will be disappointed. There is no combat, no puzzles, no NPCS, no skill trees, no multiplayer, no buttons, levers, or computers.. not even a door to open.However, if you are interested in hearing a great story and seeing gorgious environments then you will love this game. The game would be best described as visual storytelling. You walk around a quiet and mysterious island. As you walk around you will hear well written and spoken narration of the story as it unfolds the further you explore. These bits of narration often coincide with any landmarks you happen to be near. While sometimes it can be tedious trying to walk around some of the larger areas due to the slow movement speed, for the most part the environments will keep you engaged. These environments are jaw-droppingly beautiful, in particular the caves caused me to walk around saying ""whoa"" with every new room. To think that they managed to harness this level of beauty out of the Source engine is nothing short of amazing.Overall, the game will only last you about 1 hour for a playthrough, but it's definitely a must to experience at least once.

												Dear Esther is not a game. It is an interactive experience. It's also quite depressing and - despite some beautiful visuals - quite dull.More of an art experiment, ""Dear Esther"" has you following in the footsteps of a would-be suicide as he mournfully regrets the loss of his deceased wife. It's neat how the game randomly picks parts of the narrative to play  to you as you wander the moors; no run through will get exactly the same experience. Unfortunately, that narrative is dry and uninteresting. The moors are pretty but there's nothing to do there except marvel at the graphics. And the end is entirely predictable. Frankly, I'd have been better off just looking at the screenshots. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to admit that at first I hated this.  So much so that I uninstalled it and never gave it another thought.  Then I read a review where someone said they hated it, but they gave it antoher try.  Yes, the game is different than anything I've played before.  I have nothing to compare it to at all.  All I can say is that it does take a bit to get into it, so don't write it off.  I will say the only thing I disliked is the fact I couldn't run.  When I go off exploring I would have liked to have been able to run back to where I left off instead of being penalized with a slow trod back.  I found myself hitting up youtube to save myself some time instead of exploring due to not wanting to break up the story by going the wrong way.  Aside from that, the music is amazing.  The scenery is stunning.  The story is.... well, I'll let you discover the story on your own.			",249,47,2,23,14,3,10

The story felt like it was trying too hard to be artsy, and became rather self-indulgent after awhile. The only aspect of this game that I really enjoyed was the graphics, which - I must admit - were quite pretty.If you've heard of Dear Esther and the idea of a game like this interests you, I would suggest playing Gone Home instead.

												It was quiet when it ended, I was quiet. I looked back to the beginning of the journey, how uninterested I had started and how mundane it all seemed. Bright colors and a light splatter of words with so low context that I deemed them forgettable. How it changed as I continued, each selection of words put a hook on me. A light hook that went unnoticed, as unnoticed as the lack of freedom I deemed I had. Such a lie, a notion dispelled slowly as visual clues and words finally intertwined in a dark quiet crash. I understood halfway what this journey was, what it represented and what I would depart it with. I let it take me by the hand, surrendering to the journey. It was guided by rails, like street lines silently stating my bounds. It was quiet when it ended, I was quiet.

												This is a story. Not a game, not something that will bring you excitement, but more a sad solace. It will kick you and break you until you're little more than a shivering wreck of tears and sobs. And it's amazing. I still can't get over how riveting it was, and is, to play.Now for the game review:The actual ""play"" of Dear Esther isn't much. You walk at an unusually slow pace around a mostly linear path until the end, with little interaction by you. So, yes, it lacks there. If you want to speed up the gameplay, you can use the normal Source debug commands to quicken your pace. I suggest watching some gameplay videos to see what Dear Esther is like, and if you can stand it.I personally loved the story. Many people, however, can't connect with it. The whole plot revolves, at first glance, around an unnamed author of spoken letters to an ""Esther,"" who was apparently killed by a drunken driver named Paul. The lines between these characters start to blur, and some details are mixed, until an obscure, hard-to-understand message formulates. I won't say more, as I suggest you find out for yourself.You'll need an open, hard-working mind, a high level of patience, and the ability to draw your own conclusions when you take that Hebridean stroll that is Dear Esther.

												Looking for a rush of adrenaline, a mental challenge or a sense of accomplishment for saving the country/world? Look elsewhere. Being the contemplative and moody type, not very adept at people, this very short walk on a deserted island felt like an enjoyable little world of my own. The blowing of the wind, the reflections on the water, the solitude; indeed a very personal haven.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, most people who play games these days are not like me, and may feel bored by a game like this. I should also say that this almost isn't a game, per se, due to it's lack of actual interaction with anything. I would define it as a simple walking simulator with a great story, beautiful music, and amazing visual art & graphics. If you're an artsy person, or someone who appreciates art, then you will enjoy this game. I hope to see more of this style in the future!			",602,204,14,52,30,3,28

												This is a great, short, enthralling game. Well-written, excellent soundtrack, preconception-busting (unless you already have an opinion about the game, which you probably do). One complaint: for a game that depends so much on walking to trigger audio exposition, it was awfully hard to tell where to go next. That much aimless wandering didn't really fit the story the game was trying to tell. Still worthwhile, though. More games like this please!			",145,68,0,18,10,1,19

												More a visual novel than traditional video game, the description of Dear Esther being a ""walking simulator"" is probably apt.  But I found the (admittedly strange) narrative engrossing, and the pairing of the wonderful soundtrack combined with the excellently created cave sections were well worth the price of admission for me.  If you want action of any kind, steer well clear of this, but if you just want something intriguing and artsy, this is worth the hour it takes to finish.			",68,49,0,17,3,0,11

You walk through it, listen to it, and follow the story through occasional narration. It is a true work of art, both a visual and literary masterpiece, with gorgeous scenery and interesting, if a bit grim and sad story you're left to interpret on your own.

												It was quiet when it ended, I was quiet. I looked back to the beginning of the journey, how uninterested I had started and how mundane it all seemed. Bright colors and a light splatter of words with so low context that I deemed them forgettable. How it changed as I continued, each selection of words put a hook on me. A light hook that went unnoticed, as unnoticed as the lack of freedom I deemed I had. Such a lie, a notion dispelled slowly as visual clues and words finally intertwined in a dark quiet crash. I understood halfway what this journey was, what it represented and what I would depart it with. I let it take me by the hand, surrendering to the journey. It was guided by rails, like street lines silently stating my bounds. It was quiet when it ended, I was quiet. I looked back to the beginning of the journey, how uninterested I had started and how mundane it all seemed.			",87,23,0,16,3,0,2

The exploration, such as it is, is where the interactivity comes in, and some of the surrounding visuals are interesting, but ultimately the game seems to fall short of what its initial goals were.Dear Esther is divisive, and is honestly almost worth playing just to see what the controversy is all about, but if you're going to get it, wait for a sale.

												This game was both simultaneously interesting, enraging, and absolutely baffling. Having spent exactly an hour to get to the end, I'm conflicted as to whether or not I actually enjoyed the experience. Your surroundings become increasingly odd and surreal as you progress through the 'story,' with the tidbits of narrative you trigger forming most--if not all--of the plot involved. These are more or less random as to which you recieve, so how much of the story you actually have at the end, regardless of how thorough you were, can vary in each playthrough.Unfortunately the game provides no way of tracking how many events you've witnessesd/triggered, which is what puts me off from replaying. Unsure as to whether I have half of them, or 1% of them, I don't want to slog through several more hours of walking just to repeat the same (admittedly excellently narrated) blurbs over and over again.By now everyone has heard that it is THE walking simulator, and I'm just echoing that when I say you... just walk. There's limited interaction, and by limited I mean you have the ability to look at things. That's about it. There are some definite 'creep factor' moments in the game, but they're often distant and easy to miss if you aren't looking for them. That said, if you get it cheap or free, or this sounds EXACTLY like the sort of experience you want to have (and it does make you think, which I believe is a good thing, so surrealist fans might flock here) go for it. I wouldn't pay full price for it, however, as neither the gameplay or visual designs provide much that you can't get elsewhere and better.			",93,90,0,26,16,0,6

												This is a beautiful game that keeps you thinking and wondering till the end, as you explore the island you learn about a story about a couple and their journey together. There is no shooting or puzzles be had, there is nothing that is really a challenge in this game, all you do is explore and enjoy the scenery that is around you. The graphics and physics of the plants and movement of the water is amazing and very well done. The music is relaxing and peaceful to listen to. The story is captivation and makes you want to know more. The game of Dear Esther has a very nice pace to it. It is calming and doesn't take long at all to beat. I highly recommend this gem to anyone who wants a change of pace and wants to just walk around and look at things while hearing a story. This is a great game and I've really enjoyed it from beginning to end.			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,477

												So Dear Esther was a game that I had not heard of until I saw several YouTube personalities tear it to shreds as a miserable narrative walking simulator. They weren't wrong. That didn't stop my curiosity though and I picked up the game anyway for about a dollar or so.Don't buy this game. When I first started I was honestly enthralled; I set it up on my surround sound and just observed and listened. It was like being able to see a book, which you would think would be pretty cool. Well I made it to chapter 2 and decided I need a break (holding ""W"" for 2 hours was taking it's toll) and I left the game. When I came back, there was no save file. Every time you start the game you have to go from the beginning. In the menu there is even a chapter select menu but they never unlock even after you reach the chapter.The story had lost me anyways, this book that calls itself a game isn't even worth a dollar.

It would have been better as a short video. You have to look deep into the story to fully understand it and appreciate it as it is very metaphorical. So if you like that sort of thing, by all means buy it, but for those of us looking for a gaming experience to go along with our story, look elsewhere. I'm glad I got this in a bundle.

I find it to be a thought-provoking experience, one I can play every so often, lines changed for a new experience.Don't expect any answers in this game, because there are none, only questions and statements for you to interpret however you wish.Not for everyone, but I would greatly recommend it.

												This piece is art first and game second.  It is that simple.  If that bothers you then do not complain or tear it down, just go some place else.  This game achieved what it set out to do and that was put poetry to a game engine.  Multiple play throughs brings out different dialogue and different story bits.  It is best enjoyed in one solid play through, set aside, and returned to for another some time later.  Relaxing, evocative, and still brain teasing this is one of the best gaming experiances I've ever had.  10/10 will come back again.			",153,67,0,10,4,2,7

												Not quite a game but a neat expericne none the less.  Just make sure you know what your getting into.This is one of those ""Art"" games where the point is more to elisit a reaction rather than deliver a full gameplay experice and if your into that sort of thing Dear Esther delivers.You find yourself on a deserted Island with no explination with who you are, whats going on, or what your goal is.  As you wander around a narrator will give you fragments of a strange tale at set loactions.  And thats really it.  Theres just enough story to make inturpertaion as to what happend and who you are but never straight out tells you.  The enviroments is at once lonely, haunting, and relaxing.  The music is pretty and atmospheric.  And you'll likely find yourself getting pulled into the game sort of like Myst minus the puzzles.  The game is short but doesn't overstay its welcome.I'm not sure if this ""game"" is worth the full release price but its gone down since its release and well worth grabbing during a sale.  Just understand what it is your buying.  If you want somthing different and layed back and enjoy experimental indy games that are more about light exploration and evocking emotion rather than game play, or if you just want to feel alone (and i mean that in a positive way) than give it a look.  If not you'll likely get bored really fast.			",224,104,1,29,12,2,44

												Not a game and terrible even as an exploration simulator. The interactivity with scenario and objects are inexistent. Hold W key until the end, follow the road with your mouse and listen to a story. Well, that's it. After a while, your finger will hurt a little bit and you start to wonder if there isn't an automatic way to keep walking. Your actions are irrelevant, as your ""interaction"" with the game. It's a movie where you press W to make it play forward.By any means - do not buy that. Do not play this. It's a waste of your time and money.It's a source o regret.			",144,24,2,13,6,1,17

												I love Dear Esther. The atmosphere matches it's haunting narration. I finished the game with the feeling that I'll be playing it again, to see if I left any secrets unearthed. I was filled with wonder looking at all the cryptic messages along the stony cliffs.  At times I felt uneasy and in awe, thanks in part to the music. The story which is narrated in form of letters is compelling, you'll feel engaged interpreting it.If you like walking sims or english literature I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The description of this game convinced me this was quite a change from the normal (which is what I usually look for in a game) types of adventure/exploration game, however I felt that the lack of any kind of interaction with the game world really spoilt the enjoyment of it for me. The visuals and music really helped to set the scene of the story, and created a superp atmosphere in which to walk around in, but for me it would have been better if there had been some kind of interaction involved, a few hidden items to find. The game is more or less a walk through movie, with an unusual storyline which to me didn't quite grab my interest enough.			",52,29,0,0,3,0,0

												Graphics are really nice. Environment and 'feel' of the game is well done (albeit cold). Dialogue can be hard-to-follow and uninteresting at times, but the ending makes up for it I suppose.If you are into eccentric indie games, than this is a more-or-less classic that you should try. Its short and worth the money in my opinon (even if only barely). Even better if you can get it on sale/in a bundle.For those that are not typically into eccentric/artsy indies, keep in mind there is no 'game' here - only exploration.			",565,163,5,75,79,8,72

												This game is very odd. It certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea. I definitely enjoyed it and felt it was quite beautiful.It's a game in which you explore an island and slowly piece together somebody's memories. Whose memories these are, why you're on this island, what things the narrator is actually talking about are not explained outright. It will stick in your head for days after you finish it, but I really like that.It's not stupid, but it does try a bit too hard to be clever. I'd rather that than stupid though. While there are some very helpful ideas online about the story of the game, I'd heavily recommend not reading those until at least a couple of days after you finish the game - I really enjoyed making my own mind up about things. Though it was certainly good to experience another person's take on things, and I was able to incorporate some other things into my experience.So it's not at all a traditional game. There's not really much challenge to it at all. An interactive story would probably be about right. But it's very pretty and very sad, and I found it enjoyable if a little too try-hard. Not for everyone though. If you want a short thinky experience, I would definitely recommend giving this a go.			",190,85,2,14,9,2,17

												Finally got around to playing this. I recommend playing through without the subtitles unless you really don't understand his accent. The text kept breaking the immersion for me. Visually very beautiful, and I recommend using some nice headphones and turning the lights down to get the full effect. Controls were very simple move, look, and zoom. I spent a little over an hour walking around till the end just taking everything in.Overall it was very interesting. I enjoyed the branching directions which always left me wondering if I should go back because I had missed something. There were also some various strange situations that gave me the impression that I was not alone. I kind of had an idea of what might happen at the end as the story felt it was shifting in tone but it still left things up in the air for the player to decide what the actual meaning was.Definitely recommend playing it once if you ever get a chance and have about an hour to kill.

												The island presented in Dear Esther is simultaneously beautiful and bleakly desolate. It sets the tone for rest of the game instantly, weaving a spell that hides the flatness of foliage and uniformity of every rock. The mystery inherent in the sporadic narration can't take the full blame for this witchcraft any more than the oddly stunning visuals or the sweetly melancholic instrumentation can as - over plucked heartstrings aside - very little can be pulled out of its impenetrable vagueness. The player is as hopelessly unable to effect change as the protagonist himself. There's no jumping, no crouching, no pressing of this or pulling of that; only endless walking. That's the height of input the player can provide; explore freely and listen as one random landmark or the other conjures a stray thought from the nameless protagonist. But as odd as it may sound, games with hundreds of pages of instructions leave behind less of a feeling of control than a game that won't even allow the player to turn on his or her own flashlight.

												Dear Eshter.It is my regret that I am incapable of writing anything nearly as beautiful as the letters meant for Esther. Letters stained in brilliant lines by the love poured over them from a man in grief.Dear Esther is a very slow burning story that many people would easily find to be dreadfully boring. But in the same length of time in which you could watch a feature length film, you can simply wander through overgrown paths on an island and traverse the gorgeous caves beneath. The scenery is stunning but empty except for some cryptic clues; equally as cryptic as the haunting narration that accompanies them.Rarely have I cared so much to understand an allegorical story. and never have I come out of one with at least three distinct theories as to its meaning, narrative, past, and conclusion. However, the most unfortunate aspect of trying to delve in to the deepest parts of the story is the inevitable realization that, unknowable details aside, the circumstances of the events are not very interesting; they just tug at a few emotional strings. One of the few things that sets Dear Esther apart from Proteus is the fact that there is a story and there are actually some things on the deserted island that garner attention.

												It's very hard to describe something which is not considered a game yet it claims to be one. Dear Esther brings up the whole discussion whether video games can be a form of art or not, I honestly believe I can but this case feels somewhat different for me. In Dear Esther the character you play as narrates an interesting and compeling story which comes with very great music, despite lacking most of the times. Not only that but you are able to witness some really beautifull landscapes and underground sections which probably were the most enjoying part for me. This leads to the a great question, is Dear Esther really a game? As far as I see it doesn't really offer any gameplay at all, you just walk around, it's basicly like watching a movie where you are the camera man per say. It's really hard for me to talk about these so called ""games"" but yet I think that Dear Esther offers a great and wonderfull experience, please do bare in mind that this is not for everyone.

So emotional that it strikes through your heart and leaves a scar...in a good way.The persons that contributed to this game have made a great work both narating and creating the levels and also has a great ambient sounds.Forget everything you will do in the next hours while playing this game and live the story.

												This was one of the most thought provoking experiences I've had in gaming. And before I say anything else, this won't be for everyone, this is not a conventional game, more an ""interactive"" experience. No spoilers but this game focuses everything on exploration rather than any sort of interaction, hence the quotation marks earlier. With that said, it is still an amazingly immersive experience. I started the game at midnight and finishing it just after 2am, yes I'm aware that that is a lot longer than most people took to finish this, but I walked around and tried to explore as much as I could. The graphics are pretty fantastic and the sound and music and lighting adds so much to the experience. This is a story driven game, and yet it is all up to you. The narration, which is very well done, only hints at things and it is up to you to make up your own mind about what is happening. 8.5/10			",335,187,12,28,20,3,14

												A full three seconds into watching the trailer, I determined I would perchase the work of art that is Dear Esther.The music of the trailer sets such a mood for the experience that unfolds, it is hard to imagine a game begining this good to be capable of stumbling in execution. And the product does not disapoint. The enviroment is exelent, as it must be to fill the void  left by any form of ""gameplay"" in this work of artistic sotrytelling.And Dear Esther must be clasified more generally than a game as a ""work of art"". To call it a game is missleading; a game is filled with game concerns, traps, puzzles, obstacles, and oponnents, and Dear Esther has only the obstecle of your enviroment, an obstecle which you have no ability to overcome, having not even the ability to jump. If you come looking for a game, you will be disapointed.And yet it is this simplicity of presentation that gives Dear Esther its most poignent value; it diverts, if you will let it, your attention from ""finding the right soloution"" to ""finding your own path to follow"". It confuses the audience at first, as you atempt to find the correct way to an assumed goal and realize that all the paths lead to the same destination. For example, whenever the game presents the audience with a new enviroment or vista, there is allways a rather obvious main path and several more or less secluded side paths. These will either eventuallly set the audience back on track or abruply dead end, often with a unique dialouge log at the end. But when one turns around in slight fustration that you will have to retrace the same path to get back on track, you realize that there is a second path back, diverging off in a different direction with new a new route to the eventual ending. Level design is Dear Esthers strongest virtue when judged as a ""game"", containing excelent and intuative, if slightly constaining, paths to the eventual goal.And this constriction is fine in a long and winding journey. Consider the Half Life series. When compared with an open world enviroment, the levels of Half Life are terribly constricting in their layout. They are intricate, but they are constrained to be mostly linear. The games overall, though, do not suffer from this lack of expansivene options becaues of their extensive length. The alternitive form is to have a shorter direct story but a larger and much more open world to tell it in, as games like Skyrim do.Dear Esther, though suffers on it's first playthrough becaues of its length. The game is over far too quickly, leaving the audience with the feeling that it might have done so much more with the world it set up. It is almost fustrating to think about how much bigger the game could have been, how much more could have been explored and experienced, how much longer the game might have been.To understand this feeling, consider the construction of the Stanley Parable. Dear Esther shares many charachteristics with that more popular title, Nonlinear sotrytelling, a seemingly short storry on fist playthrough, and an omnicient narrator talking to a powerless player. The differences lie in the execution of each. The Stanley Parable focuses on the concept of choice, of free will, on examining through repeated playthroughs the nature and impacts of choices the player makes. Dear Esther is a game wholy absorbed in it's story, in atempting to pice together the charachter of the narrator, or even if the narrator is only a single person. Over it's short playtime one constantly rediscovers the core of the game, which evolves rapidly as the story progresses. Many complain of the game being too long and borring, but I think it suffers from just the oposite. It is incrediably short if played straight through, leaving you with almost a sense of disapointment that you did not get more out of it, just as when you play the Stanley Parable following all the narrators instructions for the ""happy"" ending. To truely enjoy Dear Esther, leave no path unexpored, no audio log unheard, and play againBut while the Stanley Parable is comic, Dear Esther is dramatic, which is a great deal of why many dislike the game for being ""slow"". It is the same reson many dislike 2001: A Space Odyssey for being ""slow""; you must look harder to discover the meaning. In the same way that for some the ending the 2001 is ""disapointing"" for being anticlimactic after the buildup of the last part of the movie, so is the end of Dear Esther ""disapointing"", for the most profound part of each is the jouney, not the destination.It is incredible to jouney through Dear Esther, and while you may be left wanting something more than the game provides, what it does provide it does exceptionally well. And prehaps this supports one of the many ideas the game hopes to imbune, that there is nothing more to tell of the narrator's storry, for there will always be mysteries that cannot be unraveld.After the game's ending, which is as suprising as everything else in the jouney you have been on, the game fades to black with the sounds of the sea, looping ever onwards, leaving the player to think about the voyage they have been on, and eventually realize that now they must press escape, select exit, and leave the world of the game for their everyday lives.In short, If you want a darker, more dramatic Stanley Parable, then this game is for you. If you appriciate ambiguity in your art, this game is for you. If you are interested in level design and game story telling, this game is for you. As long as you do not expect a game with gameplay concerns, and instead are content with an exceptional story of the struggles of the human mind told in a modern visual poem, this game is for you.

												Be ready, you W key is about to get rapped.Visually this game is incredible. Seriously. I was completely amazed by some places i saw. Some of them are currently my desktop wallpaper.The soundtrack is also great and together with the visuals make this ""game"" a really nice experience.The story makes no sense whatsoever on purpose, and i think is also a strong part of the game. You never know the full meaning of what you are seeing/being told. And that for me is good, in a way that the ""game"" is always making you wonder and assume things. The meaning for the story and things you see is the one you want to give to them.Now, the weak parts.Despite the good things i mentioned above, let's not forget that the game is extremely linear. You walk to where the game wants you to walk, that's it. You have absolutely no choice. (To press or not to press W it's not really a choice, is it?)I enjoyed the game overall, but i should not hide the fact that the game had some boring parts, where you are only asking yourself ""will this end anytime soon?"". Usually you are then given a new place to go and another piece of excellent narrative, that helps to obfuscate that, but you will probably feel bored some times.I do not recommend the game for full price, but if you catch it on sale, i would say to give it a shot.

												I was not engaged by the story, the most raved-about aspect of this game. The narrator has a fine voice, and delivers his lines well, but all too often the lines themselves are pompous and intentionally confusing.The game doesn't confine itself to normal rules, but offers you a chance to explore as you like. The trouble is, exploring takes far too long. Not being able to run or jump may serve an ultimate purpose, but I found it to be detrimental to exploring the island. Numerous times I wondered what was around a corner or up a hill, only to realise that invisible walls or faulty polygon detection would get in my way halfway through the journey and I'd give up.I do not have a problem with the length of the game in comparison to the price. However, I expect the emotional impact to be that much more potent. This did not deliver anything close to an impact.I would not recommend this game, but would definitely be interested in the developer's second attempt at a game.			",167,29,1,24,9,2,11

												Dear Esther is the kind of game you play entirely in one sitting, that feels short and that makes you question what you just experienced, but that leaves a giant mark on your appreciation of passive narratives and video games as an art form.In a way, each playthrough is different, as some parts of the story are chosen at random between a pool of possible happenings, but the core of the story stays the same in all playthroughs, which kind of make you want to play again and again to see what the other elements of the story end up adding to your understanding of what happened. The entire time the way you're supposed to go is fairly obvious, but at some points you have to explore a bit to know where to go. ""hile I'm not really a fan of linear paths, this one felt like it was deserved, as if the character you're playing know this path, has walked it thousands of times.The story in itself is something that's hard to describe and understand. If you look online, you'll find countless blog posts, forum discussions, professional and amateur analyses and theories about what really happened. Things like this make the game feel more like people describing and discussing themselves having walked through a book rather than be discussing a video game, and I mean this in the best of ways.If you're the kind of person who likes easter eggs as well, this game will fulfill that craving for you. There are things that if you aren't careful enough you'll miss, which add to the stories and the theories, and seems to be just as much a part of your experience and the narrative as the narrating.PROS:Great storyAmazing atmosphereTo this day the community is trying to understand the deeper meaning, you can be part of that community too!Beautiful scenery, you can tell the creators took their timeA sense of wonder I've yet to experience againCONS:Lots of downtime where nothing happensThe atmosphere can be very creepy at times, putting you on edge even though this is one of the calmest games ever.At some points it was difficult for me to know which way to go to advance the gameWould I recommend this?Absolutely. This game is one of the games that I will never forget in my life and that I will continue to mention time and time again.			",576,150,4,79,40,2,46

Minimal interaction. Still do not understand ithe plot properly. Could have been so much more.Verdict: Well worth £1.74, not worth £6.99. Glad I tried it.Recommended based on the above criteria.

												An interesting experiment that's more interesting for what it attempts to do than what it actually accomplishes.  Playing ""Dear Esther"" I couldn't help but feel like video games were taking a small step forward in terms of what they could do, which is admirable, yet the game as a whole never really stopped feeling like a disjointed story awkwardly slapped on to some (really, really, beautiful) level design.Still, the first silent film to start using camera pans and tracking shots wasn't that great either, so I'm ultimately more hopeful that ""Dead Esther"" will lead to better things than it achieves on its own.  And playing it really made me realize how readily adaptable some modernist novels would be to ""Dear Esther's"" style of first person gameplay (someone please loan me a million dollars so I can adapt Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse"" to the Source engine.  It would be AWESOME!).			",214,85,2,68,14,0,27

												Absolutely incredible... Assuming you can appreciate a more 'artistic' take on gaming. In truth there isn't much gaming here, it is more like an interactive movie... Or book. The game is a slow walk around a gorgeous island while an elequent, but verbose, narator reads from letters he will never send to Esther. The graphics are amazing (no teslation or anything but very high resolution textures and advanced lighting and reflection). The island is rendered beautifully and the story is interesting enough to hold your attention. The biggest down side is that I 'beat the game' in a little over an hour. I am pretty cheap, I buy almost everything on sale in Steam and somehow this was worth it at $10 for 1 hour.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is Dear Esther a good game?Since there are no decisions to make, nothing to interact with, nothing to win, and no way to lose - I don't think it's fair to judge it as a game when it's not even trying to be one.so then...Is Dear Esther a good experience?From purely audiovisual standpoint it's competent, but models and textures are clearly showing their age, and what little music there is sounds good but forgettable. If you were hoping to just wander around and explore - you'll only find yourself limited to a few linear paths, and even those don't offer much beyond some pretty vistas. There's little to find, and what you do find can't be interacted with in any way whatsoever.Most importantly, story (or something resembling it) is so fragmented and buried so deeply in metaphors that I couldn't make much sense of it. Perhaps it's truly something great if you figure it out; Maybe there's a deep message worthy of appreciation. Whatever it is - it's hidden well, and nothing about Dear Esther makes me want to keep looking.			",299,97,4,36,16,1,24

												All it is is holding down the w key and moving the mouse till you get told more of a narrative, and you move unbearably slow. This isn't a game. This is a software story. It is not fun. It would have been better as a short video. You have to look deep into the story to fully understand it and appreciate it as it is very metaphorical. So if you like that sort of thing, by all means buy it, but for those of us looking for a gaming experience to go along with our story, look elsewhere. I'm glad I got this in a bundle.

												Dear Esther is an ""art game"" where you play from a first-person perspective and explore a mysterious island. Unlike similar games like Gone Home, which actually let you manipulate objects, the only real interaction you have in Dear Esther is your movement through the environment. As you explore, a narrator occasionally speaks, each time adding more to the underlying story of the island, and helping you understand the journey you're taking.Dear Esther is one of those gaming experiences that you have to want to have to really enjoy it. The world is interesting and at times, truly beautiful. The music is haunting. And the story, ultimately, is worth the 1-2 hours the game takes to complete.			",195,84,4,15,30,3,41

												Something unusual - I thoroughly enjoyed it for the short time it lasted.You'll be exploring the island in a rather linear fashion - take time to stop & just look - there are some stunning vistas.  But the game's real appeal is the monologue, which is different each time you play (although the story themes remain the same).  It is delivered in pieces as you explore, leaving you to try to figure out what happened.  Some things are answered by the time you reach the end of your journey; some things are not.

												Edit: Alright, so I finished it, and it's much more interesting toward the end. The game gets off to an extremely slow start, but find your way around, get off the beach areas, and endure 'til later, and your experience will greatly improve. There's a lot more to see once you're off the beach. I wouldn't pay full price for this game, but if exploring games are your thing, you could give this a try.---------------------------One hour into the game:I guess it's pretty, if desolate, and the narrator has some poetic lines (once in a while, when you find where you're supposed to go), but the majority of my experience so far as been... frankly, uncomfortable. I find myself wishing that you could move faster instead of walking so painfully slowly, and it's extremely off-putting that you can't jump or climb. At all. At this point I feel like I'd jump for joy if I could just get to the top of this mountain. If you get lost easily like me, it's going to be difficult in the beginning. There's a lot of backtracking, and I'm not quite sure where to go, ever. The narrator is completely unhelpful when you're trying to figure out where to go next, and this self-guided tour is starting to feel pretty oppressive. I find myself desperately wanting to leave this abandoned beach.First-person exploration games are probably not for me, but if they're your cup of tea, it might be worthwhile to try this. If you're got an eye for detail and enjoy analyzing your environment to help supplement/piece together a storyline, maybe this is for you. As for me, I think I need more direction and structure in my games...			",45,16,0,6,4,0,4

												It is hard for me to explain exactly how much I disliked this game. For reference I enjoy exploration games and am more than familiar with the world of fine art and have a very high threshold for ""artsy"" things in general. I'm convinced that the only reason why this game got good reviews from so many people is because it's obtuse enough that they figured it must make them seem smart to say they liked it. The main character moves painfully slowly which wouldn't be an issue if the environment were more enjoyable. The addition of random statements that do not tie in with the environment actually take away from the game. Most of it seems like someone came up with some interesting looking areas and some cryptic statements and decided that throwing them together at random would be a lovely idea for a game. Every so often the statements will line up with the environment and there's a moment of clarity about what is going on. Unfortunately those moments of clarity were not interesting enough to make me care in the slightest what was going on. I think I would have enjoyed this slightly more if no one had tried to tell me it was good first. That and if the bits of dialogue were not randomized in an attempt to make it different or if they were written so that it pieced together better regardless of order. There are ways of making your audience work that are effective and enjoyable, this game doesn't use any of them.			",46,56,0,2,4,2,2

												I heard that Dear Esther was going out with Goat Simulator. She ended it when he couldn't get serious about their relationship. It's all good though. GS thought she was a real downer. Then she hooked up with The Stanley Parable but Stanly's such a tool. It didn't last.Last I heard, she was causually dating Slender: The Arrival. Two problems. Slender doesn't do anything ""causual"" and nothing ever ends well with Slenderman.Dear Esther is the famous un-game that aggravated not a few hardcore gamers when it was first released. You follow a man around a desolate island while he talks to himsef about Esther, the love of his life who sadly,  is no longer among the living.As the ""story"" unfolds, you find find yourself wandering though a maze disguised as an island. It is not uninteresting, as is the story the sad man tells as you explore. That's the problem. I could only describe this as a story-driven game as not uninteresting. When, at the end of Dear Esther, a voice whispers, ""come back"", I could only reply: ""no thank you"".I give it two out of ten polyesther chemical diagrams.			",40,23,0,13,1,0,1

Nothing has happened in the past hour, except for a shallow story. My feet grow weary, and so does my brain. This island is boring. Why did I come here?Why did I spend $10 bucks on this Walking Simulator?I can enjoy a well made ""game"" that is like this, but the fact is, it isn't a game. I'm sorry, but pressing the W button for an hour just doesn't seem compelling to me. I don't care if the visions are beautiful, there's nothing in the game.			",440,128,21,40,38,1,35

All I can say is that it does take a bit to get into it, so don't write it off.  I will say the only thing I disliked is the fact I couldn't run.  When I go off exploring I would have liked to have been able to run back to where I left off instead of being penalized with a slow trod back.  I found myself hitting up youtube to save myself some time instead of exploring due to not wanting to break up the story by going the wrong way.  Aside from that, the music is amazing.  The scenery is stunning.  The story is.... well, I'll let you discover the story on your own.			",249,47,2,23,14,3,10

												If you're expecting an interactive experience, don't play Dear Esther, you will be disappointed. There is no combat, no puzzles, no NPCS, no skill trees, no multiplayer, no buttons, levers, or computers.. not even a door to open.However, if you are interested in hearing a great story and seeing gorgious environments then you will love this game. The game would be best described as visual storytelling. You walk around a quiet and mysterious island. As you walk around you will hear well written and spoken narration of the story as it unfolds the further you explore. These bits of narration often coincide with any landmarks you happen to be near. While sometimes it can be tedious trying to walk around some of the larger areas due to the slow movement speed, for the most part the environments will keep you engaged. These environments are jaw-droppingly beautiful, in particular the caves caused me to walk around saying ""whoa"" with every new room. To think that they managed to harness this level of beauty out of the Source engine is nothing short of amazing.Overall, the game will only last you about 1 hour for a playthrough, but it's definitely a must to experience at least once.

												Dear Esther is not a game. It is an interactive experience. It's also quite depressing and - despite some beautiful visuals - quite dull.More of an art experiment, ""Dear Esther"" has you following in the footsteps of a would-be suicide as he mournfully regrets the loss of his deceased wife. It's neat how the game randomly picks parts of the narrative to play  to you as you wander the moors; no run through will get exactly the same experience. Unfortunately, that narrative is dry and uninteresting. The moors are pretty but there's nothing to do there except marvel at the graphics. And the end is entirely predictable. Frankly, I'd have been better off just looking at the screenshots. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 I'm relieved to see Steam add a negative reviews option just so I can bash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this ♥♥♥♥ing game.  Well, ""game."" Dear Esther isn't much of a game, it's more like reliving a painful school trip where your legs hurt like♥♥♥♥♥♥ the guide was a boring ♥♥♥♥, the teacher wouldn't stop asking questions and your crush didn't show.  Many people will say this game is beautiful. Many people will say the voice acting and the writing is superb. Many people have incurably bad taste.  While some of the visuals in this game are alright, it's nothing special. There are a lot of indie games that do a far better job of establishing an atmosphere. Hell, if you want to look at pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're better off jerking your eyes over a modded TES than this thing.  On to the story and the writing -- it's ♥♥♥♥ing drivel. There's nothing enjoyable in the monotone voice acting, nor in the workaday lines being read. Whatever they tried to accomplish, it failed; quite miserably.  The two monumental issues that plague this game however, are its linearity and the speed of progression. For the most part, you're stuck trudging down the same track like a moron. That wouldn't be so positively mind-blastingly painful if you weren't forced to walk at the same ♥♥♥♥ing speed throughout the entire game. I mean even using the word 'speed' in this paragraph seems wrong, it's like roleplaying a ♥♥♥♥ing slug caught in some lab experiment while your edgy teenage owner is practicing his reciting for the drama course.  Please, kill me. I don't want to risk even having to watch this being played ever again.  Monumental thumbs down.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An unusually well-polished example of minimalist game design, Dear Esther puts you in control of a dying narrator as he explores an abandoned island (as well as his own miserable past and the histories of those who walked the island before him). The voice-acting is top-notch, the writing is excellent (if a bit too heavy-handed at times), and the island's design nails the experience together perfectly, sending the mood from merely gloomy in the beginning to stunning and hallucinatory as time goes by and the pacing escalates. Unfortunately, it also tends toward a bit of directionlessness; particularly in the first chapter, I found myself doubling back after spending several minutes exploring a meaningless fjord or accidentally returning the way I came.The gameplay also suffers for this. Your controls are limited to the standard movement of an FPS title with no jumping, crouching, or running enabled. You can't interact with the world around you in any way beyond wandering around and a simple zoom function you can activate with a left mouse click. Oh, and I suppose that there's a Don't Commit Suicide button (Q) which you can use to swim to the surface after ""accidentally"" falling into the ocean. The near absence of gameplay is necessary to the story, really, but it still felt as though it hurt the overall experience. All the same, it's absolutely worth playing if you feel like filling a couple hours with something different for cheap.			",378,151,4,79,48,3,74

												Dear Eshter.It is my regret that I am incapable of writing anything nearly as beautiful as the letters meant for Esther. Letters stained in brilliant lines by the love poured over them from a man in grief.Dear Esther is a very slow burning story that many people would easily find to be dreadfully boring. But in the same length of time in which you could watch a feature length film, you can simply wander through overgrown paths on an island and traverse the gorgeous caves beneath. The scenery is stunning but empty except for some cryptic clues; equally as cryptic as the haunting narration that accompanies them.Rarely have I cared so much to understand an allegorical story. and never have I come out of one with at least three distinct theories as to its meaning, narrative, past, and conclusion. However, the most unfortunate aspect of trying to delve in to the deepest parts of the story is the inevitable realization that, unknowable details aside, the circumstances of the events are not very interesting; they just tug at a few emotional strings. One of the few things that sets Dear Esther apart from Proteus is the fact that there is a story and there are actually some things on the deserted island that garner attention.

												It's very hard to describe something which is not considered a game yet it claims to be one. Dear Esther brings up the whole discussion whether video games can be a form of art or not, I honestly believe I can but this case feels somewhat different for me. In Dear Esther the character you play as narrates an interesting and compeling story which comes with very great music, despite lacking most of the times. Not only that but you are able to witness some really beautifull landscapes and underground sections which probably were the most enjoying part for me. This leads to the a great question, is Dear Esther really a game? As far as I see it doesn't really offer any gameplay at all, you just walk around, it's basicly like watching a movie where you are the camera man per say. It's really hard for me to talk about these so called ""games"" but yet I think that Dear Esther offers a great and wonderfull experience, please do bare in mind that this is not for everyone.

												This was one of the most thought provoking experiences I've had in gaming. And before I say anything else, this won't be for everyone, this is not a conventional game, more an ""interactive"" experience. No spoilers but this game focuses everything on exploration rather than any sort of interaction, hence the quotation marks earlier. With that said, it is still an amazingly immersive experience. I started the game at midnight and finishing it just after 2am, yes I'm aware that that is a lot longer than most people took to finish this, but I walked around and tried to explore as much as I could. The graphics are pretty fantastic and the sound and music and lighting adds so much to the experience. This is a story driven game, and yet it is all up to you. The narration, which is very well done, only hints at things and it is up to you to make up your own mind about what is happening. 8.5/10			",335,187,12,28,20,3,14

												A full three seconds into watching the trailer, I determined I would perchase the work of art that is Dear Esther.The music of the trailer sets such a mood for the experience that unfolds, it is hard to imagine a game begining this good to be capable of stumbling in execution. And the product does not disapoint. The enviroment is exelent, as it must be to fill the void  left by any form of ""gameplay"" in this work of artistic sotrytelling.And Dear Esther must be clasified more generally than a game as a ""work of art"". To call it a game is missleading; a game is filled with game concerns, traps, puzzles, obstacles, and oponnents, and Dear Esther has only the obstecle of your enviroment, an obstecle which you have no ability to overcome, having not even the ability to jump. If you come looking for a game, you will be disapointed.And yet it is this simplicity of presentation that gives Dear Esther its most poignent value; it diverts, if you will let it, your attention from ""finding the right soloution"" to ""finding your own path to follow"". It confuses the audience at first, as you atempt to find the correct way to an assumed goal and realize that all the paths lead to the same destination. For example, whenever the game presents the audience with a new enviroment or vista, there is allways a rather obvious main path and several more or less secluded side paths. These will either eventuallly set the audience back on track or abruply dead end, often with a unique dialouge log at the end. But when one turns around in slight fustration that you will have to retrace the same path to get back on track, you realize that there is a second path back, diverging off in a different direction with new a new route to the eventual ending. Level design is Dear Esthers strongest virtue when judged as a ""game"", containing excelent and intuative, if slightly constaining, paths to the eventual goal.And this constriction is fine in a long and winding journey. Consider the Half Life series. When compared with an open world enviroment, the levels of Half Life are terribly constricting in their layout. They are intricate, but they are constrained to be mostly linear. The games overall, though, do not suffer from this lack of expansivene options becaues of their extensive length. The alternitive form is to have a shorter direct story but a larger and much more open world to tell it in, as games like Skyrim do.Dear Esther, though suffers on it's first playthrough becaues of its length. The game is over far too quickly, leaving the audience with the feeling that it might have done so much more with the world it set up. It is almost fustrating to think about how much bigger the game could have been, how much more could have been explored and experienced, how much longer the game might have been.To understand this feeling, consider the construction of the Stanley Parable. Dear Esther shares many charachteristics with that more popular title, Nonlinear sotrytelling, a seemingly short storry on fist playthrough, and an omnicient narrator talking to a powerless player. The differences lie in the execution of each. The Stanley Parable focuses on the concept of choice, of free will, on examining through repeated playthroughs the nature and impacts of choices the player makes. Dear Esther is a game wholy absorbed in it's story, in atempting to pice together the charachter of the narrator, or even if the narrator is only a single person. Over it's short playtime one constantly rediscovers the core of the game, which evolves rapidly as the story progresses. Many complain of the game being too long and borring, but I think it suffers from just the oposite. It is incrediably short if played straight through, leaving you with almost a sense of disapointment that you did not get more out of it, just as when you play the Stanley Parable following all the narrators instructions for the ""happy"" ending. To truely enjoy Dear Esther, leave no path unexpored, no audio log unheard, and play againBut while the Stanley Parable is comic, Dear Esther is dramatic, which is a great deal of why many dislike the game for being ""slow"". It is the same reson many dislike 2001: A Space Odyssey for being ""slow""; you must look harder to discover the meaning. In the same way that for some the ending the 2001 is ""disapointing"" for being anticlimactic after the buildup of the last part of the movie, so is the end of Dear Esther ""disapointing"", for the most profound part of each is the jouney, not the destination.It is incredible to jouney through Dear Esther, and while you may be left wanting something more than the game provides, what it does provide it does exceptionally well. And prehaps this supports one of the many ideas the game hopes to imbune, that there is nothing more to tell of the narrator's storry, for there will always be mysteries that cannot be unraveld.After the game's ending, which is as suprising as everything else in the jouney you have been on, the game fades to black with the sounds of the sea, looping ever onwards, leaving the player to think about the voyage they have been on, and eventually realize that now they must press escape, select exit, and leave the world of the game for their everyday lives.In short, If you want a darker, more dramatic Stanley Parable, then this game is for you. If you appriciate ambiguity in your art, this game is for you. If you are interested in level design and game story telling, this game is for you. As long as you do not expect a game with gameplay concerns, and instead are content with an exceptional story of the struggles of the human mind told in a modern visual poem, this game is for you.

												Be ready, you W key is about to get rapped.Visually this game is incredible. Seriously. I was completely amazed by some places i saw. Some of them are currently my desktop wallpaper.The soundtrack is also great and together with the visuals make this ""game"" a really nice experience.The story makes no sense whatsoever on purpose, and i think is also a strong part of the game. You never know the full meaning of what you are seeing/being told. And that for me is good, in a way that the ""game"" is always making you wonder and assume things. The meaning for the story and things you see is the one you want to give to them.Now, the weak parts.Despite the good things i mentioned above, let's not forget that the game is extremely linear. You walk to where the game wants you to walk, that's it. You have absolutely no choice. (To press or not to press W it's not really a choice, is it?)I enjoyed the game overall, but i should not hide the fact that the game had some boring parts, where you are only asking yourself ""will this end anytime soon?"". Usually you are then given a new place to go and another piece of excellent narrative, that helps to obfuscate that, but you will probably feel bored some times.I do not recommend the game for full price, but if you catch it on sale, i would say to give it a shot.

												People have told me that this is a breakthrough in video game storytelling. Honestly, I find that incredibly insulting. Fallout, Planescape Torment, Chrono Trigger... These are what I consider prime examples of storytelling in video games. Something that takes the player into account, where not only are you the center of the game's world, you also have a say in its fate. Good interactive storytelling is just that; interactive. It should take advantage of the medium the author chose and how much potential it has to make something truly unique and expansive. Dear Esther squanders this in almost every way. It is a brief, bland episode of nothing but walking down a narrow pathway, observing the static environment as the author reads aloud his bad poetry. And yes, the poetry itself is bad, at least I think it is. If you think Dear Esther is good poetry, that's fine. I won't think any less of you for it. Just don't call it a good video game. It isn't one.			",191,31,0,24,15,1,18

												This isn't a game so much as an interactive work of art. The only thing you can do is walk around looking at things while you listen to the narrative. It's like walking around inside an audio book. The movement speed is frustratingly slow unless you hack the ini files (which you should).The story is very good and emotionally gripping. You won't hear the whole thing on a single playthrough. Each playthrough tells random snippets of the story, and the game leaves you to piece together the rest. This makes for fun conversations when you discuss the plot with your friends but there's not enough variety for more than a couple replays.Game length is about an hour, but there's enough content to stretch that out to two hours through a second replay. Worth playing for the novelty - there's not much else out there like this.			",404,137,13,41,55,6,68

												First off I want to explain I have no qualms about an experience/story like this.  My do not recommend stems from the content.The time you spend will vary depending on how much you gawk at the island, however any way you slice it there is only a bit over an hour of actual content.  There is no sprint, interact, or secrets(outside of side paths).  I'll accept the last two, experienced plenty of visual novels and books not to judge Dear Esther on the lack of gameplay.  My complaint is with the lack of a sprint or faster movement.  My time could have been half what I invested and still would have had the same takeaway.  All I ask it that you respect my time devs, avoid pointless grinds, backtracking, and slow movement if it is only there to force more time in the game.Anyways my conclusion.  Don't bother buying, but if you want to hold W and look at a island for slightly more than an hour be my guest.  The story is engaging enough, if not stretched and the world is nice enough to look at.			",778,237,17,99,69,9,140

												I have never, ever, never taken the time to stop and review a Steam game. Ever. After investing some time in this title, I felt the need to take time out of my hectic schedule to stop and comment on how exactly this game has changed my life.If you've played all the classic environmental/atmospheric games like Mist, 7th Guest, 11th Hour, Amnesia, and the like: don't play this title. I get it, the author is trying to be the black sheep; the yin to the yang of every day Steam titles. Sadly, this is an utter dissapointment. I am completely disgusted at the poor attempt that this game makes at standing out as a dynamic novel packaged in an immersing video game setting. I really wish there was something that made this title compelling or at the very least tolerable but there is not. Fortunately I got this during a Steam sale, otherwise I would petition my money back. Not even Esther herself could appreciate this atrocity. If you want a sub-par audio book, sign up for an account at Audible.com. There's no reason that you should bother spending your hard earned dosh on filth such as this.Do yourself a favor, purchase Telltale Game's ""The Walking Dead"" or ""The Wolf Among Us"" and be content with your purchase on Steam. Otherwise, if you purchase this title I look forward to your synopsis; your plea to prevent any other poor souls from wasting their funds on this trash. Dear Esther?

												I heard that Dear Esther was going out with Goat Simulator. She ended it when he couldn't get serious about their relationship. It's all good though. GS thought she was a real downer. Then she hooked up with The Stanley Parable but Stanly's such a tool. It didn't last.Last I heard, she was causually dating Slender: The Arrival. Two problems. Slender doesn't do anything ""causual"" and nothing ever ends well with Slenderman.Dear Esther is the famous un-game that aggravated not a few hardcore gamers when it was first released. You follow a man around a desolate island while he talks to himsef about Esther, the love of his life who sadly,  is no longer among the living.As the ""story"" unfolds, you find find yourself wandering though a maze disguised as an island. It is not uninteresting, as is the story the sad man tells as you explore. That's the problem. I could only describe this as a story-driven game as not uninteresting. When, at the end of Dear Esther, a voice whispers, ""come back"", I could only reply: ""no thank you"".I give it two out of ten polyesther chemical diagrams.			",40,23,0,13,1,0,1

												Dear Esther is more of an experience than a game.  And that experience is one where you will need to peel the onion to see what lurks below the surface.  The experience is rich in layers of perception and one which varies from player to player and even for the same player, if he or she repeats any of the chapters of Dear Esther.  Usually in a game we would expect some combination of: * A set of rules* Interactions with NPC's or other players* The ability to interact with the environment; e.g. pick up stuff, move things, shoot things, etc.* Quests* Achievements* In-Game RewardsYou won't find any of that in Dear Esther, at least not in the way you might expect, if at all.  Rather in Dear Esther you can only move along some fairly well defined paths using directional controls.  With a controller, the left stick is directional for  movement and the right stick is directional for view.  That's it. You can't pick up an item to examine it.  There is no interaction with any other player or any NPC's.  The only quest would be your exploration of the location following a linear path where certain points trigger narrator readings of text  in what is presumably meant to be letters to Esther, who may or not be real and who you never meet and who you suspect is dead, if she lived at all.So if this isn't a game, what kind of gamer would want to fire up Dear Esther and wander around to see what there is to offer in the virtual environment?   I suspect that there isn't any one personality type that one would have to be to enjoy this, but it would appeal most to a person given to introspection, who likes to patiently collect clues and peel them away to try to uncover the real story and not be particularly upset, if the answer is that there isn't necessarily an answer or that there are many answers that all may have some degree of validity.  In other words it is a mind game, if it is a game at all.  And one where you are left to try to discern meaning amid chaos and confusion in an imperfect world where your questions are not always answered.The experience runs between an hour and half to twelve hours depending on how fast you proceed and whether or not you go back to replay and see what you missed.  And yes, you can miss a great deal the first time through - either because it wasn't there in the first place or because you were tuned in to find it.  For example, there are as many as ten ghostly appearances and you may only see one or two the first time through Dear Esther.   I say this based on what I perceived in my playthrough and what others have reported in their playthrough(s).  The Celtic music is absolutely haunting and makes the game superb.  If you don't get goosebumps, you're not paying attention.  The visuals are stunning and the narrative readings are full of emotion and maybe more.  All of it works together to cause you to feel a lot of emotion while causing you to start asking more and more questions about what it is that you are experiencing.  So by now you are probably saying, ""What the heck kind of review is this?  You are talking in circles and driving me nuts.""  If so, I understand.  The answer is that this really isn't a game in the traditional sense and instead an experience where you are given clues in the environment and narration to piece together after which you are expected to use a healthy dose of imagination, layer peeling, and deductive reasoning to shape your own idea of what the story really is.In truth of it is that Dear Esther is one of those things where you may get more out of it by discussing it with friends and other players than by just playing it through. If you decide to have a run at Dear Esther, you might be well advised to constantly ask:*  Is what I'm perceiving real?*  Is there symbolism here?*  Is this place real or imaginary; e.g., is this a memory, a dream, some device, a real location, or some combination?*  Are the names of people given in the narration separate real individuals, creations of a fractured mind, representations of something other than a person, etc.In the end you may ask is this a simple sad story of withdrawl from the world and madness following the death of a loved one, or something entirely different?At this point I must apologize for a review that has taken longer to write than it took to run through Dear Esther itself.  So now it is probably time to close with a few thoughts.Dear Esther got me to put my thinking cap on and see many possibilities, which is sometimes a good thing.  And perhaps that's the point of Dear Esther to get people to examine perception and meaning.  I suspect that Dear Esther's value is more in the discussion than in the playing.If you do play Dear Esther all the way through and come out with more questions, than answers, I recommend a look at the guide at 


Dear Esther: Secrets and More 
A Guide for Dear Esther
By: mrmusicallion

			Although this game might be (far) less interactive than many - garnering criticisms that it is 'merely a walking simulator', there is more to Dear Esther than what many seem to recognise.

												Dear Esther is a somber promenade in the chronicle of a morbid lover -- an opaque, emotional, restless, slightly fatalistic fever dream, if fever dreams were ever digitized. It's not a videogame; there is no interaction, save for the narrator's cues. It's more of a semi-cinematic, semi-literary, three-dimensional painting for the player to wander semi-aimlessly. If you dispense with any notion of depth and allow yourself to be absorbed in the beautiful world (beyond question, the best-looking application of the Source engine to-date), Dear Esther provides a truly unique experience for the jaded appetite.

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, and there was a little part in the middle that was memorable, but the rest of game (which clocks in at about 60-80 minutes, depending on how much you explore the hallway the leveldesign is.) was not very embracing.There is no gameplay except walking and the story is told by a single VA. The game is not bad, but overpriced as hell.In addition no replay value at all.Buy at own risk.			",74,21,0,11,1,0,3

												Imagine a real-time 3D version of Myst, except the environemnt isn't as interesting, there is no real story, the only action required by the player is that they follow the intended story path without trying to get too creative, there are no puzzles of any kind, and some dreary, bitter-sounding british guy talks incessantly and cryptically about something that happened in his past that he is apparently upset about.I hated this, and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. If for some reason you still give a ♥♥♥♥ about this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and plan to play it, I guess I should warn you that there are spoilers ahead.This game is such boring, pretentious, fart-sniffing crap that I have difficulty organizing my thoughts about it. Anyone who tells you that this game is creative, revolutionary, ground-breaking, or ""worth playing at least once"" is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing moron who you should probably avoid talking to ever again. The visuals are bland and repetitive, as there isn't much on the island, and the graphics are dated (think HL2 on medium). There's no real story, unless you count the ramblings of a depressed british guy. Apparently the VO is semi-random, but never changes enough to lend the game any replay value (an impossible feat anyway, since the game has no value in the first place). As you progress through the game, it may or may not be vaguely hinted at that the depressed british guy is upset about his girlfriend having been killed by a drunk driver. In the end you kill yourself by jumping off of a radio tower. In true fart-sniffing form, just before your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character does the world a favor by pancaking at terminal velocity, he turns into a bird and soars away (?!?!?!) as the music gets all dramatic and the credits roll. It's never really clear if you are the depressed british guy or what (does he just walk around this crappy island muttering to himself? Is he a voice in my head? Was he a bird all along? If so, why doesn't he just fly to the radio tower instead of wasting 2 hours walking there?). Honestly, the biggest problem this game is that it isn't really a game. The ONLY story progression occurs in the form of your character TALKING TO HIMSELF, the actions the player performs are boring, and don't contribute to, or in any way seem to relate to the actual story, which might as well just be a radio show since it's all told in voice-over as you hold the ""progress"" button until the game ends.  This game so completely misses the point (pick any point, it misses them all) that, like Star Wars Episode 1, I don't even know where to start telling anyone how seriously awful it is.

												This game IS really good and definately something different. It was amazing going through the cave system. I found this game incredibly immersive even though im not using an oculus rift. A few things that I definately think the game should have are;Head bob: It wouldve been a lot better with realistic movement. The way that your character floats like a ghost just destroys that incredibly realistic feel.Run option: I did like the slow movement when there were amazing features to marvel at, but at times when some of the scenery was repetative, it would have been nice to be able to run.Seeing your body: Seeing your body is less important, but i imagine with an oculus rift it wouldve made it creepily real.Notes: How about adding a few notes to find in the game? Adding even more depth.			",14,6,0,2,4,0,1

												This ""Game"" is terrible. The idea is to walk around, take in your surroundings and listen to some bloke read a few letters in the wrong order. After 10 minutes of walking around at about a 1 cmph, I put ""de_playerspeed 300"" into the console, which made the game a lot shorter, but not any better. The game is beautiful and well crafted, the sound design is nice, but the entire game and it's concept is entirely pointless and has no real reason to exist.It wouldn't be so boring if the game was actually open ended with random events happening etc. But nope.A game can be short and narrative driven and still be a blast to play, just look at The Stanley Parable. The Chinese Room can make an amazing game,  Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs has shown that, Lets just hope they stick to making horror games, cause that was some immense♥♥♥♥♥♥			",266,35,16,24,21,4,22

												A jaw-dropping visual experience that's sadly wasted by an extremely disappointing storyline followed by a catastrophically pretentious and insubstantial ending that lacks any real meaning. If you're looking for a good philosophical adventure with elements of exploration and discovery, I recommend you completely ignore Dear Esther and instead play something like The Stanley Parable or Alan Wake.The ""gameplay"" of Dear Esther (for me) went from a giddy awe-inspiring exploration, seeking clues and adventure within an incredibly immersive environment full of realistic atmospheric soundscapes, but slowly transforms into a tedious illusion limited by frustratingly erroneous boundaries compounded by the inability to run or jump or interact with anything.There was allot of potential for this to be an amazing experience that rewards exploration with a genuine philosophical mind-bending story, but I was sadly left with an abysmally hollow sinking experience made infinitely worse by a lackluster storyline and ending, which somehow manages to get even worse by drowning persistence and curiosity with a black screen that perpetually does nothing and goes nowhere.

												A pathetic attempt at profundity and a complete waste of time. To be clear, I love experiemental, explorative, and narrative games. Gone Home is great, I even appreciate The Graveyard. But Dear Esther is like someone got really high, read ten pages of Melville, and tried to write a novel in his style. When he looked and realized it was only two pages long, he decided to make it seem longer by dispersing two paragraphs at a time while you walk across a hill. The characters are nothing more than names, there is no emotion to speak of, and the mystery is answered by another mystery- why you even played the game at all. It is utterly without substance or redeeming value of any sort.			",95,14,1,8,3,0,4

But If you want a good laugh because of ridiculous dialogue that changes each time you play all while walking though beautiful landscapes and wallpaper art, give it a shot. It wouldn't hurt.

												""Dear Esther"" is not a game.  It's a demonstration in poorly designed camera movements.  There are only three actions you can take in this ""application.""  (1) Mouse-look around.  (2) WASD Movement.  (3) Right-button click to Zoom.  That is the entire experience.  You cannot manipulate anything in the game except for the camera and the story makes very little sense.  The entire experience is about enjoying the view and the narration, and nothing more.  This is not a puzzle game, this is not a first-person shooter game.  Spend your money elsewhere.I'm actually very disappointed in Steam for marketing this as a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a walking simulator. There's no way around that. I don't know why people call this an ""explotarion"" game. There's no exploration to be done, the game is as linear as anything can be, so you are not actually exploring but merely walking (very frustatingly slowly) across pieces of land and whatnot.The story may be ok, but I'd rather see it in a video. The game is extremely boring and all you want to do is finish it fast enough to stop your suffering (which becomes more painful than that of the protagonist). I, unfortunately, couldn't finish the game. I paid a little bit more than a dollar for this and I still feel it's one of the worst spent dollars in my life.If this game were to have any achievements it would only need one and that one should be unlocked just for installing and running the game (does anyone see the irony in ""running"" this game?). For those of you that can't run the game because it crashes at start, you are the chosen ones! Seek no more for solutions, for there's some sort of divine intervention wanting you to avoid the pain of playing this ""game"".			",223,53,9,16,14,6,13

												This game was an enjoyable experience, but it's length left *much* to be desired - my 1.3 hours of gameplay was completing the game in it's entirety AND exploring off the intended path only to find  nothing of value. While the story and environments were positively beautiful, it felt completely linear and narrative driven with little no action that can be considered ""gameplay"" and virtually no replay value. I got this game via a bundle online, and if you can as well I would say it would be worthwhile to play through it for the short but captivating story. Otherwise, I cannot recommend purchasing this game at it's current value of $10.			",190,52,4,34,15,2,26

												Dear Esther,I find myself wandering this metaphor for of my personality at one quarter speed, desperately pecking about my keyboard for a dash button, least a toggle to run. Lo, there is none. Like a frozen water hose beckoning to its spicket to writhe in freedom as though it where a snake in a sandbox, my path is locked in linearity. Oh how my heart aches at the thought of back tracking but a single step.I find myself growing paranoid, fearing the tepid sound of my own stair. Fear, causing me to spin about, nonexistent sword at the ready, like a cocktail waitress of low breed in a seedy club who felt a dactyl retraction on her posterior. For an instant, from the corner of my mind’s eye, I see a saber tooth stalking me. It is only when I have spun and became prostrate that I realize, I am not in Tamriel. For you see, dear Esther, I suffer an affliction of the soul. Post Traumatic Skyrim Disorder.Deep into the depths of the danky and dark I do dive. Driving like a drinking drunkard of a drunk driver doused with dreary delusions of deft direction. You see? It was not some guy who may or may not be me or you or someone we know! It may have been some abstract things such as the paint on the road that caused something that has turned me totally emo!Oh how I bore of this. Though the landscape it beautiful, like a popular actress to an affection starved, near sided pauper who increases the likelihood of the furthering of his lineage by the systematic decline at which is screens potential mistresses.. Alas, it is lacking in not the smallest of margins from compensation. I find myself lobotomized, autonomous. Being startled by the sudden outburst of my own pompous and over articulated voice whose only purpose seems to be the attempt at making the narrator sound superior to the listener in learning and culture. Taking simple concepts and over complicating them with a wondrous and not so whimsical weave of extra words. To say things such as my overly denied self-realized need to disregard those of the fairer gender whom would by polite social custom find me by the barest of criteria a potential suitor and dedicate my time and energies to acquiring and building the means for the business of collecting currency is copious sum.I find myself no longer looking for items or clues. No longer reading the scribbles of madness upon the walls of reality. The only emotion left in my numb heart is the feint hint of offense such a beautiful landscape has been defaced with graffiti. I do not even ponder what three eyed creature lit all of these candles I find in the caves who’s luster has long since been lost to boredom.. Wait! Yes dear Esther! I do long, oh do I have such a longing! Like a mopey drunk clinically depressed lemming swimming at the bottom of a glass of whiskey chasing Xanax bars that promise his salvation from this world he was thoughtlessly forced into, I look to the radio tower. Perhaps it would offer gravity enough acceleration to break more than my femur? Perhaps it would serve as more than a muse to my desire to return to my desktop and take a nap? Would my feet be fleet like yours Mercury? Would they dash from the highest point of that tower and deliver me to my sweet liberation of this beautifully rendered travesty?No, they would not. As I plummet to the sweet portal of freedom clad with granite below, I open my arms and smile a sweet smile as light hearted as a opiated ferret in a warehouse filled with small reflective objects that look as though they are valued highly by someone else. But a mere instant, an infinitesimal point in time before I reach Nirvana, the laws that govern our physical world of frozen energy take a 90 degree bend and hurl me over a miniature representation of the Gulf of Mexico ,filled with symbolic paper boats of discarded waste.Dear Esther, I am not even greeted by credits. Only the need to push every button on my keyboard until I find the magic one that allows me to end this game without having to tab out to task manager. ",151,49,2,59,8,3,32

												I know the game is supposed to be for the atmosphere and all, but the story is literally just walking around as a story comes out.  There's nothing to do but walk around, no puzzles to solve, nothing like that.			",84,40,0,14,9,0,5

												Dear Esther ReviewThis game is boring.This is a personal review, meaning if and how I enjoyed the game.  Although I give a blue thumb up I really didn't enjoy it.  It does deserve a thumbs up becuase it accomplishes what it intends to.  However that goal is simply boring.  I'd have more fun reorganizing all the loose files and documents in my room (which I really should get to), or you know, playing a better game.The first user-defined tag for describing Dear Esther:  Walking Simulator.  Really?  Us gamers are so afraid of lifiting our asses off our couches and seats we need a walking simulator?  Your character literally does nothing but walk around the whole game (and swim through water a few necessary times).  By walking I mean a crippled grandma kind of walk.  There is no picking up items, no environment interactions, no switches to flip, no vehicles to control, no jumping, no weapons, nothing.  Just press forward and walk where you need to.As you move forward there will be narration by a British guy.  I just finished the game and still have no idea what the hell he was talking about.  I don't know if it was the character you are controlling, someone who has been at the island before, if he is talking about someone who has been left back home.  There are messages on the walls here and there but they are so blurred and hard to read that I started to completely skip them at some point, having lost interest.  If I wanted a story I'd read a book.I'm not joking when I say I started to fall asleep playing this.  I kept having to jolt myself awake to trudge through.  The character you control walks horifically slowly.  Like, if you go into prone position in Call of Duty and go forward, even that speed is faster than what you control here.  If it is supposed to simulate normal walking, it fails miserably.  Though I haven't checked and really don't care to, I don't know of any achievements or collectables or anything.  Supposedly there are ghosts that wander around and you can see them but I'm certainly not playing again for that.I'll try to say good things about Dear Esther.  At least the soundtrack is good.  Of course the good parts only kick in every so often.  The rest of the time you'll be hearing minimal undertones of music or just plain wind and waves ambience.  It is more of an art than a game.  But it's a boring piece of art.  It's like if I present to you a nice painting, but chances are as much as you like the painting you don't want to stare at it for ten hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, before getting quick conclusions of my thumb down I suggest reading the whole thing 'cause I'm aware I'm writting a subjective view of the game and I'm sure that some of you will like it...... but that's definately not me. As you may have read already from here, this game can be called a ""walking simulator"" since ALL you have to do is walking through an island while a voice is reading some sort of diary on the journey. It's ok, I do not always play videogames to have a dynamic gameplay. After all, I strongly enjoyed games like Walking Dead or To the Moon, and they're not that far from this main idea. It's not the fact that you don't need to do anything in order to beat the game. It's the story itself. I might not be clever, but I haven't understood a single damned thing once I reached the credits. But anyway, I played this game with my girlfriend who enjoys these kind of ""conceptual-persona-ultra-indie video games"" more than me, and she was very confused too. I like complex stories where you might even need to surf the internet in order to get the whole thing, but... A WHOLE GAME!? I had to check EVERYTHING on the net to ensure myself that this game makes some sense. When you reach this point of ""personal game"" I'm not sure it should go on the public market. And after all, the story wasn't good at all. I believe that the ending itself was improvised since I've seen that not even the developers could give a proper explanation to that. The only nice thing you can rescue from this game is the graphics. Maybe. I wasn't surprised at all 'cause... what developers doesn't use that software?In conclusion: this game is 2deep4me. I enjoy difficult storylines but this was totally out of the context. Hopefully some of you will find its beauty because I really wanted to like this game.			",308,68,8,26,7,2,10

												This game is so emo that I felt like dyeing my hair black, not washing and only listening to nu metal. The game is incredibly slow, it consists of literally just walking around looking at things and SHIFT does not let you sprint. There is, in fact, no sprint option. I tried to kill my character several times to make it more interesting and the game simply did not let me.One of the few good things about this game is the graphics. It is incredibly pretty.If you are unemployed and have nothing better to do in life, then play this game. Otherwise, Barbie's Dollhouse Party will probably suffice.			",51,20,1,3,5,0,2

												Now Dear Esther was kinda strange to me. I thought the start was slow and a bit lackluster I wasn't sure what to think of it at the time. Later on when you fall into a cavern the game really picks up. It was a sad story about regret (I think) and I quite enjoyed it. The idea was interesting, the scenery was breath taking and the game didn't overstay it's welcome.6/10 I wouldn't say I hated the game but I wouldn't say I loved it. I liked it and if people who didn't like it and started calling it a ""Hiker Simulater"" thats fine I understand but if you are going to play this you best throw away all gaming staples you've come to expect.

												Not much of a ""game"" strictly since you basically do nothing more than walk around given landscapes and paths, but an intense experience if one can appreciate the above-average narrative, visual and atmospheric power it has.

												Pretentious purple prose spoonfed to you by a posh prick as you plod along a path between set pieces. Some people claim that this game's strong points are the elements of exploration in an unfamiliar place. The exploration though, is half-baked at best. It seemed like every time I tried to explore some intersting place in the enviornment, I was blocked by an invisible barrier and forced to slowly mosey across the landscape back to the predetermined path laid out for me.When you finally make it back to your designated walking route, your faceless british narrator will reward you by dryly reciting fragments of a series of letters written by him to Esther. Do you remember the people in high school who thought of themselves as poetic geniuses as they wote about their unique experience of angst. Remember how they tried to use a thesaurus to make sure they used the smartest-sounding words? Dear Esther's writers were clearly impressed with him, and made sure to imitate his style as they wrote this game.One of the things that bothered me the most is that, at no point in the entire game did I feel like I had any agency. I felt like my entire role in the game could be filled by a piece of metal weighing down the W key. There's nothing wrong with non-interactive storytelling, but it's not a very good choice when the very medium you're using has the unique enefit of interactivity. It's like if you went into a movie and fond out that the film you went to see was a motionless black screen with the sound of a british man reading a copy of ""Atlas Shrugged."" It's certainly ""avant-garde,"" but I wouldn't call it brilliant or enjoyable.I feel like I need to say that I don't hate walking simulators in general, if only to appease those who say I'm just not ""patient"" or ""sophisticated"" enough to enjoy the genre. I also feel  that it's ridiculous that some reviewers have turned to these low blows against others for the sake of this game. I don't think that people should have to ""prove themselves"" before their opinions and criticisms are valid.Dear Esther is not a game to be played and enjoyed. It's a game to smugly discuss and mock those who are just too simple-minded to really ""get it.""			",82,24,0,14,6,0,7

												Dear Esther is, quite simply, the most beautiful and moving game I have ever played. You can feel the bitter ocean wind from the moment you step on the island. Every step of the journey is masterfully detailed and filled with the depressing personality of the island. The story may be confusing at first, but it's overwhelming and engrossing. The music is brilliant, and the caves are beautiful. The story snippets are also randomized, and there's an alternate ending, so be sure to play it more than once.			",169,62,2,14,15,2,18

												Not so much an interactive game as an exploration into tragedy, loss and grief told through one man's journey across a desolate, Hebridean island. Dear Esther is more like a form of slow and very intentional interactive art, akin to viewing a captivating painting where you're suddenly allowed to step inside the frame and experience the scene in its entirity as you desire rather than be confined to just one perspective.The story is conveyed in fractured pieces of spoken memory of old letters - or possible delusion - and left to the player to construct for themselves as different readings are presented at specific points along your journey, the semi-random nature of these readings meaning multiple playthroughs are required for them to be fully imparted to you.Touching and visually captivating in equal measure, Dear Esther is a brief yet nonetheless poignant example of how the medium of gaming is more than capable of producing beautiful and contemplative works that can provoke great emotion, backed by a strong musical score setting the perfect wistful tones to accompany the bleak isolation and inward reflection of the journey. If you have the interest and willingness to explore such things then this will reward you greatly.			",556,395,8,24,44,5,52

												Boring.The game looks gorgeous, but that's it.The gameplay (or lack of) is just walking around. No sprinting or running, just walking. Wanna move faster? You can't (unless you use cheats). This, in fact, punishes exploring the environment, because going away from the path, or trying a different path (not that are many, the levels are very linear) means more time wasted walking around.EDIT: I totally agree with TotalBiscuit, I had the same feelings as him while playing Dear Esther.

												Dear Esther is an excellent demonstration of the immersive storytelling virtual worlds can achieve. It combines magnificent visuals, a subtle, yet powerful soundtrack and stellar voice acting to tell a very touching story that explores darker themes like regret, grief and loneliness. It does so with a certain ambiguity which leaves one to ponder and theorize about the meaning of what has been witnessed long after the end. It is an impressive experience, but one I imagine not everyone can enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The environments are pretty, the narrative is mysterious and somewhat interesting, but it's so unstructured as to not really mean much. I'm a literature graduate student and I just couldn't find much meaning - the gameplay of walking around and navigating clunky terrain got in the way of really feeling much from the storytelling.

												IMAGINATION DELUXEIt is not often we gamers are presented with a slow paced adventure story. Most of the time, our games are about blowing up stuff or travelling to other galaxies, in ""Dear Esther"" we are forced, no - compelled, to follow the path of an unknown protagonist, and it is quite a nice adventure, if you dare to explore your own imagination.As we walk slowly towards a flashing beacon in the distance, we find clues here and there about previous encounters with the island we are on, and the narrative (a male voice), is seemingly addressing a woman who he is quite fond of.Most of the time the wind is our only companion, and the vegetation of the island. Sometimes we feel the presence of ""something"", but we are not sure what it is, and more often than not, we turn around to see if we are followed, only to realize we have to go on, no matter what...""Dear Esther"" is a short, visual novella, that will keep you enticed for an hour or two, but the real experience comes after you are done with the game, and you are left to wonder about three things:1.

I have read some people believe this to be an amazing story, but it's lost on me.  I have a hard time appreciating figurative works.  I understand the main story branch, but all the symbolism makes no sense to me.  It was like I was in high school english all over again.  I wonder if there are Dear Esther Cliff Notes?If you enjoy figurative works and have an hour to invest, pick this up.  Otherwise stay away.			",141,22,3,1,6,2,10

It is awesomely beautiful with the sound of waves crashing against the shore, wind blowing mist off the ocean, streams and waterfalls, and birds chirping. Wondrous caves to explore.  We all need quiet time in a safe place frequently. This is one of the places we can go.  The music is beautiful, along with the scenery.  The water is exceptionally well done.  It isn't healty for us to only play ""kill, kill, kill"" games.  We need to rest our minds and merely explore the lovely island to refresh ourselves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther is an aesthically pleasing, story-rich experience that is thoughtful, beautiful, and intriguing. It's not something that everyone is going to enjoy, as it is less a game and more of an exploratory journey used to deliver a narrative. The term 'walking-simulator' has been dealt out to ths particular genre of games and, while I don't really think that term is useful, it does attempt to give define a tag to apply to these games that offer its players more than just a wandering quest to complete. What Dear Esther offers its players is a contemplative work of art that left me thinking about the game for a few hours after completing it. It's graphics, voice-work, music, and writing all colate into a fine design that is worth taking your time to experience.I think that if I played too many of these games too often, or consecutively, I would grow tired of the genre as a whole, but they are something that I enjoy partaking in on occasion, and it's the same enjoyment that I find in reading a good book. The player awakes on an island and is left to their own devices to explore though there is a 'correct' path that will reveal more of the narrative. There are some interesting hidden elements in the game that are quite creepy, and the package as a whole is very well done.I'd recommend this game for those who want to enjoy an interesting and well told story within the interactive medium of a game. You won't find challenges, or riddles, or enemies to overcome, only a story that you can walk around inside at your leisure, discern yourself, and leave you to contemplate afterwards.

												Truly game of the year 2014. As much as I enjoyed other games such as Bioshock Infinite, the action in this game is BETTER. They really raised the bar. Sure you cant jump, run, or even kill yourself but really how important is being able to interact with your environment. The game has a GREAT zoom feature that will come in handy throughout the game. The game is full of twists and turns and you never know what will happen next. Great replayability, deserves a speed run. Reminscient of FIFA 2013 with all the custamization of Sonic 3. Really hope the modding community picks this title up, would really love to see additional skins on the cave troll. I can see how some people may not like it if they did not pick up the shotgun at the begining of the game. 10/10			",246,65,6,27,21,3,37

												Dear Esther is a beautiful, hour-long, melencholy, atmospheric, interactive story. The extent of your involvement in the game is pointing your first-person view in the direction you wish to move, while exploring the world around you and listening to the narrator. The exact story, itself, is open to some degree of interpretation and this is better identified as a story than a game.It's certainly worth playing through if you find it on sale. Alternately, this was originally a very highly regarded Half-Life 2 mod, so you can certainly pursue that option if you wish to play it.			",1460,602,62,239,213,17,275

The story is very vague, the voice acting shows little emotion, and the game is just over all boring. The only good thing was some of the scenery, the caves especially look really cool. I thought I would love this game because the story is usually what matters most to me in a game, but I was very disappinted.

												Nice looking, pretty good music, but walking simulators aren't really my thing.  The style of writing distracted more from the story than it added to it. The fact that it is purposely obtuse contributed to me not wanting to go through the game again to hear all of the letter fragments, I get the overall story of it as it is pretty simple, but adding more detail wouldn't make it any better.  If you are really bored and want a walking simulator this would be okay I guess, overall I found proteus more engaging though and would put that above this one.			",564,102,11,47,28,2,42

Nope, simply a man talking. All it is. If you like listening to someone talk, similar to that of a grandfather in the nursing home telling you stories about his life, then go ahead spend 15 dollars. Otherwise, there are plenty of quality games out there for a lot less.			",153,25,4,18,11,1,29

												Well, is this a game? If so, is it worth playing?To be honest: I don't know. Is it groundbreaking...I don't think so.Yes, it is a very nice way to tell a story, the grafics are very nice, the caverns are astonishingly beautiful, then again we are talking about a static world here, so it should look nice. The audio is spot on most of the time, the music, especially the piano is great.The narrator is just awesome.Unfortunately the story he tells is not. Basically Dear Esther is as if someone tells you a story and you can look around in the story he tells you.It is entirely linear, one has no option of interacting with the world whatsoever.It is intriguing and creates a nice atmosphere, but the story remains very very vague, nothing is explained, don't expect that some ""truth"" is unraveled in the end.Also I did not quite like the poetry-style of the narration, but that is a personal opinion. It does somewhat fit the whole situation though.Summing it up I would say that Dear Esther would have worked very well as the mod as which it started, but not as a full sized game.

												Can't really review this game, as it isn't a game as much as it is an interactive storyline.The entire experience lasts for under two hours, and to be honest, I wouldn't play it again. I wasn't completely engrossed, though I know some people were. The experience, to me, was a little boring.I guess the game depends on your mindset going in; you need to know that it's not a typical game. I knew it was going to be an interactive story, but I still didn't enjoy it much.			",88,19,2,13,8,0,9

												Starting off as a humble source-mod in '08, and later evolving into a wonderful and visually stunning gameplay experience. Dear Esther is a thought-provoking poetic ghost story of sorts with a powerful narrative and beautiful scenery that push the source engine to it's full granduer while still keeping the system requirements at a reasonable standard. As your journey across the island continues questions will arise, who is this man giving you such a compelling story? Am I playing as him or the Esther, the game's namesake? Who is that translucent robed figure dissapearing behind the rocks? Eventually these question increase in depth, which I refuse to share here as it would spoil the experience. While it is slow-paced and has a replayability factor of 1 or 2 times, Dear Esther is highly compelling and should not be missed, unless you have the attention span of a gnat, in which case go chase butterflies.

												While I discovered the Half-Life mod that was the original incarnation of this game many years ago, I did not own Half-Life, so I never got to play it. I'm glad I didn't.""Dear Esther"" is something that must be experienced this way. Stand alone. On its own. With some of the most staggeringly beautiful environments I've ever seen in a game, big names should stand aside: this game is pure visual emotion and poetry.Gameplay within ""Dear Esther"" is almost completely nonexistent. While some may say this declassifies it as a game, or makes it unenjoyable, I beg to differ. There is gameplay, alright; however, the gameplay is completely existential. To 'beat' the game is to uncover the story of Paul and Esther. To unwind the metaphoric and symbolic clues, to decode what we see and to piece together what we hear from the beautifully-written narration.I knew exactly what this game would be like when I saw it, and I loved every second of it. If you're a 'thinker', you'll love it too.			",133,113,2,17,13,2,11

However, it has a poignant story, very well done art and area design, and for the price of a movie ticket (or less, if it's on sale or in an indie bundle) you get something truly special.

												This is not a game. Not even close. It is pretty much what most generic brown game companies aspire to be, in that there is no gameplay, and the player has no choice in anything. He is put on rails, and walks around a boring, deserted island at a speed a paralysed man would be shocked by its lack of speed. The slow speed combined with at least 2 paths to most places means that more often than not, you end up going back the same way you came, and only notice after 5 minutes of drudgery, as the landscape is essentially the same throughout, apart from a few obvious bits. This 'game' is essentially made by someone who likes making models, and a guy who likes writing stories.Gameplay: -10/10Story: 5/10Ambiance: 2/10Can't really do any other scores, as there is nothing else to this game.

												Dear Esther is a short game but none the less one of my favirote games of all time. I compleated it in around 50 minutes however I stopped only a few times. The story is great. Or at least what I made it out to be. And well, that is where this game shines. It has a story so open, you, the player makes it up. It has an atmosphere that is great and exploration is rewarding with great visuals and scenes that other games do not achive. The colour pallet of the game is very bland, not to say this is bad. The colours chosen make the game much more like the creator wanted. The colours also help to guide the player. The smooth camera makes the game feel cinimatic and almost like a film, Just at 60fps (Hail GabeN :P). However, there is no combat which is obviously not wanted, but if you are after a action game, this is not for you. There is not one grudge I have with this game and it stands in my top 10 games of all time. 10 / 10. Amazing!			",180,27,5,18,21,0,17

												Recommended.  You should pick this up at some point and play it.Dear Esther is several, wonderful things.  I found it most enchanting as a (fairly limited) exploration simulator, harkening back to my times as an young man navigating and exploring the nearby woodlands.  Further still, it reminded me of many games I had played before (many games of the Zelda series and also Skyrim, for some examples) as the world told a story.  Each item and bit of dialogue was carefully placed to tell a story without words, and this felt like a world that had been lived in.  Conversely, the worlds of Skyrim and Zelda are plagued by gameplay and thus interfere with the exploration and sightseeing.  That's not a bad thing, because those games are not necessarily about exploration.As for the story, I was fairly drawn in.  I think the author(s?) do a great job of being vague and mysterious, giving little bits of information here and there, allowing you to form your own story as you progress.  It was quite entertaining.As a game, though, I have to say Dear Esther really isn't one.  It's an interactive experience, for sure, and it allegedly is slightly different each time (rng) but other than that it's not much of a game.  Regardless, play it.Play it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful game. Absolutely beautiful prose, narration, music, art. If you like literature or are even vaguely artsy, I want you to play this because not enough people understand how beautiful it is. Complex, rich parallel storyline that can be interpreted both figuratively and literally. ~English major intensifies~ Not really an English major... but seriously. It's a work of art, and of the highest quality too. If this was a book, it'd be my favorite book. But it's not, because it's meant to be that way, and it's beautiful that way. The narration, the vagueness, the art -- the interaction of music, visual art and story is what makes Dear Esther great. Really, it's all the beautiful complexity of literature... made interactive. I'd wish for more like it, but I don't see how prose that beautiful can be recreated or surpassed. Sorry. I felt the need to rewrite this review after Steam evidently erased it. This is one of my all-time favorite gifts.			",13,8,0,1,1,0,3

												Dear Esther was a title I followed quite closely the minute I had set eyes upon it (this review is quite horridly delayed in it's making and I apologize). It's incredible visuals had me drawn to seeing what it brought to the table, and sadly, it falls into a style of game that will constantly be picked on and labelled, pretentious, trying too hard or as a simple walking simulator. All of this could not be further from the truth. This is the kind of atmospheric game that has to be experienced and sampled. It is not for everyone, and that is completely fine. If lack of game-play makes something bad for you, steer clear of this. The storyline been a bit hazy, is actually done in such a way that makes it powerful and one of it's best qualities. The story conveys itself in a series of audio messages of a person who ended up on this uninhabited Hebridean island, listening to a series of voiced-over letter fragments to a woman named Esther. The narrator's identity is not specified, (Personally his voice reminded me of Richard Burton) though there are many suggestions that he is Esther's husband and that she died in a tragic car accident. He constantly references Esther, Paul, Donnelly and Jakobson and as you continue on it becomes more blurred as the game progresses, the narration moves between topics and relates the characters in different ways. The random selection of voice-over parts causes ambiguity opens up a lot of doors for the player to draw their own conclusions of the how this story ends up playing out. My take on the story is that this un-named protagonist lost all of his companions after somehow ending up on this island, some to infections they simply could not heal, some committed suicide, and some failed at escaping. It's unknown as to who or how many people were there previously, as the structures around the place lead me to conclude that this has happened before or that the people that were constantly refered back to made all of them. The last living piece of the puzzle is Esters husband.. Perhaps he had slowly gone mad and gone to the top of the aerial to kill himself and join his fallen friends. Moving on from that however.. The scenery and the music create such an incredible peaceful feeling. The environment draws you to it with it's beauty, making you stop just to admire it, or at least it did with me. I love the entire feel of this game as a whole, it's something new that we have not seen, forming art into a playable immersive form to lose yourself within your alone time, encompassing you in something you want to go from beginning to end. With it being semi-randomly generated, it does offer replay value of 2+ hours, making passes to places you may have missed before and in doing so end up finding more hidden dialogue as well. The opposing bit to that is that this only offers a max 3 hours of play, is sadly very short, but that by no means makes it bad. It is more of a story than an actual game as it offers nothing interact-able, other than just walking, listening and enjoying the land in which you travel across to get to the end.I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoys simply.. enjoying art, story and a stunning environment in which to do that in.

												Dear Esther is designed as more of a storytelling experience than a gameplay experience. You walk around, looking at the environment around you and listening to narration. This isn't an inherently bad design, but Dear Esther just moves too slowly. You move slowly and there is a lot of time between narrations where you can only walk forward and look at the only-partially-relevant environment. You end up spending most of your time not doing much of note and just waiting for the next segment to come up. The story, while decent, doesn't manage to pull the whole thing together. The way the story is told makes it hard to get very invested, and the story feels very disjointed because the narration and relevant environments are spread so far apart. Worst of all, the gameplay elements (walking and looking around) don't enhance the story at all because there's nothing to draw you in personally and the only thing the gameplay seems to allow is looking at things from different angles. Overall I found Dear Esther to be extremely dissapointing. It tried to be a story-driven experience that used gameplay elements to enhance the story, but it completely fails at doing so. You're better off doing something else with your time.			",91,28,0,24,17,0,19

It is as if they took the Oxford dictionary and threw it into a blender.Really, I could find no better example of ""saying something and yet nothing at all.""

												Went into this expecting some kind of Myst ripoff and I got an ""interactive"" movie instead. The narrator speaks cryptically about everything making what little story there is here very convoluted (randomization doesn't help the situation either). Dear Esther functions on intricate set pieces and music to keep your attention away from all the other problems with the game, like the fact it isn't a game. I'd be OK ""playing"" this if I got it in some Humble Indie Bundle but $10 for a remake of a 1 hour mod using the Source engine is ridiculous.The only reason I'm not slamming this for being the pretentious hipster garbage that it is is because of the subject matter at hand. Otherwise this game would be totally overlooked and reveiled for being what it is: another overpriced, misleading, pretentious ""indie"" game.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Dear Esther is a beutiful masterpiece made on the Source engine and is probably the most realistic game I have seen that was made on that engine. Seriously, I can't believe how much they pushed that engine to do what it the developers were able to do. This game tells a very well written story and the sound is all around you! They did an amazing job with the music of this game and the voice acting was very well done. I always love playing these story driven games and exploring the world that I am put in. A great way to relax yourself as a PC gamer. Beutiful game! I highly recomend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Walking simulator is not a game in common sence, attitude is different, you should defenetly play it if you want to walk or meditate in some way, not if you want to intertain yourself.+ Graphics are great. Colors are amaising. World is beautiful and interesting to explore.+ Sounds in game are great too. Wind and water and caves are very immersive.- A drunken electrician was hired to draw meaningless alcohol molecules and electric transformer schemes through the island. There are graphically beautiful sometimes.. but that is so lame.- Level designer need to be emprisoned in a bounding box forever. Immersion is breaked by invisible walls everywhere, you cant explore the world freely, you can only use paths that someone designed for you. - There is no way to shut up faceless storyteller your are forced to hear. He tells you a lot of pseudo-literary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and a lot of redundant information you do not need to hear at all. It will be much better if this content was optional in form of letters you can read by your own will.- Music is not so great.Soo.. you should defenetly buy and play this game to delight yourself with beautiful world and cold tundra island immersion trying not to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by bad game and narrative design decisions at the same time.

												Dear Esther is not for everybody. If it was a movie, it would Oscar bait. It's beautifully shot/framed and has great sound editing and mixing. It is not a summer blockbuster AAA type title. Dear Esther is best consumed while in some state of inebriation to add to the experience. The story is haunting and unique, giving it excellent replayability. Yes, it is a 'walking simulator,' and you should know this going into it. However, that is not a negative if you know what you are getting yourself into. If an artistic, atmospheric, story driven walking simulator with a top tier soundtrack doesn't sound appealing to you, don't buy it. If it does, you will not be disappointed.			",239,43,1,28,33,1,46

												Recommended.  You should pick this up at some point and play it.Dear Esther is several, wonderful things.  I found it most enchanting as a (fairly limited) exploration simulator, harkening back to my times as an young man navigating and exploring the nearby woodlands.  Further still, it reminded me of many games I had played before (many games of the Zelda series and also Skyrim, for some examples) as the world told a story.  Each item and bit of dialogue was carefully placed to tell a story without words, and this felt like a world that had been lived in.  Conversely, the worlds of Skyrim and Zelda are plagued by gameplay and thus interfere with the exploration and sightseeing.  That's not a bad thing, because those games are not necessarily about exploration.As for the story, I was fairly drawn in.  I think the author(s?) do a great job of being vague and mysterious, giving little bits of information here and there, allowing you to form your own story as you progress.  It was quite entertaining.As a game, though, I have to say Dear Esther really isn't one.  It's an interactive experience, for sure, and it allegedly is slightly different each time (rng) but other than that it's not much of a game.  Regardless, play it.Play it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther is a short game but none the less one of my favirote games of all time. I compleated it in around 50 minutes however I stopped only a few times. The story is great. Or at least what I made it out to be. And well, that is where this game shines. It has a story so open, you, the player makes it up. It has an atmosphere that is great and exploration is rewarding with great visuals and scenes that other games do not achive. The colour pallet of the game is very bland, not to say this is bad. The colours chosen make the game much more like the creator wanted. The colours also help to guide the player. The smooth camera makes the game feel cinimatic and almost like a film, Just at 60fps (Hail GabeN :P). However, there is no combat which is obviously not wanted, but if you are after a action game, this is not for you. There is not one grudge I have with this game and it stands in my top 10 games of all time. 10 / 10. Amazing!			",180,27,5,18,21,0,17

												This is not a game, but rather an attempt to create an effect akin to walking through poetry. The story is well written and holds depth beyond the surface explaination, the narration is exemplary, and the visuals are nothing short of phenominal.If you are looking for an experience to inspire, or move you, this does it well, for those who can appreciate it in all its complexity.But if you just want another game to play for mechanical interaction, this is not something you'll enjoy.

												This is not a game. Not even close. It is pretty much what most generic brown game companies aspire to be, in that there is no gameplay, and the player has no choice in anything. He is put on rails, and walks around a boring, deserted island at a speed a paralysed man would be shocked by its lack of speed. The slow speed combined with at least 2 paths to most places means that more often than not, you end up going back the same way you came, and only notice after 5 minutes of drudgery, as the landscape is essentially the same throughout, apart from a few obvious bits. This 'game' is essentially made by someone who likes making models, and a guy who likes writing stories.Gameplay: -10/10Story: 5/10Ambiance: 2/10Can't really do any other scores, as there is nothing else to this game.

												Beautiful game. Absolutely beautiful prose, narration, music, art. If you like literature or are even vaguely artsy, I want you to play this because not enough people understand how beautiful it is. Complex, rich parallel storyline that can be interpreted both figuratively and literally. ~English major intensifies~ Not really an English major... but seriously. It's a work of art, and of the highest quality too. If this was a book, it'd be my favorite book. But it's not, because it's meant to be that way, and it's beautiful that way. The narration, the vagueness, the art -- the interaction of music, visual art and story is what makes Dear Esther great. Really, it's all the beautiful complexity of literature... made interactive. I'd wish for more like it, but I don't see how prose that beautiful can be recreated or surpassed. Sorry. I felt the need to rewrite this review after Steam evidently erased it. This is one of my all-time favorite gifts.			",13,8,0,1,1,0,3

												Dear Esther was a title I followed quite closely the minute I had set eyes upon it (this review is quite horridly delayed in it's making and I apologize). It's incredible visuals had me drawn to seeing what it brought to the table, and sadly, it falls into a style of game that will constantly be picked on and labelled, pretentious, trying too hard or as a simple walking simulator. All of this could not be further from the truth. This is the kind of atmospheric game that has to be experienced and sampled. It is not for everyone, and that is completely fine. If lack of game-play makes something bad for you, steer clear of this. The storyline been a bit hazy, is actually done in such a way that makes it powerful and one of it's best qualities. The story conveys itself in a series of audio messages of a person who ended up on this uninhabited Hebridean island, listening to a series of voiced-over letter fragments to a woman named Esther. The narrator's identity is not specified, (Personally his voice reminded me of Richard Burton) though there are many suggestions that he is Esther's husband and that she died in a tragic car accident. He constantly references Esther, Paul, Donnelly and Jakobson and as you continue on it becomes more blurred as the game progresses, the narration moves between topics and relates the characters in different ways. The random selection of voice-over parts causes ambiguity opens up a lot of doors for the player to draw their own conclusions of the how this story ends up playing out. My take on the story is that this un-named protagonist lost all of his companions after somehow ending up on this island, some to infections they simply could not heal, some committed suicide, and some failed at escaping. It's unknown as to who or how many people were there previously, as the structures around the place lead me to conclude that this has happened before or that the people that were constantly refered back to made all of them. The last living piece of the puzzle is Esters husband.. Perhaps he had slowly gone mad and gone to the top of the aerial to kill himself and join his fallen friends. Moving on from that however.. The scenery and the music create such an incredible peaceful feeling. The environment draws you to it with it's beauty, making you stop just to admire it, or at least it did with me. I love the entire feel of this game as a whole, it's something new that we have not seen, forming art into a playable immersive form to lose yourself within your alone time, encompassing you in something you want to go from beginning to end. With it being semi-randomly generated, it does offer replay value of 2+ hours, making passes to places you may have missed before and in doing so end up finding more hidden dialogue as well. The opposing bit to that is that this only offers a max 3 hours of play, is sadly very short, but that by no means makes it bad. It is more of a story than an actual game as it offers nothing interact-able, other than just walking, listening and enjoying the land in which you travel across to get to the end.I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoys simply.. enjoying art, story and a stunning environment in which to do that in.

												Dear Esther isn't much of a game, there's no challenge or goals involved. All you do is press forward. Literally. That being said, it's only the surface of things. Dear Esther manages to pull off one thing a good game is supposed to have: the atmosphere and it does that so well. The abandoned island reeks with melancholy and it certainly makes you ponder. There were times I could almost feel the wind hitting my face, it's quite an amazing experience in that regard. The tranquility of the island is further amplified by a beautiful sound track by Jessica Curry, I've slept listening to it numerous times. While the occasional dialogue makes little to no sense as a whole, that doesn't by the least bit turn me off from the experience, rather it makes the experience all the more intense, thanks to the terrific voice over work. Considering it is lacking a lot of fundamental characterisitcs of a videogame, it still remains to be one of the best experiences I've had. To put it in perspective, I have replayed that 4 times so far just so I could get some alone time, where as I can mention a bunch of actual games in my library which I've left without even playing them for an hour, let alone completing them. Moreover, I certainly see myself getting back to it yet again, Oculus Rift support would make that all the more tempting. I've certainly become a fan of Chinese Room after this so I'm looking forward to checking out Everybody's Gone to Rapture.			",173,60,2,19,14,2,15

												Dear Esther seamlessly wrapped me up in a story as it played less like a game and more like an interactive movie. The narration was just vague enough for me to get a sense of what had happened to him while leaving my imagination to wander slightly. And of course, as many other reviews noted, the game is beautiful. I'm looking forward to trying it on the Oculus.			",42,27,0,10,4,0,3

												Right off the bat, this game is not a game, it's an experience. Or a walking simulator. The idea is you wake up on an island that may or may not actually exist as you travel to a beacon in the centre of the island because it's flashing red so why not. If you're looking for a fun game to play turn the hell back because this game doesn't have any, you walk around listening to the monologue of the player character. The only motivation you have though is curiosity to try and figure out what happened, you won’t be saving the world from the combine or any♥♥♥♥♥♥like that here. I have to give it credit though, I was definitely interested enough to see it through to the end, which took me under one hour to reach so this is more of an interactive art thing than anything else.Nothing in this game is set in stone though, you are left to interpret the events and things you see for yourself, so this game and its plot and meaning are entirely what you make of it. Also, many of the things you see in this game are different each time you play. Some stuff you see or hear may not be in other playthroughs so due to the purposefully fragmented and incoherency it forces you to guess for yourself what're really happening even more.""It can take up to 6-8 full runs in order to have seen every object and/or event at least once.""The graphics and environments are very pretty though and the soundtrack is nice and fitting, lots of stuff for you to see and wonder what the significant of this thing you're looking at is alright I found most of the writing on the cliff walls hard to read and often found myself not listening to half of what the character said because I was inspecting things I found and the 'ghosts'.It's not a scary game in the slightest, it might be a bit eerie if you're a wuss, especially if you wander into a building, but the ‘ghosts’ people talk about are just vague figures you can see from far away that are obviously humanoid but are gone by the time you get there. They're not spooky or unsettling it's more of a ""I want to go to where they were and see what the deal is"" feeling of interest and fascination. It's interesting, for sure. I'd say it's worth checking out, but would I buy it at regular price? Nah, probably not, especially since it's under an hour in length. Still though, pretty nifty little thing. ",164,26,0,32,14,0,13

It's not a game, it's not fun, it has zero mechanics and is the true epitome of a walking simulator. So why do I recommend Dear Esther?Because it is able to invoke emotion through both the little tidbits of story the player encounters and by extremely beautiful and atmospheric scenery.When I showed this my dad, he told me he didn't get it, but he still spent almost twenty minutes looking at the sea.

But the story lacks for something. Rather than feeling any emotional connection to the narrator or his plight, I felt like I was swimming through a pool of verbal nonsense. It is as if they took the Oxford dictionary and threw it into a blender.Really, I could find no better example of ""saying something and yet nothing at all.""

												I've got mixed feelings about this one, but overall I do recommend it simply because the environments you explore are so beautifully crafted. I particularly thought the water in the game looked really good. This game is very atmospheric and I can see now that some of the other walking simulators I have played were trying to tap into what this game accomplished. Heck, I think now that Montague's Mount is sort of a rip off of Dear Esther except it was near monochromatic, was poorly optimized, and had annoying puzzles.Again, I am glad I played this game but I can't say that I loved it. Perhaps if I had played this before some of the other walking sims I have experienced, then I would have been totally enthralled by it. Maybe I just got burned out of all of the games I have played that might have been at least partially inspired by Dear Esther. One can only take so much walking around slowly, listening to creepy music/sounds, and trying to understand dreary, non-linear, ambiguous narrative.			",45,43,1,3,6,0,6

												When I first started playing Dear Esther I was skeptical. I wasn't exactly sure what I needed to do or where I needed to go, but the longer you emmerse yourself into the world, the easier it becomes. As a writer, I absolutely ADORE the narrative parts of this, the metaphors and imagery are so incredibly strong, which add more beauty to the experience that Dear Esther gives. Overall, this gives the player an incredibly beautiful and poetic experience, definitely one of my all time favorites.			",12,5,0,6,0,0,0

												I really liked Dear Esther alot. Though I did feel like my character moved to slow at first and it felt really linear, I came to appriciate this at the ending. If your looking for a game this really isnt one. You have to play this from start to finish. its very short. the ending is what makes it so great. This is really a new form of interactive art. Totally worth the price for the expereince. I would recommend everyone play this but make sure you set aside a couple dedicated hours and beat it without a break otherewise it ruins the experience.To sum it up...... if your looking for an interesting experimental art form GET THIS. but if you want a game no.

Even it might be very short it will let you just sink into it and you won`t be the same after you will have finished it.This Game will always have a special place in my heart and I will for sure never ever forget the Soundtrack from Jessica Curry that is still three years after I have heard it the first time breathtaking.

												Do not be fooled: Dear Esther is not a game, but rather an extended quick-time event involving the W-key and a mouse. Any story or message is ruined thanks to an overly vague monologue and a linear grind through a flowery landscape and cavern complex. I've read that some users managed to glean some meaning from this pretentious pile of philosophical rubbish and consumer regret thanks to scouring the landscape for reflected silhouettes and such. I was unsuccessful in that task; all I managed to feel at the end of Dear Esther was the loss of time and money.The Good:- decent graphics- solid voice actingThe Bad:- severely limited exploration- obfuscated narrative that desperately runs away from the userThe Ugly:- the simple lack of activity; no diaries to read, no notes to decipher, no mysteries to unravel (other than ""Why did I buy this"")			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther is in many ways a visual novel, but the atmosphere and the unique gameplay make it stand out heavily from all other games. Dear Esther is one of the few games out there that have created a unique experience that can not be categorized. For anyone that just want to try something new and get lost in mysterious island, this is the game for you.However no matter how amazing Dear Esther might be it got almost zero replay value, the game can only be played once before it gets boring which makes it a sort of a seen once, play once. But this doesn't mean its bad, its just a short and sweet experience. When the game is under 10 bucks its actually worth it. 6,5/10			",257,29,2,32,16,1,34

												This ""game"" is really interactive art. And by interactive I mean you can wander around, there's not anything in the world you can really interact with. As you wander you occasionally get some vague dialogue tells a little bit more about the story. This dialogue is apparently somewhat randomized, but the main story doesn't change, just some of the unimportant details.The graphics are good, especially in the caves. The levels are mostly linear with few side paths and fewer alternate routes, limiting the sense of exploration. The story is intentionally vague and open to interpretation with an ending that shows that the whole island isn't actually real. It goes right along with the interactive art aspect so it's not a negative for me.The big issue with this game that prevents me from recommending it is the price relative to how short the game is. Look at my playtime, that's how long it took to play through with backtracking to see all the side paths. At least I got this as part of a bundle because it's not worth $10, at most it might be worth $2.50 on a 75% off sale, and even then only if you're into this kind of game.			",549,183,19,71,76,4,115

												tl;dr:    Interesting and provoking thoughts, but NOT a game, NOT worth money.Dear Esther is an artistic work, I cannot deny that, but the creator lost all right for respect and credit when putting this up for sale. There are many modders out there who contribute much greater, albeit different, efforts for free. Whether intentional or not, putting it up here on steam was awfully misleading and tricked many into buying it, believing it is an actual adventure game. At least everyone I know who bought the game, including myself, sprung that trap.It is an insult to all modders out there that this ""game"" is being sold. The developers of Dear Esther were thrown a lot of money that others deserve more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you buy this, you will want your money back.  It is a video of a location, that's all.  Imaging a video of a deserted island at night, paired with  portions of an audio book, then chop up the audio book into small non-logical sequences.  There is a mystery story with creepy music, a disjointed and non-sensical story.  However you cannot hear the entire story until you have roamed around this island with monotonous backdrops.  The most exciting thing were the mushrooms in the cave which always pointed at you.  DO NOT buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's a beautiful landscape you can walk around in and listen to dialogue. That's great and all, but part of the definition of 'games' to me is interaction.

												Dear Esther﻿.  I'm feeling sorry for myself so listen to my drivel.  Too soon?  I had heard all these amazing things about the game and had been waiting for a chance to play it.   Finally had some time this evening...Anyway, stop reading now (SPOILER ALERT) if you ever plan to play this game.  Ugh, I know ... I know.... I'm supposed to be moved... and maybe it makes me a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... but quit the pity party.  If your life really does suck so much, go devote your time and energy to making the world a better place ... volunteer at a soup kitchen or something.So disappointing to find a game that initially heartens with beautiful rendering of the British coastline (a place so much like so many places I've hiked) only to find that 45 minutes later I am so utterly disappointed with a glorification of suicide.  Was that supposed to be a surprise ending?The only surprise was that it actually ended so predictably. Sure, it's ""original"" for a game... but not for poorly written angst that you couldn't get published in book form... about on par with the works I had to read by classmates in the creative writing class I took in college. If only they had enabled SHIFT-W and allowed me to run, then I'd have only wasted as 20 minutes of my evening instead of 45.If it is any consolation, it seems the rest of the team was extremely talented, but if this is what passes for ""games as art"", we're doomed.

A first-person exploration of a deserted island, snippets of text by a narrator who may or may not be your character, and a goal that defies the established rules of accepted gameplay. You do not play Dear Esther - you experience it. A supremely beautiful work of interactive fiction, at once heart-breaking and heart-warming, Dear Esther is a sublime masterpiece that dares you to come out of the voyage unchanged.

												Dear Esther is a great detour away from the typical fast paced AAA genres that most of us spend a good chunk of our time in. Explore the game with patience and an open mind and preferably in a dark room with no other distractions. The game is short (around 60-90 minutes depending on your route) and worth playing through in one sitting.  Like any good book or movie you'll spend more time thinking about the game after it's finished than you did playing it.			",459,123,10,66,47,6,70

												Its hard to recommend this as it is just a adventure game,it has good graphics it would of made a great game for a frist person type zombie game or something to that point i got it really cheap i went through all of it and it seemed short to me,if you get it for free or $2 bucks i say go for it to just get a different type of genere to play around with and take a break from all the games that require  a lot to do. It played well i had no issues,it could have had less boundries in the whole adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All in all, it's very relaxed but with little gameplay other than walking around. If you're in the mood for more of a relaxing ""experince"" as opposed to a traditional game, then I highly recommend this.			",283,132,7,28,71,6,15

												Other than a vivid landscape, I really didn't enjoy it. the walkng felt slow and tedious, and other than some hard to read cryptic verses and a few spots, exploring the scenery doesn't lead you to any interesting clues r details. The main source of story is the monolauge of the narrator. If you want to play an atmosphiric walking simulator, I would suggest Ether One. It feels very similar i most regards, but improved in almost every regard. it also includes some puzzles that help you understand the story better and makes you feel more involved than in ""Dear, Easter"".

												In this game (where some may not even call it a real game), there's no actual gameplay other than you controlling where the MC walks around the island. While walking, you reach certain checkpoints where the narrator continues the story. It's a very short game (takes about one to two hours to complete, though you can spend a lot more just looking around) as there are only three chapters to the story. In each chapter, a large tower with a red, blinking light at the top is always visable and is seen as sort of a goal to reach in the game. The graphics on the otherhand are amazing. You get to explore crystal cavens and beaches with lanterns as well as many other cool places. I found the game to be very calming and relaxing and while it is very slow paced, it was very enjoyable and time well spent. Another thing: I would wait for Steam to put it on sale. Normally, it's around ten bucks, but I got it half off. While it's an all around beautiful and stunning game, you only receive around five hours (depending how much you actually explore since I clocked in about seven hours) of gameplay, I feel it's not really worth the ten bucks. If you can get it for less though, I would say go for it!			",36,18,0,8,5,0,1

												If you go to my profile and check out the list of games I own, then you should know that I love games with stories. If the game itself has more of an interesting plot, than gameplay, there is a good chance I'll take a shot at it. I've played games like Myst and Ether One so I know how these games work. Limited interacting with the environment, ""show"" more than tell and vague story telling before getting the point of the story.I'm all for that.But Dear Esther, unfortunately, has none of those qualities.And I tried, really I did. You can see above that I've played this game for up to an hour. But unfortunately I just couldn't get into this game at all. The game's plot is that of a man roaming an island moving from one place to the next while a narration plays explaining details of your situation. And that's it.Now that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if both what you're watching on screen and what the narrator is saying, corresponded to each other. But the thing is: they don't.At least nothing was there that I could see right off the bat. I'm ALL for deep storytelling, but the writing in Dear Esther is so heavy and so meticulous that it comes across as pompous. You just don't get a feel at all for what's happening to your character or whoever Esther is. I really wanted there to be a ""hook"" to this game, but there just isn't one. Nothing that grabbed my attention.Another problem comes in with the fact what gameplay you have is very - not limited necessarily - but ""unimportant"". With most visual games like these, what you ""see"" is what tells the story. But Dear Esther's island is just ... bland. Nothing here that's unique or at least nothing that you see here gives you any clues at all to what's happening. The house you enter, the cave, the beach, the lighthouse or the plains... all of it has nothing that adds to what is going on and has been done many many times before.Not only that, but the dialogue CHANGES with each play through. So you won't be listening to the same thing every time. I assume that each variation of the script leads to the same place at the end. but after roaming around for a good ten minutes, painfully slow, not finding anything and then deciding to quit for the day, only to replay with a new read of what was happening... was just discouraging.I love these types of games. And I REALLY wanted to like Dear Esther, but I can't recommend it to anyone. The dialogue and game feel so distant from each other, and to reach the ending of either conclusion just never felt like time or energy worth spent.			",30,18,1,4,3,1,6

												I only played it for 7 minutes, but not because it was bad.I was physically and mentally unable to continue any longer than that.This is by far one of the scariest horror games I have ever played. The oppressive, eerie atmosphere completely wreaked havoc upon my senses and I was too terrified to go anywhere. I took a few steps in various directions, but I ended up cowering in fear and returning to the start each time. I just mentally couldn't handle going out into the strange desolate landscape that surrounded me. It was a very fascinating and horrifying sensation.Never in my life have experienced that kind of fear before.10/10Probably the best horror game ever made. THIS is how you do horror. You don't rely on cheap jumpscares. You create tension with the environment and suspense, and create an atmosphere in which the player feels absolute terror that they refuse to even move.

												In short: If I could vote neutral, it would be my choice.. it's not good nor bad.What so say about this game...Pros:- some sound effects are very enjoyable- some graphics are pretty good looking like the moon and the sky- the atmosphere is goodCons:- graphics are not high end but the atmosphere created is good enough to make you forget about this- the character is slower than a turtle- not much things to admire but plants, fences, water.... which make the game boring (report to previous point)- game lengh is very low so buy on sale only cuz it doesnt worth 10$ in my opinionAbout the story, I cannot say it's a pro or a con. If you are not speaking english well, you're gonna think they took very good drugs when they made the game. I guess there is alot metaphorical stuff that a non native speaker could have hard time to handle  (like me, I'm french). So I wont say the story is bad but very hard to follow properly if your english is not good enough. I guess people that can understand every part of it could enjoy a little more.I'll recommend the game but only if you speak english kind of very well and if the game is on sale. And if you are not a hardcore fan of exploration/walking simulator, skip it, you'll find it boring from the beginning. Overall, it's ok game if you understand everything but a little short. I think they could have make something even better cuz the graphics (outside of the psychedelic cave) and the atmosphere were enjoyable... but the story is.. WTF... the lengh is low and interactions in the game are really poor. Ok game for 2$... if you're a huge fan of story  based/exploration game only... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*TL;DR: Gorgeous, eerie, and mesmerizing experience, but not for everyone. Pretty short. Only controls are arrow keys - literally a walking simulator. No manual interaction. However, if you like this sort of thing, it's awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would say don't play this when you're in the mood to ""game."" It's more of a passive, story-based experience.*This is a beautiful, story-heavy walking simulator. Some people would argue against it being considered a game. You pick up bits and pieces of a mysterious, unsettling story as you explore a lonely British isle. The scenery is breathtaking, especially in the cave segments. The story is strange and immersive, seeming more convoluted and dark the more you find out. The order of story segments that you hear depends on the paths you take. The game can be replayed, taking different paths until you unravel the story. Encountering certain locations trigger bits of the plot to be revealed. The narration is solid and the soundtrack is haunting.			",29,11,0,3,5,0,0

												A very beautiful game, but a very boring one in my opinion.  I kind of knew what I was getting myself into from what I've heard about the game.  I was hoping to be surprised, but alas, I was not.The game is narrative heavy and is very vague and cryptic.  This does make you want to hear and play more in the hopes that the game will soon clarify the wordy narrative.  Unfortunately, if you're anything like me, you'll be asking yourself, ""What just happened?"" by the time the screen goes black.You may have noticed that I gave this game a thumbs up.  Even though I did not enjoy the game, I still really appreciated the hard work that most likely went into making this game look as beautiful as it does.  The cavern segments in particular were very pleasant to play through.  And even though I didn't enjoy it, doesn't mean that somebody else won't.  The short length, in my opinion, justifies at least one play through even if this isn't your cup of tea.			",317,82,2,33,41,0,56

												The game starts with some guy (the guy I'm controlling, maybe?) rambling on about a shipwreck. I look around a bit, and I see a house just up the path. As I enter it, the game automatically turns on the flashlight despite having literally no other controls for me to do other than walk and look. Seems like they could have let me do that. Anywho, the house was devoid of anything meaningful. Okay, well, that's just the first place, and I literally just got here. I shouldn't expect them to reel me into something interesting so quickly. You know, like a well-written story.So I continue up the path to a cave, and I start babbling about a legend of some guy in the cave. Awesome, but I wonder why my flashlight did not come on this time. Maybe it's supposed to be dark because something sweet is going to happen. I reach the dead end of cave expecting...something, but alas, the cave, too, is empty. The narrator/internal monologue/crazy guy talking to himself finishes the story with something along the lines of ""like everyone else, I suppose he deemed me unworthy."" Ha, I get jokes. Well played, game. You totally got me.I turn back to my beachhead, at a casual stroll, of course. There is no run button either. Just walk, look, and what I like to call ""squint,"" because it's kind of like a zoom, only not really. But I leisurely walk down the beach, wondering why there are no footprints in the sand. I guess not only is Jesus not with me today, but also I can levitate. Am I a Jedi? They can fly right? Oh wait, I'm thinking of David Blaine. That guy is legit.I spot was appears to be a drawing in the sand. I study it for a minute, but like most artists, the elusive Sand Blaster is not going to be appreciated in his lifetime. I suspect it is actually a map of sorts, seeing as there is what appears to be an arrow swooping down towards...something...from the main part. I become wistful for a minimap or compass, or the ability to do anything, but I resign myself to pushing onward.Further up the beach, the voices in my head mention finding the ship's manifest amongst some paint cans. I remember seeing those in the house. Did I say the house was empty? Well, I lied. It did have empty paint cans in with all the other debris. I feel terrible for keeping such a vital detail from you. Forgive me? Sweet. You're the best. I <3 you. But the manifest! Surely that will have some pertinent information. I don't have an inventory, nor did I actually pick anything up, but the voices in my head would not leave me hanging...I reach the end of the beach. There is a rocky creek of sorts leading off the beach, but I can clearly see that goes nowhere. I look around in every direction. Another dead end, it would seem. Plus, the voices in my head have gone silent. They didn't even enlighten me as to what was on that rad manifest. Bummer. I guess I should walk back to the start again...Suddenly, I find myself overwhelmed with a desire to walk into the ocean and end this waking nightmare. To silence the demon of boredom in my head. I step into the water and feel a sense of relief. I keep going at my usual sprinter-on-tranquilizers pace. Steadily the water rises to eye level, only to stop. Ah, such are the invisible walls of existence that keep us eye-level with the sky and the texture-less blackness below, with the soothing sounds of dunking your head over and over again. Much like the juxtaposition of my zoom/squint button, I find myself drowning but not drowning.I stare off into the ocean abyss and contemplate the decisions I've made with my life.10/10, would play for 9 minutes and uninstall again.

												In recent years, there has been a notable rift in video game styles. Some excel, some flop, and some are financially successful despite their quality. This rift nearly always has to do with ""story,"" which is integral to game success. Story is necessary to establish timeless association, connection with a game. This is why games with good story release well-received and remain well-received.Now, story must be visually presented in a video game. Retro games prove that absolute best resolution isn't necessary for good story. At the same time, however, poor visual presentation will cloud and possibly ruin the story. They must be in tandem. Now to my point. Dear Esther provides both visuals and story in extremely fine beauty, and sets you free to explore it. Set against moody oceanic weather, open to explore the island, and surrounded by Jessica Curry's haunting, exquisite soundtrack, this is an experience you'll never forget. Storytelling comes in a whole new fashion here, and I absolutely loved it.If you don't enjoy first-person exploration games, or narrative-driven games, this might not be your cup of tea, but I would suggest watching the trailer, and if you like what you see, please play. If not, the soundtrack is available separately, and is definitely worth listening to in full.My only criticism of this game would be that it seems too short. I was finished in about 2 hours, and for some it would take just over an hour. There is new narrative to find by replaying, and I will definitely do it again soon, but I wanted to stay immersed in that world much longer.There is no adult content of any sort, that I have run across or heard mention of, or violence. The only reason I'd suggest it for 16+ years is that anyone younger would have a difficult time understanding the story. I highly recommend this game.			",73,16,1,7,12,0,5

												The game is ok, it has a intresting story line however it's not a game you would play more than once or twice because after you have completed the campaign there is nothing else to do and the story line is always the same so it would get quite boring.			",124,9,2,10,5,0,5

												Dear Esther...this game is actually a lot better than i expected it to be. the graphics and landscape are just plain BEAUTIFUL! the controls are pretty good. your character moves slightly slow, but its very easy to get used to. the story is a nice, and often chilling, story about a guy who gets deserted on an island, and instead of talking to himself, he speaks in passages from letters he writes to his love, Esther. its overall, an amazing experience, and i would definitely reccomend this game to anyone looking for a beautiful game and great story.

												In short: If I could vote neutral, it would be my choice.. it's not good nor bad.What so say about this game...Pros:- some sound effects are very enjoyable- some graphics are pretty good looking like the moon and the sky- the atmosphere is goodCons:- graphics are not high end but the atmosphere created is good enough to make you forget about this- the character is slower than a turtle- not much things to admire but plants, fences, water.... which make the game boring (report to previous point)- game lengh is very low so buy on sale only cuz it doesnt worth 10$ in my opinionAbout the story, I cannot say it's a pro or a con. If you are not speaking english well, you're gonna think they took very good drugs when they made the game. I guess there is alot metaphorical stuff that a non native speaker could have hard time to handle  (like me, I'm french). So I wont say the story is bad but very hard to follow properly if your english is not good enough. I guess people that can understand every part of it could enjoy a little more.I'll recommend the game but only if you speak english kind of very well and if the game is on sale. And if you are not a hardcore fan of exploration/walking simulator, skip it, you'll find it boring from the beginning. Overall, it's ok game if you understand everything but a little short. I think they could have make something even better cuz the graphics (outside of the psychedelic cave) and the atmosphere were enjoyable... but the story is.. WTF... the lengh is low and interactions in the game are really poor. Ok game for 2$... if you're a huge fan of story  based/exploration game only... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A calm journeyDear Esther is not your typical video game. It is a game that is a clear definition of 'art', not focusing on gameplay but rather other elements such as sound, graphics and story.Story is complicated, yet deep. You play as an individual who is stranded on a mysterious island. As you wonder the island you get to listen to the narrator, who gives some insights about the island and characters. The overall story is left quite vague and can be interpreted in different ways.Gameplay is left to be desired. You start off on a shore of an island with a house in front of you. There is no guide on which direction to explore the island as you basically move from one area to the next. There is limited interactions with objects around you in certain scenarios, however most of the gameplay reveolves around walking and exploring the island. To its defence, the limited gameplay makes the player take in the music and environment around them.Graphics are beautiful. Seriously, when you play this game your going to want to take lots of screenshots. The environment looks incredible (especially the caves) which clearly shows that plenty of care and detail went into creating it.Audio is fantastic. Using orchestrated pieces, the audio creates a calm and relaxing atmosphere, which helps you enjoy the sights. The narrator's voice acting is good as well.If you want to play a relaxing game that is not about winning as it is experiencing, Dear Esther is your game.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

However, ""exploration"" is a bad choice of word, since there's really nothing to discover. You could move forward with your eyes closed and you'd experience 99% of the game.Still, it's a pretty game and a unique experience to try out at some point - just not for money.

												You wander around an uninhabited island and never interacting with anything.The whole game is basically you in first person walking through the game and listening to sort of random narratives played as you progress through the island, giving you ambiguous, broken pieces to a story. The played narratives are parts of letters that some man had written to a woman named Esther.This is arguably even a game. Its like a book, with pictures, where you have to keep walking to read it and deal with sometimes annoying gaps of frustratingly slow walking between narrative activations.			",172,30,2,8,27,1,39

												It's a beautiful game, but I can't recommend it unless you're into just wandering around with some beautiful atmosphere. It's short, but can hardly be called a game.  Most people without a poetic side would find it just boring.  It leaves you with a very melancholic feeling.  The environments are stunning, the voice over is well done, and the prose is beautiful.  But seriously, many people will be bored to tears and you also can get the effect of playing it just by watching a play through online.			",44,17,0,6,2,0,4

												I hate myself for this, but I can't recommend Dear Esther.  It is undoubtedly gorgeous and atmospheric with achingly beautiful environments and haunting music, but essentially feels very pretentious.To start at the beginning, this is not a game, it is a piece of art.  I am happy with that as a concept and bought it as such.  Sadly, it is limited by both elements of its design.  It is too steeped in its artistry to make a functional game, but also has enough input from you to detract from the artistic experience.  The main problem is that there are some fairly open areas that allow a modicum of exploration - there's nothing to find, or even really see, but it's still exploration - sadly you move incredibly slowly and the path is necessarily linear.  If you happen to walk in the wrong direction, it feels like an absolute chore trying to get back to where you need to be.  I know it's not meant to be ""fun"", but it it can feel broing.Nonetheless, I wouldn't have minded but the first time I played it I was called away and exitted the game after getting to the second part of the game.  The start screen suggested that I would be able to start from there the next time I played.  No.  I assume you can only choose were to play from once you finish the game.  Well, I only wasted 25 minutes.  Not a problem.  The second time I played, I got into the cave system (an amazing looking part of the experience!).  When I tried to cross a little stream, I got stuck in the scenery.  That was that.  I had to start from the beginning again.  Truthfully, I couldn't sit through it and just Googled a synopsis and watched a video on YouTube.By no means is this experience bad in itself, but I couldn't recommend it to the average gamer.  In fact, I could only recommend it to a very specific type of person, and I don't even know who that would be.			",479,106,15,91,37,6,74

												Obtuse and morbid, Dear Ester is not a game for those looking to spend their evening doing anything other than crying into a pet's fur or a friend's shoulder. Initially, the protagonist's ramblings were obfuscating and enigmatic. As you explore the island, however, it is clear that his problems run far deeper than a death wish. If you have any empathy at all, this game will make you mourn. For better or worse, it is essentially a monologue with pretty scenery.Pros:Beautiful sceneryQuirky, poetic protagonistDevastating endingCons:Quirky, poetic protagonist who likes to hear himself talkYou must roll with the protagonist until he starts to make sense (if he makes sense at all)Not a game to play if you've felt depressed at all within living memory			",36,38,0,19,4,1,3

												I'm not entirely sure what I expected from this game, other than the rather negative reactions I've already seen from it. To start off, I'm not at all against games that are story-driven, though it's as if this game tries way too hard to prevent the player from learning what the story of Dear Esther is. Mystisism can only go so far, and while it worked in games like The Legend of Zelda or Myst, this one is simply dull and uninteresting.There's nothing really motivating you to go on other than the fact that ""the game is short and I should beat it because I have an hour and a half to spare"". Personally, I just set the walk-speed to Gordon Freeman's speed and lessened the game about a whole hour by doing so - but do you see the issue there? The only thing making this game about an hour and a half long is the walking speed, and it's not worth the trouble. I understand that some games try to be deep and meaningful in their stories, but this is just crap. The Fibonacci spiral has nothing to do with the story, and you're going to be lucky if anyone catches the whole gasoline and alcohol chemical diagrams by the end. If you're trying to be cryptic, then make it so that the average player can understand. This is not exactly something that the common player will know off-hand, and with that, the story of this game becomes null and void.Some games make up for a horrible story with their gameplay, such as Doom, Far Cry 3 and Duke Nukem 3D. All of which work better without a story, as those would drive the game down as a whole. This game, however, has hardly a story to begin with, yet forces the player to simply hold down W for a good hour and a half. There is no gameplay here - and I'm not asking for much. Myst was a heavily story-based game that included logic-based puzzles and a secluded, mysterious atmosphere. The puzzles and exploration are what made that game a game, and it felt satisfying to logically find the answers to said puzzles. This game, has no gameplay whatsoever: no puzzles, no combat, no characters. Nothing. There's nothing motivating the average player to beat this game other than ""it can be beaten in two hours"", and anyone with a job or an active social life might just be appealed by that aspect alone, though it's two hours that could've been better-spent somewhere else.Much like Gone Home, this game has a great, eerie atmosphere that is gone to waste by the overall boring gameplay. The story isn't very good, and it really doesn't have much of a reason to play it more than once. There's no way I could recommend this game less to anyone.			",258,69,2,25,24,2,12

												I highly reccomend NOT buying this game. I play on a mid-range computer, and by the second chapter it was too laggy to carry on. Despite this, there is nothing to do in this game. It may tell one of the best stories in the world, but I'll never hear all of it because it doesn't hook you. It just sends you around a boring island with some graffiti around it with the slowest walking I have found. It also punishes exploration. For every time I said ""Hey, can I go there?"" the answer never changed from being no. The tone is all over the place, too. I couldn't tell if the island was barren or had been sprawling with life at some point. If you want the story, I'd read it with all the fragments put together, on a Microsoft Word document or something.			",214,35,3,13,28,1,16

												First of all, a word of warning here... this is NOT A GAME, so to speak. It is more like an immersive experience to be had while wandering in this simulated game world.From what I can say, this ""game"" gives the player a deep note of sadness, loneliness, while walking around the island.I was curious, read a few reviews here and there... while they were positive, I didn't really enjoy the game much. It actually was close to make me fall asleep on my keyboard (a few times actually), probably due for playing this game late at night.Only controls in this ""game""... ""WASD"" + Mouse look. No interraction with anything. You basically just walk and listen to narrator speaking. At the least, the visuals are outsanding on this aging Source Engine (have a look on screenshots).I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who don't like to try and do something totally different in a game. Last note, if you're really curious about this title, buy on a sale! I know I should've done so!RATING:5.0 / 10			",800,167,27,82,79,2,130

It's an exploration type game, but every letter is written in Ye Olde English, which for some isn't a problem, but others won't understand what is going on. Also, they seem rather random, but that may be because of the order in which you find them. There is no interactive nature at all in this game.

I actually remember the story of both of those, but this guy, I'm like uhhhh there's a wreck and maybe someone was drinking and uhhhh... yeah... I don't know what's happening. Also: power-walking.

												I wish I would trust my pessimistic nature more: It would have saved me ten bucks. If you're looking for a video game that uses exploration and narration to tell a rich and deep story? You won't find it here.While beautifully rendered and wonderfully narrated, Dear Esther just doesn't tell a real story. It uses its environmental beauty to keep you interested on whats a rather short railroad with little actually offered to explore, and attempts to use both scientific symbols and religious references to the journey of Saul to Demascas to make whats a rather straightforward and simple story seem deeper than it really is.A lot of potential wasted here, sadly. Playing Dear Esther will just make you wish it'd lived up to be more than what it was, even given its humble indie background. They just didn't take advantage of what they could have.

It's all but completely pointless and it's not even really a game. It's art rendered through a game engine. This game does show that the Source engine still has some tricks up its aging sleeves.

You could move forward with your eyes closed and you'd experience 99% of the game.Still, it's a pretty game and a unique experience to try out at some point - just not for money.

The movement speed is painfully slow and there is basically nothing that moves other than a seagull and the environment; think flowing water and grass waving in the breeze. The narrative is at least a little bit interesting, but so cryptic and short that I didn't find it very compelling. After reading some community feedback and thoughts, there might be more to the game than I realized and certainly there are all kinds of interpretations to make, but there is absolutely zero chance that I'm going to trudge through the four chapters of this game again just to see some extra car parts strewn onto a cliff face and hear a few different lines of dialogue.I can't recommend this game, it was simply too boring to be worth the $10.

												If you like walking simulators that don't let you interact with the environment in any way at all, you'll like Dear Esther. If you want to feel underwhelmed and maybe a little confused when you get to the end of the game, after doing nothing but walk the entire way, you'll like Dear Esther. At the end of the game, I was left bored and a little disappointment. A beautiful environment I could do nothing with except look at it.  It was like a shiny new toy on a shelf, and I am a child that can't play with it. I wanted to explore but there was no reward for doing so. I spent what felt like ages exploring every nook and cranny, all for nothing. It wouldn't have taken as long if I didn't keep getting stuck on the environment.It has a great soundtrack, though.

												Dear Esther is filled with great ideas that would spell success for any major blockbuster, but falls short because only a few of those ideas were clearly thought out, and most poorly incorporated. Among Dear Esther's strong points are the lovely music and the beautiful graphics, some of the best I have ever seen. Howbeit, Dear Esther holds serious mechanical issues. While I am a huge fan of storytelling in video games, this plot is too thick and is impossible to follow. I was intrigued by the store page, but I finished this game more confused than when I started it. I'm still not sure who I (the controlled character) is, not to mention the moody narrator and only slightly Esther herself.  The best I can say is if you want a guided tour through beautiful terrain, this is a good game for you; otherwise, bounce some ideas around with other players on the plot and see what they think. Dear Esther is not a bad game, just shaken, not stirred.			",26,15,0,3,3,0,1

												Just finished this ""game"" because it was on my list and I'm trying to clear out my backlog. My intention was to not be too harsh when reviewing it, until i loaded up the game page and noticed that price...I wasn't expecting it to be any more than a couple of dollars, and even at that price point i don't think it's worth it. The game itself is pretty much an hour long story. It is absolutely beautiful, and i can tell there was some time put into the design of the game.That's the sad part about the whole thing though. It could have been so much more. I found myself pretty bored the whole way through, with the exception of a few moments where i thought something cool was finally starting to happen. There was a ghost at one point walking off into the distance, with some other little hidden things and references you had to look out for. I thought these parts pretty interesting, and brought me into the game. However, they simply don't happen often enough for it to make the game worth anywhere near the full price of $11.Overall, i feel my hour would have been better spent doing something else, and that doesn't even take into consideration the cost of purchasing the game.

And listening to a guy read a poem.It's not nessissarily bad, just not a game, and definitely not worth any money in my opinion.			",31,13,0,16,12,0,4

												The main character is an ill-fated English Literature professor with a British (or Australian? I don't know) accent, who dabbles in chemistry (ooo, ethanol) and in not speaking verbosely every time he opens his mouth. I disliked all of my English classes, and therefore found it hard to emotionally connect to the poor chap.			",476,230,8,57,34,4,46

												For what this is, a bit of a wander around some nice scenery while Sean Bean reads you some poetry, it isn't bad. However it is not a game so won't be for everyone. It was an experience but not one I plan to go through a second time. If you can pick this up in a sale then you might find it a pleasant diversion but at full price you may feel a bit conned because it won't take long to finish. If you are expecting any kind of gameplay other than moving from A to C via B then you will be disappointed.Do I recommend? Yes and no, see above for why, but ultimately more no than yes.

												Dear Esther isn't really a game, it's an interactive story (although there's not much to interact with). You press the WASD keys, follow the obvious path, and listen to your character narrate bits from a letter as you make your way towards the end. That's it, takes a little more than an hour.Now, the narrated lines from the letter are generated randomly, so if you play through the game multiple times, you'll be left feeling something different each time. Which is pretty cool. Unfortunately, the text relies too heavily on crappy metaphors in an attempt to be ""deep."" (In my only playthrough, the character talked way too much about kidney stones and syphillis). Dear Esther's only real redeeming quality - the absolutely beautiful graphics - are not enough to warrant a second playthrough from me though.In short, I suppose you might like Dear Esther if you don't feel like doing literally anything for 70m other than pressing the W key and listening to a story that tries too hard as an attempt to evoke emotion out of you. The only emotion it evoked in me, however, was an incredulity that I spent money and time on this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You think you know someone and then you find out they're a bird. This game was worth the money because I only bought it for a dollar a year ago during a steam sale. The only positive things I have to say about Dear Esther is that it had really pretty/eerie landscapes, a relaxing soundtrack, and only took an hour (any longer probably would have made me pull my hair out). I would only reccomend this ""experience"" if you like books on tape because it's just some English guy talking the entire time.Pro-tip- Tape down the ""W"" key when you play this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some people might call Dear Esther a work of art.  I can understand that argument, even if I don't agree with it.  It's certainly beautiful, and has a story to tell that's quite open to interpretation (as good art tends to be).  But at the end of the day, I can't recommend it, because it's not a game.  Input from the player is totally unnecessary, and it could just as easily have been made as a movie.  And despite the beauty, the trip is dull, with very long stretches of slow walking punctuated by occasional input from the narrator.  Don't bother.			",240,95,3,83,33,4,54

												This isn't so much of a game as a tech demo.  I played through it in 1.5 hours, and that was because I was taking my time.  There's no interacting with the environment at all.  It's entirely ""look but don't touch"".  The story line is interesting, but I wouldn't exactly call it engaging.  How can it be engaging without any interactivity?Given my choice, I wouldn't buy this again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't warn people off of this game enough.  I bought Dear Esther a while back during one of the Steam sales for $5 after glancing at the Metacritic score on the side which would lead you to believe this is a great game...I've never felt so cheated out of $5 in my life.  I knew I was in trouble when I brought up the options screen to check out the controls and the only things in the list were movement keys and zoom.  I'm pretty sure the only reason zoom was included was to give the illusion of some sort of interaction in the game and it turns out zoom is a joke since it gives all the magnification of having leaned forward 1 foot.  The ""gameplay"" involves you holding down W pretty much non-stop the entire time you're in the game while listening to a narrator occasionally ramble words at you that you could care less about.  Things would be marginally more tolerable if there was a run button or an auto-walk button.  But if they let you run, the game would only take 20 minutes, and adding auto-walk in there that would free up your hands to strangle the developers for taking your money, so they wouldn't want that.If you're still interested at all in this thing, do yourself a favor and just watch a Let's Play of it.  It shouldn't take long since it's only a couple of hours long.  You'll end up with the same exact experience of having played it yourself without the rage of knowing you paid for it.

												Its a beautiful and short programmed story.Thats really it, would I pay 10$ for this, probably not, when I acquired it through a humble bundle +3 other games for 1$, I feel like thats not enough for it. as someone put time into the game.If it where written into a book I feel like it would have been more worthwhile, which I'm sure the creators wouldn't want to hear but thats what it felt like, a well written novel.As for recommendation I'd say No, simply because theres not enough there.. there was no secret little items telling me of backstory on the character, or any collectables, It was just a walk through here and you'll see pretty things and hear a narrator explain the adventure.If a friend has it, watch/play it. If you invest in it, good for you supporting the creators of this game, and I hope they put a little more into the next one too make it more interactive.			",164,43,1,17,17,3,24

												The term ""walking simulator"" is really fitting for this game. Expect the w key to get a real workout. The only thing the game expects of the player is for them to keep moving forward. As for the story there isn't a whole lot to say. Each line of dialogue is randomized for a more unique experience each time. The story itself makes no sense and the writing is not interesting enough to hold up a game. The path you take is completely linear and the island itself has only a few interesting features. I would only reccomend this game because it graphically looks beautiful. Otherwise just avoid.			",74,19,0,11,8,2,5

												I'm not entirely sure what I expected from this game, other than the rather negative reactions I've already seen from it. To start off, I'm not at all against games that are story-driven, though it's as if this game tries way too hard to prevent the player from learning what the story of Dear Esther is. Mystisism can only go so far, and while it worked in games like The Legend of Zelda or Myst, this one is simply dull and uninteresting.There's nothing really motivating you to go on other than the fact that ""the game is short and I should beat it because I have an hour and a half to spare"". Personally, I just set the walk-speed to Gordon Freeman's speed and lessened the game about a whole hour by doing so - but do you see the issue there? The only thing making this game about an hour and a half long is the walking speed, and it's not worth the trouble. I understand that some games try to be deep and meaningful in their stories, but this is just crap. The Fibonacci spiral has nothing to do with the story, and you're going to be lucky if anyone catches the whole gasoline and alcohol chemical diagrams by the end. If you're trying to be cryptic, then make it so that the average player can understand. This is not exactly something that the common player will know off-hand, and with that, the story of this game becomes null and void.Some games make up for a horrible story with their gameplay, such as Doom, Far Cry 3 and Duke Nukem 3D. All of which work better without a story, as those would drive the game down as a whole. This game, however, has hardly a story to begin with, yet forces the player to simply hold down W for a good hour and a half. There is no gameplay here - and I'm not asking for much. Myst was a heavily story-based game that included logic-based puzzles and a secluded, mysterious atmosphere. The puzzles and exploration are what made that game a game, and it felt satisfying to logically find the answers to said puzzles. This game, has no gameplay whatsoever: no puzzles, no combat, no characters. Nothing. There's nothing motivating the average player to beat this game other than ""it can be beaten in two hours"", and anyone with a job or an active social life might just be appealed by that aspect alone, though it's two hours that could've been better-spent somewhere else.Much like Gone Home, this game has a great, eerie atmosphere that is gone to waste by the overall boring gameplay. The story isn't very good, and it really doesn't have much of a reason to play it more than once. There's no way I could recommend this game less to anyone.			",258,69,2,25,24,2,12

												It is a very beautiful game, visually, but that's about it.As I'm sure countless other reviews have mentioned, literally all you can do is walk around. You find your way around the island and eventually a story unfolds. Unfortunately, I didn't find that story deep enough or emotionally impactful enough to enjoy the game, want to play it again, or recommend it to anyone.If you want to wander around a Scottish island for a while and occasionally hear a narrated story, here you go. If you want any sort of interactivity, you won't find it here.			",120,116,0,41,59,0,34

												First of all, the most impressive feature of the game. It's more an audio-visual literary experience to relax the player than a game. I enjoyed the beatiful island's design and the ambience of music and sound.Unfortunately, the game is very short (after 1 hour you are through) and the story is fitting the scenario but has alot of passages in which it can't support the experience in the way the game obviously is supposed to transfer...If you are not a patient player, this game is definitely nothing for you. It has alot of passages in which NOTHING happens but walking. In general, you do nothing but walk, look and listen... seriously, there are no activities on this island! ^^As a relaxation after work, the game functioned perfectly for me, but I can't really recommend it.Overall, a 4/10, because I didn't experience a game like this before.

												What's my problem with Dear Esther? DE is the lazy version of Myst and Riven. Myst and Riven also had amazing stories and atmosphere. Can you imagine just walking around Myst and Riven while someone narrates the story without solving any puzzles? DE is made by story tellers -- good story tellers -- that refuse to understand how integrating gameplay into DE can actually enhance the experience and story the way it did for Myst and Riven. DE is lazy. DE is half the experience of Myst and Riven that were made basically 2 decades earlier. If you want to know more of why I have discovered that games like Dear Esther and To The Moon are a diservice to ""gaming"", read below:To The Moon is an example of a devolution in gaming. To The Moon is an example of video games giving less; degenerating into a worse state than what games have been in the past. Unfortunately, many act as if To The Moon is some revolutionary, innovative experience. It is not. It is the exact opposite. To The Moon does tell a very good (not classic, but very good) story. The story is original, which is more than most Hollywood productions can say. The characters are relatable, deep, and funny at the right time. The dialogue is well written. The plot twists are very well done. The music is remarkable. Yet, as I went through the story, I felt empty. I had this same feeling playing through Dear Esther. Everything I said above was also true about Dear Esther (To The Moon is basically the 2D 16-bit version of Dear Esther's approach). Then I realized why I felt empty.Every positive point about To The Moon I said above -- story, characters, dialogue, plot twists, music -- I had already experienced almost 2 decades earlier in Final Fantasy 6 except that -- FF6 actually had gameplay. And everything I experienced in Dear Esther I had also experienced almost 2 decades earlier with Myst and Riven except that -- Myst and Riven actually had gameplay.THAT is the problem. To The Moon is incomplete and lazy game design. To The Moon did what FF6 (and so many other 2D games) already accomplished in terms of story-telling -- which is fine, but the developer of To The Moon was too lazy or too blind to understand that gameplay is an essential part of gaming (and that gameply can actually enhance the story and experience like it did in FF6, Myst, and Riven). Instead of implementing gameplay into To The Moon that could enhance the experience and maybe make the story even more impactful, the developer chose to just have us walk around the world and watch the story unfold. Can you imagine walking around FF6, watching the story unfold without any gameplay? Without any RPG? That's exactly what To The Moon is. Can you imagine walking around Myst and Riven, listening to someone narrate the story wtihout any puzzles that perfectly integrate into the story and environment? That's Dear Esther.These are not games. They're interactive stories. And maybe if they called themselves interactive stories, I wouldn't be so harsh. But they don't. They stomp their feet and yell they are games. But they are not. They are interactive stories told by story tellers that, for whatever reason, didn't want to be bothered with implementing actual gameplay around their story to make it...ya know...a game. To the Moon and Dear Esther are ultimately empty, half-experiences that do half of what Final Fantasy 6, Myst, and Riven did two decades ago. They are an example of the devolutionization of ""games"" (HINT: because they're not games).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the games that really merits a ""meh"" for the recommendation, and here's why:Dear Esther is more of a work of art, an interactive experience, than it is a game of any sorts.  You basically have a sojourn through the environment as the story unfolds, and it's well done in the presentation.  However, your ability to interact with the environment is fairly limited.Is it worth getting?  If you are studying video games as a medium for art, then it's definitely worth taking a look at.If you want a game to play?  I'd say no, but YMMV.			",97,60,1,10,15,1,22

												I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that this would be more of a Myst-type game, where you explore and discover new things, but have some interactivity with the environment.  Instead, I found it to be more of a walk-through-the-beautiful-environments-with-haunting-music-while-an-unseen-narrator-talks-at-you game.  It's beautiful, atmospheric, and has pretty (if not extremely eerie) music, but it feels less like a *game* and more like an extremely depressing virtual tour.  I feel that I wasted my money on it, and my only consolation is that I got it on sale for $3.74, not full price.  While it is beautiful, and could be considered ""art,"" I would not consider it a ""game.""			",29,10,0,8,2,0,2

												I am not the target audience of this game. The problem is, I truly don't believe that most gamers are the target audience of this game. I would say spoiler alert, but there's is nothing here for me to spoil. The game offers a beutiful environment, and from what I rememer, a good soundtrack. and the good ends there. To me, it is almost as if this game is incomplete, as there is no gameplay, and the story is so disjoint and cryptic I'm not sure it can be called a story. Now I now that some people have their things that they get and they like that few others do. to them, I say enjoy this game then, as I do not grasp what you do about this game. For me, it really does oil down to the sarcstic label of ""walking simulator."" 2/10			",335,120,3,46,32,5,62

												To sum my review in one word: dissapointment.I was expecting this game to be like Journey (for ps3) but in fact this is just a walking simulator. All you do in this game is walk (slowly) and thats basically all.Key features section of game page is missleading. (1) ""Every play-through a unique experience, with randomly generated audio, visuals and events."" - there are no events in this game! You just walk - nothing is happening in this dead island and you cant interact with the enviroment at all. (2)"" Explore Incredible environments"" - you dont explore sh*t because game is fully linear and your job is to follow that linear path, nothing more. (3) ""A poetic, semi-randomised story ..."" - there is no story in this game. Only piece of information you will get from game is your characters incoherent blabber (unless that was intended to be story).Another problem is game length - it will take you about one hour to finish it.Only positive thing in this game was the caves level. It is one of the most beautiful levels i have ever seen in a video game.I bought this game on 75% discount but even as such i dont think it was worth buying it. There are games that will give you more fun for the same amount of money. ",44,14,0,9,1,0,4

												First of all, It's very pretty. It's also mysterious and somewhat creepy. With the good things out of the way, I can't really recommend this game. The biggest issue is that there is really nothing to do. You walk through the game and look at things. There's no interaction with anything. The only challenge is figuring out which path takes you to the next scene. It's done in an hour or so and there's not much replay value. If this were a demo, it would be fine but not as a full product.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, the most impressive feature of the game. It's more an audio-visual literary experience to relax the player than a game. I enjoyed the beatiful island's design and the ambience of music and sound.Unfortunately, the game is very short (after 1 hour you are through) and the story is fitting the scenario but has alot of passages in which it can't support the experience in the way the game obviously is supposed to transfer...If you are not a patient player, this game is definitely nothing for you. It has alot of passages in which NOTHING happens but walking. In general, you do nothing but walk, look and listen... seriously, there are no activities on this island! ^^As a relaxation after work, the game functioned perfectly for me, but I can't really recommend it.Overall, a 4/10, because I didn't experience a game like this before.

												What's my problem with Dear Esther? DE is the lazy version of Myst and Riven. Myst and Riven also had amazing stories and atmosphere. Can you imagine just walking around Myst and Riven while someone narrates the story without solving any puzzles? DE is made by story tellers -- good story tellers -- that refuse to understand how integrating gameplay into DE can actually enhance the experience and story the way it did for Myst and Riven. DE is lazy. DE is half the experience of Myst and Riven that were made basically 2 decades earlier. If you want to know more of why I have discovered that games like Dear Esther and To The Moon are a diservice to ""gaming"", read below:To The Moon is an example of a devolution in gaming. To The Moon is an example of video games giving less; degenerating into a worse state than what games have been in the past. Unfortunately, many act as if To The Moon is some revolutionary, innovative experience. It is not. It is the exact opposite. To The Moon does tell a very good (not classic, but very good) story. The story is original, which is more than most Hollywood productions can say. The characters are relatable, deep, and funny at the right time. The dialogue is well written. The plot twists are very well done. The music is remarkable. Yet, as I went through the story, I felt empty. I had this same feeling playing through Dear Esther. Everything I said above was also true about Dear Esther (To The Moon is basically the 2D 16-bit version of Dear Esther's approach). Then I realized why I felt empty.Every positive point about To The Moon I said above -- story, characters, dialogue, plot twists, music -- I had already experienced almost 2 decades earlier in Final Fantasy 6 except that -- FF6 actually had gameplay. And everything I experienced in Dear Esther I had also experienced almost 2 decades earlier with Myst and Riven except that -- Myst and Riven actually had gameplay.THAT is the problem. To The Moon is incomplete and lazy game design. To The Moon did what FF6 (and so many other 2D games) already accomplished in terms of story-telling -- which is fine, but the developer of To The Moon was too lazy or too blind to understand that gameplay is an essential part of gaming (and that gameply can actually enhance the story and experience like it did in FF6, Myst, and Riven). Instead of implementing gameplay into To The Moon that could enhance the experience and maybe make the story even more impactful, the developer chose to just have us walk around the world and watch the story unfold. Can you imagine walking around FF6, watching the story unfold without any gameplay? Without any RPG? That's exactly what To The Moon is. Can you imagine walking around Myst and Riven, listening to someone narrate the story wtihout any puzzles that perfectly integrate into the story and environment? That's Dear Esther.These are not games. They're interactive stories. And maybe if they called themselves interactive stories, I wouldn't be so harsh. But they don't. They stomp their feet and yell they are games. But they are not. They are interactive stories told by story tellers that, for whatever reason, didn't want to be bothered with implementing actual gameplay around their story to make it...ya know...a game. To the Moon and Dear Esther are ultimately empty, half-experiences that do half of what Final Fantasy 6, Myst, and Riven did two decades ago. They are an example of the devolutionization of ""games"" (HINT: because they're not games).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the games that really merits a ""meh"" for the recommendation, and here's why:Dear Esther is more of a work of art, an interactive experience, than it is a game of any sorts.  You basically have a sojourn through the environment as the story unfolds, and it's well done in the presentation.  However, your ability to interact with the environment is fairly limited.Is it worth getting?  If you are studying video games as a medium for art, then it's definitely worth taking a look at.If you want a game to play?  I'd say no, but YMMV.			",97,60,1,10,15,1,22

												This game feels forced, like it was trying hard to be something interesting or different, but for me at least it failed to be anything. While playing there are moments where you feel like your playing a MYST game when you arrive at a beautiful scene that invokes a sense of mystery and curiosity which is great as the scenes are beautifully crafted. Most of the time though the bland scenery and dull (though well written) dialog is all you have to keep you going. So for most people you will probably be wishing your character could run (there is a story reason he can't).People are still debating if this is actually a game, well it isn't, it is a audiobook of a story that has no real meaning or significance unless you are someone who has been in the same situation as the protagonist or if your someone who suffers from depression.SUMMARY if your looking for an audiobook containing a dull story you need to walk through some pretty scenery to advance then this is the game for you.

												Oh I had high hopes for this game. After playing Gone Home and The Stanley Parable, I was looking forward to playing another short game with a great experience. This is not that game. I hate the term Walking Simulator but that describes this game perfectly. Literally no exploration, you just walk along a path as the game narrates some passages from letters written to Esther. When the guy was reading the third letter and I was still trodding along at a slow pace with no end in sight, I knew I was in trouble because I didn't even care for the story at that point. I stuck with it to see it through since it's less than an hour long. For $10 :/  If the story was half as interesting as the game is pretentious, this would be one of the greatest games of all time.			",128,74,5,10,7,1,2

												Dear Esther is an interactive adventure that stands on the edge of what can be considered a ""game"". The entire experience consists of walking around an island, exploring it, and hearing pieces of a story from the narrator.This is absolutely a game for explorers. Much of the appeal of this game is simply taking in the beautiful landscapes and letting your curiosity guide you. This game is incredibly, ridiculously slow. You can only move at a slow walking pace, and for me, the amount of time it took me to get anywhere ended up discouraging me from trying to do much more exploration than what was needed. The music is nice, and it's appropriate for a lonely island.There's a lot to discover with the story, and Dear Esther intentionally leaves many questions unanswered. Personally, I found the story to be too boring to care about, so I had little interest in teasing out the game's many mysteries.This game is absolutely not for everyone. It's an interesting thing to think about and discuss, but there's little fun to be had with the game itself. The people who enjoy this game will love it passionately, though. If you would enjoy a super-slow, thoughtful experience, then maybe you'll like this. Then again, I normally do, and I feel ambivalent about this game. Don't buy Dear Esther unless it's cheap.

												I can't warn people off of this game enough.  I bought Dear Esther a while back during one of the Steam sales for $5 after glancing at the Metacritic score on the side which would lead you to believe this is a great game...I've never felt so cheated out of $5 in my life.  I knew I was in trouble when I brought up the options screen to check out the controls and the only things in the list were movement keys and zoom.  I'm pretty sure the only reason zoom was included was to give the illusion of some sort of interaction in the game and it turns out zoom is a joke since it gives all the magnification of having leaned forward 1 foot.  The ""gameplay"" involves you holding down W pretty much non-stop the entire time you're in the game while listening to a narrator occasionally ramble words at you that you could care less about.  Things would be marginally more tolerable if there was a run button or an auto-walk button.  But if they let you run, the game would only take 20 minutes, and adding auto-walk in there that would free up your hands to strangle the developers for taking your money, so they wouldn't want that.If you're still interested at all in this thing, do yourself a favor and just watch a Let's Play of it.  It shouldn't take long since it's only a couple of hours long.  You'll end up with the same exact experience of having played it yourself without the rage of knowing you paid for it.

												Visually Beautiful but Conceptually DivisiveThe debate centers around not the games quality but it's standing as a game at all. Fortunately for a review there is no reason to wade into this but the reasons why there is a debate come down to the fundamentals of what this game is. Skin deep Dear Esther is simply a story told to as you wander around an empty island, exploring abandon structures and glowing caves.It is important to understand this before playing this game, you will not be physically interacting in any way, this is all about the story.So how is the story? Well, frankly I found it a little pretentious and overly vague but those are things that it uses to draw in some people. While I gained very little from the experience others have found much more depth, including some hidden secrets on the island, and this is where any merit this game has will be. Each time you play the game you will get different parts of the story which is an ok mechanic but in Dear Esther it flounders for two reasons. First of the world doesn't really change in any significant way so visually multiple play thrus quickly become rote, despite the impressive graphics. The second, and related flaw is the dismal movement speed which means way to much time is spent walking in silence. I can not recommend modifying the game to allow for increased movement speeds if you decide to play this game (a quick search will give plenty of results for easy ways to do this).If you're the kind of person that loves digging into and trying to find the meaning in vague stories but aren't looking for the interaction seen in most games then Dear Esther will be something you really enjoy. Otherwise you'll probably want to pass.

												It is a very beautiful game, visually, but that's about it.As I'm sure countless other reviews have mentioned, literally all you can do is walk around. You find your way around the island and eventually a story unfolds. Unfortunately, I didn't find that story deep enough or emotionally impactful enough to enjoy the game, want to play it again, or recommend it to anyone.If you want to wander around a Scottish island for a while and occasionally hear a narrated story, here you go. If you want any sort of interactivity, you won't find it here.			",120,116,0,41,59,0,34

												Be VERY clear about what kind of a game this is before buying it. A hour long walk through some decent looking scenery with a narrator so vague and non-linear that it might be a parody of overly artsy indie game story telling.Do you enjoy 4 hour long black and white art movies about mute cripples trying to survive in the ruins of Warsaw with non-stop touching piano music? Then this might be the game for you, but it sure wasn't for me. Even for artsy people I'd probably recommend a Let's Play, since there isn't a whole lot of game aside from the atmosphere.

												I do not believe this game lived up to whatever hype it was given by those who loved it. This game, if it can even be called a game, is more like a virtual art gallery with narration provided at random points rather than a game to interact within. I can sort of get what they were trying to go for, but I still don't think it's worth the full price. If you can, and you're still curious do what I did: get it as part of a cheap bundle of games (ie the Humble Indie Bundle), play through it once just to satisfy your curiosity, and figure out for yourself whether it's really worth it.PS: I get that games can be art. I think Flower for PS3 was one of the greatest artistic experiences I've ever had in this medium.			",448,70,33,50,33,3,56

												Let me start off by saying that the only way to make Dear Esther playable is to increase the incredibly slow walking speed. First off you need to enable the developer console in the options and then while in game press the tilde key and type in de_playerspeed 300This will increase the walking speed by three times and makes it reasonable, however you will have to retype this command many times since the game will default to the slow walking speed each time it loads a segment.However this is absolutely necessary to get any type of enjoyment from the game, since there is absolutely no interactivity in the game the focus is on exploration, but there is nothing to explore here either and the short audio logs that you get from the narrator are so few that most of the time you're just walking doing absolutely nothing.This game makes the worst possible mistake you can make by trying to create a story focused game, it is absolutely short on story, so the question becomes why exactly would you want to spend your time playing a game that fails at its core element?3 / 10 (with increased walking speed)			",809,305,38,121,97,9,172

I understand the *tricky* meaning to this game, i get it.  its just not clever.  It thinks it is, but its really just a long winded story that ends with 1 more mechanic that pulls you straight out of the game and makes you wonder if your game bugged or if THAT is the real ending.  weak.

												This isn't really much of a game; rather, you walk around an island and are occasionally presented with some befuddling voiceovers contributing to a vague plot.  Good points are the music and the stunning scenery, but since you walk so slowly there is no real incentive to explore - not that you are able to stray far from the set path. You can easily complete the ""game"" in under an hour, but you'd basically get the same experience by watching a video playthrough.			",106,29,0,16,17,1,18

Lastly, take all items you could maybe have picked up, and glue them firmly to the ground. Maybe even chop off your own arms for good measure.What's left is basically just a decor, in a game verging on the noninteractive. This is the experience you get when playing Dear Esther.

												If you are intrested in this game, just play the free mod or watch it on Youtube.  This game tries way too hard to be deep and metaphorical, and just comes off as cheesy and nonsensical.  Honesty, I've played through it twice, and am still confused as to what is going on in the plot.  I was lured into this game under the promise of exploring a vast island, and while there is exploration, it is very linear.  I do have to praise this game for its visuals; the game looks especially nice in the cave sections.  In my opinion, I really dislike this game, and if you HAVE to buy it, get it for 75% off. Check out the Stanely Parable instead if you're into this 'genre' of games.			",100,30,1,16,11,1,10

												I want to love Dear Esther. I want to be one of those people that is moved by the story it tells, that is transported to another world while playing it.But I'm not.Here are some of the reasons why:-There's an unnatural slowness forced onto your movement. Walking fifty feet takes about five times longer than it should. I guess this is to force you to appreciate the scenery, but all it did for me was make me impatient.-The story did not register with me. I was interested, but I wasn't invested beyond ""Huh, wonder what's going to happen.""...That's all I have, actually. It's not a bad game. I'm not even sure it is a game, but if it is, it's not a bad one. I just don't recommend it. Go play Gone Home or Braid if you're looking for a fun indie game that will touch your soul, or go play... Skyrim? Skyrim has some pretty scenery. Yeah, go play Skyrim if you're looking for eye candy.Or, you know, go for a walk outside. But that's just silly, I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics are beautiful, the music is captivating and the story is intriguing. Unfortunately, these are pretty much the only thing Dear Esther has going for it. And even then, the story something pieced together from random bits of narration and cryptic items that lay out of place in the environment. I spent about 90 minutes playing this game and then had to stop for the night, right before what I presume to be the ending. Upon restarting the game, I found that I was not given the option to skip ahead to the final chapter (although there is a chapter selection screen). The prospect of playing through the game again seemed like nothing more than a chore. I can't recommend a game I can't bring myself to finish, especially one that doesn't even have any sort of challenges.			",370,140,10,71,45,5,66

A game requires interactivity via mechanics and a visual narrative that unfolds before you to communicate a specific feeling or idea. There is none. It tries to create a story by giving vague hints at some kind of tragic crash via the narrator's thesaurus attempt at poetry and its attempt is laughable.

That might have actually been fine, if I had been able to glean any level of enjoyment from the story being told, but it proved to be far too difficult for me to care about anything the narrator was saying as I trudged at the same laborious and deliberate pace.  I can say that a few of the areas looked pretty at least, especially those areas with more color (as opposed to the dullest greens and grays of the rock faces you spend most of your time walking across.

												So um... it's really beautiful graphics wise, music and narration... but it's not a game. It's more like a 1 hour tour into an island with someone narrating. It should have been a short movie or... something other than a game. It reminds me of a book I once read, though at least I understood the plot of the book. Here? I don't get it. I find it difficult to appreciate plots I don't understand. Hard to give a rating of a non-game as well...			",93,57,2,29,6,2,25

												While the story is interesting at first, it becomes a bit convuluted as the ""game"" goes on. But, do to its lack of any sort of interactivity, the experience becomes a bit of a drag as the game goes on. While there are some beautiful areas at some points, such as in the cave, due to the repetetive nature of the island, the above ground sections can become monotomous. If you have any interest of buying it, wait untill it is on sale. The game can be beaten in a bit over an hour and there is little replay value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther is unlike any game I have played. It has beautiful scenery, coupled with an intrigueing story. Sadly, that is all it has. There is no game play. You simply walk along trails, view the amazing scenery, and listen to a story.So in short, if you want to hear a masterfully written story for an hour, whist wandering possibly the most gorgeous enviroments the Steam Engine currently has to offer -- buy it.If you expect this game to be more than simply walking around (Ex. Puzzles, mystery solving) you will be let down. My suggestion is you should youtube the whole game. You get the same story, without the cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Firstly, despite the store page telling you it's a game, it's not. It's a relatively linear short story told as you wander rather slowly along a mostly predefined path across an island. It's short, there's basically no interactiveness to it (I mean there are additional plot elements in the scenery but you can't do anything with them, or even see them clearly quite often) and the walking speed is at times painfully slow. Having said that if you just go with the flow, the story is haunting, the atmosphere is captivating. I'm just left with the nagging sensation that it could have been so much more... If you get it in the humble bundle it's worth a play through. If not, I would probably just watch a play through on youtube.			",202,163,1,25,7,1,20

												This one of the few times that I feel players get a better experience seeing a game video than actualy playing it. I feel that this game would be better as a movie than as a game. Simply moving forward and letting players feel like they have control does not make it a game. It is a movie where the player controls the camera.That said the game looks amazing and the soundtrack has some of my favorite tracks. But it is hard to call this a game rather than an interactive movie. Buy the soundtrack but watch a playthrough instead of playing.			",119,30,0,30,11,1,29

												I never really knew what ""walking simulator"" meant until Dear Esther.  This isn't a ""game"" by any definition, but more of a ""narrated experience"".  There is no open world to explore.  The player presses the forward key and travels along a path until arriving at the destination.  While the path may diverge at some point, it will converge a short time later.The game has a nice atmosphere with magnificent graphics, appropriate sound effects, and some well-done music.  However, I didn't find the story or the locations all that compelling.  The whole experience was also incredibly short--a mere 1.5 hours--and because of this I believe the asking price of $10 simply absurd.  There are many other titles that are interactive and replayable that sell for the same or less.  I purchased this game during a Steam sale for $2 and, in all honesty, I still think I may have paid too much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful to look at and killer sound track. However, the ending ruins it. Only buy this if you really don't care about good story telling. The amount of love that went into the visual details breaks my heart because they are incredible. I want to be able to explore this island forever. The story starts out really interesting and contains compelling components that just get left unexplored. The music is wonderful and compliments the visuls perfectly.It's just a bad story and the more the game (I use the term loosely because this is more of just a visual story than somethign you play) went on the less i cared about the main character and his story.I wish this was a bit more exploratory and a bit less cheesy.

												This ""game"" is really interactive art. And by interactive I mean you can wander around, there's not anything in the world you can really interact with. As you wander you occasionally get some vague dialogue tells a little bit more about the story. This dialogue is apparently somewhat randomized, but the main story doesn't change, just some of the unimportant details.The graphics are good, especially in the caves. The levels are mostly linear with few side paths and fewer alternate routes, limiting the sense of exploration. The story is intentionally vague and open to interpretation with an ending that shows that the whole island isn't actually real. It goes right along with the interactive art aspect so it's not a negative for me.The big issue with this game that prevents me from recommending it is the price relative to how short the game is. Look at my playtime, that's how long it took to play through with backtracking to see all the side paths. At least I got this as part of a bundle because it's not worth $10, at most it might be worth $2.50 on a 75% off sale, and even then only if you're into this kind of game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming into this, I realized it was not a game persay, more of a walking simulator/narrative. That being said, it was still disappointing. I only spent $1.99 on it and the playthrough took about 2 hours. It would have been far less if the game allowed you to run. The graphics were ok, but not amazing like those in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. The music was good, when it was present. Not particularly fun or thought provoking. Unless you can get it for less than $2, I wouldn't bother.			",139,57,1,22,15,1,29

There are many modders out there who contribute much greater, albeit different, efforts for free. Whether intentional or not, putting it up here on steam was awfully misleading and tricked many into buying it, believing it is an actual adventure game. At least everyone I know who bought the game, including myself, sprung that trap.It is an insult to all modders out there that this ""game"" is being sold.

												If you buy this, you will want your money back.  It is a video of a location, that's all.  Imaging a video of a deserted island at night, paired with  portions of an audio book, then chop up the audio book into small non-logical sequences.  There is a mystery story with creepy music, a disjointed and non-sensical story.  However you cannot hear the entire story until you have roamed around this island with monotonous backdrops.  The most exciting thing were the mushrooms in the cave which always pointed at you.  DO NOT buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't really much of a game; rather, you walk around an island and are occasionally presented with some befuddling voiceovers contributing to a vague plot.  Good points are the music and the stunning scenery, but since you walk so slowly there is no real incentive to explore - not that you are able to stray far from the set path. You can easily complete the ""game"" in under an hour, but you'd basically get the same experience by watching a video playthrough.			",106,29,0,16,17,1,18

												It's very much my fault for failing to do the proper research on this title. I was lured by the prospect of searching through elder sites, buildings, and even realms, all the while evading or confronting spectral anomalies, personalities, forces. But I walked into a veritable smorgasbord of monotany with this game. Now it may be surprising for some to find that 'walked' is the key word here, oddly enough. For walking is the only aspect of this game which gives it a first-person shooter feel. One stands upright and observes the world in such a manner. But the interactivity of this world ends there. A story unfolds, but it's all recollection by the player's character and meant to evoke through this speech and a host of visuals one must slog through oh-so-slowly.Walking simulator. That's what this is. And I just don't quite jive with this type of play. Because I couldn't stand the stagnancy of this title I can't say if there is a real theme in the game; man vs. man, or is it man vs. nature?Grab it if you like to feel serenity brought on by an environment laced with subtly charming, vocalized story-telling. I for one can just go meditate. Any and all FPS games I play are gonna have to be rambunctious, energetic, whitty, and compell me to fight for something. This does none of that.Forgive me, I meant first-person shooters...which this is not. <sigh> So as I relive my mistake, please take into account the difference and enjoy. ;)			",134,15,2,3,3,0,9

												This game certainly has some good writing and the graphics are decently done. But the whole thing is just too vague and small. There’s not much reason for the player to really become emotionally involved with any of the characters because you only hear about what happened with small bits of metaphor thrown around the environment. I don’t feel like anything solid forms before it’s over. It's certainly lacking in substance. Honestly, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a much better game if you are looking to explore an environment and be fed a story. It looks ten times better, has a story which you can follow, and has enough interaction to involve the player in the story. You should spend your money on that instead of this.

												If games were interactive art paintings, this would be one of my first experiences.  Unfortunately, I didn't like it.  Other than just walking through a world and observing, there really isn't anything to do in this game.  It's beautiful, but it's not worth paying your money for.  Maybe someone elses money, but not yours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I walked through the game in some 70 minutes. At the end of it, the story did not make any sense, as if all the narrative was random and inconclusive. I think I made mistakes by choosing the paths that are pretty much the shortest pathways to the next ""level"" in the game so I probably missed a lot of narrative that would connect the story and explain it a bit deeper. However, I had no clue I was doing just that, and the game did not lead me to find more information in any way.I feel a short amount of time I spent playing the game is a waste, because I have no idea about what was the point of the story or whether it was me who was the narrator or somebody else.I have to admit that I did get the chills at the final scene, only to realize *** BEGIN SPOILER *** that I was not actually throwing myself onto the cliffs but that I had become a gull (I guess, I'm not sure about that as well). *** END SPOILER ***Unfortunately, since I have no wish to replay the game, this final detail is not enough to recommend playing this experience (it's not really a video game, you're not doing any interactions with the environment).

												This game has really gotten too much exposure for what it is.I feel the pruposfully vague spits of narration have created a sense of depth and allure for many which just isn't there in the story. As I moved slowly (and I would like to impress the meaning of SLOWLY here) around the island, I just was not instilled with the emotion the game was trying to project due to the distraction of grinding pace and trying to search for something more.I don't want to spoil the the story here but the concept is as basic as you imagine so just relax on a playthrough.God does this ever need a run button.

												You are just supposed to walk forward while you are told a story.  That's it.  That might have actually been fine, if I had been able to glean any level of enjoyment from the story being told, but it proved to be far too difficult for me to care about anything the narrator was saying as I trudged at the same laborious and deliberate pace.  I can say that a few of the areas looked pretty at least, especially those areas with more color (as opposed to the dullest greens and grays of the rock faces you spend most of your time walking across.  Anyway, I do not recommend this game.			",260,65,4,17,18,1,24

												I'm kind of torn by having to choose either 'yes' or 'no' to the question whether to recommend this or not. It's not at all a bad game. It looks nice, it's atmospheric in every way I can imagine, and the story can feel touching or deep. However, it's a very short experience, has very little actual gameplay or replay value, and the story is just a bit too messy for my taste. Maybe you'll like it, who knows, and to an extent, even I did. I think it's too vague.I like writing long texts but I really don't know what else to tell about this. I'd really like to recommend this but at best, I can say that you should experience this at least once. Still, I can't recommend buying it due to its short duration and the flaws I mentioned above. Confused? So am I.			",190,34,3,22,22,1,56

												This is a very good technical demo : a bunch of great looking scenery, quite well done voice acting and.... that's it. The game is a walking simulator which lasts about an hour and a half (only because the character you are controlling walks at the pace of a sloth). Things that i wouldn't mind if the game wasn't 8 euros.I didn't even mention the awful writing and story, it doesn't have anything really smart to say and feels very pretentious. The best comparison would be the movie ""The Tree of Life"". I heard peaople comparing this to the Stanley Parable which it has absolutely nothing to do with, this game is less fun, telling it's (really bad) story in a less smart way, more linear and in the end less interesting.If you see this at 80% off buy it and play it whith your own music in the background just for the visuals, otherwise if you want a game with gloomy athmosphere a good story and actual gameplay just buy Alan Wake.

												I don't see the appeal of walking sims.  The defining feature is that it contains as little as possible in the way of interactive elements.  What about failing to meet the standards of the medium one is working within makes a game more artistic?  For me, the interactive elements are the entire reason games are such an interesting artistic medium to begin with.  The inability to use them in synergy with the narritive is nothing to be praised.This is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			",214,76,5,32,24,1,23

												It's graphically pleasant and a nice ""interactive story"" somewhat, but it needed more to it in my opinion.

For a game to be 100%'d in less than an hour is a bit underwhelming. Once again though, it's definitely interesting.			",74,28,2,4,4,1,8

Buggy!I just spent a few hours in my darkened room with this game and got really pulled into it. The overall mood and atmosphere, the emotions behind the unraveling story... I quite enjoyed it and was in fact so gripped that I even forgot to save, since you can't really die anyway.It was bound to happen, I ran into a glitch. I got stuck between a few pebbles on the beach and couldn't get out again. Eventually in desperation I pressed F7 (fast load)... and had to restart from a point where I had been several hours before! No autosave had been happening in between, even though there were transitions between chapters with loading times.This pretty much ruined my experience and left me nothing but frustrated. Maybe I'll start again but not in the near future. I might just just watch a Let's Play instead, that's safer.My advice if you play Dear Esther: Stick to the laid out paths! Don't try to cross or climb things. And always quick save! (F6)			",303,98,7,37,22,2,54

If you're looking for a game, where you get to actually do things, Dear Esther is really not it.One of tags is ""Walking Simulator"" for a good reason. You walk. That's it. You ""explore"" some coastal area, while regularly listening to the narrator telling you a story. This game is more akin to and audiobook than your usual game.I got this from HumbleBundle.

												tried to appreciate this game as a 'visual novel', but it really wasnt that enjoyable even if you approach it like that.many of the art assets are reused dozens if not hundreds of times despite not being a particularly large map area. the game is about as visually impressive as skyrim, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you like skyrim. just don't exepct this to impress you with its modeling.the story comes on far too strong. you couldn't get to the end of the game without being painfully aware of the story without playing blind and mute or being five years old. the game shoves the story down your throat without any attempt at letting the 'reader' discover the story through connections in a natural fashion. instead it is plainly showed to you and later said in blunt words. the game's story treats you like a child. apparently portions of the story are different between playthroughs, but i honestly cant find myself caring enough about the story to actually look at the slight variations.this game seemed to have some potential, but it seems it was made far too simple and short for me to really enjoy. if more work had been put into making the island visually unique (not repetitive mushrooms, rocks, grass, dirt, etc..) and the story had seemed less patronizing i would be willing to call this a good game.

												The first thing that you should know is that this game looks amazing.  The lighting is beautiful, the water looks great, and the environment has a real character.However, into this world, the designers have created 30 minutes of story stretched into 1.5 hour of gameplay for which they charge you as if there's 10 hours of content.  I mean, think of the games that you can get for $10: Gone Home, Limbo, Trine, Terraria, FTL, Braid, Portal, Binding of Isaac, and on and on and on.There are a couple of niggles with the game.  The path frequently bifurcates, and there's usually no clear or easy way to get from one path to the other.  So, if you're a completionist and want to hear all of the naration, there's a lot of back tracking in order to see everything.  Also, there's a lot of stuff painted onto cave walls and like, but the writing is sometimes nearly indecipherable, so I found myself just ignoring off of it, which detracts from the atmosphere of the game.Bottom line: if you can pick this up for a couple bucks, it may be worth it, but I can't say that I got much out of playing it.

I'm supposed to be moved... and maybe it makes me a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... but quit the pity party.  If your life really does suck so much, go devote your time and energy to making the world a better place ... volunteer at a soup kitchen or something.So disappointing to find a game that initially heartens with beautiful rendering of the British coastline (a place so much like so many places I've hiked) only to find that 45 minutes later I am so utterly disappointed with a glorification of suicide.  Was that supposed to be a surprise ending?The only surprise was that it actually ended so predictably. Sure, it's ""original"" for a game... but not for poorly written angst that you couldn't get published in book form... about on par with the works I had to read by classmates in the creative writing class I took in college. If only they had enabled SHIFT-W and allowed me to run, then I'd have only wasted as 20 minutes of my evening instead of 45.If it is any consolation, it seems the rest of the team was extremely talented, but if this is what passes for ""games as art"", we're doomed.

												This is not a good game. This is not a good story. This is not a good experience. The first problematic thing with the game is the story, and since the whole game is simply telling a story, this is a bad start. What is the main issue? Namely, that parts of the story are random, meaning there is no cohesive narrative, and it doesn't matter. The narrator's voice is as interesting as a bowl of brown mold sitting in a cardboard box. Movement is far too slow, and there's not a lot to look at. It's an island with paint cans, seagulls, and scribbles. That is it. No replay value despite the 'multiple stories', and a waste of a dollar and change.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll start this review by saying I do really enjoy games with artistic themes, games where symbolism is interwoven with the narrative and gameplay elements. Games like Silent Hill, Amnesia, or even more 'artsy' stuff like To The Moon are all great experiences which manage to couple symbolism and meaning with effective game design.But in Dear Esther's case, there's absolutely zero gameplay, even when compared to most other art games. It's not just that you can't run, jump, or shoot, it's that you literally cannot affect *anything* in your environment.You can't pick anything up, can't touch or examine anything, and the only things to discover beyond the extremely linear path the game devs want you to travel are vast, empty areas, or occasionally, death. The only thing to do in this game is walk along a set path, listening to snippets of disjointed, over-written narrative that at times comes off like a parody of bad poetry. As for the plot itself, it's really not all that deep or meaningful; once you've managed to dig through the layers of purple prose and forced metaphors, the 'big reveal' is about as anticlimactic and cliched as any you'll see in most games.I know this game gets a lot of praise just for trying something different, and I do admire that, but different doesn't always mean good, and in this case, I'd argue that it was a failed experiment.

												First part is agonizing, looks kinda silly, and just flat out ""wtf am I doing?""I was ready to just explore this island, and sniff the flowers, without a real goal.It would be fine if the plants weren't just cookie cut 2d pixlated copy-pasta.If they actually put a model for bags, instead of just painting them on the ground.If they gave me the possability to yell out when I heard a wierd sound, or try to climb a rock, to get to a higher place.The game doesn't even reward exploration, it actually makes you feel stupid for trying to explore.It's just liniar, you walk along a beach, as a guy talks.At least that's what happening so far. But then you get to the second part. You fall down the cave.Now it's like ""wow, wtf just happened? Everything is so beutiful all of a sudden"", go around looking at everything and getting the feeling in of being in this mystical place.Then you get out of the cave, and it's kinda ""okay, what now, I walk along the beach again but at night, walk up the hill, wtf is with all the writing on the wall""And then the ending. It just makes you smile. This satisfieing dumb-happy smile.I still dont really get the story though.The way I understood it, was that main character was the one writing all the things on the walls, and putting all the lights.and he had a friend, who was.. the island itself?In the end he was 'set free' as a bird, and symbolic paper ships that represented the people who had died on the island float around.If I could walk faster, I would play through it again..

												This ""game"" really disappoints me.I respect art, but art in gaming needs to be interactive. Like Antichamber or Stanley Parable for example.In this game you can do *NOTHING*. You can only walk around and klick Mouse1 to zoom.It's cute that this game wants to tell a story, but all i see in this game is a slow motion walk through a few different environment s (pretty beautiful grahpics for source engine, though) with attended poetic phrases.Overall I can't undestand the hype around this game. If you like boring stories and looong walks without ANY interaction, this game is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From the reviews I read, I was expecting more from this. For an hour long game of just walking and narration, i'd expect to become enthralled into the story very quickly, not half way through it.Graphically it has it's moments, but overall, for a game known for it's looks, it sure aged quickly.If it goes on sale for under $5, and you need an hour to waste, go for it, otherwise you can leave it for the wolves.

												The scenery was beautiful and the music was lovely. However, there wasn't enough going on visually to connect with the story. It was like going for a walk while listening to an audio book. The book might be good and it might be a beautiful day out but the two don't necessarily need to be enjoyed together. I ended up not knowing anything about the story by the end and I'm pretty sure I missed a good chunk of it because I took a wrong turn. It might have been a good story but I don't think that it needed to be told through a video game -- the interactivity of a game added nothing to the story because there were so few visual clues as to what was going on and it was literally being told to me through a big block of text over my screen.

												Yeah, It got a Beautiful Landscape. Like the movie director, the scenes are perfectly shoot. Like a painting.Yeah, it has a super narrator. Similar to The Stanley Parable. But at the same time it's too bad narrated. And it's not the narrator; it's the narrators text and his way of upperclass, british english texting.In the end the story is just don't touching at all. It's to meta. Well for me it is not. If someone is touched by it, that's great. But for me it doesn't work out. I just heard that it is a kind of remake of a mod, but i think it's no excuse. It has to many flaws.And the price of 20 Euros is so above all. I bought it at a deal for 4 Euros and i think that this is kind of fair.			",253,88,8,16,15,0,38

												Check your video settings before you start. Mine were set to lower-than-native resolution, with poor filtering, no anti-aliasing, and the lowest shader setting. Whether or not the game experience appeals to you, you'll certainly get more out of Dear Esther if it looks as nice as it can.The game experience didn't entirely appeal to me. I couldn't help feeling impatient with the slo-o-ow walking speed - although this became more tolerable later in the game as the narrator's dialogue clips became more frequent, and as there was more visual interest. I was frustrated by invisible walls that stopped me climbing gentle slopes, and I would have liked more ability to climb over rocks and such (at one point I wanted to climb onto a ship wrecked on the beach, and was disappointed to find I couldn't). It's not always clear where you can and can't go in the game - frustrating, given how long it takes to get anywhere. The constraints on my ability to move quickly around the map discouraged me from thoroughly exploring the environment - a pity, since I'm sure I missed a lot of dialogue hidden off the beaten track.The narrative was okay, but not mindblowing. Grief is a little humdrum (unless it's yours). The music was nicely ambient; the environment was very pretty indeed - but I didn't really get immersed in the game. My loss, maybe?

												Dear Esther is a 94-minute-long walking simulator that bases itself entirely around telling a story.This would be great if it weren't for the fact that the story is really uninteresting.There exist similar games that work really well (i.e. Gone Home, The Beginner's Guide) because their stories actually captivate the player.This is a dull game in which you walk at 0.125mph and listen to a man talk.Play something like Gone Home instead.

												I had this in my wishlist for a long time, after playing the amazing Ethan Carter i was in search for a similar experience, no fighting, no other player just me learning the sotry as i go. This game however is not that, it features an intriguing island setting and it potentially has a sotry worth looking into. It is not feasable however to have an island of large size, with many paths and options and not, not have a sprint button or a sped up walking pace. There are places i want to see but the time it takes walking to any location is extremely off putting.I'm looking for a nice slower paced game but not this slow moving, i'm afraid it's a refund only and those who are looking for an amazing story experience please look at Ethan Carter.

												As many have pointed out already, this is not as much a game, as it is an experience. You don't interact with anything or anyone. You just... walk. You can't even turn the flashlight on or off by your own, the game will do it for you.This game is not about the gameplay, it's about the scenery, the music and the voice acting, which are all very well done. Especially the scenery combined with the music are stunning and is the main reason for why you should consider buying the game.With that said, I don't recommend this game. And the reason why, is that the story is barely understandable. Maybe I'm just too dumb, but there isn't really any red line through the game (except for the walking part). In other games like this, you can pick up things and explore the enviornment in a more detailed way, which adds to the story. I really like ""walking simulators"", but one thing they need for me to really like them, is a good story. And Dear Esther simply doesn't have one, atleast not one I understand. If you are comfrtable with a game that effectivly is a game made to take screenshots in because of the beatuiful scenery, then this is the game for you... For me, it's not enough. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worst thing i have ever experienced (in terms of interactive media) in my life. This is in no way a game, it is however an enviroment with a story. A pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥story, with the worst field of view ever.  Never in my life have i gotten motion sickness from playing a game before. even raising the field of view to the max didn't help. I rage deleted this game once, then felt guilty and read online that it only takes an hour on average to finish, so was like what the hell lets just push through the nausia to see what it offers. and i did. And boy was it lame. This game has some pretty scenes, i'll give it that. Again though the soundtrack is so boring. The voice actor has the enthusiasm of a dead leaf that used to exist. Oh and if you think you have the option to turn off the boring♥♥♥♥♥music and listen to literally anything while you walk on this abysmal desolate island, guess what, no music sound slider, just a freakin master volume... The only way i managed to finish this game without stabbing myself is by singing freakin rap music lyrics by DMX, i say this why, well because i'm a metal head and don't like most rap. Why is this important, well its more important because it tells you something about me which is alot more than this game does. And don't get me wrong, i knew it was a walking sim. I knew. And just for another TMI moment i like walking around Skyrim going from one hold to the next without fast traveling just because, and i really did not like this one bit. I think everyone can find a lot more enjoyment in simply going outside your house/building aand staring at your wall as you walk arround it.Note - If you are visually impared, you can play this. However your experience will vary depending on the type of imparement you have. Specifically issues with blind spots, peripheral vision, and central vision. There are things to read and spot in this envirmonet as well though i am not really sure if they do anything to enhance the experience.			",265,65,5,28,12,1,28

I didn't care to listen to the fellow emote all the same drivel while I slowly walked thru again, so I just watched a video of the ending, which I'm appauled at for the fact that it glorifies suicide.

												I do love some good ole fashion narrative, artistic, story driven games.  Though this one falls a little bit short.  The aesthetics are stunning, its a beautiful georgous world for as dreary as it is intended to be.  But there's something that doesn't click w/ the rest of it.   Maybe a better narrator? Maybe the dialogue just seems a bit too much forced poetic art to allow me to enjoy the story.  Conclusion, if you catch it on sale, or have 45 mins of time to take in existential themed art, I'd recommend it.  But something is just slightly off delivery wise that prevents Dear Esther from being great.			",92,34,2,21,27,0,10

												This isn't really a game, it's more like a visual story, where you're sort of along for the ride.   All you can really do is take your time travelling the paths on the island.    However the visuals are really beautiful.    You basically spend the time following paths while listening to the narrator of the story, but I found just looking at the scenery itself nice, due to the beauty of many of the areas you find yourself.

												So I wrote a snarky refview initially and thought better of it.  This is obviously something a lot of people enjoyed, but I could not wait for the end.  It's a movie or a short story trying to be a game, but I thought actually moving through the world (pushing forward on a controller for an hour) broke the immersion and made the story lose its impact.

												This game is an immersive poem. The randomized narration is reminiscent of David Lynch\'s Inland Empire; both present a mass of disjointed information to you and allow you to unconsciously connect the dots that have been blasted at you. It\'s a sort of sensory overload. And the haunting visuals and gorgeous audio all make for an incredibly atmospheric experience. It must be stated that this is specifically a walking simulator. Not a jumping simulator. Not a running simulator. Not a picking-up-breakable-mugs simulator. This is a walking simulator, and it\'s a damn good one.For anyone who likes Frost or Whitman, this game is worth the money. And the great graphics are not remotely demanding. My laptop lags when I drop a bomb in Garry\'s Mod on medium settings, yet I can run this game at max settings and not sense a remote dip in fps.There are a few things some players may miss. In the game one can see the silhouette of a person standing on the candlelit edge of a cliff. I assumed this was a statue, but upon reaching and later passing that location, I realized that whomever it was no longer was there.It\'s a wonderful, surreal little poem that presents itself as being full of choices and confusions, when really the path one follows is completely predestined (which is a theme the narrator understands, making the game just the right amount of self-aware). If you combine the visuals and controls of Drizzlepath with the narrative style of Serena, you have the wonderful Dear Esther, a game whose price is the same as my rating for it out of ten.

												It's a beautiful game, with an interesting narrative mechanic. The music is haunting and fits the mood of the game really well. The game however has barely any gameplay and is extremely short.So as an experience, I'd recommend it. Not at full price, definitely wait for a sale. But as a game, no way, I don't even consider it a game. It's more of an interactive experience.			",228,89,3,48,22,4,50

												An interactive story, do not expect any action whatsoever. All you do is walk and that's it.  The graphics are gorgeous and the story/dialogue is somewhat hard to understand and follow.  A relaxing, beautiful journey that most kids probably won't enjoy.  I love it so far and recommend it to anyone what wants a chill ""game"" that's very pleasing on the eyes.

												I loved this game. It is quite a difficult game to classify because you don't really interact directly with anything, you simply explore the island and as you do the story unfolds through the narration. The narration is great because it just tells you fragments of the story and as the game progresses the narrator's distinction between the parts of the story become more blurred but you start to form a clearer picture of the story. The design of the island is fantastic, it looks amazing, it is filled with many subtle details which tie in with the story and it leads your attention through the level without making you feel railroaded. It has surprisingly good replayablility because the narration is semi random meaning which details of the story you get will vary each time. Also the details of the things you find on the island also vary slightly each time. It is not a long game but it is not like any other game I can think of so it is well worth playing.

												Was very disappointed with this game - it really does feel like a walking simulator as there is no ability to interact with objects or examine anything of interest. While the music is beautiful and haunting, and the voice actor is emphatic and engaging, everything else about this really falls flat. I am a big fan of artistic games, but to me, this could have easily been a short film instead since there really is no use for you, as the 'player'. When realizing I couldn't actually examine anything, including all the littered items that are spread out around the island, I lost interest. The role you are left with is simply hitting forward and the occasional ""don't drown"" button. You don't even have control over your flashlight.I think art in the form of video games can really make an impact - when done right. This, for me, didn't hit that mark.While I appreciated the 'interesting' ending, I spent more time trying to work out if my computer had crashed than pondering whatever sort of philosphical thoughts it had intended to leave me with.

												It is great in what it wants to do. I loved the voiceacting, the writing and the soundtrack is amazing.Beside some nice optical impressions, the level design is very poor. There are no gameplay elements except walking. The ""game"" is very short. Thogh I appreciate the concept, the overall idea and very much embraced the atmostphere... it is overpriced, also regarding, that it is basically an HL-2 mod. All they did was create a rather empty island, put in some voiceacting (the writing might've taken 2 weeks, if they really put much effort into it) and added music. The graphics are not impressing and before I could really put my heart into the hands of the game, it was over, with a quite predictable ending aswell.I want to love it, but I can't. Do it again. Longer and harder.(I have waited for over 2 years for this to go into sale, and though I only payed half, I still thought about refunding it, bud didn't, hoping ""they"", would read and ackwnolidge this - I was also mad because the Soudtrack version did not go on sale, because that would've been worth my moeny.)

												Big caveat to this recomendation: I would honestly recommend it for the right person.  I just don't think there's many ""right persons"" for this.  I'd give the game a pretty decent rating, but this area of steam is for ""recommending"", not about ""rating"" the game.  I'd rate it good if I could, but that doesn't mean I recommend it (if that makes sense).Once I got over my impatience for slow pace and lack of apparent purpose of the game and just let the experience take hold, it was one of relaxation and interest.  The story is vague, cryptic, and ethereal.  I have a guess as to what it all means, but certainly could be wrong.  Kind of like if you look at an semi-abstract painting and attempt to derive meaning; you may well create your own fabricated meaning similar to or distinct from the artists.  Your are doing a virtual hike, seeing sometimes pleasant, sometimes awe inspiring scenes, while the story unfolds.  I would not call it a great story, but it's OK for one of it's style (previously mentioned).  I think this was one of the early story telling game, so give it props for it's innovation.  I see inspriration from the 1993 game Myst in it, but strip out the puzzles, make moving thorough the world akin to a modern day first person 3d environment, and add in a narrative paragraph from time to time as you walk.  But there are much better story telling games out there.  While you can tell a lot of care went into environmental design, and the other nuances, there really would only have been a small fraction of effort put into the development of this game as similarly priced alternatives.  But the fact that there's really no ""game"" in this ""game"" meant the developer took a risk, which is respectible.  It took just shy of 2 hours taking my time and exploring quite a few of the nooks and crannies, but not all of them (while eating a meal).  So back to the recommendation:  - It's a good game, but not for everyone - - It's not really a game, and interactive story - - - It's not really a story, it's just a peaceful journey - It's not as deep as the praise would lend it (to my perception, and the perception of many others it seems) - It's peaceful - There's much better, newer, options for this style of game - The game has a good deal of value from game-history, and gaming-trends perspectives, making it better than a newer option from that standpoint - It's far overpriced in my opinion, but cost is relative to a persons situation - Bottom line: I enjoyed it, but I was in the right mood, and believe I got it on sale a long time ago.  I'm happy with it personally.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I ended up playing this on a conventional monitor as it was designed and it was OK but not great. The pace of the game was really slow with a lot of walking around. The graphics might have been more impressive 5 or 10 years ago but it didn't look as great by today's standards.			",47,27,2,2,12,2,1

												Worst thing i have ever experienced (in terms of interactive media) in my life. This is in no way a game, it is however an enviroment with a story. A pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥story, with the worst field of view ever.  Never in my life have i gotten motion sickness from playing a game before. even raising the field of view to the max didn't help. I rage deleted this game once, then felt guilty and read online that it only takes an hour on average to finish, so was like what the hell lets just push through the nausia to see what it offers. and i did. And boy was it lame. This game has some pretty scenes, i'll give it that. Again though the soundtrack is so boring. The voice actor has the enthusiasm of a dead leaf that used to exist. Oh and if you think you have the option to turn off the boring♥♥♥♥♥music and listen to literally anything while you walk on this abysmal desolate island, guess what, no music sound slider, just a freakin master volume... The only way i managed to finish this game without stabbing myself is by singing freakin rap music lyrics by DMX, i say this why, well because i'm a metal head and don't like most rap. Why is this important, well its more important because it tells you something about me which is alot more than this game does. And don't get me wrong, i knew it was a walking sim. I knew. And just for another TMI moment i like walking around Skyrim going from one hold to the next without fast traveling just because, and i really did not like this one bit. I think everyone can find a lot more enjoyment in simply going outside your house/building aand staring at your wall as you walk arround it.Note - If you are visually impared, you can play this. However your experience will vary depending on the type of imparement you have. Specifically issues with blind spots, peripheral vision, and central vision. There are things to read and spot in this envirmonet as well though i am not really sure if they do anything to enhance the experience.			",265,65,5,28,12,1,28

I didn't care to listen to the fellow emote all the same drivel while I slowly walked thru again, so I just watched a video of the ending, which I'm appauled at for the fact that it glorifies suicide.

After just arriving on the desert island it's clear that something is going on unknown to the player.  The narration starts to craft a story around the setting as we drift from location to location pressed ever forward towards the unknown, a flashing red beacon the only hint of answers in the distance.Dear Esther is a narrative driven experience that unravels itself as the player follows the linear path from location to location.  The game's visuals can still be impressive despite its age and the narration stays strong throughout.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												While the environment is wonderfully designed at places, and the voice actor performed well ""Dear Esther"" is not a game, it is an experiment. Heralded as the genre creator of the ""Walking Simulator"" Dear Esther is remarkable for it's graphics and little else. My major disappointment was with the disjointed storytelling. While I understand that the ""every playthrough is unique"" and ""vague plot"" were actually design intended, I feel they were used ineffectively. I still don't know what was going on besides an initial car crash. Immediately after completing the game I had to websearch for the plot, which is almost never a good thing (Inception excluded). Besides, I don't know how Jacobsin the 18th century goatherd and Paul from Damascas fit into this story at all, but lord knows there is enough said about them. Certainly would not recommend at the current price point: $9.99.			",155,46,0,25,19,2,18

												Dear Esther's single most appreciable quality was to me a very personal one, being the first title I played on my new gaming PC, going back to my roots after years of near-exclusive console play. For this reason alone I deeply appreciated the smoothness of its detailed gloomy environments and overall hi-res graphical performance.However, in retrospect and especially after having enjoyed the far superior Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I wish there had been more variety or better memorable moments. Locations remain dark and monochromatic throughout, lifeless if not for the wind agitating the lush vegetation, with thematic variations for each chapter. The feeling of solitude is obviously intended but it makes the world feel lacking in authenticity or significance.I struggled for nearly a whole hour with the concept that there is absolutely nothing interactive in this title. Within two hours the journey was already over. Player agency is limited to wandering around wholly linearly as a nonetheless intriguing narrator tells a sad tale about a man, his wife, an island, a broken love story and probable death.Nothing to decipher or understand is required to progress, and therein lies its most glaring shortcoming. No real choice to make aside from occasionally going up or down a hill and ultimately arriving at the same destination. Your input is entirely limited to controlling the pacing in between bouts of finely delivered monologue. The only effort required is in the player's interpretation of the story, what it really means, what this whole journey was about.The writing, performance and story are all adequately interesting and pleasantly delivered to make this product feel like an augmented short story or poem, with competent audio and visual support. However, calling this experience a game would be highly inaccurate, which in itself is not necessarily bad though it did come to me as a severe disappointment. Intriguing concept and story, yes, even enjoyable to a certain extent, but unfortunately not very satisfying as a whole in the end. I'd rather read a good Neil Gaiman book to get a more fulfilling dose of mysterious melancholy.To say nothing of the music would be a disgrace as it must be the most notable part of the experience. Its soothing arrangements and simple melodies accompany the narrative beautifully. Absolutely brilliant work in context.Dear Esther has every right to exist as a viable product. It deserves an audience. It is even good for what it is. I just wish it had been better sold to me to properly mitigate my expectations. Its decent execution leaves me sufficiently curious to see what else developer The Chinese Room does next, hopefully improving on their art form in all necessary areas, but not enough to play it again or recommend the title as is.

												I really wanted this to be an amazing game before I started playing it. After I started, I wished it was an OK game. Essentially, Dear Esther is a game that is primarily meant to tell a story and does so by dispensing w/ gameplay nearly entirely. I do enjoy games that push boundaries of what games can be but this pushes it to the point where the gamer might as well not be involved at all.			",191,60,2,25,20,1,29

												This ""game"" does nothing to justify being one. This would have been better as a short film, even it was CGI or a machinima. Distinctly bad value, $10 for an hour of walking. The store page even says ""one of the most original first-person games of recent years"", because it's an original concept that $10 for an hour long walk was a feasible business practice. Save your dollarydoos and go for a walk while listening to an audio book, or something. The graphics will be better.			",158,23,1,9,3,0,6

												Ahh, why the heck did I bought this game having played the free HL2 Mod version which was a bit of a borefest? Simple really-GFX! The map layout and textures from the first made a HUGE FACELIFT with its amazing foliage and cold yet beautiful caves. Talking about caves, THIS GAME HAS THE PRETTIEST CAVES I'VE EVER SEEN IN A VIDEOGAME!!! Scan through my screenshots, though still kinda spoilerish, and you'll find spectacular views of the game except for the ending part.Errr, I guess it's wrong to call it a videogame since all you do is walk on this dreary Island and interact only with the ground below. Sometimes I wish, they'd make arelaxing, sunny and beautifully secluded /white sand /clear blue water- Beach map Paradise but that's the whole point really- A game that's desolately depressing with matching fantastic emo music and a cunning British accented narrator.Buy it with soundtrack and prepare to take countless screenshots on the cave part!

												The scenery was beautiful and the music was lovely. However, there wasn't enough going on visually to connect with the story. It was like going for a walk while listening to an audio book. The book might be good and it might be a beautiful day out but the two don't necessarily need to be enjoyed together. I ended up not knowing anything about the story by the end and I'm pretty sure I missed a good chunk of it because I took a wrong turn. It might have been a good story but I don't think that it needed to be told through a video game -- the interactivity of a game added nothing to the story because there were so few visual clues as to what was going on and it was literally being told to me through a big block of text over my screen.

												Yeah, It got a Beautiful Landscape. Like the movie director, the scenes are perfectly shoot. Like a painting.Yeah, it has a super narrator. Similar to The Stanley Parable. But at the same time it's too bad narrated. And it's not the narrator; it's the narrators text and his way of upperclass, british english texting.In the end the story is just don't touching at all. It's to meta. Well for me it is not. If someone is touched by it, that's great. But for me it doesn't work out. I just heard that it is a kind of remake of a mod, but i think it's no excuse. It has to many flaws.And the price of 20 Euros is so above all. I bought it at a deal for 4 Euros and i think that this is kind of fair.			",253,88,8,16,15,0,38

												Check your video settings before you start. Mine were set to lower-than-native resolution, with poor filtering, no anti-aliasing, and the lowest shader setting. Whether or not the game experience appeals to you, you'll certainly get more out of Dear Esther if it looks as nice as it can.The game experience didn't entirely appeal to me. I couldn't help feeling impatient with the slo-o-ow walking speed - although this became more tolerable later in the game as the narrator's dialogue clips became more frequent, and as there was more visual interest. I was frustrated by invisible walls that stopped me climbing gentle slopes, and I would have liked more ability to climb over rocks and such (at one point I wanted to climb onto a ship wrecked on the beach, and was disappointed to find I couldn't). It's not always clear where you can and can't go in the game - frustrating, given how long it takes to get anywhere. The constraints on my ability to move quickly around the map discouraged me from thoroughly exploring the environment - a pity, since I'm sure I missed a lot of dialogue hidden off the beaten track.The narrative was okay, but not mindblowing. Grief is a little humdrum (unless it's yours). The music was nicely ambient; the environment was very pretty indeed - but I didn't really get immersed in the game. My loss, maybe?

												Dear Esther is a 94-minute-long walking simulator that bases itself entirely around telling a story.This would be great if it weren't for the fact that the story is really uninteresting.There exist similar games that work really well (i.e. Gone Home, The Beginner's Guide) because their stories actually captivate the player.This is a dull game in which you walk at 0.125mph and listen to a man talk.Play something like Gone Home instead.

												I had this in my wishlist for a long time, after playing the amazing Ethan Carter i was in search for a similar experience, no fighting, no other player just me learning the sotry as i go. This game however is not that, it features an intriguing island setting and it potentially has a sotry worth looking into. It is not feasable however to have an island of large size, with many paths and options and not, not have a sprint button or a sped up walking pace. There are places i want to see but the time it takes walking to any location is extremely off putting.I'm looking for a nice slower paced game but not this slow moving, i'm afraid it's a refund only and those who are looking for an amazing story experience please look at Ethan Carter.

												It is great in what it wants to do. I loved the voiceacting, the writing and the soundtrack is amazing.Beside some nice optical impressions, the level design is very poor. There are no gameplay elements except walking. The ""game"" is very short. Thogh I appreciate the concept, the overall idea and very much embraced the atmostphere... it is overpriced, also regarding, that it is basically an HL-2 mod. All they did was create a rather empty island, put in some voiceacting (the writing might've taken 2 weeks, if they really put much effort into it) and added music. The graphics are not impressing and before I could really put my heart into the hands of the game, it was over, with a quite predictable ending aswell.I want to love it, but I can't. Do it again. Longer and harder.(I have waited for over 2 years for this to go into sale, and though I only payed half, I still thought about refunding it, bud didn't, hoping ""they"", would read and ackwnolidge this - I was also mad because the Soudtrack version did not go on sale, because that would've been worth my moeny.)

I ended up playing this on a conventional monitor as it was designed and it was OK but not great. The pace of the game was really slow with a lot of walking around.

												Worst thing i have ever experienced (in terms of interactive media) in my life. This is in no way a game, it is however an enviroment with a story. A pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥story, with the worst field of view ever.  Never in my life have i gotten motion sickness from playing a game before. even raising the field of view to the max didn't help. I rage deleted this game once, then felt guilty and read online that it only takes an hour on average to finish, so was like what the hell lets just push through the nausia to see what it offers. and i did. And boy was it lame. This game has some pretty scenes, i'll give it that. Again though the soundtrack is so boring. The voice actor has the enthusiasm of a dead leaf that used to exist. Oh and if you think you have the option to turn off the boring♥♥♥♥♥music and listen to literally anything while you walk on this abysmal desolate island, guess what, no music sound slider, just a freakin master volume... The only way i managed to finish this game without stabbing myself is by singing freakin rap music lyrics by DMX, i say this why, well because i'm a metal head and don't like most rap. Why is this important, well its more important because it tells you something about me which is alot more than this game does. And don't get me wrong, i knew it was a walking sim. I knew. And just for another TMI moment i like walking around Skyrim going from one hold to the next without fast traveling just because, and i really did not like this one bit. I think everyone can find a lot more enjoyment in simply going outside your house/building aand staring at your wall as you walk arround it.Note - If you are visually impared, you can play this. However your experience will vary depending on the type of imparement you have. Specifically issues with blind spots, peripheral vision, and central vision. There are things to read and spot in this envirmonet as well though i am not really sure if they do anything to enhance the experience.			",265,65,5,28,12,1,28

The scenery succeeds at being beautiful, and the tech is great, but It lost my save file and it doesn't let you skip anything. I didn't care to listen to the fellow emote all the same drivel while I slowly walked thru again, so I just watched a video of the ending, which I'm appauled at for the fact that it glorifies suicide. They throw reflections and shadows of ghosts in for good measure, to give people something to talk about, and that's the whole thing. That is the whole. thing.			",66,18,3,1,5,1,7

												I do love some good ole fashion narrative, artistic, story driven games.  Though this one falls a little bit short.  The aesthetics are stunning, its a beautiful georgous world for as dreary as it is intended to be.  But there's something that doesn't click w/ the rest of it.   Maybe a better narrator? Maybe the dialogue just seems a bit too much forced poetic art to allow me to enjoy the story.  Conclusion, if you catch it on sale, or have 45 mins of time to take in existential themed art, I'd recommend it.  But something is just slightly off delivery wise that prevents Dear Esther from being great.			",92,34,2,21,27,0,10

												I think that most of all, I agree with the ""most helpful"" negative reviews, which appear on the front page.  There's very little else that I can add to their points.  I think I could like this game, but the story needs more clarification, and the pacing needs to be sped up; a relaxing pace is fine, but a TEDIOUS pace, is anything but relaxing.  I kind of believe that they made the character walk as slow as he did, because of the lack of content.  As it stands, it's only a couple hours worth of gameplay.  I guess they anticipated people getting through it in less than an hour, but failed to take into account that most players would be more inclined to look at more aspects of the scenery, if it didn't make them ages to get there.  I MIGHT play it through again one day, tweaking walk speed in the console.  But the various drawbacks of the game left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I'm probably going to feel pretty reluctant about it for a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The positives: The game has great graphics and a very in depth naritive storyline. A very short story line average playthrough about 2 hours Great to show friends Really good voice acting Works fine with a remote (if you want to) The negatives: The game can only be played one or twice after that it gets boring quickly It is very expensive based on the content A top down review of the graphics does spoil the effectThe story line can be difficult to track and certain parts can be missed. If someone does not like a huge narrative stroyline then this is not the game for youTo conclude, this game is great and mind f*cking i recomend it highly although it is expensive and the graphics are a little let down.

												if you ever feel like walking through a hebredean island accompanied by a sad man who doesn't say anything plainly. but you can't find a man quite sad enough or getting him to a hebredean island for an hour's worth of strolling around is too much of a pain in the bum then have I got a game for you! in all seriousness it's a pretty good way to spend an hour, just don't go in expecting a ""game"" and you'll have fun, or you'll have something at least.

												Not for everyone but to all those who can appreciate pure ambiance and storytelling (with NO action whatsoever) this is a jewel. A gorgeous and surreal experience with a thousand little details for you to decipher if you so wish, and still quite interesting even if you don't run through it with a fine tooth comb. May be to artsy in gameplay and poetic in story for some (along with a short running time of about an hour and a half), but a full sensory blast for those in its target demographic and well worth the meager price.

												This isn't really a game, it's more like a visual story, where you're sort of along for the ride.   All you can really do is take your time travelling the paths on the island.    However the visuals are really beautiful.    You basically spend the time following paths while listening to the narrator of the story, but I found just looking at the scenery itself nice, due to the beauty of many of the areas you find yourself.

												...also known as ""Spelunking: The Game"". ""Dear Esther"" is what comes closest to an existential independent interactive film, a true sensorial and emotional cinematic experience, made up by breathtaking views and the most beautiful bittersweet soundtrack. Be aware though: in this Half-Life 2 mod there is nobody to shoot, and the limited moving option (no running, no jumping - only painfully slow walking) could put some people off. Also, it lasts only around one hour and half. This is not a game: this is interactive art cinema.			",55,31,0,5,1,0,10

												This is a story game. The story though is up to a lot of interpretation which may or may not be bad. I was a little disappointed at first since you can't interact with anything in the environment and no objective or goal is presented to you. However, it does have a progression, nice visuals and good narration. Although it looks like you can walk in any direction, this is not the case as the map constantly stops you (you can't jump or move things to progress either). This was a little frustrating. It became apparent I had to stay on a partially hidden path which gives the illusion of being able to walk anywhere. I modded the controls (mod from this discussion: https://steamcommunity.com/app/203810/discussions/0/864969481882137563/ ) in order to walk faster because there are some long branches in the path that forced me to backtrack and it was taking forever (because there was no run option). Overall it was OK. I really enjoyed the visuals (especially the caves they are amazing! :)). I wished it was a more concrete story and that it had either given me more freedom to explore or allowed me to interact with the environment. Game lasts about 2 hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very brave attempt at doing something a little different. I think it was wrong to villify the Chinese Room for what they did here. I mean, come on. Nobody buys this expecting a racing game or a puzzle game, do they? It is exactly what it is. A semi-interactive story which just happens to use the Source engine as a way of telling itself.It is worth playing through a couple of times, partly because the paths do branch in places, and also because the narration does change slightly. Certain text is removed, other is added, and as you replay you will discover a little more about the characters back story and grasp a little more of what actually happened.Maybe I'm a little biased because I have a growing fondness for Scottish islands, but I think it's refreshing to have something a little different than usual. Movies aren't interactive, but we don't condemn them for that. Why should something like this be held to the same standard as ""Gears of War"", which it clearly isn't trying to be. It's just a method of getting the story across, much as how ""House of Leaves"" played with the notion of a book. We don't write off audiobooks on the grounds that CDs are only for music, so why should a game engine only be used for it's original purpose?""Walking simulator""? Please. Is Call of Duty a ""gun simulator""? Actually, don't answer that.			",817,465,16,50,46,8,72

												This is a short story that takes about the same time to tell as a feature film. It's poetic and melancholic. Visually, it's like a tech demo - an example of what is possible with the game engine. It's an environment that you can explore and feel like you're there. It's a painting of a landscape that you can enter and walk through.Don't expect a game with challenges or things that need to be achieved. There are no puzzles here besides your own interpretation of the narrative. You probably already know if Dear Esther is something you would enjoy or not.			",58,19,0,12,2,3,5

												In the meanwhile this genre has gotten a name - ""walking simulator"". Which sounds a bit unfair and rude.On the other hand you could also call it a 3D-""adventure"", just without ""real"" puzzles nor cutscenes (except for the end) like similar games - the awesome ""Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" or the rough but very interesting ""Homesick"" for example.In my opinion it's a 1st person 3D-exploration-game with the ""goal"" to follow the narration clues that were left behind by human hand - to discover or at least guess the story behind this mystery-experience that will lead you across a beautiful, melancholically deserted island, underlined by a fitting wonderful soundtrack that will last in your ears and mind.However - be prepared for a rather sad story! I would not recommend this to depressed people. Yes, this game will merely make you walk SLOWLY (for a reason!) across a landscape to explore one scenery after another (including beautiful caves), will let you find stuff and signs left by.... someone ;) - and will make you listen to bits of the story, one after another, until you will reach the end - very literally. It made me cry.Oh, besides: luckily I did not stumble over any bugs :) This game has been published in 2012 after 2 years of development. So of course in the meanwhile it has gotten a bit outdated. The experience is still overwhelming, but after everything I have been playing ever since I would have wished for a small update-patch later on including at least a few small ""real"" Myst-like puzzles to solve on the way, a bit more unique details thrown into the sceneries - and the option to walk - or limp - at least a little bit faster. Also the story-bits are sometimes a bit too forcefully ""mysterious"" and a little off from the start instead of getting more and more confused concomitant to what the notes and narrations say, which I would have clearly prefered... I would not wish for ""enemies"" to fight though, nor NPCs to talk to on this abandoned place speckled with ruins and rusty remains of people who have long left the place. I also do not miss any stuff to collect nor an inventory at all for this kind of game.			",96,327,0,35,19,0,10

												I just spent 46 minutes playing this game, thinking it was a mere 15-20, and I am amazed.Never before, have I played a game that was so beautifully designed graphically nor story-wise. There is no interacting with anything in this, nor is there any point to doing anything. All you do is walk around, and yet I spent 46 minutes walking around a deserted island, and I'm not even done with the first part.Yesterday (February 16, 2014) I purchased this game - with others - via HumbleBundle, and I have never been so satisfied with the purchase of a game. It's so... I'm grasping for the right word... poetic.I loaded up this game not knowing what to expect, and have been thoroughly surprised by what I received. If I could hug the developers and simply sit in silence with them, I would do so.Before you buy this game, though, make sure you can understand a complex sentence... some things are said in a slightly cryptic manner, and you actually have to pay attention to what is being said, and how it is being said.

If you are ok with just walking around then give it a try.6,5/10			",286,100,6,60,33,1,81

												This is a story game. The story though is up to a lot of interpretation which may or may not be bad. I was a little disappointed at first since you can't interact with anything in the environment and no objective or goal is presented to you. However, it does have a progression, nice visuals and good narration. Although it looks like you can walk in any direction, this is not the case as the map constantly stops you (you can't jump or move things to progress either). This was a little frustrating. It became apparent I had to stay on a partially hidden path which gives the illusion of being able to walk anywhere. I modded the controls (mod from this discussion: https://steamcommunity.com/app/203810/discussions/0/864969481882137563/ ) in order to walk faster because there are some long branches in the path that forced me to backtrack and it was taking forever (because there was no run option). Overall it was OK. I really enjoyed the visuals (especially the caves they are amazing! :)). I wished it was a more concrete story and that it had either given me more freedom to explore or allowed me to interact with the environment. Game lasts about 2 hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a short story that takes about the same time to tell as a feature film. It's poetic and melancholic. Visually, it's like a tech demo - an example of what is possible with the game engine. It's an environment that you can explore and feel like you're there. It's a painting of a landscape that you can enter and walk through.Don't expect a game with challenges or things that need to be achieved. There are no puzzles here besides your own interpretation of the narrative. You probably already know if Dear Esther is something you would enjoy or not.			",58,19,0,12,2,3,5

												It's truly lovely, some say it's not a game but are you are in full control for the duration so i think it counts. It's just a pity it's over so quickly. An hour and a half and that's it; i was dawdling and admiring the view too.If there was more to actually do then it would be easier to recommend, but as it stands you start at point one, travel to point two listening to the intermittant narrative along the way. Without giving away anything, there are a few visual scrawlings to see along the way, but there's no other reward for straying from your path. The visuals are beautiful, the music enchanting and i enjoyed the experience while it lasted. But once you've been through it there is no reason to play it (ever) again. It is a thumbs-up, but not at full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an immersive poem. The randomized narration is reminiscent of David Lynch\'s Inland Empire; both present a mass of disjointed information to you and allow you to unconsciously connect the dots that have been blasted at you. It\'s a sort of sensory overload. And the haunting visuals and gorgeous audio all make for an incredibly atmospheric experience. It must be stated that this is specifically a walking simulator. Not a jumping simulator. Not a running simulator. Not a picking-up-breakable-mugs simulator. This is a walking simulator, and it\'s a damn good one.For anyone who likes Frost or Whitman, this game is worth the money. And the great graphics are not remotely demanding. My laptop lags when I drop a bomb in Garry\'s Mod on medium settings, yet I can run this game at max settings and not sense a remote dip in fps.There are a few things some players may miss. In the game one can see the silhouette of a person standing on the candlelit edge of a cliff. I assumed this was a statue, but upon reaching and later passing that location, I realized that whomever it was no longer was there.It\'s a wonderful, surreal little poem that presents itself as being full of choices and confusions, when really the path one follows is completely predestined (which is a theme the narrator understands, making the game just the right amount of self-aware). If you combine the visuals and controls of Drizzlepath with the narrative style of Serena, you have the wonderful Dear Esther, a game whose price is the same as my rating for it out of ten.

It's a movie or a short story trying to be a game, but I thought actually moving through the world (pushing forward on a controller for an hour) broke the immersion and made the story lose its impact.

												Getting this clear: This isn't exactly a game. It's more of a visual novel-esque type thing. This is a sort of game set in it's own category due to it's game play, and for sure this game play is NOT for everyone. Not every likes games that just have you explore your surroundings and listen to the story being told. But I'll tell you this is great in the respect of the story and exploration being told! That is what drives this game and it's what the folks over at the Chinese Room are wonderful at doing! So if you like games that involve more play and less story, then this just isn't for you.Now this game itself is about our unnamed player who came to the island to remember things that happend in his past. You get to learn about why he is at this island and about this ""dead Esther"" whom he speaks so much about. This game will draw you in from the vast island's sceanery and the brilliant dialogue. Soon enough this little ""game"" will draw you in to where you just want to know the whole story it's trying to give, even if it can be a bit uncomprehensible at a few moments, but you'll soon pick it back up into understanding.All in all, this is a very unique and interesting game and if you really want to play, but feel unsure about it, just wait until it goes on sale (That's what I did), and I'm sure you'll either be satisfied with it or not mad that you spent too much on it.

There is no interacting with anything in this, nor is there any point to doing anything. All you do is walk around, and yet I spent 46 minutes walking around a deserted island, and I'm not even done with the first part.Yesterday (February 16, 2014) I purchased this game - with others - via HumbleBundle, and I have never been so satisfied with the purchase of a game.

												Probably one of my worst gaming experiences. It feels terrible, you move really slow, I'm not against walking simulators but this is more of a crawling simulator. I've read that people enjoy the story-telling in this title, I don't think I've heard one. I guess some could say that the ambiguity and general fuzziness of the story is great and artsy and all, like it's something to make you think, but really how I heard it, it was simply stupid sentences laid one after the other in order to make the whole experience seem spiritual. Kinda felt like torture at some point, maybe it was intended (it's art after all, right? heh), in which case good job.			",215,39,11,31,32,1,24

												Dear Esther was my very first Steam 'game', and I think it's time to give it a review.First of all, this isn't a game, it's 100% a walking simulator. Some people see that as a bad thing, but this just shouldn't be a game, being a walking simulator fits the best. The narrator has a perfect voice for this experience. As you walk on the island, the narrator tells you a vague story with sometimes long pauses. You really have to pay attention to the narrator to understand the story at the end, he will make you question a lot. Who's the narrator? Who am I? What is our relation? Just try to discover it for yourself during your walk on the beautiful, haunting island. The atmosphere is breathtaking, it's cold, grey, haunting and just beautiful. Just like the visuals and the landscapes. And I almost forgot it, but it's very important: The music, it's beautiful and fits so well! I still listen quite a lot to it because it's so beautiful.If you like a walkingsimulator with a great story and great atmosphere, then this is a must-have! And even if you're not a big fan of walking simulators but you do enjoy a good story and it's on sale, I recommend it for you. If Dear Ester is your taste, you'll get suck into it and you will really think about it.Perhaps it's just because this was my first game ever, but I'll always love and appreciate this experience a lot!

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Dear Esther

After just arriving on the desert island it's clear that something is going on unknown to the player.  The narration starts to craft a story around the setting as we drift from location to location pressed ever forward towards the unknown, a flashing red beacon the only hint of answers in the distance.Dear Esther is a narrative driven experience that unravels itself as the player follows the linear path from location to location.  The game's visuals can still be impressive despite its age and the narration stays strong throughout.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												I already completed this game, but why do I have more than an hour? Well for starters this game isn't just something you delete and forget about it. If you are depressed, frustrated, or sad this game helps. The graphics and story just come together beautifully. Some parts still get me, but overall it's a dramatic journey through a person who is trying to hold on to hope and memories.			",63,14,0,13,10,0,22

												A beautifully crafted world and a captivating story that is guaranteed to make you think. One of those amazing experiences where the world itself acts as a narrator, and you're rewarded for all the attention you pay to your surroundings. One of my favourite gaming experiences of all time.			",124,76,1,17,12,1,21

												Like any ""walking simulator"", Dear Esther isn't for everyone. Personally, I would reccomend getting this game while it's on sale, unless you really REALLY love story driven walks. That being said, Dear Esther is a gorgeous experience, telling an engrossing story with grandiose visuals without ever leaving the trappings of a smaller, more intimate tale. Sure, it's short, clocking in at a little over an hour, but you can take your time and just mosey through the wilderness, losing yourself in the surroundings in between every little morsel of plot. That's where the real meat of the game is.			",120,22,0,8,2,0,0

												I am a big fan of the ""walking simulator"" type of game so please keep that in mind when you read this.Dear Esther is a short, but powerful experience. The game looks great, has a good story, and has good sound. The game is a great break from the endless cycle of action games.			",225,46,2,20,11,0,24

												So I wrote a snarky refview initially and thought better of it.  This is obviously something a lot of people enjoyed, but I could not wait for the end.  It's a movie or a short story trying to be a game, but I thought actually moving through the world (pushing forward on a controller for an hour) broke the immersion and made the story lose its impact.

												I'm truly appalled that this product is being advertised as a game. There is no element of involvement in this game, other than walking in a straight line. The people who made this ""game"" should be ashamed of themselves. In my opinion it is merely a vehicle to promoe whoever wrote that gibberish coming out of my speakers.However, the environment is sublime. It truly is stunning the time and effort the designers put into this product. You actually feel you are walking within this bleak and barren landscape. There are so many touches to the graphics that make you look twice, or your head turns to see each blade of long-grass moving independently.I just feel sorry for those guys, because their skill has been associated with such a crass and meaningless product. If Bethesda could get hold of these guys their environment quality would be 10 times more incredible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther: Oh dear, my day was wonderful mix of fright, suspence and exploring ""the island"" in question.And its here the question about this experience comes in; was it good enough to pay for?Its all comes down to about how much time you spend with this. This is a experience in a la 1993is noncombat maze style -Phillips CDI/Amiga CD32 tradition.If you like/love the era mentioned above, stop read; just buy what evar the pricetag says as long its under 10Euro.If you dont know the era mentioned above do not buy this game unless its under the pricetag of 2-3Euro and then take it as a walk along a beach an afternoon and start enjoy it from that angle and just go along with it for the expirience; I am only not recommending this game out of 1 single fact: its way;way to short for my taste;I still remember pretty much this entire game after more then 2 years I played it.In a good way.

												Cannot believe this game is only in the 70 percentle. Epic, epic experience. Sadly I think people came in expecting something else and that has tarnished this game's place in history.Basically, the game is just one long screen shot. In the best way possible. Let me explain...This is the epitome of a walking sim people. But in a good way. This is not a game to play when you want to scratch that action/strategy/puzzle solving gaming itch. This is a game to play when your mind is racing from a stressful day, you can't seem to relax, and you just want to shut down for a bit but still be alive...you can either go get a professional massage or play Dear Esther (and this is coming from a massage therapist).I'll start with the soundtrack, which is nothing short of incredible. I could absolutely listen to it all day, and honestly it would be great to play as background music for my work (again, in a good way). Then you have the writing, which is superbly superb. Some of the metaphors used are just...brilliant. Pulitzer winning stuff, honestly. It's a bit over the top at times, but then again, so is Dickens and Shakespeare (big time).  Graphics are...perspective based. If you zoom in on a little leaf on a small vine, it does look flat and pixelated (and I'm fully maxed on graphics). Water is translucent and wishy washy, occasional pop ins but not too bad.. But again, this is not a game to compare to other games. It is not about that. It's like comparing Myst to Call of Duty. It is literally an experience. If you're able to look past the minor details and at the entire picture, the game looks stunning. Anywhere you look, literally, is a picture perfect screen shot. What you see in the images above can literally be taken anywhere. This is what I mean by one long screenshot. It really doesn't matter where you're looking, wherever the mouse ends up, you'll be left with this beautiful and serene island, lost within itself as an eerie expedition into what happens when a dying human conscious becomes lost to mother earth.The story is....well, it isn't really a story driven game, imo. Even though the description and some reviews say so. Again the snippets of writing here and there are beautiful, but it is very fragmented, mostly scattered anecdotes that are triggered and vaguely correlate to what you might be looking at. I do believe it's intentional, so again it's a matter of perspective. Basically it's more of telling you a story of what happened, instead of the story that's happening now. I personally see this game as a stress reliever, so I'd be ok if there was literally no story at all, it's simply that kind of game, but what is given is intriguing enough to keep you interested.But, that pretty much sums it up. Isn't it great? No faulty mechanics, no annoying enemies, no expectations for a story, no camera issues...just pure nothing in the most beautiful way possible. I don't think this game has anything in it other games should emulate (other than good writing and sound design). It has no ground breaking mechanics or visuals. Yet, it is completely unique and if there is a follow up I hope they don't change a thing.Highly recommended....IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!!! AGAIN, IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!!!9/10 would stare at cave entrance for 10 minutes againPS For those who DID think this was something else, I think you might be more interested in The Solus Project. Very lonesome and surreal, no enemies, but there is a survival aspect involved as well as some light puzzle solving. Also a great game, but it requires you to stay on your toes. Dear Esther simply asks you keep your eyes open, and IF THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, it does not get much better..			",181,22,0,29,14,0,21

												A very brave attempt at doing something a little different. I think it was wrong to villify the Chinese Room for what they did here. I mean, come on. Nobody buys this expecting a racing game or a puzzle game, do they? It is exactly what it is. A semi-interactive story which just happens to use the Source engine as a way of telling itself.It is worth playing through a couple of times, partly because the paths do branch in places, and also because the narration does change slightly. Certain text is removed, other is added, and as you replay you will discover a little more about the characters back story and grasp a little more of what actually happened.Maybe I'm a little biased because I have a growing fondness for Scottish islands, but I think it's refreshing to have something a little different than usual. Movies aren't interactive, but we don't condemn them for that. Why should something like this be held to the same standard as ""Gears of War"", which it clearly isn't trying to be. It's just a method of getting the story across, much as how ""House of Leaves"" played with the notion of a book. We don't write off audiobooks on the grounds that CDs are only for music, so why should a game engine only be used for it's original purpose?""Walking simulator""? Please. Is Call of Duty a ""gun simulator""? Actually, don't answer that.			",817,465,16,50,46,8,72

												Dear esther is a nice little artistic game. It wasn't what I was expecting and I'm sad that it was so short.There aren't any puzzles to solve (well directly) and it's really an experince. I could see someone being annoyed at the end when the controls are taken over from you but that's part of the experince too.Shares more in common with stanley parable then any other steam game out there. I kinda wish the audio logs matched what you were looking at just a bit more. In the first part, it would have been nice to hear about finding the ships log and the antacid yohgurt when you were looking at the paint cans.Part of me wishes it were more of a puzzle game instead of an art experince and the other part of me wishes none of that. Just keep it an art experince and make it longer next time!Would I recommend this? If your looking for an un-game art experince? yes. This is definitly one of those.If your looking for a puzzle/adventure, try something else like anti-chamber instead.			",76,17,1,6,5,1,10

												Before you buy this game, you NEED to understand what it is.  The entire game is just walking slowly and very indirectly towards a blinking light on the horizon.  There are no enemies or puzzles.  That is not going to be everyone's idea of fantastic game design.  If that sounds terrible to you, well.  Then you don't want this game.  That's totally fine.However, the game does tell a story, and a very good one.  As you explore and make your way forward, you will be fed small observations and recollections which you must piece together yourself.  The story is just ambiguous enough to be fascinating.  It's not inscrutible.  You'll probably have a fairly good grasp of the story by the end if you were listening attentively.  And if you don't, a second loop should help you feel more certain.  (And replaying the game is plot-appropriate in a delightfully subtle way.)The game is also beautiful.  If you happen to have a 3D monitor, you are in for a TREAT.  I really can't stress that point enough.  I left it as the last thought in this review only because I know most readers don't want to hear about that.  This game is almost justification enough for buying a pair of active shutter glasses, though.  Stunning if played that way.			",54,394,0,13,18,0,13

												In the meanwhile this genre has gotten a name - ""walking simulator"". Which sounds a bit unfair and rude.On the other hand you could also call it a 3D-""adventure"", just without ""real"" puzzles nor cutscenes (except for the end) like similar games - the awesome ""Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" or the rough but very interesting ""Homesick"" for example.In my opinion it's a 1st person 3D-exploration-game with the ""goal"" to follow the narration clues that were left behind by human hand - to discover or at least guess the story behind this mystery-experience that will lead you across a beautiful, melancholically deserted island, underlined by a fitting wonderful soundtrack that will last in your ears and mind.However - be prepared for a rather sad story! I would not recommend this to depressed people. Yes, this game will merely make you walk SLOWLY (for a reason!) across a landscape to explore one scenery after another (including beautiful caves), will let you find stuff and signs left by.... someone ;) - and will make you listen to bits of the story, one after another, until you will reach the end - very literally. It made me cry.Oh, besides: luckily I did not stumble over any bugs :) This game has been published in 2012 after 2 years of development. So of course in the meanwhile it has gotten a bit outdated. The experience is still overwhelming, but after everything I have been playing ever since I would have wished for a small update-patch later on including at least a few small ""real"" Myst-like puzzles to solve on the way, a bit more unique details thrown into the sceneries - and the option to walk - or limp - at least a little bit faster. Also the story-bits are sometimes a bit too forcefully ""mysterious"" and a little off from the start instead of getting more and more confused concomitant to what the notes and narrations say, which I would have clearly prefered... I would not wish for ""enemies"" to fight though, nor NPCs to talk to on this abandoned place speckled with ruins and rusty remains of people who have long left the place. I also do not miss any stuff to collect nor an inventory at all for this kind of game.			",96,327,0,35,19,0,10

												Pros:+ Intriguing story, it can be regarded on multiple levels of the literal-metaphoric spectrum, very thought-provoking+ Beautiful sceneries (especially after entering the cave)+ Very atmospheric music & sounds+ Interesting map design solutions, it plays with the player's direction of viewCons:- The story is honestly confusing af. It's trying so hard to be poetic, that it often comes through as pretentious. The lack of information and the unreliable narrator doesn't help. Though the end result is thought-provoking, so whatever floats your boat :)- Slllloooow walking speed. Fortunately there are ways to fix it, look in the Guides and/or PCGamingWiki. (Unfortunately I only realised it after I played through the game D: )- The ghost sighting are very easy to miss, the only one I found by myself was the obvious one standing on top of the rock after exiting the cave. According to guides/youtube videos, there are tons more I've never noticed O.o- In multiple points of the map the narration segments triggered are selected randomly from a few possibilities, meaning you never hear the whole story just from one playthrough, which seems kind of a bummer. The game isn't so interesting to play it through multiple times just to hear a few more bits of the story, when they are all up on the game's wiki anyways.- Confusing saving system, I accidentally restarted my game around third-way through because of this.

												I could (and have done numerous times in the past) rant for hours about this game. The most pretentious attempt at a story driven indie game 'experience' I've ever seen.In fact I'm pretty sure they just took a 14 year olds B+ graded English poetry essay and had it read aloud to you very slowly as you're forced to walk around in a dismal, repetitive island made in the Source engine.I understand how for some people who like to do everything they can to find meaningful messages in absolutely everything even when there aren't any, this game must be a joy but I just can't say I feel the same way.

												The first thing about this game, is that it isn't a game.  It is a visual novel which unfolds a poetic narrative at certain trigger points you cross as you walk along a fairly strictly linear pathway across an island, through caves and other sights to see along the way.  The artwork in the game is rather nice, which is the only thing I really appreciated about the title.You basically walk around until you figure out where the single exit is from where you are to whatever is next, and you keep doing this while possibly enjoying the visual artwork, but you can't really interact with anything of substance and you just walk along listening to depressing poetry.  The entire title can be completed effortlessly in 90 minutes since all you basically do is walk along, then walk some more and listen to the poetic story being told.  If it were in virtual reality it might have been a more enjoyable experience amping up the art factor another notch, but it's pretty dull overall if one was expecting an actual video game of some sort as it is not a game.I was disappointed overall and wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless one greatly appreciates visual art and poetry and isn't expecting to be able to play an actual game where you interact with anything.  The entire experience could just as easily been turned into a 60-75 minute long movie to watch more as an art exhibit.  That being said, those who are into art and poetry may very well enjoy this so long as they weren't expecting an actual game. ",259,53,18,24,28,3,50

												Dear Esther,Please don't buy this game.  It's awful, and just when you think it's about to begin, you discover you're actually at the end.  Buy a decent book instead.Thinking of you always.Lots of love,Scanner			",110,46,5,80,45,1,75

												I can't think of the words to come up with a proper review for a game like this. I mean, words by themselves would just be a subjective representation of something that should be experienced. Like a fleeting memory of a long lost loved one, or the recurring pain you feel on a winter night, about the past you want to correct, and a future of mistakes. It's reality in your face, in a world that lives in imaginary wonderlands and facades. If humans just took one moment to see what's in front of them, and truly cherish what is most important, the world wouldn't be like it is today.It's not about Dear Esther changing the landscape of gaming, it's not the somber narrative, or the mixed messages you as the player try to interpenetrate. It's more than that, it's everything you want it to be, and nothing. It can be a silly game with no point, or it can be an important piece of literature. To me, it's what I've seen and been through, it's loss, it's regret, it's sorrow and happiness, and most importantly it's freedom. So yes, Dear Esther is an important piece of work, and it just so happens to come in an interactive format.  Laugh if you must, and mock if you will, but game companies can learn from Dear Esther. It's just too bad, that the masses like shooty shooty bang bang, and sparky sparks go flashy flash.			",348,78,13,37,12,3,12

												This is a tough game for me to recommmend, would love it there was a 'Neutral' button on Steam. It's beautiful and the music is amazing, but the game feels shallow. The ending is nice, but it comes after slowly walking for 90+ minutes.The last chapter feels most enjoyable, I'm not sure who would want to play through the first two though to get to that point honestly.Suggestions for improvement- Keep the user engaged more consistently through the narrartion. More talking, even if it's minor thoughts.- Interactions. Something to feel like you're actually engaged in the world- Make it more linear, if the point is pushing the story forward and the are no 'Easter Eggs' or 'rewards' for exploring make it so someone can't 'Get Lost'- Subtitles - Could be more interesting, could be used as typograhic art that scrolls or changes in size and font to fit the mood. They felt drab and did little for immersion, so I turned them off- Abilty to walk faster...jog even. Less of an issue if it was more linear, but going 'The wrong Way' then back tracking is tiresome here - Camera: Make more dynamic, small bobbing as the character walks			",315,69,7,8,7,7,15

												If I'm not mistaken, this game used to be a free mod for Half Life 2. And I think $10 is kinda too much.However, let's put that away and focus on the game.A game. Extraordinary. I didn't expect this game to be that extraordinary. None of a game had gave me this experience before. A very heart-warming and wonderful visual and sound experience. Its too unusual to be called 10/10 but the art and fresh idea deserve a 10/10. So...10/10 (except for the price :P)			",348,90,6,27,18,3,33

												Short answer:What is this game?   It's like going to an art museum; you walk around and look and listen.  In this game, you are here to observe and nothing else.  Honestly I feel like I could just have watched a let's play on it and gotten essentially the same experience.  It's not unique to me or my playthrough.My meandering impression of the game:I finally got to play it months after all the hype has passed.  I went into it knowing what Dear Esther was about, which perhaps ruins some of the experience.What kind of experience was it?   Perhaps similar to Gone Home, except I really went into that not knowing what it was about and I got to interact a lot more with the environment.Yes, interaction...something that I didn't really get from the game.  It just wanted me to sit, watch, and listen, and I'm okay with that because I knew that this is what it was about...but really I wish they had an auto run button since all I did was hold down the W key as I moved forward.I understand what they were trying to do, but the whole point of the medium is to have the player interact with the environment.  What is created here is a very unique art museum.  Sure, you can download it to your computer, play from the comfort of your home, but ultimately all you're doing is walking around looking at the exhibits and hope that you will find something profound that strikes a cord within you.  I didn't get that from this, sadly.			",138,41,2,31,22,4,32

												I don't recommond, nor do I not recommend this game.It's too tricky to do so. For the sake of being able to post this at all, I'll select 'recommend'.First and foremost: this is not a game.It's literally just walking around with no purpose other than walking and following a path. There is a story.. Now the part that people who love this game will hate me for.. The story wasn't really great. I love stories in games, it's why I bought this game in the first place, but this story just seemed to be pretty irrelevant, and try hard and end up being bland.Now, if I feel like this, why do I not simply not recommend it?The scenery is goreous, really really beautiful. Not only that, but the soundwork, both the music and sound effects, are really good too. I personally love islands, and the sea, and seeing weathered stuff. If you're into that sort of thing, like I, then this game might be (just barely) worth the money. Maybe you even make more sense of the story than I did.All in all, my opinion on this is sorta split.

												See the tag ""Walking Simulator"" on the game page?  Yeah, that's not a joke.  Literally the only game play is movement via the WASD keys.  If that's all the gameplay Dear Esther has to offer, then it barely classifies as a game.  You could literally watch a let's play on youtube and get the same experience.   If you happen to find it on a Steam sale for less than a dollar and you have some change sitting in your steam wallet from selling cards, go ahead and buy it.  It looks nice and has a good atmostphere, but it's not worth more than that.  Otherwise, don't bother paying more than that and for the love of god don't pay the full $9.99 for this.

												i want some of whatever the positive reviewers are smoking. You can't just shout the word art to deflect criticism, espically when things are thrown into this game with no meaning or bearing on the plot. And to top it all off, 10$ for half an hour of game, maybe more, some dialog changes a second time, you might notice somthing you didn't the first time but that is it. 10$ for a half life 2 mod, but with pretter graphics. waste your money on something else, go wait for gone home to go on sale if you really need one of these walking ""games"". in the argument of are games art, this should never be used as an example, Silent hill 2, shadow of the collossus, Deus Ex, Half Life 2, Portal, Spec Ops: The Line, Papers Please, Not only are they actually games that require an input from a player, they are leaps and bounds more artistic then thechineseroom could ever dream to be(notice how so of those arn't that deep but at least they have a cohesive narative)			",245,47,3,18,39,2,12

												What can I say about this game? Well a lot actually. when you start the game you think hmmm this seems like it my be some kind of horror game. Better watch my back. As you SLOWLY progress through the game you realize its not. now when I say slowly if you couldn't tell I meant it in the whole sense of the word. Your character walks like like a sloth through tar and you cant run or pick up stuff or solve puzzles because the only controls are WASD and the mouse to look around. Thats it there are no other controls to the game. So If you thought that this might be some kind of mist tribute like some people I know you are sadly mistaken and I am so glad that I could stop them from buying this game just like I'm trying to convince you to do. But I digress. So back to the actuall game. It runs off of the valve source engine so you can expect what kind of graphics to see in the game only they are about 2X worse some how. The game is very slow, very boring, and very pointless. It shouldn't even be considered a game for crying out loud. And are you ready for the real kicker *******************SPOILER ALERT*******************SPOILER ALERT******************SPOILER ALERT************************** IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE PLANNING ON BUYING THIS POOR EXCUSE TO MAKE MONEY THEN DO NO READ ANY FURTHER THEN THIS POINT BECAUSE I AM ABOUT TO SPOILE THE WORST ENDING TO THE WORST PLOT EVER! SO PLEASE IF YOU WISH TO SAVE SOME MONEY DONT EVEN BOTHER USING THE COUPON ON THIS GAME ITS STILL NOT WORTH IT***************** SPOILER ALERT************** SPOILER ALERT*************************SPOILER ALERT******************Okay so if you've come this far aperently you want to save some money. So here we go. The plot is your character wakes up on an island. No real indication on who you are why you are there or why you should give a f****. As you slowly walk through the game the narrator starts talking about a woman named Ester. Also he talks some other random crap I was to bored to care about. So as you walk through the game you reach this raido tower where he talks about Ester some more and how he hurt her. Then..... are you ready for this? He jumps off and Kills him self. Then its game over. there is no new game plus there is nothing interesting that happens after the credits... its just over. You killed your self. Thats it. In short what do I think of this game. Its crap in its purest form. If you took a machine that could convert crap into computer data that data would come out to be this game. Is boring, unintersting and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (and no I will not apologize for using the R word because this is America and I'm intitled to say what ever I want.) DO NOT! I REPEAT! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS IN NO WAY EVER GOING TO BE WORTH THE TIME OR MONEYI'm just so glad I got it in a humble bundle so I only spent about $2 on this and like 4 other games because if I had spent the whole $9.99 they are asking for I probably would have driven down to the studio my self and demanded the money back from the person in charge of making this game him/her self. This game gets a 0/10 from me.			",215,15,0,25,15,2,9

There were moments on the journey that I was lost in this other world. When I looked up from my computer I was back in my crummy apartment. It wasn't until the final chapter that I really had a problem. I fell into the water and my game froze, though the sound kept going. Normally you would just be brought back but I never was. I exited to the menu to start from the final chapter and it wouldn't let me. In fact, it would only select the first chapter. Really? I spent all that time and I can't even finish it!? So wonderful experience but that fatal flaw just didn't make it worthwhile in the end.			",96,70,3,45,14,4,26

												I'm not sure what I think of this walking simulator game, nor its genre. The word game implies fun to me, or at least a challenge. This offers neither of those. You press forward, sometimes side to side, and you ""progress"" through a narrated story. You can sorta die by falling off high ledges and wandering into the ocean, but it is a inconsequential death. There's no way to save your progress, except you can select from a chapters list to pick some parts of the game. In that way, it's more like a DVD except you have to hold down a button to play it and you can look around 360 degrees. If you're someone who is interested in purchasing and using this product, I'm sure my recommendation is as inconsequential as walking into Dear Esther's ocean. However, having now owned this product for a long period of time now and given my repeated efforts of trying to play it, attempting to enjoy it, yet always failing to feel good about opening it or even seeing it in my library, I simply cannot recommend Dear Esther.

												Dear Esther is attempted poetry in video game form, but falls flat in most regards.----These are the things you can expect when thinking about purchasing this game.The good;  A beautiful classical soundtrack (though somewhat poorly implemented perhaps)  Some pretty cavesThe bad;  Lots of excruciatingly slow walking  A mostly uninteresting environment with lots of no reward dead ends  Some dialogue, most of which makes no sense  An obvious story  You cannot interact with anything or do anything other than walk excruciatingly slowly (you can't even jump)----I'm actually quite a fan of narrative driven games and have enjoyed other ""walking simulator"" games in the past. Unfortunately this one is neither fun to play nor particularly rewarding. It does have some good moments - the ending makes for a nice visual and a few of the dialogue entries do have merit. I particularly enjoyed the caves which filled me with a feeling of tranquil beauty. But as a whole the bad far outweighs the good and it mostly just put me to sleep.Overall, Dear Esther as a video game is terrible. Dear Esther as a visual and auditory poetry experience is passable, if somewhat pretentious and particularly boring in the early parts. ",253,51,6,26,15,2,38

												I tried to like this game, I really did. But... in the end... it is a poor excuse for a video game and it ends up just a pretentious, shallow, boring walking simulator. I mean this game is nothing. Most video games in general give you a story, characters, world, and gameplay, but Dear Esther thinks ""wouldn't it be a revolutionary idea to remove all the story, characters, interactive world and gameplay from our videogames?"". And if you argue that it is a ""piece of art"" as if it is therefore above criticism as a video game my response is ""So? That is no excuse, all video games are a form of art, and there are tons of games that are far more artistic and better presented such as Life Is Strange."" In the end, unless you have literally never played video games before, don't bother with this one. If you have an urge to play this game, or already have played it and still have that itch you want scrathed (and even if you enjoyed it and think you got that itch scratched), go play Life Is Strange and get your fix of what this game is pretending to be.

												A boring walking simulator. If you actually try to go ANYWHERE off the main path, the narrator starts repeatedly saying ""go back"" every 2 seconds, so theres nothing off of the beaten path, so you just end up playing through the same exact experience if you've beaten the game and gone back.the only thing to actually look for are the ""ghosts"" the you occasionally see. The ""gameplay"" is literally just holding W and turning the mouse, the game doesn't even trust you to turn on the flashlight. The story is nice, but half the time the narration is useless drivel that was added in just to sound deep and philisophical, when really it feels more like a 13 year old desperately trying to be a good writer. The graphics look nice, but theres nothing memorable at all from any of the locations, JUst broing abandoned building on a desolate island. If you REALLY want to give this game a try go try out the FREE half life 2 mod that is essentially the same experience.			",100,18,3,8,16,0,3

												This isn't a full fledged game review as I haven't finished it yet (and I'm not sure if I ever will), but after completing Anna Extended Edition, I guess I was expecting a bit more from Dear Esther. It looked the same on the outside, but while Anna provided tricky puzzles, chilling atmosphere, amazing graphics and intriguing story, Dear Esther doesn't have anything of that. It's literally a walking simulator with some narrated stuff that doesn't seem to have much in relation to the scenery itself. Granted, the scenery is amazing, calling it just breathtaking would be an understatement, especially since it's running on somewhat dated Source Engine. But paying 9,99€ for a ""game"" with pretty scenery where all (and only thing) you can do is walk around stupendously slowly is simply not worth it. I got it through a cheap deal so it's not that big of a deal, but as it is, it's too expensive. If I'd wanted a non interactive game, I'd watch a movie or read a book...If it had interactivity with objects, reading story by picking up notes and books, puzzles, in a way Anna was made, then I'd be playing it with highest interest. But the way it is presented, it's not even nearly engaging enough to pull me into the game. Sorry, I can't recommend it. You need a very specific taste to enjoy this game and I don't think many people have that kind of taste. And this is coming from someone who loves adventure and/or exploration games.

In this game, you walk and you try to understand the story that the voice tells you.

												Is it really worth the $10 (or euros which is what I payed) for 1.5 hours of gameplay? Don't think so. You can't interact with your environment, just walk around and notice things that by the end I found it all to be just sentimental mumbo jumbo. The graphics are cool sure, but in what game nowadays arent?!I do not recommend this game at all and I honestly feel scammed by sites that suggested this as one of the best games of the year.

												The game was visually stunning. I found myself actually taking a couple of screenshots because of how pretty the landscape was. The story was alright, nothing I would really present as anything more than above average though. The voice acting was good... and that's really about it.I would comment on how the gameplay was, but there really isn't any gameplay at all. You can only walk and kinda zoom in a little bit. There is no jumping, no sprinting, nothing. You just walk, zoom in on the pretty landscapes, and listen to this dull sounding guy drone on about Esther.The story had me interested in the beginning, and near the end again, the middle I find myself overwhelmed by boredom though. I could never see myself playing through this again, other than to maybe show someone how pretty the landscapes are and that's about it.Basically what we have here is still technically a game, but I don't think it needed to be. There is no gameplay after all, nothing to do. It would have been better served as a short story in my opinion.			",140,26,0,21,25,1,25

												To put it bluntly: this is not a game. I repeat this is not a game. It is something between a Tech Demo and a Short Film. There's no interaction, no cast, no nothing. There's just the (beautifully rendered) landscape and a drawn out purposfully confusing monologue. All very dramatic and melanchonic. Actually too dramatic and too melanchonic, it's as if the authors are desperately trying to rub your face in a big pile of doom&gloom while shouting ""Be sad! Be sad ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it!"". It's perfect for emo teenagers or for people looking for a depressing monologue. Just don't pay more than 5 bucks for it.			",44,30,2,12,5,1,23

The entire gameplay of Dear Esther consists of walking, which is tremendously unrealistic due to bizzare sliding and a lack of fall damage if you decide to walk off a cliff, and rotating the camera via the complicated action of moving the mouse.Congratulations, you've mastered all of the gameplay in this 'game'.I didn't finish it, because it's very boring. The writing is pretentious, but all it really does is apply basic philosophy/rare terms and apply them to basic things. The only thing the game really has going for it are decent visuals.

												I enjoy interactive narratives like Thirty Flights of Loving, Dys4ia, Passage, Stanley Parable, (I'll even defend the much hated Dinner Date) but I really, really did not enjoy Dear Esther.The main problem I have with it is that I don't feel like my interaction is vital or adds anything to the offered experience. Yes, I can walk around and enjoy the level design on my own terms but how is this reflexive of any sort of narrative theme. Yes, narrative elements are implemented into the environment, and vice-versa, but if this game were on rails with the player only controlling the direction the camera was facing and the speed of progression would the experience really be that different?If I don't feel like my interaction is important, that it is necessary for me to be a participant, then I might as well be a bystander and observer, in which case this is not the proper medium for the piece.

The protagonist of Dear Esther is too morose to climb out of such a fiendish obstacle.It's got beautiful visuals and incredible music, and if the writing were worth a damn I'd probably suck it up and play through that hour again but ultimately I think the writing in this is kind of terrible and nonsensical. It's so ridiculously obsessed with being mysterious and grim that even really basic details about the who, what and when of the story are completely obscured. Goes for evocative, mostly comes back inane. So maybe I was only 10 minutes away from the twist ending where it's revealed he invented the atomic bomb or is a ghost or whatever, but I don't care enough to find out.			",119,57,1,11,7,3,22

												It basically tells a story. However, it does this very, very slowly. I realise the intention is for it to be atmospheric but the questionable graphics and long periods of time of very slowly walking along a grim cliff-side make it hard to continue playing it. Despite this, it may just be me having a shorter attention span than those it is aimed at. All-the-same, I would not recommend playing it.

												As much as people hype up this game, I can't reccommend it. It has some interesting aspects and interesting points to think about, but is it a good 'game'? Eh.TLDR is at the bottome \/Dear Esther is a game where you walk around and explore. . . sorta. As you walk around, little tid bits of who you are (or might be/just a narrator) pop up and give you a vague idea of the story in the form of letters. Well, read aloud letters. It's pretty neat how the story bits can tie in with what you are spectating. However, exploring can get pretty tedious. If you don't walk into a certain area you don't get the dialogue, or if you back track you don't get anything. Since you can't run, there can be long pauses where it's just you walking around trying to figure out where you should go. There are paths that lead you to and fro with a few other paths leading to new bits of dialogue, but attempting to explore much can lead to lots of boring backtracking through large areas. Going as linear as you can is probably more enjoyable.As far as environments go, Dear Esther has some gorgeous locations. The whole 'game' takes place on a small uninhabitated island, so you're gonna get a lot of ocean and some pretty cool caves to. . . well, walk through. I was particularly impressed with the caves and are by far my favorite part of the game.And the narrative. If you haven't heard anything about Dear Esther, be warned - It can get confusing. Each run can give you slightly different audio tidbits. Last time I checked, some of them lead to very different assumptions on what the story actually is/means. That means with each playthrough, every person might hear slightly different things. That by no means makes this replayable though. There is NO replayability in this game unless you desperately want to see what differences you can get. The enviroments don't change, trecking through each area is a bore after awhile, and the ending does not change. This game is only WALKING and LISTENING to dialogue. I swear if you replay Dear Esther, you have to either be crazy or a dedicated Wiki editor.TLDR; Dear Esther is an interesting take on narrative, but the long stretches between that narrative, ruthless lack of nothing if you dare go off the linear path and explore (expect a few meaningless narrative tidbits), and lack of replayability make this a less than par experiance.

												I would say this is a bad game.. but it's not good enough to be considered a ""game"".I can barely classify it as an interactive experience. BARELY.I can't call it a game because there is no degree of interaction in it. All you do is walk around (literally) with no interaction with anything what so ever. You do so at a blissfully slow speed as well, which makes the whole experience really tedious and boring. (That, and badly designed ""exploration""/ counter intuitive scenarios)The story was very confusing and I can't remember anything about it, it wasn't memorable at all and it didn't catch my attention. It's probably because I wasn't paying too much attention in the first place and because I heard it has a dynamic story that changes every time you play, possibly resulting in less effective storytelling, either way I wasn't impressed.The ""game"" was marketed and praised for it's gorgeous graphics, however I wasn't really blown away by them. I'm a long time PC gamer and I got to play some games  with pretty impressive graphics in the past... This didn't make it in my top 10. It all looks good in carefully captured screenshots but when you get to play it and look at things from up close you can notice the low quality textures and the grass planes rotating towards you... kind of ruined the ""realistic immersion"" experience they were going for. All in all, I do not recommend this ""game"" I don't think it's worth it. I would advise people to watch a ""Let's play"" of it on You tube, they would get the same experience.I was so dissapointed by this game that I personally mailed steam support to remove it from my library even though I paid it's full price. My library feels less tainted now :)			",420,129,7,33,29,7,46

												""Dear Esther isn’t a story about you. You don’t stem a tide of Islamic extremism with a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, you don’t save the Milky Way from a Reaper invasion, and you don’t stomp a bunch of Goombas on you way to save the princess. Dear Esther is a mystery. It’s a ghost story. It’s a historical document you unearth. It’s a first-person explorer, as opposed to first-person shooter, set on a Myst-like island where one narrator’s downward spiral is revealed in puzzling vignettes, rather than revealed by puzzling your way around levers and sliding boxes.""- Randy Kalista, ""Dear Esther vs The Bible""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On it's own as a story, it would be brilliant from what it shows, and I understand that it is interactive. but the 'game' feels linear, and slow a s***. Some of the tags on Steam are things like walking simulator, and I'd have to agree.

												Well, I finished the game and had a rough idea of what was happenning. I felt like I missed something and was curious so I read some guides, watched videos, etc. I must say I missed a lot what this game offers. At the same time it's impossible to see most of it on the first playthrough. It's quite nice when it comes to storytelling and exploration, but myself I haven't found a taste nor will to play it again. Maybe I will another day.If you are patient and looking for a nice chill adventure with beautiful music and scenery and mystery story, go and play it - the first playthrough is definitely worth it and will leave you somewhat sentimental.

												Don't get caught up in semantics. Whether this is a game or not, I found it to be a profound experience, that would not have worked in any other medium. The island is beautiful, and it as if the story itself is streched out to inhabit the space you treverse. This sense of space, of a story as space, is quite the achievement. Furthermore it does not enforce any persona on you, save the sound of footsteps; the player functions merely as a gaze in this thick space, and is told the story through the poetics of the island itself.The story conveyed itself is hauting, however, it is the form of this conveying, that is central to Dear Esther. The design does not answer any more questions than it needs to for the player to fill in the blanks whith his own imagination. It is dreamlike, but not meaningless, it is mysterious, but not a riddle, it is emotional, but not overwrought. To be enjoyed late at night with a single malt and a pensive disposition.

												Dear Esther is one of those games that some would argue is not a game. The mechanics are simple: walk. To people who would make such an argument, however, I would contend that Dear Esther is a shining example of how a game with the barest mechanic can deliver an experience wholly unique to this medium. As you explore the lonely terrain, narration adds context and emotion the experience. The player's actions reflect a relationship with these settings and messages. The game leaves you wondering just what things are at play in the lives discussed. The end is superbly executed. Games like this challenge our assumptions of what games are and how we engage with them. I hope to see more like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther is one of those games that some would argue is not a game. The mechanics are simple: walk. To people who would make such an argument, however, I would contend that Dear Esther is a shining example of how a game with the barest mechanic can deliver an experience wholly unique to this medium. As you explore the lonely terrain, narration adds context and emotion the experience. The player's actions reflect a relationship with these settings and messages. The game leaves you wondering just what things are at play in the lives discussed. The end is superbly executed. Games like this challenge our assumptions of what games are and how we engage with them. I hope to see more like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A superb experimentation in narration and what defines something as a game. This game isn't for everyone, and you may find yourself wondering why it is considered a game in the first place, but it is absolutely beautiful and fearlessly unique. I can't gush enough about how incredible the experience of playing Dear Esther is (and I've played through it a more than a few times by now). If you like good writing--and the writing in this case far exceeds good in my opinion, and I was a English Creative Writing major--you will love this game. Near perfection in its genre.

												Cool little story that is told through the thoughts of the charater you're playing. You get to explore the island on a fairly linear path with a few forks here and there. Some people may find the pace slow, as you can only walk, but I felt it fit well with the style of the game. I do recommend this game, but I suggest you wait for it to go on sale. It's a little too much for only an hour or so of gameplay.  Full Review	  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was initally turned off by this game that offered no guidelines, no explanation, just an island, and lots of drowning. Once I figured out where to start walking I became completely engrossed in the story. Dear Esther has done something in this format that few other games achieve: an immersive and haunting experience that lingers with you long after finishing. It's paced well, but I wish it were longer. 10/10.			",128,10,0,15,4,0,4

												Let me get this out of the way, Dear Esther is ploddingly slow and rather short. There is nothing to do but walk (not run or jump) around an island and listen to a story narrated to you in shor snippets. The story is told in a rather abstract and impressionistic manner. However the island is beautiful, the narration is well done, the prose is interesting and the over all experence is quite satisfying. Given how short it is I probably wouldn't reccomend paying full price, but definitely put Dear Esther on your wishlist and grab it next time it goes on sale.			",422,91,22,67,50,3,58

												Don't get caught up in semantics. Whether this is a game or not, I found it to be a profound experience, that would not have worked in any other medium. The island is beautiful, and it as if the story itself is streched out to inhabit the space you treverse. This sense of space, of a story as space, is quite the achievement. Furthermore it does not enforce any persona on you, save the sound of footsteps; the player functions merely as a gaze in this thick space, and is told the story through the poetics of the island itself.The story conveyed itself is hauting, however, it is the form of this conveying, that is central to Dear Esther. The design does not answer any more questions than it needs to for the player to fill in the blanks whith his own imagination. It is dreamlike, but not meaningless, it is mysterious, but not a riddle, it is emotional, but not overwrought. To be enjoyed late at night with a single malt and a pensive disposition.

I felt like I missed something and was curious so I read some guides, watched videos, etc. I must say I missed a lot what this game offers. At the same time it's impossible to see most of it on the first playthrough. It's quite nice when it comes to storytelling and exploration, but myself I haven't found a taste nor will to play it again. Maybe I will another day.If you are patient and looking for a nice chill adventure with beautiful music and scenery and mystery story, go and play it - the first playthrough is definitely worth it and will leave you somewhat sentimental.

												Well... what to say about this one?It's a walking simulator. There's a sort-of story, doled out in semi-random chunks as you go, which gives you an idea of what's going on... but ultimately, there are no puzzles, things to fight (or do) other than walk along a very linear track until you get to the end.So, this is not a game. It's a glorified demo with some moderately nice graphics. It's eerie, certainly. Atmospheric, definitely. There are some real ""Wow"" moments as you travel across the area you're in... but it's all a bit grim, and a bit slow... and really there's no point in repeating the process, so once you've finished this once, you're probably not going to want to do it again.If it's cheap, and you're into purple prose and don't like having to mash your mouse-button, then this might be the toy for you. Otherwise, I'd say give it a miss.I enjoyed it the first time around, but purely on the basis of how short it is (less than an hour) coupled with an almost total lack of replayability (for me, anyway) I'm going to not recommend this.

												I'm not going to go off on how it's not a game or anything like that, but even as an experience it was dull. I felt detatched from the story and I actually only completed the game because I thought with the original price being £7 that I would get some interactive moments or somehow become somewhat engrossed in the narration, instead I found myself feeling like I have just wasted 70 mins of my life. The soundtrack is stunning though and I do really love the scenery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is short... very short... I mean rediculously short, if it let you run through the game it would be over in 15-20 min. I can't really classify it as an exploration game simply due to the linearity of the game; even when there's a split in the road it makes no difference as you're still forced onto the same path.   The game tries so hard to bring you into this immersive experience, but when the only real control you have are looking around and walking around it's quite difficult to become immersed. Basically you'll be finding yourself holding down the W-key for about 2-3 hours, might as well have just had an auto-move key and then the game would have been just one long cinematic. It even turns the torch on for you. There's really no interaction with the environment.   Sadly though the camera work is a serious let-down it glides along so smoothly it just doesn't feel like walking and the lack of arms/legs/torso/anything make it feel like you're just a flying camera. So I don't even think it makes a good walking simulator.    If not for the enivironment artists this game would be unplayable, and they were absolutely amazing. One of the most beautifully created environments I've ever seen and the developers did well to keep it interesting throughout the game.The acting in the narration is very well done but without any decent camera work and game mechanics it doesn't feel entirely connected with the gameplay and as such it makes the plot seem unimportant and instead of filling you with deep emotion for the characters really just makes you feel impatient or apathetic towards the whole thing. If you removed the island and just had the narration the plot would not be damaged.     Basically you play a game as a flying camera which moves very slowly and shoots pretty scenery while a man reads letters and talks about the plot. If the developers put more effort into the player character in terms of movement, interaction with the environment and animation/ character visuals the game would have been a lot deeper and I would probably have recommended it. Sadly though it's interesting but in no way is it worth the $10 price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Esther is the first game made by The Chinese Room, and it is great. While it's not really a game - more of a walking simulator - Dear Esther gives an interesting world to explore with stunning visuals and a great OST. The voice acting is good, too. The story is what makes Dear Esther great though, it is told very well. This game isn't for everyone, but if you like exploration, check it out!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If there's anything about video games that I'm good at, it's In-Game suicide. I've fallen off of bridges, into crevasses, stepped on traps, landed on spikes, drowned, and immolated myself in virtual reality more times than I can count.Enter Dear Esther. Oh, it's beautiful. I want to go to the Hebrides islands now. There's a cave with all this well-rendered bioluminescent stuff on the walls, and I just want to reach out and--click it.But I can't.Because I can't interract with anything in this game.I can just wander around and listen to some story about feeling guilty and personal demons. It seems to get told out of order depending on where on the island I am, and the random audio snippets I get don't really correspond to the location that I'm at.So, bored with not being able to click anything and listening to this guy carry on about regrets, etcetera, I decide to go for a swim. My character can't swim. I get 'resurrected' back on land.After another half-hour of wandering around, and again getting sick of the narrator's personal demons, I find a giant hole in the ground.In the interest of scientific research, I jump into it.And I get resurrected again.It's like one of those stories about a guy who is immortal and he's bored and annoyed, so he tries to end it all, but just ends up being bored and annoyed with gashes in his wrists because he's immortal and doomed to be tormented forever.So, finally, I find out where I'm supposed to be wandering and what this guy is regretting, and as I climb the aerial tower (SPOILERS!), I'm thinking, ""finally, this game is going to let me actually have control over *something*.""I get to the top of the tower and scripting takes over.And as my character throws himself automatically from the tower the small part of me that was engaged in this story felt like the ultimate failure.My character had absolutely no control over his own destiny. Every time he tried to kill himself, he got dragged back to life: YOU WILL KILL YOURSELF ONLY WHEN IT PLEASES THE SCRIPT! And when it comes time to kiss the cruel world goodbye, he doesn't even get to do THAT himself.Anyway, my character should rest in peace knowing that it wasn't his fault he hit some lady while drink driving. The script made him do it.So yeah. Effective story telling, just not in the way intended. ",15,13,0,4,1,0,3

In the very, very short time it lasted (less than an hour!), I could not grasp the apparently purposedly vague and confusing storyline at all, and since the story is everything this game has (the gameplay is only walking forward), I cannot say I'm happy. The monologues of the protagonist were full of red herrings and other pointless distractions, and the ending was about as predictable and cliched as I expected. The environments were pretty nice at times, but it is simply not enough to make a game by itself.			",305,93,7,36,34,4,56

												I'm not sure what the story is exactly about, but there is something captivating in the process of walking through environment of Dear Esther. Graphically is very beautifully, the cave details, house even the sound of birds and wind. With no doubt is great experience, yes because this is ""no game"". I have seen Point'n'Click games with a better story, but this a different in good way! Although the narrative on this game is da best! The narrator has an excellent voice, sometimes i got sad when he finish to talk.One thing that really bug me is.. what speed are we walking? My god the character walks super slow and that is super boring. Well if you are looking into a new experience, a nice visual game, good OST, but this game! ~ 7,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was not really my thing.The game is beautiful, but it is very boring.Before I played it I didn't even know there was a ""walking simulator"" genre.Well, keep walking Johnnie. I will go somewhere else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Videogames are art.  This isn't art.  This is barely a videogame!  This is literally  a suicide simulator though.  I found that out by level skipping and noclipping to the end because it's a source game and your walk speed is atrocious.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While you play ""Dear Esther"" you get the feeling you are exploring a work of art... perhaps even a painting.  The music is excellent and harmonizes with the scenery.... perfectly setting an atmosphere that is both haunting and beautiful.  The two main problems with this game (it's not really a game but more of a semi-interactive story) is that you never get the feeling that you are really here, walking around and exploring an island...  You can't interact with the world in any way and I noticed, despite the developers attempt at extreme realistic scenery, there are thing out of place... such as no ripples when you walk through the water and perhaps too many textures of trash scattered throughout the island.  I also had a problem getting drawn into some of the details of the story and characters.  I teach video game design and one of the key elements in a good design is getting your customer to love and care about the characters.  I think the design falters here however by the time you reach the end (which is extremely short, took me only a couple hours) and the plot plays out, you do come away with a feeling of understanding.

												I don't exactly know what kind of emotions this ""game"" was supposed to cause, but it sure did not do it for me. In the very, very short time it lasted (less than an hour!), I could not grasp the apparently purposedly vague and confusing storyline at all, and since the story is everything this game has (the gameplay is only walking forward), I cannot say I'm happy. The monologues of the protagonist were full of red herrings and other pointless distractions, and the ending was about as predictable and cliched as I expected. The environments were pretty nice at times, but it is simply not enough to make a game by itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this. It's a tech demo disguised as a game. You just walk, walk, walk and walk, while some idiot reads some nonsense letter out loud.Sure it looks beautiful, but I find Valve highly questionable to even consider selling this. And had it not been because it runs on the Source engine, they probably wouldn't have.There's as much interactivity as in a video.Actually, the trailer above pretty much sums up the entire ""game"".

												What can you say? This game is fckn ingenious. The story. They say the story is everything, you know. Have you ever walked through the island with the wind in your hair? Just you and the Island.. And HER.. Just wanted to go to sleep forever? Are you sleeping? Are you awake and walking? Are you YOU?? Is the story telling about you, or are you telling the story? I dont care, i am just walking, listening to those words, sentences, listening to those magnificient sounds. The island has me. The story has me. I am caught in some infinite loop. Is it about me? Or is it about her? Does not matter.. Its about... What's between 'em...Passport to Heaven...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The walking pace is so slow, it's off putting for me. I got the essense of the story pretty quick, fairly obvious, and that made it hard to sit through the whole thing. It also gives you the idea of open world but you can only follow one route with a few diversions. Never played a game that just requires you to enjoy the walk, was fun, but not going to get into more of these.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
