												When I first saw this game, I thought it would be a lot of fun: massive battles, chopping up minions, being a big damn nordic hero. I wasn't entirely wrong, but I wasn't right either. Viking: Battle for Asgard is a 3rd person hack and slash action adventure game. You play as Skarin, a Viking warrior blessed by Freya, tasked with saving Midgard (yet it's called battle for Asgard..). It takes place on 3 different islands of various sizes. It contains zero notable RPG elements, no loot, no stats, and no detailed information at all. You buy skills (moves) before really knowing much about it, you buy upgrades but don't really know how it differs from the previous one, besides it's better. It is straight forward and fairly linear. Occasionally you have multiple tasks that can be completed in any order, but they all must be completed before progressing to the next area so there really is no choice involved. There are also some strange stealth sections that just feel thrown in. Maybe they were trying to break up the hack and slash monotony, which is successful, but because it varies so much from the rest of the gameplay, you really never feel equipped correctly to do them. Those sections feel very out of place, especially when they also have a collecting bit thrown in to them (for a few achievements only) but are never explained whatsoever as to why you would be collecting the things in the first place unless you read the achievements ahead of time. You may stumble across one of the skulls, but would never know what the heck you had collected unless you read the achievements. Just seems poorly implemented.Aside from those skulls, there really aren't any secrets to be found. I like to thoroughly explore areas looking for hidden objects or areas, but there are none to be found. You may occassionally come across a random sack of gold or chest (which only contain gold or a quest item), but that's about it. Because of this, there doesn't feel like much of a reason to explore (even when you're on a rather linear path).Visuals: Because this is a console port from Xbox 360/PS3, its graphics are similar to that generation of game. As with a lot of ports, the game is very poorly optimized for PC. It lags pretty noticibly in large battles, it has no Field of View slider, very few graphics options, and the FPS is locked at 30. There is a guide on Steam that will help get the game looking better, but it still cannot unlock the FPS but will change the FOV. Before changing it, there were times when moving the camera made my eyes hurt but even then, turning the camera seemed to blur the screen in a nauseating manner. All that said, I enjoyed the visuals. There were times when things looked really impressive, scenery looked gorgeous, and combat felt visceral. I think the Creative Assembly did a great job crafting a believable world. It felt consistant and nothing really felt out of place. Small details like fences looked like they really tried to make it fit and appear to belong there. Area layouts made sense. One of the worst things to me were the animations. Some were just straight strange (dragon summoning looks like your character just collapses and goes ragdoll) and others were just lazy. Every time you fight a Giant, the 3 different Quick Time Events are animated exactly the same, every single time. The first time you see it, you think, wow, that's pretty cool; But after seeing the same thing 9 times, it gets boring and you're just waiting for it to end. Even the dismemberment kills start to get boring after a while as there only appears to be 5 or so different variations.I think had they actually put in effort on optimization and unlocking the FPS; This game would have been recieved much better on PC.Controls: I played it with a wireless Xbox 360 controller and it felt pretty good. I did not try it with keyboard/mouse at all so I cannot say how those were, but right when you load up the game, it specifically says it was designed for a controller. The controls are rather simple to understand and build slowly in complexity. The combat does get rather repetative as you end up using the same few moves as you progress. As mentioned above, the game  has Quick Time Events when fighting tough enemies. They're not particulary hard the first time you do them, and then shift into mind numbingly easy as you progress because the pattern does not change. There's only one kill animation for giants, so there's only one pattern to use every time you kill one. It's repetative and lacks any excitement.As mentioned above the camera was a problem. It seemed to have a habit of working against you any chance it got, allowing for a sword to your backside. Targeting was also rather strange and likes to work against you. Targeting in Viking seems to rely on auto locking on the target nearest to you, that's fine except when you're getting attacked from multiple sides and are trying to attack a specific enemy before they stike you, only to lunge at a different enemy and get hit multiple times in the back. What makes it worse is that even though you are swinging a sword and axe, you can only seem to hit one target at a time (unless using a special attack). Sure, your swing may go through multiple enemies (especially when they're clipping inside one another) but the same will only register a hit on one, which one can be hard to determine ahead of time.All said, I still recommend the game but not at full price. If it's under $5 and you like action adventure, hack and slash, or vikings, it's worth it. It's fun enough, the achievements are quite achieveable, and has a run time of 15-20 hours. There are worse ways to spend a weekend. 6/10			",603,235,24,101,42,3,73

For Asgard!!!Viking: Battle for Asgard is the second  third person hack and slash, adventure game developed by Creative Assembly (following Spartan: Total warrior). You play as Skarin a nord warrier chosen by the Godess Freiar to defeat the Godess Hel and her forces who threaten to destroy Midgard.The Good+ Massive battles- There battle sequences where hundreds of troops clash.+ Unique viking mythology - From the towns, units, monsters, environement you get a nordish feeling through ou the game.+ 3 big maps to explore - Maps have are big and will take time to explore the settlements, dungeons, caves etc.+ New moves to learn - You can learn new moves through purchasing them at certain sites. These moves have certain strengths and weakness such as breaking through enemy defences, stuns or destroying shields.+ Extra collectables - You can find hidden skulls in each map which earns you an achievement.+ Quick travel shrines - You can warp between shrines by locating them.+ Magical powers - You can purchase and upgrade three spells (ice,electricity, fire) which buffs you weapon and nearby allies as well.+ Blood and gore - Combat is bloody as you hack limbs off foes.The Bad- Clunky keyboard and mouse controls due to poor port- Moveing around the place feels unecessarily cumbersome.- Lag - Faced lag spikes even after lowering graphics. Since game is old,  lag is caused by poor optimisation for pc.- Combat is not fun - The problem is that you can't counter enemy attacks, so your forced to constantly block and wait, which becomes troublesome when you are surrounded. Enemies also run faster than you so you hyave to constant block or fight them.- No sprint- With a massive map to explore, moving around can take a long time even with quick travel. - Poor map - Navigateing your map is done via keyboard controls, not mouse. It is also difficult to select an area on the map as you need to shift between regions via keyboard.- 30 FPS cap - There is no way to remove this and makes animations appear slow.- Limited weapons - You are stuck with sword, axe, throwing axes (unlock bombs later on) through out the entire game. - Poorly implemented stealth - The stealth sections feel tacked on and don't fit in the game at all.- Quick time events - Occurs during combat sewquences and gets cumbersome after a while.- Limited healing items - You can only carry 3 healing potions at a time and they don't heal you by much either. The problem comes prevailent in combat when you are in desperate need of healing.- Limited stores - Each map has only one settlement where you can buy and upgrade items. This forces you to travel back and forth over and over again to re-supply which is time consuming.- Poor voice acting - You won't care for the characters at all.- Uninteresting story - Plot is mediocre with no real plot twist, except at the end, but even that wasn't good.- Executeing unnecessary - After damaging a foe enough, you can execute them by pressing the 'E' key. The problem though is that there is no point as the enemy will bleed out if left alone and don't attack you. Although most of time executing this ability will render you invincible for a short time, some enemies may by pass this.- Limited enemies - You will face swordsman, shield guys, giants, archers, shaman, axe wielders and assassins. It sounds like alot, but as you play you will see the same enemies again and again. Final verdictOverall this game was mediocre, with the weakness hampering alot of the game play. If you are planning to pick this up I highly recommend playing on easy, just so that combat is less cumbersome as health pick ups are more common.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Decent game, horrible port.Viking: Battle for Asgard has a potential concept: a conflict between the Viking and the Legion Army. You a.k.a the chosen warrior will build up the Viking army and lead them into the war. This game has all essential factors for a great mini sandbox hack-n-slash game: combat feels good, although it gets a little bit repetitive after 3 hours, gore effect are sick, impressive large scale battles, great characters' design and some lite RPG elements. However, it has some shortcomings such as lack of enemies' variety, boring boss battles and running from a camp to another site feels tedious (you can fast travel at some locations called Lairstone or Laystone or what-ever-the-hell-it-is), also navigating the map is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I would have given this game a 6.8/10....butLet me remind you the origin of this game:Viking: Battle for Asgard was released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2008......and PC version got released in 2012. What do we have ? Enhanced graphics and kb/m support.Keyboard and mouse work great. Graphic is somewhat mediocre but it didn't bother me at all.But there's one funny thing is that the dev - Hardlight Studio made effort in enhancing graphics but they didn't UNLOCK FRAMERATE.This game is hard locked at 30FPS, there's no way to unlock it. I'm personally fine with 30FPS, but the problem is framerate drops very often, which makes combat less accurate. Once framerate drops below 20, the game runs in slow motion, YES FULL SLOW MOTION, and this happens randomly. For example, I was talking to an innkeeper, after 2 seconds, framerate drops to 15 for no good reason at all. In large scale battles with a large numbers of soldiers on screen, my laptop still can keep the framerate at 30, but when I get into a cave, which has less objects to render, framerate drops and the game goes into slow motion for 5 or 6 seconds. I don't understand what happened, why did the dev made efforts in making kb/m compatible and enhancing graphics, but managed to ♥♥♥♥ up the framerate ? I just don't get it.Viking: Battle for Asgard is a decent game ruined by technical problems. I had a good time chopping dudes' heads off and I'd say this game's well worth $4, but this horrible port is one of a hundread reasons why PC gamers are boycotting SEGA (Rome 2: Total War I'm looking at you). Hardlight, next time please don't ♥♥♥♥ up another game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BUY IT IF ITS ON SALE-8/10No game is perfect. Some have iffy controls, others have lame stories, and a few just have weak enemies, but even with these natural foibles, glitches and hang-ups, a videogame can transcend its limitations and be heralded as a title where the sum is greater than the parts.That isn't the case with Viking: Battle for Asgard.Set in the time when the Norse Gods ruled and people hid gold in glowing urns for some inexplicable reason, Viking, the latest from SEGA and Creative Assembly, tosses you into the massive boots of Skarin, a shirtless warrior who packs a sword and battleaxe. The game opens with Skarin mortally wounded and about to take a one-way trip to Valhalla, but Freya -- Odin's daughter -- steps in to save the Schwarzenegger-like brute as long as he pledges allegiance to her and promises to go after Hel, queen of the Underworld. Skarin agrees, gets this glowing amulet from Freya, and we're off!Now, taking on the queen of the damned isn't a one-man gig. The problem is, Hel's Legion -- an army of blue-skinned, undead bad guys -- is roaming the countryside and has imprisoned the very Vikings who would be willing to fight alongside Skarin. This means that the majority of your time in Viking is spent scouring the mountain tops and grassy plains looking for men who are usually locked in giant ribcage prisons or tethered to skull poles. Find the camps, kill the Legion, and free the men. From there, the troops usually give you some task to complete such as gathering a healing honey or eliminating a traitor, and once the odd job is complete, they join your team.See, you're freeing all of these soldiers for the massive battles that Viking revolves around. When you tap Select and bring up your map, you'll find it covered with various icons indicating enemy encampments, friendly bases and more. Of the enemy kind, you'll see some that have conditions -- free X number of troops, find the battle horn, etc. -- that must be met before you can complete the task. Usually, these are the massive battles that act as a middle and end to the level.Once you meet the battle conditions, you can select the icon on the map and jump straight into the war. Here's where all of the troops you've saved march into battle with you. If you haven't seen these skirmishes in action, they can be pretty impressive. Each one starts with a cutscene depicting a sea of your men marching toward a sea of enemies. Dragons fly overhead, Shaman are casting ominous spells in the distance, and giants wait at the ready. When the scene ends, you're thrust into the battle the imagery just set up. You and hundreds of your men move towards hundreds of enemies.Although there's no way to control what your men are doing, they're generally pretty good about following you and helping the best they can -- that is by beating the living hell out of all the blue-skinned freaks that get in their way. While your boys on the ground tend to the Legion horde, you're pretty much on your own as far as ending the battle. Each scenario has win conditions such as eliminating two of the three Shamans or taking care of a few giants. Once you've completed the tasks, your troops can move deeper into the base, you'll get a new set of objectives, and the beat goes on. In the end, you have to call your Shaman to the base's heart and have her switch it to good			",215,24,6,10,20,4,8

												Game is very, very repetitive, but its also (very) enjoyable if you are into hack and slashy games, with gore. The game is open world, in segments. The lack of sprinting ability, or even mounts can hurt a bit if you are going from point A to point B. One of my pet peeves in most games are QTE's. This game has this aspect for finish kills, which is enjoyable to do. excessive use of QTE in this game will annoy the average player, giving that later in the game you are expected to use it, if you want to defeat a enemy completely. The open large scale battle is a nice tough and a site to see, especially when you don't see that often in many games. You can tell this game took ques from the Total War series, which you'll have a very basic, really basic sample of RTS in the climatic large scale battle parts of the game. The decision making in this game has no major consequences, if any at all. Graphics is very, very dated. At times you'll feel like you're looking at a Xbox (original Xbox) game in high-res. I could ramble on and on about this game, but ill cut it short. I enjoyed the game, enjoyed the combat but the story still had me either confused or feeling in a ho-hum-i don't care kind of mood. Play it for the combat and be ready to nitpick its lack of features you can find in other games. Note: A controller is a must if you want to fully enjoy the game			",1252,355,43,130,109,15,147

												Its nice game but not for all. Huge open world and a lot of tasks to do. Epic battles with magic, special enemys and dragons under your command. You can upgrade your magic, buy some weapons or potions and penetrate islands to release vikings. Now disadventages. There were moments when game was slowling and it was like fighting in slow motion. I heard that many people had the same problem. Second thing, on all islands you make almost the same (for me it wasnt a big problem but i have to say it) make army, find dragon, release something. And at the end dragons animations and last boss (it was the biggest disappointment for me). Just think before buying it.MaxGregor			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets get the bad things out of the way, the voice acting disgusts me, the controls can be pretty confusing, and I find myself having to look up what to do because the instruction is just so poor. It wasn't set up great, but there is a lack of Viking games in the gaming community. They do bring out the aspect of Vikings well in this game, its a hack n slash where you recruit hundreds of vikings to your army and every now and then get into huge battles where its like something out of the Lord of The Rings. You can use dragons to decimate the enemys, and  chop the Legions filthy limbs off at your leisure. Overall, it's ok, it's worth a play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, this game could have been much better if not for the very bad PC port. The game is capped at 30 FPS, which become apparent from the first minute and the PC optimization is just plain terrible.STORYThe plot build on norse mythology, which gives it a unique setting, however it falls short in execution. There are many unanswered questions about the main character and the ending kinda defeated the point of the whole game. In short it's about a champion chosen by a norse god vs. the other norse god.COMBATHack and slash genre, good finishing moves, nice death animations. Nothing wrong here, the only problem is it gets boring by the time you reach the second island, even with the upgraded combos. The giants are the most annoying bosses in the game, because it takes so long to kill them.The big battles are really good, including the RTS elements with the dragons. GAMEPLAYMoving around the island is incredibly slow. The developers should have really added a sprint button, because you run like a slow ox. The fast travel system just isn't enough, I always killed myself so I that I would respawn at a fast travel point.I give this game a 5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Looking at the quite bad ratings this game has received, one thing should be made clear:  at its core, Viking: Battle for Asgard isn't a bad game.I do understand the reason behind the mostly negative reviews however, the game had a lot of unused potential and does seem like a rushed product. It's a shame, because the graphics are nice, the islands (where the game takes place) are fairly big and the mythological Viking setting seems good enough.So what's wrong with the game then? First of all the environment (as beautiful as it is) feels empty: no wildlife, no random events. The landscape with high cliffs, ghost ships near the shore and small groves looks exciting, but it quickly degrades into emptiness as we progress. Still the game is worth to take a look and even a playthrough.The story seems interesting enough at the beginning: Freya, the Viking goddess of love and war (in this case it's the latter) seeks out and blesses a dying warrior, Skarin, to make him her champion and lead the Viking forces against the Legion, the undead army (they look like orcs from the Lord of the Rings) of the queen of the underworld, Hel, who threatens to destroy Asgard (and Midgard). There's a twist at the end, but it doesn't really add much to the game. The story is told via cutscenes consisting of red-orange-black-white colored still images.Practically, the game is a mixture of third person hack and slash with slight adventure and even slighter strategy elements. You have to free captured Viking warriors and liberate settlements on 3 groups of islands (3 levels basically). After doing all the missions on each island, a large scale battle takes place where you must lead the Viking army against the forces of Hel. These battles look pretty impressive and amazing (there are hundreds of warriors on screen) but the poor controls (console port) take its toll: they can quicky turn into a chaotic mess, if you don't focus on the main targets. Here you have to kill shamans who summon the undead warriors and despite the urging of your fellow brethren, you have plenty of time to do so. You can utilize the help of dragons who can kill these shamans with a single breath of fire, but in order to do that, you'll need to kill shamans to recharge the dragon amulet... so you kill a shaman (or 2) in the conventional way, then you can kill the next one automatically. The shamans are invulnerable first, only after destroying their staves/totems can they be killed. At the end of the game you must face Hel herself, but surprisingly this battle is a piece of cake (what leads up to that point however isn't).As I said before the missions are quite similar: find barrels of mead, liberate encampments. The scenery however makes the exploring interesting, you can get to abandoned mines, to the top of windmills, ghost towns and caves. Sometimes you'll have to be sneaky (you can kill oppontents with a single blow from behind) and there is an achievement for finding red skulls, which really doesn't add anything apart from earning the achievement itself.There's currency (gold) in the game, with which you can buy new battle combinations, magic (ice, fire, lightning, in that order if we look at their usefulness), health extensions (permanent upgrade), health potions, throwing axes (for taking out enemies from afar), fire bombs (against multiple enemies, but they are very weak) and treasure maps (useless, you're going to find most of them - if not all - anyway). The combos are the most important things to buy, without them, you have no chance to kill more than a single opponent in combat. These can be bought at stone circles from Viking ghosts, so I suggest to look for these from the very beginning of the game. Combos can be used after collecting rage points (you can acquire 5 maximum). The use of magic isn't as good as it sounds, basically you can imbue your axe with the appropriate element (ice is the best since it freezes then shatters the enemy instantly). You can slowly recharge your magic by killing enemies and collecting the red orbs they leave behind. Unfortunately death has no consequences at all (aside from the enemies respawning in the given area, which happens anyway if you leave and haven't cleared it out completely), so while health potions can be useful, their use isn't mandatory.The controls are going to be the cause of many deaths, since Skarin can only fight one opponent at a time and seems to be 'locked' onto that single target, while most of the time the player must fight 3+ (sometimes a dozen or even more) enemies simultaneously. You can block and even dodge, but apparently these moves have been designed for duels, so by dodging you can accidentaly jump into the claws of another enemy... when facing 3 or more enemies the use of magic is heavily advised (fortunately you can use it even if it's not filled up completely).While Skarin runs extra slowly, there are plenty of portal stones that can speed up your travels (it's still going to take plenty of time). The enemies come in 5-6 different versions, some of them using shields, bows or dual-axes, but you don't really need more in a Viking themed hack and slash game. There are also ogres (killing them requires to perform successfully in QTE - quick time events - pressing buttons with correct timing) and champions. Killing these enemies is pretty easy, but again, most of the time you'll have to fight others as well simultaneously.Visually the game is beautiful (at least the landscape), the view distance is great and there are many castle ruins, cliffs and windmills from which you can admire the wonderful scenery. The music is fitting, but nothing spectacular and the sound effects feel weak and poor.The game is definitely worth checking out, it's not even remotely as bad as the user reviews would suggest. Sure it's not a deliberately good game, there are too many things missing from it, but it doesn't do anything that bad either. If you are looking for a hack and slash game between two more serious titles go ahead and give it a try.As most of you probably know, this game was part of a free bundle from SEGA, so I wrote this review as if it was a free game.PROS+ nice scenery, interesting locations+ Viking settingCONS- lack of content- bad, console based controls- missions has no real rewards- dying has basically no consequenceRATING5/10			",88,74,0,10,4,0,8

												This game got mediocre reviews at best, but the video still caught my attention and I decided to give it a try. I was pretty pleasantly surprised.To start, this is not a deep game. There are next to no RPG elements. Think of it as a GoW type game. The animations are a little clunky and a controller is crucial. It is definitely a console port. Many people also complained about it being grindy. There are only 3 islands, and completing them really is much the same. However, I didn't mind because I enjoyed the gameplay.That being said, this was a great game to come home to and just mindlessly kill. For much of the game, you're running solo and taking on small groups of enemies with your typical combat. Explore areas and delve into caves. Free guard towers and small forts. It's all typical stuff. However, the game shines in the variety of battles.To take back control of an important area, you must clear that area of enemies. Sometimes this is easier said than done. Luckily, there is usually a prison full of captured comrades nearby. Just sneak in and free them and they help in the fight! This type of battle changes the game into a small melee.Then you have ambushes. On certain areas of the map, the bad guys have patrols running around. These things are big (20-30+ troops( so you aren't going to be attacking them solo. Get enough allies and prepare an ambush. These battles are slightly bigger than he melees but fast paced and action packed.You can also do stealth missions in an enemy occupied city. Again, you run around solo, but you're in the middle of the enemy control zone. This means anything less than perfect stealth will result in death. You sneak by most opponents but occasionally stop to assassinate a guard or five.Finally is the big daddy... the city seiges. They come in various sizes and complexities, but each of them needs you to persuade an entire army to join you. And believe me... you take an army. This part of the game almost reminds me of DotA. Enemies constantly respawn from their Shamen and you have to influence the outcome of the battle by taking on the Shamen as well as other important commanders and troops. You also bring dragons with you after you unlock them (3 in all). They fly around and pretend to fight until you give them commands. Basically you just tell them a target to kill (strategic targets or the mini bosses mentioned above). Using the dragons doesn't get too detailed, but it adds great atmosphere to the battles. These things are chaotic!All in all, it isn't going to win Game of the Year or anything, but I had a ton of fun. It was one of the few games that I played right through without getting bored.

												Viking: Battle for Asgard is, at first glance, an inoffensively mediocre hack and slasher that's a bit like God of War if it was set in Magic Scandinavia and featured a mute meat freezer disguised as a man instead of a screaming psychotic ballerina dancer. And for the most part, it's exactly that. Slower, heavier combat, magic limited to spicing up your sword blows, and all the platforming and puzzles replaced with incredibly basic stealth mechanics.The game is so utterly devoid of original thought that it's hard to give it a proper review. While this isn't in and of itself worthy of a negative recommendation, this incredibly formulaic game falls apart on the eve of the giant battles that end each level. Before you can summon your ever growing army and your small collection of dragons and just drop them on the enemy's head, you always are made to sneak through your enemy's base to accomplish one task or the other, while snatching up the stores of gold they have scattered 'round.Its these parts where the game screeches to a halt, because the method of enforcing stealth basically consists of placing ten times the normal density of enemies in an area and telling you to sneak around assassinating exactly the right ones, because if even one of them spots you, you have about six seconds before every enemy within a hundred feet dogpiles you, and unlike say Assassin's Creed, the enemies here have zero concept of Mook Chivalry, and will happily stunlock you to death, dumping you back at your base to start the entire process over from scratch.I've personally made it a little over halfway through the game, but after repeating the exact same scenario about three dozen times, the game's sluggish combat loses its charm and I can't say I care how the game ends anymore. Probably predictably, given the flow of every other aspect of the story.			",101,21,0,17,4,0,1

												You are going to need an xbox controller and a very powerful computer for this, otherwise don't bother!But if you have one you may find it as enjoyable as I do. Slay the enemy, pillage and loot, what's not to like?Even on my fast rig I had to tune the graphics down in order not to play in slow motion but it still looks pretty good when you do.Big islands, free roam, kill, slay, hack, slash, berserkerrrrrrrr :)			",190,144,25,22,27,3,38

												Viking: Battle for Asgard is a decent enough game. Story is mediocre, mechanics are okay, if repeatative. The art and music are fairly good, graphics are surprisingly still passable, if a bit bright. Buy this game only if it's on sale, and only if you like lot's of hack n' slash fighting mixed with the occasional battle set piece. QTEs are sins I don't often forgive, and niether is being a lazy port, but, this game is alright with me, regardless. If you've played Brutal Legend, and enjoyed it, but wanted a more serious attempt at a similar style game, you'll probably like this. Probably.			",23,4,0,11,6,0,16

												I think this game gets a bad rap personally. I had a lot of fun with it. Plus, this game does what more should, focus on having a simple goal and then have a world that allows the player to choose what and when they do things. It feels organic, and less restrictive than most modern games. Developers need to lean gamers do not like they're hands being held all the time. Plus, how can you not love the massive siege sections? HOW?! Now, the game is definitely not perfect. First off, I'd recommend straight away playing with a controller. They keyboard just doesn't suit it. Secondly, the boss fights are awful. Including the last boss AND as much as I said developers should focus on simple stories/goals I think the games plot could of done with a bit more exposition.			",237,40,2,19,11,0,6

												Fairly cool large battles, adequate-ish story and VIKINGS! However:Horrible voice acting, clunky and dated animation, poor responsiveness for an action-y type game and sub-standard optimisation for PC.Those things covered..... the controls are AWFUL. This is a console port. A port that makes bad ports look good. I picked this up on heavy discount (I'd read bad things about it) because it had VIKINGS, but I still regret the purchase, even at that price.			",118,20,1,34,25,1,28

												My first Creative Assembly product was Spartan: Total Warrior back on the PlayStation 2. Despite all the mediocre press attention, I personally believe it was a remarkable title and an extremely good contender against well established franchises such as God of War or even games of similar scale such as Dynasty Warriors. Viking on the other hand doesn't quite live up to the same standards, but isn't all that bad once you get into grips with how the gameplay works and familiarise yourself with the core mechanics. Your main objective is to pretty much assembe an army big enough to reclaim the lands. More or less Lord of the Rings, but with vikings. You need to complete favours for individual clans/groups in order to gain their trust and expertise. All in all there's three islands to conquer with the first island serving more as a tutorial and introduction to how everything works. At the beginning controls may feel a bit tedious but that's something you'll get used to by the time you complete the first island. Although I felt the main protagonist was uninspiring and quite simply dull, he manages to pull his own in combat once you acquire special attacks from spirits of Valhalla at arenas; and magical skills from the Blacksmith which promote magical skills - fire, ice and lightning. Major boss encounters are also on the underwhelming side as they fail to display any real challenge, although the battle leading up to the final encounter is far more challenging . There's a lot of running around between objectives which may become a drag at later stages where the landscape is remarkably bigger. Overall I was personally satisfied with the product to some extent, but wish it were similar to that of Spartan where the player could somewhat relate to a speaking protagonist in a brutal and relentless title.

												Viking is a simple game that  could have been much more.  There are so many open-world games today that may overshadow it.  Still, Viking is a solid game that sticks to it's formula and executes it very well.  Like I said, it is simple but it is good.     The fighting is a minimalistic Light and heavy attacks and jumps. Several modifiers, however, such as pressing a shoulder button to change the attacks into trowables or into majic spells or double tapping buttons make it much more fun and satisfying.     Unlike, say: a God Of War, this game is much slower and less flashy but in a good way.  You really get to see and almost ''feel'' the rib-crushing strikes done onto your opponents without all kinds of sprites blocking the view.  The game also shares God of War's Quick Time Event button pressing to a much more annoying and unnessessary extent.  Overall, the game is a must buy whenever it is on a steam sale and I reccomend the gamepad when playing it.			",259,16,3,11,7,0,12

												Ever play Dynasty Warriors? Take Dynasty Warriors, dilute the plot, simplify their already simplistic combat system, cheapen the voice acting, and you have Viking. This is a great game, if you buy it as an under $5 special and maintain an expectation for a $5 game.Pros:-Live your dreams of being a badass viking in a hack-and-slash-Respectable map size and somewhat diverse enemy base structures/setups-Hints of excitement and promise in early questCons:-Plot lacks substance and allure to keep you going-Combat is excessively simplistic, the thrills of being a viking wears fast-Plenty of repetitive map traveling-Voice acting is painful enough that it should be substituted for subtitles and a Metallica CD playing on repeat.-Feels and was a cheap game for its timeLots of potential, loved the idea of the game and really wanted to like the game, but there just wasn't enough substance. 5/10 at best			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Viking Battle For Asgard is a poor port of the PS3 and Xbox360 version. It runs at 30FPS, max, but somehow it manages to -look- even slower. The game itself is alright though. The graphics don't exactly hold up, but they still look okay I guess. Same goes for the voice acting and sounds. The gameplay itself consists of hacking through hundreds of enemies while freeing Vikings and doing other quests scattered across the land. They'll eventually aid you in some big battles, which look impressive, considering the amount of NPCs they use.Every now and then the game will give you a stealth mission. The engine wasn't built for stealth, and it's noticable, since I can guarantee you that you'll be attracting enemies. It's a sucky aspect that shouldn't have been there to begin with.Besides, the game will most likely start to bore you when you're halfway through. It's just the same thing again and again. Skip it.[Rating: 70/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												To write a review someone has to finish the game in question.Boy, was it tedious with this one, and i'm going to explain why:First of all: the gameplay.Incredibly dull and with a weak punch to it, every ""a"" smashing combat will become not only repetitive but programmed aswell, as the AI in combat will all act the same (even tho there are only FOUR mobs in the entire game). Making most of the moves completely useless.Second of all: that disgusting map.Not the map as the world itself, aside from it, which is bland as stone of course, but the map itself. I've never seen a more deceiving map than this one (and i finished the zork trilogy) most of the time you'll just wander through the land wondering where the hell you are actually supposed to go because an entrance to a certain zone on a map is NEVER in the most obvious path. So you get to walk all around the map to get to specific parts on a quest.Third: the quests and the mobsLiterally both of them can be counted on the palm of my hand and repeated a thousands times.Quests: Liberate camp. Find gem to summon dragon. Attack Shamans/giants. Rinse and repeat.Mobs: 4 generic orcs from no armor to lots of armor and shield. Giants.  That's it.Little obnoxious things: qte's stuffed everywhere (opening doors, killing mobs, summoning..), bugged jumping mechanicsIn conclusion, the game doesn't introduce itself as something pretentious, but down to earth, which makes us hope they could not ♥♥♥♥ it up such a simple couple as ""vikings"" and ""hack n slash"". It's not the worst hack n slash i've experienced, but it's the definition of mediocrity in hack n slash games.5.5/10			",329,52,12,22,23,4,39

												I thought this was going to be a poor man's God of War, but it actually felt like a worse version of an old game called Rune from back in the day.Story:You are a blank piece of paper named Skarin, he has no character, he is you. You are a Viking. You are chosen as a champion for Freya and fight Hel. There are some interesting bits thrown in for flavor as the game progresses. Not really compelling as it's played out in just a series of missions with the occasional cut scene. It's just there to bridge the battles.Presentation:The yummy muddy visuals of 2007 combined with♥♥♥♥♥♥poor character animation really date this game. There are some nice looking areas that do evoke a feeling of adventure like the coastal cliffs and fjords. The developers knew how to set the mood when entering legion infested areas by making those areas gloomy and dark. The animations just look bad, I was summoning a dragon and Skarin contorted and screamed for no reason. Also 30 fps cap and lagGame play:Ugh, repetitive, after the first island I grew quite tired of doing the simple combat and fighting the same enemies. Even the missions followed a similar formula. Combat is devolved into button mashing and blocking. Skarin himself is too slow and makes traveling around kind of annoying. There are very little tutorials to teach you how to play, seriously I didn't learn how to dodge until an hour in. The upgrades you get feel very minor and primarily come in the form of new moves that kind of help the monotony.Replay value:None. There are some collectibles (skulls) that net you nothing but an achievement.Overall:Not worth buying, there is little on offer here. If you want Viking fun, go play Rune. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite what critics have said about it - Viking is a fantastic game. The graphics are awesome, the controls are solid and mildy chunky but only as chunky and solid as you would expect - You ARE playing as a Viking afterall.. The sandbox you roam around in is huge and the game itself is instantlyplayable - there NO loading screens AT ALL when you are in the sandbox even if you die and respawn - no load screen. The complaints that there is slowdown is totally mistrewn the only slowdown you get is when trying to kill one of the Shamans and even then it is very minor and definitely not Game breaking. The quest/ game does get very repetitive such as clearing camps and saving other people to grow your army!			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												What to say., well you get what it says on the tin Graphics are pretty nice, get some very large scale battles, Where as expected you have a set target behind a mountain of mobs that only you can kill. So what do you do? Yep... LEEEE ROOOOYYYYY JEENNNKIIINSSS! *Dies*  * Respawns...*  Game has alot of running from A to B to free village from ""Orcs""?  Then from B back to A to be told to go find the next village. The combat system is very much hit, dodge, hit dodge, hit dodge,   there is a RTS element wher eyou can choose to ""nuke"" - Dragon power! certain targets during big battles,  Storyline is simple but it works. All in all I'd recomend it as part of a bundle but not worth purchasing on it's own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, this game is a piece of crapAlright, lets get into as to WHY it is a piece of crap:1. It barely works, its a clear cheaply done console port that came out in 2012.... 4 years after the console release...and it has only gone downhill in those years it seems.The game flat out tells you that you want to play it with a gamepad really and they are not kidding.Playing with the keyboard and mouse is painful and feels heavily like its just emulating the gamepad.But playing with a gamepad is not as easy as it looks, again, it often barely works, just look at the forums and people complaining about it.In my experience, the gamepad in the menu's cannot select anything, I have to alt-tab out OR shift-tab to the steam overlay to select anything, I have NEVER heard of such a thing in my life!Even worse, the menu ingame cannot be selected if you started the game up with this problem, the menu goes away as soon as you bring it up, as if you quickly tab the button twice.You would have to hope the auto-save does it work when that happens.Also in my experience, when the keyboard and mouse actually work, the controller does nothing at all....However I was lucky enough that the controller worked fine the last 4 times I started it up.Next to that, it also has massive performance issues, the main selling point of this game is the pretty big scale war where you are part of it in 3rd person, see it as an RTS but you are one of the soldiers.Sounds cool right? well yeah....in concept, the ♥♥♥♥ing game however slows down to a crawl, its hard to explain, it does not feel like playing with low framerate, its like playing the game in slow-motion which heavily limits control and...well...fun.2.GameplayYes, only now can I actually start talking about the damn game...should give you an indication.Ok so gameplay... well here are the main issues quickly summed up.You only have one set of weapons (sword and axe) throughout the entire game, for a simple hack and slash that is just a sin.No sword and shield, not big dual handed warhammer, nothing at all.Its incredibly boring doing the same stuff with the same weapons and really there is no excuse for it.There are only a handful of different enemies you fight throughout the entire game.There are also btw only a handful of models for the friendlies, just to indicate how half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and lazy this game is.You do the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ over and over and over again.I would call this modern day Ubisoft mechanics, where you do♥♥♥♥♥♥in some order in some area, move to the next area and do the same all over again.You do this 5 times and then the game is over.Hell even the endboss is the same giant you have been fighting for a while now.ConclussionLets wrap this up, this game sucks♥♥♥♥♥The biggest sin a piece of media can commit is being boring, and this game nails that.Its immensely repetative and it just feels half assesed everywhere, rushed.Even the story is all kinds of messed up and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing about it makes sense or explains anything.This game just completely SUCKS, do not get this pile of crap.

												In this freeroam Action Game with light Stealth Elements you are Skarin, a Viking resurrected by Freya to battle the undead legions of Hel on 3 Islands. You have to rescue your breathren in arms to build an army to reconquer the fallen cities of men.Pros:-Big and epic Battles-Big Maps which will take 4 to 5 hours to complete each-Vikings and Dragons against the undead (which is pretty metal)-Great Soundtrack-Varied Gameplay with Stealth, Platforming, Skirmishes and BattlesCons:-clunky fighting system-unprecise Map without zoom or free movement-stupid story with a horribly bad ending-barebone upgrade system-bad sound design (Players steps sound like hoofs for example, and awful sound mixing)-too much reliance on Quick Time Events (I hate tapping buttons just to open chests or use quicktravel)-battles aren't any form of challenge-awful boss battles-only 3 mapsThe problem with the showcase of the game, the big battles, is that you don't need any form of strategy or thinking for them. You just need to kill the enemy shamans who pull the undead constantly out of the underworld. If the shamans are killed, the next step in the battle starts. Your own soldiers also get resurrected by your shamans all the time. The soldiers are just there to clatter the battles so you can not advance easily. But you don't need to fight enemy soldiers at all, just the shamans. The whole thing is kinda pointless, and while the first two maps are at least a bit of fun the final one just sucks. I know this is an older game, but I was so disappointed when I finished it, I just had to write this review. Odin's Will this is not.			",540,139,11,52,45,4,84

												Currently stuck on the final stretch of the game thanks to a plethora of technical issues. This game is easily one of the worst ports I've played. KB+M support is exceptionally terrible, so a controller is 100% required. Next issue, the game is locked to 30fps. I was getting weird stuttering glitches from the outset, not frame drops per say, just completely freezing my screen while looping the same two frames. I have to tab out and in to fix this, and still don't know what causes it. It has slowly gotten more and more common as I progressed through the games 3 islands, it used to occur once every fight, now happens once every few seconds. I have tried verifying the game cache, to no avail. I am using Win10, running in Win7 compatability mode stops the stuttering issue, but seems to completely mess the frame rate randomly, crashing and freezing the game. Assets fail to load all the time currently, I can see through objects and enemies constantly disappear, leaving me swinging wildly into the air. If you're somehow still interested in the game after the wall of technical issues above, it is an uninspired hack and slash game. You travel to different points, usually to rescue fellow Viking clan members, and then mount an assault on the islands major stronghold. It gets repetitive, you are forced to use the broken stealth, and combat sucks. However, I found the gameplay somewhat enjoyable for some reason, partly because its so simple and mindless you can just zone out while playing. The big battles are a nice spectacle, but do nothing to fix the games issues, and you'll get tired of them after the first one. I'd probably recommend this game if you could bypass the technical issues, but sadly it seems that you cannot.Viking teeters on the edge of mediocrity, consistently dipping into below average territory. Because of this, I'd give it a 4/10. However, some god awful optimisation and bugs means the game deserves a 2/10.			",287,70,3,38,29,2,13

You will play it for a few hours but you will never finish it.Its a FPS slash-em-up set in a fantasy Midgard with RTS elements. You try and free captured vikings and destroy key points so that you can lead an assault on the next bad-guy strong hold. Defeat that and move on to the next part of the world.A few elements of shop buying and training (to learn combo moves) but it feels like you could just charge through it without them.

												Decent fantasy fighting game. With just a tiny bit more effort/money, this couldve been a fantastic action-adventure with lots of different fighting styles, exploration of three huge nordic isles and an ocassional clash of savage hordes where hundreds of AI controlled warriors fight an epic battle with you as their leader.Sady, this all just reads good on paper as designers and producers lacked a coherent vision.Viking delivers the promised features just barely:There are no real secrets to explore. Wandering around to find a hidden heap of gold behind a barn when there is little to buy is not that interesting. On the plus side, everything is easily reachable by foot, at least on the first two islands.The combat system is okayish - but has got very little depth.Our hero is similar to Ikea furniture: he's doing his job but I doubt there's much fanfiction for utter lack of personality.Gore is done half-arsed. After reaching mid-game, I had  hoped to find out how to skip the largely boring slo-mo executions. There's Quick Time Events, oh joy!The mass combat looks interesting at first but is garbage - basically the player is forced to ignore it as good he can.etc etc.If you're into vikings and the thought of slaughtering hundreds of undead baddies makes your inner berserk grin red, check it out.  All others, pass.Only 2,5 blooddrenched axes out of 5 hit a gut-smeared bullseye - Passable for fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just finished playing this game on win10. And seeing this game was published by Sega I expected a lot of bugs, but didn't really experience any. Exept for one. Going to the dragon's eye view the screen can go ""tilt"". Going to desktop and back into the game through alt-tab fixed it every time.Other then that this game was enjoyable even though it has many rough edges. You start in a small settlement and have to build up an army. The game was pretty lineair and walked you straight from point A to B in a logical and cleanly designed fashion. This makes the experience quite relaxing, but also predictable and repetitive. You go around freeing settlements and tied up vikings in order to increase your army. The culmination at the end of completing each map makes it all worth while however. As a reward for the grind you can see it was all worth something. The battles feel big and need some patience. You can see catapuls and summoned dragons in action. When you take over the city it is your turn to occupy and use it as the next forward base of operations. This too will show that your army and support from people is growing as your progress.Still the battles themselves are not challenging in the least and functions very roughly. Having to gather rage in order to perform combo's takes away the flow of battle at times. While in the combo you can't stop it and use a block/evasive action resulting in the occasion stunlock by opponents.It is a rough. mediocre game with some interesting ideas. People looking for a challenge won't find it here. The story is fairly standard. Still worth a try for a casual entertaining walktrhough. If you take your time this game is finished entirely in about 15hours of play.			",340,71,12,77,24,2,74

												One of the best action games I've ever played. The combat is like movie cinematics. The game actually knows when to slow down the action for dramatic effect in the middle of a fight. The enemy a.i. is very intelligent and can outsmart you pretty easily. I played on hard and the first difficult fight took me a few times to overcome, but once I got a hang of the combat dynamics it was definitely worth playing on a higher difficulty. Make sure to take time and talk to the NPCs as that really adds a lot more to the story element of the game. Very cool game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game, but it definitely has its problems.  The control scheme is frankly abyssmal (and a deal breaker for some), especially coupled with the badly designed QTEs (and i hate, hate, HATE-HATE QTEs); moves can be interrupted for random reasons (mine was for another enemy running in to help that wasn't with the initial group I was fighting as well as getting tripping up on a wall... go figure), and there isn't really a move/chained move cancel like in other games.  I would HIGHLY recommend using a controller (I went with my venerable xbox360 controller) for this as the keyboard and mouse controls added to the frustration.With that said, if you can deal with the movement, the rest of the game is pretty fun, especially with the whole viking theme and whatnot.  Getting upgrades is fairly easy and isn't some convoluted upgrade/evolution/whatever process like some games are fond of.  It's also quite fun rushing in with your swarm of warriors and utterly gutstomping the enemy, and lends a great deal of satisfaction to a lot of the more simple side-missions.

												Viking: Battle for Asgard is one of those games that is neither very bad nor very good. An action hack&slash game, with occasional massive battles. You can think it as a very premature Shadow of Mordor.I played the first map and a portion of the second map, and I enjoyed it so far. If you want to play an action game and chill, you can grab this one on a sale. Just don't have high expectations.			",182,48,1,29,8,0,15

Posted: September 13, 2016
												Viking: Battle for Asgard ist an Action Adventure with Hack 'n' Slash combat set in an open world in the viking age with fantasy elements. I won't say anything about the story or the characters since I was so bored by this game that I muted it and prefered to watch some videos or podcasts.I gonna start my review with the most said thing: This is a horrible port. It has everything YOU would not in a decent and optimised PC game: 30 FPS lock that results in stuttering and laggy gameplay, low FOV for a way too close camera, lack of essentail menu options like higher resolutions and clunky controlls both in combat and menu/map since its desinged for gamepad.Despite all these issues I played through the whole game, but it was very tiresome. The combat is so-so. The Hack and Slash is being freshened up by special moves, items and rune skills which either feel essential in order to kill some enemies (like the shieldbearers) and some do not seem to have any impact on your damage. One versus one battles are very easy (yes, even the final boss 1v1), while as soon as the count of enemies rises, you run into problems: When attacked you get stunned and if five enemies hit you, you either block or die, which results into very defensive combat at that point. The ""stealth"" part is ok, very limpsy since the FOV of your enemies is not consistent and sometimes you can eliminate a whole squad without being spotted, sometimes they spot you with their back through a wall.The good thing about the combat is the variety of the enemies, plenty of weak ones to mow down, some require a different approach, some should be focused first; then there are bigger ones which all are a bit challenging when combined with others.One thing that I hoped to be good are the big battles and oh boy, they look very impressive. Hundreds and thousand of enemies storming towards each other, clashing their weapons and you are fighting amongs your brothers-in-arms to reach the heart of the city. Sadly, your brothers are very stupid, you feel very weak since every enemy respawns and the only helpful thing you can do, is to storm alone through the enemy (since your army is just as stupid as theirs) and focus the onjective (mostly a shaman) and rushing it down. And when you are at the front, you feel alone and overwhelmed, since you are alone and 20 enemies are attacking you, leaving you to block and cry in a corner.The world is really nothing special, it has its moments but overall look boring, has very ugly textures and mapping and traversing it is even worse. Speaking of world, it has a lot for you to do, sadly it's always the same: either talk to an ally, free an ally or loot a chest after you have killed everyone near the point. The busy work lasted 10 hours for me and after half the game the repetitive work gets very dull.Speaking of repetitive, most of the interacting and some of the combat is tied to Quick Time Events. From finishing off a weakend giant and getting rid off of an assassin, over ripping open a cage to free your kin and opening a gate, to picking a lock and opening a chest, you have to smash your keys.The graphic is not the best, but acceptable.Overall, this game is way less than medicore, on the edge to horrible. Combat is repetitive, dull and boring, the busy work you get is just as repetitive and the PC port is an insult to this platform.Not worth the full price, not worth a dollar, would never play it again or tell anyone to who wants to have fun.

												Viking: Battle for Asgard is a hack and slash game with RPG elements. The hacking and slasing is very well executed and makes for a very addictive game. However, it's easy to get dissappointed in Viking if you go in with hopes for an open world RPG in the likes of Gothic or Elder Scrolls. The game is disguised as an RPG, but calling it one would be an insult on the genre. I am reluctant though to judge a game based on what it's not. Once you come to terms with what this game really is (a simple hack n' slasher), it's easier to cope with it.------Pros:------+ Open world.+ Great battle combos and killmoves.+ QTE slaying is very well done.+ Huge battles with hundreds of NPCs participating.+ Cool enemies, but I wish there were more different types of them.+ Stealthy approach supported.------Cons:------- The environment seems dull and empty. There are no amazing sights to see, no animals, nothing to gather, nowhere to climb, nothing to loot other than money, can't go into houses, many invisible walls, overall there's few to hold the lore together.- The human settlements often didn't even have living areas or had 1-2 for the whole settlement. There was no agriculture, the humans (99% were men) walked around in battle outfits, the settlements never had any distinctive elements that would make them different from each other etc.- Of course they had to add horns to viking helmets on enemies because noone knows that they first appeared in one of Wagner's musical plays in the 19th century.- Since it's a viking-themed game, you'd expect the environment to look something like Scandinavia...you know...since vikings came from there, but it looks nothing like Scandinavia, it's like the developers didn't even bother to google what their nature looked like.  - The weather effects look awful.- The protagonist looks like a big monkey in an outfit that looks asian/japanese origin.- Uninteresting story.- NPC's seem to move around aimlessly, it really stands out.- Character cannot swim.- You can't sprint and enemies move faster than you.- Outstandingly stupid AI.- God awful map/menu/minimap.- Only two difficulty levels, where Normal translates to Very Easy.--------Verdict:--------Despite all it's flaws, I enjoyed it. The things that were good, were very good. The things that were bad were connected to the game not being RPG enough. I just wish it had more lore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Vikings terrorised British shores over 1200 years ago, with the first raids recorded in the early 790’s. The Vikings raided England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales and they must have loved these shores as they kept coming back for more. The most recognisable invasion was the Norman Conquest in 1066 - some of you will remember this from History at school. I could go on giving you a lesson about the Vikings, but truth be told, this is about a particular Viking - Skarin, in Viking: Battle for Asgard.For centuries war has been bloody and relentless between the Underworld and Asgard. The Underworld, led by Hel, Queen of the Underworld, has her merciless soldiers who are known as the Legion, to destroy the realm of the Gods, Asgard. The reason for this is that Hel is looking for the God-killing weapon that can break the chains of Fenrir, Wolf God and brother to Hel. Legend believes that whoever breaks these chains starts Ragnarok; Fenrir will rise into the sky and swallow both the sun and moon, and most importantly creating a new age to be ruled by the person who initialises Ragnarok.With Hel’s reasoning for her war, Freya, Goddess of Light and Asgard, calls upon you to stop the evil Hel from initialising Ragnarok and calls upon you, Skarin, to battle Hel, Drakan (Hel’s Harbringer; as what Skarin is to Freya), and the Legion of the Underworld.Viking: Battle for Asgard is a very good free-roam hack-n-slash title. Its gameplay is addictive and easy to play. Basic controls, very good combinations of attacks and dragons make Viking: Battle for Asgard worth it. It executes what it set out to achieve - fun and addictive gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why did I get this?! That's the question I'm asking myself after forcing myself to finish it because I just wanted it done with. I thought it was going to be one of those cases of games that people say are crap but I will actually enjoy since I don't tend to critique games quite as much as other people but I was oh so wrong.Gameplay:It's tedious. The whole game is composed of 3 islands where you do the same thing:1.You run around the island rescuing captured settlements to recruit soldiers for your armies.2. Collect gold everywhere you can to buy upgrades for the 3 elemental powers you can imbue your weapons with (hint: just use ice, you freeze enemies and most go down in 2 hits with that)/ get potions and bombs/get new fighting moves (12 new moves in total)3. Get dragon stone pieces and take them to altar to get dragon for battle4. Big battle, lots of dudes (2-3 of these and you move on to the next island to do the same thing)While running around things are ok since the combat is mostly suited for smaller groups of enemies but the game had me raging in the big battles. You always have shamans that you have to kill in order to complete the battle. All troops respawn infinitely and your guys are dumb as bricks so if you don't take care of things personally nothing really happens. Once you actually get to the shamans you get surrounded by increasingly large numbers of enemies and they will attack you so often that you'll barely be able to do much besides defend or die and the catch is the shamans are invincible until you destroy 5 totems around them which take 3 hits each. The same idea is applied to the final bossfight which is such a major letdown that I can't even explain. Doing these things over and over again gets really annoying after a while.Graphics:Right of the bat this game wouldn't run smoothly on my rig and it should. Followed the advice of people on the forums and turned all of the 3 graphics options to low or off (which had almost no effect on how the game looks for the most part) and there was no improvement. When you're just running around things are fine mostly but when the big battles start it just slows down a lot making it extremely annoying to finish them..which is a major downside since those are supposed to be the best parts of the game.Sound:It has some. It is bad. The volumes of the different sounds are set horribly and there's nothing you can do about it.Story:You are a big burly viking about to die. Freya says: ""No! You work for me NAO! Go kill Hel!"". You kill a bunch of dudes...stuff happens...nothing interesting there. Ending cinematic made up of pictures which makes you feel like you did all that for nothing.

												I cannot recommend this game at all. I picked this up on a Steam Sale a couple of years ago, however, I've never been able to run it. I meet all the recommended requirements, but this game, for some reason, cannot go past 15fps on high settings, or 20fps on ""toaster"" settings. And, since the game speed is frozen to the fps rate, the game plays like a slowmotion video. Smooth, albeit extremely slow.I've contacted SEGA support, and they had me do everything, from updating the video drivers, to creating a new account on my computer (it was a Win 7 at that time) to try and play it, with no success. The support representative also asked me to change some settings that there weren't even there to begin with, and ended the support ticket asking me to ""post my issue on the forums"".From gameplay videos, I can see the game seems interesting, playable, and fun, but since it is unplayable at all, I can't recommend this to anyone.

												I never write reviews, but this must be the worst game I have ever played. The combat is 100% hack and slash. The missions are all repetative. I don't believe there is any point in rescuing any of the captured vikings that are not quest related. You can run past all of the creeps on the way to the Shaman (mini bosses for taking over a town). Pros:Graphics are pretty goodCons:The game itself. Content is bad. Understanding the story is impossible. I am a person who loves a good story line. Thoughout the entire game your screen goes red occasionally and you get a glimpse of a wolf I guess, but honestly I was lost, I love pretty much all video games. I have played them all from WoW to God of War to you name it. I hate this game  and I wish I never played it. I beat it and I can honestly say I wasted my time 100%.			",30,5,0,15,8,0,22

												This is the perfect example of game that lives up on screenshots and ""who does not like vikings"". It is like a checklist of things rather than a solid game. It lacks depth and soul and it is full of wtf moments. Do not even for a second think you can beat the game by your rules and skill, you can not. If you are not supposed to do something like the game wants, you will never do it. It is like a blend of good concepts that ended up being poorly implemented.Then there is the stealth element (yes, stealth). Probably one of the most horrible, absurd and poorly designed missions I have ever played. I wish I could throw this damn game to the sun.			",145,54,1,40,5,0,31

												Good game if you don't expect deep story or any story. Game consist of three islands, next one is always bigger then previous but objectives are still the same. Free camps, lumber mills, quarries, farms. so even for open world, game is still linear. I had minor performance issues with big battles but I have 2 years old mediocre laptop. But if you want to play game controller is big thing. Camera sensitivity for mouse is weird. Overall I had fun with the game.END GAME SPOILER :End game especially tower is very annoying, since there are constantly groups of 4 - 5 enemies, after beating five steps later another group will spawn. So when you finally meet the boss guess what...you will get locked yet another time with group of mobs. Finally after that you can kill boss mostly with quick time events aaaaand it is a game over.

												I can see a little bit of potential in Viking: Battle for Asgard. Although I felt there are a number of things wrong with this game that brought it down into the “not recommended” category. The story, from what I can gather, is that you’re a Viking brought back to fight a Legion army and eventually destroy a woman named Hel. You battle across 4 islands (You re-visit one of them so it’s really only 3 distinct locations) On each island you must raise an army large enough to take over the stronghold, find a rune to summon a dragon and upgrade your weapon. Every island has the same basic objectives and it’s very repetitive. With such vast open areas you think there would be more scenarios, but it’s the same formula 4 times in a row. The gameplay itself is average to below average. The fighting system is clunky which becomes very apparent when you are fighting multiple enemies at once. You end up having to push everyone away from you to separate them out in order to hit them. Otherwise, the surrounding enemies will hit you during your attacks, causing you to be stunned. You are forced to take on a defensive strategy. The extremely narrow FOV also handicaps you as attacks will come blindly.There is a very basic upgrade system of buying new moves and power-ups. There are not any character stats, just collecting gold to buy these things. The extra moves and combos were useful, but I found myself only using the lighting, fire and ice special attacks barely a handful of times during the game. The levels are large but mostly empty. There are a number of fast travel locations in each map, which helps but you’re still required to run around the map discovering them first. Your characters running speed is far too slow for these big distances. The graphics are acceptable and the environment can look quite good. Maybe it was just my game, but I had no in-game music except for the big battles. So most of the time I was listening to my own footsteps. The large battles seem to be the “best” part of the game, but even this is lacking. The battles are great visually. It was awesome to see my large army charging toward the enemy. Ultimately, you are forced to battle on your own to kill Shamans and giants. Thus making the large scale battle seem unnecessary as you and your enemies respawn continually. Pros+Decent graphics+Large scale battles look cool+Large maps (albeit empty)+Environment+Good set of moves to learnCons+30fps+Clunky combat system +Repetitive gameplay+QTE (quick time events) used excessively +World map lacks zoom or free movement+Narrow FOV+Character run speed too slow+Stealth sections+Voice acting+Small enemy variety This isn’t a game I’d recommend to friends. However, if you’re really into Vikings and hack and slashes, you may want to give this game a try if there is a good sale. 4/10 Below average			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My fine review of this fine expensive game.Do buy this game! its so worth you´re time.with all the qualitys it has. The repetetive enemies, the bosses you wont even notice, and the running, and dying is so much fun. Now dont forget all the customization abilities you have in this game. Where you can pick between either... well.. ehm.. it sorta doesnt have any. Well you can choose your attacks. Either the first button or the second.Scroll down for a pro and cons.- Pros -Decent blood and gore...Thats about it...- Cons - Typical hack and slash game. (For all means THIS IS NOT AN RPG.)Really repetative. (You move from one place to kill minions, to the next place to kill some more, and so on. Until the game is over.)Bosses doesn´t really behave like bosses should. (Bosses in this game is just a little bit stronger and thougher than the normal enemies. You will even barely notice they´re bosses at all.)The storyline is as interesting as a sidequest in wow. (And as well made. The text you´re reading is so thrilling   ""sarcasm"")Graphics are outdated but decent and acceptable.You dont really progress your character either. You buy all the spells in the start. Then as you earn more money you buy some new skills and thats more or less it. (You can´t buy anything else than spells, skills, and health potions)This is also a running simulator by the way. Nice huh!No exploring. the only thing you do is kill the same sort of enemies again and again and again.  Did i forgot to mention that the only thing you do is run to one spot to another spot, to another spot, to kill some well known enemies.If someone have read all the way down here. And still thinks about buying this game, DONT!It´s nowhere worth the money. Even if it was for free i wouldn´t buy it. Hope my hatred towards this game have helped some poor soul into rethinking their purchase of this game.			",121,25,2,19,14,2,16

												Basically a knock off of Skyrim or any other open world game with side-quests. It's not really all that fun or engaging and does not require any skill to be good. There is almost no character growth as you progress. I say almost because you can use the money you find to purchase new attacks, but the different attacks add nothing but possibly a cool(ish) looking kill move. I do not recommend this game.

												Don't bother. Even at discount prices this game doesn't justify purchase. Sadly despite having a viking setting and making an attempt to introduce multiple generes - whereby you engage in first person action to build a force for larger scale combat - it never delivers. While the lack of interesting plot or character development can be forgiven there is nothing to compensate for it's absence. Third person action feels heavy, the character upgrades make no percievable difference, large scale combat involves minimal strategy, and areas, while pretty for the price point, become repetitive. It would be easy to blame these issues on the game being a poor console port but the reality is that I can't see how this would have been anything except faster with a gamepad in hand. If you really have to collect achievments or mindlessly slaughter your way through a limited number of respawning enemy types then try warhammer 40,000 space marine as an alternative, the movement is far superior and the environments more varied.

												No effort at all was made to redesign this game as a pc game. They ""reccomend a 'gamepad' to play"" meaning that if you don't use one the controls are clunky and unintuitive. Even if you were to use a controller, the character handless like a drunk elephant in space balancing on its hind legs. Then there's the gameplay. There is no effort made to show you where you're going or what you're supposed to be doing. I played for about an hour, and after lowering the graphics quality to it's lowest settings so that I could play without lag, the most combat I saw was against a large pot. The only one in town. I played for 50 minutes as a glorified big, burly, apparently immortal, viking messenger boy, who walks like an astronaut. I found gold around town, played a button mash minigame to ""untie"" soldiers to ""join my army"" (only one button), and bought runes to add elemental effects to my weapons. Which I came to learn were complex to cast spells. IN SHORT: *Poorly designed.*NO effort was made to optimize it as a pc game.There's someone to play every game, so if you enjoy this, go right ahead. I don't reccomend it though.			",273,77,7,58,41,0,33

												Although I haven't played much of Viking: Battle for Asgard, I have to say it's a bit more disappointing than I anticipated. Sure, it's a fun hack and slash game based off of Viking mythology (although I don't think Hel ever tried to invade Midgard) with fun ways to kill your enemies, but it gets... Old. And the frame rate and character design isn't the greatest in the world (minus some of the monsters you kill. Kinda remind me of the draugar (that's plural for draugr, by the way) from Skyrim). The controls are hard to get used to (hell, this is a console game). From what I've heard and seen, there are some RTS strategies and you get to fight dragons, giants, and a whole bunch of other baddies, so there are some redeeming factors.However, that's not enought to save this game from being a ""game-to-pass-the-time-with"" thing. So, if you're looking for a game with a gripping story with a bunch of drama, I wouldn't recommend this (or Skyrim. Skyrim has the gripping story but no drama thankfully). But, if you're looking for a fun way to pass the time while getting rid of your bloodlust, I'd say give it a shot. It's not the greatest, but it's entertaining when taken in small amounts.

												MEDIOCRE!Ok, now that thats out of the way, this game isn't necessarily bad. If you have a huge backlog of great games, theres no real reason to waste time on this one. It takes elements from a lot of popular games and shoves em all into one pretty unspectacular title. The combat is like a watered down God of War. You will be able to unlock new combos and upgrade 3 basic spells, but none of them are particularly satisfying to use. Honestly, you can beat the whole game by just block-parrying all the enemies. Also the game has a wierd combat mechanic where you can press a quicktime button (expect a lot of quicktime events for all boss fights) to execute a weakened enemy. The problem with this is that if you don't execute the enemy, he will just die automatically after a few seconds. It is fun to see the gory executions, but it gets old real fast. It is also possible to stealth kill enemies if you sneak up on them behind.There are some basic platforming ""puzzles"" in some dungeon areas. They aren't really puzzles though. Theyre pretty straightforward things like climbing net ladders, shimmying across narrow walls, tiptoe walking over planks, and jumping across gaps.There are 3 acts to this game, each putting you on a large map where you will have to explore to complete quests. I gotta say though, the acts are VERY similar to each other. The only difference is that the maps are different. I took a break of months between each act so that it wouldn't feel so repetitive. The story is lame, as is the dialogue, music, and sound effects. The good this is that you can just skip it all. This isn't exactly a bad game, it's just very mediocre. I played it through to the end eventually because it is good to play if you just want a mindless rpg where you don't have to pay attention to anything.			",632,132,18,87,35,3,106

												My fine review of this fine expensive game.Do buy this game! its so worth you´re time.with all the qualitys it has. The repetetive enemies, the bosses you wont even notice, and the running, and dying is so much fun. Now dont forget all the customization abilities you have in this game. Where you can pick between either... well.. ehm.. it sorta doesnt have any. Well you can choose your attacks. Either the first button or the second.Scroll down for a pro and cons.- Pros -Decent blood and gore...Thats about it...- Cons - Typical hack and slash game. (For all means THIS IS NOT AN RPG.)Really repetative. (You move from one place to kill minions, to the next place to kill some more, and so on. Until the game is over.)Bosses doesn´t really behave like bosses should. (Bosses in this game is just a little bit stronger and thougher than the normal enemies. You will even barely notice they´re bosses at all.)The storyline is as interesting as a sidequest in wow. (And as well made. The text you´re reading is so thrilling   ""sarcasm"")Graphics are outdated but decent and acceptable.You dont really progress your character either. You buy all the spells in the start. Then as you earn more money you buy some new skills and thats more or less it. (You can´t buy anything else than spells, skills, and health potions)This is also a running simulator by the way. Nice huh!No exploring. the only thing you do is kill the same sort of enemies again and again and again.  Did i forgot to mention that the only thing you do is run to one spot to another spot, to another spot, to kill some well known enemies.If someone have read all the way down here. And still thinks about buying this game, DONT!It´s nowhere worth the money. Even if it was for free i wouldn´t buy it. Hope my hatred towards this game have helped some poor soul into rethinking their purchase of this game.			",121,25,2,19,14,2,16

												Where to start... where to start... hm... there is simply too much wrong with this game to cover it all.... just don't buy this game, if you get it in a Total War collection, it should be alrightish, but if you buy this game by itself... why don't you just go and donate all that money to whatever instead, it is easier, quicker and you save yourself from a lot of dissapointments, raging, frustrations and some self torture. Quicktime events, auto aiming that don't work correctly, button mashing, items sometimes desiding that you just used them all, and i mean all 10 axes, 3 fire bombs and all your health items, all at once, without you ever using them, and least but definatly not last, unresponsive controls... is just some of the problems this game has happening all the time.... also, the story is... well... almost as good as BF3's single player story.... nuff said...

												A horrible game. I'm surprised that I played as long as I did, though I suspect that it was becaused I hoped to find some reason to like the game, but I found none.I bought it for 3 euroes and it was not even worth it at that price, so I would definitely not recommend buying this game for 13 euroes. It's a massive waste of money and the whole game itself is a steaming pile of crap. The only redeeming aspect is the combat, which can only be described as ""good"" and is hardly a reason to purchase this game. For a 2012 game the graphics are horrible in comparison to other games of that time. The controls are poor. The voice acting and main story are both very generic and lack spirit. Buying this game is a waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very shoddy port. First off, you think since it has been 4 years since the game was first released they could have gotten it right? The game seems to run super slow. You character just slowly jogs and there is no way to run. His attacks seem to start out slow, then just jerkily happen all of a sudden. The finishing moves seems to slow the game down too. The whole game feels as if it is being done in slow motion. There are no new weapons and nothing really to get or upgrade besides a few moves. The story is barren. There is only one directional dodge. Even if you run out of range of an enemy attack they usually just get to attack and it teleports them to you so there is no intuitive way to dodge attacks. This is especially annoying when you want to run from a fight because you are outnumbered, since every enemy gets instant long range on you and you get killed every time trying to run. The fighting plays out in slow motion too for some reason. Must be a graphics problem even though mine were on medium. You also have to run config from the folder and can't make control or graphics options in game. There are only a few repetitive attacks you can do. I have no clue why people compare this to god of war because the game is nothing like it. The gameplay is every similar. You must go around freeing people and liberating areas before a big battle for each area. Needs more variety in what you are doing. The platforming is also poorly done. You have no idea what you can climb and movements seem ugly and jerky. It is also done in slow motion due to game problems. The special kills are cool but take too long and you get sick of them after the first hour and they take too long. Especially since just a regular attack kills them at that point it seems senseless to use the attack that takes forevery to show. This is also done in super-slow-mo because of the game problem and because the game slows down. 5.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy it! It has the FPS limited on 30. Beside that, even with TOP hardware you can not even play with MAX settings. You can search for ""Viking Battle for Asgard Lag"" or ""Viking Batte for Asgard FPS"" and you'll see the bad reviews for yourself. Simple example, I can perfectly play Crysis 2 with Ultra Settings, but can't play this game in 1920x1080 with LOW SETTINGS! Everything looks like in slow motion.!POOR CONSOLE PORT! (you can google it too)I also read some reviews of players who were complaining about the keyboard. So even if you (somehow) can play the game, you'll find another problem.I truly regret of buying this game. At least it was in promotion! LOL T_T			",92,8,15,10,13,0,7

I did not expect hand holding, but consistently become stuck because i cannot perform what i assume to be incredibly basic functions of the game, even after pressing every key combination possible, which you cannot view within game btw, only as an xbox controller pre game launch.graphics are very basic and gameplay repetitive.  even at only minutes into this game the gameplay is repetitive and bland.  story is based on dragons and mythical gods and lacks any imagination, its been done 100000000 times before.  i got this game for free in a bundle and would still not recommend it on the your time it takes to download.

They could not be arsed to even port the control menu into the game it has to be done pre launch, same with the graphics options (that are by default set to widescreen. If you dare to continue past that your expirence won't improve much the voice acting is bland at best and in the little time I wasted the most interesting part was collecting sacks of gold.This isn't just a bad port from the little I've played its a poor game, I played Spartan: Total war a long time back and while that had a lot to desire this game is a step down from that and the port makes it even worse, I only own as thrown in as part of a bundle and I still feel swindled by its presence.

												I only paid about $2 for this on sale, so I can't say I didn't get my money's worth, but I can't say I was impressed with this game, even given my low expectations going in. The combat is fun -- brutal and visceral -- but it's also quite repetitive, there's no story to speak of, and the stealth sections feel forced and are not at all fun. I very rarely will give up on a game without finishing it, but I did with this one.It's not completely terrible, and you can get a few hours of halfway decent entertainment from it, but on the whole, I wouldn't recommend it.

Have come to the conclusion, that the game is such a bad, bad port, not even worth installing. The mouse feels so awkward, no matter the sensitivity, makes the game unplayable. I rarely got such issues with a game and that means just one thing, it's a bad port, and there is nothing we can do, so I just got rid of it. I'm pretty sure I will never again try to play this game.			",253,25,35,6,3,0,11

												I just wanted to write a quick review whaen I saw the sale. This is a great little button masher hack n' slash, with a great artstyle and semi-engaging story. Best played with a controller. Creative Assembly came out of their comfort zone for this one, and usually devs stumble when attempting this, but even with a small budget they managed to pull off a quality game here. I am beginning to respect Sega alot as a publisher with risk taking in the PC market in the last decade. It's good to see a major publisher taking the PC market seriously on a consistent basis, and not just when it's easy to port something over.			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												Terrible console port.  I did not expect hand holding, but consistently become stuck because i cannot perform what i assume to be incredibly basic functions of the game, even after pressing every key combination possible, which you cannot view within game btw, only as an xbox controller pre game launch.graphics are very basic and gameplay repetitive.  even at only minutes into this game the gameplay is repetitive and bland.  story is based on dragons and mythical gods and lacks any imagination, its been done 100000000 times before.  i got this game for free in a bundle and would still not recommend it on the your time it takes to download.

												This game is a joke and a bad one at that. They could not be arsed to even port the control menu into the game it has to be done pre launch, same with the graphics options (that are by default set to widescreen. If you dare to continue past that your expirence won't improve much the voice acting is bland at best and in the little time I wasted the most interesting part was collecting sacks of gold.This isn't just a bad port from the little I've played its a poor game, I played Spartan: Total war a long time back and while that had a lot to desire this game is a step down from that and the port makes it even worse, I only own as thrown in as part of a bundle and I still feel swindled by its presence.

												The only good thing I can say about this game is that it has Vikings in it. I am amazed at how bad a game this is; it had such a good idea Vikings+openworld third person action game+big battles  where you get to see all the vikings you've rescued fight. That last one sounds epic right! Well it's not. CA seems to have missed the whole point of open world games, Seeing them change around you based on the objectives you acomplish! For example Infamous, in Infamous when you clear a block from the anarchists you actually see citizens patrolling the streets and having fights with anarchists who try to cause trouble. In this game it just changes from rainy to sunny... Your army is always the same size in the actual battles. The graphics are also terrible looks like this game is from 2004, and good luck gettting more than 25 frames in battles.. All in all Terrible port for a bad game. Easily the worst game Creative Assembly has ever made.			",255,20,2,31,10,1,25

												30 FPS dont bother, unless headaches are a must have feature.  And I love the clueless that make the 30FPS is all your eyes can see argument.  They are right!!!! But only if you never move your mouse around to look then of course and obviously they are dead wrong.  The speed at which you turn your mouse determines how FPS effects game play, move your mouse or turn very very very slowly then yes its fine, no blurring.  Move your mouse fast then its a slide show.  Not sure why this is hard for people to understand.  FPS rates are directly related to how fast you move your mouse its not based on staring at a monitor and not moving.			",263,19,0,38,4,0,5

												Got this game for free.  For some reason Sega decided to hand out a bunch of really poorly ported console games and this was no exception.Basically a God of War clone except your super powers are really unimpressive and the plot is completely unimportant.  You just (very slowly) running from small town to town in order to liberate people after killing what feels like the same mob over and over.  Every QTE is either mashing F or doing the same three key input that prompts well before the results take place on screen.  The army v army raids would be great if both sides didn't have endless respawning troops and if you could maybe tinker with the graphics settings in order to manage 200 units on screen at once.It's a cool game if you want some quick achievements but that's honestly not worth the dollar that this should sell for.  Don't buy this.			",101,12,1,6,7,0,5

Плюсы - это грандиозные битвы за земли викингов, в лучших традициях Total War, с поправкой на то, что мы управляем одним бойцом из целой армии; обширные локации; сама тема викингов; МОРЕ, МОООРЕЕЕ кровищи и кишок!

												This is a surprisingly solid game!  I think with it being older and on sale, I wasn't sure what to expect for gameplay, but I was consistently surprised by this game.  It's good, graphically, with some nice effects and a remarkable number of on-screen characters during sieges.  The combat system is deeper than I expected, and I only felt like one of the moves you can learn was superfluous.The only real drawback is that the voice acting is awful.  Fortunately, you don't have to interact with NPCs too often, so it's not a deal breaker.			",141,73,1,18,26,1,25

												I don't often write reviews for games, this one I feel like I need to warn other people before they waste their time and money on this game. This is a horrible PC port of a console game and if you look at the steam forums from 2012 you will see that there are massive control issues for this product. I personally have a wired X-Box 360 controller and the game simply does not recognize it. There are no options to change the input at all, no way to bind the controller to the virutal X-box 360 controller in the setup, nothing. It didn't even have a natural selection for my monitor 1680x1050 in the resolution section of the game. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this title. I got it as part of the Humble Bundle from Creative Asembly so I don't feel too cheated but I was looking forward to the game as anything with vikings in it is a sell for me! None of the user created x-box controller fixes seem to exist any more and none of the devs feable attempts to fix the issue have done myself or many others any good.			",223,36,4,43,29,1,28

												It's a no brainer slash'em up, with limited, rehashed character designs, and a bland story line.With that being said if you want something that's halfway decent to kill time, with a bonus godly narrator, it might be worth buying it while it's on sale. I wish there was a ""soort of?"" recommendation, because after finishing the game it has become a guilty pleasure. It's bad, but can be fun.			",97,50,1,24,16,0,13

												I don't often write reviews for games, this one I feel like I need to warn other people before they waste their time and money on this game. This is a horrible PC port of a console game and if you look at the steam forums from 2012 you will see that there are massive control issues for this product. I personally have a wired X-Box 360 controller and the game simply does not recognize it. There are no options to change the input at all, no way to bind the controller to the virutal X-box 360 controller in the setup, nothing. It didn't even have a natural selection for my monitor 1680x1050 in the resolution section of the game. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this title. I got it as part of the Humble Bundle from Creative Asembly so I don't feel too cheated but I was looking forward to the game as anything with vikings in it is a sell for me! None of the user created x-box controller fixes seem to exist any more and none of the devs feable attempts to fix the issue have done myself or many others any good.			",223,36,4,43,29,1,28

												You are a Viking of Asgard, not just any old Viking at that. You are Skarin who falls in battle and gets given another chance by the gods, but at a price.With your new life the gods have given you they have charged you with the task of ending the war against heaven and hell. This is not an easy task and you must gain aid and trust from other Viking to rebuild the army to fight against Hell.This is a very action based hack n' slash. Great visuals, cut scences and voice overs.The only issue is that the controls can feel clumsy, I choose to stick with keyboard and mouse but it is 360 controller compatable.A great over all game with a brilliant story line to boot.

												I have not played this game very long but it will probably remain so. In the game it seems there is no customization, no armor, no weapons, nothing. You use a sword and an axe and all you can change on that are 3 runes in there. You can by attack moves/combos but thats pretty lame if you ask me. Also, the game doesnt even run well, has horrible controls and settings to change them, the interface is realllllly bad as well. I like these types of games but this one was done very badly. I get it came out years ago, but still. Even back then its not done very well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So this is Legend of Viking: A Chain-Link To The Past.If you remember Spartan: Total Warrior and Ocarina of Time, you get the idea. There are a few differences, of course, but a lot of those differences come in the form of 'axes' and 'different reasons magic is happening.' Also your magical instrument doesn't cause weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to happen, except perhaps the summoning of a bunch of 'vikings.'Never mind that the main character is the most viking thing about this game. I mean look at him, tattoos on his tattoos, he has a two handed sword and just because he felt he was a little light on hardware, he decided he should bring about sixy axes too. He's so metal he basically doesn't wear clothes and lets everyone else do all the talking between piles of gore. Or he would, if he wasn't dead all the time.Hilariously enough, unlike those previously mentioned games, he also suffers for not wearing armor and can't take on all the problems himself, 'cause the numerous enemies he has to deal with can wiffle bat him to death. This is assuming everything works out fine and you either A. Have a controller (hopefully xbawx) or B. Have tarantulas for hands so that you can work the♥♥♥♥♥backwards default keybindings. It's somewhere between the average VCR and Dark Souls in user friendliness. So how does the game get around this?Well, when there's more than 3-5 enemies, the game usually has you summon a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of vikings. Thanks to the well known norse power of 'friendly fire off' you can wade into similarly colored and shaped friend and enemy alike mashing the attack button and magnetically snap to the bad guys to kill them a lot. You also have magical powers that do things like set every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around you on fire, which is a fairly significant force multiplier.Okay, enough being a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this: my biggest question about this game is just an endless series of 'why's.Like, why do I have to summon an army? Am I not cool enough to just kill everything on my own like, say, anyone in a character action game in the last 10 years? Or ♥♥♥♥, a game that is actually designed fairly similarly, Dynasty Warriors? Like, what could I possibly be contributing to a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off vikings that outnumber whomever we're going up against? Other than, say, fighting the kinds of antagonists that give those vikings trouble... So... Why am I fighting in the main battle when I can just kill those? It seems like the kind of thing that looked okay written on paper. I mean really, the battles may as well be a cinematic if there's not some big road block (which there haven't been any thus far) because I can literally just stand there and watch them fight for me. There are no commands to give, so far as I can tell, and nothing changes about the combat interface when a big battle happens, so, weirdly enough I fell kind of extraneous.Or, the F button, ohmigod the ♥♥♥♥ing F button.Okay, so what makes me need to mash it to get a door open? Or throw a switch? Or open a chest? Or open another door? Why is it that when my finger lets off the ♥♥♥♥ing button that the character goes through a failure animation that's actually longer than the success animation? Do you honestly think I need to be engagued for opening every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ door, that my interaction with this thing needs to be highlighted by adding to the entropy to my keyboard? 90% of games nowadays are okay with making that a single button press. And, oh yeah, this game also automates climbing up smaller ledges, so why not just automate opening♥♥♥♥♥♥too? I mean am I really going to go near something like that and not take care of it?The plot, thus far, could also have been written by people who read that 'tarantulas for hands' sentence earlier and got really excited, and really just raises a whole bunch of questions: If Freya is okay with throwing Hel's legions out of the starting 'Viking-Town' with a magical hand wave and saving us from certain death, why doesn't she just hand wave away all the other dead vikings? Or the whole Hel invasion thing? Also, we have teleporter runes that take us place to place, and I have seen other vikings using this, without me 'unlocking' them, so why on earth are invasions restricted by land at all? They don't seem to guard the oft referred to in norse myth teleporter rocks so why not just stand in our literal stone circle and get the vikings a viking on everybody's doorstep? Rather than 'battle for asgard' this game should have just had the subtitle 'Don't ♥♥♥♥ing think about it' 'cause that seems like the only way any of this makes sense. I mean, thanks for the free game Sega, but really, why?TLDR: If you like dynasty warriors, play dynasty warriors, if you like total war, play total war, trying to smash both together doesn't work super well.

												Well, what to say about ""Viking: Battle for Agard""?If you want a definition of a console hack'n slash, it is this game. No story, no deep gameplay, no remarkable characters, no immersion. This game is VERY repetitve, you do EXACTLY the same on every island, even the towers you have to liberate get recycled.Game is utterly polished though, with nice to look at fortresses inspired by  Lord of the Rings. The controls arent as bad as some people are arguing, I played MUCH WORSE games.Probably the devs wanted to create a game that fulfills the standards in every aspect, and the result was a game that is mediocre in every aspect.If you like Vikings AND hack'n slash AND casual (not ""or""), get this game on sale.

The stupid zombie guys are really easy to beat, and the only challenge was when you fought the armies of them. The sucky inbetween animations take a while, too. Overall, it's just not worth it.

												It's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game from a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥studio, the 1st third of the game was kinda enjoyable but the rest was exactly the same only with a different enviorment. Camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the most cruical of moments and the gamepad controls are finger breaking and the button response is more than lame. The story is obvious and leaves no suprises.All in all its a game you are happy to never play again after completing it, there is no replay value whatsoever. IF you want to torture yourself and complete it that is.I can only recommend it to fans of the viking era and norse gods, even though both aspects are only for show and extremely shallow. The viking feeling in this game is more dead than alive, it could have been any kind of warrior like culture.tl;drBad : -controls ; sound / music ; shallow story and storytelling ; repetitive gameplayGood : simple yet effective strealth system ; ... vikings I guessDon't do this ever again SEGA, just don't.

												Viking is a good game, the game is more or less open world is a bit linear but the combat on trying to take castles and siege is very cool. Its not long in the sense that when you start to become boring the game ends. The scenario is very good when you accostumate to it. The game has the problem of 30 fps caps which makes it a little unconfortable. However, if you are going to grab this on a bundle it will be very enjoyable!			",388,143,12,75,22,3,45

												Vikings is not a sophisticated game; it's ""God of War"" minus the enthralling setting and characters. But it is satisfying, gory combat and that makes up for many of its flaws. Easy to pick up (a gamepad is highly recommended), it lacks variety in enemies, upgrades and locales but is otherwise passable entertainment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, this recommendation is biased because of the fact that I've played and completed this game on ps3 and Xbox 360, loving every minute of the thing, however that doesn't mean it's perfect by any stretch of the imagination, the Frame rate blows, it's god-awful but this was a problem with all versions of the game, it just wasn't well-optimised at all, also, the keyboard configuration is god-awful, not even worth attempting, use your console controller, otherwise you aren't going to have a fun time but be warned that, at least for me my right stick (camera) is reversed as in right is up, down is left totally bizzare, don;t know is that affects anyone else or if it's just me but that is a warning. However those are really the only massive down-fall the game has, the combat is tough and skillfull, not unfair mind you. The animations of characters; specifically Skarin; the protagonist moves and plays beautifully, even the platforming parts of the game are well-done and a joy to play as it's all animated greatly and implimented skillfully. But to be honest, the best part of Viking is the all-out wars that are featured within the game, and there's alot! And surprisingly, the game doesn't tank then, where at least at some points 1000's of characters are shown on screen. This game is great ofr those looking for a hack and slash experience and don't want a story bugging you along the way and this is one of the only games that I can name that let you wage war and personally let you get involved in them. I give Viking a 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												whilst there is quite a bit of detail in the blood/gore department, the gameplay itself is very very repetitive, gets boring after around 3-4 hours of doing the same thing over and over (find bad guy camp, kill everything, save warriors for big battle, repeat until final big battle, next area).the combat itself takes some time and practise to get used to since it is very outdated and stiff (evading is useless against the bigger champion bosses) but feels pretty cool once you get the hang of things - it feels good chaining attacks and decapitating like 5 guys without geting hit once.i could care less for the narrative, since most brawler style games have a paper thin narrative used ot get players from point Ato B, so i cant really comment there, besides it being very generic (save the day chosen one).visually the game is decent, with the protagonists character model reminding me of conan the barbarian (arnie from the 80's movie). the visuals reminded me of fable... must have been the glow on things that washes the colours out... i odnt know, but i guess they where both very pretty games at their time of release (both games have aged nicely as well).sound is hit or miss - the sound of a sword or battle axe crunching through an emeies spin is very satisfying, but there is little else in the sound department (aside from annoying effect noises, like walking in puddles or climbing ropes).overall i would give the game a 6.5/10 b/c whilst is had a cool concept (gathering an army for large scale battles), it became boring and repetitive very quickly. i would recommened purchasing this if it's on special (i got it for $5 so i'm not really complaining), otherwise skip it.P.S the AI in large battles is as dynamic as the AI in the dynasty warrior games, so dont expect cool and epic wars, since you will be doing most of the decapitating (if not all).

												It reminds me a lot about Fable. Overall its a linear game play, no real story but fun battles. It was entertaining and played very well. There is a bug on second island with a mission but it doesn't cause any problem with progression. Overall I like it and it was a good 10 hour waster of fun.

I first played this on ps3, but I stoped platforms and went PC all the way. I was well pleased to see Viking:BFA on steam for $5. Well worth $10 Imo. Fighting is fun but a little complicated at times. It's one of those games you got to keep grinding untill you finish. Not lay it down ""oh i will come back to it"" because the learning of timing of buttons to press makes a none muscle memory game. The screen filling up with the mob you release and battle your way through hoards of enemies was a blast. A solid 7/10. Check it out pssst Get it for $5 on a sale ;) GAME ON!!!			",112,6,0,18,4,0,2

												I thought this game was ok, a lot like Dynasty Warriors.  Played for about 3 hours and liked the mechanics.  The frame rate was really slow during the huge battles but it was fine during the smaller quest fights.			",690,166,20,105,63,13,133

												One of my all time favorites, if for atmosphere alone. Gameplay is solid, though the camera can be a worthy opponent. Reminds me of a single player World of Warcraft, or a darker, Norse styled Fable. There's a little bit of everything here, and it's as beautiful to look at as it is fun to play.

												I can say this game would be worth it if you can buy it on sale. I got it as part pf the total war master collection. Its ok so far as game play , but learning the awkward key mapping is a bit tedious. My biggest complaint so far is that all the NCPS look exactly the same. Its like living in a world of clones.

												bought that game for ps3 a long time ago. After playing the game through on steam I still can't remember if I played it through before.I liked this game in some way because of the setting which is not used over and over again but the last few hours I just wanted to finish this game because it was too much of the same. This game needs a ♥♥♥♥ing run-button. I killed myself a million times, because it was much fast to travel than walking.Just look on youtube for a gameplay-video if you are interested in this game and only buy it for max 5€. Today there are too many things that will ♥♥♥♥ you up.			",873,335,46,107,146,16,125

My brains where bleading in agony from slow moving, lag and screen tering of this game. Sega did not invest time to code this game for 60 fps when they put it on PC and thats yust plain stupid.

												I would like the game, if it were not for technical problems which make it so annoying that I uninstalled it. :(Pro:   + good atmosphere   + good grpahics   + interesting settingCon:   - Everytime I start the game, it resets all options. Very annyoing, because I forget about this, so I have to quit, set it back, and restart. There is no way to adjust graphics setting ingame. :(   - The game runs like in slow motion most of the time. Poor performance, even though I have a high end system , and already reduced the graphics setting. While I'm in a village with lots of KI, it feels like wading through a swamp.   - Everytime I start the game, it reinstalls some library. Seems it also forgets about this.   - Fighting is a bit boring, as you just have to press the same two buttons again and again.I would recommend it, if the problems with performance and options would be improved.

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't and there are few reasons for it.- Game is for consoles and controllers, You can play with keyboard but You will feel that it's for console. (I was playing with mouse and keyboard)- As You play game that has been made for consoles, You need to play the way consoles make games.  (believe me, it's not &*&* talking, all console games have some tricks and etc)- Where this game is Hack and Slash, I find other games more exciting, and rewarding, than this one... :(- I was playing only 40 minutes, and I did die 2 times, and I made all villages around me except the last one, that seems to be too hard for me.- I learned few skills, and there were like 6 to learn, but I couldn't understand one of them how to make.- There is a map, teleports and etc, and that is ok.- There are no quests whatsoever, and Your inventory has like 6 slots?- There is no drop, but it doesn't have to be in Hack and Slash game.- Graphics like from Witcher 2, or Witcher 1, So still ok, but not many decals.Overall... 4/10? Didn't make me want to play it more. Sorry.			",520,289,18,68,62,6,67

												Minimum 75% off sale - recommended.This game has a similar feel to brutal legends or gothic 3 (lite) in that for the most part one travels the map as an individual protaganist freeing locations so that every so often a grand battle can be had. With a check point system there's infinite respawn making it a very casual game but also tedious as everything is reset until an area is completed in one run through. There are aspects of rpg... collect cash to unlock new moves, increase special powers and health but its all very superficial and lite and actually gives the game a reverse difficulty curve as no new enemy are introduced after the second island. There is also an inventory of sorts - 3 consumables, 3 powers and a repeatable passive buff.The game isn't really open world but more 3 large islands with progression related restrictions in place making each island effectively 2 parts. Quests/missions are either kill everything here (primary), kill everything and bring back item(secondary), stealth for item/assination.(once per island).The Grand battles break up the flow and usually consist of several stages each with a set goal - kill 1 shamen, kill 2 shamen kill 3 shamen... etc... this can either be done directly or by killing optional targets to charge up the dragons and then watching them via cutscene fullfil the primary objectives.Although for the most part an enjoyable game if somewhat repetative this suffers from being a console port and having some particularly annoying features all of which are showcased to a high degree in the final mission/bossfight.Tight POV with overly large player character dominating the screen.Nasty camera with impeded vision from environment/sfx. The camera also has an auto-return function making it difficult to handle while getting smacked around or travelling uphill.semi-auto target lock - can get real annoying at times when the combo switches target mid sequence or doesn't lock.Gamepad orientated controls with repeat tap action for environment interaction and bossess.30fps cap - any framerate dips lead to sluggish controls (Reported - Nvidia issues).halfscreen draw distance for grass etc very noticable in snow environments.No real graphics customisation beyond low/medium/high defaults... although the game directory can be directly editted.Does what is does farily well - could have been so much better.

												I hate twitch games that are more about physical dexterity than strategy or mental dexterity.  I didn't know beforehand that this game included twitch elements.  Once I realized that it did I still persisted, right up to the final boss battle of the game.  That particular fight was choreographed so tightly, and the method of on-screen prompting for each ""move"" so poor, that after an agonizing 35 minutes I still hadn't succeeded in replicating the moves the game demands for victory.  Instead of savoring victory, I cut my losses and frustration and quit the game and immediately uninstalled it.  Fortunately the game's poor reception meant that I didn't pay a dime for it, so all I lost was 40 or so hours; not all of that time was entirely unpleasant, but I was denied the satisfaction of closure and completion... all because of stupid twitches.

												This is perhaps the worst pc port I've ever played, basically as bad as Dark Souls for pc, but worse, as the game itself isn't as good as dark souls. Repetative combat, and a janky camera don't work well together. Also, when you die, the game teleports you back to the last portal you took, but since there is no sprinting of any kind in this game, you end up going back to the place you died over and over and over again.

												Simple hack and slash with a few adventure elements, and walking around enjoying the view. All the game is kind of repetitive, with the same mechanics repeated over and over again, and at half the game you have already fought vs every kind of enemy, so no more surprises (not even the final boss... kind of disappointing). The prime element in the game are the big battles, were instead of Skarin (you) vs a few, there is Skarin + lots of vikings + dragons vs tons of enemies. Three islands, two big battles on each (only one on the first). It's a great game for the price you pay on Steam.Technically it has the FPS caped at 30, and it is a game with bigger frame drops during battles, and dropping from 30 to 22 is horrid, it was horrid on console, and is specially horrid on PC.

												Viking: Battle for Asgard is pretty cool I guess.Set during true historical events when an army of endless Viking zombies invaded Denmark, Germans: Battle for Berlin follows the blights of Skarin, a powerful warrior with amazing hair.  After being injured in battle, Skarin is visited by the three fairy god mothers. Except there's only one, her name is Freya and she tells you that Hel is super mad and is invading the world of the living.So mom tells you that you should be her champion in return that she heals your wounds and rids your besieged town from the zombie scourge. Why she doesn't just do this at any given time is beyond me, but I digress. From here, Skarin and his hair are sent out on a journey to amass an army of not-zombie Vikings to fight the zombie Vikings for total Viking supremacy. I would also like to add that Viking is a fun word to say. Your journey takes you across three islands on your quest to make Hel your girlfriend. Each of these islands has two or three major locations you and your army needs to take over. See, this is where♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real. France: Battle for Paris is made by Creative Assembly, a dev team known for their Total War games which always boasts large numbers of units on screen at once. So when♥♥♥♥♥♥gets too hot with the other gang, you bring all of your homeboys at once in what can only be described as the world's angriest mosh pit. For it's original release, you could have called Viking a sort of tech demo for later Total War games. See, your boys and Hel's boys don't just whack at each other with bats that look like swords, they actually single one another out for pretty cool looking duels. They wrestle, they clash, stab, cut, whatever to get the other guy to stop moving around so much.  But where do you come in in this whole escapade of violence? Much like my high school self, Skarin is violent and prone to kill people. He plays much like a slower, less angry Kratos. You have a strong attack, a heavy attack, a list of combos, as well as a dodge and a block/counter mechanic. Mix these together with some lame stealth segments and some pretty cool magic mechanics, and Skarin is a dangerous adversary in his quest to date the goddess of the Dead. But all this being said, should you play Spain: Battle for Madrid. It's repetitive, there's a lot of walking and just picking stuff up. But when the game gets going, ho man does it get going. The big battles are grand enough to get your blood pumping, which is good because that's the games biggest selling point.The game is a port from a console game that came out quite awhile ago, and you'll probably see a lot of technical problems from the era. Get this game on sale, if not just for the few and far between big scraps. Poland: Battle for Warsaw gets 3 smelly men from the middle ages out of 6. Rats and horses can't vomit.

												7/10 - A solid action adventure that falls short of being great.Gonna keep this short and sweet. Viking is an action adventure game that takes strong cues from God of War and Dark Siders, but does only one thing new. From a quality and visual perspective, it is a solid title. I think that the mass battles and special buffs the hero can give his soldiers are an interesting touch, but don't do enough to make the game stand apart from its AAA predecessors.The environments are well made and pleasant, but lack the grandness that I feel a Viking Epic deserves; and frankly what I've come to expect from these kinds of games after GoW and DS.At the end of the day, its plenty fun and challenging enough to warrant the price, especially if you catch it on sale.

												I have to admit this is a really awesome game.. I don't remember having any games in recent memory with this good of a combat system.And its hard as hell too, its not some hand-held dumbed down adventure.Only con is 30fps cap.

												You get to be a podgy viking who goes round saving all his podgy viking chums who are apparently ♥♥♥♥ing useless. Meanwhile, you're an effectively immortal demigod raising an army to fight another army of podgy people who are evil, for reasons I skimmed over. Your tasks will consist of going to various locations in the realm, mostly without fast travel, to rescue soldiers for the big final battle. Did I mention there are dragons? You can command them in the final battle. But, like, only once or twice. Then they go away forever.			",145,22,2,11,29,1,31

												Just got this off a sale, and haven't tried it on steam yet though I used to have it on xbox 360 about 4 or 5 years or so  back. It could have been better in ways, but I still had a blast playing it back then. I remember the zones being pretty open, but the zones were related to the point of the sotry i was in (I couldn't return to the zone fromt he first parts of the story once I'd been moved to the area for the next part).  It's a decent game if you like thied person hack and slash and fairly open regions to complete the area clears in. I also liked the norse mythological characters being used in this game. Norse gods are among my favorite... they tie alongside the egyptian and greek/roman gods in my personal interests			",407,76,4,85,14,0,62

												So here is the thing. Battles are pretty much on point. I love them. Would have been better if more like sparten total war mixed with the kinda open world of this. But this game feels rushed. Graphics are not bad. But story is horrible. Game gets repetitive. Add some strategy into the game more like commanding the troops and more in depth of why locations captured are important and how big a difference those locations can make. IF taken a little more time could have been way better. IF your utterly bored yeah get the game it kills some time. Oh and battle controls could have been a little better and more expanded on as well.			",32,3,0,13,16,0,18

												Viking: Battle for Asgard (V:BA) gets a thumbs down from me because I have already played games like it that were far more fun.  The story of V:BA involves Skarin, a viking who is granted immortality and uses it to wage a guerilla war against a demon army.  The single player is composed of three islands that follow the same formula: clear points of interest (POI) under demon control through stealth or meleee combat, free imprisoned vikings at the POI, do search-and-destroy/fetch quests to gain allies/items, summon a dragon, assualt the fortress on the island, fight the boss, and finally advance to the next island to do it all again.  You will clear the same POI's on each island and fight the same monsters during each siege all the while enjoying one of the games three musical tracks.  Sound and voice work are below average at times, bordering so-bad-its-good territory.  Combat is stiff and gets stale halfway through the game because you've fought every enemy you'll see.  You get to do some pretty epic things (large scale battles with hundreds of npcs) in this game, but the framerate cap, repetitive nature of the game, and lack of polish make me glad I got this one for free.

												I really liked this game. It's made by the same company that did the Total War series and it kind of feels similar to playing as a troop during one of their battles at times.It's very similar to some of the action genre staples like God of War, Darksiders etc but your character unlike most games is not overpowered and if you get into a fight with too many opposition troops at once then you'll quickly get destroyed. The game largely relies on you personally becoming better at utilising the combat moves as the game develops, rather than making you increasingly more powerful so that the basic moves are still just as good at the start.. I greatly prefer this method as by the end of the game you feel pretty skillful at combat because of this.. it becomes all about timed dodges and moves to destroy armor and shields, it's quite technical for an action game but at first when you don't have access to all the available moves and you're just starting out the same technical feel instead feels quite clunky but it does develop into something good.Some aspects of the game are a little bit repetative, but they're not overly tedious while being much of the same thing you just did recycled as theres a decent number of enemy types and they all require slightly different tactics to beat.Some of the large battles are genuinely quite difficult as once they start you have no direct control over any of the troops on your side and some of the objectives are much easier when you have their backing, as charging in by yourself doesn't work out so well generally but it does give the feeling of being involved in a proper conflict, though the constant voice overs of someone demanding that you go kill the enemy shaman etc is a bit annoying when you're trying to get some of your troops through enemy lines to help you out.Overall I would recommend this game. For the price it goes for when it's on sale or in bundles these days it's a steal.			",1273,462,43,174,110,11,227

												Perhaps one of the games I loved the most, and I'm not even kidding or exaggerating here. I've always been a fan of epic things, great battles, great musics, great landscapes, you know, that kind of things, and well, except musics, this game gave me everything. Battles, blood, mythology, landscapes, and most of all, epicness. Picture yourself charging through the blasted open doors of a fortress with hundreds of enemies waiting for you, screaming and roaring as you approach followed by your own men, flaming arrows enlightening the sky of their crimson bright, burning like shooting stars, and then it all starts, the melee, the death, the massacre, you slaughter your way through the numerous enemies which keep coming, and you finally meet one of their officers, so you fight him, while your men fight his, and you defeat him, and you keep keep going, and while you forgot to breathe as you were so focused in the battle, there's a cinematic, you move forward, on a bridge, your men are behind you, his men are behind him, you're gonna duel for this bridge, flaming arrows keep going, but you don't care, you're fighint, no music, music may bring epicness, but sometimes, trust me, no music brings it ever more.You got the picture ? Well, that's only one of the things you'll see in this game.Let's be honest, there's a whole lot of pointless exploration, but the magnificent landscapes are enough for you to forget the length of the walk, and then, the battles are so amazing that you won't even notice you don't have any music, or maybe there is, let's be honest, I did the game twice, I never payed any attention to it.Pros:-Magnificent landscapes-Epic battles-Very good AI (on both camps)-Real progression of fighting (people don't just chill in the background, if you take an arrow, you're hurt and can die, someone can always backstab you or get your back, etc.)-Simple yet efficient gameplay-Nordic mythology is amazingCons:-No music-Exploration phases can be pretty long-Gameplay can look a bit easy when you got the mechanics (it's up to you to put some challenge, by not using spells for example)-Scenario lacks interest to be honest.

												♥♥♥♥ing horrible game. The most repetitive garbage ever. The game asks you to 'free vikings', doesn't even give you a ♥♥♥♥ing number on how much vikings you have. No way to control them even! In addition to the vikings you need to rescue to progress, there are stacks of 3-4 vikings scattered across the map which can be rescued, but there is literally no reason to! It doesn't matter one ♥♥♥♥ing bit.3 islands(levels/zones) in the game. You have to do the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing each ♥♥♥♥ing area. Rescue vikings, 'liberate zones', find gem, 'infiltrate' enemy base using 'stealth'. And it's a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ing butt to navigate the map! You'll tire of it within the first couple of hours. Especially the final island. You will be having the 'how the ♥♥♥♥ do i get there?' moments, and not in the good sense.Story is meh.The only decent thing in this game is the combat. It's fun and got plenty of gore. Occasionally, you'll find literally a horde, around 30-50 mobs moving in formation and yes you can even fight them all alone, but dont expect to win without using some cheap exploit like getting  them to fall off cliffs.At the end of each island, you'll have to wage a war against the enemy base. You and your rescued vikings vs the enemy legion. They basically charge at each other, endlessly respawning until you complete the  objectives (same objectives every island). Which is : Kill the shaman.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets ridiculously repetittive, especially the 2nd island where you need to kill like 6 shaman to progress.QTE ♥♥♥♥fest. Fighting the giants, holy ♥♥♥♥ dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ Attack his knees a couple times to trigger a ♥♥♥♥ing 20-30 second QTE, which is split up into 3 ♥♥♥♥ing parts. Yes, 3 QTES to kill 1 ♥♥♥♥ing giant. THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ing QTE ANIMATION FOR EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING GIANT JESUS ♥♥♥♥ING WHYY??? WHO DID THIS?? WHO HURT YOU??THe final boss? A ♥♥♥♥ING GIANT!! A GOD DAMN ♥♥♥♥ING GIANT WHICH HAS THE EXACT SAME ♥♥♥♥ING QTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELAZY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ING GAME!DO NOT EVER BUY.  Not even if held at gunpoint. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't gotten anywhere near finishing this game yet, but so far I love it. There was a lot of thought put into what the characters look like, how they fight, and what's important to them. The application of Norse mythos is well done. My only grievance (which I might still figure out) is that I cannot find any place to go back and change the controls. You can play Vikings: Battle for Asgard via keyboard or consol, but it was originally made for consol. Some of the keyboard buttons chosen to stand in for the controler buttons are a bit wonky, which you don't find out until you're playing the game. I would like to go back and change them, but so far I've had no luck. Which means I don't get to use fancy skills...but! Even without said fancy skills, this game is still awesome. I recommend it for anyone who likes Norse mythology/Viking things, and/or anyone who just wants a nicely made, first person, slice-n-dice game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I usually don't give bad reviews because I try to see what the game has to offer rather than what it fell short of.That said, Viking: Battle for Asgard was a complete mess.Not only is it terribly optimized so even a GTX 1070 can't play this 2012 game, it is also rife with unintuitive controls ported from console by people who've obviously never played on PC before.Also, when you turn the camera with your mouse, the everything besides your character tears and frame-rate experiences dips. I had to avoid moving the mouse too much to avoid migraines.Worst of all, you cannot change graphics settings IN-GAME - you have to close the program, run a config, and then reopen it, get into the game, playtest, see if you like the changes, and then change again if something's off, which takes forever to set up.We're not done yet. Besides all that jarring crap ^, the gameplay itself isn't well thought out either.The game is supposed to be about combat. What if I told you they tried so hard to make things flashy that half the time you die because you're locked in long animation sequences whenever you perform moves?Case in point; Round-house-dragon-penes-odin-love-juices-stab move sprinkled with ice rune magic feels clumsy rather than bad♥♥♥♥♥ especially when a noob minion with just cleaner attacks knock you out of animation every time. What's the point in learning new moves when it's more effective to just left-click your way to victory?How do you progress you wonder? By buying everything in a store. Want an Odin-love-juice move? Pay gold. I'm serious. Whereas there's plot, trials, and a journey of some kind to obtain great power in other games, here there's just a shopkeeper. If these shop owners are so strong, why doesn't he lead the Vikings? Disgusting - the developers didn't even try.I stopped after 1.1 hrs of gameplay and gave up because my index finger got tired and I needed something for my headache.Would NOT EVER recommend. Not even if I received this for free. Not even if someone paid me and my medical bills to play this - because I'll never get my 1.1 hrs back.			",119,41,1,20,9,1,16

												If you played the 360 version, it's pretty much the same. For those that haven't: Viking: Battler for Asgard is a hack-n-slash style of game with some executions thrown into the combat. RPG elements are in the game as well, though could've been better and more varied in skills/moves. There's 3 open-world maps to fight on where you undertake missions to gather your army, which culminates into some epic battles. The story (from what I recall) is kind of a typical ""Chosen One hero fends off the evil and unites all the people to fight the evil!"" with Vikings//Norse mythology. That's not to knock it too harshly in that aspect, as it would be an interesting read if it was fleshed out in a book. The game itself doesn't feel incredibly deep, you can blaze through it pretty quickly. However, if you're a completionist it'll take a bit longer, but not much. Once the campaign is over, that's pretty much it.Considering the age of the game, it was alright for it's time and still stands at an alright level. To me, this game had a lot of potential that it didn't quite live up to. Never did capture the magic that Spartan: Total Warrior had back on the PS2/Xbox. Grab it on a sale, and have a 360 controller on hand since the KB&M controls are relatively terrible in my opinion. If you still have a copy of Spartan: Total Warrior or have that game in some way, I'd play that instead and grab this when it's $1. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the negative reviews of disdain of the PC port, I think this game is great on console and PC and packs a good  amount of content for 15$. FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT. WOULD HEAVILY RECOMMEND CONTROLLER. I'm sure the reason so many people disapprove of this port is because they tried to play with keyboard and mouse which consists of total♥♥♥♥♥♥for optimization. Don't use it. It's a great game with controller and aside from the fact that you practically need to use one, the game is refined perfectly.			",87,16,0,11,6,1,2

												Pretty much your normal hack n' slash game with some rpg elements and cool big army battles, and better, has vikings, and you don't see them very often, specially from SEGA and Creative Assembly( total war makers). Gameplay is feking fun, love it, graphs are alrigth, enemies.... not a lot of variation, map desing is alrigth, but the thing that will make most ppl go and unstall the game is the awfull FPS CAP, Slowdown city basicly, so unless you don't have a problem with that, you'll be alrigth getting this game at a sale, but i would advise, if you like hack n'slash games, check Brütal Legend or other titles, they are much worthwhile.

												Starts off enjoyable enough, then when I came to climb the ruins I could not progress. It turns out you have to unplug the controller and use keyboard for those particular climbing jumps. Thats right, the controller doesn't activate the move properly and neither does the keyboard until the controller is unplugged. It gets worse, there are also jumps across gaps that cannot also be cleared using the controller. Consequently unplayable.Thanks for the free game Sega, but I am now annoyed for the waste of time.

												A great ""gamey"" game.In terms of the core of what makes video games this game has it to a decent degree. At first the medicore reviews put me off but what that really means is that it does common things but quite well. Combat is decent , enemies are varied and fun to fight. Story is the weakest part but its just there to hold the rest together and give you a reason to play.Liberate fellow vikings to make them join your army, get dragons to join you, etc. Then have these massive battles against the legion, which you are a part of and fight along side hundreds of soldiers going to rush at each other in war. Not many games let you do that and you can do it numerous times in this game.My main issue is the lack of weapon variety, you supposedly ""upgrade"" weapons but they are the same with a bit more damage. From start to finish its the same character model and weapons etc. All upgrades are just damage nothing else. Overall its a very good game that does regular stuff really well. Worth it if you like ""gamey"" video games.			",114,14,3,11,4,2,7

												Probably one of the more relaxing action games I've played. Given you do the same thing over-and-over, for hours. The game's combat isn't horrible, but it isn't good. There are moves that are just simply better. (jump + heavy attack kills most things in one hit.) But the most important move is shoving. Why? Because in this magical world of Odin-loving-bearded-manly-men, falling from anything more than three feet causes everything to die of a heart attack. So you will probably find yourself fighting near cliffs.The music was very good! Albeit, you'll probably enjoy running from landmark to landmark (as fast travel is more of a task than anything in this game) with Amon Amarth playing instead.All-in-all, the game was mindless and fun in a way. Despite being ridiculously bland in that it didn't change anything up from minute 1 to hour 8 of playing. So if you like time waster games with lots of filler, then it's the game for you.

												I'm not an especially skilled gamer.  I played Bioshock on Easy and found it to be mildly challenging.  So when I say that this game is insultingly easy, I mean that a reasonably coordinated three-year-old could master it.  You have /seconds/ after an enemy starts to attack to hit your parry button, and it's nothing to survive an entire swarm of them with most of your hit points remaining.  The few times that I've died are nothing but a testament to how phenomenally lazy I was during that fight.  Coordination?  Who needs it, just mash a few reasonably-timed buttons and you're golden.

												I didn't like the game very much.In my opinion the game was not that bad after all but the repetitive quest structure seemed like they run out of ideas pretty quick. You literally do the same things on three different island i.e. collecting Kegs for an Inn-Keeper. Furthermore the level design dull and you had to run way too long trough a lifeless environment. Above that the story was cheese and I couldn't really feel it. The game seemed a little like a boring brother of god of war.			",128,29,0,26,17,0,14

												The liklihood is you are reading this because you either bought a Total War bundle that came with this, or are considering it.  If you are just considering buying it seperately - know this: this game is not a good one.  It drags on for 12 hours of mostly tedium, with repetative 2-button combat interspered with the same QTE's all the way through.This game is also a bad port.  Every time you launch via Steam, it will ask your permission to download distributables, then give you the option to configure its minimal pc settings (which can't be changed in-game) or launch.  That option window will be launched at least 6 times every time you play, so when you quit, you'll have to shut all the redundant ones down.The game is limited to 30 fps.As the intro blubs mentioned the game was designed for a gamepad, and the keyboard config looked terrible, i opted to play on a 360 controller.  That meant inverting the y-axis as is my custom.  This you have to do every single time you launch the game, as it does not remember game settings.The actual game involes a mute viking called Skarin, who is made immortal by Freya to fight the undead Legion of Hel's army.  The game takes place in 3 maps.  On each map you liberate small bands of viking warriors (fully armed and armoured in their cage) at various locations to bring them under your banner, track down a dragon stones to summon a dragon, then assaulting one or two fortresses to complete the map.The assaults on the fortresses allow you to use the dragon(s) you aquire to aid you, but you need dragon runes to use their one-shot kill attacks on targets.  You get runes by either defeating enemy shaman (who constantly resurect their allies - and are always the main targets of the assault), or killing enemy champions or giants by spamming your power attacks and then finishing them off with a QTE.  Your viking buddies will assist you, but you have to do all the heavy lifting.In these battles, it is very difficult to know what the hell is going on with regards to who you are attacking and who is attacking you.  This will lead to a lot of damage being taken.  If at any point you are surrounded by a large group, you can expect to die, you have no AOE attack, and the enemies will stun-lock you and wipe you out quickly.Your attacks are limited to quick and heavy, with heavy limited to being stuck on the end of a combo due to its long charge up time to use on its own.  You can learn some extra attacks for gold that do heavier damage by consuming ""rage"" which is generated by hitting enemies.  You can finish enemies off with a heavy attack once they lose a limb to generate more red souls, which enable you to charge your weapon and allies around you with an element (fire, lightning or ice).Thrown into the hack and slash is a stealth element, which enables you to one-shot enemies that are unaware, and gives rise to the incredibly frustrating missions to infiltrate the enemies fortress and do 'a thing' before your main assault on the fortress.  Getting spotted is easy if you don't follow the preferred route to your objective, and will lead to getting mobbed and killed, meaning restarting the entire endeavour.The game is about 4 or 5 hours too long, not helped by the slow pace of your protagonist, who lumbers around painfully slowly between his goals.  You can fast travel between waystones, but only if you are at one already, and their position isn't always ideal.It is absolutely not worth £9.99.			",252,64,6,39,33,1,39

												Probably one of the more relaxing action games I've played. Given you do the same thing over-and-over, for hours. The game's combat isn't horrible, but it isn't good. There are moves that are just simply better. (jump + heavy attack kills most things in one hit.) But the most important move is shoving. Why? Because in this magical world of Odin-loving-bearded-manly-men, falling from anything more than three feet causes everything to die of a heart attack. So you will probably find yourself fighting near cliffs.The music was very good! Albeit, you'll probably enjoy running from landmark to landmark (as fast travel is more of a task than anything in this game) with Amon Amarth playing instead.All-in-all, the game was mindless and fun in a way. Despite being ridiculously bland in that it didn't change anything up from minute 1 to hour 8 of playing. So if you like time waster games with lots of filler, then it's the game for you.

												I think the most frustrated thing in this game is that combat always restricted to 1v1, you get bored after a while, after 1 or 2 hours doing the same move over and over again. Although of the massive battles with many units, you always feel lack of something. Darksiders did this better.			",186,29,2,29,19,3,56

												If you are a fan of Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, you should like this game.  This is pretty much the predecessor to Shadow of Mordor, it is obvious really quick that Mordor took many ideas from this game and built on them.  The port is bad and is locked at 30fps and a 360 controller is a must but I'm still finding it enjoyable.  Overall the visuals hold up, some of the battles have tons of characters on screen and are quite impressive, story is fairly basic and nothing really stands out about it other than it's fun.

												Its a terrible port from xbox to PC not much effort has been put into it, there is little graphics customisation so game lags quite a bit mostly in large battles thankfully, the game is perma capped at 30FPS which gives it a permanent lag feel to the game, the maps are cool, difficulty it to easy and gameplay becomes repetitive after  1-2 hours. Still this game was fun for a while so its not the worst game ive ever played but if your going to port a game to pc to try earn some extra money atleast try to make it playable on the computer.  This game is redicously easy but the lag from the graphic setup that was designed for xbox will lag your computer to bits even if you can play alot of modern games on ultra this one crappy game will find a way to lag you into a rage fit. Storyline was alrigt and graphics were good, gameplay average. Control setup is meant for xbox so make sure you customize it so its slightly playable with keyboard and mouse. 4/10 definatly not worth playing again or buying if you are considering doing so atleast not on PC anyway so get it for your console if your interested.

												Here's the thing, this game is mediocre in every way, and there's not much to say about it. IF you're a kid and got it in the humble bundle -- maybe it was worth the dollar to you, but I find that time means much more to me than the little money older/sale games cost (especially something that could be gotten for a dollar) and on that mark, this game fails miserably. If you want an experience in a similar vein, that is worth the time? I can only come up with Two Worlds (not the second one!) as something worth playing that you might not have already gotten. And even that, it's worth playing at least 60% because of how damned bad everything but the character development (which is surprisingly detailed, varied, and interesting) is. You spend a lot of time making fun of the thing, and then wander off into the wilderness, and once you're away from all the, you know, voice acting, you actually start having fun.

												Bloody, Savage and just a wee bit barbaric. I loved it!  The game is completely gamepad compatible, despite the fact that the store page makes no mention of it. The combat is very fluid, with some nice execution moves. Combine that with the beautiful graphics and open world, and you got a winner.Sure it's not as story rich or cinematic as I would have liked, but I still enjoyed myself, and had a jolly good time chopping my enemies in half.Rating: 6/10 -- Slightly better than average with some room for improvement, but still recommended for fans of bloody hack and slash games with a conan vibe.

The game itself is very much like a fable experience to me. The action and huge battles are awesome and exciting. Who knew. Hopefully they will make another one, or a sequel. Definitely a game pad game though.			",65,4,2,5,3,0,14

												I played this game back on Playstation orignally and figured I would pick it up for good old times. I think it still holds up pretty well, graphics are nice enough and the story keeps you into it enough to get you to finish that game. However dont try to play with with keybord/ mouse, Its a controller must game seems liek the only draw back but its still fun enough and worth the price. The silent character is kinda a draw back as it makes it hard to feel anything for him or his story. Ther eare large army battles at big points in the game and they are done VERY well and makes you feel as if you really are leading a large army into the fight. I also loved the Norse setting which might have swayed the review. All said and done its worth 15 bucks and if its ever on sale give it a shot hands down			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't enjoy this game because of how much they got srong about the lore. I didn't expect great accuracy or anything but just the premise that it's HELs minions you are fighting is wrong for many, many reasons. Hel is not really evil. Hel does not really meddle.Now if the invading forces were the ""giants"" (stupid translation, but whatever), that would make sense lorewise since most nonhuman creatures fall into this category.And the fact that Freja gives you her brisingamen is just..... Out of character. She slept with a lot of dwarves to get that thing.Hell, you might enjoy it for what it is.

												Judging by the preview images and the videos, i thought this game was going to be awesome and a little epic. After playing it a bit I was sworely mistaken. This game is horrible, everthing about it is horrible. The sound is very repetitve and sounds muffled. The sound effects sound like they came from a non-copyrighted free effects site. The visual are just plain bad even for a 360 game. This game also has almost no tutorial, so you have to find out everything yourself. This  to-date is Creative Assembly's WORST GAME I have ever played. Do not buy this game, unless it is on sale for less than 2$			",141,11,8,13,7,1,15

												I received this from humble bundle and so far it seems to keep me playing for a  game which came out in 2008. The graphics are ok and the voice work is excellent in fact its much better than many games out now. Gameplay reminds me of the old school hack and slash with an option to execute your enemies, bring back good memories. :)My rating of this game: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a terrible port from xbox to PC not much effort has been put into it, there is little graphics customisation so game lags quite a bit mostly in large battles thankfully, the game is perma capped at 30FPS which gives it a permanent lag feel to the game, the maps are cool, difficulty it to easy and gameplay becomes repetitive after  1-2 hours. Still this game was fun for a while so its not the worst game ive ever played but if your going to port a game to pc to try earn some extra money atleast try to make it playable on the computer.  This game is redicously easy but the lag from the graphic setup that was designed for xbox will lag your computer to bits even if you can play alot of modern games on ultra this one crappy game will find a way to lag you into a rage fit. Storyline was alrigt and graphics were good, gameplay average. Control setup is meant for xbox so make sure you customize it so its slightly playable with keyboard and mouse. 4/10 definatly not worth playing again or buying if you are considering doing so atleast not on PC anyway so get it for your console if your interested.

You are lietrally in the dark fumbling around trying to figure out what to do against large amounts of enemies that are just going to slay you and send you back to the starting point. The allies that you rescue don't bother to join you and help you either. You may as well leave them locked up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A mediocre port of a confused mess. Die-hard fans of the genre will probably enjoy it, but everyone else will have, at the very least, spurts of frustration throughout.

If you die, you instantly respawn (as in, before the final blow actually hits you you have already respawned in town)....and then you have to use a waypoint and run back to wherever you were....it is slightly tedious but combined with...-TERRIBLE edge mechanics. Many times a single enemy blow (OR YOUR OWN ATTACK) will cause you to fall over a cliff...to your death instantly...which means respawn in town, teleport to nearest waypoint, run back.....very annoying, especially combined with...-CLUNKY controls-Poor level design (results in excessive amounts of walking due to poorly placed waypoints)-Mediocre port (it isn't the worst port ever, but it is pretty bad....esp the map navigation)-No mouse support in menus / map screen-""Mash F"" to interact with objects. I don't know if gamepad players like to do this for some reason, but it certainly is not fun to mash a keyboard key repeatedly just to use a waypoint / interact with world objects / open chests / etc. I'd rather just push it once, or if I have to, hold the button.Many better games in the genre.

												This game looks like it would be fun, but it isn't that great. I thought it might have more strategy elements in the big battles (hoping for a Total War style battle that you could actually get involved in with a player-controlled unit) but it is just a bunch of enemies with no dynamic shifts in power on the battlefield until you run past them and get to an objective to take out. Combat was really quite clunky with the mouse and keyboard and wasn't particularly challenging or interesting. Hack and slash to the core. No RPG elements at all. You buy upgrades with the random sacks of gold scattered around the ""open world"" map, but the upgrades don't have any information about what they are before you buy them. The level design is very linear. You can choose which area to clear first, but they all must be cleared of minions before moving on to the next area or big battle. Graphics were ok despite a sad framerate limit because of the port.I played through the first island and won the first big battle. Wasn't impressed. I thought that summoning a dragon might make the game alot more fun. It didn't. How to use the dragon in the battle wasn't explained and so I just slashed my way through minions to some shamans while my dragon watched from above. I don't mind a hack and slash, so long as there is some interesting combat and RPG character development. This game just didn't do it for me so I won't be playing through the rest of this repetitive game.			",21,5,1,3,7,0,7

												One of the most boring confusing starts to a game.Boring: - It starts with no real story as to why you are there and who the hell you are- There is no prompt as to where to go/what to do- The controls are not spelt out for you... and they need to be!- Pretty much every avatar looks the same and is poorly dubbed when they speak to you Confusing:- The map is rubbish and you can't use your mouse to navigate it...- The missions are presented to you like a statement rather then a 'oh please get us some ale for the soldiers' its a 'I'm sorry but I done got no ale'... I didn't even ask for ale you ♥♥♥♥turd! Do you want me to get some? Or are you just stating your lack of basic supplies?!?!?!?- As I mentioned in the 'Boring' tab there is no suggestion as to how to block or combo or anythingI could go on but I doubt anyone has read up to this point.... This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and I'd rather thrust a dull blade in my urethra then play it for another second....  ",68,2,0,11,9,0,16

												I thought this was going to be a wargame with ARPG type bits. I knew it was was a console port and although I don't mind crummy interfaces and save points and the like, this actually made me feel pity that anyone could require so much exposition in order to understand such a basic game. The big battles might as well be backgrounds - all you do is fight a series of duels with it going on around you. I'm not certain of this, but during the first one I got the feeling that actually the vikings you release all over the place: they aren't units, they're just little keys in a fetch quest. When you have ""enough"" of them you can do the big siege at the end. But they don't run out. They carry on being infinitely replenished until you finish whatever duels or press whatever switches on the battlefield, which causes them to spawn a bit further forward. And the duels with big enemy champions... are quicktime events. So it's a wargame with as much wargame in it as Legacy of Kain. And equally convincing Vikings.			",185,68,3,52,17,1,64

												The game is all about combat, and the combat just isn't exciting at all. You are instantly thrown into a story with terrible plot and you just run from place to place doing side quests and killing more things; I honestly wouldn't mind this at all if the combat was good, but it just feels really clunky, and you can't even counter attacks, you can only block.If this game had Shadow of Mordor combat (A.K.A Batman combat) then it'd be pretty damn fun and I'd put more time into it than the very short amount of time that I have so far.If you're looking for a combat game, this is a bad combat game to buy, and if you're looking for anything else, this is still a bad game to buy.P.S: This is a bad console port and a controller is an absolute necessity to play this game, in my opinion.

												Want to feel like a Viking? Play Mount & Blade. In short; badly ported, poor controls, clunky combat and a worthless story. In long;From the begining the game does a terrible job explaining how to play. Nothing tells the player which buttons do what. Experimenting with the controls before entering combat wont help, because the main character will just draw his swords and thrust them in the direction he is facing rather than demonstrate a light or heavy attack.Visually, the game is lacking. The poor optimization limits the quality of the game to the moderate preset on my computer. Animations are slow and clunky, sound assets are ear-bleedingly bad, and the texturework is just ugly.Combat feels pretty slow, lacks weight and variety at first. In the begining all the player can do is mash A for light attacks, X for heavy, and hold Lbumper do defend. It is possible to learn combos in the Arena, but they probably wont be used often, and are expensive to learn. There are also 3 types of runes and 3 items, one of which is a healing potion. I'm describing the controls for an Xbox controller, because keybard controls are rediculously hard to use. Using the keyboard, even if the default keys are rebound, will require the player to reach across to perfom different moves.The story makes no sense at all. The game opens with Freja, a norse goddess, giving an amulet to the main character and explaining that he needs to lead an army to stop Hel from invading and conquering the world, and thats it. No reason is given for why Hel is invading Midgard, or why the other gods wont interfere, or even who the main character is. Hints are given that the main character is possessed by a demon, but nothing other than that is said.			",159,27,4,29,26,3,37

												This is a very interesting game, I love the combat system and its really kinda like a more compact version of the witcher 2, much less emcumbersome on your machine and has a gameplay like god of war meets dungeon siege. I would recommend this to those who kinda don't have alot of money to spend or a suped up pc. especailly if your interested in a great game with a solid storyline, and a affordable price.

												A great ""gamey"" game.In terms of the core of what makes video games this game has it to a decent degree. At first the medicore reviews put me off but what that really means is that it does common things but quite well. Combat is decent , enemies are varied and fun to fight. Story is the weakest part but its just there to hold the rest together and give you a reason to play.Liberate fellow vikings to make them join your army, get dragons to join you, etc. Then have these massive battles against the legion, which you are a part of and fight along side hundreds of soldiers going to rush at each other in war. Not many games let you do that and you can do it numerous times in this game.My main issue is the lack of weapon variety, you supposedly ""upgrade"" weapons but they are the same with a bit more damage. From start to finish its the same character model and weapons etc. All upgrades are just damage nothing else. Overall its a very good game that does regular stuff really well. Worth it if you like ""gamey"" video games.			",114,14,3,11,4,2,7

												I have to agree with what many have said.. the idea of this game is great.. the graphics are decent enough.. but the gameplay..  that is where it falls flat on it's face..  If you are in a group of enemies larger than 3, you are going to be killed.. OVER and OVER and OVER.. why?  because the gameplay mechanics are HORRIBLE..  some sort of lock on thing that fails horribly...  blocking that is next to worthless.. and random pot shots by some offscreen medieval sniper or someshit..  I wouldn't buy this game if they offered it free, honestly.. you will get frustrated in the first hour..  I have tried getting back into it several times.. but, after I write this review.. I am removing it from my pc.. it's just junk.			",109,7,13,5,6,0,5

												I'm not an especially skilled gamer.  I played Bioshock on Easy and found it to be mildly challenging.  So when I say that this game is insultingly easy, I mean that a reasonably coordinated three-year-old could master it.  You have /seconds/ after an enemy starts to attack to hit your parry button, and it's nothing to survive an entire swarm of them with most of your hit points remaining.  The few times that I've died are nothing but a testament to how phenomenally lazy I was during that fight.  Coordination?  Who needs it, just mash a few reasonably-timed buttons and you're golden.
