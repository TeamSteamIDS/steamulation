												The Stranger won't play by your rules, pardner.A fascinating little game that actively refuses to be pinned down. It's a third-person FPS, but not really, because you are usually shooting tools rather than bullets. It's a personal story of a bounty hunter who's only in it for the money, except when it absolutely isn't. It's a methodical game of eliminating enemies with stealth and cunning – whenever it doesn't happen to be a game about massive explosions. Not even the tutorial seems to grasp quite what this is. Odd, but sort of brilliant at the same time.			",245,124,1,28,8,1,32

												This game quickly became a stapple of my childhood back on the original xbox. I remember waking up early before school and playing before the day had even begun. Its a fantastic blend between 1st and 3rd person view that no other game has seemed to capture.  It looks great and plays even better for its age. And the crude, dark humor really makes it a part of the Oddworld universe. I will never forget my first runthrough of this game. One of my top five games of all time, hands down.Buy it.

												As someone who missed this game when it came to the original XBOX, this was my first time playing it and I must say it is fantastic! When comparing this HD version to the original, you can see that this is one of the best remastered jobs out there. The game still looks very good by today's standards with all the settings cranked up (via Nvidia Control Panel).This game also has one of the most innovative mechanics I've come across in a while: live ammo. You must hunt your ammo. This is a really cool twist and the ammo variety is quite great. The bounty system in the first half of the game is really fun and the second half succeeds as an action game as well. The blend of third/first person is also done particularly well.It's hard for me to really have any complaints witht this game. I was just surprised at how much fun I had playing it. If you missed it the first time or even played the original, I highly highly reccomend picking this title up. Here's hoping a sequel can eventually be made to expound on this Wild West gem.

												I use to see this game a lot at the video store as a kid and it really intrigued me but not enough to hire it out, never really gave it solid try and I regreted that decision until now. Thoroughly enjoyed playing this game in its entirety, the Oddworld universe is represented extremely well in this game with its dry humor and incredibly dark setting. There is not much of a connection between Strangers Wrath and the other Oddworld games beyond small refernces to products manufactured by the Glukkons and Vykkers (Bad guys in the previous games) spread throughout the Mongo Valley, but this detachment from the other games is not a bad thing as it gave the game an ability to explore more of the Oddworld universe and what inhabits it.Some bad things about the game, well the actual story and gameplay was enjoyable and the PC port controls were really smooth but trying to get a controller working on my end was an extreme pain so I just gave up.  The soundtrack was freaking radical, whenever the tunes started it really helped set the scene but the downside to this was the music sometimes bugged and stopped playing for me! In short if you can't be bothered reading whats above (Sounds better in my head). I really recommend you get this game if you are a fan of the Oddworld and its dark setting. If you just found the first two games a pain in the egg to complete this is a refreshing ride.[8.5/10]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay was surprisingly good and offers a unique experience.  The graphics and environment offered a unique experience that would be expected from an Oddworld game.  Fair warning to those with AMD machines, as I ran into some pretty annoying bugs that caused me to crash to desktop multiple times, and I found others with similar machines had the same problem.  If you can put up with this small annoyance, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. [9/10]			",346,129,22,41,54,6,56

Well what's more incredible is that this game fluidly, equally, and seemlessly blends both third person and first person gameplay in a hilarious, epic story about a badass bounty hunter. But there's more about this bounty hunter than meets the eye. This game was made when people still cared about making GOOD games  instead of cash grabs and you'll love it.

												This game is an adventure / FPS hybrid. You switch between the modes as you explore the strange Oddworld landscape. So you would do some jumping puzzles and then blast away the enemies with your crossbow. The crossbow is powered by live animals which you pick up as you travel along. You can pick up stingbees that rapidly fire at the enemies or spiders that web them and many more. The mechanic is a bit bulky because you constantly have to switch between 3rd and 1st person. The world itself is beautiful with various landscapes from forests to deserts to icy tundras and mechanical fortresses. It's a very fun game but a bit frustrating sometimes even on normal difficulty. The battle before the final boss was pretty ridiculous with enemies chain stunning you so you have no chance to survive (except luck). I would still recommend this. 7/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												Stranger's Wrath is an interesting shooter slash third person game to say the least. You take on the roll of a mysterious bounty hunter named Stranger who is trying to gather 20 000 Moolah for a surgery he says he ""needs to survive"" but not more is said in the beginning of the game. He hates guns, and uses nothing but his crossbow on his hand with unusual live ammo like Fuzzles and Bolamites. PROS:unique game style+- 13 hour gameplay (on hard)Great visuals(I have to put this in) The way Stranger sprintsCONS:Most non-story achievements are brokenGame can be glitchy (in the end levels for me)CONCLUSION:Stranger's Wrath is an awesome game for anyone looking for something different in the FPS genre and just need a break from typical shooters. While the mechanics between first person and third are unsure what the game is supposed to be, they work together well enough to make the game enjoyable8/10 Silky Drawers			",175,22,5,27,6,3,5

												Beware users of Intel drivers, this game will immediately crash under many circumstances. Mine happened to occur after the Oddworld Inhabitants logo came and left, leaving me with an error stating the Game Has Stopped Working. After doing some research, it appears that this port of OSW from Just Add Water (JAW) has only recieved one patch since this whole debacle started about a year ago, and since then, nothing from what i can tell. They seem content with leaving this game behind, with numerous issues, as the only dev comment I've seen on my particular issue was roughly eight months ago.Other frequent issues I've seen thoughout my research include:-Crashes occuring in the tutorial level-Game succeeding in loading main menu to only show a black screen.-Instances where Stranger does not move-Taxing on graphics cards. Possibly poorly optimisedThis is all extrememely disappointing as the game was a classic from 3 console generations past, and probably one of my favorite games ever made. This makes the fact that I will be contacting Steam for my money back, much more aggrivating.If you must own this game, check out it's offering on GoG.com, as I have heard that they include the non-HD version of the game with the HD port, and I've heard that this may run better. Or, if you have a console that this port was re-released on, buy there. I've not seen issues for those ports.Support Oddworld Inhabitants by buying their stuff directly, such as their recently released OST for Strangers Wrath. Please do not support JAW, or at the very least, don't support their PC endeavors by buying this port. The port is utter trash that it will only work for some of the people who paid for it, and JAW is as well for not stepping up to fix their problems, and leaving a classic like this in such a horrible state.

												[8/10] - Just Add Water's console-to-PC port reawakens the 2005 Xbox release with better visuals, audio, and stability on the PC... for the most part. Stranger's Wrath is a fairly straight-forward action/adventure strategy game that introduces a unique gameplay mechanic where your ammo consists of tiny creatures each with a distinct ability to distract, devour, and destroy your enemies. The game allows you to seamlessly alternate between a third-person view for ease of mobility, and a first-person view for shooting the critters at foes and obstacles. Every level brings on a diverse challenge that can be approached differently each time and delivers enjoyable boss fights that can be demanding enough to make you rethink your strategy. The story is interesting and comical and introduces twists and turns that completely change the atmosphere of the game without going too far out into the bizzare. It IS an oddworld, after all.On the downside, Stranger's Wrath suffers from some aggravating glitches and performance flaws that remind you of the horrors that follow game ports. Issues such as loading errors, frame-rate drop, achievements not unlocking, textures missing, and incorrect subtitles are littered throughout the game. Stranger, the protagonist, has poor voice acting and every creature of the same species has the SAME voice-over which easily breaks the personality of the subservient characters, and diminishes the quality of the game itself. There is not much progression other than unlocking unique ammo and some minor upgrades. Most of the more interesting unlocks are not revealed until much later in the game, but at that point it really starts get a lot more exciting and fun.Overall, I found the game to be satisfying to the end. Playing on hard and attempting to capture the enemies alive rather than dead makes the game challenging, but not at all frustrating. With a little patience to tolerate the technical flaws, Stranger's Wrath can be a very enjoyable experience. Out of all the games included in the Oddbox anthology, this one is by far the best out of the four.			",171,14,3,19,17,0,13

												Stranger's Wrath is a really mindblowing and innovating game. Being 11 years old it still hold gameplay and mechanics, that are solid to this day. This game was so far ahead of its time.As a player you will get a huge amount of content, a huge variety of ammo and loads of different ways to complete the levels. You play as a bounty hunter and you are equipped with a crossbow, that uses ammo in forms of critters that you hunt. That means you shoot down bad guys with spiders, fuzzles or even bats! You choose yourself how you will deploy this ammo, as they all has their own purpose; wrap them in web, deploy as a living mine or shoot a living skunk that makes the enemy throw up. The games really leaves you with a whole lot of choices. You even get to decide if you want to kill the bandits, or catch them alive for a bigger bounty.The enviroment is great and I don't usually like deserts, but I found this one fun and exciting. It was in no way empty. As the game progress you are taken from the desert to the forest, temples, jungles and even more places, so the scenery constantly changes, with a lot of lore and detail, which keeps the player constantly occupied. Together with a lot of content and challenges, this really wraps up a good experience. I found to have ZERO problems playing this game and had no crashes at all. I was even surprised of how well and good the control and camera were. I felt it was made for PC. I did experience only getting the 'Easy'-achievement, even though I finished it on 'Hard'. All other achivements worked and I am sure this is not a common thing. The Achievements are fun and interesting to complete. They are realistic, but hard, so I would recommend doing them. Fun and a good challenge.For people who played the previous Oddworld games: You are in for a treat! Even though Abe and Munch is far away and not present, the keen eye will spot references and items from RuptureFarms and such. Even some of the wildlife that lives in these parts, also exists in Abe's part of Oddworld. The two are woven good together and the old-school fan will surely feel some nostalgia when noticing those things. The story is as always extremely good and really reflects on things from our real world. The game has a great message that is delivered with an awesome storytelling and interesting gameplay.This game's mechanics and content easily beats todays big games. They have always been very creative, the guys behind these games. The game is also very re-playable, which games rarely are.9.5/10*Would have been 10 if the Hard-achievement had worked for me.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Oddworld Inhabitants Publishers: Oddworld Inhabitants Initial release: Dec 2010Genre: FPS, Action#Worth/NotWorth: #CautionAdvisedExposition, Concurrence and SummationWARNING: Contains live ammunitionOddworld: Strangers Wrath is quite a departure from the previous Oddworld games. No side scrolling or rescuing other inhabitants. Well, not in the same way at least. In Strangers Wrath, you play as a bounty hunter and for most intents and purposes his name is stranger. Early on it is established he desires a surgery (to live). It is left ambiguous why exactly. As a bounty hunter you have the ability to switch between first and third person camera views. In first person mode you have a crossbow; You have different sorts of ammunition used for various purposes. Some examples would be laying traps, stunning, doing heavy damage and immobilization. The thing is is that the ammunition is live. No no, actually alive. They are animals and insects you are firing. You even must hunt them yourself. Though you can buy them from the general store should you desire. Your base ammo, the one that is always there (as in infinite) is zapflies which also have the ability to charge if you hold (as in stop firing) for a bit. Which gives you the ability to always deal some damage as well as stun should you completely run out of ammo. Since you have a lot of options when it comes to ammo, you also have the ability to capture enemies alive as well as bounties. With the difference being more moolah (the actual name of the currency in game) To be spent at the store on ammo and more upgrades like faster regen for stamina, clip extenders and overall more stamina. Stranger is rather impervious to damage (relatively) he actually can die very easily however he can literally just shake and the damage is taken away. With the exchange being stamina; So it's important to keep track of. Now, the reason I don't outright recommend this game is after a narrative twist the game has a sudden difficulty spike I wasn't terribly fond of; suddenly favoring capturing enemies alive as the more effective option rather than the more difficult one with higher reward. Also your ammo bags have been reduced (if you got them) but now capturing enemies restores ammo. It's a weird switch that I don't think everyone will be okay with especially if you were really enjoying the game loop before the twist.THE GIST The HD retexture is much appreciated. The game looks and plays very smoothly. However the difficulty spike won't appease everyone. Much to my chagrin.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,94,7,96

												Oddworld: Stranger's Whrath HD is a first/third person game. You are a bounty hunter who works his way up from capturing and turning in wanted criminals for Moolah. The reason why is becasue he needs an operation quickly but it costs 20,000 Moolah. You play a character simply called Stranger who uses like ammo to trap his enemies which is the only way you can turn them in.+ The game looks great and live, throughout the game every place looks great and diffrent which keeps you intrested. The option menu is good since there is alot of diffrent options for the grathics so most computers can run the game. + Storyline works well and since you will get paid differently depending whether you capture them dead or alive, but of course its harder to capture them alive bt you will get paid more. You also get to choose what bounty you want to go get which give you more freedom.+ There is a good length in this game since its around 10 hours on easy, 12 hours on medium and 15 hours on hard. This a good amount of time, you will get more time if you try to bounty everyone and explore the surroundings thoughout the game.+ Stranger's Wrath can be a hard game at times, first few hours are fine but then it starts getting alot harder and you will die alot at some points in the game. Its at a good level of difficulty since its not too hard that you want to give up, the game will make you want to get though the hard parts which makes it very rewarding when you get though it.+ The controls are good and work well with the keyboard and mouse, you can also change the keys to what ever you would like which is great since they can be changed to your liking. Only problem is that Stranger's Wrath does not have controller support.+ The music is great, it fits perfectly and does not get boring or repetitive. The music mainly plays when your exploring or when your fighting bosses, this works well because it really fits in with the mood of the scene. You can get the soundtrack from the Oddworld website for free.+ Having Steam Achievements and a good story means that there are some Replayability in the game since you can go back to complete all the achievements or just play th egame again. There is not much but there is enough.+ Stranger's Wrath is ten years old now. The HD edition is now five years old. It still holds up and looks good to this day. I dont think it will look outdated in some time now.- The PC port is bad! Really bad. Most computer will be able to run the game but the main problem is that the frame rate is always really low... I get around 25 to 30 on a R9 280X. It you want the game then be prepared.- For some reason Stranger's Wrath HD is really buggy, the original game isnt but this is. There are lots of bugs and some of them are game breaking. Since they dont update the game anymore you will have to put up with it... Real shame is I love the Oddworld franchise.Overall I would say Stranger's Wrath HD is a great and fun game that most people will like. Its original and diffrent which is whats great about Oddworld. I rate Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD an 8 out of 10. I would recommend the game if you can put up with the port and the bugs.			",116,9,1,8,13,0,3

												Overall it's a very good game, first played it back when it was released on the Xbox and I loved it then and I still love it now. I will not be giving away any spoilers because it's a game that everyone should play at least once, when I first picked up this game on Steam the only achievements were to get the bounties and now they added more and I think that’s great to see. However hearing people complain about that some achievements are broken does confuse me because all of them but one worked fine for me, The one that is broken for me is Sekto Suicide (at the time of writing this review) I went through the entire game three times (on each difficulty) and I earned the correct achievements for each difficulty, But when finishing it on hard mode to find out it's broken did♥♥♥♥♥♥me off a little bit but still does not hurt my love for this game and Oddworld games as a overall. I would give the game 9/10 only because like I said at the time of writing this people are having problems with earning achievements. If it ever gets fixed then change that nine to a ten! Basically...GET THIS GAME!			",101,10,2,6,13,3,6

Bounty huntin' platformer that's mostly a first-person shooter where your only real weapon is a crossbow that only fires living ammunition. There's a third person perspective but I only really found myself using that perspective for travelling and checking from behind cover. It ain't a traditional Oddworld game though it does take place in the same universe.Each town you go to has a bounty you can take to earn moolah which can be used to get yourself some upgrades or other possibly useful items. Each bounty or boss aren't entirely unique to one another though there can be an enjoyment had in each of 'em. After a town's been exhausted of its bounties you move on to travel to another town with bounties you can accept. Finding your next objective for the most part isn't always obvious or pointed out either. Directions are generally figured out by talking to townsfolk. Each type of ammo is used strategically whether you're planning on being sneaky or just straight up running in firing hornets at full auto, taking in baddies dead or alive, it's up to you.The stealth isn't very in-depth so learning from and manipulating it to your advantage shouldn't be very difficult especially since the AI can be as dumb as the characters they portray.

												Stranger's Wrath, (or for that matter, pretty much any Oddworld game) I have too much respect for. This game's art style and play style is astounding and I just can't give it enough applause. My favorite thing to do within the game is beating the poo out of Redneck-Chicken-People until they flip out and run into their houses, eventually they'll call you a ""P-e-c-k-e-r"" and start shooting at you. Anyway, I've had this game on the original Xbox since I was a wee little child and I just LOVE it. They have remastered the entire thing in HD and it looks amazing, I HIGHLY recommend this game more than any other game on steam, please get it... Seriously.. Get it now... You P-e-c-k-e-r.

												Have you ever wanted to step into the boots of a stone cold bounty hunter bringing in criminals and making piles of cash? Then this might just be the game for you. Oh and it takes place on an alien world where everything is crazy too.This game is great fun; it starts off a little slow but once it gets rolling you will have a hard time putting it down. Set in oddworld you know it’s going to be crazy. Every mission and town you go through has its own little narrative and everything seems to be an adventure all culminating in an epic tale of vengeance and surgery…..yes.I loved the bounty system, it’s one of my favourite things in any game and in this one it’s great. Take people in alive and get paid more money, even bosses can be brought in alive. It just adds another layer of challenge to the title. Something about collecting them all drove me to obsession.The story and world are obviously fantastic, neither are expanded on greatly but they add a sense that there is a lot more going on in the world around you and you are just carving your way through a very tiny part of it. The character you portray is a man of few words and that just adds to the mystery of who he is and what he wants.Now we talk about the weapon, you only get one but with the HUGE amount of ammo (living critters you catch and shoot at bad guys) you will not be disappointed. It is one of the most unique weapons I have used in any game and with all the upgrades you can get throughout the adventure it always seems new and fresh.The combat is fast paced and seamlessly switches from third person fighter to first person shooter. Both have their place and neither feels tacked on. There are tons of environments to explore and fight in and so many enemies to kill or capture each with their own personality. And the difficulty could be pretty brutal in places.I would recommend this game if you have a few hours to spare and want to get taken into a world that’s more crazy and odd than most. The npc’s are huge chickens for gods sake. On sale you have to have this.Have Fun ^_^ ",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												In Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, you will fill the boots of a strange, otherwise mysterious bounty hunter who tracks down villains and outlaws for ""moolah"" -- Wild West Wanted-Dead-or-Alive style. You'll explore a grand world of frontiers ranging from old Western towns, uninhabited wildernesses and some more modern type industrialized compounds. The game allows you to play in either third person or first person mode where third person view will be used mostly for exploration and first person mode for when it gets down to action and combat. The main character’s name is Stranger and he needs to raise money for a medical procedure he must undergo in order to survive. Stranger will go from town to town through forests and wildernesses, capturing outlaws and fighting his way through mob syndicates...all in the duty of the bounty assignments he receives from the local Bounty Store.The only weapon Stranger carries is a modified crossbow strapped to his forearm. This is a mean weapon and its ammunition is actual living creatures and critters which he harvests from the environment. There are plenty of it crawling and bouncing around. This unique ammunition is also upgraded as the game progresses through its various levels which in turn is a good thing, a very good thing, because crime bosses become extremely difficult to take down later in the game, especially on hard difficulty settings. Other in-game role-playing elements include amour storage upgrades and knuckle dusters.Doing bounty hunts might start to feel repetitive later on in the game and the pattern rather predictable, but the story takes a spin towards something different and totally unexpected. The story. That is essentially what distinguishes the guys at Oddworld Inhabitants from the rest. Their story telling technique. To me, personally, Oddworld's games are treasures. I first played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on PC back in 2000 and then later during 2006 I played Stranger's Wrath (maiden release) for the first time on console. The upgraded port of Stranger's Wrath, namely the HD version was first announced in 2010 for release on PC and PlayStation 3, developed by Just Add Water and is one of the more distinctive games released from the ""old"" generation. It's entertaining and fun, story rich, beautiful in HD and demonstrates the passion and love you get from the Oddworld Universe. I'm Odd... I recommend this game!			",149,32,3,2,9,0,3

I'm not saying the game sucks, I love Oddworld games and I'm sure this game is as good as the others I'm just warning you guys so you don't make the same mistake I did. Whatever Happens make sure to check the community discussions there is a chance that the developers might fix this...a small one...as you can see I've been hoping for that for a long time now...take care.

												I would very much like to recommend this game. I certainly can recommend the game itself, for it is an amazing game. An underrated hidden gem when it was first released. But this port is dreadful. My PC has the capabilities to run far more demanding games, such as Skyrim, but somehow falls flat when trying to run a game that was released on the original xbox. When I purchase a game I expect it to run perfectly, as advertised, without me having to fiddle around within the depths of its folders or what not. This does not run perfectly. It is unplayable in its current state. The game will constantly freeze for periods of increasing length the longer you play; the longest being at least 20 seconds. I have only managed to trudge through this to the end of the tutorial until it becomes unbareable. This was a waste of my money, and that's so disappointing to hear myself say as I love the Oddworld series and was willing to support them, but this is simply unplayable. I am yet to find any solution to this problem, if there even is one. I should have just whipped out my old xbox and found an original copy, rather then gamble on a HD remake.			",85,16,0,4,10,0,10

												If you like western shooters with a ♥♥♥♥♥in story and dialogue this game is for you. You play as a Bounty hunter, collecting ammo from the wild that is varied in how it works against your enemies (exploding them vs tying them up vs ect), which are outlaws. Collecting outlaws alive nets you more money than if they're dead but it gets hard to keep them alive in certain situations. There IS an actual story and you progress from town to town, unlocking more ammo types and different outlaws.Plays great, looks great, good story too. Worth every penny.			",122,83,0,18,19,1,14

												Out of alle the Oddworld games, Strangers Wrath was always the one I overlooked. Didn't have an original Xbox back in the day and when they released the HD version it was riddled with hella bugs. But now I finally gave it a whirl!Strangers Wrath is a unique blend of 3rd person platforming and 1st person shooting. Most of the game evolves around bountyhunting outlaws, those little bossfights give you room for lethal and even nonlethal approaches which you'll want to do to earn more moolah. True to the universe, the world is hella ...odd, one cool aspect is that the ammo for your gun are living critters which you need to hunt to restock constantly. There are almost a dozen different critters to use to give room for the own preferred playstyle. The game never got boring, allthough the first half until a certain reveal might overstay its welcome a little bit. But what happens leading up to the games end is ridiculous and definitely worth seeing.As expected and reported numerously, Strangers Wrath HD comes with some hefty technical shortcomings. This is as barebones as a PC port can get, I had to fiddle with graphical settings for almost half an hour until I had no strange FPS problems or weird bugs like my character not being able to move forward (Tip: turn vsync on!). There is controller support but it's not good, the game lets you rebind all the buttons but prompts show up as JOY1, JOY2. Fortunately the keyboard+mouse controls are totally fine and give benefits when aiming in first person mode.Strangers Wrath is a really really cool game which combines 3rd person and 1st person action unlike anything I've seen before and ultimately -considering it's over 10 years old at this point- left me very impressed. The world and its characters are exactly what you expect when Lorne Lanning gets to work his magic. Speaking of which, he really should make a new game!			",262,56,12,19,14,4,19

												After the apparent shortcomings of Munch's Oddesy, the Oddworld crew wisely decided to invest in creating a new hero for the franchise, something that was fresh and fit well into the 3D scene. Abe never felt like he fit in with a 3D platformer and with Munch being tied to Abe... Stranger was a good alternative to explore Oddworld in a 3D envrioment. It was a risk; and one that payed off in aces. It introduces gameplay mechanics and an immersive story that devs struggle, more often then not, fail in leaps to pull off today. You hunt your bounties with live ammo and it's up to you to decide how to do it, or If you want to chuck the bounties in the slammer or get rid of them for good. The more useful ammo, such as bolimites, fuzzles and chipmunks come up quite freqnetly and is often high in the ammo department, while some of the more damaging creatures are rare. The game does push you towards getting the enemies alive through the abundant ammo of that nature and higher payout, but it's also often a lot harder for that route. Which makes two distinct playstyles and either way, you need to get creative. Bosses are often tough, and require good knowledge of your ammo in order to capture them alive. With the game itself out of the way, lets talk about the port.Many people have seen issues with performance, on my 7970, it runs well and I've never seen a problem. BUT. you need to check if it will run. there are some demanding features, such as grass, which will have in game implications if you're forced to disable them as you might not have any idea you can hide over there for example. The achievements in this game are also borked. they will not save progress if you quit. that is to say, you will bounty 250 bad guys and you won't get rewarded for it unless you either play the game for long enough to get it; or you save and farm quick loads so you can bounty one or two idiots over and over.

At the end of the game they hinted a sequel but that vanished without a trace. I would pay 80$ to play the next game!9/10 Story is amazing, gameplay lacks and massive bugs for some usersI'm just going to point out some of the bugs.When i got farther into the game everytime i died the game would crash, no corrupted files atleast, but it got very VERY annoying.When i used to play this game on my old laptop it would crash every 5 minutes, BEWARE low-end pc users.it might just be my computer but it feels very un-optimized and unstable.Happy gaming			",179,23,4,22,17,1,5

												Stranger’s Wrath is a really fun and unique FPS/platformer with a great atmosphere. Instead of guns The Stranger uses a crossbow that fires animals and each animal gives you different ways to approach enemies. The difficulty on Normal is actually well balanced, it’s not punishing but you need to play smart. This falls apart in the last section in the game with a stupid difficulty spike where you have to escape an area before it explodes and right after that is a boss fight with two minibosses that can infinite you to death. I did beat the game but because of this I suggest playing on Easy and save yourself some headache.People seem to have some trouble with crashes and the like, but I didn’t run into any. (Though it still is pretty un-optimized because running on high anti-aliasing drags the FPS down.) Overall though despite any flaws Stranger’s Wrath is a fun game. ",218,242,2,31,19,2,23

This is a game that has given inspiration to many developers and I don't know of any other game that uses live animals as ammunition. This is the game that made me try out Steam and I think it is a game that everyone should try. Its ridiculous and the controls are a bit buggy the characters are very unusual and cartoonish which shows some real thought on the game developers part.

												Ok so first off, BEST FPS I'VE EVER F**KING PLAYED. I played this game as a kid, and i loved it. I think i fell in love with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover! anyways, onto the actual review...""You're the Stranger, a mysterious bounty hunter on a mission to bag the ultimate prize. And you need that money like no one else because there is something very wrong with your health and the only way to fix it is a very costly operation."" Ok so having that goal of (oh no massive spoilers...) 20,000 moolah (yes thats the currency, and yes I know thats epic...) means that you have to resort to becoming a bounty hunter. Now you may think that sounds pretty cool, but think again... it's even better then you could have ever wanted! you are equipped with the Critter Crossbow, (and again it's as epic as it sounds) a crossbow that fires live ammunition, i.e Zappflies, Thudslugs, Stingbees and more! (i think the names are fairly self explanitory there) So equipped with this ammo you set off claiming bounties and slowly earning moolah... but then some stuff happens that if I told you would be incredibly huge spoilers so i won't tell you about them. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who even just vaugly likes FPS games.10/10, would run around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animal again.			",125,17,5,9,6,1,10

												Having played this game as a child, replaying it was an interesting experience.The gameplay is unique, with the 2nd/3rd person combination and the 'live' munitions concept, although the whole 'run around and bounty some dude' that makes up the first half of the game feels stale after a while, but it is definately bareable and countered by the variety in environments and various enemy boss fights, which are all individually memorable.The plot and dialogue is actually quite good, it caught me off guard with its witty humour, charm and twists.The graphics in this HD update are reasonable given the games age.The music is a little scarce but fairly fitting for the environment, but the sounds used are something i really couldnt stand. NPCs often repeat quotes over and over again, and weapon noises are the same, making for a frustrating and annoying experience occasionally, most noticable the later portions of the game. The game itself is actually fairly short, being a linear action/adventure game, i finished it up in about 10 hours on hard, and it doesnt offer a tonne of replayability outside of steam achievements, and i noted a problem with the steam achievement system and the games save system with collectables.The game is fairly short, but its definately an entertaining blast and rewarding and memorable to playthrough.

You play as a guy named ""The Stranger"" who needs ""moolah"" (money) for an important operation. This game is Wild West themed, which means that the best way for you to make money is to collect bounties for cash. So you're a bounty hunter, collecting the biggest bad guys in the area. You get more money for capturing them alive than you do dead, and the best part is that even the minions can be cashed in.You don't fire guns though. Instead, you are armed with a dual fire crossbow that uses live bait as it's ammo. There are spiders that act as your lasso, bats that act like grenades, bees that act like machine gun rounds, and much more. It's a pretty cool take on the western theme.The world is filled with weird creatures instead of people too. You're some weird like guy that looks like no one else around, the major towns are filled with chicken people (they are really annyoing and have very cliche lines), there are weird native people that are like 2 feet tall, and then there are the bad guys which basically are all the same looking.It's cheesy, weird, annoying at times, but somehow still fun. Definitely an older game. If you can stomach this kind of stuff, it might just be a game for you. My advice if you can't decide whether or not to buy it, find some videos or pictures online of the game and get this game for cheap (like $5).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. A fantastic blend of a platformer and an FPS, set in a beautiful landscape populated with quirky characters. Cool storytelling and fun combat. A wonderful adventure. 11/10			",499,106,7,26,19,4,41

												One of my favorite games of all time. An incredible amount of love and thought went into this, and it's immediately apparent. The originality, humor, gameplay, and meaningful undertones all come together to form an unforgettable experience.This game is simply... fun(ny). You can listen in on the hilarious dialogue of any character, laugh at the attention-♥♥♥♥♥ chipmunk farting on your crossbow and being ""allergic to your ugliness"", lose yourself in Michael Bross' amazing soundtrack, appreciate the truly unique design and setting, punch complacent chickens in the face and steal their money, notice the parallels between harmonious peoples being subverted by industrialism and a people out of allignment with nature; the list goes on. The gameplay is intense and both 1st and 3rd-person views are fluid and change seamlessly. The animal-ammo system is as awesome as it is funny, with each animal serving a specific purpose so you have a lot of options on how you defeat your enemies.Being an Oddworld game, the humor is what you'd expect... It's ♥♥♥♥in' hilarious! There's a lot of unabashed humor and when you really listen to lots of characters, things get funnier. I've never laughed so much from somebody saying ""I like oatmeal"" before. Oddworld's humor always makes me happy, and games that make you laugh this much are doing something very right! It's just so entertaining.Is it original? Well just look at a few screenshots of the game and you'll see there isn't anything out there like it. The characters are interesting, and Stranger (the one you play as) is pretty badass. The environments and music combine to create an other-worldy feel, different yet similar to the previous games, but still of it's own. Originality is an Oddworld staple.The story is good, but I don't want to reveal anything so I'll just say it has heavy environmental undertones. It's in no way preachy, but the connections between native peoples being killed off by a more powerful and ""civilized"" culture is definitely there, and it makes you think. This is a fictionized example of a very real and re-occuring issue in humanity. To me this is the icing on the cake, because not only is this a great game but it promotes a more positive and sustainable direction for humanity; living in harmony with nature and not against it. Since this game has so much sentimental value to me, I don't see many downsides, but other people might. If you're not invested in the story or experience then you might feel the gameplay style gets repetitive, but I think if you invest yourself in it, you'll find more than enough to keep you entertained throughout the game. Just pay attention to some of the aspects of the game mentioned above and hopefully you love it! It doesn't have much replay value unless you find each playthrough a novel and enjoyable experience. If yous liked what ya read, or feel like punching open a stall door and beating a Wolvark to death with your face while he's taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'd probably like this game, ya punkass. I knows I do.

												Strangers Wrath is an interesting game to say the least. It's an FPS platformer that switches regularly from first and third person. What's unique about the game is the main character doesn't use guns. Instead the player uses a crossbow that fires small animals known as ""critters"" that do specific effects on enemies. As a result the game is a lot more stealth based then one might expect from such a title.That isn't to say it's not without it's flaws. It's fairly obvious early on that the game was designed with a child focus. The voice acting is fairly uninteresting and all the characters are portrayed as stereotypical caricatures of typical Old West characters. However it is a very well polished game, especially with it's HD re-release on Steam. Just remember it was originally exclusively an xbox game and as such wasn't designed to use a keyboard. I recommend using a gamepad as a result just so the Third person to first person jumps don't throw you off balance.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

You can go the non-lethal approach which nets you more Bounty. Afterall you're a Bounty Hunter. Worth the purchase.			",255,23,1,33,3,0,5

												I never got to play this on the original Xbox, so I am playing without nostalgia-vision. But I must say, this game is a quirky, unique fun experience. It mixes elements of FPS, third-person platforming, stealth, and action into a different and fun game.  I love the idea of the live ammunition, and each kind proves its uses in different situations. The game adds different elements of play as you progress, adding more thought and fun to the mix.Visually, the game looks pretty good. It's not state of the art graphics, but for a remastered og Xbox game, it looks pretty damn good. Story-wise, Stranger's Wrath has an interesting story about a seemingly selfish protagonist that sees its plot thicken. What really brings the game together is it's Western-style setting. Oddworld is a very fitting name for the setting, but it's a cool one. All in all, Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is a unique genre-bender that proves that other devs should take the risk once in awhile and break the standard format when it comes to making games. And the current sale price makes it a steal! Definitely worth adding to your library.			",32,9,0,16,9,1,18

												A timeless game. I have loved it since it was released and I still love it now. I noticed some issues with acheivements, however. I ran the game on hard-mode, but It only game me the ""Easy"" completion achievement, when really it shoudl've given me all 3 for Easy, Normal and Hard. Frankly, that is the only negative thing I have to say. This game is absolutely amazing, and I don't think I'll ever find a game with such an amazing plot, imaginitive stucture and innovative mechanical design.If you are looking for a game that brings something new to the table, to be unalike any other you have played before, with a rich and full story mode experince, absolutely pick up this game. It Is worth every penny.			",8,1,0,0,1,0,0

												This game is with out a doubt the most unique in the Oddworld Franchise, mainly because your not some weak alien  slave trying to free everything in site,in this game your a powerful badass named stranger,which I find to be a more developed and badass charecter than the previous games main charecters.Also this game is so high def that you probably couldn't even tell this was an hd remastering of an xbox game, the graphics hold up well from a game from 2005.Now the gameplay is pretty fun you go around in a western type enviroments collecting bountys for some town full of idiotic birds,the missions do get repitive a bit but, the use of oddworlds unique wild life as ammo,from the flesh terring fuzzle, to bats that explode,and spiders that tie your enemies up in a pinch, these ammo items are just enough to keep the game fresh, its always unique to find a new ammo type and have stranger say some stupid one liner.The  main aspect gameplay is just a hybrid of first person shooting and third person platforming, which are both fun to play in, I especially love it when stranger starts running like a cat/dog.The Voice acting for this game is amazing with such tallent as Lorne Lanning as stranger and various charecters with some charecters potrayed by different people, this also is what makes an oddworld game great.I give this game 10/10 Fuzzles.

												IMHO the most underrated Oddworld game out there - I played this game on the original xbox when I was maybe 12-13? Who'da thunk it I'd play it now when I'm 21 years old and still love it just as much as I did back in the day. Aside from the nostalgia factor it really is still a beautiful looking, smooth playing game. You don't just hunt your bountys, but your ammunition as well, giving a whole new meaning to the term FPS.  Laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off when I played it ages ago and still laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off playing it today, I could reecomend this to anyone, you really can't go wrong for 10 moolah, and I'm guessing it will be on sale a few times being an older game and all. By all means pardner start hunting them bountys gettin' that moolah.PS - the fuzzles might look cute but... don't try and pet them			",110,34,1,13,7,0,2

												This game is bizzare and heart-warming. I'm a huge fan of Oddworld already, but I strangly never picked this up. I regret it though because I would've been playing it still today. It is so different from it's predecessors.You collect different types of critters for ammo that each have different effects on your enemies. You can play stealthy or go in crossbow a-blazin'! It's pretty challenging on hard difficulty. The HD edition improves on the original game's visuals, and actually looks really friggin' good for a 2005 video game.

												An Action/Adventure/FPS hybrid from the developer Oddworld Inhabitants and published by Electronic Arts, Stranger's Wrath was a new direction for a franchise which had traditionally consisted of macabre puzzle games starring the character Abe.Stranger's Wrath takes place in a western-inspired world where you play as ""The Stranger"", a bounty hunter who must collect enough money for a life-saving operation via capturing outlaws.What makes this game unique is it's combination of the first and third-person perspectives which gives an interesting opporitunity to combine precise 3D-platforming and first-person gunplay via the use of a crossbow. Instead using conventional ammunition, you collect ""live ammunition"". Small animals that you capture which carry a range of different effects from provoking an enemy to a more convenient location, to blowing them to smithereens.Overall it's a great game which is too often brushed over, and easily worth your time should you have cash to spare.

												Very awesome, classic game. Very original ideas for the weapon and weapon types. I love it so far and I know it is going to continue to be awesome. Besides a little stuttering that happens sometimes I think only when going to a new area (might be something to do with texture loading), it runs flawlessly at 60fps at 1920x1080, controls are super smooth, and the game is outrageously fun. One of my favorite new games that I wish I would have played a long time ago. I stole this game at $2.50.8.5/10Note:I read through most of the negative reviews and saw that a lot of people have performance issues and crashes, and some can't even play past the intro. I am sorry for their luck because this game is really great. They are probably having problems because they use Windows 7 still or something, I'm not sure. I can report that it runs fine with no crashes for me on a i7 3820 @ 3.6ghz, 16gb ram, gtx 970, windows 10 pro.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												I cautiously recommend this game.It's obviously a very big departure from previous games in the series. No followers to rescue, no puzzles to solve, instead it's a surprisingly successful mix of FPS combat and third person action. The first-person third-person mix works really well and the controls are quite good (I played with an xbox controller). The combat can get a bit tedious at points, but overall it works.However the biggest problem of the game is this: the story establishes very early on that your character needs to save up a lot of money. At the same time it throws a bunch of upgrades at you which collectively take a huge chunk out of your wallet. So I ended up ignoring upgrades for a while because it was looking like it was going to take a serious amount of time to save up that much. But here's the thing: you don't need to save any money at all. Luckily I got sick of saving up and Googled it, but I can't even imagine how frustrating it would be to save up for two thirds of the game, skipping many useful upgrades, only to find out that it was pointless.This is such an obvious design flaw, I don't know how they left it in the game.

												A short, glib review. The problems with the game are relatively few. The movement controls in 3rd person can be clunky. There is a level toward the game's end that is confusingly difficult, and frankly sucked to play over and over again. It is a timed escape sequence with what seemed to be 30 seconds of grace time before it became unwinnable.The story is well done. It was understated at some points though, if only because it reveals things from the get-go. Delightfully quirky and quite charming. The ending was pleasant, too.Mechanically interesting, especially for the game's age, letting the player screw with the enemy AI in a number of different ways.Not my favorite game, but it will be worth remembering, which made it worth playing.

												Nice scenario, good controls for ported game, western atmosphere and humor.WARNING: This game need to run on LOWEST game settings including your graphic card control, otherwise game unplaylable cause of freezes every 3-4 secs. And level with sprint for time can't be loaded during game, cause some errors in game (need quit game if your hero feels to die and load game from main menu) - game just freezes and dont answer on anything.

Not a review of the port itself. I was very fortunate in being able to have a rig which supported a smooth port experience. However, there were still occasional visual glitches and the game crashed every time after I died during the last few segments of the game. So even at its best performance the game runs only adequately.I wish I could say I enjoyed this game more. The most creative aspect of the game is using the creature ammos to capture or kill enemies. This dead or alive bounty hunting mechanic is the core of the gameplay, but it barely gets developed upon after its introduced, and what's worse is that they ditch several mechanics after the halfway point of the game. The game can be played in the 3rd as well 1st person perspective, but all the 3rd person perspective is for is very basic 3rd person platforming and combat, as well as traversing the levels faster. The game has a currency which the plot informs the player is very important, motivating the player to capture more enemies than they kill. This makes for interesting gameplay, as it takes longer and is more risky to capture enemies alive than it is to kill them, but alive enemies pay out more. The earlier levels are also built around a combination of stealth and cover, which combined with the creative crossbow tools, gives the play options in how to complete a level. There are also upgrades and ammo to buy, giving you more to do with your money.Without spoiling anything, about half-way through the game money stops mattering, your upgrades stop mattering and capturing enemies alive doesn't really make a difference anymore. This is a problem as multiple of the player's tools is built around distracting and stunning enemies as well as killing them. The dead or alive element goes out the window, and the game becomes a very generic console fps, complete with parking garage level design. It feels like the game ran short of time or budget and lost everything which made the game unique as a fps.Overall the game is enjoyable but bland. I would ultimately say that the game is average, but since I can only recommend or not recommend a game, I can't really recommend an average game when there are already so many good to excellent games to play on steam, especially in this genre. For Oddworld fans I would say its worth at least a single playthrough, just so you can have experienced another aspect of the Oddworld universe. As a fan of the first two games on the playstation I was dissapointed that not as much of the same atmosphere was found in this game, although that might be a consequence of the xbox graphics still not being able to provide the same amount of detail as the prerendered environments of Oddysee and Exoddus.FPS fans can pass on this game, but Oddworld fans should see this game through at least once. That's assuming of course they can get this port to work, since it is infamously unstable. Otherwise skip this port and find it on the original xbox.			",74,4,0,4,4,0,1

												Bought the original on the original Xbox, the remake on PS3, and last time it came on sale, the remake here too. Fantastic game.  Especially considering it`s age.  Really wish they`d make something like this again.All ranged combat is first person, and melee can be either first or third person.  Semi open world, and nice environments throughout.  Neat inertia system for your character movement.  Enemy variety is pretty low, but it doesn't really detract from the game.  Ability to choose between live or dead capture is a nice feature on bounties.  Story is decent.			",224,33,4,15,8,4,5

												The game crashed constantly for me, forcing multiple restarts in order to progress at all.  It seemed that everytime the Steam overlay would pop with an achievement or notification, the game would freeze.  Graphically, it's better than the prior installments, but you'll only get to enjoy them for about 10 minutes at a time before it crashes.  Avoid this buggy mess.			",283,69,3,22,10,2,14

												This game aged like Milk.Stranger's Wrath has a concept that on paper and for a 15 dollar purchase seems like a fun experience. Shoot critters instead of guns, set traps, hunt for outlaws. Sounds fun right?The execution is unforchanately poorly implemented. The game suffers from hit detection errors and missing sound effects. A first person shooter requires precise aim and I never felt like my shot was quite hitting the mark, I found myself clipping into walls frequently which is especially annoying when being pelted with bullets and trying to take cover. I spent the second half of the game being unable to hear Stranger speak and having his punch attack missing its sfx. The last third of the game becomes a monontus mess that I felt obligated to finish to justify my purchase. Go into an area, kill everyone, rinse repeat. The semi final boss has got to be some of the worst game design I've ever seen. Being webbed up and continously stun locked isn't fun or interesting as a boss fight, it's just frustrating. I remember really loving this game as a child on Xbox, but I see that was also just another case of nolstalgia glasses. This port is garbage, and the game hasn't aged gracefully. Watch it on youtube.			",36,2,0,2,1,0,0

												A ""so bad it's good"" game. I got to a point where I encountered an unbeatable mini-boss and rage uninstalled.I was looking for charming and unconventional yet got outdated and tedious. The different weapon types were fun for a while, but the rinse-and-repeat level design and same-old-same-old ""bounties"" got really old. Plus, the last stages seemed so far removed from the original Western theme of the game that it was almost like two different design teams just spliced a game together. Think the Borderlands world without the fun.I could only recommend this game if you're feeling nostalgic and want to play something that was originally released on the first Xbox in 2005. Thankfully, games have evolved since then and there are tons of better titles to play these days.			",78,9,0,2,1,0,2

												An interesting hybrid between FPS and platforming which is a risky move considering Oddworld have only ever done platforming, but their own humour comes into it and using insects and small animals as ammunition is always funny. You have many RPG elements with upgrading weapons, health and so on by buying stuff from the store and getting far more money from catching the person alive rarther than dead.I highly recommend this to any fan of the oddworld series. Not yet seen the end, but it is an amazing game that I've had trouble to stop playing.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												Stranger's Wrath, well, were do I begin. I'd like to point out that because this is an HD remake that the graphics and sound are fantastic, but what about the game. Well, you learn early in the game that the protaginist bounty hunter, Stranger, has an urgent medical problem that needs to be taken care of, otherwise he will die, but the procider will cost 20,000 mullah(and in the game not only will u receive at most 500-1000 mullah at max from bounty hunting, u are constantly buying upgrades(unless u want to cheat by constantly beat up the towns-folk))(not to mention that the only resemblense to the other oddworld games with this one is Vlukkons and the Glukkons(yep, not even the Mudokuns apear in this installment,but it doesnt matter)), so Stranger is forced to do more bounties. Thats all I'll say about the story. The gameplay is also fantastic due to the genuies 1st/3rd person style gameplay with the Critter Lancher, one of the best weapons in gaming history due to fact that it can lanch any critter Stranger can fit on the hand crossbow and use them as ammo(the lightning bugs are the only critters that u use to farm critters and also have an unlimited ammo). The other elements are also done very well, as how you have to capture enemies and bounty people alive to get a lot more profit(its the dead profit times by high timing numbers like 5 or 4 or 3 or even 6). I dont know what else to say, get the game in the Oddbox(since buying the game by itself is stupid, seeing the Oddbox is 10 USD and Stranger's Wrath by itself is 10 USD), and play this magnificent game as well as the others now!

												Fun game, the way you can kill or capture enemies is done in a cool way. Same goes for the ammo you collect; you use creatures instead of bullets. How awesome is that ? The game has an open world feel to it, but it's not. It just gives you the illusion that it is. Anyway, you do quests and they mostly end up with you having to capture or kill a boss, along with their henchman. This is a port from the Xbox version but all things considered, it still looks pretty good. Sound is also good and as you can tell the gameplay is still nice and fresh. By the way, the company that released this version will also release a HD patch later this year, so things will definately look sharper then (and, if I recall correctly, models will also be updated). But I recommend you buy it, HD patch or not.[Rating: 86/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

The weapons are intresting, you use live ammo to kill/bate/capture enemies. It's very short and there is not much replay value maybe 6-8 first time, it's very linear but keeps you on your toes.Pro: Fun, Fast paced, Intresting and unique story and gameplay.Con: Short and not much replay value.

												You know, it's sad really. I really wanted to like this game due to the creative weapons, location, and characters, but there is one HUGE issue with this game that kills any enjoyment: It is the most poorly opitimized game I have ever played. It's main issue is that the game will constantly crash at random intervals (sometimes after 2 minutes of gameplay). I'm still stuck on the first level thanks to those crashes! As for the controls, it's the same issue, but I can look past that. I can even look past some graphical issues (including one odd one where if you take a screenshot, it does a weird duplication to said screenshot). What I can't look past is the constant crashes and poor optimization. Heck, the developer of the port is doing nothing to fix the game! For as much as I wanted to like and recommend this game, I sadly can not. AVOID THIS GAME and pick it up on the original Xbox instead! It's better optimized, runs better, and is dirt cheap!

												There's a few people having issues with this game crashing on them. Seems to be due to multicore processors, from what the forums say. I would be one of those people. Had it where every time I would launch the game, as soon as I stepped on the first marker at the beginning the game would crash. This occurred no matter what options I set the game to, and I'm not about to go messing with my BIOS for a game. On top of all this, the devs don't seem too interested in even so much as responding to customers about how to go about fixing this. Sent them an email regarding the issue almost a month ago and never received a response back. Seems as though they've abandoned any support for this game whatsoever. You're better off getting the game on mobile, as they've at least responded right away after I accidentally emailed the mobile devs.			",315,58,2,44,24,3,60

												This is a REALLY good game. The story is fairly simple. You are the stranger. An alien with a serious medical problem that is very expensive to fix. To fix it you need to get a LOT of money, and you do this by hunting down enemies Boba Fett style. This is probably the best Bounty Hunter game ever made. Capturing crooks and using skill to take them alive rather than dead is one of those things you'll feel really good about. Mind you, the game drowns you in money, so you can easily get all the upgrades without capturing the crooks alive and all that. (Probably for the best.) It easily combines first person shooting with strategy, platforming, and you need ALL of that together to beat this game. Because it doesn't pull it's punches. It's not Dark Souls hard, but it's one of those games where you need to think under heavy fire, and capturing all the bad guys alive is a challenge, but a good one. At around 60% completion, the gameplay changes a bit. Accompanied by a solid, if kinda predictable twist if you've been paying attention. (Though I still did a little gasp.) Bounty Hunting and money collection becomes pointless, so you might as well collect all the upgrades and not worry about saving up for later. Overall, I give the game a 9/10. It's amazing. Beautiful. Solid and unforgettable. But there isn't much replay content unless you want to try and capture enemies alive if you failed the first time. And a few hidden collectables. (Also some sections, especially a timed one at the very end that is VERY unforgivng, can be overwhelmingly difficult.)Play the game. It's a very solid port (I had no problems with it, but I've heard others have. So probably give it some research first.)			",130,14,1,6,2,1,3

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Third/First Person Action AdventureThe Good:+ The game certainly is original in terms of its character, world and story. + Game controls between first and third person and does a great job switching between the two. Third person is mostly used for traversing the environments while first person is used for the crossbow to kill/capture enemies. + The premise is simple, but nicely executed. You collect a bounty and then proceed to go hunt it down, usually with a lot of enemies and obstacles along the way. The game is linear and you can only hunt one bounty at a time but each bounty is unique in its own way.+ Each bounty is unique, like a mini boss battle, each one requires special tactics. You can either kill or capture the enemies. Killing enemies is easier but nets you less money while capturing them is the opposite.+ Use money to upgrade your character+ Unique ammo, your crossbow can hold two types of ammo at one time. The Average:Graphically the game is decent, it certainly isn't ugly but nothing really stands out. The story while decent feels like it never meets its potential. It's hard to care about the main character, villains or anybody else. The Bad- Broken Achievements, exiting the game makes you lose your achievement progress. - I really hated the voice acting. - Game crashes after every death and load in the second half of the game. A reoccurring problem for many users with no fix in sight, making the game almost unplayable. I solution is to quit the game before you die and continue from the main menu. Conclusion:For some reason this game reminds of me of a Rare game back in the day. Animals that talk with cute fuzzy ammo to collect. A fun game with some serious technical issues that should be fixed. Given the age of the game its surprisingly holds up pretty decently.   ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

Sadly, to this day, i never happened to play it for more than 10 minutes without a crash.Excelent game, but terrible port.The J.A.W dev probably just spilled water all over this to make a good use of its name.

												Well, in Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, you play as a certain bad♥♥♥♥♥bounty hunter called the Stranger. He is SO BAD♥♥♥♥♥because he enters towns full of civilian poultry to whom he can MURDER as he pleases. As he commits genocidical acts upon various towns in this fugkeen MASSIVE world right, he opens his fat mouth and utters a cheesy kick-ARSEEE one-liner in his deep lobotomized vocal features. One of which you should tell the grandkids;""In 30 seconds you'll be dead, and I'll blow this place up and be home in time for Corn Flakes"" ~ Stranger, 1816 ",263,16,6,14,13,2,24

												let me start out by saying that I love this game and the oddworld franchise as a whole. with that being said, this port is garbage. I can run games far more demanding than this one with no issues, and there ARE no issues until the game decides to crash for no damn reason. it's horribly ironic that a game company called ""just add water"" made this port that numerous people have had debilitating problems with since its inception. luckily I only paid $3 for the oddboxx on sale, but I still paid for it. this would be acceptable if it was a torrent from a sketchy website, but this is a purchase I made from steam. take out the trash, guys. no one should have to pay for a lazy, broken port from an amateur ish company that doesn't do oddworld inhabitants justice. if you care about your customers, prune the trees they eat from.

												Loved the original, but after some recent issues, I'm starting to hate this remake.It ran fine for most of the story, but now it crashes every single time I die, the controls randomly freak out leaving me frozen in place flailing like a crazy person, and it just deleted my most recent autosave (making me lose 20-30min of progress) and started an autosave from a new game.

I highly reccomend this game especially if you want a break from the casual FPS games of our time. It has great graphics, especially for the time of its original release.

												Stranger's Wrath HD is a great remastered game. It's not just a last gen game that has been upscaled for higher resolution, the character models have been remade from the ground up and the environment have more art assets, looking astonishing compared to the Original Xbox. The story is about a Steef named Stranger, set in the Oddworld universe, who is in desperate need for an operation, in which he became a bounty hunter to catch criminals to cash them in to meet his requirements to get it. Gameplay wise is a mixture between 3rd person platforming which also focus more on fighting and using agility, and a 1st person shooter in which you can switch views anytime seamlessly with a touch of a button/key. Instead of typical guns, you are equipped with a crossbow and you use live ammunition in which you can either buy in game or hunt for them. There are now a bit more features compared to its original release, such as unlocking concept art, new easter eggs, and select difficulties. Fan of Oddworld games and newcomers should definitely pick this game up!!!			",189,12,0,11,3,1,17

Everything... everything could possibly go wrong. This port is by far the worst game I have ever played! Sorry I should correct myself. This port is by far the worst game I have ever TRIED to play. That's right, I couldn't even get 10 seconds in the game before it crashes on the LOGO!!No fixesNo workaroundsThis is such a huge waste of my money.

												Surprisingly a great ""Oddworld"" game, I said that in quotations because I was expecting this to be a departure of what makes Oddworld's storyline great.It starts off cowboy-ish, but it does eventually grab that Oddworld feel in the story and scenery.The gameplay itself is also great, it is not a generic FPS. You dont just get guns that hurts people, you get ammo types that knocks enemies downs or wrap them up, and you're rewarded for ""capturing"" enemies rather than killing them which I think makes for interest tactics on overcoming the enemies.Lots of PC port problems though. Lots of people reports crash, but the big problem for me was frequent framerate problems, would drop to the 30s sometimes. I think running in Windows 7 fixed the problem, but some weather effects will bring it down.			",698,74,19,46,23,7,67

												I wish this game had a little more work to it and it could have been a new conkers bad fur day but just falls short of that. still a very good game just made me want more.the gameplay is very repeative till the last area as its mostly pick a bounty and go through the mobs to get to the boss but the last mission is more like an actually story mode and was pretty fun. The story needed some work as it was a good one but the characters didn't have any personallity to them. The voice acting and everything was great but ith one or two more writers on staff this game would have been 5/5, spirit sucessor to conker but just falls short as the story doesn't come in till the end and the gameplay was semi repeative but was so a lot of fun.

												I remember playing this on Xbox a long time ago and absolutely loved it. So when it came to PC, it was really a no-brainer that I wanted to show support and pick it up again. I was a little bothered by some of the controls for PC and didn't play for a while.HOWEVER, somewhere down the line, the game was patched and it added a few nice little options to the PC port. And it is now completely and competently playable without a gamepad! It's still just as beautiful as a decade ago, when I first delved into Oddworld!			",288,86,2,61,18,3,16

												The game that is so good for the first 2/3 of the game that it makes you want to buy an original Xbox for. Then it remembers its an odd world game and needs more oppression and social commentary. Shift isn't bad in a game play perspective, just refinement of a system to cut out the middleman.

												I played the living hell out of this game on the original Xbox, it was FANTASTIC! And the game itself is.HOWEVER, Sadly this port of the game is amongst the worst damned ports in PC history,I am running this game on a GTX 770 and it frequently drops below 30 FPS, and this is on LOW settings.Try turning AA on, even the most basic form of it and the game suddenly runs at a nice and steady 4 fps, good! I wanted the game to be more like a slideshow anyway.The keyboard and mouse controls are just terrible so if you're going to pull yourself through this you better have a controller ready and even then things are very very sluggish and being precise with your aim is impossible, for those of you who did not know this game features an FPS mode where you launch various critters at your enemies to cause various effects, you also need to go hunting for these critters to refill your ammo, these guys are tiny, like, TINY, and in order to refill your ammo you need to hit these buggers whilst they're running around on the ground.It's impossible, sometimes I have to shoot 3-4 times before hitting the damned things whilst standing still and this is only when using the controller, using the mouse however it is just fine but good luck walking around using WASD.. So I guess I'll just walk with my controller and aim with the mouse, good!Let's talk about V-Sync, everyone who knows anything about PC gaming knows that Vsync can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥, I personally prefer to always turn it of since I have a high-end enough PC to run mostly anything without any hitches and hey, this game is from 2005, not a problem right? Well I couldn't tell you, because this game comes bundled with glitches, buggs and errors up the wha-zoo including this one wonderfull bug I call V♥♥♥♥♥♥If you disable V-sync, it disables character movement in the game.Alright I'll let you think about that for a moment, and no this is not something isolated to my system.Turning V-SYNC OFF... Turns of... Character movement? That's right! So ♥♥♥♥ you for even trying to turn it of, why did we even put the option in there? Because we wanted you to know this OUR game and we don't give no ♥♥♥♥♥.Oh and do you have an AMD graphics card? You won't be running this game, at all. So have fun staring at a black screen.I picked this game up quite recently and upon being struck with the glitch-fest that this piece of crap is I started googling around for fan-made patches and fixes seeing as the JAW company obviously gives no ♥♥♥♥♥, there are none, and I came across this brilliant little article from Giant Bomb.http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/blazehedgehog/blog/the-odd-tale-of-why-you-shouldnt-buy-strangers-wra/94292/This is where my mind was truly blown, this game used to be even MORE BROKEN THAN THIS? I don't even..Dear Just Add Water ( The people who ported this game to PC )Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ seriously this is unplayable.Want to play this game? Do! it is an absolutely fantastic title, just go pick it up on Ebay for eight bucks, that's even cheaper than this broken mess and you're going to have a much better time.			",168,24,1,22,8,1,12

												[size=+2]OddWorld: Stranger's Wrath HD: Review[/size]The Oddworld studios is a great studio that makes the game almost flawless this is the actual remake of the ""Stranger's Warth"" (the original version of the game was released to the XBOX only) to have better graphics and to be in multiple platforms such has Playstaion 3, PC, Android, IOS, Ouya and Playstation Vita.Well let's start with some aspects of the gameFirst stop OddWorld never released a game with the combat they literally just created ""OddWorld: Munch's Oddysee"" wich was the first OddWorld game that had a 3D animation with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera movement, carrying on Stranger's Wrath has a great camera movement, a good combat engine wich you can use the map and it's resources to do it stealth or go aggro all the enemies and hope you don't get killed, when I was playing the game I got really stealthy and decided to hunt the enemies one by one until I reached the boss and I was on hard mode so it literaly made my life easier I din't wasted a bunch of ammo and got captured the boss in ease, the only think I don't like in this game it's the short story it took me 16 hours to finsih the hole game in hard mode thats how short it is, and they are never making a new game about the legendary steed ""Stranger"" since they are focused giving a epileptic seizure to future generations with ""OddWorld: Abe's New 'N' Tasty"" and the up comming remake of ""OddWorld: Abe Exoddus"" wich will literaly make me epileptic (hope not, well they abuse in the lightning again) and forgot to metion that Oddworld was going to relase a game with engine of Stranger's Wrath but with a few changes called ""Oddworld: Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot"" got canceled due to the collapse of Oddworld Inhabitants, but has they got a new team now I know it will be released and people will love the studio wich I still love since I was a child.-----------------BUY THIS GAME GIVE SUPPORT TO THE ODDWORLD STUDIO!------------------			",42,5,0,3,2,0,2

Despite countless issues (crashing, lack of controller support, poor framerate, etc.), JAW has done nothing to patch out these issues.  They are very much capable of it.  The PS3 HD remake runs great, but the PC port is riddled with bugs.  Buyers beware.			",13,0,0,2,2,0,0

												Loved this on Xbox and wanted to feel that bite of nostalgia when buying this. However controls are horrible in PC version at least when playing with keyboard and mouse.  Who knows, maybe controller pad could solve the case.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember seeing all sorts of advertisments about this game that were so compelling and interesting back in middle school inside of a PC Gamer magazine. I also remembered all of my fond memories of the Odd World that's centralized around Abe. But this game just doesn't have the same sort of appeal -- especially since Abe's Odworld is sort of timeless and this one really isn't. It's dated. It's not really that fun at all. I regret the purchase.			",46,4,0,3,2,0,1

You of all studios should know better than this. This product is BROKEN. Lord knows why but the FPS.. no wait, I mean the seconds per frame is just abysmal, the textures and 3d work look like a leprous clown dropped in and smeared vaseline and poo all over everything before dropping a nuclear bomb loaded with photoshop's smear tool on everything just for good measure.Irony being i've heard this is actually a decent game and wanted to play it but couldn't because I didn't have any interest in getting an X-Box. I still can't play it because this diseased code-vomit they thought was anything other than an utter disgrace and embarrassment was worth pushing onto steam.I think I need to go take a shower to get the disgust off.

												I hate hate HATE that I am leaving a bad review for this game as it is an original Xbox classic, in my opinion. But, it didn't work on my laptop. My laptop is an Asus laptop that I am able to run Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas on near flawlessly (with low settings), but it couldn't run this game properly, which makes no sense to me. I even adjusted the settings before starting. Certain parts of the levels would turn completely black, making it nearly impossible to maneuver through the level. Because of that, my saves couldn't be loaded due them being ""damaged"".A lonely tear streamed down my cheek as I requested a refund :'(			",13,0,0,1,1,0,0

												Honestly this is probably the worst steam purchase I've even made. The game has been out for years and even though I've waited all this time for a patch, it's still unplayable due to it being a bad port job. Actually, it's become even worse somehow when they updated it to HD. I can't get the damn thing to run over 5 FPS even on the lowest settings and I am running the it on an intel i7 and a GTX 650 TI.I wish I could have returned this broken crap but I had the unfortuate luck of buying this abysmal port job before steam refunds was ever a thing.

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively. Gameplay: This was not my first time playing this game; in fact, this is my sixth time playing through the game, counting the five playthroughs I had of the Xbox version (also the game really can't do the ""Only on Xbox"" claim anymore, so that's kinda funny). I took a couple of years off from this game, since it was one of my yearly playthrough games, and coming back to it with both a new perspective and a new control scheme, this game is still as fresh as ever. It's a blend of FPS, stealth, and platforming that just works when it honestly shouldn't.The FPS elements can be very tactical in nature, with your main weapon being a crossbow that can hold two of nine available ammo types; each one having their own specific uses. You'll soon find the three or four that work for you and forget the rest, but again, that's not to say that they're useless. There does seem to be mouse smoothing and auto-aiming in this game, which can be distracting for some, but I never found it to be that big of a deal. They can be disabled, as far as I know. This game does have replenishing health, but it's different from how a Call of Duty game does it. You have a health and a stamina gague; the stamina gauge is replenished by either taking in enemies or standing still. Sprinting doesn't drain stamina, but it doesn't replenish it, either. You also use stamina to heal yourself, with a full stamina bar often recovering about 75% of your total health. There's a great deal of tactics to healing, with the choice oftentimes being made between ducking behind a wall or stunning everyone guns-a-blazing.Of course, another option is to stealth your way around areas, especially if there happens to be a very dense crowd of enemies. It's still recommended that you bag enemies, though, and it's all your choice how you tackle the areas. Your punch, if you've been upgrading it through the store, will most often knock out enemies in one hit. Goons and bosses have their own health and stamina gagues as well. Obviously, an alive baddie is worth more than a dead baddie, so do try to take 'em in alive. It is possible to take in every boss alive (some are pretty hard to do, though) with the exception of very late game bosses, but the stakes have changed at that point, and that's all I'll say on that.All in all, I didn't really have any issues with any of the areas, with the possible exception of the last bit before the final boss fight being one helluva difficulty spike. It's something that I can guarantee is different from anything you've played before, and even after six playthroughs, the game still feels fresh and juicy as ever. 10/10.Story: Man, this game has some great dialogue. It's easy to spend a while in towns just listening to what the Clakkerz have to say. The Grubs have some pretty great lines as well. Basically, there's a lot of lines in this game that'll almost assuredly get a laugh out of you if you even have a remotely crude sense of humor. The surprising bit is that the storyline actually gets good about 2/3 of the way through. That's not to say that the first 2/3 of the story are worth losing; it's just that the stakes become that much higher at that point. The ending is unexpectedly dramatic and actually really good. For a lot of great laughs and a surprisingly well-written story, I give the story a 9/10.Graphics: As expected from an HD port, the game looks great. One thing that I'm glad to have seen toned down from the Xbox version is the utterly absurd amount of bloom. Seriously, the amount of bloom in the Xbox version far surpassed any premise of artistic direction. Speaking of, the art direction of this game is absolutely fantastic; as to be expected from an Oddworld Inhabitants game. It's an excellent mix of high-tech gadgets and old-timey western aesthetics. The characters, enemies, ammo, areas... just everything looks fantastic. The technical aspects... aren't so fantastic. For starters, the game uses SSAA, which is HORRENDOUSLY inefficient. The game itself isn't too demanding, but the really weird part is that the game prefers my Integrated Graphics on my i5-3470. I could only really run it on 4x SSAA because of this (and yes, I did try and go through NVIDIA Control Panel; it didn't change anything). Even despite the not-so-great technical side of this game, the game still looks fantastic enough for me to give this game a 4/5 for graphics.Sound: Well, the music is pretty good. I always make the note as to whether or not I'd bring this along with me on my MP3 player, and I wouldn't really do that for this soundtrack, but there are some very good songs in there that fit the ""odd"" vibe this game is trying to pull. Voiceacting is great, with a lot of the humor coming from just the inflections that the voiceactors use. Again, it's hilarious how the Grubs seem to be speaking in all-caps. A rather disappointing aspect of the voiceacting, however, is that the voice clips are rather low-fidelity. I don't have the greatest audio equipment in the world (a Gamecom 777 headset into the included USB sound card) and I can hear the compression on the voice clips. It makes me sad. Surely they could've sourced some uncompressed master audio files or something? Because of this, I can't give the audio portion of the game a perfect, but I still feel alright giving it a 4/5.Overall scores are 10/9/4/4; 9.0/10. Despite not being the best coded port of all time, the gameplay is still very much worth your time and money.			",508,69,16,41,32,3,65

												Admittedly, the original port quality of the SD version (now unavailable, which is nice) was atrocious and in many instances completey unplayable. But with a massive failure comes the ability to learn from it, and JAW refined the port quality with the HD release. You'll find none of the original nonsense in this version, just a great game with that classic oddworld feel to it.As ""Stranger"" utilize living ammunition to dispatch your enemies. You can blow them up, fill them with holes, shred them apart or clobber them to death with certain projectiles, or you can go the quality bounty hunter route and take every outlaw you encounter in alive and roll in the sweet sweet moolah. You'll fight your way through farmlands, forests, ruins, facilities and now in beautiful HD, worthy of modern day screens. All the while, enjoying what is genuinely an instant classic and a worthy part of the Oddworld universe.			",134,17,1,28,8,2,21

I could only really run it on 4x SSAA because of this (and yes, I did try and go through NVIDIA Control Panel; it didn't change anything). Even despite the not-so-great technical side of this game, the game still looks fantastic enough for me to give this game a 4/5 for graphics.Sound: Well, the music is pretty good. I always make the note as to whether or not I'd bring this along with me on my MP3 player, and I wouldn't really do that for this soundtrack, but there are some very good songs in there that fit the ""odd"" vibe this game is trying to pull. Voiceacting is great, with a lot of the humor coming from just the inflections that the voiceactors use. Again, it's hilarious how the Grubs seem to be speaking in all-caps. A rather disappointing aspect of the voiceacting, however, is that the voice clips are rather low-fidelity. I don't have the greatest audio equipment in the world (a Gamecom 777 headset into the included USB sound card) and I can hear the compression on the voice clips. It makes me sad. Surely they could've sourced some uncompressed master audio files or something? Because of this, I can't give the audio portion of the game a perfect, but I still feel alright giving it a 4/5.Overall scores are 10/9/4/4; 9.0/10. Despite not being the best coded port of all time, the gameplay is still very much worth your time and money.			",508,69,16,41,32,3,65

												A great overlooked FPS/TPS that lets you take control of a bounty hunter looking for the next bounty to pay for his surgery that will save his life. It's a little iffy on the PC, having multiple bugs and minor performance issues, but if you didn't buy it on the XBox, then your should get it for the PC.			",184,14,5,10,10,1,6

												It's definitely an interesting game. There are some good and bad, but some of the bad is probably just personal preference, aside from an issue I will discuss later. The graphics seem very nice for an hd remake. Texture quality could be better, but I was satisfied with it. The gameplay was awkward but had a lot of potential. I just wish you didn't have to keep switching from first to third and back to shoot stuff or climb things(technically you don't switch into third person, it just automatically changes the camera to that while you climb).My only real issue with this game is that my framerate was abysmal, despite well exceeding the system recuirements. I had to play the game at almost minimal graphical settings to get a decent framerate. This should be kept in mind if you don't have the greatest computer and plan to buy this game. Otherwise, it's a good game if you're into a somewhat silly storyline and don't mind sub par dialogue.			",41,3,0,7,3,0,0

												When I originally played it on the xBox it was a great game that I remember very well. When I bought this it was for nostalgia but with the HD remake it felt almost like a new game but still had the same feel to it.In Stranger's Wrath you play a Bounty Hunter who is a stranger to all (Even the player). You use a variety of different insects to capture and hand in the bounty's. You have a choice to either jail them alive or hand in their dead corpses. Dead or Alive their coming with you...The game has an extreme sense of uniqueness using the First-Person shooting mechanic and third person parkour mechanic together in a surprisingly fitting fashion.Overall I'd reccommend this game for anyone who's a fan of the Oddworld series or just looking for something interesting.

												A departure from the original Oddworld titles, but comes into its own as a fantastically unique adventure game, mixing FPS and third person gameplay surprisingly well to balance out fast, in-your-face gunplay with slick, comfortable platforming and general world traversal relatively seamlessly.I can safely say I haven't played many games that wear as many hats as well as Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. The gameplay rocks, visuals are strange yet immersive, soundtrack is distinct and has some pretty great pieces, and the story is humorous while still managing to touch on some significant aspects of larger industrial expansion and what it does to the environment. I know that sounds preachy, but it's been a staple of the Oddworld franchise since the beginning, and every game does so just subtly enough to deliver a meaningful message through your struggle as the protagonist.Anyways, long story short, if you ever wanted a really weird Western, this is the best one you'll ever see. Now go trap some live ammo and hunt some goons!P.S. Lorne Lanning show us some more Oddworld bby pls.			",395,90,2,30,19,6,30

												A solid game which perfectly remains barely aged. The game highly encourages stealthy tactics to deal with enemies, but you can take them with all you have if you prefer. The game has that Oddworld flavor we love (Although a very few species from previous games make an appearance), and despite having just 3-4 voice actors is more than enough to characterize the cast.Now, i have various negatives about the game but they are minor and probably nitpicking. The plot is extremely minor and you won't know what's going on until very late in the game (There's a good quantity of foreshadowing though), and that hurt my interest in the game to get my full interest (Aside the Oddworld brand). The difficulty curve sometimes is out of place as some late bosses or areas can be taken down with ease but a few early ones or previous to those are overwhelming. (Minor spoiler) The game will make you think you need to achieve certain goals but suddenly will take a completely different direction and make you feel the effort was for nothing (/spoiler).It might not reach the level of the original Abe games but Stranger is really up there just for gameplay. Is a good example of a game which goes for playability over plot, specially coming from Oddworld which is known from providing both and instead focuses on a single one.			",158,57,2,14,5,3,13

												Although my favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus, this is a close second. Unlike the previous games which are puzzle/cinematic platformers, this is a cocktail of an FPS, third-person brawler, platformer, and open world game (The open world is nothing large, but its competent). Above all that though, the main selling point of this game is the ammo. In this game you're not pumping lead into some random♥♥♥♥♥mercenarys, you're planning each move and thinking of fun ways to kill the many outlaws in the game. This is because you have bugs and small creatures for ammo, which can do a ton of things, like distracting enemies with the very annoying chippunk, or wrapping outlaws in webs to keep them on the ground for a easy capture with the bolamite. The game also has a fantastic sense of humor, as per usual with the oddworld series, and a lot of boss fights (Although a few are questionably designed). As for story, Its not as complex as the stories in the main quintology, but its still good, and it provides a good amount of lore for people who are interested in it. (Like me)			",101,6,1,7,3,0,1

To this day I still hear echoes of my dumb friends commenting on the pending release of Stranger's Wrath with choruses of ""where's Abe?"" Stranger's Wrath is everything that a game like this needed to be, and everything about it works because Abe is not the central character. It's quirky, hilarious and a refreshingly different take on a FPS style game. One of my all-time favourite games, and if you don't like it we can't be friends.			",68,18,2,6,9,0,14

												Missed this game on it's original console release and was glad to be able to pick up this HD remaster. It's a first person/third person shooter/adventure with an oddworld flavour. You play a bounty hunter known only as the stranger who uses a crossbow which uses small creatures as ammunition. This is the best part of the game as shooting small creatures at your enemies is hilarious and funs. You have a wide range of ammo types like spiders who can wrap up your enemy or squirrels who shout insults that can lure enemies. The game world is also brilliant and typical of the Oddworld world with weird and amusing characters. As ididnt play the original i cant really comment on how well the graphics have been improved but taking them on there own merit they are quite good. The game itself is a lot of fun and has a decent story to it. There are some negatives however. Firstly and most importantly this game seems to have issues running on some computers. I bought the game three years ago and it wouldn't run on my old Windows 7 laptop. I wasn't able to play the game until got a new laptop. So it's worth ensuring it will run on your system before buying. Secondly while getting bounties is fun it does get repetitive after a while despite trying to vary each boss. This isn't a big issue though as the second half is less focused on catching bounties. Overall this is a great original game thats worth getting. 8/10			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

The controls and rhythm of the game flow like water and the excellent writing, characters, and artistry pretty much seal the deal for my undying love.

												For a game of its age, it's looking pretty sharp with the HD update, leaping forward and distinguishing itself from the generation that saw it born.Stranger's Wrath although being part of the large population of FPS, it has enough entretaining elements to distinguish itself from the rest. The hability to whimsily switch between 3rd and 1rst person, be it to turn tail and dodge some bullets or close in and knock some teeth or simply exlpore your surroundings, 3rd person forces a change in strategy as well as gameplay. As for 1rst person, it is pretty standard with only a few variations and some elements thrown in, such as in a pseudo-stealth combat (e.i. neutralize-don't-kill, hiding) however stealth as itself is overpowered but really REALLY situational (scripted settled foliage) and could be better, maybe system limitations couldn't handle line-of-sight detecting at the time. However most of the combat is done in 1rst person, even though you can get creative and trace and strategy mixing 1st/3rd person, 1rst person is more reliable.As for the lore, even though it moves away from the style and tradition of the rest of the oddworld franchise, it still is rich and organic. A deep world to explore and an even deeper foreground as it forms part of the Oddworld universe, most of it deals with the themes of industrialization, explotation of natural resources and native kinship among others.My only complains are that it has not much replay value unless you really love the world they present (as much as I did, it made me lose the count of my plays), and the inclompete universe as the story has stalled and no new game releases have added something new to said universe since the release of the original XBOX version. Nevertheless on a scale this game has a well deserved 4/5			",92,11,0,11,4,0,5

												While not perfect, this game seems to merit all its praise it has received over the past decade.Pros+ Combat, when all comes together, is very dynamic. Different small animals function as your ammunition with their own abilities. Third person melee and first person shooting blend a lot better than expected.+ Platforming and movement can be enjoyable.+ Simple, but rich story.+ Excellent varying environments and soundtrack.+ The game changes its style drastically about 2/3 the way through. To explain how would be a spoiler, but the ""stealth"" and non-lethal takedowns are let go in favor of a smashmouth approach.+ Sense of humor typical to the Oddworld games.+ Well balanced and rewarded careful strategy.Cons- Ear-bleeding-inducing voices. Almost all voices have been digitally altered to be a higher or lower register of a normal human... and altered quite poorly at that. - Early game's focus on ""stealth"" is extrodinarily basic and hard to maintain. Almost all confrontations turn loud.- To get a good reward, enemies need to be ""bagged"", requiring you to hold down control for about 3 seconds on EVERY enemy you knock out or kill. Can get repetitive and annoying.- The late game ammo types, mechanics, and lethal approach were more enjoyable to me than the early game ""tag and bag"" playstyle. Depends what you're into, but this seemed to be the best avenue for combining your attacks.- While there are plenty of ammo types, too many of them serve fairly similar functionalities.- Many boss fights. Some uninspired and annoying.While sometimes repetitive and a bit too slow paced, I enjoyed this retro first/third-person platformer/shooter/beat-'em-up thing. Try to avoid the ""greatest game of all time"" nostalgia filter reviews and enjoy the good this game has to offer that definitely overshadows its faults.			",95,13,0,4,9,2,4

												Although my favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus, this is a close second. Unlike the previous games which are puzzle/cinematic platformers, this is a cocktail of an FPS, third-person brawler, platformer, and open world game (The open world is nothing large, but its competent). Above all that though, the main selling point of this game is the ammo. In this game you're not pumping lead into some random♥♥♥♥♥mercenarys, you're planning each move and thinking of fun ways to kill the many outlaws in the game. This is because you have bugs and small creatures for ammo, which can do a ton of things, like distracting enemies with the very annoying chippunk, or wrapping outlaws in webs to keep them on the ground for a easy capture with the bolamite. The game also has a fantastic sense of humor, as per usual with the oddworld series, and a lot of boss fights (Although a few are questionably designed). As for story, Its not as complex as the stories in the main quintology, but its still good, and it provides a good amount of lore for people who are interested in it. (Like me)			",101,6,1,7,3,0,1

												Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath was a surprise for me: I though I wouldn't like it because of the FPS structure, but I was wrong. After playing a while, the gameplay is better than what I thought. Third-person platforming and FPS action... not with guns but with a crossbow with living ammo caught from the wild. You go look for outlaws and capturing them with these in a western-alike style: excellent.  And be sure you think well how to clear an area, or else you are busted. There's also a plot twist in the middle of the game that is very interesting and incentivates you to play until the end. One of the cons I have is that the gameplay can turn out to be repetitive for some people, but still enjoyable. If you are a fan of Oddworld or someone that wants to experience a different platforming game similar to Portal (except for the portal concept and constant first-person view) I definitely recommend it.

												I love Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD. I had it on my ps3, but I could not get past a boss because I was only a stupid 13 year old who played Halo most of the time, so I saw that the Oddworld series was on sale for a cheap price, and I picked it up, I have not played any of the other games so far, but Strangers wrath is amazing. I love the switch between first person and third person view for different types of game play, and it was done very well. Platforming is quite simple, and if you have played any other platformer game, this won't bee too much of a challenge. The only problem I have with this game is that the default Xbox controls SUCK! I have tried to change them up, but the meny to do so is very confusing, and most of the controlls stayed the same as before. playing with a keyboard however feels very strange for platforming, but first person is good. I would definently reccomend this game to anyone who loves stealth games, platformers, shooters, and overall wierd games (in a good way). I will try to figure out the config menu, and I will edit the review when I get further into the game.			",166,17,0,13,15,1,2

												One of the best games for the original XBox, yet it was never advertised as it was intended, and that kinda killed the game's chances on the public market. Quite a shame what shady business can do for an amazing game such as this.There were some issues getting it to work, and it's not friendly with XSplit Gamecaster, but it remains a VERY solid game for solo play. A gripping storyline and absolutely unique mechanics that I found myself coming back to after almost a decade, wondering if Steam had this gem. And thanks to JAW, it is here on Steam, and it's one of my favorites to play through. Not much replay value, but DEFINITELY worth the once through, or if you're feeling an itch to relive the glorious gameplay and laugh at the cheesy boss names (Jo Momma and Eugene Ius come to mind). A strong 8/10, and I would recommend it, even to people who don't like shooters.P.S. Oddbox is only like ten dollars and you get this with three other games that are all pretty damn good. Pick it up, it's DEFINITELY worth the price!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Was looking forward to playing this game, can't even get past the first area without it crashing for what seems to be no reason. I have tried messing with the compatibility and settings for the game itself. The game runs smoothly for the time I do get to play it in that area. But as soon as I run to move to the next area it crashes each and every time. Very disappointing, loved this game as a child and was happy to see it in steam. Saddens me to give it a bad review.

												<Resolution change might do the trick for you!>What made me a SAD PANDA (Cons):1) Well I tried to play this on my ASUS Gaming RIG thats very much a beast but i got almost near to ZERO FPS unless i toned down the resolution to 1280x and disable Anti Aliasing. 2) The game then started good but may be it's my bad too that i don't prefer to play FPS/Third person shooter solely relying on WSAD movement keys. I generally prefer mouse cursor direction aided with WSAD for shooter games. Its like as if you are using a console controller to play this game. If you are like me you won't have easy time as this game also seems to need lot of planning and shooting in quick time.3) Also the camera in this game also din't help as it slowly auto adjust backs unless you hold on the mouse in that viewPros:1) The game looks amazing. It's hard to beleive this one is xbox classic era while it clearly better than many xbox 360 graphics out there. May be thats the reason this game won few awards for art and technology related stuff2) This isn't a regular button mash untill the enemy dies kind of game. There are lot of weapons and strategy involved in taking down those npc ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.3) If you can deal with WSAD only movements like a MAN then this game may not be that hard to tame.Recommend? YES!! WHY?? Chances are you might be able to run this game ok on lower resolution/graphic settings and in case you don't you can always get your cash refund as this game really deserves to give a shot at it IMHO.

												To be honest I did not expect to like this game as much as I do now.The remastered HD version is stunning, really lovely touchups and graphics added.I'm not usually a big fan of shooting games (I prefer meelee combat) but I LOVED Stranger's Wrath.The variety in ammo and techniques you can use are of a wide range and it keeps the game entertaining and rich.At first I was skepitical about the desert area only, then as I played newer regions were available. I'd have loved to have seen more industrialists/regions but Oddworld has always focused more or less on the native's viewpoint.Overall loved this game so much, it's beautiful, it's fun and there's so much to do and change it's really just wonderful.I would definately recommend this as a buy. Oddworld Inhabitants has not let me down on any of their game so far, outstanding work and I'm glad I found them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is apparent that the developers put a lot of time and effort into making this game great. Just the idea behind this game is great and with them nailing the execution, it just makes it that much better. This is a great game that deserves more recognition.

												In my opinion one of the most underrated games of all time. It's not perfect, but I think it's very entertaining. It's one of those few games that perfectly blends first-person and third-person, and has eccentric, interesting characters suitable for a good movie. There's also a twist halfway through that completely changes the game. It's very bold, and it might make some gamers angry, but I've never seen it in a video game before and it really spices up the story. Even the dialogue is consistently humorous and provides an awesome western feel.			",127,18,1,15,7,2,8

												Missed this game on it's original console release and was glad to be able to pick up this HD remaster. It's a first person/third person shooter/adventure with an oddworld flavour. You play a bounty hunter known only as the stranger who uses a crossbow which uses small creatures as ammunition. This is the best part of the game as shooting small creatures at your enemies is hilarious and funs. You have a wide range of ammo types like spiders who can wrap up your enemy or squirrels who shout insults that can lure enemies. The game world is also brilliant and typical of the Oddworld world with weird and amusing characters. As ididnt play the original i cant really comment on how well the graphics have been improved but taking them on there own merit they are quite good. The game itself is a lot of fun and has a decent story to it. There are some negatives however. Firstly and most importantly this game seems to have issues running on some computers. I bought the game three years ago and it wouldn't run on my old Windows 7 laptop. I wasn't able to play the game until got a new laptop. So it's worth ensuring it will run on your system before buying. Secondly while getting bounties is fun it does get repetitive after a while despite trying to vary each boss. This isn't a big issue though as the second half is less focused on catching bounties. Overall this is a great original game thats worth getting. 8/10			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

												Yet another underrated and not enough appreciated game of the Oddworld series. Distract enemies with rude chipmunks, tie them with spiderweb, sting 'em with bees, stun then with skunks, and much more. No, I'm not spoilering the story, nope.			",117,11,0,7,8,0,6

												When I originally played it on the xBox it was a great game that I remember very well. When I bought this it was for nostalgia but with the HD remake it felt almost like a new game but still had the same feel to it.In Stranger's Wrath you play a Bounty Hunter who is a stranger to all (Even the player). You use a variety of different insects to capture and hand in the bounty's. You have a choice to either jail them alive or hand in their dead corpses. Dead or Alive their coming with you...The game has an extreme sense of uniqueness using the First-Person shooting mechanic and third person parkour mechanic together in a surprisingly fitting fashion.Overall I'd reccommend this game for anyone who's a fan of the Oddworld series or just looking for something interesting.

												A very competent debut shooter from the wonderful Oddworld Inhabitants.  Stranger's Wrath mixes the platforming, puzzlesolving and comprehensive world that made Oddworld a brand name with an interesting shooter element.  Save a few of the everpresent problems that come with ports to PC, this is a well rounded and satisfying game, particularly for fans of Oddworld.			",385,128,3,68,30,5,70

												Alright boys and girls, It's time to take a trip to the feels (Of nostalga) trainBeing that this is one of my most loved games as a kid, on the original xbox i had to see the diffrence of the strangers wrath HDAnd to be honest it dosen't look half bad! Now i may of forgotten alot of the stuff i learned when i played the game years ago but hey i don't care, strangers wrath is one of those games that after you'll beat it you put it down, and go out and do other things for a while like read a book or take a walk ( if you're a casual) that or just play a bunch of other games that kick♥♥♥♥♥ and then after that, you can go right back into the odd world universe and love it. Well at least i can anywayAnd for those who haven't heard or even played any of the odd world games, let me tell you about this one. Imagine a game like red dead redemption, mixed with loony toons adult humor version, with a slight touch of animal cruilty (Cry sum moar PETA) as well as a few touchy feely things that are going wrong with the main character (I won't spoil anything even though you learn about whats wrong with stranger in like 3 countracts into the game) and bam you got this, of course with a few other bits and bobs added to it to give it its own special feelBut in the end, i have to say this game i remember most in all my years of gaming simply due to how unique it is, and trust me, it is! have you played another game where you shoot bugs rodents and other forms of wild life at westernized foes and bag em or tag em while protecting a town of chicken people? No? Then shut up, sit down, and enjoy the ride becuase if there is any copy cat  company that trys to make the same thing, their♥♥♥♥♥is getting blown out of the water by this game. But seriously why are you still reading this? buy the damn game.Also pro tip: Hard mode is really hard, would not suggest for casual gamers			",46,5,0,4,5,2,0

												A departure from the original Oddworld titles, but comes into its own as a fantastically unique adventure game, mixing FPS and third person gameplay surprisingly well to balance out fast, in-your-face gunplay with slick, comfortable platforming and general world traversal relatively seamlessly.I can safely say I haven't played many games that wear as many hats as well as Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. The gameplay rocks, visuals are strange yet immersive, soundtrack is distinct and has some pretty great pieces, and the story is humorous while still managing to touch on some significant aspects of larger industrial expansion and what it does to the environment. I know that sounds preachy, but it's been a staple of the Oddworld franchise since the beginning, and every game does so just subtly enough to deliver a meaningful message through your struggle as the protagonist.Anyways, long story short, if you ever wanted a really weird Western, this is the best one you'll ever see. Now go trap some live ammo and hunt some goons!P.S. Lorne Lanning show us some more Oddworld bby pls.			",395,90,2,30,19,6,30

												Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is not only a great piece of nostalgia from my childhood (playing it on the original Xbox), it is also an amazing game, especially when you think about how old it is!Differences between platforms: There really are no differences other than graphical ones; Original Xbox 480p Xbox 360/PS3 720p (HD) and PC 1080p (HD), so, if you want the game where it shines the most, get it for the pc.Quick Verdict of the story:Main Character: ''Stranger''Ultimate Mission: Raise enough money by collecting bounties issued by different cities/villages to pay for a slightly confusing operation you won't know too much about untill a major plot twist around half way through the game.Positives:- Hilarious Characters- Great atmosphere and environment- Quite long, takes about 10-15 hours to complete (depending on the difficulty of course)- Loads of different types of enemies- Great graphical quality (PC only, even though it looks fine otherwise aswell, you really do notice a major difference on the PC)PC GLITCH FIXES:Black Screen Of Doom  Turn Off Anti-AliasingCan't Move  Turn Off Anti-Aliasing (may need to turn off v-sync aswell) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down, Stranger's Wrath is one of the finest games that Oddworld has ever created. The fact that it is so massively underrated is nothing short of a tragedy. To this day I still hear echoes of my dumb friends commenting on the pending release of Stranger's Wrath with choruses of ""where's Abe?"" Stranger's Wrath is everything that a game like this needed to be, and everything about it works because Abe is not the central character. It's quirky, hilarious and a refreshingly different take on a FPS style game. One of my all-time favourite games, and if you don't like it we can't be friends.			",68,18,2,6,9,0,14

												So if you told my nine year old self that there was going to be an Oddworld game that combined third person exploration with first person shooting, that kid would be jumping for joy. Which is pretty much my reaction when I played this same Oddworld FPS in the present! The controls and rhythm of the game flow like water and the excellent writing, characters, and artistry pretty much seal the deal for my undying love. The HD edition has got a few niggles (like awarding me the Easy achievement when I beat it on Hard), but those are mere wrinkles on a new face for an awesome game.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

Imagine a game like red dead redemption, mixed with loony toons adult humor version, with a slight touch of animal cruilty (Cry sum moar PETA) as well as a few touchy feely things that are going wrong with the main character (I won't spoil anything even though you learn about whats wrong with stranger in like 3 countracts into the game) and bam you got this, of course with a few other bits and bobs added to it to give it its own special feelBut in the end, i have to say this game i remember most in all my years of gaming simply due to how unique it is, and trust me, it is! have you played another game where you shoot bugs rodents and other forms of wild life at westernized foes and bag em or tag em while protecting a town of chicken people? No? Then shut up, sit down, and enjoy the ride becuase if there is any copy cat  company that trys to make the same thing, their♥♥♥♥♥is getting blown out of the water by this game. But seriously why are you still reading this? buy the damn game.Also pro tip: Hard mode is really hard, would not suggest for casual gamers			",46,5,0,4,5,2,0

I'm running this game with a solid 60 FPS, and loving how smooth everything plays on the game.  Content is the same as the original, but prettier.  If your looking to relive the past with this classic please do.  It's as fun as the original release.  Highly Recommended if you have never played it before.Guarunteed to get you a couple of laughs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very competent debut shooter from the wonderful Oddworld Inhabitants.  Stranger's Wrath mixes the platforming, puzzlesolving and comprehensive world that made Oddworld a brand name with an interesting shooter element.  Save a few of the everpresent problems that come with ports to PC, this is a well rounded and satisfying game, particularly for fans of Oddworld.			",385,128,3,68,30,5,70

												This is a classic western, intermingled with science fiction and given a hearty dose of unique gameplay to round it all out.  The switching between first- and third-person views gives the player an intriguing array of abilities as they travel the western end of Mudos in search of moolah and ultimately safety.  The use of small animals as projectile weaponry is quite an entertaining twist on the standard ammo use one normally sees in first-person shooters.  Besides that, you can just shake off damage that's done to you - a better alternative to regenerating health, in my opinion.  Some Oddworld fans claim Stranger's Wrath is not a true Oddworld game, yet they forget that the very theme of Oddworld is there: corporate exploitation of a natural resource and the negative impacts that has on the environment.  Combine this with a hero-figure and you have a true Oddworld game.			",103,21,0,8,16,0,13

												Hub-World Platformer, with elements of Stealth and First Person Shooting.  It starts out slow and stealthy, teaching you about your ""live"" ammo, and letting you get a feel for it; then builds up to a nice mix of stealth with fast and frantic action.  Has an engaging story as all the Oddworld games do.

												When I originally booted this up in 2010, I played with a mouse and keyboard, and it controlled horribly. I couldn't stand the FPS controls as they were unchanged from the Xbox version during the port. That is to say that the mouselook was tied to a constant turn rate and was not optimized for PC playing.That being said, it recently occurred to me to try with my 360 controller, and it's perfect. This is the game I loved back when I played it originally on the Xbox. I should say I own three copies of this game. 1 here on Steam, 1 for the original Xbox, and 1 on PSN.You should play this game. It's perfect. I love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I play Abes Oddesey to death (on both the PS and PC) wrote walkthroughs and guided people through the harder parts of the game. When they ported over to XBox I was shattered and stop playing the games. So when I got this game with a bundle it sat at the bottom of my library collecting digital dust, till today. Now I'm kicking myself for not getting this sooner.There is a lot to say about the game now in HD. One the anmation and detail level is fantastic smooth. Sounds are great as well as the smak talk from some of your ammo. Add in the Oddworld sense of humor and boom you just can't turn your nose up at this game. The michanic of using the different types of ammo to disable or trap you bounties is fantastic and so much fun. I played for the first hour and that's was it I had to make a review becase you have to play this. The ability to flow from FPS to third person was great too becase you could come at your enemys in different ways alowing you to snipe, stratigic or just power your way through.For an old game with a new pretty skin this game tick a lot of boxes so I say buy it :)4/5			",198,120,0,45,19,2,31

												A... unique experience. I love it dearly because I played it back when I was a console peasant, and it was an absolute ton of fun- and it still is! At least to me.It's a sort of platformer with core elements of a shooter, but not entirely dominated by them and it changes form a few times through, but not in unwelcome or unwieldly ways. I don't know why I like it. It's wierd, it's different, and maybe it's not your cup of tea, but would you at least give it a try? Look up a few videos, a few reviews, a few screenshots, and nab it while it's on sale?The one thing I know for sure is that I found it fun, and in the end, that's all it needed do.

												Only discovered they released Oddworld today. Happily bought Oddworld, but hoped more this had been redone too. Was so happy to see it had been redone too. This game and Jet Set Radio Future are my two all time favourite original XBox games. Other games can easily be described as fun, but only a few can be called a treat. Without a doubt, this game is a treat and more. Live ammo that is literally live ammo! Humourous, entertaining, excellent graphics, highly addictive. Everything you want from a game. Has truly stood the test of the time. Looking forward to revisiting this exceptional game. Shame I have to buy a joystick to play, my only complaint. Surprised it's not controller compatible. PLEASE my Logitech F710 is begging!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games for the original XBox, yet it was never advertised as it was intended, and that kinda killed the game's chances on the public market. Quite a shame what shady business can do for an amazing game such as this.There were some issues getting it to work, and it's not friendly with XSplit Gamecaster, but it remains a VERY solid game for solo play. A gripping storyline and absolutely unique mechanics that I found myself coming back to after almost a decade, wondering if Steam had this gem. And thanks to JAW, it is here on Steam, and it's one of my favorites to play through. Not much replay value, but DEFINITELY worth the once through, or if you're feeling an itch to relive the glorious gameplay and laugh at the cheesy boss names (Jo Momma and Eugene Ius come to mind). A strong 8/10, and I would recommend it, even to people who don't like shooters.P.S. Oddbox is only like ten dollars and you get this with three other games that are all pretty damn good. Pick it up, it's DEFINITELY worth the price!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy at your own risk! Many reports of crashing and lack of a response from the developers. I've checked my system compatability, all my settings, and done all the troubleshooting recomendations, all to no avail. When I wrote the developers over a year ago, I never heard back from them. Since then, I've bought a new, more powerful, laptop that made it to the first cut-scene and completely froze up my computer, forcing me to hard boot my system. I can't recommend this game to anyone because, while it was a fun game to play on the Xbox, it simpy does not work for myself and many others on the Steam platform. Also, the absolute lack of a response from the developers is insulting. They don't care about the gamer, they just want your money. Once the transaction is complete, they want nothing more to do with you.			",5,1,0,0,0,0,1

												It's nice when devs have the guts to take a game series in a new direction. It's even nicer when they take a series in a new direction and get nearly everything right. Gameplay-wise, Stranger's Wrath feels like it's in a different dimension from the tales of old Stitchlips but it still has the great and unique Oddworld charm. Graphics look great, combat is quite tactical and I was lucky to have experienced only one or two bugs, none of which were game breaking. Was hooked from the start all the way up to the end.

												This is an OLD game. I want to say first year of the original Xbox old? But it's one of my favorites. You're a bounty hunter that ""has"" to have a procedure done in order to ""save your life"". And man is it fun. The bounties are hilarous in just the way they talk, act, just everything. There's alot of potty humor here, but it's a mock wild west. Why not? And your ammo is living, and almost all of the different types allow creativity to place traps, luring enemies away from the group one by one, or stunning them all at once for an easy Alive Bounty capture. Even though the graphics are dated, the world is still fun to look at, and the characters are still full of, well, character. And you should get quite a few hours out of this, like all good ol' games.			",444,113,5,70,45,4,54

												So if you told my nine year old self that there was going to be an Oddworld game that combined third person exploration with first person shooting, that kid would be jumping for joy. Which is pretty much my reaction when I played this same Oddworld FPS in the present! The controls and rhythm of the game flow like water and the excellent writing, characters, and artistry pretty much seal the deal for my undying love. The HD edition has got a few niggles (like awarding me the Easy achievement when I beat it on Hard), but those are mere wrinkles on a new face for an awesome game.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												Another completely original first/third person, 3D platform game made by one of the best and uninfluenced games developers of all time ""Oddworld Inahbitants"", I have waited many, many years for this!			",83,9,0,0,1,1,8

												There's a lot I could say about this game, but I'd be spoiling. All I can really say is that it's a 3rd person explorer/1st person shooter that keeps well with the strange goings on of Oddworld, and definitely worth the price.			",96,20,1,11,8,0,6
