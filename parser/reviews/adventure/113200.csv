												After playing Super meat boy, I started looking out for new games by the same developer. Edmund Mcmillen’s wonderfully strange imagination is an interesting thing to explore through his games, that’s for sure.This game was not a disappointment. At first, I had no idea what to expect, the trailer was very strange but a tad intriguing. When I came across it there was next to no information about the game and the mechanics of it on the store page and back then there was no costumer reviews to go off of. Admittedly I never actually brought it to give it a go off of the information I was given, I ended up with it from a bundle and it’s the only reason I really played it. Although I wish I had taken the leap to try it because it is well worth it.Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated dungeon crawler, one I have heard to be described as “Zelda-like” (I would have no idea about that, never played a Zelda game) you’re a young boy running from his demented mother. Who has been blinded by her hard-core Christianity and believes that the voice of god has spoken to her and told her to murder her son to prove her loyalty. So a very interesting concept, indeed.A short cut scene plays on start-up, which expands on what I just described, you find yourself wandering through randomly generated dungeon floors, fighting monsters, picking up loot and items as you go along that changes how you fight, gives you different abilities and drastically changes Isaac’s image. At the end of each floor, you fight a boss, and move on down to the next floor. It being harder than before, with a bigger space to explore and more enemies to defeat.There’s a large range of items to collect that when found for the first time is added to the “things I found” section in the main menu, so a lovely bit of collecting there to entice those OCD minded like myself, There’s new characters to unlock which vary in stats, challenges to complete and even some DLC that can extend your gameplay.You are given one life and one life only. You can find hearts to heal, but once you are dead, that’s it, you start all over again. So throughout the whole game and especially when nearing the end, it starts to put a little pressure on and gets that heart rate going. I’m not one to be good under pressure so it gets me every time. I FINALLY managed to complete the game a few times over, again, admittedly, only after I gained some “top tips” from my way-to-good-at-games brother. There have been people that have completed the game 10 times over and still not gotten bored. I think that the randomly generated dungeon element to it keeps its replay ability intact. If it were to replay the same levels over and over when you died, the game would be a lot different and no doubt a lot less popular. I have heard from friends that it is quite hard to complete without “doing your research” on the wiki or seeking tips from those nerdy minded like my brother who managed to figure all of it out themselves. I on the other hand find that kind of thing enjoyable, because it beats you every time and you work and research and try to understand the game more to finally get to that ending. I can quite honestly say that the first time I reached the end, my heart has never beaten that loud or that fast in a long time. And that sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a game, is a on a much higher scale when you work to complete this one. The music is great, it fits the setting perfectly and is great to listen to. Rarely have I actually wanted to download a game’s soundtrack, I can give most soundtracks a thumbs up but not often do I actually want to listen to game music outside of gaming.The art, as per usual in Edmunds games, is amazing. And I hear they are also looking to remake the game to have a more “retro” look, with possible multiplayer features. Which should be very interesting. For those interested you can look up “Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”.All in all, it is a great indie game, which is both fun and challenging. Definitely worth trying, I am not usually the dungeon crawler type, but this game is a lot of fun. The only fault that I had with this game, which has bothered me quite a few times now, is that I have lost my save for no reason. The game is listed as having ‘Steam Cloud’ features, but it definitely doesn't work. I haven't uninstalled the game, I haven't touched it. But recently I hopped on and seen all the progress that I had made was gone. And for a game that has no real save points or ongoing plot to keep up with, your stats, unlocked characters and collection of things you have found is pretty much all you have. I was pretty upset to see it had vanished and it’s something I felt I needed to warn people about. TL;DR : Awesome music, fun and engaging game with a slightly 'twisted' side to it. It's a challenge to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addictive and awesome all around.			",422,282,31,20,33,5,36

												As of writing this I am 500+ hours in and I have to say its one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time, It's really easy to just pick up, yet it also has the ability to make you stay playing for hours on end. Due to all the secrets, items, enemies and most importantly the difficulty it has a ton of replay value. When I say difficult I really do mean it but the more you play the more you learn how to overcome many of the challenges that the game has to offer.Another reason I enjoyed it was the randomly generated levels, this also comes with random enemies, items and secrets, so no two runs end up being the same. The game also borrows a lot from Zelda, so if you are a fan of the level design and many of the mechanics of the early Zelda dungeons and items you will probably be a fan of this.Other than the solid game play it is aesthetically pleasing because of Edmund McMillen's really fun and quirky art style.I really recommend you pick up this title and the expansion pack as soon as possible.

												The Binding of Isaac is a small game with very simple mechanics, but it will catch you with its huge amount of contents, great soundtrack and polished graphics.Sprinkled with humor and nods to gaming's past, The Binding of Isaac is a ballsy game that revels in its absurd moments. Shock value aside, you'll want to play this indie gem over and over again. It's imaginative and  utterly absorbing.I'll put it simply: If you can roll with the macabre toilet humor and if religion jokes don't put you off, AND if you enjoy games with non-optional permadeath, randomized content, tons of secrets and considerable replay value… it's hard to go wrong with The Binding of Isaac. Especially at its low price.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												This is pretty much a roguelike dungeon crawler with quite a bit of influences taken from Zelda, and a ton of religious/Satanic overtones and pretty taboo themes, which was probably designed for masochists....And I mean this in the best way possible.Pros+ Fun and rewarding combat+ The game is difficult, but also fair towards the player+ Nice cutesy but brutal art style+ Gameplay is random with its roguelike elements, making it very addictive+ A lot of different items and powerups to mess around with+ Multiple unlockable characters to suit multiple playstyles+ Plot has a ton of social commentary that will hopefully leave you thinking even after you stop playingCons- Can be glitchy at times- Difficulty curve can be very brutal for newcomersQuestionable? If you're a pretty religious person, you may be pretty offended by the game's style, plot, messages and humor, but you may be able to overlook these things.Overall, I would totally recommend this game to other people.

												A stream-lined rouge-like, filled with morbid imagery and religious overtones. Gratifying combat and a punishing yet fair system of bosses and enemies. The few glitches that it holds are more than made up or with a mind bending story, compelling social commentary and a wonderful community. Pros- Consistent, skill based combat       - A multitude of bosses and enemies       - Hundreds of items (Each with their own individual effects)       - Different characters supporting multiple playstyles       - Complex metagame to masterCons- Glitchy        - Learning curve like a brick wall        - Extremely punishing of mistakes and deaths        - Thick subtext (Overkill at time  [Having to literally kill yourself as a boss])A rewarding experience which captures the journey so perfectly, the destination is rendered irrelevent.

												The game is brilliant (and sooo addictive)! One of the best indie games ever. It is interesting, hard, it has exellent dark humor and atmosphere is epic. It is the game you should take with you to a Desert Island. First you will die a lot, but then (if you are curious enough and tenacious) you'll know tricks and secrets, learn every combination and manage to do crazy amazing stuff.  Music is great, very catchy and suitable, the graphics - cute and old-school.PS Mom! I love you mom, I still do :( I will go to the basement, I will meet my inner demons, fight them and win! And you will be proud, right? Or maybe I'll just play with some dead things (that you threw there), get parasites, decide that I am a cat and can fly and kill you, being one happy and absolutely crazy boy!

												What can I say about The Binding of Isaac. This is by far the best indie games of 2011 I have played. Old school NES Fans, you will not be disappointed. This game has a somewhat resemblance to The Legend of Zelda's dungeons. Even newer gamers will appreciate this addicting, simple yet complex Rogue-Shooter. Coming from the makers of Super Meat Boy, this is a sad comedic gore fest full of surprises. Note that You will die a lot at first but as you keep playing, there are a lot of things to unlock and discover. This game's price value is also a must get for your steam game collection. At 4,99€ you can't go wrong no matter what. Dungeons filled with disgusting and gory, yet funny and sad enemies, will leave you wanting more and more. I found myself a lot of times putting other games aside to go play this game. I will end this review short and simple.A little game with some really good working dark humor. It's very difficult but that's what makes it lasts for soo long. Very addictive game with a high replay rate.			",138,18,5,5,18,1,4

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those few games I own in my library that despite its unforgiving difficulty and no saves, always keeps me coming back for more.One of the reasons for this is its gameplay. The gameplay is top down shooter brilliance. While there will be times that the game will pull a♥♥♥♥♥♥move on you, (it can be quite luck based at times) you won't be blaming your death on a bug of any description. Unless you're a sore loser, but that's your fault, not the game's.While the atmosphere may gross some very few sensitive souls amongst you, it has a reason for being that way and just enhances the (probably short) experiences throughout the game. If you've played Super Meat Boy, you'll feel right at home though, Edmund McMillen's the mastermind behind these two greats, and if you like his work, I also strongly recommend picking up the Basement Collection. Yes, I just recommended a game in another game's recommendation. (Recommendception!)The real reason why I love this game so damn much though, is its stellar replay value. Every single time you start a new game, (and you'll probably start many) everything will be randomized. Enemies, boss fights, of which many are very challenging, items and powerups (good luck getting them all eventually) and rooms (some there to just screw you up with a deadly enemy mix, others with some goodies in) are all always different. Even if you beat the game fully once, there will be more things to do every single time.Be warned though, that the DLC raises difficulty quite a bit. If you feel like you need to be eased into the game first slowly, you should play the vanilla first, and then activate the DLC. Besides that, the DLC adds tons of content and new fights and is most definitely recommended.It has amazing gameplay that keeps you coming back after getting roflstomped, great replay value, and a dirt cheap price. This game is a must in my opinion.			",858,258,31,163,96,14,179

												After more than 700 hours I think it's finally time to review this game, since I think I have played a good amount to give my unbiased oppinino on The Binding of Isaac.First and foremost: Yes, I have played Rebirth. I think it was around my 500 hour mark when Rebirth was released and I was hyped like everyone else but my interest for Rebirth died down really fast and I continued playing Classic Isaac (for a more detailed review on why I prefer Classic Isaac over Rebirth, feel free to check my Review for Rebirth.)However, I absolutely love this game. I would even go so far and say that it's the absolute best game I have ever played and I started playing games when I had a SNES, so calling a game that was made in flash my favorite game of all time is a huge accomplishment.The skill cap in this game is something that is insanely good, games where you can feel that you get progressively better are very rare to come across, but the more you play it, the more you learn what which items do how you can get the most out of every single floor and of course dodging, the more you play it, the better you get at it.The cool thing is, that even after 700 hours you might not find any more secrets or anything like that, but the game never feels repetitive, since every run has a different layout of floors, the items you find are different, the bosses you find are different and the drops you find, as well.Also what this game has over Rebirth, in my opinion, is the limited amount of Items.Sure, there are people who say that at some point u just get specific items and just restart a run to the point where you get an item that is useful, so you limit yourself to a certain amount of items. But that's all up to oneself. You can either restart all time until you get your desired item, but you can also start off with a really bad item and get god-tier items along the way. The way how you play a run with a bad item and how you eventually make it work is all up to your skill at the long run.What I was trying to say is, there are less items in Classic Isaac than in Rebirth, so ultimately you have more control and it is more likely that you get an item that you actually like. As I said, some might see that as a negative, since you limit yourself to certain items, but if I play 20+ runs and only get 1 run where I get 1 item that I like, that's no fun to me.All in all The Binding of Isaac is my favorite game of all time, I would even say the benchmark for all Rogue-like games.(Eternal Edition) As far as the eternal edition go (which is an update for Isaac that was released a couple of days ago) I totally enjoy this update. It adds a Hard Mode to the gae, so for people who have played this game for 700+ hours and don't wanna switch over to Rebirth, this is a great addition, because the name ""Hard Mode"" is exactly what it says.There are ""eternal forms"" of regular mobs and bosses who are way tougher to beat. They have more hit points and different attacks. Another thing that they fixed, which they also added for the regular version, is the time you freeze whenever you pick up an item, trinket, pill, tarot- or playing card. The frame in which you freeze and can't move has been reduced which makes it easier for you to dodge enemies.Once the bugs have been ironed out (there is currently a bug where you can't get out of a room when you fight the eternal form of ""Loki"" this update will be even more awesome than it already is.As I said, if you love Rogue-likes, chances are that you already have this game, but if not, you should definitely give this game a try.I already have 700+ hours in this game and I plan to invest more hours in the future. This game never gets old.			",157,28,3,22,16,1,24

""Yay cancer!"" - just Binding of Isaac quotesThe Binding of Isaac is a Flash-based roguelike dungeon crawler reminiscent of early Legend of Zelda games developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. Inspired heavily from the Biblical story, the game follows Isaac (and a variety of unlockable characters) escaping from his Christian fundamentalist Mother, to whom a voice of God commands to sacrifice Isaac.* GameplayAfter escaping from his Mother’s wrath, Isaac finds himself in a basement filled with monsters. Each floor contains a set amount of rooms culminating with a boss fight that must be cleared in order to advance to the next floor. Along the way Isaac can collect pennies (nickels and dimes as variants) to spend in a Shop or an Arcade, bombs to blow up obstacles or enemies and keys to unlock chests and Treasure rooms. The items found in Treasure rooms, after completing a boss fight and other ways are the core to improving Isaac’s tears (bullets) and fighting abilities. For example, an item can make tears homing, poisonous, increase damage and so on. My favourite is the Ipecac item, which makes your tears explosive and always poisonous. If requirements are fulfilled, Isaac can after a boss fight trade his heart containers to the Devil in exchange for powerful items, or alternatively, avoid taking deals with the Devil to acquire a chance for an Offering from an Angel (Wrath of the Lamb DLC required) which can be useful as well.  The game at first seems very difficult, but as it is completed more and more times, new items, characters, alternate bosses and floors can be unlocked, ensuring there will always be a reason to explore. The game also features many references to McMillen’s other games, such as Super Meat Boy and Time ♥♥♥♥, as well as popular games such as Super Mario, Legend of Zelda and others.* Expansions and the communityWhile the base game is fairly extensive, I heavily recommend obtaining Wrath of the Lamb DLC, which adds 98 new items, a new character, new floors and many other content that improve the experience. Owning said DLC is a prerequisite for the Eternal Update, a free addon developed by Florian Himsl that adds Hard mode, which offers a brutal experience for those feeling the base game was too easy. The Binding of Isaac is very popular and well known, as a result from famous Youtube Let’s Players such as Northernlion and Bisnap. Their unique ways of playing the game have inspired many more to try the game themselves.* Closing commentsThe Binding of Isaac is a very charming (although rather macabre as well) game which is a must have for anyone interested in roguelikes. It can be obtained for 99 cents from Humble Bundles or Steam sales, DLC and awesome soundtrack included. A worthwhile play even after the release of Rebirth.			",27,9,1,4,3,2,14

												I love this game! This is one of the best games I've ever played. This game gets even more fun when you download the Community Remix mod to play this. I have most of my hours in the Community Remix mod.This game is epic and nothing but flawless victory, but there are cons which is a minor part:Pros:+Great design+Unique art-style+Epic combinations of items (gets better in Rebirth)+Challenges+Many endings+Epic soundtracks by Danny Baranowski+Gives great challenge+Humorous sound effects, as well as epic onesIs good and bad:+/-Is extremely hard on the beginning, but gets easier overtime once you get used to stuff+/-Some bosses are easy to abuse with some item combosCons:-Is extremely frustrating sometimes-Overall a bit limited once you've played enough (but this is normal for any game)-Wave of bullets is literally impossible to dodge from the gaps of them because of hitbox-FliesLittle breaks sometimes are highly recommended, because it makes it extremely frustrating if you play it alot and keep constantly failing, because failing is a part of games like this.Would recommend to anyone who likes to have a challenge.9.5/10 dying often makes you have a feel of banging your head to the keyboard and scream for help.

You wanna get deeper and deeper into the Dungeon. + The Game even runs on a Potato. Like legit, you can pick it up even on a Toaster.+ you will unlock different characters with specific statistics and abilities. So every run depends on YOU and your Decisions.+/- The deeper you go into the Dungeon, the harder it gets. If you rage pretty fast, don't pick it up!- NONE*RECOMMENDED*			",663,195,24,70,31,10,52

												Got this game on summer sales 2015.Played it recently.All I can say is I'm hooked and it's very challenging but it's fun.At first it'll be hard for everyone but once you fully grasp the controls, you'll be fine.Vs Mom is hard but Vs Isaac is harder. Trust me when you get there, it'll be hard unless you've got very powerful upgrades to your character.Also what's nice about this game is you'll never play the same level twice cause everytime you play it'll be different. What I slightly dislike is why does my tears only shoot 4 direction, I want to it shoot where I'm clicking but I guess that is why its hard and challenging I fully recommend this game to everyone simply because it's fun, addictive and challenging.9.9/10			",127,35,3,18,15,0,8

												Now, I'm not a fan of these kind of games, but....but...The Binding of Isaac is a game that sticks to you, the game you will play for many days, the game that will invoke frustration mixed with delight, the game that will change your perception on the gaming itself. This is a hard game to play, but it's worth every second of your time. Don't be a stranger - buy it, play it, and after you spend couple of hours playing it, start kicking your head against the wall. You will start kicking your head against the wall, thats for sure. As soon as you play it, you'll understand why you'll do it.			",255,99,7,48,21,4,48

												Where do I start? This game is extremely frustrating to get the hang of. Unless you are a god, you probably can't beat it the first time you play. It took me 42 attempts to beat all six floors and Mom for the first time. I guarantee you will lose your temper at this game at some point. And you might have to do a bit of research on the Wiki or experimenting in-game to find out what every single trinket, activated item, passives and tarot card does and which ones are good or bad for every unlockable character. You might have to take your chances with the pills, as each type is randomly paired with an ability during each run.HOWEVER!The Binding of Isaac is not, and I repeat, NOT, a bad game. As much as it is frustrating, it is really addictive. I thoroughly recommend this to fans of dungeon-styled and bullet hell games. Despite Isaac's innocent look (which he kinda is...look at those big crying eyes!), the style of enemies, rooms and pickups can be incredibly morbid and disturbing. The cries of Mulligans and the appearance of Hives are incredibly distressing, adding to the games overall atmosphere. Nonetheless this really adds charm to the game as a whole. Bear in mind this is coming from the creators of Super Meat Boy, so expect some blood along the way. But what's fun is you never know what to expect. All of the dungeon floor layouts are randomly generated everytime you start a game and aside from Mom being the last boss in the Depths, you never know what boss you will get upon entering its room. There are set bosses for every floor type and the game will randomly select one of these for you to battle. There is a sense of mystery about this game, mainly regarding the bosses, items you can find and what each pill does in every run.Now stop reading this and go buy The Binding of Isaac!!

												     Given the upcoming release of Binding of Issac: Rebirth, I have decided to update my review of The Binding of Issac + The Wrath of Lamb. Having doubled my playtime in the past couple of weeks i have come to the conclusion that my initial response to the game was premature.     For those unfamiliar with Issac, the game is a Rougelike Dual Analogue Shooter. this means you controll Issac (or one of his unlocakble alternates) who fights randomly spawned monsters in a procedurely generated dungeon using his own tears as bullets. Issac is heavially inspired by retro titles, especially the original Legend of Zelda, as can be seen in the way each room is a seperate yet in many ways similar mirror of each other with some room s designated as treasure or boss rooms, and the heart based life meter.     The presentation of Issac is that of a Newgrounds flash game on steriods. To be fair that description is fairly apt. the game is built on the flash engine and if it hadn't had the time, creativity, and vision applied to it that is what it would likely have ended up as. That flash comment is not meant in the derrogative though, the game looks and sounds beautiful (Mostly thanks to Danny Baranowsky). Because it sticks to the limitations of the engine rather than attempt more realistic graphics the game looks perfect for what it is.     Gameplay is where Issac truly shines. The controls are simple and tight, keeping the already difficult gameplay from becoming frustrating. The best part of the gameplay though is the items. The randomly generated items ensure that no two runs are the same. These items are most awesome when they work together (Protip-Polyphimus+Technology =Awesome.). The enemies have unique attack and movement patterns that are easy to learn but will always be able to throw you for a loop.     The only problem I have with the game is the same as it was before. The random nature of the item drops and boss spawns can make some playthroughs almost instant throwaways. This is aliviated by the sortness of the game and the rapidity of the respawn but if a few games in a row with a bad start and even I get frustrated. 8/10. Worthy of a checkout before Rebirth comes out.			",543,182,10,103,54,4,95

In short, is the game good?Yes, yes and triple yes.Is it worth my time and money?Yes. Considering how cheap The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of The Lamb is, there really isn't an excuse *not to buy it*. You will most definitely sink a lot of time into the game and you will have fun.Is this game for anyone?Considering the quasi-random nature of the gameplay, some of the runs you will do will be a walk in the park, while others may be pure nightmare. If you do not enjoy dying and losing progress over and over, this game may not be for you. If that isn't the case, go for it.Linear, open-world or something else?Something else. No two runs will ever be the same. The room layout, boss encounters, items you will get and overall difficulty are mainly dictated at random. While the set pieces themselves do not change properties that much (maybe aside meeting stronger, ""champion"" versions of monsters), the way it's all set up makes every run a fresh, new experience.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?You run around rooms in a 2D top-down view. You collect items that change the way your character behaves (make you faster, slower, stronger, shoot more, shoot faster, etc.). Items aren't really a necessity but without them the run may be near-impossible to do (considering the later levels where enemies deal twice as much damage and bosses have a really high level of health).Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?The game has a very dark and cartoony look, in some places even grotesque. Vibrant colours and simplified forms meet with dark and horror-like rooms filled with hideous monsters that look like something out of Lovecraft's or Kafka's work. All of it feels well put together and it shows that a lot of thought was put into the overall design.Audio design and soundtrack?Excellent choices in sound effects as well as in the music soundtrack. Church-like ambiency clashing with hard guitar riffs and sounds of all kinds of hideous monsters go well together, creating an dark atmosphere that is immersive and enjoyable.Plot, story?Quite unique. The top layer of the story is simple, referring to real world topics such as fundamentalism, parenting and escapism. For those brave enough to take up the challenge, the game rewards the player with a deeper meaning to the story and a bit clearer undestanding what is really going on.How does the game run?I have played and ""finished"" (that is, got the last ending, since the game never really ends) the game on my 5 year old PC (Dual Core 2.66GHz, 2GB RAM, nVidia GeForce 9600GT) and it ran without much problems in fullscreen mode and on the ""Auto"" settings. There were instances where I was experiencing severe framerate issues due to the way the game was programmed (Flash has terrible issues when drawing lots of stuff at once, since it's all vector-based). This was happening in more ""crowded"" rooms such as bullet hell-esque boss fights. Changing the settings to ""Low"" eliminated the problem for me completely. So, if you have a similar PC to mine, just set the game to Low or Medium and it should be fine in fullscreen mode. If you have a newer machine, expect way better results.Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?Yes, the D6 dice. Brings a completely new meta-game into your runs and adds a layer of careful planning.Anything you didn't like?Yes. First of all, Flash. The game could run way better if it wasn't using Flash as a rendering engine. Then again, The Binding of Isaac was meant to be a side-project so it's understandable that the creators didn't have the time and/or resources to write a fully functional, brand new, custom engine from the ground up. Although that will probably change since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is set to come out not too far from now. Second, no controller support. While that's not a dealbreaker, it could've been easily patched in. Instead we see a ""recomendation"", in the options menu, to use Joy2Key. That's not a very professional way of doing things. On the other-hand, the game can be played without problems using a keyboard, so it's not a terribly big issue. Finally, lack of item descriptions. I understand that there's an element of learning when picking up items but a short description of what item does what would be nice. Instead, new players (along with myself) had to use the wiki to check if they want to really pick up this or that item.Final score?I give The Binding of Isaac (+The Wrath of The Lamb) a Mom's Knife out of 5.

												Definitely a must-have for any Steam member. I will admit I didn't enjoy the game at first, but over time it grew on me and I soon realized the charm and brilliance of it. Edmund McMillen did great on this revival of the dying genre of Rogue-like games, and added his own element of unique and fascinating artwork, similar to his previous title, Super Meat Boy. Overall, this game is great, because it brings together so many great elements for a game to have into one wholesome title, making it enjoyable for everyone except those who don't take time to see the beauty of a game.

												Few games can truly claim to walk the fine line between fun and frustration as much as The Binding of Isaac, another hellishly difficult title from Edmund McMillen: the man behind Super Meat Boy. It’s a title that delights in pushing players to the point where they want to start taking swings at their computer before attempting another round guiding its titular tyke through a series of nightmarish and randomized dungeons.A brief animated intro sets up the threadbare plot: Isaac is a young boy living a happy life at home with his mom until she starts hearing the voice of God and hiding him from the evils of the world. It isn’t long until Isaac is permanently locked in his room and awaiting execution at the hands of his mother at the almighty’s behest. Escaping into the basement, Isaac begins his bizarre journey.The Binding of Isaac somehow manages to be disturbing as it is endearing with its balance of gruesome monsters and matching setting with its adorable, wide-eyed sprites. Dungeons are splashed in every foul bodily fluid imaginable—blood, guts, tears, urine, and even an uncomfortable amount of feces. Imagine Hellraiser filmed through the lens of a Saturday morning cartoon for kids. The bestiary is equally grotesque. Armies of maggots and flies are frequent foes, and headless children spewing fountains of blood from their necks are a common sight.Bosses take things a distasteful step forward: fetuses, conjoined twins, fat slugs urinating on the floor, and even Isaac’s mother are just a few of the end-level bosses that need to be dealt with. Keep in mind that the protagonist is also a perpetually-naked boy using his tears as projectiles. The Binding of Isaac is a pretty sick game with aesthetics that would appeal to one’s inner horror fan and Splatterhouse enthusiast. It isn’t going to be to everyone’s tastes, but those that enjoyed Super Meat Boy are probably going to find themselves like McMillen’s perverted sense of style.Since the dungeons are randomized, there’s no telling what you’re going to find whether it be a useful power-up or more monsters. This makes memorization of each level impossible and keeps the experience fresh every time. On the downside, this means success depends on good luck and players will often lose because they were dealt a bad hand. Every time Isaac dies, players wind up right back at the start of the game and even the most patient of individuals will become infuriated by such a design choice. After putting in so much effort and acquiring a myriad of useful abilities, it feels way too harsh.The randomness extends to the power-ups themselves, as there are well over a hundred of them and they don’t always have the expected effect. Some even hurt Isaac and if used in a tight spot are going to guarantee death. At the very least, they can be used in conjunction with other power ups and there’s not much of a limit on how many of them can be used at the same time. Still, there’s nothing worse than getting bad power-ups and items with no end in sight. At that point, it’s probably best to just quit and start again.There’s even some replayability to the title with extra characters that can be unlocked and a bit of exploring to see if there’s anything particularly useful in a given dungeon. The Binding of Isaac is a purposefully short title designed to be played many times over, not just due to its unforgiving nature, that will yield a surprise here and there when players think they’re seen everything. Its ability to keep you guessing is its greatest strength and weakness as it violently seesaws between an enjoyable 2D romp and unbridled frustration.The Binding of Isaac is not for those that are easily deterred, and it’s a safe bet that any Super Meat Boy fans are going to sink their teeth into it. For such a small title, there’s a lot of content packed into it and it’s an experience that isn’t always the same from one playthrough to the next. Players will question whether it was their own skill that carried them through to the end or if it was sheer luck, but regardless of the difficulty it’s an approachable game with a unique charm that boils blood just as easily as it encourages laughter at Isaac’s cartoonish spectacle of childhood trauma.A Must Play ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. I have a lot to say about it, and I think I should start with the bad stuff.*Has no support for resolutions bigger than 1280x900.*Controls are a bit annoyning - you can never put your mouse aside completely because you can't navigate through menus without it.*Can't take screenshots. Maybe it's just for me.*No GamePad support. Yes, I tried JoyToKey, and it doesn't work well.Those are all technical issues that I hope will be solved in Rebirth.NOW - the good stuff.Has so much to explore.Gameplay is amazingly fun. DLC adds a lot off good stuff.RANDOM! You never know what's next.I don't have much to say so just, PLAY IT.			",81,11,0,3,3,0,1

												I have no problem whatsoever understanding why people love this game, but unfortunately, I'm not a particular fan of arcade shooters, rogue-like elements OR permadeath, so I was never going to be its greatest champion. The most I've managed so far is killing one boss and thereby progressing to a second level, and I'm just not ""hardcore"" enough to get much past that, I'm afraid.   So sure, I'm a big cry-baby who needs wimpy things like save-points to find a game truly worthwhile. But if you don't have any such failings, and don't mind an aesthetic as fresh and unique as the gameplay is retro and familiar, then you may well be one of the millions of people who swear by the genius of this product. I'm certainly a fan of Mr McMillen's sensibilities, even if I don't share his skillz in gaming.   A word to the wise, though: apparently subsequent, slightly retitled re-releases of this game are more technically finessed, and the consensus seems to be that this ISN'T the version to buy. So you might want to look into that before forking over your hard-earned dosh (mind you, if you just wanted to give it a quick test to see if it's ""you"", this version on sale may well be the ticket).   Normally I would only recommend a game like this to sickos and weirdos like my good self, but its epic sales figures suggest that the gaming world is comprised of nothing but. Who WOULDN'T love a game about a bawling baby who shoots tear-drops at bleeding-eyed monstrosities while dodging around small mountains of poop surrounded by flies? The world truly is a sad and beautiful place...Verdict: 8/10.			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												Strange is a good word to describe the game overall but that's in the best sense of the word. A lot of fun if you like it's mixture of zelda like labyrinth layouts, SHMUP gameplay plus roguelike elements not to mention the interesting if macabre art direction.The myriad of combinations possible with all the different items you can find in each playthrough really make the game incredibly replayable and a blast to go through each playthrough trying to find new and better builds with Isaac and the other alternate characters that have various strengths and weaknesses relative to the eponymous hero.

												The Binding Of Isaac is an flash indie game developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. The game’s storyline and name are both a reference to the Biblical story known also as Binding of Isaac. In the game, the player controls Isaac, a child that seeks safety in the basement after his mother is given a message of God commanding her to sacrifice her own son in order to proof her faith. In the basement Isaac starts going through dungeons located in the basement having to face his nightmares in form of monsters, in order to escape.    The style and game’s gameplay are inspired by Legend of Zelda series and similar to roguelike, where the rooms of all dungeons are randomly generated, being different each time you play, and this is what makes it so special because every gameplay is totally different. On each floor of the basement, the player must kill monsters in order to proceed to the next room. Along the way, it will be possible to collect keys weapons and power-ups which will increase your chance of surviving because each item has a special effect and you can also pick up coins which are used to buy items in shops spread all over each floor, but need a key to be opened.Each floor of the dungeon ends with a boss room, where a boss must be defeated in order to proceed to the next floor. Each time the bosses are different. At loading screens between floors, Isaac remembers scenarios, of his childhood while crying in fetal position, from rejection of his mother, unlucky moments and even bullying from his friends, some can even be Isaac’s own fears, but you’ll never know.The gameplay is easy to master since does not require very buttons and the soundtrack is not diverse, but it does fit very well the atmosphere of the game.One of the most awesome features of this game, in my opinion, and because due to flash limitation, it’s not possible to save, all your unlockables will stay unlocked and such, but you cannot save mid-game, so you will have to start over every time you go back to main menu, every time you lose and every time you close the game. And that is what makes it so hard and enjoyable since you will not get bored because every time all will be different and new!A DLC to the game was also released, “Wrath of the Lambs”, also a religious reference, and it adds all new content including new items, new rooms, new enemies, new bosses and its totally worth it!     This game has me craving for more every time I play it, the creativity of it is amazing and it will make you spend some good long hours playing it. I totally recommend you to get it.   ~ 9/10  P.s: Brace yourselfes, the remake is here!			",1072,378,32,164,126,18,143

												Only Steam would allow a game where you play as a naked cartoon child who must drown their enemies in a torrent of upgradeable tears, working your way through a questionably large basement until you can face and take down your disturbed Christian mother who seeks to purify you with her foot. And for that I love them, and the creators of said game.Just ... one more playthrough, and then I'll get back to work.			",148,30,1,13,5,0,13

												This is not your average browser flash game: this is some kind of ""Dark souls"" for those stupid easy games.( and have+18 content)We embody Isaac, a normal guy who lives with his mother, they live happy with eachother until his mother starts to heard a ""voice from above"" demanding to sacrifice her own soon, Issac (trapped on his room) find a hatch to the basement, where the adventure begins.There 5 stages + final boss fightEvery single incoming stage increases enemies difficulty (as boss as well), and amount of rooms.The choices can decide your fate, altered by: deals with the devil, tarot cards and pills. You need to know what are they function, to use them effectively and in the right moment.The game is 100% replayable because is never the same on every playthrough, all is randomly generated:-rooms (including enemies, environments, and items to pick), -Boss stages.-Locations of special rooms (which leaves items and others to buy).good sountrack on special partsIt can take plenty of hours to complete :-Fill the vast item collection.-Find the""secrets"".-Unlock all the playable characters (all theirs with unique abylities)-Achieve all endings.

Nice art style, well-fitting soundtrack, addictive gameplay, very high replayability and surprisely deep and dark story of life and fears of Isaac makes you play it over and over again. It's challenging, but rewarding. Random-generated levels and tons of power-ups are not going to let the game bore you. Great indie masterpiece, highly recommended!			",379,73,5,26,28,1,26

												The Binding of Isaac follows the bible story of the same name, as you play Isaac, a scared young lad escaping the religious tenacity of his mother. Binding of Isaac is one of my favourite games on Steam. It has huge, huge playability. If you get it, make sure you get the super-cheap DLC too, which essentially doubles the content of the game. It took me 100 hours to fully complete the game (Golden God) and even then I was missing one of the ""hard"" achievements.With the implementation of the DLC, there's tonnes of new content, bosses, items and trinkets to explore and discover. Amazing game for a super, super cheap price. So worth it. The humour is very dark and can be ""gross"", so if you're a little squeemish, you may wish to avoid!-Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												The Binding Of Isaac is a simple but fun indie game.You play as a young boy named Isaac who is forced to face the evil beings of his basement and further on. There are several stages, but to continue each floor, you have to beat a boss. The dungeons and rooms are randomly generated, so that each time you play everything is different. The creator did an amzing job with this point.There are several characters to unlock, by completing challenging objectives to play as them.Lots of items inhabit the dungeons going from a rail from pointless to very helpfull.This game is amazing without the dlc, with so much contect and area to explore each time you play.Few rooms contain slot machines, a devil, and many more.I find this game amazing for its price and would pick it up any day. An absolute well done to the team who made the game.I rate this game 9/10.			",145,9,3,6,13,1,6

												At first glance, this game may seem simple; however, it's anything but.You start off with simple levels and enemies, collecting items that will help (or sometimes harm) you, getting you ready to fight progressively tougher enemies. Each time you go to the next level, you are met with different enemies, and all new opportunities to get items. And just when you think you've beat the game...you haven't. I'll let you figure out what that means. The items, enemies, rooms, and level layouts are completely random, so you will likely never have the same exact experience in this game twice. Unlocking new characters adds to the experience, as each one has its own benefits and setbacks, making the game easier in some ways and harder in others. Because of the overwhelming amount of items and enemies, I'd always recommend playing with the wiki for the game open, just so that you never make a bad decision when it comes to picking up items. Still, some things in this game come with a learning curve and you'll just have to find out what items you like to use and which ones will make you rage.It'll be frustrating at first, but once you unlock more items and beat your own personal records, you'll be addicted. Buying the Wrath of the Lamb DLC makes the game even tougher (so I suggest buying it after you have a good feel for the base game), but adds loads of new content, including enemies, items, levels, and more.Honestly, I'd recommend this game to anyone I knew, even with all of the dark humor and blasphemous jokes. When you look past all of that, it's a great game with excellent replay value.			",60,13,0,13,18,2,4

												The binding of isaac is one of those games that generate a huge WTF sensation when you first start playing it. You start off as Isaac, a kid whose christian mom decides to sacrifice to Jesus because of reasons, so you run off to your basement to avoid the imminent slaughter. However you soon find out that it is not safe there either, and pave your way to salvation by shooting random monsters with your tears as you progress through the basement's labyrinthine array of rooms. Several power-ups and mom's items (and pills) help you in this battle, while you unlock more of them as well as several other characters with different abilities as you progress in the game. Of course,  you have no idea what each item does when you pick it up and I personally found fun in discovering different items along the way. The binding of Isaac's unique dark humor and artwork have made it instantly recognisable and strangely lovable among other titles of its genre. However it is a difficult and unforgiving game that will send you to your death time an time again.+ Twisted -wtf- humor+ Loads of randomly generated items+ Cool soundtrack+ Great artwork- Can be really hard, especially with the wrath of lamb DLC ",218,129,2,37,18,2,33

Chock full of references to his other games such as Super Meat Boy, Gish, hell even his game titled *C*u*n*t* is referenced! Now let's move onto the replay value. At the time of writing this I have nearly 150 hours. Don't be surprised if you see 500 or something when you read this. Don't go into this game blind. Go watch youtube videos, streamers, etc. This game is extremely tough too, so if you want to buy the DLC with it I HIGHLY recommend beating the game a few times before you buy it. This game is just a true masterpiece with a ton of awesome bugs that makes it beautiful. The Binding of Isaac is possibly my favorite game of all time on Steam. That is all :)Edit: Some grammatical corrections, and eternal update was released, play without eternal first if you're a noob. Just scroll down in your library and then uncheck eternal edition and you should be set. That is all.			",166,33,0,23,20,1,5

												NOTE: This review is just to inform people who plan on buying this game now. TL;DR is: Dont buy it. This game is out of date by now, and worse yet its just too big for flash to handle. The game has moved over to Afterbirth, Which is the far smoother running, more expansive and currently supported replacement. If you were looking to get this instead, I recommend you don't because it most likely will run like crap.EDIT: Since it's evidentally not clear in my review, Afterbirth is not a sequal... it's an addon to the remake (rebirth) using something other than flash. Since flash couldn't handle the original. You will still get all the same story elements by playing afterbirth.  Afterbirth of course includes Rebirth which is the base game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Time to write a serious review (pfft serious) now that Valve added this review thing. Kay.So, I've always been the kind to really despise games where you win based off of luck and luck alone. And yet, this game does rely on luck, but not to the point where it's all you'll win based off of. A bit of skill is involved, in dodging shots and movement, knowing when to pick items, and when to ditch them. The game play is always randomized, so you never know what you're going to get unless you're using a seed in Spidermod. Anyhow, I'm gonna split this review into two main parts, and then extra things. Plot, gameplay, and then anything extra I'd like to add.Plot: The plot of this game is simple, yet it makes enough sense to be a plot. To keep it short, some little kid named Isaac's mother hears the voice of god, saying how corrupt with sin Isaac is, and eventually God tells his mother to kill Isaac in sacrifice. Simple, but pretty messed up. And in escape, Isaac jumps into the basement, unknowing of what's below. Overall, it's a plot, it makes sense, and it ties into the game. Yeah. I personally like how simple the plot is. Just my opinion.Gameplay: Now, for the gameplay, you're thrown into a randomly generated dungeon, and it plays top-down, similar to the Legend of Zelda for NES. You're armed with nothing more than your own tears at first, and have to cry your enemies to death. The controls are explained to you in the first room, with no tutorial, and you're off. Following the doors, you might find some room with a crown on it, known as a treasure room. You can gain items to become more powerful. For example, you might get more firerate on your tears, some laser you can fire instead of tears, you might upgrade your damage, or even your HP. Speaking of HP, when you first play, Isaac will start out with three hearts. On hit, your health goes down, obviously. Red hearts replenish health. However, you can earn blue hearts, and these blue hearts can go ABOVE your max health. However, once you lose them, these soul hearts, they're gone. Anyhow, throughout more exploration, you might find a dark, ominous-looking door. This is the boss room, where you fight the boss of the floor, and after it's defeated, you move on to the next floor. However, if you die, it's back to the beginning with you. A very true rogue-like game. I'll leave the rest for you to figure out, granted you purchase this game.Anything extra: The soundtrack. Nothing much more to say than it's amazing. Yeah. Also, this game is NOT for the weak of stomach, for there is a LOT of blood/gore.Final remarks: Overall, The Binding of Isaac is a VERY fun, and enjoyable game. Death happens a ton, and you're going to get used to it. The gameplay's fun, yet challenging, the plot's very...odd, but still good, and the soundtrack is just amazing.9.5/10. ",121,8,1,6,9,3,5

TOTALLY RAGE!!! 	One of the best roguelike games ever!Religious/Satanic overtones and pretty taboo themes is awesome.The Binding of Isaac is a truly disgusting game. Your weapons are a child’s tears and globules of blood and pus, your enemies are flies the size of cats and toddlers, with their faces stuffed full of spiders. Human excrement litters the floor of almost every randomly generated room, sometimes trailing behind you as you flee from the floating, murderous heads of aborted fetuses.  But! It's AWESOME!And this is best game with re-playing ability ever!I'll recommend to anyone!			",227,34,5,37,10,0,22

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game. It is very replayable and addictive, and the random elements make every run a little bit different. Wrath of the Lamb only expands on this, and makes the game even better than it was before. I would give it a positive rating...If not for Flash.Flash ruins this game. The performance is about as stable and reliable as a one-legged mountain goat, and the game is rife with bugs. The only graphical settings are the nondescript ""Low, Medium, High"", and the game is locked to a certain resolution. There is no controller support, and your progress gets wiped if you clear Flash memory. If you want to play Isaac, just wait for Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a remake that not only gets rid of Flash but also expands on the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After little hours that i spend playing this game, i want to review The Binding Of IsaacStory:This is The Binding Of Isaac, where you play as boy who his name is Isaac and  he lives with his religiously Mother.One day his Mother received an order from God to kill Isaac where you gonna see it at the opening of the game. When his mother received the order from God, Isaac was locked out in his room, and Isaac sees her already preparing knife to kill Isaac. His mother kicked the Isaac door room. Isaac dont know what to do and underneath his carpet theres like a cave full of evil things where Isaac gonna escape from his mother, this is where the adventure starts. Gameplay:At first when i play, suddenly i get used to it (yeah because it was easy..). Im so addicted to this gane, even if im always losing, i just want to finish it again and again. After you defeat the boss, you get into the different cave and gonna defeat all the boss again, until you reach the main boss fight. To makes thing easy this game gives you like ability, unique items and power-ups! And make your own Isaac looks weird AF. Well i dont know what to say anymore, its just very good and addicting!Dont hesitate if you're buying this game or not, just buy it people! And its actually cheap for me especially when this game on sale, i got this when there's Hallowen Sale last year. It is worth it...			",173,33,5,21,13,3,6

												Brutally good game, and I think the most difficult games. The game has a wide variety of laberints,opponents, gifts.When Isaac’s mother starts hearing the voice of God demanding a sacrifice be made to prove her faith, Isaac escapes into the basement facing droves of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, his fears, and eventually his mother. The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy Rogue-like elements. Following Isaac on his journey players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaac’s form giving him super human abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets and fight his way to safety. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Use your tears to kill your mother and her heart, an unborn fetus version of yourself, and dead babies because apparently they are not dead enough already. You can't fool some of these dead babies when you kill them with tears, lasers, and 13th century explosives because they were not born yesterday. After you kill your mother, you can fight Satan or better yet kill yourself AND an undead version of yourself inside of a toy chest! You will spend hours searching inside poop to find pennies! Would definitely recommend to anyone that is not a Jew or a Christian fundamentalist, although Jews may find collecting pennies enjoyable.			",72,15,0,25,20,0,42

												The Binding of Isaac is the quintessential roguelike dungeon-crawling shooter. The player will take control of Isaac, a crying naked young boy trying to escape the basement of his home. Isaacs mother, instructed by god to take his life as a test of faith, is the final boss in the game. Each level is a unique randomly generated dungeon, with 6 to 10 rooms and a boss fight. There are six playable characters that can be unlocked, and more than a hundred different items to discover and use during each random adventure. The gameplay is simple, consisting of dodging enemies attacks and firing Isaacs tears and dropping bombs as a means of offense. The game has a dark sort of humor about it, with each stage seeming to become more and more dangerous and depressing for little Isaac. The gameplay is solid, though the story is quite simple. There are no NPC's, no quests, and no real RPG-like qualities. It is a simple and entertaining romp with a high degree of difficulty, that requires a fair ammount of luck. Created by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, The Binding of Isaac is beloved amongst fans of indie games and dungeon crawlers because of its pick-up-and-play nature and simple setup. For casual players, the game will find a place as a quick and easy shoot-em-up that passes time. Hardcore completionists will have plenty to work for, with a collection system that tracks every item the player has found and many varying and difficult achievements and characters to unlock. The game is single player only, and derives much of its value from the procedurally-generated levels and humorous yet difficult gameplay. If you'd like to see some gameplay, check out AGNBs Let's Play series. PROS: Easy to learn, fun to play, lots to discoverCONS: Very difficult, inherently repetitiveGRAPHICS: 3/5 - Originally a flash game, and it shows.SOUND: 5/5 - Perfectly fitting soundtrack and SFX.STORY: 3/5 - Not a lot in the story department, but not much is needed.GAMEPLAY: 5/5 - Highly addicting ""just one more try"" style gameplay.REPLAY VALUE: 5/5 - I find myself returning to it again and again. Great to play while drunk.OVERALL SCORE: 84/100 - A classic indie piece, well worth the $5. Even better if it's on sale.For more reviews by mowse, check out the mowse talks games Steam Community!

												This game is so utterly addictive. I don't know what it is, but the procedural generation of dungeons and items so different from each other that they actually change the gameplay is what makes this game unique.Brought to you by the creators of Super Meat Boy and a personal favorite Aether (check it out if you don't know it), this game is an arcade-like dungeon-exploring with progression based on repetition. Some may hate the fact that you need to kill the first boss about eight times to unlock the second boss, and you need to kill the second main boss some times to unlock the third boss, and so on.Personally I don't mind that sort of thing, specially due to the random factor that affects the items you get. A lot is based on LUCK, since there are items that are far above others in quality and power, but overall the game is very balanced and you can get a kick out of it no matter the hand you are dealt.System of achievements, items and challenges is what marks the progression of this game, besides the number of times you defeated the bosses. Each challenge is unique and sets you with a made up combo of items (or no item at all), and it is a great thing to have for end-game players.Overall, this game is one of my favorites of all time, and I couldn't be more excited for the release of the reboot, Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. DEFINETELLY worth to check it out, and you are garanteed your money's worth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is a game about a young child, whose devout christian mother tries to kill him. He escapes into the basement through a trapdoor, and then must navigate through the dungeon that is the Basement. It is a 2D Top-down dungeon crawler, where you can play one of several characters. You start out in Isaac's Mothers Basement working your way throughout. The game is strange, but funny and interesting. It feels a lot like The original Legend of Zelda, though most dungeon crawlers do, and it also features co-op play so you can play with friends. I recommend this game if you enjoy adventuring through dungeons! The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is also a fun play if you want to try other games in the series.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												This game is basically a masterpiece and a major success in the realm of randomly-generated games.  I found it quite fun to follow the storyline, and am honestly beginning to wonder who Isaac's dad was, and how he plays into the game. :oPros:- smooth, increasingly simple gameplay- AWESOME soundtrack (Cheers to Danny Baronowsky)- A near infinite variety of how the game could play out- Bosses that actually increase in difficulty and pose quite the challenge (unlike some of today's more modern games)- a challenge in terms of preparing and strategizing, depending on the items you have- There are a few references to other games within it.  (SMB, The Legend of Zelda, for instance)Cons:- It can get quite laggy if there are a lot of things happening at once- It's hard to talk to people while you're in-game, as the fullscreen feature doesn't allow the shift-tab combo to access the community, so you'd have to have it windowed most of the time if you want to talk to peopleThat's all. :3  I DEFINITELY recommend this game. :D			",55,8,1,3,4,0,1

												Fantastic new school version of old school games like Zelda 1 mixed with Smash TV. The gameplay is pretty simple. a 3/4ths top down shooter that allows you to shoot in 4 directions. There are also alternate power ups and bombs to use. Really simple controls like Smash TV mixed with Zelda. You are Isaac, stuck in a multi leveled dungeon. Each one of these dungeon levels is in the old Zelda 1 style where each room is 1 screen. The dungeons / basements are randomized, every room and enemy combination is randomly generating. The gameplay is fun and addictive. The only downside is no lives, no continues. There are tons of quirky weapons, enemies, power ups and bosses. Everyone should spend the $5 to play this game.I can understand if its not for everyone, because it is an arcadey retro Zelda 1 meets Smash TV sort of game. The graphics are cute and charming, but portray horrifying things like if you were to ever see a doodle of a fetus or a doodle of someone coughing out flies and poop staining the floor. Like a sad disparagingly sort of awesome. You play as Issac who basically has to get out of randomized Zelda style dungeons. There are dozens of unique enemies with different attack styles. Few enemies seem to have predictable patterns. There are also plenty of boss battles.The controls take some getting used to, but they are basically Smash TV controls. You use your directional pad, then you use an attack direction. So you can move right and shoot left or up, or down or right. You have a bomb button, a special findable item and an auxiliary power up button for things like pills. The main attack are bullets... which are really tears. Bombs sit, but you can push them, pills do good and bad things. Some items / power ups give you dolls for extra weapons, or a dead cat gives you 9 lives but the catch is you have 1 heart energy per life. You can also get metal hearts, that count as energy, but once they're gone you can't get them back like normal heart healths.You play through 'basement' floor after floor marked with a boss at the end. You find keys, bomb walls, kill enemies, gamble, visit stores, danger rooms and so on. Just like Zelda 1. The only thing is that it is all randomized. The room layouts are randomized, the rooms themselves are randomized, the stores, the weapons, the items.It is all randomized, so you'll never play the same game twice. This isn't a story based game, so it won't appeal to everyone. Its highly entertaining especially in short bursts of play. For that price, you can't miss this game.I highly recommend the game for its gameplay, cheap price and its never the same game twice with the random dungeons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												English:After 108 hours I finally 100% completed The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of the Lamb expansion (all 84 achievements).The amount of hours you can put into it until you don't have nothing else to do is simply incredible given the price you can pay for the pack with the game and expansion (0.99 on a sale).If you never played the game before expect to finish it completely in 150-200+ hours (depending on your skill in this kind of game).For new players the game will probably be kinda difficult and even more with the expansion content so i would recommend playing without it installed (under DLC tab in game properties) at least until you have unlocked It Lives or beaten Sheol once.After that you'll be able to handle most of the new enemies and bosses, and you will appreciate the addition of trinkets and new items.There are several drawbacks with the expansion. Mostly glitches that it introduces such as enemies glitching through some corners, not properly working Brimstone controls, etc. but with all the new game elements you can easily forget about this.PS. Gorgeous soundtrack if you don't know it yet.Español:Despues de 108 horas al fin he completado al 100% The Binding of Isaac + la expansion Wrath of the Lamb (los 84 logros).La cantidad de horas que puedes echarle hasta que no tienes nada mas que hacer es simplemente increible dado el precio por el que puedes comprar el pack con el juego y la expansion (0.99 rebajado).Si nunca has jugado al juego puedes esperar acabarlo completamente en mas de 150-200 horas (dependiendo de tu habilidad en este tipo de juego).A los nuevos jugadores probablemente les resulte dificil y mas aun con el contenido de la expansion, asi que recomendaria jugar sin ella instalada (en la pestaña DLC de las propiedades del juego) al menos hasta que hayas desbloqueado It Lives o superado Sheol una vez. Despues de eso estaras preparado para los nuevos enemigos y jefes, y apreciaras mas los nuevos objetos y los trinkets.La expansion tiene algunos inconvenientes como glitches que introduce del tipo enemigos que traspasan algunas esquinas, los controles del objeto Brimstone no funcionan muy bien, etc. pero con la cantidad de nuevos elementos en el juego uno se puede olvidar perfectamente de esto.PD. Si todavia no lo sabes la banda sonora es impresionante.			",286,61,9,29,15,5,18

												a mix of a rogue game with a shoot em up .quite funny and quite hard with lots of unlockables which will help you in your future runs and despite its inherent simplicity, in my opinion it is one of the best games I have ever seen, good for everyone whatever your gender or ageI didnt like itthe first times but at the end I really liked itbetter dont use any net browsers when playing this, it may produce a lag in your game til you restart the game. Still if you wanna search for something about the game, you can look the guides in the steam program without worrying.			",50,11,0,10,4,0,2

												Binding of Isaac is one of the best games I've played on Steam. It has the right level of difficulty, an interesting base story, and a lot of secrets to uncover. Being able to play as a bunch of different characters, all with different stats and starting items, and random items every time you play through the game, makes the game extremely fun and random. Some runs will work, some won't and a lot does depend on luck, but even in a run where you haven't been particularly lucky you still have a chance to pull it off if you fit in a bit of skill.This is one of the first games I played on Steam, and I didn't really enjoy it at first. I sucked at it, and couldn't even get to the first Mom fight. Eventually though, as I played the game more, I got better and learned how to deal with the various enemies. I learned advantages and disadvantages of picking up certain items, and which items were OP so I could hope for one of those. The wiki really helped a lot at the beginning to help me learn the items, of which there are over 100 each with different effects.Though I believe it's intentional for some characters to be more difficult to play than others, it's not a feature I can fully appreciate. I like when all the characters in a game are balanced, which could have been very possible in BoI but some characters are still distinctly worse than others.This game also takes a long while to get the hang of. At first, I played about 2 hours of this game then quit and didn't play again for almost a year. I was then reintroduced to the game, and I started playing it a lot more. It still took me another long time (maybe 40-50 hours) to beat mom for the first time, and then 100 more hours on top of that to beat ??? at the end of the game. It takes practice and patience to finally beat the game, but it's worth every minute of it.The DLC for this game is definitely required. Wrath of the Lamb adds so much important content and it's not nearly as fun without it. There are significantly fewer items, less end-game content, less enemies, and a lot less fun to be had. Although, with or without the DLC, Binding of Isaac is easily worth the price you pay for it at any time. $8 is nothing compared to the amount of fun you will have playing this game.

												Sure, the game runs like molasses and has limited graphic controls, but its a classic Legend of Zelda inspired dungeon crawler with roguelike elements. There are tons of items, enemies, and bosses to discover along the way and you'll be spending hours finding all of the endings and secrets. It's a game you won't regret buying, and it's only $4.99.p.s. if you wanna get famous on twitch, here's your ticket			",138,30,5,12,13,0,2

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game to pick up then put down.  This game is one of my back-up games when i get bored and dont want to play a really big game. There are so many differnt power-ups that you can use that will always keep your intrest. At times it can get enraging because you loose all your gear due to a small fly. All in all the game is very relaxing/intense.			",107,7,4,7,19,2,5

												A 2D roguelike with a stunning amount of content, engaging gameplay, and interesting art style, The Binding of Isaac is a game that is extremely good. I would argue it is one of the best games of all time. With its high difficulty, enemy variance, different items, and characters, it is infinitely replayable. The different ways you change your play style according to which character you are playing, which items you pick up, or which type of room you walk into always keep gameplay fresh. I strongly recommend buying The Binding of Isaac. It is too good to miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Long version:Ok, so this is a great psychological thriller revolving around fears of a child growing up in a dysfunctional family, being raised by a mother with paranoid schizophrenia, who is experiencing imperative auditory hallucinations which are rigidly and delusionally interpreted and provoke verbal and behavioral responses including obdience. Delusional interpretation manifests in, among others, grandiosity, feeling of a mission, delusions of guilt and sin (the latter being transferred to her child). These result in inappropriate and irresponsible actions which jeopardize the safety of her son, Isaac.Isaac, trying to cope with the family situation, is facing his worst childhood subconscious fears. Subconsciousness is traditionally represented as 'basement' (similarly to e.g. Hitchcock's Psycho). His weapon in fighting those fears is crying and thus, relieving negative emotions. As Isaac goes deeper into the subconscious cleansing himself in a psychoanalytical way, he discovers his most concealed desire - to kill his mom. Short version:It's the only game that your wife will encourage you to play.			",86,121,0,20,12,2,41

												I would heartily recommend The Binding of Isaac to anyone who isn't too squeamish. While the artstyle is very cartoony it still has some disturbing imagery and grotesque designs. That being said, this childlike portayal of such menacing sights offers a very interesting visual presentation for the game.The proof, however, lies in the playing. This begs the question of how well The Binding of Isaac's gameplay holds up. For being such a simple idea initially to shoot baddies while avoiding being shot yourself a surprising amount of complexity is added with its varied item combinations. One game session you may find yourself becoming a flying demon spitting unforgiving lasers from hell, while in the next you may be stuck peeing on enemies as your only form of self defence. The game also does an okay job of ramping up the difficulty as the player progresses.In conclusion, give this game a spin if you can spare the money and you can handle its graphical style. You may also want to consider picking up the expansion Wrath of the Lamb, it makes it even better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hmm, where should I begin.At first I was quite sceptical, to be honest, towards this game. Running around naked in a maze, collecting mushrooms and syringes, killing flies and spiders. Sounds fuun~~*sarcasm*. NAH-AH mothafacka. Those who think it's 'easy' obviously haven't played it.  It's not repetitive in any way, which I value in an indie/rogue-like games and it's incredibly satisfying to beat the game. Especially for the very first time. Just. Trust me. There is just so much in this game, secrets, treasures, that it's a bit over-whelming. It's like: you think you know a lot about the game (leave alone 'know everything about the game'), but I can almost guarantee that you don't.Oh and it's based mostly around religious stuff and God and Satan and a bit more Satan. Did I mention there's a lot of satanic  things? And Devil + Satan <3All in all, it's one of the funniest, weirdest rogue-like games I have ever played, hands down. Definitely worth every hour I have poured into it. Can't wait what 'Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' has to offer with the whole Co-Op function added to it :3Lastly: There are rare golden piles of crap in the game. Just how awesome is that??!

												A simple game with tremendous depth (somehow). You never get tired of finding out what new combination of powerups, trinkets, and items will allow you to... completely fail to escape The Basement.The most rewarding thing I got out of this game is the realization that I really suck at roguelikes and should probably avoid them entirely. I can't thank Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl enough for that. It's just been too long since Temple of Apshai on the C64, and I need to give it a rest.Everyone else will no doubt love Isaac, and I heartily recommended it to them. I'll just stick with easy games like Borderlands and Osmos, and trust that the rest of you can save this little guy, however many times it takes you to 100% the game.			",792,329,21,98,81,10,135

												The Binding of Isaac is an arena style, action-adventure game where it follows the main protagonist, Isaac through the depths of his basement and unknown to escape his insane murderous mother after she receives a sacrifice demand from God. It has an interesting story that is based on events in the Christian religion. This being said, there are many other references such as item names and bosses (Scapular item and Satan boss). You start out with playing Isaac (other characters can be unlocked) battling through six floors until you finally meet and battle your own mother. Additional floors are unlocked with a DLC. The DLC is vital if you want to understand and truly enjoy this game. It unlocks an additional five rooms, all filled with new enemies, new items, and new forms of dark humor, and allows you to generate many more endings, featuring an epic battle against Satan and Isaac himself portraying as a disciple of God.

YouTube™ Video: 60 Second Reviews: Binding of Isaac 

			Views: 2,782		

			Binding of Isaac is an RPG Shooter which will have you crawling around randomly generated dungeons collecting items and killing bosses.		

Binding of Isaac may seem like a really simple top down RPG shooter, but trust me when I say that's just a front. If you can look past the cartoonish art style and simplistic look then you'll see a really expansive game with tonnes to find and do.Now first things first: this game is hard. You will spend a lot of your time dying, dying and dying again. If you're gonna whine about a difficult unforgiving game, then don't get this. When you die, that's game over. You start again at the beginning with nothing.Along your journey you'll find a total over 235 items which upgrade your character. I'd say this is what actually makes the game shine, all the items are randomized so every time you play through it, you'll get different items which change how you play. A really nice touch is that the items also change your character's appearance, which is a visually pleasing change.One issue I have with this is that there's usually no indication as to what the items actually do. Unless you have a wiki open whilst you're playing, you're gonna have a bad time. It would have been nice if they at least included an in-game encyclopaedia.Because all the items are randomized, a lot of this game is down to luck which decides whether or not you actually have a successful game which kinda sucks. Overall, considering it's really cheap and a fun game, it gets a 6 out of 10 so pick it up if you have the money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is a good way to waste time. Each level is randomly generated and death is permanent; you never know what's in store for you when you start it up. Though dying sucks, you'll still likely feel a sense of achievement as you go deeper into the story and unlock more content. I highly recommend having the wiki open while playing, as there are a ton of items with different and obscure effects. I'd also like to suggest playing the base game for a bit before activating the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. It's a fun and compelling game that's just hard enough to make you want to give it another shot, over and over again. Once you've completed some achievements, you can even change youre starting character. The soundtrack is astounding and the enemies are creative. 10/10Because ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is coming out soon, it's probably wise to wait and see if that's any good before buying this. It's supposed to have a lot of new features. The fact that Rebirth exists doesn't make this game any less good but if you can only buy one, you should know you're getting the best.

												One of the absolute most brilliant releases of the 21st century. Binding of isaac tells a horrific story with a multitude of disturbing elements that leave you wondering what the designer was thinking when he made this, but whatever he did, it's done in such a way that it gets to people in the best way possibleBinding of isaac is an exploration based adventure with an extremely well thought out progression system, numerous random elements and all that other goodness. The core gameplay can be summed up as ""easy to learn, hard to master"" and the Wrath of the Lamb DLC once again proves this to be a solid statement.Currently the remake is in progress, but this is what started it, and this is what set the standards for similar games in it's genre. Hardcore roguelike elements and a variety of wacky and impressive in game items provide a fresh experience for a loooong time, with a permadeath mechanic that leaves you on the tip of your chair and wanting more and more each time.To sum up this gem of a game, it's now on sale for an all time low. Less than 2 bucks gets you this beauty of a game and the expansion, but in the end it's priceless.No one will regret picking this up. From the die hards to the softcores, there's a place for everyone in the basement >:)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very dear to me. It's the TLoZ style Rogue-like I didn't know I wanted. I've been playing Isaac for years now, and it never gets less fun. Beware of a challenge and a bit of a learning curve getting started, but is it ever worth it. Very rewarding game, in mechanics and in hubris.			",141,18,1,14,9,0,6

												The Binding of Eye SacA game about a baby whose tear-ducts are so enflamed due to the hardship of his former life, that he sets out into his own basement in order to retrieve a packet of eyedrops that he was given as a christening present.Unfortunately, little does he know, his eyedrops are guarded by the forces of hell (among other things), making it rather difficult for poor Eye Sac to get them back. There's even a giant hairy leg that just so happens to be the true guardian of the eyedrops. It's a bit like that Goron in Ocarina of Time that needs eyedrops because he's been snacking on a few too many delicious Goron ""onions"", but far more dark and depressing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome, awesome, and more awesome and my grilfriend love it too!The Binding of Isaac looks like an old school game like Zelda, but with a very dark scenario and very dark humor.You are Isaac, a naked boy in cellars under his house. His mother want to kill him. You play level after level in a randomly generated dungeon. You are fighting against Monsters and at the end of each level against a random boss.You can collect items which makes you stronger, better or gives you other specials.There are multiple playable characters and endings in the game. The WASD keys are used for movement, with shooting assigned to either the arrow keys or your mouse.I try to play it with X-Box Controller 360, but it does not work. The game does not officially support this setup, it advertises you to download a third-party piece of software. Thats complicated and sucks (The only bad thing in this game). But it does not matter, the game is cool.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing 8 hours I finally finished the game for the first time. It's pretty hard to complete if you can't find good set of items.The Binding of Isaac is a game for people with sick sense of humor and patience. Defeat 7 sins, make deals with the devil, kill your own mother.Personally I don't like roguelike games but this one is totally different. I clearly understand why it's so popular.Game has one flaw: poor optimalization, even on Intel Quad core, GTX760 there are moments when it starts  to work very sloooooow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To save your time I am going to start with a TL;DR in a form of a pros/cons list:Pros:+ Endless replayablity+ Easy to master controls+ Unique design+ Huge item pool+ Nice soundtrack+ There is a DLC available which makes the game even more awesome, adding more items, enemies, game mods etc.Cons:- Quite sluggish sometimes due to the Flash limitations- Might be insanely hard if you get unlucky with the items drop- Could use a built-in manual for the items (I am using this[bindingofisaac.wikia.com] Wikia page as a reference)- VERY addictive.- Sometimes achievements doesn't work out of the box (I am using the 2nd FIX featured here)You navigate your character through a series of randomly generated dungeons, each divided into ""floors"". Each ""floor"" is essencialy a number of ""rooms"", most of which contain various monsters. In order to progress to the next ""floor"", you need to defeat a boss.The character can carry a set of items, some of which are passive, some are activated and some are single-use power-ups.There are also unlockable characters each with unique gameplay style.The story develops as you complete the game numerous times and is pretty much wowen of the Bible references and allusionsThis game is great in terms of value-for-money ratio. Almost endless replayability turns achievements like ""Complete the whole game 9 times"" from a nightmarish grind into a funfest. Well maybe not a funfest, cosidering the fact that sometimes the almighty random makes it really hard to finish your run - you progression is highly item-dependent and all item drops are entirely random.The game features a good soundtrack (which may get a bit old after a few dozens of playthroughs), outstanding and recognizable character design and over a hundred collectible items - some of which interact with each other creating either a deadly combo that will annihilate your enemies or a rather wonky skillset that will hinder your further progression in the current run.Controls and battle system are intuitive - you will get the ropes few moments into the game. The only thing you might find yourself lost at is the huge pool of items - especially considering the fact that not all of them are provided with a full description.So to sum up - this game is a great bang for a buck. I was not sure if I should buy it at first, but I have no regrets now that I bought it. Recommended!			",84,24,2,7,1,0,3

												Not only is the game based on how well you can adapt to certain encounters with what you have, but it's also based on luck. The layout of the area changes each time you play, so while you may get an awful/useless item and immediately be swarmed with enemies in the next room the first time around, you could get extremely lucky and find consecutive unlocked doors with loot inside that will make the next few floors a cakewalk.It's a very good game, and it can get frustrating at times, yes, but it's very enjoyable to play.

												Personal Rating: 8/10I haven't played much of this game and I can't say I will, but it's good. I got it on sale for 49p with all the DLC and what I got was truly amazing. I'm going to go out on a limb here, I don't like platformers, adventure games or dungeon crawlers. This is an adventure, dungeon crawler type game so we're off to a lovely start. I think the reason I like this game the most is the soundtrack, which is absolutely fantastic and I can listen to it on Steam Music. It's also creepy as hell, I mean, I attacked some sort of uterus with a face attached to it, I killed the behemoth thing and was confronted by a flying face.Every playthrough is different, I learnt that the hard way, thinking that it was safe to go into that room when in fact it was full of mutant Isaac's. If you can get this game cheap then you'll enjoy it, not too keen on the story, seems a little meh to be honest, but who needs a story when your game is this ♥♥♥♥ing creepy?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is hard, yet enjoyable. You play as a naked baby trying to get revenge on your mom because she tried to kill you since she's a devoted Christian and heard from a higher power that her son (you) is a sin upon this world. You fight through up to six challenging levels fighting many different types of enemies and bosses. There are a lot of Christian references to this game as well, which I think makes this game quite better, because not many games focus on religious aspects. There are 100+ items to collect on your adventures. Some will make you very powerful while others will be dead weight. Each item has a unique effect so you will want to get every item and see which one suits your tastes the best.For 5 dollars, this game is a steal, it has infinite replayability, it can get very difficult if you don't have the right items, and the atmosphere is pretty amazing			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An incredibly fun, Zelda-like, dungeon crawler with art by the always amazing Edmund McMillen, and programming by Florian Himsl. You play as Isaac, a young boy who is being hunted by his mother, who is on a mission from ""God"" to sacrifice Isaac. You travel through a series of randomly-generated basements and caves, collecting a huge variety of power-ups on your way. The religious themes in Binding are a breath of fresh air, providing some provoking, yet subtle storytelling as you play. The soundtrack as composed by Danny Baranowsky, who had collaborated previously with Edmund McMillen on the critically-acclaimed platformer, Super Meat Boy. Baranowsky created an amazing, metal soundtrack with a few ambient tracks as well. All the music fits the gameplay perfectly. With a huge replay-value and quirky yet creepy environment, there's no way I can't recommend this game, especially at the low price of $4.99.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: July 6, 2014
												The Binding of Isaac is a bit of an oddity for me to review. First let me explain the game. You play a character who shoots enemies in his basement with his tears. The levels consist of several interconnected rooms, through which you generally fight a group of gruesome bad guys (zombies, mutant spiders, etc.). You fight through enough of them to get keys or coins, which allow you to open up rooms with upgrades or to buy upgrades. Each floor has a boss fight, after which you'll drop down to the next floor, then repeat the process. Now let me talk about the difficulty. You will quickly find this game does not mess around. You start off with three hearts. Each hit takes away half a heart; six hits and you're dead. If you die, you go back to the beginning of the game (absolutely no saves). On top of that, you often face multiple enemies who can move faster than you and can shoot projectiles. You also have extremely little recovery time with each hit. You'll need to explore every room to hopefully find powerups or money so you can pay for a little bit of health. Don't expect to find much health throughout each stage, except after bosses. This is easily one of the most difficult games that I've actually still managed to have fun with. Yes, it is frustrating at times, but it never seems unfair. The game plays by a certain set of rules and will always abide by them. There's a certain amount of comfort in knowing that. The enemies on the other hand, they range from mildly annoying to downright evil. But you'll see that for yourself if you buy this game.The game's aesthetic design is great, the music is great, and the story, while macabre, is pretty interesting. The control is very good and the game is consistent in its dark atmosphere that some would call over-the-top dark humor. The art and level design are, for the most part, pretty simple, but that's okay. The game comes off as cartoony, but I think that contributes to the over-the-top gothic feel. Artistically speaking, it kinds of runs in a similar vein as Salad Fingers.While the Binding of Isaac is repetitive, there's actually a lot of variety. The game mixes up the bosses, each room is randomly generated with random enemies and random items, and there are a TON of different powerups. While it should feel like you're going through the motions again and again, for some reason it doesn't. The story isn't anything deep, of course, and any semblance of an actual plot is non-existent. You play through a floor, then drop down to the next; wash, rinse, and repeat. It's very similar to Diablo in that fashion. Some people may like that and that's fine, but just know that that's what this game is. While this seemingly meaningless trek initially irked me, I've gotten used to it and now I see the game for what it is. It's not really trying to be something it's not, and as far as original arcade shooters go, this one is probably the best I've ever played. The no-save feature is necessary, I now feel, because it encourages retrying and retrying. It builds skill. The random nature of the game is definitely a plus because you never play through the game with the exact map and enemy placement twice. The game's large amount of variety ensures the game has high replay value.I've gone back and forth on my opinions with this game. Originally I had mixed feelings because some of the less conventional aspects didn't jibe with my personal preference. However, it is strangely addicting and fun. The difficulty spikes at the fifth floor and gets to (in my opinion) near-impossible levels without mastery. At the moment, the price point ($4.99 for the base game, $2.99 for the DLC) is very good. It's a fun time-waster, especially if you've got a dark sense of humor. Even though I'm not really a fan of arcade shooters, this one sucked me in, and I can't really explain it. As I said before, the art design, music, and controls are all very good, and while the game gets incredibly difficult, it always seems fair. Most importantly, The Binding of Isaac doesn't claim to be something it's not, so it's important to see it for what it is. I've gone back on my mixed feelings and now say that I do recommend this one if you have a dark sense of humor and/or enjoy difficult games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about the Binding of Isaac...It is probably the most frustrated I have ever been at a game, yet I love it all the same. Every run is different, and you could die in the first level, or beat the last boss, dependent partially on your skill and partially on your luck. You never know what you're going to get going into this game. With massive replayability, this is probably the best $5 I have ever spent. The game will slow down every once in a while, as it runs on Flash, but this is usually not too much of a problem.Also, it features absolutely amazing music.If you enjoy rogue-likes, I would seriously recommend giving this game a try.

												What can really be said about The Binding of Isaac at this point that hasn't already been said? A devilish little roguelike wrapped up in a highly-interpretive commentary on relgion and religious iconography with a lot of inspiration from The Legend of Zelda and Robotron/Smash TV style gameplay. The sheer variety of items to find and combine and the massive amount of enemy types and bosses you'll come across make the game's super low price for entry seem almost insane, and even when the game starts asking for multiple playthroughs to finally see the ""true end"" it somehow still keeps tossing new things at you to fight and play with. That said, I don't feel that the game is immediately rewarding and doesn't always make the best of first impressions. The artstyle may not be your thing, the four-way firing mechanics and low rate of fire can make it difficult to really get started, and the heavy reliance on random elements won't always gel with everyone, especially when the game spawns rooms where not taking damage is impossible. It can take a while for The Binding of Isaac to really grab you, and for some it may just never happen. If it does manage to grab you though, you're in for an almost endlessly replayable little treat that just keeps giving and giving. It's also highly recommended that you get as much as you want or can out of the vanilla game before investing in the DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best flash player-based games i've ever seen. You can spend hours and days playing this game and it will not bother you, because every time you press ""new game"" - it will always be a random playthrough. A perfect time-killer. Edmund McMillen is a genius. Only one thing that disturbs you during the game - is lags and freezes  even on good PC's. Highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Highly Addicting Rogue-Like with a cute gruesome storyI would like to point out a few personal criticisms though- All items, rooms, and abilites in the game do not have a description or any information on what they do or used for, there are TONS of different unique items with unique abilities so..you have to pause the game and go look at a Wiki for info (IMO, this is bad game design and is also something I hate about Minecraft)- It's a Rogue-like with VERY RANDOM elements that cause you to fail 9 out of 10 times, and sometimes feels unfair. For instance sometimes you start a run, and you will come across a golden chest, but you can't get to the chest without a bomb, and you can't unlock the chest without a key, and more often than not there won't be any bomb or key pickups on the floor so you are unable to get the chest. (same applies to opening doors, secret rooms, etc.)- As with the previous note abilities are also randomized, so sometimes you can go an entire game without seeing a single dmg + abilitiy making the game feel unfairOther than its a great game that everyone should experience. I know I probably should say more good things about the game, but there's already 99999 positive reviews on the game, so instead I focused on what I didn't like and what I think would make the game better. (criticism = improvements in later games)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like a challenge this is the game for you. I have fully completed this game and I must say it can be pretty rage inducing at some points and luck determines a main part of how the game goes, but to win you do need to try pretty hard yourself too and overal the game is pretty balanced. If you buy the game you should buy the Wrath of the Lamb DLC with it since it is really worth it. It includes more items and bosses. There is a remake of the game called The binding of Isaac: Rebirth (And Afterbirth DLC) and if you like this game I would also recommend Rebirth since it's mostly the same game but with even more horrors and challenges. This game does have one major addition called hard mode/ ethernal mode which adds even harder bosses and harder variations on existing monsters.In conclusion, the game is pretty hard and if you like a chalenge you should consider buying this game especially if its on sale.

												Binding of Isaac creator Edmund McMillen who has worked on other indie games like super meat boy. At first glance you will be questioning getting it but is one of the best indie games I have played. The game is a rouge like with hundreds of items to bump into on the way as you go through room after room, floor after floor killing and defeating bosses along the way. WIth 10 different endings that will increase the difficulty each time you beat one and with different alternate endings after increases the play time value giantly. The game does look very dark on the elements but is a great game with refrences to other games Edmund McMillen as made. I would rate this 10/10 with charcters, mulitple endings, hundred of items you will not find that you have done everything and with each room you go into random everytime you will enjoy your time with this game £4.99 well spent. PS a remade version will be comming out early 2014 with new features and better quality ingame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is a fun, cheap and extremly fun game, with a lot of replayability and almost infinite item combinations that make the game even funnier.The game is incredibly hard when you start playing it but once you get a hang of it you won't want to stop, just like McMillen's Super Meat Boy. In the same way as meat boy, Binding of Isaac also has an flawless sountrack composed by Danny B. with kudos to boss themes.The only ""bad"" aspect of the game i can think is that when you die you have to start all over again, which can get frustrating after a while, but what is a good game without it's difficulty?Overall 10/10			",129,20,2,11,17,2,18

												It was the Winter Sale and everyone was all aboard the hype train. Choo Choooo! I jumped on board.But after hours and hours of playing, I have to say, this is what Extra Credits was talking about when they spoke about the difference between a challenging game and a punishing game. In a challenging game, one is forced to rely on skill, sometimes within a steep learning curve, but there's a high risk reward factor because you know if you do a good job, put in the time and effort to get better, make the smarter calls, you will be rewarded with greater success. There is a system to master, not game or exploit, but master- and when you manage to, you feel like the Master. In a punishing game, like so, you can in one run through be given 2 power ups per room and 2 spiders to defeat per room or NO power ups for 6 straight levels, 8 monsters per room, and every chest gives you multiple bombs that chase you until they explode. Because the effects of the same actions can produce such varying results, the overall feeling over time is that your actions aren't what matters.The end result for me is that instead of feeling challenged, I feel Punished for playing. I might as well have enjoyed rolling a die. To its credit, this has better graphics than just rolling a die and lots of kooky 3spooky5me atmosphere to immerse itself in, good music, and decent controls. But I don't really care if it's a high-spec 120 fps HD sensory feast factory. If the end result is still that it's all a crap shoot, that half the time I should just restart until I get a better first few levels, then there comes a painful awareness the more one plays that the outcome has less to do with me than with all those die rolls.

												Much like the other offerings from Edmund McMillen, The Binding of Isaac is not for the faint of heart or those who are easily discouraged, frustrated, or require a constant, guiding hand to have a good time. The Binding of Isaac will kill you, a lot, over and over, without mercy. However, the genius of its game design beckons to a bygone era where reward and punishment come purely from reflexes, understanding the game mechanics, how enemies move and fight, and a proper utilization of the tools at hand. Because of this design philosophy, Isaac will demand that you play again and again, slowly honing your skill and understanding until you no longer feel small and defenseless. The game can seem impossibly difficult upon first sitting, yet once the wisdom of time accumulates those impossible bosses will suddenly seem like easy prey compared to the horrors you now contend with on the deeper levels.Mechanically, Isaac suffers slightly from its roots as a Flash based game, denying us some of the features and options we have come to expect even from an indie game. However, the gameplay is still brilliant enough to warrant attention and the gameplay is often spot on. Isaac catches and keeps attention with a reliance on perma-death and random pick-ups which can drastically alter how the game is played. One moment you are shooting ineffective tears at enemies, the next you are firing screen extending lasers, the next you are soaring over pits and obstructions with angelic wings. There is enough constant variety available in every play through to keep the game refreshing even on the three-hundredth run, compounded by the introduction of new bosses, deeper levels, new playable characters, and more powerful and interesting bonuses unlocked upon your continued successes.Beyond the addictive gameplay, McMillen has crafted an art style which is often both beautiful and disturbing. The cartoony characterizations mask the devious implications of many of the enemies and items as well as softening the harsh blows presented by the sheer constant brutality of your actions. There is something about Isaac that gets into your head, a fact not discounted by the catchy, haunting music constantly calling you ever further into the abyss. It is not unreasonable to say that Isaac is not a game you can pick up over a weekend, beat, and then forget; on the contrary it will call to you in the waking world, offering one more game, one more chance to redeem all your failed attempts, one more opportunity to immerse yourself in its twisted, witty, and beautiful world.

												I love this game. Also, I hate it. It is just the way it is balanced without even trying to be balanced that makes it really hard and challenging in a dumb, but clever way and any change to any of the mechanics or rates would basicly have the potential to blow up the whole thing. Giving yourself 6 completely random items via spidermod at the very start of the game will nearly always get you a decent set of stuff that is not overpowered and not underpowered- giving yourself 8 or more items will ultimately overpower you in most occasions. I skipped the treasure rooms in these spidermod-runs by the way to make it fair and it was a proof to me that somehow Isaac became a very very complex box of stuff interacting with each other in a very catching way, making you wanna try out new combinations, playstyles, etc. You can play the game super safe for example - or you can just rush it and play sloppy as hell - it doesn't matter. Once you got used to the controls, found out what the items do and basicly go with the flow of the game you can make your own exceptions in playstyle and challenge-stuff. It's a little like maths I guess, but with much more luck involved.			",118,24,0,8,8,0,10

For $5 you get hours and hours of game play, your life in Isaac might only be from 15-50 minutes but the reason you will want to come back is the randomness of it all! No two Isaac runs are the same, you will always have a different item set. This game is a little hard at first but with over 100 hours in I still love this and it is worth the try!

The Binding of Isaac is an addictive twin-stick shooter that rejuvenated the roguelike genre and gifts players with a memorable gaming experience, though it is thoroughly hampered by technical flaws, creative limitations and the existence of a wholly-superior successor.In Isaac, you play as the titular character, a five-year-old boy, fleeing from his homicidal mother throughout the realms that exist beneath his basement. Isaac uses his tears as bullets to fire at enemies. He's aided by items, trinkets, pills and cards that he finds along the way, which further disfigure him until he is almost unrecognizable by the end of the game. The full game can be beat on average in under an hour - this is the staple element of the ""roguelike"" genre, which developer Edmund McMillen implemented in Isaac, effectively resurrecting the genre among the indie game market. Roguelikes are exceptionally short, but are also permadeath, meaning that a character's death is absolute. Finally, each playthrough of the game is randomly generated, with no two playthroughs featuring the same items, bosses and floor layouts. This all effectively means that Isaac is infinitely replayable, for there is always the motivation of finding undiscovered, superpowerful item combinations to keep players coming back.The unique thematic styles that the game contains provides an experience that can be quite subjective and polarizing, though those coming in with open minds find that they enjoy Isaac's charm over time. The game has significant connection to the Christian faith: the title of the game, the names of the characters (minus one) and many items contain references to the contents of the Bible. Though these references are not explicitly sacriligious, considering the context of the game (surrounded by a naked crying child and rooms full of poop) and its lore (with divine intervention driving Isaac's mother to hunt him down), those who are deeply devout may be turned off by the game's subject matter. The music is somber and melancholic, underscoring Isaac's desperation throughout his journey. Overarching visual presentation possesses an air of artistry, due to the models of characters and enemies being hand-drawn by developer Edmund McMillen, then being directly transplanted into the game. The wide variety of sizes and styles for enemies and item effects allows players to internalize what certain things do, which in turn paves the way for strategic deveopment and improved play upon practice.The issues that this game faces are great in number, and cannot be solely attributed to the game's genre. Technologically, the game has faults that could even lead it to being described as ""broken"". The limitations of the Flash medium the game was designed on is often attributed as the cause of framerate issues, as well as cases of the game freezing while loading certain levels, the latter of which has become so well-known in the community that it even has its own name (""the Pink Glitch""). The in-game stat screen on the pause menu is known to misrepresent the actual stats of the player, and either way is too vague to be useful. Some item descriptions outright lie to the player, and at least one item and one trinket are known to either do nothing or solely harm the player. There are some interactions that allow the player to fall to negative health. Though these facets harm most players, there is an interesting metagame that exists in the Isaac community that calls for exploitation of known bugs and synergies to literally ""break the game"", by getting every item available or forcing the game to crash while trying to get there. What is arguably more dissappointing than these technical issues are the ample lack of synergies. Though some basic tear modifiers can stack on in large numbers to create crazy effects, the strongest items in the game that change your attack from tears to another format largely cancel each other out upon pickup, with invisible stat changes the only possible outcome. The game punted its opporunity to become great by neglecting to implement synergies to so many combinations.Despite the aforementioned issues, Isaac was still the standard-bearer for the roguelike genre and was a phenominally popular game. However, it has been dethroned by its own reimagining: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This recent successor was developed by a new development team and has addressed the numerous technical and synergistic issues noted above. Though the game is not perfect, it is far superior to the original Isaac on virtually all levels. Therefore, in consideration of buyers' finances, if you're new to the franchise then get Rebirth. However, on its own, this is still a brilliantly-conceived title with engaging gameplay and an indefinite lifespan. Considering the price for the original is often so low on the Internet, it may still even be worth purchase now. The Binding of Isaac gets a C+.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic to kill time. At first I was disappointed to see how similar this was to Zelda but now that I played it I can say they aren't alike in any way as this game has an awesome randoming each time you want to start your game, which adds surprise to the mix.

												Probably one of the best game I ever played.First of all, every of your playthroughs will be randomly generated, you just can't have the same playthrough.There a tons of things to unlock (characters and items), a tons of monster that'll try to kick your♥♥♥♥♥The gameplay itself is not simple, there are certains rules that you need to understand (what item to pick up and which one will screw your run).You can learn by just playing by yourself but I'd recommend to check the wiki and some youtuber's channel (bisnap for example) to understand the most complicated mechanics of this game. The soundtrack is quite nice but can be repetitive at time.On and one last thing, if you never played this game you shouldn't buy the dlc until you beat mom a few times. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just buy it and the DLC. It's worth full price but even goes on sale for cheap.The Binding of Isaac's story is quite biblical, and as a result, helps you learn lots of Biblical names (if that's your thing) while having a wonderful time. The constant rewards make you feel like you're doing really good, and keep the game interesting for a long time.Medium 100% Time Consuming Yet Enjoyable10/10 Poops			",587,270,20,56,67,4,65

												I love this game. Also, I hate it. It is just the way it is balanced without even trying to be balanced that makes it really hard and challenging in a dumb, but clever way and any change to any of the mechanics or rates would basicly have the potential to blow up the whole thing. Giving yourself 6 completely random items via spidermod at the very start of the game will nearly always get you a decent set of stuff that is not overpowered and not underpowered- giving yourself 8 or more items will ultimately overpower you in most occasions. I skipped the treasure rooms in these spidermod-runs by the way to make it fair and it was a proof to me that somehow Isaac became a very very complex box of stuff interacting with each other in a very catching way, making you wanna try out new combinations, playstyles, etc. You can play the game super safe for example - or you can just rush it and play sloppy as hell - it doesn't matter. Once you got used to the controls, found out what the items do and basicly go with the flow of the game you can make your own exceptions in playstyle and challenge-stuff. It's a little like maths I guess, but with much more luck involved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What really makes 'The Binding of Isaac' a good game though isn't one individual element, its how it all ties together so well to match up thematically bringing together a really compelling experience. The dark overall themes, the random levels with unknown monsters and power up that always keep you on your toes, the music and art design ensuring that you know this is a giant metaphor for a trip through the seven layers of hell. At the end of the day though I know that the 'The Binding of Isaac' isn't for everyone, if you like retro games like Contra then you should get this otherwise stay away because the very reason that makes this game good (a perfect side scrolling shooter true to the genre) is the same reason that people will hate it. Its a matter of taste and you really should be taking some of the blame if you have no idea what you like and don't like by now.If you want to read a longer review you can find it here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-binding-of-isaac.html.

												Really nice Indie game ! I think The Binding of Isaac is  part of the best Indie games with Super Meat Boy and others.At first, I found this game kinda horrific to be honest, but after a bit of time, I appreciated it, and now, I don't care to see a child kill misshapens childs with his tears.I don't care to see a child kill its own mother heart.I don't care to see a child kill Sat... What ?!Yeah... this game helped me discover one of the best OST ever.The gameplay is really simple, but the game itself is really hard when you use to play at the highest difficulties.- 10 differents floor ( with DLC )--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Basement- The Cellar ( with DLC )- The Caves- The Catacombs ( with DLC )- The Depths- Necropolis ( with DLC )- The Womb- Utero ( with DLC )- Cathedral- Sheol------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of differents ennemies, and a...

												This game is a complete surprise.  The graphics are minimalistic, the sounds are average, and the gameplay quite retro zelda like.  But for some reason, because it's a short game that can only take you 30 minutes to beat in one playthrough it's not about the one playthrough.  Each time through you will find different random upgrades or weapons, different monsters, different bosses and of course different loot.  This is by no means an easy game.  Might get frustrating, but for some reason I keep coming back to it.  This game is fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's dirt  cheap during any sale and it is as gold as everything else Team Meat has managed to churn out. If you are curious what you are getting into it, it's something strangely familiar and incredibly well made. It is basically a top down shooter reminescent of old Zelda games (my favorite kind) with roguelike elements and some twisted humor.*On a side note: buy the DLC, I don't need to add why, its everything you love topped with more of what you love.Roguelikes have been making a resurgence lately as part of the revisionist mantra of ""real gamers like hardcore challenges"". Which is all well and good, sure I like to be challenged in certain ways, but I definitely like to relax too. More importantly it's not just any challenge that gamers should clamor for, it's the good kind, the fair kind. Team Meat has this down perfectly. When ever you die in one of their games it's not a question of a flaw in the game's design, an enemy that is overpower, or an impossible obstacle, the only the wrong is you. The game has a simple set of mechanics and some secrets in gameplay that you can and should figure out on your own. When you lose in this game you should feel that welcome brand of shame that says ""I should've known better"". This game isn't trying to fool, you know what you are playing and you know what you should've done.The real draw from a game that is continously killing you, besides the superb gamplay, is the sense of progress and reward. There is a plethora of secrets to be found in The Binding of Isaac, all unlocked in a variety of ways and adding to the gameplay. The game starts with Isaac, there are more characters to unlock later, shooting tears and running around naked. From defeating bosses, random chests, or treasure rooms, Isaac unlocks various items that alter his abilities. Most of the abilities are passive and stack, and some are useable abilities like cards or a cat's head. These items are all random ( a treasure may net you a spiffy spider upgrade to your tears or just a teleporter) and the levels are procedurally generated. On top of all  the game altering the items can do, they also change your character's appearance into something that is usually atrocious and hilarious.The Binding of Isaac will kill you a lot (and not in the Dark Souls way where  you can still get something back and respawn from the last campfire), but you will never feel like it was a waste. I've had some two minute sessions of this game that netted me a new secret item, and there is always something to unlock in The Binding of Isaac. After dying so many times you will get better, and then you will still keep dying, but you'll enjoy it.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is a superb rougelike game featureing over 200 items and 50+ monsters the replayablity is endless.I personally think that if you going to buy this game and you are clueless of what this game is, you should figure it out for yourself rather than watching a Let's play or any sort of walktrough of it.And why you may ask?Because one of the biggest strong points about this game is learning what everything does and what should bosses and enemies you should be thirlled from.Altrough this game is pretty modern game it is more based on retro games and the diffuclty curve is alot bigger then other exsisting game which adds to the fun of this gameOver the top you have the awesome looking artstyle and the amazingly fitting religious soundtrack made by Danny B. which made also the soundtrack for another one of Edmund Mcmillen games Super Meat BoyI find that the weakset point of this game is the fact it runs on flash and it means it very limited by performance and on rooms with alot of enemies and particle effects the game may run poorly even on high-end machines.I think that in this 5$ price point, and it is a must have for any type of gamer.Not convinced yet?Go to Newgrounds and try the demo for yourself!

												This game is truthfully amazing. I spent some time on it, I wish I could spend some more, and I figured it was worth every digital penny. There are a large amount of items, with the levels changing every time you play, making it never the same game every time you play it.Pros- +Very good price for such a fun game+Soundtracks are amazing+Difficult, but not impossible+Large variety of levels+Large variety of items+DLC, Wrath of the Lamb adds such a large amount, it's almost like a different game- And in a good way.+Looks like a classic browser game, and not a hugely computer intensive game+VERY small download, meaning it should take you less than a good minute (With bad internet) to download+Not very computer intenseCons--Music volume I found could not be changed, only disabled or enabled-Satanic references, but if anything has religion references in it there is bound to be something Anti within itAll in all, this game is worth your time and I would suggest it.So long as you are fine with seeing religion stuff within it.

												Really nice Indie game ! I think The Binding of Isaac is  part of the best Indie games with Super Meat Boy and others.At first, I found this game kinda horrific to be honest, but after a bit of time, I appreciated it, and now, I don't care to see a child kill misshapens childs with his tears.I don't care to see a child kill its own mother heart.I don't care to see a child kill Sat... What ?!Yeah... this game helped me discover one of the best OST ever.The gameplay is really simple, but the game itself is really hard when you use to play at the highest difficulties.- 10 differents floor ( with DLC )--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Basement- The Cellar ( with DLC )- The Caves- The Catacombs ( with DLC )- The Depths- Necropolis ( with DLC )- The Womb- Utero ( with DLC )- Cathedral- Sheol------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of differents ennemies, and a... AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF COMBINATIONYou have 6846467486756415647 items, and you'll need luck to get the best of them to become a God...Hmm... yeah.8/10, because the DLC make me lag a lot.

												It is one of the best and toughest games that i have played, the beginning is easy, but the difficulty level to level increases considerably, not forgetting the key points in this game:- Simple gameplay, but challenging.- Simple Atmosphere.- A great touch of humor that developers added to this great title.- Tons of items, enemies and abilities.- The soundtrack and sound effects give a very special touch.I bought this game in steam sales (Ultra cheap) and i do not regret purchasing it.10 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac Game ReviewThe binding of Isaac is a indie rogue-like platformer game about a child called Isaac and his crazy religious mother. It is a game filled with secrets and unlockable characters and items with 2 DLC packs. After playing The Binding of Isaac for a few hours I realised there was a reason so many people described the game as “Unforgiving” and “disturbing”, It’s because its filled with satanic references, blood and gore. Not only that but The Binding of Isaac is incredibly difficult, only after my first 10 tries was I able to kill mom once. My favourite thing about The Binding of Isaac would have to be the game breaking aspect. By game breaking I mean there are some incompatible items in the game which cause you to have infinite health or can help you to get every item in the game. There is actually a massive part of the community that has dedicated itself to finding game breaking glitches that can make them extremely overpowered; some of these people have broken the game to the extent that a single attack on any boss will kill them instantly.Controls and GameplayThe controls to The Binding of Isaac are basic. WASD to move and your arrow keys to direct your attack. You move around the basement from room to room, each room containing something different. There are normal rooms which contain enemies, gold rooms which contain power up items that will impact your speed, damage, health and can sometimes impact you negatively. You first meet Isaac and his mother in the loading screen for the game which describes their lives as being happy until she hears a voice from above. The voice of god tells her to kill Isaac and Isaac, hearing this, flees into the houses basement to get away from his homicidal mother which is when the games main menu loads.  The game is about Isaac making his way through the basement to eventually reach and kill the boss, Mom. As you make your way through the basement you will encounter multiple different types of enemies (foetuses, pinworms, embryos, flaming headless monsters and lots of bugs) which will all try to kill you.Graphics and SoundThe graphics for The Binding of Isaac were made to have a retro feel to them. They have options for the in game detail which affects the rooms you enter. High detail means there will be cobwebs and blood on the walls while low detail will give you none of that. The detail setting also affects the pixels in game so setting it to low will give you a very fuzzy effect while high makes it look HD in comparison. The music in The Binding of Isaac is very varied. The music changes depending on the floor and room you are on/in. The music keeps you focused while playing and can help you to know what type of room or floor you are on.  The sounds in The Binding of Isaac are very eerie to say the least. The squishing noises when you kill monsters and the screaming from bosses I found to be very unsettling when I was playing and actually impacted on my performance when I was playing. Replayability and MultiplayerThe Binding of Isaac is literally the most replayable game I have ever played; this is because of how unforgiving the game and how interesting the storyline is. With over 341 items and 178 secrets in the game you must replay constantly to finish the game with everything unlocked. There has never been a official multiplayer feature for The Binding of Isaac however the great community surrounding it has created a few multiplayer mods for people to use. This let you play 2 players with you and another person on the same keyboard and you can both move around and shoot and fight enemies. Although the multiplayer mod is good, I think it ruins the game as there is no balancing aspect to the mod meaning there is now2 players but the same amount of bosses and enemies.To ConcludeI found The Binding of Isaac to be a ridiculously good indie game. The complexity of the story line and the references to religion surprised me and definitely made me enjoy the game a lot more. At only £4.00 this game is definitely one I would pick up off the steam store, especially as it is now one of my most played games and it’s one of the cheapest I own, this game practically pays for itself in minutes. The games DLC is also worth getting as it doubles the amount of content that is already inside this jam packed game, it adds characters, items, floors, monsters and more difficult bosses.  So to give this game a rating I would have to give it a:•	Easy to learn controls ✓•	Gameplay ✓•	Graphics ✓•	Sound/Music ✓•	Replayable ✓•	Multiplayer  XRATED 5/6			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Umm... I don't know what to say about this game. it's... Weird. But overall (Even though i played a little on this account, and about 250+ hours on my old account), it's a fantastic, evenly priced game. Gives a Lot of Hours of Gameplay (Reaching the Cathedral is HARD, and takes over 13 successful runs that take a crapton of time >.<), with Many (MANY!) Items that appear randomly through the many levels (Random as well, for Pretty much Endless Fun), And will make you Become pretty much a Tank to anything that comes after You. A thing that's also Impressive is that how The game itself has a Kind of Creepy and Morbid Gameplay, but also Really Fun and Bizzarre, and Still Holding up to Comic-Like Graphics. More things like Challenges, Character selection (Each with its own Special Item and Starting Stats), A Handful of different Enemies, Random Bosses Each Level, Collection of Items, A lot of In-Game and Steam Achievements (With Many In-Game Unlockables to be found), An Interesting Backstory of the Main Character And a Fantastic amount of 13+ Endings, Make the Icing on this Strange But Amazing Cake. Also, You can ""Tear"" Down Enemies. *Da Bum Tss*. Overall, For me it's 9.2/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the first game I've ever played where I can end up both hating it and love it at the same time, it's a cartoony dark souls, you'll die... you'll die lots. You may have a good run where you get lots of fantastic items, and then the next it will be constant rubbish, but half the fun is trying to get as far as you can with the things you have (I'm sure there is a life lesson in there)The graphics are nice, the music is ok but it does get very repetitive quickly, the gameplay is fun but frustrating (vague memories of hurling abuse at the screen), however when you have stupid amounts of failure and then finish it, that is a great feeling of pride. whether full price or on sale, it's a bargain			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another beautifully composed game by Team Meat (Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes), a small independent developer who also created top hit Super Meat Boy. The Binding of Isaac strikes a resemblance to the original Legend of Zelda exploration esque gameplay through caves and dungeons, except in this title the main character (and arguable protagonist) Isaac ventures through his basement trying to escape his mother who is asked by the voice of God to make a sacrifice to prove her faith. The game implements great gameplay mechanics (which adapt to your style of progressing through the game to continuously increase the games difficulty), clever visuals, and a great plot to create an amazing atmosphere in a must have PC title.

												I have to say, The Binding of Isaac is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.If you ask me, I have launched this game ATLEAST once or twice a DAY to get my ose of it. It's a little disturbing in some places, sure, but it brings comedy, horror, and PLOT into the game. You play as a boy named Isaac, a boy who has been doing sinful things throughout his life. His mother becomes insane, hearing that her son is the work of the devil, and he must be saved by being punished. With death. It's godly enough to be a nice rogue like, game. I suggest to buy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really recommend this to people who love the ""old kind of hard games"" (like first gen consoles) but you should always play it with a cheap keyboard.... or have a emergency keyboard near that cost less so you can smash that one against the wall :D  all my thumbs up for the binding of isaac :D			",122,72,2,31,20,0,12

												I must highly recommend this game it's simple, fun, and challenging. Trying to get no-damage achievements makes me cry.. okay, perhaps sometimes it's more challenging than fun. I like it though, even then.. Not good for players who want every achievement in a game with low effort - it's not going to happen here. Getting most achievements will take a lot of time - but it feels so rewarding to survive.. and getting an achievement is even more so. The game requires a dlc to finish, still - it's quite affordable, WoTL doubles the game length, increases difficulty - adds more variety.  I feel a DLC is worth the cash, even for those who don't intend to 100% the game. Just be prepared, pick up and win won't happen, in fact it requires quite a few playthroughs to unlock all the items, including a few of the most powerful ones. Though somewhat morbid, this top-down adventure game has definitely earned a spot in my top 5 favorite games on steam.~ Good luck in this game, I hope you give it the time to grow on you, and enjoy it as much as I have. Definitely a 10/10 from me.			",98,9,0,16,2,2,4

												I told myself I wasn't going to write a review until I beat the game. But after playing 3 hours of this brutal top down dungeon crawler I realized I may never write a review. With that being said, lets get right into it. The Binding of Isaac is a top down dungeon crawler game based off of a story in the Bible. The story goes is that there is a a man named Abraham who is visted by God himself and is asked to sacrafice his son Isaac. This story is a lot like The Binding of Isaac (Discount the monsters and dungeons). Right off the bat you can see that The Binding of Isaac is not just some regular top down dungeon crawler game. It has amazing art combined with a dark depressing theme. Each and every enemy you encounter will shock you, you will have to remember these enemies, how they look like, and their attack patterns in order to advance further into the game. The items are goofy and loveable. Now lets do some pros and cons.Pros:- Fantasic soundtrack that will always keep you pumped up for the next boss- Vague yet incapturing story- A large variety of enemies that will only get harder as you avance further into the game- Unlockable characters, somthing to always strive to- There are indeed multiple endings- Until you've seen all endings and unlocked all characters and collected all items, there is always replay valueCons:- This game is impossibly difficultI know there is only one con but that con is no joke. This game is hard and unforgiving. It's fun at times but it really does suck when you die right before the ""Mom Fight"". It has a deep learning curve and there is no description on any item you get, which means in order to use it right you have to look it up on the wikia. If you intend on buying this game there is a few things to know.1) You are buying a game that is difficult, and there's no way of changing that.2)  If you plan on really going hard at this game, there is some reseach and memorizing involed.3) If you are religious in any way, you may find this game's content to be offensive. My final thought on this game is that it's a well made indie cult classic. I enjoy this game enough to play it every once and a while but not crazy about it. As for the DLC and Rebirth, I do not plan on buying those anytime soon. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Binding of Isaac..Yes, the Binding of Isaac is one of the deepest, heart touching and emotionful game about life of a little boy named Isaac. It has many Bible references, those make the game more mysterious and interesting. Not willing to spoil anything, but it's more like how Isaacs life turned into hell. He just lived a happy, joyful and simple life with his Mother in a small house on a hill. But one day Isaacs Mom heard a voice from above.. The God tells his Mother to prove her faith in him by sacrificing Isaac.The gameplay reminded me a lot of Zelda games - Bombs: used to break rocks, kill enemies and cut Your way through closed doors if needed. Coins: Used to play slot machines, buy items and etc. Keys: Unlock treasure rooms and other locked doors. It is also a very random, no two runs are the same, random pick-ups and enemies. Variety of items - over 250 items! every collectible You pick will be shown on Your character. Make Your shots (tears) stronger by collecting those items to defeat more difficult bosses, make Your Character faster by collecting other types of items, to dodge enemy attacks and so on! I'm definitely recommending it! You won't regret! The soundtrack is also very nice and fits the game. Many endings will keep You satisfied to play more, even if You die (Death is permanent in game).But the game has a deeper meaning to it, wayy deeper, it is what it makes so original and very different, from the other games, even games from the same creator. Yes, it is sad and You'll understand it once You've beaten the game 10th time..Have a nice time playing this amazing game!-Circumflex			",241,17,11,16,17,2,13

												I have a personal connection with this game because it combined something I love which is videogames & something I hate which is religion. This game is a breath of fresh air against all the crap in religion & I honestly recommend this game if you have a gloomy day or you just want to let off some steam so if you like classic Zelda games & you hate religion go play this game.

												Binding of Isaac is a shooter game with heavy inspiration from The Legend of Zelda and various roguelikes. It features permanant death, so you have to stay focused while playing. You must dodge monsters and destroy them with your tears, collecting randomly dropped items scattered around the randomly generated dungeons. I've made it to the final boss, but have yet to beat it, and likely will not because I am waiting for the remake of Binding of Isaac to come out before I spend more time playing it. You could easily compare this to Teleglitch, but that game is a lot less random in terms of the items you find and enemies you encounter (even the boss progression is somewhat random in Binding of Isaac).Still, if you like what you see in videos on Youtube, etc... you can't go wrong for the price, and I do recommend this version until the remake is available.

												Perhaps the best indie game I've played to date. The Binding of Isaac is such an addictive game. One of the reasons why it is so addictive is with every initiation of the game, it is randomised, and therefore remains refreshing on every playthrough. It's good that its like this, since there's a long progression path to unlocking everything and unlocking platinum god. This game is a must have. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game during my Freshman Year of High School, I can honestly say this game ruined my life. I bought it around the time of Midterms. Boy, how i screwed myself over. I failed every single final, but it was all worth it because I have at least 50% of all the achievements. I was barely seen at dances. I regret nothing. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I fell into my basement, I noticed a bunch of flies and other enemies appear I use my tears to kill them. I encounter a room with some things with a bunch of flies, but in his mouth. I kill him with sadness, I fall. Rinse and repeat, I get to my mom, I kill her, but she is not dead. I then fall into her womb, as if I am being reborn. I get to my mother's heart, I kill it. A chest appears, the only reward for killing my mother. I open it, it contains a fez. This game is alright I say, 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game. Truly awesome graphics with perfect gameplay. It is very difficult for me though; when I bought the game I bought the DLC (Wrath of the Lamb) with it and you cannot turn the DLC off. The DLC makes it much harder so it's taking me some time to adapt but it is still extremely fun. Great game, especially for it's price of $5. You cannot find anything better for it's price. It is much better than many $10 - $20 I've played! This is a must-buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not for everyone. It's tough as nails and very dependant on luck. If you like roguelikes, exploration, and finding great combos, this is the game for you. Don't touch it if you prefer more casual experiences, if dying bothers you or if you don't like starting for the beginning on each run, without saves.Once you put that aside, it has a very deep meaning hidden behind those cartoonish graphics. The game will keep you on your toes, making you wonder what's next and how to overcome them. Even in adversity, a little of good luck can turn the tide of the battle, and making poor decisions is punishing.However, as you play, you'll develop new strategies, and find combinations and combinations of items that are going to help you survive the horrid world that is the basement. You'll get beams, lasers, chocolate and more to fight your enemies, which get increasingly hard. Even with bad luck, good reflexes and strategy will make you survive each run. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am really liking this new trend of 'Roguelikes For Actual People'. This is essentially a mash between Zelda and a roguelike. It also has a lot of creepiness attached to it. It's also a ♥♥♥♥ of a lot of fun. You walk into rooms, cry at monsters until they die, take their things, cry at a big monster, die, reload, enjoy. It's simple but effective as hell, mainly because there's always something you haven't seen just yet and the tension when going into a new room is high.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I passed up on this game a while ago because I wasn't entirely sure about it. Just a while ago, I purchased the game for $5 on Steam and started playing it. This game is extremely fun. There is no reason for anyone who likes games to not get this game. The game costs $5 and I've already played it longer than some $20-$40 games.STORY:You play as Isaac, a small child who has been thrown into the basement under his house after his mother supposedly heard a message from god telling her to sacrifice her son. You, as Isaac, must traverse the basement, going deeper and deeper in an effort to survive the horrors in the depths below.GAMEPLAY:The game takes place from a Birds-eye viewpoint, and you control Isaac using WASD and his tear shots using the arrow keys or the mouse. His tears can shoot in 4 cardinal directions (NSEW) and are used as Isaacs primary attack. On your way, there are secret rooms to find coins, shops to purchase items, treasure rooms to get new abilities, boss rooms to fight bosses, devil rooms to give up some hearts for a rare and special item, and so forth. The game has enough variety to keep me coming back for more and trying to perfect my ""run"".GRAPHICS:The game uses a sort-of cutesy vector graphics format, which works well in contrast of the dark undertones of the game. Elements and enemies that need to stand out do so, while things that aren't as important don't attract your eyes attention, something very important in games similar to The Binding of Isaac.BALANCE:The Binding of Isaac is well balanced, but it is easier to talk about what is not balanced rather than talk about what is. Tears Upgrades tend to be rather useless, as they are outshadowed in usefullness by their bigger brother ""The Damage Upgrade"", and the knockback produced from tears can go out of control with enough tears upgrades, sending enemies flying in all directions and making it harder to dodge. The game is also based on luck quite a bit, from the upgrades you draw to the rooms that you find, but it also requires a lot of skill, something you earn from playing the game. Additionally, some of the upgrades just plain suck. Other than that, the game is well balanced.OVERVIEW:The Binding of Isaac is a Birds-Eye dungeon crawler with a fantastic concept and huge buckets of replayability. This game would be high up on my Top 10 Favorite Games list if I had one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having just gotten 100% on this game, I think it's time that I give my review. To put it simply, this is my favorite game. Period. Since everything in the game is quite literally random (room layout, floor layout, power-ups, items, enemies, bosses etc.) it provides an immense level of replayability. I have put 270 hours into this game and have had to start from scratch due to a corrupted save and still I absolutely love it and play it nearly every day.I always love a high level of challenge and difficulty and The Binding of Isaac provides this in SPADES.At $8 for the game and the DLC (which is essential, in my opinion) this game is a great value. Better yet, it is often on sale for a couple dollars and this makes it a MUST BUY if you also enjoy a challenging and highly replayable game.			",335,130,2,49,24,4,41

												The concept behind this game is ridiculously easy to grasp. It's dark, it's light hearted, and you can literally play it forever. It has replay value through the roof, a ton of bosses and items that continually add to the game the more you play it, and it can be incredibly challenging.

												A great game. Truly awesome graphics with perfect gameplay. It is very difficult for me though; when I bought the game I bought the DLC (Wrath of the Lamb) with it and you cannot turn the DLC off. The DLC makes it much harder so it's taking me some time to adapt but it is still extremely fun. Great game, especially for it's price of $5. You cannot find anything better for it's price. It is much better than many $10 - $20 I've played! This is a must-buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From the makers of Super Meat Boy comes this great, terryifyingly bizarre game. This game mixes overhead third person shooting with the dungeon exploration of the original Legend of Zelda. The is is a roguelike, meaning it has RPG like stats, randomly generated levels, and if you die you have to start all over. Various enemies require strategy and skill, and the bosses have the game feeling like a SHUMP bullet hell game at times. There are TONS of items and skills, that boost stats, changes your ammo, or giving you unique skills like shooting through walls. The game varies difficulty, sometimes being a walk in the park or frustratingly difficult, but it's pick up and play style mixed with the short game time and endless replayability make this a great game at a very cheap price.

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those games that grows on you. The first time I played Isaac I remember being frustrated and felt that I wasted two dollars. I never bothered to play beyond the basement. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what initially put me off from Isaac, but I chalk up my ignorance to an inability to progress. I didn't enjoy losing and quickly concluded the game was simply not for me. A couple years later one I was introduced to a livestreamer named LethalFrag. He often loaded up Binding of Isaac; one of his favorite games. While playing he often spoke highly of Isaac's replayability, soundtrack, and addictive gameplay. His praise helped me realize that Isaac deserved another look; and now I couldn't agree more with his assessment.  To appreciate The Binding of Isaac I needed to make some progress and unlock items. Dying stopped being so horrible as I faced each challenge and overcame them step by step. I understood that it was perfectly acceptable to lose; that's just part of the process. The trick was to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes. From there I was able to immerse myself in the gameplay. I've now logged over one hundred hours into the original Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb. I still find myself coming back for more. With the release of Rebirth I play the original far less often, but the newest ""Eternals"" update has got me back for what I expect will be another 100+ hours. TL;DR: The Binding of Isaac is unquestionably the best investment I've ever made on Steam. There's still plenty to appreciate, though Rebirth is now a much smoother experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am really liking this new trend of 'Roguelikes For Actual People'. This is essentially a mash between Zelda and a roguelike. It also has a lot of creepiness attached to it. It's also a ♥♥♥♥ of a lot of fun. You walk into rooms, cry at monsters until they die, take their things, cry at a big monster, die, reload, enjoy. It's simple but effective as hell, mainly because there's always something you haven't seen just yet and the tension when going into a new room is high.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have spend over 90 hours on this game, that might seem like nothing but I'm telling You. From the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out bombs, stealing moms panties, wearing a heart around my neck that looks like a raw ball sack this game just has the right amount of WTF for me to say. "" Hey, hey there strange christian, bible loving mommes boy, what it going to be today, Are you going to wear a peice of poop on your head today or are we going to put on moms lips stick and high heels and look like a sad little cross dresser who pops pills and eats lard"" Sound like the perfect child hood to me			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Little late to the party, but I want to try out this new ""Steam Reviews"" thing by reviewing The Binding of Isaac. Contrary to popular belief, The Binding of Isaac is not hard, more, unforgiving. Many will be turned off by the nature of reviews stating it is hard and requires much skill. I find it, however, more unforgiving than ""hard"". Yes, there is a difference.""Well, what do you mean?"", says random bystander awed by hearing other's analysis being gone against. Well, you see, anyone who has played The Binding of Isaac can tell you it is a randomly generated game. This aspect gives it a very nice value of replayablility. Luck is a key factor in this generation, so you want a ""lucky"" run. However, anyone with a lot of skill CAN beat this game with crappy items. You see, the challenge does not stem from its risky 1 life gameplay style, as you can restart and get better items, possibly a 1-up to give you another life, the challenge comes from the random generation and♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of projectiles. However, you can master this game. Like I said before, you can use your skill to beat this game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items. Some strategies such as Secret Room guessing, and knowing how to avoid certain items really helps a lot. The secret to beating this game is to be immersed in its content and variables.  ""So what? You can beat the game if you take into consideration your knowledge of this game. What makes you think more people will buy it?"", says a bystander who keeps getting owned by Peeps. Well, you see, The Binding of Isaac has had a reputation for being an infamously hard game. The real ironic thing is, people can beat it in their first few runs. Then more content unlocks, and they gradually keep becoming better at the game. The game is not hard, its just a thing you can't plow through. I hope this will help people off put by the game's reputation as ""hard"" join in on the fun. I'm sorry this isn't much of a review, I'm really busy (With doing nothing) and I can't be bothered to write a full review. Though to truly know this game, you must play it yourself. Bye, and I hope to see you all again in 2014.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So many different ways to play this game, so much verity between each of the different play-throughs. It's incredibly hard to finish the game the first few times but when you get more and more used to the style of game and dodging enemies instead of being destructive and offensive, you'll be okay. Rebirth will be out soon anyway, so play both!			",214,25,0,35,11,0,9

												The Binding of Isaac is a easy and fun RPG Shooter. The controls are easy to pick up in a short amount of time. The radomization makes you keep intrest every time, and the items also add some spice to the game. The story isn't too bad either for what it's going for. I would really advise you to play it as it's a game with never ending fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Bnding of Issac is a (like most people all it) a Zelda-like dungeon crawler. Yep, damn straight that's what it is. While this game is awesome, there are a few things that I have issues with. Let's start with the good things, shall we? Okay, the art style is awesome! I love the cartoony yet dark feel this game has to it. While it is a game that is dead serious, it's pretty funny with all of it's power-ups (which there are a frigging ton of) and bosses. Oh and good GOD ALMIGHTY that soundtrack. The music is creepy and also very catchy. PLUS! Every dungeon/ basement or whatthe♥♥♥♥ ever is random EVERY TIME, making every playthrough different. The characters and story are cool and funny (and down-right terrifying sometimes) and the enemies are also creepy and sometimes cute-ish. Now, those 'bad things' I said earlier? They really don't matter; but here we go. First, it's a flash game; therefore, it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥(for me. I have an awfull computer). The lag, yes, can really pull me from the game, but it's something I get used to. And finally is that a lot of the power-ups are kindda crappy. But all-in-all, it's a great game, and I can easily recomend everyone to it.     Final Score=8.75/10Edit: I got Windows 8.1 and somehow my game runs like 50% better. Final FINAL Score =9.75/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ok so il explain this game quickly, you play as Isaac a little kid who fires tears at enemys in his basement to kill them, it is a very hard game it has taking me 194 hours to 100% it, although it is filled with unlockable items and charecters which keeps it fresh each time you play it, although it uses the layout of the original legend of zelda dungeons i overall recommend this game but only if you get it with the wrath of the lamb expansion pack.

												Brilliant game! Very fun, with tons of replay value. So many items and randomly generated floors make the game very different each time, also the art is great. 9/10 I would have given it a 10/10 but achievements on mac do not work, so I had to login on a windows computer for my achievements to register, due to the achievements file being a .exe file, which mac cannot open. Otherwise great game, definitely recommended :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I passed up on this game a while ago because I wasn't entirely sure about it. Just a while ago, I purchased the game for $5 on Steam and started playing it. This game is extremely fun. There is no reason for anyone who likes games to not get this game. The game costs $5 and I've already played it longer than some $20-$40 games.STORY:You play as Isaac, a small child who has been thrown into the basement under his house after his mother supposedly heard a message from god telling her to sacrifice her son. You, as Isaac, must traverse the basement, going deeper and deeper in an effort to survive the horrors in the depths below.GAMEPLAY:The game takes place from a Birds-eye viewpoint, and you control Isaac using WASD and his tear shots using the arrow keys or the mouse. His tears can shoot in 4 cardinal directions (NSEW) and are used as Isaacs primary attack. On your way, there are secret rooms to find coins, shops to purchase items, treasure rooms to get new abilities, boss rooms to fight bosses, devil rooms to give up some hearts for a rare and special item, and so forth. The game has enough variety to keep me coming back for more and trying to perfect my ""run"".GRAPHICS:The game uses a sort-of cutesy vector graphics format, which works well in contrast of the dark undertones of the game. Elements and enemies that need to stand out do so, while things that aren't as important don't attract your eyes attention, something very important in games similar to The Binding of Isaac.BALANCE:The Binding of Isaac is well balanced, but it is easier to talk about what is not balanced rather than talk about what is. Tears Upgrades tend to be rather useless, as they are outshadowed in usefullness by their bigger brother ""The Damage Upgrade"", and the knockback produced from tears can go out of control with enough tears upgrades, sending enemies flying in all directions and making it harder to dodge. The game is also based on luck quite a bit, from the upgrades you draw to the rooms that you find, but it also requires a lot of skill, something you earn from playing the game. Additionally, some of the upgrades just plain suck. Other than that, the game is well balanced.OVERVIEW:The Binding of Isaac is a Birds-Eye dungeon crawler with a fantastic concept and huge buckets of replayability. This game would be high up on my Top 10 Favorite Games list if I had one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game with the DLC for something around 0.65€ on sale (lol, almost for free!), but it offers far more than you'd expect from the game costing so little. At first I was like:""Dude, what the F. There's poop everywhere, disgusting stuff..."" and all that....but I gave this game a chance, and I sincerely don't have any regrets. Of course, it has its minor flaws - Flash makes this game little bit slow.BUT: the gameplay is excellent, it has brilliant OST that will never get boring, it's highly addictive.Rebirth (renewed version) is much more better-er, but if you can't afford it, this one will do just fine too.

One of the reasons why it is so addictive is with every initiation of the game, it is randomised, and therefore remains refreshing on every playthrough. It's good that its like this, since there's a long progression path to unlocking everything and unlocking platinum god. This game is a must have. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Простая, но в тоже время интересная аркада с случайной генерацией мира, потрясающей рисовкой и отличным саундтреком. Самое забавное то, что порой, игру  можно пройти за 15-20 минут, если имеется хороший дроп вещей, однако также можно отсоосать у первого же босса, если не повезет. Короче. всем рекомендую.

												This game is great, controls work well, and it has a neat art style. It's also a pretty hard game to beat and you have to depend on luck for the items you obtain throughout the game. But that's basically the fun of it, you have a lot of items to pick up and use and some may be bad and some may be good. With multiple endings, great enemies and bosses, and different types of characters with different stats and abilities. This game overall is great.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I am shocked at this game; from a religious standpoint I'd have to say it is utterly perfect for my fellow Christian players to enjoy; 10/10, recommend it, God Bless You.This addictive randomly generated dungeon crawler is absolutely stunning, though it is very simple and lacking in depth (I'd like some more bosses and items, maybe my wish will be granted in Rebirth) it continues to entertain for hours and hours. Every time I thought I will play one game more and was stuck for another 20 hours. If you compare the cost and the time played; this is definitely worth it and a fun game to play if you're watching a film on the other side of your screen, so simple yet so much fun!I would say more about the references, humour and plot but I'll just let you find that out for yourself, the game is barely a fiver, just get it already.

												Now, I've never been a huge fan of the top-down rogue-like genre of gaming...Until I played The Binding of Isaac! <3Indifferent at first, I watched a friend of mine dungeon crawl his way through room after room, fighting off hordes of twisted, gnarled and deranged looking monsters, spiders, flies... even the harbingers of the apocalypse themselves! It was at this point my interest was peaked...I hadn't given the game much thought before that, and so decided to try it out for myself. Instantly hooked...Since then, I've not stopped! While frustrating at times, practice makes perfect. I soon got a handle on the game and have since moved on to the sequel (The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth), which only got better from there.Gameplay 10/10Soundtrack 10/10Replay Value 10/10Social Life 0/10Would definitely recommend trying it out!

												The name Isaac is derived from a Hebrew word that means '' He laughs '' which is ironic since the character that you play kills his enemies with his own tears. If that isn't unsettling enough, the game itself is inspired by the biblical story of the binding of Isaac, where a father (Abraham) is commanded by God to sacrifice his son, Isaac. (In this case, Isaac's mother hears God who commands her to kill him to purge him of all his sins, yikes).Please, do not shy away from this game from all the religious undertones and various symbolisms scattered throughout it, because The Binding of Isaac is so much more than that.After playing it for 230 hours, I was finally able to 100% the game. Some players might take more time to achieve this and some less. And I can strongly say, this is a very well constructed and very addictive game that offers much replayability and challenges, especially for such a low price (DLC a must!). It's a rogue-like ''zelda-esque'' game with randomly generated floors, rooms, items, enemy fights and bosses. It's the type of game that, indeed, has to do with luck but also skill. While everything is somehow random, by learning what items do and how to fully take advantage of all the tools and mechanics the game offers, you will eventually become comfortable adventuring floors with each playthrough.The game will be frustrating and very hard, but when you finally get your first win, it's oh so satisfiying ^w^b and it can only get better from there hehehe...

Equal parts disgusting and hilarious, you'll always be surprised at what you'll find when you're a new player.  The Wrath of the Lamb DLC is a must, though you might want to play through the original first just to see how much great change was put into tWotL.

												This game is disturbing like real freaking disturbing. Example you can grow a malformed head and cry tears of blood at crap  that contains hidden hearts and money. whoever made this game must have been a psychopath or a abused kid because whole concept of mother trying to kill you while you run around in the basement is really messed up. However i love the depth of the items and the game is always so cheap. Highly reccomend.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This title is fantastic.  I will always keep coming back and playing it over and over. The overall difficulty balance is great. You never can feel too confident or too beaten down.  Binding of Isaac will always be here for me when I need a good solid challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is one of those games that grows on you. The first time I played Isaac I remember being frustrated and felt that I wasted two dollars. I never bothered to play beyond the basement. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what initially put me off from Isaac, but I chalk up my ignorance to an inability to progress. I didn't enjoy losing and quickly concluded the game was simply not for me. A couple years later one I was introduced to a livestreamer named LethalFrag. He often loaded up Binding of Isaac; one of his favorite games. While playing he often spoke highly of Isaac's replayability, soundtrack, and addictive gameplay. His praise helped me realize that Isaac deserved another look; and now I couldn't agree more with his assessment.  To appreciate The Binding of Isaac I needed to make some progress and unlock items. Dying stopped being so horrible as I faced each challenge and overcame them step by step. I understood that it was perfectly acceptable to lose; that's just part of the process. The trick was to pick myself up and learn from my mistakes. From there I was able to immerse myself in the gameplay. I've now logged over one hundred hours into the original Binding of Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb. I still find myself coming back for more. With the release of Rebirth I play the original far less often, but the newest ""Eternals"" update has got me back for what I expect will be another 100+ hours. TL;DR: The Binding of Isaac is unquestionably the best investment I've ever made on Steam. There's still plenty to appreciate, though Rebirth is now a much smoother experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games of all time!The binding of Isaac is a rough like game, where you have to go through a sereis of rooms, in order to omplete a level.The game is acually difficult, amnd at times, you will have geat challanges to overcome, like bosses or big pulls of enemyes.The story is simple, you are playing as Isaac (or some of the charectes you can unlock) and has to escape Mom, becouse she is trying to kill you in gods name. The story is not really anything that matters for a game like this, but it is nice to know why Isaac is running around in a creappy basement, full of monsters.The controles are simple, you can move in any direction, and you can shot in four directions, up, down, left and right. Along the way you will find upgrades, that can make you shot in other directions, shot faster, do more damage, gain more life, get friends to shot together with you and many more items.The funny part about the items, is that they don`t tell you, what the item can do. You either have to look at your stats, or try to shot, in order to see what the item did for you. If nothing changes, it can get really diffecult to find out what the item did, and you have to remember what meny items did, so you don`t end up downgrading youself.There are also tarot cards, that do diffrent things like clearing rooms, make enemyes take damage, teleport ypu and many more things.There are diffrent roomes on the map, that do diffrent things.The plain rooms, are just a figting room, you have to kill all the enemeyes in a room, in order to countinue to a nother room.There is a sacrifice room, where you have to take damage, in order to get an item.There is the a shop, where you can buy items for coins, this can be health, weapons, tarot cards, nearly everything.Then there is a secret room, where you have to bomb away a wall, in order to get in. If you don`t have a map that shows you where this room is, you have to bomb random walls.There is an arcade, where you can gamble, with your money and win prices.Then there is a tressure room, where you unlock the door with a key, in order to get an item.And then there is the boss rooms, and this is where the real action happens. To advance in the game, you have to defeat a boss, and the bosses are random selected, based on whitch floor you are on. The bosses can be hard, and some can be easy, but I would say they all are very injoable.So about the diffeculty, it is not only due to hard mobs and bosses, but also becouse it is a rough like game, if you die, you die, no countinues. This can get you very frusterated at times, but it is also the charm of a rough like game. You will end up dying a lot, and if you don`t have the right items, or haven`t found anything speceail, the game will punish you for that.The game has fantastic music! I love evety single track, and I promiss you will too! The music are very atmosferic, and they are good to psyck you up.This is one of my favorite games, it is fun, addicting and overall a fantastc game, thumps up. 8 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game offers gameplay that will punish you for your major mistakes but allows you to learn from the small ones and that is where you grow. Most of the difficulty doesnt come from the enemies or the bosses bt it comes from learning how each item works and how to work with it because most of the items  you pick up you cannot get rid of ,meaning  that if you get an item that you hate you have to deal with it. Needless to say a wiki is a godsend when it comes to items and bosses beause some of the effects of the items are barely noticable unless you pay intense attention. Overall this game offers crushing but addictive gameplay , amazingly high replay value , and multiple endings making you wonder what just happened .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The concept behind this game is ridiculously easy to grasp. It's dark, it's light hearted, and you can literally play it forever. It has replay value through the roof, a ton of bosses and items that continually add to the game the more you play it, and it can be incredibly challenging. While it might not be everyones cup of tea it is definitely worth a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME and rarely anyone dislikes it. And hey, its cheap so you won't lose a lot if you don't like it. You do spend a lot of time playing this game because its SO different everytime you play. Then if you buy the DLC its even MORE different and adds another 100+ hours to the game. Great game.

												This game is too hard and the babies are not edible. I paid $5 for this game and not one child was eaten. There is too much blood, it looks like my grandmother's period.

												This game is hard. Very hard. It throws you right in at the deep end with no knowledge of any of the huge catalogue of items, or enemies you will face, or even the rooms you will go through, but it has so much replay value. I must have played this game at least 1000 times by now, and I'm not even close to being bored, or even finishing the game. There is so much variability in this game's randomely generated rooms, floors, enemies and bosses, and you feel a huge sense of accomplishment every time you beat that tough boss or get past that awful room, and if and when you get lucky with items, you feel unstoppable, until you die, start again, and are as weak and pathetic as you always were. Enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cute/Evil/Rouge/Action with a major shout out, to early Zelda dungeons!Not for the faint of heart, a hardcore title indeed, and quite unforgiving at times. None the less, extremely satisfying to master and dominate. Controls could be tighter, but are sufficient. Huge fan of Edmund, and Florian. I actually started this Steam account, a few years back just to download The Binding of Isaac, and it definitely needs a spot in your indie collection, as well. So please, for the sake of Isaac, BUY this game.			",173,19,2,6,8,1,3

												Dark and twisted. When I was first shown this game, I really didn't know what to think of it. However, this has been one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. In essence the game itself is a fairly fast paced action where your tears are your weapon. The sheer amount of unlockable content is what kept me replaying over and over. Still not 100% the game and I dont think I will do for a while, but it is a game I can see myself going back to for years!Although this is not a traditional genre for me, it was worth the plunge. Rebirth is coming out soon and I cannot wait!			",74,21,0,52,8,1,37

The game is never the same twice, and even if it way, i would still play it.Easy, fluid controls make glacking even the most stubborn fruitflies easy. A wonderful treasure room system changes the face of your character as well as your gaming experiance.

												The Binding of Isaac is a pretty faithful rogue-like title mixed with a twin stick shooter style dungeon crawler. Although rather than using twin analogue sticks you use WSAD and the arrow keys. On paper this only allows 4 directions of fire but the bullets actually respond to your characters momentum so they can be directed diagonally with well planned movement. In addition to being very competent in what it does, The Binding of Isaac has a ridiculous amount of content and secrets to discover.The game plays great and has wonderful replayability, but where it shines is in the background story and the atmosphere. The core theme is a very dark look at a fanatically religious mother and her abused/neglected son. I could easily understand the argument that I'm looking too deep into it, but if you let it get to you I think the story is as impacting and disturbing as the gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is a dark game as you can see in the screenshots. It's very fun (can get out of hand via ER MAH GERD). Can  be quite tricky and trust me its worth buying. Only $5 so super cheap for a game that is really good. NOTE: for all christians out there DO NOT buy this game because it includes Demons, the seven sins from the bible and your mum heard a voice of god saying to kill Isaac but if you want it, you have been warned! But still great game, I crafted the badge because it was great and I think i'll give it 10/10. This game was outstanding with the design in levels. Worth buying so get your wallets out and add $5 to steam and buy it!			",113,12,4,5,8,0,7

												Binding of Isaac has provided me with one of the most frustrating, yet funnest and most addicting game experiences ever. This is the only game where you can defeat devil himself and die to a fly in the next room. Then swear to uninstall the game or swing at your computer but after 5 seconds proceed to play 10 more games.Game has a lot of replay value because of its randomized features and several unlockable characters, multiple endings, tons of enemy types and items and big learning curve.The music is superb, and the art style is charmingly disturbing as is the story. Overall I recomend this game 100% to everyone who can get past the bizarre aesthetic and sometimes irritating rogue like elements.			",48,22,1,18,7,0,11

												I have had this game for around 2 years now and oh my god do i love it, When i lost my internet for over a year this game was the main reason i stayed sane, regardless of the fact steam says i have about 240 hours clocked on the game in actual fact it is closer to 1500 hours.The first ever time i played this game i hated it, i despised its difficulty and lack of explination for the items. It wasnt untill i didnt play it for about a week after my first time that i started to feel an urge to play it again ( it doesnt help that i was watching a lot of streams of a guy who played it a lot) and this time when i went back to the game i found my self enjoying the game, yeah i was still dieing a hella load ( i think i had around 40 deaths before i killed moms foot for the first time) but i wasnt raging about it, i was just thinking "" huh so thats what this little bugger does well imma getcha next time mister""  and with the randomness of the items and the lackj of explination of what they do, i felt my self enjoying finding new items and figuring out what they do on my own, like an adventure, it was a sad day when i knew what all the items and trinkets and cards did.  For those who are checking this game out because of rebirth i highly recommend you get  this game and play it first, it is a great way to get the feel how the game plays and what it was like before we got them fancy pancy 16 bit graphicsReveiw word of the day : Randomness			",318,113,4,55,22,6,25

												Quick, dynamic and full of various content. Expect to play this game for hours and hours if you plan to collect every single item... and otherwise! Quite addictive and ridicously cheap for this price considering the content you will get.Only downsides to the game are the inabbility to save content(which I guess is in the spirit of the whole experience) and the lack of controller support which can be sorted out using JoyToKey which is even neatly suggested in the options.All in all I give this game 8/10 and strongly reccommend to any Super Meat Boy fan and a challenge seeker.

												At first, once I bought this game, I thought it was quite fun, but quickly it sort of just became one of the games that I don't usually play. When that point in time is reached where you don't really feel like playing The Binding of Isaac anymore, it becomes a great game to play in short, spare time because of quick play. It requires you to really, not use tactics (doesn't help when you can't see what's in the rooms next to you), but to think about how you want to approach the game. This idea of 'approaching the game' includes: the character you choose to play (which affects much of how you play, depending on their stats) or the risks that you wish to take in the hopes of gaining a higher benefit. It might not seem very understandable in the way that I've put it, but any past players of this game should realise what I'm trying to say.This game has a lot to offer for players who want a difference and a challenge compared to other games. Nevertheless, the Binding of Isaac is a brilliant game and I recommend it to anyone that wishes to purchase this game.			",72,4,0,1,4,0,8

												If you liked Super Meat Boy, you'll love this game. The art style and punishing roguelike difficulty are attributed to the geniuses that are Edmund McMillen (of Team Meat) and Florian Himsl. The game is accompanied by the beautiful musical stylings of Danny Baranowsky (who also scored Super Meat Boy). Imagine Legend of Zelda, dungeons only, one life, with a dark, ""cute-grotesque"" art style. The more you play, the more items you'll be able to use. The more times you complete the game, the further you can progress. I can not recommend this game enough. Continually patched to add new things and fix bugs. The replayability is endless.

												Twisted comedy, endless replayability and hundrads of upgrades make the Binding of Issac one of my most played games. It is a dark twisted roguelike mixed with a layout lifted from the original zelda leading to simple controlls and easy to learn concepts with an ochean of underlieing complexity. Due to its random nature no two runs are the same and while I cant say the Asthetic is for everyone, if you are even slightly interested i would strongly suggest you give it a whirl.

												This game... Oh goodness, this game.The basis for this game originates around a small story in the bible, where Abraham is told to kill his son, as an act of obedience; His son's name, of course is Isaac. Upon almost achieving this goal, an angel stops him, letting him know it was merely a test. It is known as one of the most controversial bits of the bible, so I assume that's what sparked the creator's desire to make this game.Your journey begins when your mother hears a voice from ""god"", asking a sacrifice of her son to prove her faith. Isaac hides by dropping into a newly found trapdoor and finds himself in the dangerous pit of the basement. There, he finds what could have been, and what probably will be.This saddening and dark atmosphere is lightened by it's sadistic power-up lineup and cartoony artwork. Items you can grab will give you benefits and change how your character looks, often leading to some crude jokes. Terrifying bosses aren't always this game's goal, instead it lets the gameplay do the talking. Often you'll find yourself not properly equipped to face up a certain room or boss. It really drives the helplessness of Isaac home.You can do multiple runs of this game, with each one never being a copy of one before. Sure, the same items have a chance of appearing, but it ultimately feels like it's own unique run. You may be doomed from the start, or destined for victory; It all depends on your skill and luck.The Wrath of the Lamb DLC provides a whopping amount of content. It introduces a new item type, adds new mobs, new floors and bosses, the works. It's essentially a new game.This game is worth the full $8 to experience it all. Try it out yourself, you won't be disappointed!9.3/10 (Buy it. Now.) - WolfHero			",136,28,6,24,6,1,15

												The Binding of Isaac is a frustratingly-fun and challenging zelda-style rogue-lite, created by Edmund McMillen (Super Meat Boy) and Florian Himsl (Coil, The C-Word).The game features a ton of variables in the forms of characters, bosses, items, and power-ups, all of which can alter how much you progress throughout the game.With hilarious (and sometimes creepy) references to faith, religion, human ethics, and biology, Isaac is a delicious slice of blasphemy, served with a sour lemon.

												NOTE: Please buy the 'Wrath of the Lamb' DLC if you're going to get this. It will make TBoI a million times better, and will allow you to update the game to get the Hard Mode.With randomly generated dungeons for every playthrough and a top down dungeon crawling experience in the same vein of the original Zelda trilogy, The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike game that can be picked up for less than a dollar and provides hours and hours of fun on end.Following Isaac, a young boy who is trying to defeat his murderous mother after almost getting killed by her, TBoI has hundreds of items, ranging from the cutest of fashion accessories to the most grotesque parasites and diseases. With a randomisation system that makes no two playthroughs the same, TBoI is an adventure, a big step forward in the world of indie gaming, and ultimately, you'll have a hell of a time playing it.My criticisms with the game are that it's impossible to predict what items you're going to get, and while this adds to the mystery, this also means you can become obscenely OP or obscenely UP and it can become frustrating having to play through with what could be called a dead weight on your leg, which combined with the VERY steep learning curve, makes for a frustrating time with some playthroughs. Nonetheless, with a game that you can pick up for less than one dollar, where can you go wrong? I highly reccommend TBoI, and if you like it, go pick up the remake, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth!

												If a game where you shoot poop with your projectile tears to get tiny blue hearts for sustanence can keep so many people entertained for hundreds of hours each, it is something special. It has simple mechanics and is easy to get into for any gamer who likes to be constantly challenged. People who have played thousands of hours of this game can still pick it up at any time for a run. Not to mention its price, which at times of sale can be as low as 2 dollars WITH the DLC. There is no reason for everybody to not have this game already.			",202,78,1,37,15,1,16

												Edmund Mcmillian, you did another successful job of making another indie game. Binding of Isaac is an adventure and a lot of relegious things including the title. The story gets better and makes more sensesince the beginning isnt enough. The story is about you (Isaac) and your mother just chillin until your mother thinks God is talking to her and tells her to get rid of everything in your life since they are sins of his life. So she obeyed 'God' and took everything in Isaac's life (including his cloths and your naked the whole game). 'God' now tells her to go KILL Isaac if she truly loves 'God' more than Isaac. Well guess what she literally grabbed a knife and attempted to barge in his room. Luckly, Isaac finds a basement door in his room and your adventure starts.As you go through the basement, you encounter enemies which you kill them by SHOOTING YOUR OWN TEARS (total logic).You also find items which most of them help you by increasing speed, length of tears and damage. and give you wings.There are special rooms like stores, death chambers and challenge rooms this is how you get to those 3 rooms:Store: open it with a key or if theres a secret room beside it, just cheat and blow up the wall beside the store.Death Chamber: a room with only spikes, if your stupid enough (joke) to go to the spike and attempt to kill yourself, you actually can make a chest appear.Challenge room: if you beat the room beside the challenge room without taking damage, you can get in.Health in this game is hard to get since you start with 3 hearts and finding them wont be easy. Now let's see how long you can survive under your house besides being a 2-floor basement.I give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficulity and the most shocking thing about the game is that theres 7 characters (all mentioned in the bible) and you gotta beat the entire game 32 TIMES IN TOTAL. So have fun i know you can do it (not).			",112,15,3,18,10,0,15

												I played the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. Pretty nice dungeon crawler that has Zelda 1 like dungeons that are different each time you play, but still keeps some things similiar. The difficulty sure is a challenge and very entertaining. because each playthrough is different, this game has a high replayability value. Also you unlock multiple characters with different abilities. The DLC is worth every cent too and the Soundtrack is fantastic.What i personally dislike however is the giant overuse of internet references and memes, the game tries a little too often to be funny without actually coming uo with real humor, mostly just relying on internet memes from 8 years ago.Great game nonetheless, can recommend this one.

												Despite the fun and animaded visual of the game its most disturbisg. The story itself about a religious mother who drives insane and try to kill her son, and then the creatures that the kid see in the world in his basement. Its amazing all the ideas that flows throw the monsters and the game.			",71,11,0,5,0,0,0

												Lovingly frustrating but hampered by the flash engine.I love this game. Great artstyle, music and challenge. Finding out what items do and how they work together is joyous. The flash engine can be a pain sometimes and has slowdown from time-to-time as a result but that still can't completely take away from how fun this game is.Buy it.			",133,43,4,27,14,2,7

												Surprisingly fun, extremely satisfying, and utterly brilliant.The Binding of Issac is a mind-bogglingly simple, yet amazing game. Every dungeon is different, and so are the bosses. The game is never the same twice, and even if it way, i would still play it.Easy, fluid controls make glacking even the most stubborn fruitflies easy. A wonderful treasure room system changes the face of your character as well as your gaming experiance. I got a wire coathanger and eneded up having it shoved through my head!A fun, refreshingly unique game i'd recommend to anyone!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is perhaps one of the most poorly coded games I've had the pleasure of playing and, despite that, I would heartily recommend it over most AAA titles.The game operates on the premise that your mother is out to kill you and you are trying to escape horrible, horrible death. So, you jump into the basement. This is where the game earns its keep. Isaac is a 2-D Top Down Shooter with randomly generated levels where death means the end of a run and your success can largely depend on the luck of the items randomly generated within those levels.The game is pretty much about avoiding damage while clearing rooms while finding upgrades so you can win the game. It rarely approaches the level of bullethell dodging, but mostly just relies on sheer variety of enemies & bosses to kill you, whether through that one bullet you walked into or the one fly who you ignored who rammed into you. Still, it's pretty much all dodgeable at the end of the day, with a few unfair moments. Still, that's what makes this roguelike so much fun.			",474,157,14,84,57,3,113

												If a game where you shoot poop with your projectile tears to get tiny blue hearts for sustanence can keep so many people entertained for hundreds of hours each, it is something special. It has simple mechanics and is easy to get into for any gamer who likes to be constantly challenged. People who have played thousands of hours of this game can still pick it up at any time for a run. Not to mention its price, which at times of sale can be as low as 2 dollars WITH the DLC. There is no reason for everybody to not have this game already.			",202,78,1,37,15,1,16

												I'm just waiting for the nice men in white suits to escort me to rehab. In the mean time, I thought I would share my experience with future addicts.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It will destroy your life.I have lost sleep, skipped meals and needed to invest in a pee bag because of this atrocity. At no point during the research process was I warned that buying this game would result in a heroin-level addiction.If all the above hyperbole isn't a clear enough indication, this game is amazing, and Edmund McMillen is an evil genuis.You play as Isaac, a creative, imaginitive little boy who plays by himself and draws pictures while his mother watches Christian programming. One day The Lord(TM) speaks to her and asks her to kill Isaac to prove her faith. In his attempts to escape, Isaac finds his way into a cellar conveniently located underneath his bedroom. Now, his only way to escape is to venture down into the depths and battle his way through the hoardes of abominations that wait for him.As you join Isaac on his journey, you will find a multitude of upgrades and items that can help or hinder him on his quest to escape his lunatic mother and battle the wide variety of monsters that stand between him and that ultimate goal. This includes but is not limited to eating pills you find on the ground, consuming dog food (YUM!) and sticking toothpicks through your eyelids.In short, stock up on Slim-jims and Redbull, strap on a pee bag and prepare for one wild trip.PROS:-The controls couldn't get much simpler. Every time I play it brings me back to the days when I would blow my entire allowance on double-joystick arcade machines.-Wide range of upgrades, items, enemies and bosses.-Almost endless replayability.-The game is challenging, but not unfair. Victories are infinitely satisfying, failures only harden your resolve to do better on the next playthrough.-Battle enemies, put out fires and clean sh!t up with the power of tears!-The game is packed full of references, dark humor and WTFness that will make you LOL.CONS:-Despite the simple level and character designs, there are frequent drops in frame-rate when there are more than four enemies on screen. However, I wonder if this was a design choice rather than a bug, as this has resulted in Matrix-level projectile dodging in multiple playthroughs.-The noises some of the enemies make can be grating, but they tend to be dispatched so quickly that this isn't much of an issue.-The humor and themes presented in this game are not for everyone. If you're one of those Little House on the Prairie types, you expereience heart palpitations when people tell off-color jokes, or you take the Christian faith very seriously, choose a different title. This one is almost guaranteed to offend your delicate sensibilities.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Christianity is a religion of peace and love"" they said...This little piece of artwork called Binding of Isaac is a really enjoyable game in its simplicity. Longevity is definitely his strong point, thanks to the mechanical ""roguelike"" which allows the player to deal with the levels in a different way, with power-ups, items, monsters and rooms mixed in an infinite number of combinations. The difficulty level is high and changes according to the characters that you will use to play. The sound goes well with the game and the graphic is nice in its simplicity, although sometimes you run into serious fps drop's. PROS: Nice concept The graphic and sound are enjoyable A lot of collectibles that can modify your gameplay Levels are different every time You can loose a lot of time playing this gameCONS: Technically not perfect Sometimes could be frustrating Some objects are really useless ",200,31,3,32,22,4,29

												The binding of Isaac is a brilliant little procedurally generated dungeon crawler in which you must make it through each level of your toy box in order to defeat your mother. This game recquires huge levels of concentration and multi-tasking as you'll be ducking around to avoid flies and enemy tears. This game however is not as innocent as it looks though as if you fail or make the slightest mistake it may come back to bite you later when you need just the tinniest part of health. Anyway this game is an amazing sign of just what a small group of people can achieve and you can see to this day that edmund mcmillin has created many of amazing games. This game is perfect for when your kicking back and want just a small dose of this game or want to play hardcore. This is brilliant, I'm giving it a 7.5/10			",30,8,0,2,3,0,0

The Binding of Isaac is a two-dimensional Action-adventure Roguelike game, which preforms amazingly well in it's Genre. I will breakdown the components of the game:Story - 9/10The Binding of Isaac's storyline is based off the eponymous Bible story. Isaac (a kid) and his mother live in a small home situated on a hill, both peacefully keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing doodles and playing with his toys while his mother watches Christian broadcasts on the television. Isaac's mother then hears ""a voice from above"", stating her son is corrupted and must be helped. It asks her to remove all sin from Isaac to save him. She obliges, and takes away his toys, games and even clothes.The voice again calls out to Isaac's mother, stating Isaac must be isolated from all the evil in the world. Once again, she follows its command and locks Isaac in his room. Finally, the voice speaks to her again, and tells her that she has done good, but it still questions her faith and commands she must sacrifice Isaac. She obliges, grabbing a kitchen knife and goes to Isaac's room. Isaac is watching through a sizable crack in his door and starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor under the rug, and just as his mother bursts in, he opens the trapdoor and jumps down it. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which transitions into the game's title screen.The game has multiple endings, all pointing at different ideas about Isaac's life.Gameplay - 10/10The ingame dungeons are procedurally generated, allowing endless hours of entertainment. It also includes random bosses from a list of over 20, 100+ powerups and items, and 50+ different types of enemies.Sound - 8/10TBOI has a great soundtrack and amazing background music which is highly attractive and creates a great atmosphere in this bizarre game.Overall - 9/10 FYI: I have played a lot more of this game than said by Steam as I have played the DRM free version.

												tldr:6/10 - A rather mediocre top-down rogue action game with dark humor. I keep returning to it when I have a minute and I don't feel like doing anything complex or time consuming. Would absolutely skip if it wasn't on sale. Still very recommended at a reasonable price if you're looking for a simple casual game which is easy to get into.too long part:STORY - ?/10You're playing as Isaac - a little kid whose mom is nuts and wants to kill him, so he descends through a trap door in his room to fight his way through creepy places with creepy monsters in them.GAMEPLAY - 6/10- Simple but hard to master controls. Depends on anyones taste.- The game has its own economy and a SH*TLOAD of upgrades, active skills and consumables to be discovered. Each upgrade and skill is very interesting and fun to mess around with. While it's tempting to google what does what, it's way better fun to just pick something up and see what it does.- Levels are randomized and there is a lot of various monsters and bosses to spice things up. You won't play the game the same way twice.

												I'm just waiting for the nice men in white suits to escort me to rehab. In the mean time, I thought I would share my experience with future addicts.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It will destroy your life.I have lost sleep, skipped meals and needed to invest in a pee bag because of this atrocity. At no point during the research process was I warned that buying this game would result in a heroin-level addiction.If all the above hyperbole isn't a clear enough indication, this game is amazing, and Edmund McMillen is an evil genuis.You play as Isaac, a creative, imaginitive little boy who plays by himself and draws pictures while his mother watches Christian programming. One day The Lord(TM) speaks to her and asks her to kill Isaac to prove her faith. In his attempts to escape, Isaac finds his way into a cellar conveniently located underneath his bedroom. Now, his only way to escape is to venture down into the depths and battle his way through the hoardes of abominations that wait for him.As you join Isaac on his journey, you will find a multitude of upgrades and items that can help or hinder him on his quest to escape his lunatic mother and battle the wide variety of monsters that stand between him and that ultimate goal. This includes but is not limited to eating pills you find on the ground, consuming dog food (YUM!) and sticking toothpicks through your eyelids.In short, stock up on Slim-jims and Redbull, strap on a pee bag and prepare for one wild trip.PROS:-The controls couldn't get much simpler. Every time I play it brings me back to the days when I would blow my entire allowance on double-joystick arcade machines.-Wide range of upgrades, items, enemies and bosses.-Almost endless replayability.-The game is challenging, but not unfair. Victories are infinitely satisfying, failures only harden your resolve to do better on the next playthrough.-Battle enemies, put out fires and clean sh!t up with the power of tears!-The game is packed full of references, dark humor and WTFness that will make you LOL.CONS:-Despite the simple level and character designs, there are frequent drops in frame-rate when there are more than four enemies on screen. However, I wonder if this was a design choice rather than a bug, as this has resulted in Matrix-level projectile dodging in multiple playthroughs.-The noises some of the enemies make can be grating, but they tend to be dispatched so quickly that this isn't much of an issue.-The humor and themes presented in this game are not for everyone. If you're one of those Little House on the Prairie types, you expereience heart palpitations when people tell off-color jokes, or you take the Christian faith very seriously, choose a different title. This one is almost guaranteed to offend your delicate sensibilities.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Christianity is a religion of peace and love"" they said...This little piece of artwork called Binding of Isaac is a really enjoyable game in its simplicity. Longevity is definitely his strong point, thanks to the mechanical ""roguelike"" which allows the player to deal with the levels in a different way, with power-ups, items, monsters and rooms mixed in an infinite number of combinations. The difficulty level is high and changes according to the characters that you will use to play. The sound goes well with the game and the graphic is nice in its simplicity, although sometimes you run into serious fps drop's. PROS: Nice concept The graphic and sound are enjoyable A lot of collectibles that can modify your gameplay Levels are different every time You can loose a lot of time playing this gameCONS: Technically not perfect Sometimes could be frustrating Some objects are really useless ",200,31,3,32,22,4,29

The Binding of Isaac is a two-dimensional Action-adventure Roguelike game, which preforms amazingly well in it's Genre. I will breakdown the components of the game:Story - 9/10The Binding of Isaac's storyline is based off the eponymous Bible story. Isaac (a kid) and his mother live in a small home situated on a hill, both peacefully keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing doodles and playing with his toys while his mother watches Christian broadcasts on the television. Isaac's mother then hears ""a voice from above"", stating her son is corrupted and must be helped. It asks her to remove all sin from Isaac to save him. She obliges, and takes away his toys, games and even clothes.The voice again calls out to Isaac's mother, stating Isaac must be isolated from all the evil in the world. Once again, she follows its command and locks Isaac in his room. Finally, the voice speaks to her again, and tells her that she has done good, but it still questions her faith and commands she must sacrifice Isaac. She obliges, grabbing a kitchen knife and goes to Isaac's room. Isaac is watching through a sizable crack in his door and starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor under the rug, and just as his mother bursts in, he opens the trapdoor and jumps down it. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which transitions into the game's title screen.The game has multiple endings, all pointing at different ideas about Isaac's life.Gameplay - 10/10The ingame dungeons are procedurally generated, allowing endless hours of entertainment. It also includes random bosses from a list of over 20, 100+ powerups and items, and 50+ different types of enemies.Sound - 8/10TBOI has a great soundtrack and amazing background music which is highly attractive and creates a great atmosphere in this bizarre game.Overall - 9/10 FYI: I have played a lot more of this game than said by Steam as I have played the DRM free version.

												tldr:6/10 - A rather mediocre top-down rogue action game with dark humor. I keep returning to it when I have a minute and I don't feel like doing anything complex or time consuming. Would absolutely skip if it wasn't on sale. Still very recommended at a reasonable price if you're looking for a simple casual game which is easy to get into.too long part:STORY - ?/10You're playing as Isaac - a little kid whose mom is nuts and wants to kill him, so he descends through a trap door in his room to fight his way through creepy places with creepy monsters in them.GAMEPLAY - 6/10- Simple but hard to master controls. Depends on anyones taste.- The game has its own economy and a SH*TLOAD of upgrades, active skills and consumables to be discovered. Each upgrade and skill is very interesting and fun to mess around with. While it's tempting to google what does what, it's way better fun to just pick something up and see what it does.- Levels are randomized and there is a lot of various monsters and bosses to spice things up. You won't play the game the same way twice. From this point of view the game offers infinite replayability, but...- The fact that everything is so heavily randomized prevents you from forming any sort of your own strategy. You just dive in and keep going until you win or die. Over time, this reduces the cool variety to the point where you're doing the same thing over and over again and it's only a liiiiiiiittle bit different because of some dice roll. - There is not much persistence to keep you returning for more. There are few unlockable characters and mandatory achievements but upgrades and skills are limited for each run where you find them. While it's nice to know that the game doesn't have you on a leash trying to unlock everything, it doesn't really motivate you to achieve anything when you start from zero every single time.

That's really the only complaint I have. If memes get you angry this is probably not the game for you, but if they actually make you angry you have bigger problems than videogames.Highly recommend, there's a reason it's eaten up 2 entire weeks of my life.

												At first, you start a new game and die. Then, you restart, and die again. But each time you start a new run, you know more, you have more experience and have more stuff unlocked. So, with a bit of luck (as levels are generated randomly), you can progress further. Your runs are longer, you die later, you reach lower levels of the basement and discover more and more of the secrets (and there are plenty of them, believe me).Very addictive and rewarding game, I don't think I've ever played a game in which dying was so motivating to start all over again.

												The Binding of Isaac is similar in a number of ways (difficulty, room layout, enemy types) to the original Legend of Zelda for the NES. The main difference being of course that this game is top-down shooter with largely random item/power-up drops, which changes gameplay considerably. I HEARTILY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a serious challenge, wants massive replay value, and is not going to be driven away by the rogue-like elements and the clever, but unsettling art direction. I've laid out the most pertinent pros and cons below to give a better understanding of whether you'll want to play this game.Pros:Huge replay value (randomization, a number of unique playable characters, additional levels unlocked after beating the game)Great level and enemy design (despite being somewhat derivative of the original Zelda)Medium/High difficulty level (you have to work for it)Brilliant and meaningful achievement system (every achievement unlocks a new item to be obtained in-game)Cons:Occasional fps slowdown when a number of enemies are onscreen (can be fixed by reducing quality settings)Freezes occasionally when loading later levels (simply needs time to fix itself)There are a number of bugs related to ahievement unlocks in Steam, but seems have almost everything right in-game (playthroughs with one character count as wins with another, for example)Art style makes frequent references to abuse and other somewhat taboo themes and can be very unsettling at firstThe sheer number of items available can force a decision between on-the-fly play (with weird item interactions) and having the wiki open in the background to understand your items			",60,23,0,8,5,1,13

												Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and verbal and non-verbal communication, and by restricted, repetitive or stereotyped behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.[2] Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.[3] It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.[4] Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.[5] In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects.[6] Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes, such as heavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines;[7] the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.[8] The prevalence of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report 20 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD as of 2012 (up from 11 per 1,000 in 2008).[7][9][10] The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses;[10] the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.[11] Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.[12] The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then regress.[13] Early behavioral, cognitive, or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.[12] Although there is no known cure,[12] there have been reported cases of children who recovered.[14] Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.[15] An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.[16] ",101,10,2,6,14,3,5

												Pretty awesome game here.  This plus the Wrath of the Lamb DLC will provide many many hours of fun.  It takes a decent bit of learning what items do what, and you'll die a lot, but every run is a fresh take with new things thrown at you.  I really enjoy it and like a good challenge, but sometimes you can just get very unlucky with the drops you're given.  On the other hand you can get very lucky and feel overpowered until you go down deep enough and die anyway from a new boss you haven't fought yet.Overall though, pretty great. 9/10			",214,76,2,42,17,5,42

												A beautifully made game that is amazing in almost every way. Aside from the fact that you can't save, it is still absolutely wonderful! The graphics, design, randomness of the items and location, and the way it increasingly gets difficult. The Binding of Issac pulls you in. It is like an addiction that cannot be satisfied until the game is beaten, and the way that you cannot save just fuels the addiction more to beat the game. Imagine being on the last level fighting against the boss. You are left with only half a heart left and the boss with only less then 6% of health. Almost to the end you get hit. You die. Game over.Time to restart... Again.			",40,3,0,2,11,0,1

												This game is so amazing. It looks really boring to people, but they don't understand. This game is so creative, and challenging! You expect so little of it, but it's just a huge game with so many moments that make you go crazy and so many moments that make you so excited and giggly. There are items that can touch you, personally, and they all have their own meaning. Each boss is different and the further you progress the harder they get. It has so much replay-ability as well! I got Platinum God recently, and it's still fun to play! The Binding of Isaac is by far, my favorite game on Steam, and maybe even my favorite game ever. You really should get it, it's such a journey, and it's so cheap. I can't wait for Rebirth, it's going to be AMAZING, just like this is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really fun game.  You play as a young child who constantly gets bullied by his mother.  He is ridiculed at school and everyone around him defecates on him.  The goal of this game is to progress through floors of your basement in order to kill your mum - the big poo monster.  It is fun to just chill in your house and play.  There is a wide range of items to collect in the game which help you on a run such as trinkets or cards.  There are also 5 characters other than Isaac which are unlocked via various methods.  Overall I would give this an 8.5/10.  The music and visuals are brilliant.  The levels are randomly generated to some extent.  The one downside to me would be that it gets repetitive but the range of characters can make up for it.			",212,26,2,22,14,0,3

												Edmund McMillen is a freaking genius, Part 2. (For Redux version go here.)'Isaac' is simply the best rogue-like I've ever played. Even with slightly more rogue-like experience under my belt now, I still love to go back to this game. It sets the bar freaking high.Released just under a year after Super Meat Boy, with a jumbo DLC expansion another year after that, the game plays like a top-down dungeon-crawler-shooter with randomised levels - no 2 playthroughs are exactly the same! (Unless you use a certain program that can pull the map seeds, but that's a different story.)The base game itself was very good, difficult at first but gets slightly easier as you unlock the more OP items and collectibles. The DLC adds a ton more content. Not to say that the items take away from the difficulty of the game though - some levels with the new Wrath monsters (and quite a few of the old monsters as well) feel somewhat akin to bullet curtain-like games.The only real gripe I have with this is that I cannot save my game mid-way! It's still a small flaw, and one that is corrected in its remake, 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth'. :)In the meantime, to circumvent this during super epic games, I recommend hibernating your computer with the game still running. Okay, well, my computer has survived the hibernation, but I'm not sure about yours...Well, okay, one more gripe - the game engine is in Flash, which is laggy at times and hard to play. For the most part though I didn't have any problems or let that detract from the fun of the game.If you can get this and the DLC for a cheap price, a must buy. It has possibly one of the highest ratios of time spent in game to money spent on game. (Excluding F2Ps, of course.)When to buy In May 2015, an all-new hard mode (Edmund M has called it names ranging from ""Trololololol hell mode"" to ""Florian's ♥♥♥♥ You Mod"") was released for owners of the WotL DLC - and it is hard as heck. You'll probably spend a lot of time trying to beat this mode with all characters, even if you are a veteran. Getting it on a steep discount will give you a lot of hours worth of gameplay for your dollar, but even full price for both game and DLC is not such a bad idea - Florian deserves to be rewarded for his new fiendishly unfair eternal manifestations. I genuinely mean that. It got me to re-look at, and re-evaluate, an old game which I thought I was done with.9.5/10 ",1853,585,65,205,184,24,267

												This game is great. There is a grotesque atmosphere when it comes to the games contents, but the controls are easy and quick to learn. Fans of the gameboy versions of Zelda will find this game to be very enjoyable. There are many similarities between the two games. The game is like a series of dungeons. Each time you beat the dungeon you get one of over 250 power ups. There is a lot of replayability in the game because of the different variations of power ups you can have. Each time you play, it is like starting with a new hero. You just have to make use of what you stumble upon.			",29,6,0,1,0,0,0

												Not sure if I can say anything negative about this game. Backstory, graphics and mechanics all work. After a while it gets boring true but you can just stop there, turn it off and come back to it after a while. You get into action very quick, no long cutscene waits, no loading. Probably after beating the game I'd quit playing it but I couldn't get to that level yet :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possibly the best game that you can buy for less than £1, and the DLC was only 99p too. (at the time of purchase) Vast, with a variety of item combinations, enemies and floor layouts, you'll never play the same game twice! Totally worth your pennies.			",30,1,0,4,4,1,2

												Holy. ♥♥♥♥ing.♥♥♥♥♥♥Look at this game. You see that ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ You see how much ♥♥♥♥ing content it has? That♥♥♥♥♥♥is built in mother♥♥♥♥ing FLASH. If that isn't dope as ♥♥♥♥ then get the hell out of this room.Go on, door is over there.Right, now we got rid of all the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ let's talk about the mother♥♥♥♥ing gameplay.This game is like the first Zelda on ♥♥♥♥ing crack. You shoot ♥♥♥♥ing tears at dead children, fat worms, and the HORSEMEN OF THE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING APOCOLYPSE. You can find items to increase your stats, and Isaac uses them accordingly. For ♥♥♥♥ing example; you find a coat hanger? He sticks it in his head. (As you ♥♥♥♥ing do) You find a noose? He becomes a floating head. You find drugs? You take them. Isaac can become a ♥♥♥♥ing flying head with a nun hood on, sticks keeping his eyes open, demon horns, and have four eyes. If that isn't metal as ♥♥♥♥ then I don't even know WHAT ♥♥♥♥ING IS.Oh, and I haven't even begun on the ♥♥♥♥ing story. This ♥♥♥♥ing kid has a psycho religious mother who wants to kill him because ♥♥♥♥ing god told her to. But that's only the start. There are MULTIPLE ENDINGS TO THIS SWEET♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. YOU HAVE TO FINISH THE GAME MULTIPLE ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES TO FIND MORE OF THE STORY. You might be thinking it's stupid to replay the same game, but trust me you critical piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ no two playthroughs are the same. In one playthrough, a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing fly might kill you. In another, you might take down mother♥♥♥♥ing SATAN.This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing crazy and fun that I think I just died. NOW STOP STALLING AND BUY IT YOU ♥♥♥♥ER			",79,10,1,14,5,3,4

The Binding of Isaac. A flash semi-bullet hell satirical game on Christianity.The story goes that you are a young child named Isaac whom is stripped of fun and enjoyment in simple life after Mother has heard the voice of God demand that all things sin is removed. Hearing His one last wish from the high heavens, Mother grabs a knife and traps Isaac in his room, his only escape being a trapdoor leading below the foundation of the house. One powerful bash through the door and down goes the poor child.The objective of the game is the clear any rooms you enter of monstrosities that lie in your way as you travel deeper and deeper in the depths of your own basement, or maybe a cellar; crawling around the caves and catacombs, throughout the Depths of Nercopolis; and facing the one they call... Mom! Along the way, you find pick-ups, items, tarot cards, and pills that could do good or could do harm to Isaac as you take him on a somewhat sad (but fun!) venture to escape.ReviewThe GoodThough I had originally thought this game was kinda sad, I eventually got it, played it, and actually found myself excited over playing it over and over, unlocking a variety of cool items and using sweet powers. Aside from Isaac, you can also play other characters that have different starter abilites (ex. Magdalene, Cain, Eve), each unlocking a new item with every successful playthrough. If you add in the Wrath of the Lamb DLC, there are also challenges that start you out with preset powers and curses--another method of unlocking fantastic pick-ups.The BadIt is possible that anything kinda bad in this game were cleared up in the ""sequel,"" Rebirth. (This portion of the review will be edited at a later time.)Concluding CommentsSeeing everyone (at one point) playing this game persuaded me to make an attempt to give it a go, and I do not at all regret making such a decision. The Binding of Isaac is an excellent action game that deserves the amount of support it has gotten. And Rebirth has done great justice. --Hermix.			",148,55,1,10,13,0,6

												I've never play ""The legend of Zelda"" games but I know that this game is based on it (and many other games). I must admit it's fun to play it and even better if you have the DLC. What's weird though is that I have religious feeling while playing it. It's plot is... I don't even have words to describe it. Anyway I recommend it to you guys because it has a nice gameplay.

												I know what you're thinking, ""What the hell is he saying?"" It's true that we've had so many biographies about presidents in which some of the movies told about historic incidents, why not have a fictional president that could kick♥♥♥♥♥and take names? Harrison Ford is the man for the job.""The Binding of Isaac"" is a thriller that involves Russian terrorist Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) and his gang of criminals hijacking the first plane along with the president's wife and child and his staff. Meanwhile, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is hiding after an attack on the ship where he must reunite with his family before they end up victims to Ivan's plan if the president doesn't release a Russian prisoner who happens to be a general and a terrorist.The film itself is a nail bitter thriller with an all star cast as Ford and Oldman play their usual good guy/villain roles with Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkerly and William H.

												The binding of Issac is one of those odd adventure games that combine a dark atmosphere with loads of combinations of items. a great side-scroller, and an investment in terms of its affordable price. I strongly recommend this game for its great ability to not become stale and provide hours of enjoyment in the vast quantities of enemies and items. A bit of dark humor also adds to the effect of this game to convey the message of a little boy trapped in a basement, on the run from his mother.			",21,3,0,4,1,0,2

												One of the first games i bought when I got my new PC, and it exceeded all expectations. It can be very challenging, but to me it has near infinite replayability.Most people compare it to any of the top down zelda games, but taking place 100% in the dungeons. What makes this better is the dark humor, the hundreds of items, the unlockable playable characters, and as i said before the replayabiltiy due to the randomly generated levels. Definitly worth $5, but its on sale for less than $2 a lot of the time and anyone would be stupid to pass it up at that price.			",1511,543,33,174,83,13,150

												Binding of Isaac is a great example of a well-executed indie title that marries interestingly odd and obscure art and story references with engaging twitch-reflex  gameplay. It's essentially a twin-stick shooter with power ups set in an unique dungeon environment. It has numerous rogue-like elements as well. It's lacking resolutions higher than 720P, and when in Windowed mode it plays in a 4:3 square that looks fairly small on a 1080 screen. While in fullscreen mode, you cannot access the Steam overlay. Other than few minor gripes listed above, this is a fun little rogue-like twin-stick-style adventure shooter set in a level-by-level dungeon design.			",182,31,2,66,10,0,5

												I'll be honest. When I first saw this game I thought that it was one of the most stupid things I had ever seen. The artstyle looked childish to me and I found that it didn't match the dark atmosphere of the rest of the game. The fact that the main character is constantly crying seemed absurd and the gameplay looked boring and unappealing.But daaaamn was I wrong.Once you get the hang of the game mechanics (which may take a few hours) you'll really get addicted to it. There is so much to find out, so many different enemies, so many secrets, so many items with so many different effects.Each run is truly unique and the combat has an unexpected depth to it so that you will get constantly better which is again very motivating and fun.The game is difficult (at the beginning at least) and it is a bit of luck involved but that just adds to the uniqueness of every run and makes it even more satisfying when you get good items and have good run.The soundtrack is also just glorious and fits the creepy atmosphere perfectly.And the artstyle...you'll learn to love it. It may look very peculiar at the beginning but with the sick character design and the soundtrack it creates a very morbid experience which pulls you in again and again.It's easily the best rogue-like game I've ever played and it may just be the best out there.If you are intrested I suggest just give it a try. It's cheap, so you can't go wrong. It really has a lot more to offer then it seems and chances are high that, despite the first impression, you will fall in love with it.			",85,44,0,19,9,0,7

												So basicly long story short here i'm playing COD:GHOSTS and my PC decides to get sum errors and it crashed so I call Geek Squad in to fix it and lo and behold it ends up taking about 11 hours to fix so i'm on my ipad thinking hey I could use a cool gamme to hold me over until I can beef up my KDR som e more so browsing the steam front page best sellers I see this gemOK actual review starts nowSo yeah obviously I was drawn to this game becuase judging by the graphix this game can DEF. run on lower end rigs/tablets which was perfect for me. Gameplay wise it's great you basicaly press 4-5 buttons at the monsters and theres blood and humour ha the maps could be better, def. expected more especially after playing a game like COD GHOSTS but they're ok for this indie bit. I hear there are people who play thsi game for like a lot of hours 60+ and are reely into it and its like lol go outside or just take a trip to gamestop XD Overall this game is a lot of fun so I give The Binding of Isaac a FIVEout of Five :)			",113,22,0,13,14,2,8

												I bought this game for 1$ and was quite amazed about how interesting it was. Basically, you play Isaac and have to defeat ennemies and bosses in various rooms. You kill ennemies by shooting them with your tears or by ""bombing"" them. This game is a ""rogue-like"" : you go through doors, not knowing what you'll get, and have to find the bosses in the various different floors, along with the ""item-rooms"" that level-up your tears or give you new abilities.The whole game is RNG, every floor is always randomly generated and this is the main point of the game : no playthrough will be identical, ever, and that's what offers a great replay value.Another important thing : permadeath. If you die in this game, you have to start back at the beginning  (with another layout of course, since everything is RNG), and trust me, you'll die often. But each time you die, you learn from your mistakes and make better the next time. At the beginning, you'll be happy if you reach level 5, but at the end, reaching level 8 is quite normal. (Note : if you unlock new item, death doesn't affect that)[Pros] : + RNG all around the place = infinite replay value+ 2 minutes to get the point of the game and the controlls, 200 hours to fully master it+ A ton of items and stuff, you will learn something new at each playthrough and get better and better+ Items have synergies and can be ""combined"" for powerful results+ Awesome price for awesome game (under 1$ in sale)+ Will train your reflexes, strategy and learning abilities + Cool graphic style+ You can make it work smoothly even on a potato computer+ Simple controls : WASD to move, Arrows to Shoot, E to Bomb, Space to Use Item, Q to use Pill/Card ; that's all.+ A ton of ""secrets"" to master to get better+ ""Humoristic"" items with Internet Memes References (Lemon, Hoop de Loop, Forever Alone, Super Meat Boy...)[Cons] : - Hard at the beginning, can be very frustrating if you don't like the ""learn by mistakes"" approach (=/= die and retry)- The game engine can lag sometimes, the game isn't fully oprimized- Don't hope beating the ""last"" boss with under 60 hours of /played (but the game is fun even if you never finish it)- RNG land, sometimes, you'll get f*** up hard by bad RNG[Conslusion] : Anyone that is ok with games that involve reflexes should try this, at least if it's in sale for less than 1 buck. 10/10 ",77,20,2,7,4,0,4

												note: I played this mostly offline, and have put considerably more than 4 hours into it.I know it's not a popular opinion, but I really don't like the Binding of Isaac. There are a lot of things to like about it, most notably the wonderfully grotesque design, but I personally hate the core mechanics. I really really tried to love it (largely because it was a game that was easy to play on the bus), but eventually gave up.Ok, so Binding of Isaac is a rogue-like, so we already know you're going to be dying and restarting a lot. That doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that you don't get better with each subsequent death. There's no lineage system or inventory hold over that helps you make a little more progress with each new game, you are just literally starting from scratch each time. And the controls are not complicated, so there isn't even an element of mastering the game's mechanics as progression.And then there's other major design decision that I hate, the complete randomness. Procedurally generated games can be a ton of fun and help to keep things interesting, but your success in each run of this game is largely decided before you even leave the first room. The enemies being random is great, it keeps things from being rote. However, the power-ups being random is a huge problem because of the disparity between them. Power-ups can be utterly worthless, or god-tier, and you never know what you're going to go get. But because your previous attempts don't have any impact, you're relying entirely on the much necessary power-ups, which are sometimes just going to be useless.One of my best runs was actually one of my first. In one of the first rooms I picked up a power-up that just devastated every enemy I came across. I've never been that lucky again. I enjoy challenging games, but there needs to be some sort of progression either through leveling or mastery of the mechanics, and Binding of Isaac has neither. There are of course going to be minor improvements to how you play, but for the most part, your 100th attempt has just as much chance of success as your 2nd attempt, and it's going to be based on what procedural roll you got. While this clearly doesn't deter most people, I find it to be an uninteresting set of mechanics that generally lead to wasting time on a run that was doomed to fail.			",316,129,2,17,24,5,33

												The Binding of Isaac is a micro dungeon crawler and expands itself the more runs you put into the game. It generates stages in a Zelda: Link to the Past sort of way, with a similair map style. I love the music in this game and the bosses are fun and grotesque. This game was pretty damn tough when I bought it, but it was worth it. It becomes easier and easier to get farther. Linux support would be nice, seeing there is already Mac support but there is no cause to complain. I can't wait for the remake!EDIT: There are saves for this game on YouTube, I lost my save due to lack of cloud support, added a save, got 9 achievements at once. It gave me the characters and such and saved about 40 hours of items I already had collected plus twenty more. In closing the worst fault of this game is easily fixed, if you haven't played it and use this technique I'd advise you not or you'll spoil the entire expierience. At 80 hours I barely have over half the achievements in this game, making it the most replayed game I own. Replay value seems nearly infinite.			",225,47,9,21,11,2,25

												This is a pretty great game. I've spent some time playing this again and there are some pretty gross parts to it but overall I found my experience enjoyable. I come from an age where games like this were best played with a controller. However after long hours of playing Realm of the Mad God playing this game seemed somehow easier with the mouse and keyboard.The best part about this game is its replayability. With random dungeons and different characters all of which play in a different way this game will give you a ton of enjoyment.			",212,46,3,36,11,1,24

												Note: Do NOT play this game if you're a full-on Catholic/Christian. You have been warned.Anyway, TBoI is a game in which you are a small child escaping your mom coz she wants to sacrifice you to prove she loves God above all else. So you jump into a basement (coz logic) and the adventure begins. The game's areas are set out as randomly generated dungeons, meaning you could have the best item stream ever, or get a really s*** one. That brings me to items; there is at least one item you can pick up per floor (well, two, since you get one from beating a boss) and they can range from upgrading your tears (your main ""weapon"" in the game) to making you Satan (literally).And finally, the bosses. Oh man, the bosses. I'll just say this (coz I can't explain anything). Watch out for Widow, The Wretched and your mom.			",28,0,0,0,1,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is a  Roguelike [en.wikipedia.org] Adventure game similar to the Legend of Zelda. Each run the player is confronted with a randomly generated arrangement of rooms containing a wide variety of enemies and traps. Each stage is completed by defeating a boss that has unique abilities. Throughout the run your character becomes stronger by acquiring upgrades. Once dead you have to start back at stage one meaning there is minimal progression outside of becoming more skilled and unlocking more items.The Binding of Isaac is an excellent example of a well executed modern Roguelike, although you may consider waiting for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth which will free the game from the limiting Flash engine which is one of Isaac's biggest flaws.

												Take a cross between the original Legend of Zelda's dungeons, bullet hell games like R-Type, and rogue-like games and you've got The Binding of Isaac. The game is simple yet very fluid. It's chock full of grotesque humor (one of the power ups is a Wire Coat Hanger) and disturbing imagery. The difficulty varies room to room and can be pretty brutal. There is no saving, so you only have one life (unless you find a 1-UP or other item). Each time you play the game everything - bosses, items, rooms, everything - is random. For a measly five bucks, six with the sound track, it's totally worth buying. Plus, hey, not only is it made by the creators of Super Meat Boy it also has one helluva awesome soundtrack, too.

												When I first saw this game it looked disgusting, but that was of course the main reason I got it. (I'm a sucker for wierd games)  Suprisingly I fell in love with it immedietley, it was very addictive & it also had a very nostalgic feel to it, reminds me of the good old days when you sat down for hours playing Pacman or Tetris or even that one game with the plumber in red. If you like any of those games even a little YOU need to play The Binding Of Isaac.			",199,37,7,18,17,1,19

												After playing this game for hours, I can honestly say this is in my top 5 games of all time. The gameplay is random, some rooms insanely easy (here kill a black fly) sometimes more difficult (like the bosses post floor 3). It is this sheer randomness and constant change in difficulty that makes it a game you will always want to play. Although the difficulty changes randomly, one bad move can mess up your game and it is this necessity to think before you act on a certain item that makes it great. My personal rating 9/10.

												The binding of Isaac does many things right when it comes to getting the player straight into the action. This action requires very precise and accurate reflexes to get into the end game. This is a very good game to exercise those reflexes and hone in quick decision making. This DOES require some outside research as to what certain upgrades do. Item choice matters greatly as some do more harm than good to your power. Overall, 9/10. The 1 dock being the amount of sheer repetition needed to unock later level tiers. I find it necessary for the game design and is implemented well, but just a tad bit too much for my taste.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I bought this game on 2012 Summer Sales, I thought it was just another indie game that would provide a limited amount of fun until its gameplay were squeezed out. A hundred hours later, I am still addicted to its gameplay. Every time you enter the game, it is different; the objects you find (passives, actives, trinkets, drops), the rooms, the enemies, the final bosses; they kill you after 50 minutes, you end up with nothing. But you press the play button again, you unlock a new item you have never seen, you kill everything with your insane ammount of damage, you feel powerful. And you die again.Plus, its religious/parodical theme makes it even more appealing if you are interested in these religious ormystical parafernalia. (Do not take me wrong, this game is in no way supporting nor insulting religion)The perfect combination of fun and frustration renders the game the perfect choice if you want something cheap, not demanding at all, and with a simple touch of fun.

												Although the game can be buggy at times, and there can be frame rate issues due to the fact it was made on flash, this is still a very fun and rewarding game to play. It is very challenging to start out, but as you unlock more items for later runs and learn the attack patterns of enemies and what items suit you, it becomes easier to progress farther each run. Even for experienced players, getting to the final boss and beating it on a run is a challenge, and the randomly generated floors add a lot of replay-ability. Excellent game from Team Meat.

												Punishing, disturbing, tight, and atmospheric; I *LOVE* The Binding of Isaac! A huge mix of items, each with their own unique and sometimes mysterious effects, excellent difficulty ramp, gut-wrenching enemies and environments, and little touches that makes each new game a brand-new adventure. The art-style is very simplistic, but effective in evoking the twisted and disgusting views of an abused child. If you like punishing, randomly generated, visceral games, there are few that do it as well as The Binding of Isaac.			",139,32,0,14,18,1,25

												Very addictive, with random levels and lots of itens. Always trying differents plans, and killing mom and get in the womb's. Beside that there is lots of achivements and secret characters to open.Recommended, if you like a dungeon crawler, it's the game for you.Jogo muito divertido e muito viciante, com muitos levels randomicos e muitos itens diferentes por jogo. Sempre precisando montar um plano baseado nos tipos de itens que aparecem para matar a mãe e ir para o ""Womb Level"". Além disso tem muitas conquistas e personagens secretos para abrir.Recomendo o jogo se vc gosta de um jogo tipo exploração de dungeon.			",76,18,2,5,9,1,19

												Quirky, addicting and fun, this game provides enough content for dozens of hours of play.However, there are many optimization issues as the game is made in flash (!). It might tear some nerves out of you, but it's not your fault. I can't wait for the new, updated version of this game that is supposed to run smoothly.			",49,28,0,8,3,2,22

												Okay, I guess since this is the most played game I have on my library, I've got some things to say about it. First of all, the game can be really hard on new players, but within a few hours you'll find yourself dwelling deeper into the depths of the basement (literally). The randomness of rooms, enemies and items you get each time really adds up for the replay, which is basically infinite. You feel challenged, sometimes a little unfairly, but most of the times, you're the only responsible for your success or defeat. It's very hard to put into words how much I enjoy playing this game. Each time you beat the game, it expands even more, and there's also challenges to complete, secrets to find, endings to discover, and to top all of that, a huge set of achievements to unlock, which will take your time very good. So, if you want a game that it's challenging, time-consuming and addictive, you can't go wrong for such a small price. And be sure to get the Wrath of the Lamb DLC as well.			",103,19,0,10,1,0,3

												The Binding of Isaac is a game where your mother is corrupted by sin and tries to kill you to please her ""lord"" and just before death you escape into a mysterious cave hidden under your rug. Within said cave you must acquire upgrades and kill ugly, vile, and probably smelly enemies such as flies, zombie headless things... And not to forget bosses. Some bosses include but are not limited to: Monstro, Larry Jr., Chub, and last but not least...*drum roll* Steven! As you make your way to the final floor you must kill your mother with all the items you've acquired. (By the way the whole game revolves around killing your mother for the most part.).Once your mother is dead you must delve into her ""womb"" and make your way to her heart. To wrap things up, this game is pretty Bad... BADASS! The game can provide you with endless hours of gameplay, so try it out, I mean really, it's only $5.			",40,5,0,4,2,0,3

There is so very much to do along with how it can be extremely challenging (or at least was for me) for a very long time. Plus, The Binding of Isaac is really not that expensive.

Thirdly, its fun as crap, I saw another review where this guy said it was like The Legend of Zelda on Crack, And I totally agree. This game is worth it, im already addicted. Get this Game!

												Great game, the story is ridiculous but it gives the game a certain dark and twisted feel which is great. The game has a steep learning curve and stays difficult, which I find great as mainstream games are getting easier by the day. Game is packed with hours of dungeon crawling, and will certainly keep you occupied for a long time. Best indie game of 2012 in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loads of fun, lotsa variety every time I pick up the game to play, and the more I played the more was unlocked, adding more to that variety. The levels are generated randomly each time so that adds to the fun and challenge of it, but I wish they also changed more randomly in terms of theme/screnery.All in all, you can't go wrong with this game, it'll pay for itself in spades.

												I was hesitant to buy the game at first because I had never played one of its type; however, I got it on sale and I would have payed full price. It is insanely addictive and presents and incredible challenge full of strange and horrifying monsters and items sprinkled with terribly dark humor. I will admit it may not be the best game for the faint heart or those who don't want to kill a fetus inside their mother's womb, but if that sounds like fun to you this is definitley the game for you. 10/10 would buy again.

												Okay, I guess since this is the most played game I have on my library, I've got some things to say about it. First of all, the game can be really hard on new players, but within a few hours you'll find yourself dwelling deeper into the depths of the basement (literally). The randomness of rooms, enemies and items you get each time really adds up for the replay, which is basically infinite. You feel challenged, sometimes a little unfairly, but most of the times, you're the only responsible for your success or defeat. It's very hard to put into words how much I enjoy playing this game. Each time you beat the game, it expands even more, and there's also challenges to complete, secrets to find, endings to discover, and to top all of that, a huge set of achievements to unlock, which will take your time very good. So, if you want a game that it's challenging, time-consuming and addictive, you can't go wrong for such a small price. And be sure to get the Wrath of the Lamb DLC as well.			",103,19,0,10,1,0,3

												I don't even know man... This game seems so very simple (and in a way, it can be), but it is very much in depth. I have spent countless hours playing it, yet I still get the urge to play more. There is so very much to do along with how it can be extremely challenging (or at least was for me) for a very long time. Plus, The Binding of Isaac is really not that expensive. For $5, i HIGHLY recommend this game. Heck, i would still recommend it for $20! 10 out of 10.AND THIS GAME IS JUST LIKE THE FIRST ZELDA!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although the game can be buggy at times, and there can be frame rate issues due to the fact it was made on flash, this is still a very fun and rewarding game to play. It is very challenging to start out, but as you unlock more items for later runs and learn the attack patterns of enemies and what items suit you, it becomes easier to progress farther each run. Even for experienced players, getting to the final boss and beating it on a run is a challenge, and the randomly generated floors add a lot of replay-ability. Excellent game from Team Meat.

To avoid his mother, Isaac goes into the basement to discover that his basement is full of man eating monsters! I would recommend this game because it is fun and kind of funny as well.

												The Binding of Isaac, and its DLC Wrath of the Lamb is an old school dungeon crawl, reminiscent of Legend of Zelda, and your worst nightmares and or mindscrews. I HIGHLY recommend it.to make it clear: this game takes the concept of grimdark and elopes with it. you might want a strong drink once you're done crying from its crippling difficulty, but just as with an abusive relationship, you can't help but come back to it for another helping. definitely a great game, with the simplicity you want in the controls, the difficulty you crave, unique graphics, and a soundtrack that will chill you right down your spine.have a listen here, this guy fell in love with the OST, while i go back to playing it.

The atmosphere, the items, the characters, and the huge variety of enemies and bosses are what makes this game so great, and it will have you playing it over and over again. If you're debating whether or not to buy the DLC, do it. It adds lots of more enemies and fun challenges that you will enjoy. I would give it a 9/10 due to the annoyingness of certain enemies.

The perma death features also scale well to both new and veteran players as it allows those who know the ropes to go insane with powerful items and those who don't to stil have great runs.

												Note: Do NOT play this game if you're a full-on Catholic/Christian. You have been warned.Anyway, TBoI is a game in which you are a small child escaping your mom coz she wants to sacrifice you to prove she loves God above all else. So you jump into a basement (coz logic) and the adventure begins. The game's areas are set out as randomly generated dungeons, meaning you could have the best item stream ever, or get a really s*** one. That brings me to items; there is at least one item you can pick up per floor (well, two, since you get one from beating a boss) and they can range from upgrading your tears (your main ""weapon"" in the game) to making you Satan (literally).And finally, the bosses. Oh man, the bosses. I'll just say this (coz I can't explain anything). Watch out for Widow, The Wretched and your mom.			",28,0,0,0,1,0,0

												This game is fantastic!! It is so creepy and the story is so odd that it makes it a great game. The way you get upgrades in the game is awesome and the fact that they are always random makes it even better. The game does start off easier and progresses on different levels and gets harder like any other game. The further you get into the levels you will come across new creatures and it gets darker and darker. Isacc is not the only character you can play as, there are a few other characters that have different items to start off as and you unlock them as you get certain things in the game. I think that everyone should purchase this game. Even if you beat the game really quickly you can replay it a ton of times because you can always get a different character setup because of the randomly placed items.			",58,9,1,8,14,0,7

												The Binding of Isaac is another one of those bizarre though strangely satisfying indie games. The gameplay seems to mimic some of the old Legend of Zelda games. The Game's story is a strange one. Basically you play as Isaac whose, a child of unknown age. He's running away from his mother, who was ordered by God to sacrifice him. You fight various monsters, including some random fights with the 7 deadly sins. I also feel like this game ambitioned to be the most anti-christian game ever. There's multiple jokes about huge Chrisian no-nos.This game is outragious, difficult, and totally discusting...But that's what makes me keep coming back for more.			",124,83,0,17,26,1,11

												The Binding of Isaac, very good game, with an aspect of rogue-like, without a doubt, who hesitate to spend money on this very good game like I said, not regret, because as more and more go playing, unlock achievements objects that change the appearance and powers of Isaac, or have played well enough to unlock the other characters. Spend hours trying to get more than the last time, that's how addictive, next to unlock things.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is a great game! It has simple controls, great replay-ability, cool graphics, lots of comedic elements, and what seems like an infinity of items. There are references and jokes about Catholic religion, but rest assured that they are not critical to the game. No need for conversion ;) I recomend this game to anyone, as long as they are 10+ years old. BUY IT!!! It's worth $10-15 at least.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game will have you screaming at your screen in frustration... and then coming back for more.The replay value on this game is incredible. The content just doesn't end! (well, it does, but you get the point)Overall, get this game. It's a great deal for its price. While your at it, get the dlc too, it also great and adds even more content.			",76,16,1,10,3,0,0

												Caution: This game is really hard! The game has an expansion pack called ""Wrath of the Lamb"" wich I higly sugest getting. It is also the version I'm going to talk about.(If you're reading this after 4/11 you should go get rebirth instead)To beat the entire game, you have to get the ""Platinum God"" achievement. To get get this, you must unlock everything and complete the game 200 times. Yes. 200 times. Beating the game takes around 45 minutes so you can calculate for yourself how much you have to play to win.  I've played this game a lot, and I'm nearing completion. But let me tell you. When you finally get that Platinum God in your achievemnt showcase on your profile it will be amazing. Except that noone knows how hard it is so they won't be impressed.9/10 Has some minor flaws that can easily be forgotten when playing this endurance test of a game.Conclusion: Rub money on your screen untill it accepts your purchase.

												The Binding of Isaac is an amazing 2D roguelike game. It combines brutal difficulty, random dungeons, hundreds of items, and that classic Legend of Zelda feel into one really awesome and challenging game. It will take some getting used too, but once you have got the basics down, you'll have tonnes of fun playing this game.If you are good at running and gunning, you'll love this game... Now, just combine fast paced gaming, brutal enemies, hundreds of item combinations, random dungeon structures, and a wide variety of bosses, and you've pretty much summed up this epic game.8.5 out of 10.

If you are a fan of Super Meat Boy, and want to play a game drawn by them but similar to the play style of Zelda a link to the past, then this is the game for you!  Two thumbs up if I do say so myself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolutely amazing and extremely addictive roguelike that will leave you wanting more and more and more. At least 100 hours in and I can never get enough this is by far one of the best values you can get for your money on this site.-GraphicsNothing mind blowing to see here, keep in mind this is an indie title, but the visuals are very sharp and crisp and the hand drawn style is something I think everyone could appreciate. Ed Mcmillen brings his dark imagination alive with cute enemy design with dark tones in a vivid and smooth way. 9/10-SoundAnother excellent aspect of this game, Danny Baranowsky graces this game with an intoxicating score that never gets old and is always welcomed. The sound effects also nail it with gross tones and excellent notes that bring more life into the game. 10/10-ControlsOne of the few areas I believed needed work. A game that is a pain to play with mouse and keyboard, but feels amazing with controller, just needs mapping attention. I feel like this game deserved some native controller support. Once you get the controller mapped and configured however, it feels like a dream, I highly recommend using an Xbox controller when mapping. 7/10-GameplayA randomly generated dungeon crawler, you'll complete a set number of levels and floors all ending with a boss fight. The level structure for this game as well as item placement and boss encounters are all random, which the only strategy for this game has to come from experience which is completely amazing. You clear rooms, discover treasure, acquire upgrades, fight bosses in the end. Will you make it? Will you get all the way to the end and choke? That's up to you. This is definitely the shining tower in this title which is most important in any game. 10/10-Replayability I believe I already used the term ""Random"" so I really cant stress enough just how impressive and addictive this title is. Everything about this game is random, item placement, loadout possibility, the structure and all is a random dip. 11/10Overall while no game is perfect, this game comes pretty damn close. 9/10. Buy it if you don't have it, there are no regrets here.			",690,147,10,105,40,3,53

												For a game with such a simple premise, it provides nice complexity and challenge. Plays much like classic isometic dungeon crawlers and rogue-likes.

												Isaac possesses charm wrapped in a very twisted story. Originally I thought it was a very primitive top view shooter, but after spending more time with it and understanding some simple tricks, I found it's actually quite complex offering a mild strategy that can be frustratingly addictive. Permadeath really adds an element of player alertness making you try harder not to take damage.Although the game is extremely short, there is a surprising amount of replay value due to its randomly generated maps, monster combinations, and item drops. You really never know how you are going to fair on any given playthrough which keeps it from feeling repetitive. With practice and persistence, you will unlock new items that make the game somewhat easier, but also more fun. Experimenting with item combinations is a treat, plus it's hard not to break a smile from some of the crazy power ups as well.For a $1 game, Isaac holds priceless value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is one of my favorite games that I never expected to like at all.  With its brown and gray levels, pictures of a lo-fi crying naked kid on the splash screen, I wasn't sure what to think at first.  When I first bought the game during a sale, I played it a few times, died, and shut down the game.  I didn't get it at all.  Then, a few months later, I tried again.  I found a better way to use the controls (I used a mouse and keyboard, instead of just the keyboard) and I picked up the item My Little Unicorn.  I was hooked.  I died milions of times.  I wanted to see what other messed up items the game held - Mom's bra?  Demon lasers?  The best part was that the items changed the appearance of your character.  Every playthrough was different.  I unlocked other characters.  I struggled to fight Mom.  When I finally defeated Mom I cheered aloud.  I hadn't felt such exuberance over a boss fight since early raiding in World of Warcraft.Who shouldn't play this game?  Christian literalists with no sense of humor... otherwise, I highly recommend it to anyone else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You'll find a bunch of pills and decide to try them...and you'll die.  After too many attempts to count, you'll finally make it to the end...and die.  You'll make it to the end again...and die again.  Eventually, you'll make it to the end...and...wait...was that the end?  No, it actually wasn't the end.

												The Binding of Isaac has all you expect from a rogue-like: permadeath, randomized levels and items, tons of secrets and achievements to discover, unlockables...What did it for me is the ambiance. The story is minimal but still original, and is served well by a gorgeous soundtrack, simple yet nice looking graphics, and surprises like the arcade, the secret rooms, and so on.A downside of the game, for me, is the utter randomness of it. Sometimes you'll get lucky and have a super build, sometimes you'll just get crappy items over crappy items. I should warn you about it's difficulty, too. Some rooms are very hard and you need extra quick reaction time not to get hurt, and this is where Flash was a bad choice, making the game laggy when too many elements are on screen.Overall, it's still an awesome game that I recommended to lots of my friends, and some of them are even more hooked than me.

												An amazingly well executed twin-stick shooter. The powerups visually change your character, so it's very cool to watch your monsterification as you play through. Tough and unforgiving at times, there's a real sense of accomplishment when you get through the harder rooms and bosses, especially later on. Contains disturbing imagery and themes, so not for the squeamish or easily offended.			",116,81,2,20,9,0,26

												I had a really fun time playing this game and still do. Graphics: GreatSound: AmazingControls: W,A,S,D,E,Q,Shift,Spacebar, and MouseGameplay: Shoot tears to defeat enemies and progress to the boss and onto the next level.Story: Great. You vs. every kind of enemy imaginable and a healthy does of BS once every game.What the sequel did was give the game more items, bosses, upped graphics, added more achevements, and gave it more enemies which means more BS. :) All for 10 more dollars. 9/10 A really great indie game but can be a little disturbing at times.

												They need to add difficulties or something, I'm not someone who plays a game for two seconds then gives up because it's ""too hard', but this is ridiculous. Also, I just can't take how everything is randomized, down to the enemies you meet. If you like the game, you can get the DLC which for some reason makes the game even more difficult! (Check the BoI wiki, it states the DLC is more difficult than the normal game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Isaac comes to in the upper level of the basement and you, the player, must guide him through the dangers that lurk below. The UI is very similar to what you’d expect from an early Zelda title. You have three heart containers. Three counters keep track of your amount of coins, bombs, and keys. The dungeon layout is shown on the upper left and your current items are listed next to your heart containers. You start out with only your tears to fight off the grotesque creatures of the basement. Each floor of the basement is littered with a slew of enemies, chests, items, a treasure room, and a boss room. Upon entering a room, all of the doors will lock until every enemy in it has been defeated. You can blow open a door, but it will cost a single bomb. Useable items can often be found in chests, but are also dropped from enemies. These could be tarot cards, pills, or some other miscellaneous item. Where as the tarot cards have a specific use, pills have random uses. These range from incredibly useful to potentially harmful, so consume them at your own risk. Treasure rooms are marked by their gold outlines, and within them lies a single power-up. These power-ups can increase your speed, change your projectile type, increase your max HP, etc. Some power-ups are weak and their effects can leave more to be desired, while others can be complete game changers and turn the tide of battles in your favor. They’re creatively designed and include some pretty outlandish things like a pair of high heels and even dog food. They also change your physical appearance, and seeing as they stack infinitely, this can result in some pretty hilarious or gruesome appearances. As you progress throughout the game, Isaac’s exterior begins to reflect the hell that is the basement. There are a plethora of bosses and they all battle in different ways. Defeating a boss will open a trapdoor to the next level, and between each floor of the basement a cutscene plays that shows Isaac having a nightmare, often of him being publicly embarrassed. The cutscenes, although oddly humorous, add little depth to Isaac’s character as it can be assumed that the events he worries over never actually took place, seeing as some are pretty over-the-top, such as one where he dreams he was being pooped on by a group of people. The final boss is no other than Isaac’s mother. And even after you’ve managed to beat her, your adventure still isn’t over. There still remains another set of levels and a whole mess of enemies, secrets, items, and power-ups to find.Through and through, The Binding of Isaac is a bonafide roguelike in every sense of the term. Every dungeon is randomly generated, resulting in no two runs feeling exactly the same. You’re given simple controls and absolutely no tutorial of any sort. Like any self-respecting roguelike, this is a game of trial and error, and it isn’t afraid to hand you your behind on a silver platter. The staggering amount of enemies will force you to adapt to any situation, and you’ll find yourself dying often before you’ve learned most of the enemies’ maneuvers. Bosses deal a lot of damage fast and some will even spawn smaller enemies around themselves. Even after you’ve learned the behavior of every enemy in the game, you’ll still find yourself dying quite often. Useable items and power-ups add variation to the gameplay and the tactics you’ll use in combat. With the unbelievable amount of depth found in the seemingly simple game, The Binding of Isaac produces an experience that becomes insanely addictive and rarely feels stale, even after dozens of hours of playtime.The Binding of Isaac’s visual presentation is something straight from the mind of a madman. Its art style is sleek, simple, and endearing. The various brown hues of the basement stand apart from each other, enhanced by the excellent shading, but they’re just pieces in a whole that create an immersive and beautiful environment. The story is primarily told through Isaac’s drawings. It’s all nice and cutesy, that is until you actually walk around and see the dreadful conditions of the basement. A myriad of deformed and bloody enemies stalk the rooms and each seem to spout blood like a fountain upon dying. There are these worm-like enemies that actually look somewhat adorable, until they charge at you with their fangs bared, trying to eat your face off. Piles of poop lay scattered on the ground. The changes that accompany the power-ups can be humorous, but others completely change the way Isaac looks, essentially turning him into one of the monsters that he faces. The fact that you aren’t alone suggests that you aren’t the first to face the wickedness of Isaac’s mother, and the possibility that the enemies could be related to him makes the adventure even more cringe worthy. In some dungeons you’ll find a room in which you can purchase items in exchange for coins. Each of these shops feature a hanging Isaac-lookalike, their faces twisted with expressions of despair. It’s an enthralling visual endeavor that shocks you from the start and carries out its dark themes with precise execution.The Binding of Isaac’s soundtrack aims to emphasize the same contrast brought about by the art style, and it manages to do so quite well. The music is slightly upbeat and detracts from the hopelessness that Isaac feels as he wanders through the basement. At times the music speeds up just a bit and the volume increases, ramping up your adrenaline at the same time. There is a slight feeling of loneliness in the unknown created by the soundtrack, and this is where it slightly fractures the contrast and actually melds with the setting. Enemy and projectile sounds are squishy in nature, but impactful overall. The contrast between the game’s dark themes and relatively uplifting music is genuinely interesting and adds another layer of depth.Despite its numerous references and tie-ins to other forms of media, The Binding of Isaac does plenty to set itself apart from the pack. There are some really laughable moments in the otherwise grim depths of the basement: there’s a certain enemy that will scurry away from you, whimpering as it tries desperately to flee; of the hanging Isaac-lookalikes in the shops, one of them has a huge grin on his face; some of the items and power-ups are just meant to make you burst out laughing, like Mom’s Pad – a useable item that makes all enemies in a room retreat for several seconds. Also, it raises some very serious questions that most games wouldn’t dare ask. It ventures into often-untraveled territory by challenging our understanding of organized religion, mental illness, and child abuse. These are very touchy subjects and it’s admirable to see developers who aren’t afraid to speak on them. The Binding of Isaac proves to be a unique and addictive adventure. Its humor is welcoming and its roguelike nature results in an unbelievable amount of replay value. While it may look simple at first, there is a surprising amount of depth to be found. Its endearing art style and aesthetically pleasing soundtrack is welcoming, while its dark themes are perfectly executed in the story and character designs. More than just a fun game, it questions what we as a society perceive to be norms and challenges us to think differently. The only real downsides to the game are the lack of characterization on Isaac and the slight capitalization on nostalgia. Aside from that, it’s an incredible game that should be played by anyone who enjoys a solid roguelike – or just a good game in general – because it stands head and shoulders above its competition in the genre.

												The Binding of Isaac is just an endlessly replayable fun. 10/10 for me.Wrath of the Lamb DLC adds many new elements to the gameplay making the game more difficult. What can I say, it's my favourite game on Steam, buy it! :PEDIT: and now we have year 2015 and thanks to one of developers (Florian Himsl) this game gets yet another awesome (free) DLC - Eternal Edition which brings hard mode and couple of fixes. New enemies attack patterns, more bullethelly gameplay and 15 new achievements to get! A must-play for every hardcore Isaac fan!This is the ultimate edition of the game, I doubt if anybody could squeeze anything more from this flash version of the game. And one last thing: hard mode is optional. If you're one of those people who completely reverses his rating because of this update - you're out of your mind :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much like Edmund McMillan's last game, Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac is a game which can reach brutal difficulty, boasting dark, violent humor and unique visuals. Where Super Meat Boy was a platformer, Binding of Isaac is a roguelike RPG of sorts; a game where death is imminent and repeat playthroughs are not suggested, they are required. The levels, enemies, bosses, and treasure are randomized allowing for amazing changes in gameplay every run. I give this game my highest recommendation, but beware that it may not be for all tastes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac appears to be a very addictive game. You start out with only a few rooms to go through to kill Mom, but after that, the game expands more, so you have to play through it longer. I certainly died a lot of times before defeating Mom, and later her heart. The way that each time you play generates a different map set-up helps in making the game very addictive. If you play this game, get ready to become very involved in it. Overall, I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy addictive gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great game!I bought this game in the Steam Winter Sale, when it was available for 0,66€ including the DLC. I saw some gameplay-videos before, but never found it particularly interesting. However, that changed a few weeks ago when a friend of mine told me that it was quite fun. So I decided to give it a try for a that cheap price. What shall I say...? I have never been that addicted to a game in such a short time! It's an indie masterpiece.The Characters:You are playing as one out of seven characters. By default, only Isaac is unlocked, for the others you have to achieve certain victories or find certain items in order to unlock them. Each character has it's own pros and cons, so it's pretty much up to the player which one to play.The Story:Actually, there's not much story in the game. To sum it up, it'd be as follows (no spoilers, d'oh!): Isaacs' mum which is a strong believer in some kind of god, wants to kill you, because her ""god"" told her to do so. It is up to you to get stronger by finding items and unlocking more and powerful abilities (which come with items) to finally kill your mum. Voilà.The Gameplay:Basically, in The Binding of Isaac you run through small areas (called rooms). There are 6 levels until you get to the bossfight. Each level contains of around 5 to 15 areas. But don't let these small numbers fool you! The game is insanely challening, I'm hardly able to reach level 4 by now, and if I do, I was insanely lucky with the items. Speaking of items, they upgrade your basic stats or change something about your abilities. For example, you might get +1 attack, get faster, get a buddy who shoots enemies whenever you shoot, or get a stronger attack.There's a main attack (your tears) and a secondary attack, which is fired when pressing spacebar. The main attack can be upgraded by finding items, however, in order to get a secondary attack, you will only have one when you find a secondary-attack item.Except when using certain items you have one live only. When you die, you have to start at zero again, no items, no buffs, nothing. However, your HP can be upgraded or degraded, but it still required skill to beat the game.Information about the graphics and certain gameplay elements:Most of the items you'll find will mutilate your character. This sometimes looks quite gross, especially if you consider the young age of the main protagonist, Isaac. So if you're a squeamish person, you might want to take this into account. However, the graphics are in no way hyperrealistic, which minimalizes this problem I guess.Summary:If I had to use points in order to show, how good or bad the game is, here is what it'd look like:Graphics: 6/10 (awesome animations, everything looks sweet, but it's quite repetitive)Gameplay: 10/10 (insanely nice working, hard but fair)Story: WHO CARES?Addiction-level: 8/10 (I don't know yet how long this game will entertain me, but at the moment it's freaking addictive)Fun-level: 10/10 (this is very personal, ofc.)PS: There's sometimes a problem with the achievements, meaning you can't unlock them. Then you have to follow some guides in order to be able to unlock them. If you're an achievement-hunter, this might be interesting for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A twinstick shooter/roguelike hybrid, The Binding Of Isaac combines a tough but mostly fair difficulty with near-infinite replay value. Each playthrough lasts only an hour or two (assuming you don't die early on), but the procedurally generated levels, enemies, and item spawns make each one unique. The sheer amount of content is also impressive: I've sunk over 115 hours into the game as of this writing, and there's still a good bit more I haven't unlocked or discovered yet.TBOI has an old school mindset to it, in that there are tons of different enemies and powerups, but the game does not spell out for you the best way to take on the enemies or make use of the powers, or sometimes even what the powers do. This might sound off-putting, but I find it provides for a highly satisfying sensation of skill progression as you work these things out for yourself. Over time, you will even begin making tactical decisions about when to skip a powerup that doesn't work well with your current build.The Wrath Of The Lamb DLC is also heartily recommended, which provides a huge increase to the number of powerups in the game, a new character to unlock, and an entirely new class of pickup, all of which make for even more build possibilities; special challenges that unlock new powerups upon completion; a plethora of new enemies, bosses, and level permutations; and even a brand new level at the endgame.In the interest of full disclosure, the game does have a number of bugs and glitches, including a rather annoying bug regarding unlocks that can result in 4 specific ones being removed from your save history, making you have to unlock them all over again. Very few of these bugs are gamebreaking though, and the few that do cause you to have to cancel your current playthrough are extremely rare (I've never encountered one in all my playtime). Reading the wiki page on bugs, and keeping a spare copy of your most recent so.sol file (which records your unlocks and settings), will help you avoid nearly all of them, and those that can't be avoided tend to be completely trivial at worst, so I would strongly advise you to not let these few minor annoyances dissuade you from picking up one of the best values for the money you can possibly find on Steam.

												The Binding of Isaac is a retro style rogue like game. At first it might not look that impressive, but let me tell you, this game is quite addictive. It's unforgiving when it comes to difficulty, mostly because, just like any roguelike, death is permanent, and each time you start a new game, the map, the enmies, the bosses, the items, and other stuff are randomly generated.That means, sometimes you'll have excellent runs, where the game loves you, gives you the best items (There are TONS to collect), and isn't that merciless with it's enemy placement. But sometimes, it's quite the opposite. The game HATES you, and will do anything to ♥♥♥♥ you up before you reach the end. Few health pickups, tons of hard enemies in cramped rooms, no good items, so on, so on :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You wont regret getting this game, I can guarantee it.. Different runs everytime, it could be frustrating at first but you'll enjoy more and more as you dig into the game.. Game is funny, has a great art style and actually a great story (you may not get the story by yourself but you can look it up in the internet).. The game is enough on its own but with the dlc you'll get like 100 more items which doubles the fun but as i said game is enough on its own.. And I'll give it a 10/10.Now we only need to wait for the Rebirth.. ",62,10,0,11,1,0,1

												The Binding of Issac is a fun dungeon crawler that brings the rogue-like genre back to it's roots. The Binding of Issac understands how pacing works and that players need to spend most of the game gearing up for the final boss battle. It mixes a memerable soundtrack with an intriguing art style to create a difficult yet nostalgic game that will keep you playing for hours. While I am on the subject of The Binding of Issac, the DLC, Wrath of The Lamb, adds TONS more content for the mere price of £1.99. This is how I believe expansion packs should be handled rather than the current expectation of ""a couple more skins"". I would reccomend this game to gamers who enjoy dungeon crawlers, intense soundtracks and a beautiful aethstetics style.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic!! It is so creepy and the story is so odd that it makes it a great game. The way you get upgrades in the game is awesome and the fact that they are always random makes it even better. The game does start off easier and progresses on different levels and gets harder like any other game. The further you get into the levels you will come across new creatures and it gets darker and darker. Isacc is not the only character you can play as, there are a few other characters that have different items to start off as and you unlock them as you get certain things in the game. I think that everyone should purchase this game. Even if you beat the game really quickly you can replay it a ton of times because you can always get a different character setup because of the randomly placed items.			",58,9,1,8,14,0,7

												This is my first review so feedback on how I did would be appreciated. This was one of the first games I got on steam. Some friends told me that it was not worth its full price and I should just wait for the discount but I didnt listen to them. This game is completely worth its price. Its only five dollars without the DLC and eight dollars with the DLC making it extremely cheap. This game requires very little power so I could play it on my terrible laptop. When I first started playing this game I was so bad at it and I wondered how anyone could ever beat it. But if you play this game for the first few rounds you will start to want to play more and more and beat what you got last game. The first ten times you beat the game, even if its with the same character, you get something new. Then you can beat it with all the other characters. Every character has their good parts and bad parts. Character choice is also a crucial decision even in the late game making you really have to figure out who you like to pay as. Some poeple say that this game is very small and that is true but you have to remember that this actually started out as a flash game. ocne youve beat the game a lot it starts to feel a bit repetative but to give you an example of what I mean by a lot, I have played over 200 hours of this game and only in the past 2 hours or so did I start to feel it getting boring. But that means that I got about 25 hours of gameplay for every dollar I spent. This is a great game if you like roguelike games. Every run is either a bit or completely different from the others depending on what items you choose to pick up. This isnt a multiplayer game but its fun to play around friends to see peoples different strategys. I really enjoyed this game and all my friends hate me because I played to much of it. 9.5/10Stats:Money: 10/10 (Really cheap game)Controls: 10/10 (They work and they're easy to learn)Sound: 8/10 (The soundtrack is ok, I dont normally play with volume on)Replayability 10/10 (200 hours, each run is about a half an hour need I say more?)

												This awesomely fun game is everything a roguelike should be:  quick and dirty, with lots of gross monsters and more items that help than hinder.  These items, by the way, often change up the gameplay in dramatic and surprising ways (example: you start off shooting teardrops at enemies, but you might suddenly find a devil head that lets you barf huge streams of blood across the screen).  It's like a cutely sacrilegious Zelda (NES) meets Robotron: The Cardinal Direction-only Edition.  Only negative that I have is that the game runs in Flash, and you have to run JoytoKey or some such to be able to use your gamepad.  And believe you me, the gamepad is a must.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A rather fun game.  A single run of the game is short, but it works since there is no save function.  The rogue-like elements make the game very enjoyable, as each dungeon level is completely different between game sessions.  It takes a little getting used to, and you must expect to have to restart a few times before finally completing it, but the randomness and difficulty, which is challenging but not overly difficult, make the game very enjoyable.

												Roguelike meets bullet hell. Another instant classic from Edmund McMillen. That name alone should make you buy it, but the game is so awesome in all departments: gameplay, replayability, nightmarish yet funny design, insane number of items which affect your character. I love it. You will love it. Don't forget to get the single DLC for more bizzare items and monsters.The only sad thing is that your PC should be decent enough to run it, though you wouldn't think that if you judge by the screenshots. This is because the game is made with Flash and is huge, so I can't play it comfortably (too much lag) on my cheap laptop I take with me when travelling.

Binding of Isaac gives the experience of dugeon crawling from early Legend of Zelda games, with procedural generated content being a major factor. Rooms, enmies, bosses, and items are all randomly generated for every play through, which makes for incredibly unique experiences every time you play. The glaring issues with this title seem to all be represented on the technical side of things: deleting temporary browser data /still/ wipes part of your save file,  no steam cloud support, limited control configuration (no gamepad support). Gribes aside, Binding of Isaac offers hours of arcade-like entertainment with high replay value, all for a mere $5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well after giving this game a little more time I realized the reason I hated it was becasue I didnt understand the fun factor of this game. =P Now that I do I have this to say.This game is awsome if you have the patieence to continue doing runs over and over again. The thing that makes it fun to keep doing the runs tho is the fact that if you can even get ONE new item you feel that the run was worth it.			",206,28,1,37,44,0,58

												Just about everything about this game was done with polish, and then some. It's mindless, yet, if you care to explore the story itself, the game gets really deep, really dark, and really fast. Just about every item in the game has some kind of allusion, all the monsters were EXTREMELY well thought out in their design (and more importantly their naming), and the music is the typical Indie dreamboat soundtrack that Edmund McMillen whips up every now-and-again.For the most part, even if you could care less about the story, music, or art, the game is downright FUN. It's (obviously) punishing, since it's a rogue-like, ridiculously simple to pick up but hard to master, and no two runs are the same. If you really want something that's BAD about this game, the only thing that really comes to mind is the lack of co-op, local or otherwise (solved in Rebirth), and item balance (for the most part, one of the first things you'll hear about this game is just how ridiculously broken Ipecac or Mom's Knife can be).One of the very few games that I can say should be priced HIGHER, can only see that it's dropped in price probably because of how spoiled the community is with sales. Back when it was $10, it often went on sale for a whopping $2USD WITH DLC. I won't lie, I bought it at that price tag. Had I known how damn awesome this game would be, I'd have honestly bought it full-price.Please do yourself a favor and get the DLC, it practically doubles the content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Binding of Isaac is great fun. It combines Zelda dungeons with roguelikes with several other different types of gameplay elements in order to create a very unique game. Every floor is generated completely randomly, which makes every playthrough a unique one. As you play through the game more and more, more and more previously off-limits content becomes available to you. There also is an expansion pack available, Wrath of the Lamb, which makes the game a LOT harder but adds a ton of new content and makes the game even more fun. I suggest getting it after beating the full game a few times. The game does have one pretty big downside, though. It's a Flash game, which occasionally causes poor performance, which can screw you up. However, the game is being remade in its own engine, under the title of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. Rebirth will have all the content from before and all of the Wrath of the Lamb content, along with even more stuff. It should be out some time this year.tl;drPROS:*extremely high replay value*tons and tons of unlockable content*tons and tons of readily available content*lots of secrets to discover*a remake is being released this year that will be even better than originalCONS:*fairly high difficulty*occasional poor performance due to flash engine ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Small dungeon crawler with roguelike elements. You play as a small child Isaac in nightmarish semi-random basement levels fighting some really disturbing monsters. You can develop Isaac's speed, health and damage by finding various power-ups (there is A LOT of these).Beware, the game is difficult, but very addictive. A full playthrough takes about 30-45 minutes, but usually you get killed before you reach the final level. It took me almost 10 hours to complete the game for the first time.Side note: game features child abuse and a lot of disturbing gore/violence including blood, intestines, urine, feces.But to sum up, it's really worth playing (especially at sale prices below $0.99). It's addictive, has a spooky atmosphere and completing the game is rewarding.GRAPHICS: 8/10AUDIO: 8/10GAMEPLAY: 7/10STORY: 8/10			",157,83,9,22,24,1,41

												Man, this game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's $5, and often goes on sale for about a dollar. Lots of items, bosses, room layouts, and a super awesome DLC that adds a ton to the game. The game only gets more challenging and complex as you unlock new items, characters, secrets, and challenges. Also all of the achievements are great, and most unlock a new item or playable character. Easily one of the best price-to-playing-time ratios on steam hands down. I have gotten over 100 hours out of this game, and I'm not even bored. I've gotten over 100 hours out of this game, and it costs less than a combo meal at the drive-through. Pick it up on sale and you will not be dissapointed.

												Meet Isaac, a child raised by his mother.  One day she is told by God that her son has become corrupted and must be relieved of his earthly possessions.  God then tells her to she needs to kill her son, which Isaac doesn't think is a very good idea.  He then plunges himself down a trapdoor to escape his mothers lust to please her God.This Zelda-like dungeon crawler has virtually endless replayability.  Each time you begin, the game randomly generates floors for you to fight through to get to your mom, the main antagonist.  The variety continues as you unlock other characters to start out as, each having his/her own special attributes.  The Wrath of the Lamb DLC adds many new bosses and items.Gameplay on keyboard uses the wasd keys for movement and arrow keys for directional shooting by default.  On controller, it acts much the same, utilizing both analog sticks.  This game was made in flash and isn't very well optimized.  It lags often (and occasionally crashes), mostly dependent on how crazy the items you picked up are, which brings me to the item combinations.  There are many items in The Binding of Isaac that synergize with each other, adding to the uniqueness of each run.  There are also many unlockable playable characters.The game is played from a top-down perspective.  The floor is separated by rooms that are all the same size, but there is a ton of variety between them.  The aforementioned Wrath of the Lamb DLC adds many more rooms to discover and explore.  The sound effects in The Binding of Isaac would be unsettling for any new player, but it grows on you the more you play.  The soundtrack was constructed by Danny Baranowsky, who's work is also in Crypt of the NecroDancer.Although it has its flaws, it's an amazing roguelike  I'd recommend The Binding of Isaac to anyone looking to get the most out of their money.  Isaac has given me over 500 hours of gameplay, and I'll still feel like knocking out a run from time to time.  With the amount of characters, items, and rooms it's possible to encounter, no two runs through this game will ever be the same.Pros:*Great soundtrack*Many different enemies*Replayability*No two games are ever the sameCons:*Poorly optimized*Lags often*Crashes on occasion7/10			",397,121,18,41,42,7,34

												Been playing this game...well ALOT. The Binding of Isaac has great soundtrack, and the art style adds a beautiful feel to the game. With easy to learn controls for movement and attacking enemies it allows people to gain knowlege of the enemies that come to attack them, instead of spending hours remembering the keys. The creatures and dark humor of the game is insanly interesting and can be funny when items which are ment to copy horrible things in real life become quite useful. The games way of randomizing everything allows for re-playablility even if a person has gotten ""Golden god"" or 100% the game. Had many many hours of fun with this game and will continue to do so, and I would recommend this game to anyone.			",47,13,0,5,11,1,3

												The Binding of Isaac is an amazing game that mixes elements from The Legend of Zelda dungeon crawling all the way to games like Minecraft with it's randomization. In the Binding of Isaac, you play as a small boy called, Issac who is chased down into the basement of his house due to his Mother believing that she is hearing the voice of God.      You can collect many different types of Weapons in the Binding of Isaac. Ranging from arrows, to bombs, to stranger things such as ipecac, to brimstone, to chocolate milk! There more items than just weapons. You can collect things that will aid you on your journey such as dog food (Additional health), and Pyro (You grow fuses in your head that give you 99 bombs). There is a great diversity of items in the game and it is very unlikely that you will get the same items in next playthroughs.     Now, all of these items don't mean much if the combat is bad. And it is not. Rooms are randomly generated and there is quite a selection of enemies to fight. All the enemies in the game serve a specific role to play. There are not many different types of bosses however in the game, which does mean that you repeat a boss that you fought in a previous run.     All in all, the binding of isaac is a great dungeon crawling game and plenty of randomization to make each run different.			",174,14,2,12,12,0,10

												Very fun top down action rpg shooter kind of game, with the only progression being the playable characters you unlock and possible power ups you can find.The game itself reminds me a lot of the original Legend of Zelda in the way its set up; the way you traverse the levels and find different power ups and pickups.It's made to be highly replayable, with no two runs being alike in the way of found power ups and enemy/room layout.It's a difficult game for most at first, dying is frequent and can turn a whole lot of effort into a whole lot of sadness.It's only $5 and it's a great deal of fun; if you're a fan of retro action games or just like fun, pick it up. Chances are you're not gonna regret it.			",386,75,6,55,26,7,43

												Binding of Issac is a small indie game from the offices of Newgrounds, and like every Newground game, its simple and sweet to keep your attention for your torrent of ""The Dark Knight"" to download.The game is a simple thriller, 3rd person static shooter around the character of Issac as he escapes his homicidal, Christian mother through a maze of dungeons. Using tears and demonic and unique items to kill his chlorinated genepool creations of his  (I guess) brothers. The game is small in size and relatively simple mechanics to grasp the game play easily. Plus the graphical style is so good it looked develpoted in the designers' Mother's basement. Overall it's a good game to play when you don't want to spend the time loading Fallout or a heavy game like L4D.			",57,2,1,3,2,3,4

The game is $5 you can't complain, for an extra $2.50 it's $7.50 which is lunch money. Some times it can be $3.75 for the game and it's DLC. The DLC unlcoks more wepons, powerups, enemies, bosses and stages so it's worth the pocket change. There are unlockable characters bossess tons of secrets, wepons and power ups half the game is luck half the game is skill which do u have? Fun Indie Game 7/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

It's a pretty addictive game, but it's also nice to sit down and play for 30-40 mins at a time, which is about a full run if you complete the whole thing.  There is a ton of replayability as well, if you can get over the initial hurdle of it being slightly difficult until you unlock more items. Definitely my favorite game I own on steam, and I'd certainly suggest buying it, because it's so cheap for so many hours of enjoyment.			",212,105,4,48,27,2,22

Do you wish they had a random element so you weren't playing the same game over and over and over again?  Are you also the kind of sick deviant who likes abortion and poop jokes in games?  Then do we have a game for you!Seriously, this game will become very rapidly addictive.  It's incredibly tough but very fun.  You'll wind up having a few really bad playthroughs and then one where everything goes right.  Somehow its worth it.			",348,79,4,32,12,1,19

												When there is a 2010's 'Indie Game Hall of Fame', The Binding of Issac will be one of its first inductees. Ed McMillen and Florian Himsl's top down rougelike dungeon crawler is a zebra in a field of wild horses. Its themes are what videogames and films try to avoid like the bubonic plague. In fact, I wouldn't be suprised if one of the bosses in this game has the bubonic plague (I'm looking at you, Gurdy). Infanticide, abortion, child abuse, and the idea that religion brainwashes would have some marketing departments cleaning out their desks. But this beautful departure isn't where The Binding of Issac shines. The gameplay is solid gold. The Legend of Zelda is a huge influence, and the game touts it well. Replayabilty is off the charts thanks to randomized levels, items, and boss fights. The pacing of difficulty and item unlocks as you progess feels reasonable. The soundtrack composed by Danny Baranowsky provides an added dimension into the hell that is Issac's basement, and its a damn good one. The community surrounding this game is extremely dedicated, constantly creating lore for a game that leaves a lot of blanks. The ""Wrath of the Lamb DLC"" (2012), and recently added ""Eternal Edition"" (2015) added substantial content to the game. Do yourself a favor and play this game until your eyes bleed (I hear toothpicks for your eyelids will help).			",64,11,0,3,1,0,2

												I've played this game for about 100 or so hours, just not on steam. And if you don't own this, at the time of this review, you can get the base game and the DLC for $1. Or 100 pennies. 20 nickels. 4 quarters. You can't beat that. Pick it up.Anyways, actual review time.TONS of replayability. But be warned: if you're playing this game for the first time, it's hard. It does not hold your hand. The items that you pick up don't even have descriptions of what they do. But fear not! The Binding of Isaac wiki will be your new Bible (pun slightly intended, for those of you that have played Isaac) for about the first 50 runs or so. But about that difficulty....it's hard, yes. But the satisfaction you feel after killing Mom for the first time is probably the most accomplished I've felt pressing certain keys and watching things happen on a screen. Worth every penny.

												The Binding of Isaac appears to be a very addictive game. You start out with only a few rooms to go through to kill Mom, but after that, the game expands more, so you have to play through it longer. I certainly died a lot of times before defeating Mom, and later her heart. The way that each time you play generates a different map set-up helps in making the game very addictive. If you play this game, get ready to become very involved in it. Overall, I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy addictive gameplay.			",51,10,1,4,4,1,8

												What a great game!I bought this game in the Steam Winter Sale, when it was available for 0,66€ including the DLC. I saw some gameplay-videos before, but never found it particularly interesting. However, that changed a few weeks ago when a friend of mine told me that it was quite fun. So I decided to give it a try for a that cheap price. What shall I say...? I have never been that addicted to a game in such a short time! It's an indie masterpiece.The Characters:You are playing as one out of seven characters. By default, only Isaac is unlocked, for the others you have to achieve certain victories or find certain items in order to unlock them. Each character has it's own pros and cons, so it's pretty much up to the player which one to play.The Story:Actually, there's not much story in the game. To sum it up, it'd be as follows (no spoilers, d'oh!): Isaacs' mum which is a strong believer in some kind of god, wants to kill you, because her ""god"" told her to do so. It is up to you to get stronger by finding items and unlocking more and powerful abilities (which come with items) to finally kill your mum. Voilà.The Gameplay:Basically, in The Binding of Isaac you run through small areas (called rooms). There are 6 levels until you get to the bossfight. Each level contains of around 5 to 15 areas. But don't let these small numbers fool you! The game is insanely challening, I'm hardly able to reach level 4 by now, and if I do, I was insanely lucky with the items. Speaking of items, they upgrade your basic stats or change something about your abilities. For example, you might get +1 attack, get faster, get a buddy who shoots enemies whenever you shoot, or get a stronger attack.There's a main attack (your tears) and a secondary attack, which is fired when pressing spacebar. The main attack can be upgraded by finding items, however, in order to get a secondary attack, you will only have one when you find a secondary-attack item.Except when using certain items you have one live only. When you die, you have to start at zero again, no items, no buffs, nothing. However, your HP can be upgraded or degraded, but it still required skill to beat the game.Information about the graphics and certain gameplay elements:Most of the items you'll find will mutilate your character. This sometimes looks quite gross, especially if you consider the young age of the main protagonist, Isaac. So if you're a squeamish person, you might want to take this into account. However, the graphics are in no way hyperrealistic, which minimalizes this problem I guess.Summary:If I had to use points in order to show, how good or bad the game is, here is what it'd look like:Graphics: 6/10 (awesome animations, everything looks sweet, but it's quite repetitive)Gameplay: 10/10 (insanely nice working, hard but fair)Story: WHO CARES?Addiction-level: 8/10 (I don't know yet how long this game will entertain me, but at the moment it's freaking addictive)Fun-level: 10/10 (this is very personal, ofc.)PS: There's sometimes a problem with the achievements, meaning you can't unlock them. Then you have to follow some guides in order to be able to unlock them. If you're an achievement-hunter, this might be interesting for you.			",90,12,3,11,14,0,13

												Let me start this review by saying that I hated the game at the beginning so much that I wrote a negative review about it. I hated the bugs, the lags because of the poor (flash based) game engine and of course the ultra-hard difficulty. So why did I change my opinion about it? Well, I still kinda hate it but not in a bad way :)The Binding of Isaac is a game for hardcore gamers! Period. We all have been spoiled by the new(er) games with lengthy tutorials, huge amounts of hints and by a difficulty so easy that you're asking yourself if the game is made for kids. Not with this game! The difficulty is hard. Extremely hard! You need to have fast reflexes, think and move smart and if all else fails then only luck can save you. Even when you know all of the dirty tricks and moves of your enemies, there's still no guarantee you won't get hit and eventually die. It's always a challenge no matter how good you're at it and on top of that the randomly generated levels offer endless replay value.Long story short; this game will make you a better gamer overall. You don't believe me? Now hear me out. I just collected the final achievement called ""Platinum God!"" and the feeling is amazing. I feel like I can tackle and complete every game out there. It was worth every hour I spent with the game even though I was mad, frustrated, angry and in a rage quit mood quite often. Be warned though. You need a lot of patience, skills and balls of steel to beat this game. So if you're a casual gamer avoid it all cost.GG!			",80,13,0,15,3,1,10

Cry or DieA former shell of a boy turned lump-of-flesh, Isaac must endure the horrors of lost siblings that never came to be. These undead fetuses are hellbent on destroying Isaac's very way of living and are very angry, that is to say, not only at him but at his mother even more so. Mom receives a godsend message from the Lord one day, asking her to prove her devotion and faith by sacrificing her son, Isaac. Who knows if his late brothers and sisters suffered the same fate, but one thing's for certain, Isaac isn't going to wait to find out!Overall, the top-down arcade style of The Binding of Isaac is great fun to be had. The levels are generated at random each time, and knowing this, makes for high replay value... from an indie game no doubt! Enemies are unique in appearance, there are various items with special capabliities, and plus, you take down your foes by crying a surge of tear drops! Poor Isaac... more fun for us then!

												When there is a 2010's 'Indie Game Hall of Fame', The Binding of Issac will be one of its first inductees. Ed McMillen and Florian Himsl's top down rougelike dungeon crawler is a zebra in a field of wild horses. Its themes are what videogames and films try to avoid like the bubonic plague. In fact, I wouldn't be suprised if one of the bosses in this game has the bubonic plague (I'm looking at you, Gurdy). Infanticide, abortion, child abuse, and the idea that religion brainwashes would have some marketing departments cleaning out their desks. But this beautful departure isn't where The Binding of Issac shines. The gameplay is solid gold. The Legend of Zelda is a huge influence, and the game touts it well. Replayabilty is off the charts thanks to randomized levels, items, and boss fights. The pacing of difficulty and item unlocks as you progess feels reasonable. The soundtrack composed by Danny Baranowsky provides an added dimension into the hell that is Issac's basement, and its a damn good one. The community surrounding this game is extremely dedicated, constantly creating lore for a game that leaves a lot of blanks. The ""Wrath of the Lamb DLC"" (2012), and recently added ""Eternal Edition"" (2015) added substantial content to the game. Do yourself a favor and play this game until your eyes bleed (I hear toothpicks for your eyelids will help).			",64,11,0,3,1,0,2

												This game teaches you to wash your hands before food.Indeed, if you pay attention - you'll see that all your enemies are, in fact, hallucinations of your vivid unstable child's mind. They are grotesque versions of himself, trying to bully him.The reason for all this is quite simple: your hero (Isaac) doesn't like wearing clothes and touches a lot of dirty things: spoons, shoes, hourglass (very dirty), mom's panties, etc.Germs are transmitted very easily, and since you play as a child with a weak immune system, it's very likely that you've caught something because of your careless behaviour.You deserve to die.

												I've played this game for about 100 or so hours, just not on steam. And if you don't own this, at the time of this review, you can get the base game and the DLC for $1. Or 100 pennies. 20 nickels. 4 quarters. You can't beat that. Pick it up.Anyways, actual review time.TONS of replayability. But be warned: if you're playing this game for the first time, it's hard. It does not hold your hand. The items that you pick up don't even have descriptions of what they do. But fear not! The Binding of Isaac wiki will be your new Bible (pun slightly intended, for those of you that have played Isaac) for about the first 50 runs or so. But about that difficulty....it's hard, yes. But the satisfaction you feel after killing Mom for the first time is probably the most accomplished I've felt pressing certain keys and watching things happen on a screen. Worth every penny.

												This game is amazing. I have over 100 hours logged in it and I'm stil enjoying it.PROS- Random runs provide limitless entertainment, no two runs are the same, there are a lot of different bosses and enemies to face giving another element of replayability to the game, SO MANY ITEMS and different combinations to discover, it is fairly well balanced, there is a clear progression from early game to end game, you will get a massive ego boost when you beat each end boss for the first time, it's great to play while listening to music and podcasts as it requires no extreme concentration for a majority of the game and has little dialogue.CONS- There are a few bugs graphically but nothing that will impact your enjoyment, it's addictingNEUTRAL- There isn't much in-game explanation but trial, error and googling will give you more than enough informationOVERALL- BUY THIS GAME AND WRATH OF LAMB! This is one of my favorite games of all time and I cannot wait for the remake that is slated for later this year.			",157,28,2,10,20,3,15

												Binding of Isaac is a lot like your third wife. You're not really expecting a lot out of her, but she surprises you some. My first glimpses at the game via screenshots showed a disturbing creation that I was not interested. Eventually it's standards dropped low enough, and I picked it up.  After I sank a little time in, I could tell this one was good. This game also imrpessed me with the amount of time that it can be played.. So although the visuals may not be what you are use to, you will be very happy if you let your friend set you up with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was hesitant to buy the game at first because I had never played one of its type; however, I got it on sale and I would have payed full price. It is insanely addictive and presents and incredible challenge full of strange and horrifying monsters and items sprinkled with terribly dark humor. I will admit it may not be the best game for the faint heart or those who don't want to kill a fetus inside their mother's womb, but if that sounds like fun to you this is definitley the game for you. 10/10 would buy again.

												This game is fantastic, something other games should strive towards. With an extremely cheap price,  (less than a dollar during most sales), this game offers more replay value than most others, with randomly generated floors, items, and layouts of individual rooms. This game is easy to learn how to play, but difficult to master, but that's why I find it so great. With challenges, tons of items to unlock, different characters and over 10 endings, this game has lots of things to find, use, and synergize with eachother. I've played this game for over 100 hours because there is no one way of doing things when everything is randomized. I give this game a 10/10			",107,23,1,8,10,1,2
