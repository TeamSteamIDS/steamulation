												It's been said before, it needs to be said again. This is not Dungeon Keeper. It is not close to Dungeon Keeper. It will not fill the void in your heart left by Dungeon Keeper.My biggest gripe: trying to set up an economy using this system requires a tedious amount of micro-management: You need enemy heroes to be able to easily get to your loot, then intercept them before they easily get away with it. By definition, this means you need to change something about your set-up on the fly, for every hero, in real time. A slog that misses everything about what made the genre fun.			",64,36,2,27,12,2,39

												First off, this is definitely not Dungeon Keeper. With that out off the way, this game is good in it's own right. The first couple levels are basically tutorials and are slow, but if you get past the first couple it does become more challengeing. When I first bought this game I had the idea that it would play similar to the Dungeon Keeper games. Upon playing it I was frustrated that it wasn't and promptly removed it and didn't play it again for a long while. However, one day I decided to reinstall and give it a shot without comparing it, to my surprise I wanted to play more.Your objective is to give the heroes that enter your dungeon everything they want filling their soul meters, then destroy them before they get a chance to leave your dungeon. Using their souls to buy ""gimmicks"" that you use to fill your dungeon leading the heroes throughout it, and making you more powerful. There is a balance you need to strike to get the heroes happy without having your creatures accidently slay them to soon, and losing soul energy in the process, as yourself the ""Dungeon Lord"" gets more soul energy from killing the heroes personally. I find trying to build my dungeon in such a way to completly fill the heroes soul bars and leading them to my dungeon heart, where I await them, to be challengeing and statisfing. I rate it 7/10, because I thoroughly enjoy playing it. But at times it has crashed while trying to autosave and there are a couple missions that are still broke and cannot be completed. Just give it a chance it may surprise you, like it did for me.			",52,15,0,32,21,0,31

												Save your money buy Dungeons ii.  This game is overly complicated and you feel like you aren't really running a dungeon.  You feel like you are the dungeon overlord who has to do the work completely by himself by killing all the adventurer's yourself because your bats, rats, etc don't see to do much work and seem to be reliant on the adventurer's attacking them.  You also can't pick them up and move them where you want to like you can in Dungeons ii where it feels like you are actually running a dungeon instead of just going around with your main guy and attacking Adventurer's.  Also you have to get something archaic called Soul Energy from the Adventurer's which means you have to let them beat up your creatures, steal you gold, etc so their green bars go up before you kill them because they are worth more soul energy that way and you can lock them up in cages to get some extra soul energy also.  Problem is this means adventurer's pile up in your dungeon meaning you might have to fight multiplies at once making your job tougher since your main guy is the only one that seems to do any of the killing.  You also get archaic Prestige points that allow you to build ""gimmicks"" to occupy the adventurer's and make their soul energy production go up as well.  I am glad that I bought Dungeons ii first or I might have got turned off this title line.  If I had bought dungeons i first there is a good chance I would never have discovered what a great game dungeons ii is in actually managing a dungeon instead of just attacking like some arcade game with your main guy.  In dungeons ii your objective is to kill the adventurer's as quickly as possible not let them hang out and get tougher.Save your money buy dungeons ii if you want a real game in this genre.  I absolutely love that game but can't see myself putting any more time into dungeons i as it seems pointless.  Also you can't see your entire dungeon like you can in dungeons ii and it's very dark and hard to see exactly what is going on.  The creatures are much larger and more visible in dungeons ii.

												The idea is nice, but the implementation is not.The game creators compare it to Diabolo and Dungeon Keeper. I'm not the Diabolo fanboy, but Dungeon Keeper is a way better game that this one. The good: visuals, some scenarios in campaign. The average: gameplay, magic system, skill system, in-game jokes.The bad: controls, building system (there are a lots of build items which are essentially the same).The ugly: launching the game (you need to pass 3 screens to simply launch the game).The verdict: I'm not going to play this game ever again.

												NOT like Dungeonkeeper except in the shallowest of ways. There's no mass battles with heroes, and your minions don't fight them, not really. Instead you find dungeon entrences, put a hallway across from them with a bit of treasure at the other end, and a corneer to hide behind. Heroes arrive one at a time, on a timer, see the gold, go to pick it up, and once they're done, you club them and have a goblin drag them back to the dungeon. By this point the hero arrival timer is almost up again, and you do wait for the next one to come along, find treasure, get clubbed, etc and you do this until you realize the whole game is just doing this over and over and get tired of it.

												As an old fan of Dungeon Keeper. I was thrilled to hear this was supposed to be a spiritual successor to that series.... Then I played the game. DUNGEONS at the very least LOOKS like Dungeon Keeper, but that's about where it stops being a ""spiritual successor"". As much as I liked the fact you were an actual evil overlord that could roam freely through your dungeon, and while the heroes that would regularly come to your dungeon to battle monsters and loot treasure was a nice touch. It lacked the one thing that would have made the game actually WORK. The free roaming monsters. DUNGEONS wanted to be DK's spiritual successor, but instead just slapped a coat of paint on itself to make it LOOK like a proper successor, then did it's own thing that I found completely disapointing. So... No. Didn't like it. Not at all.			",122,25,0,22,8,3,7

												First thing that needs to be said is that this is and never will be Dungion Keeper 3 (go to War for the Overworld for that).But if you enjoy the idea of heros as little more then a cash crop, then you will enjoy this game. The idea is simple; each hero is worth very little when they enter your dungion, but depending on how you design it they get fat, like good little pigies, and then when rip, you cut them down. This is how you gain the important resources of the game. Each type of hero as different needs and as the game progresses new hero types arive, more stuff gets unlocked ect. Theirs some good humior, but unless you enjoy playing with the heros as above then this game become repititive after mission 5. The music is good and the graphics are nice, but even as someone who enjoyed this game its a 6/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I thought I liked the game, but in the end it is rather dull.  It tries to be like Dungeon Keeper, but it doesn't do a very good job at it.  I found playing in sandbox to be a little too irritating as I can never remember which maps give me what toys to play with.  For example, one map may let you use traps and another may not.  In all honsety, play Evil Genius instead.			",328,39,3,45,27,2,32

												First of all: THIS GAME IS NOT DUNGEON KEEPER. Even if it is a ""spiritual successor"", it still isn't the same game. If you want Dungeon Keeper, go and play Dungeon Keeper.The game is good and simple and the campaing is a good way to spend some time and the costume game is good to spend some time and challegne yourself. It's not the best game ever, but it still is a good game.I don't think the game is good enough to worth it's full price, but it sure worth with a good discount.			",386,64,2,87,15,2,58

												I don't think I have ever been this depressed by a game before. As the spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper, I had very high hopes for this game. It is, saddly, terrible. Everything that made the previous game unique and interesting (monsters moving into and interacting with your dungeon, converting enemies to your cause, waging war against the forces of good,) have all been stripped away. Yes, you can place monsters in your dungeon and have them protect narrow areas, but they don't roam the area, they don't interact with your dungen, and there are very few types available. The troll/blacksmiths are gone, and so are their traps, doors, and other gadgets to make the dungeon interesting. The prisons remain, but the Mistresses are gone so enemies can't be converted. The only reason you even capture them is to get soul energy out of them.You no longer wage war. Yes, you can fight heroes, and your mosnters will too. However, you can no longer send your monsters after heroes, they will only engage if the hero happens to stumble into them. Of course, you wouldn't want to send monsters after heroes aanymore either, since they need to survive to be fattened up with soul energy.It is like they tooke the most basic features of Dungeon Keeper, kept those, and threw away everything that gave the game character. Now, you must run about taking care of every little task using your avatar, with no help from the decorative monsters. Basically, this has become FarmVille with a slightly darker background and sub-par voice acting.			",69,14,0,17,16,0,15

												So many people complained about Dungeons and gave it a bad name simply because ""it's not dungeon keeper"".It wasn't intended to be a dungeon Keeper, only inspired by it; which not many people seemed to understand the difference between.This doesn't stop it from being a good game.I loved Dungeon Keeper as much as everyone else and always wanted to see a return of it however I still had plenty of time spent on this (Outside of steam so more than the amount shown.)If you can go into it without expecting to be playing Dungeon Keeper it's a really well made and fun game.The only similarity is that it's in a dungeon, you have workers (goblins) which will dig the walls out, maintain your placed objects and bring you gold. The whole concept and game play/mechanics are a different thing altogether.In dungeons, you control the dungeon lord who can roam the dungeon instead of being the large god hand. You don't cater for your creatures, you aim to please the humans that come down.They have different needs and are impressed by a wide verity of interactions.As the humans travel through your amusement dungeon they interact with the scenery objects (gimmicks) and the rooms you build.When they do this, they will gain 'soul energy' until they are fully satisfied and will head back out the dungeon... however that soul energy is what you are after and letting them escape will lose this valuable resource used to create a more impressive dungeon, killing them or torturing them is the way to collect it before they leave.Creatures are summoned by placing a summoning location down, these are unlocked by having getting a nest within your influence area, which you expand by placing the summoning locations.These creatures will stay in close proximity to the spawn and fight any of the humans that they see. Whilst they can kill the humans it's not the main purpose. Some of the needs are related to combat weather it's to deal damage or be hit, creatures will fulfil this need.There's no management for the creatures, they don't require sleep or food.You will need to manage your hero quite a bit, making sure to kill people when it's time and also to protect the dungeons heart, if destroyed you will lose.This happens if the humans are unhappy with the dungeon and would rather destroy it. They can also decide to attack after sharing their experiences with each other as the humans do like to talk to one another meaning one unhappy person can trigger others to join.Dungeons is definitely worth playing if you liked Dungeon keeper (who doesn't?) and are willing to accept that it's not the same game but still want a dungeon management game.

												So, there were these games called Badman (and a really freaking long name with My Lord in it that I never can remember) released by NIS for the PSP -- there was also these games called Dungeon Keeper. Now there is the Quest for Epic Loot (which is like MMO...ish) and Imps and . .. kay, bored now.Point is, this is it's own game. This is micro-management-heavy-as-hell and on top of that, lacks a certain pizaz that gets things to keep going after 20 hours or so (note: I played this a lot before this most recent sale on steam in which I acquired it here) . The biggest customization is nearly meaningless decor. So much is too complecated in practice and yet overly simple in feeling .. which is all sorts of weird (mostly comes from how easy it is to kill heroes on entering without pleasing them) --- this game, like many, requires you to give to it in order to give back. Unlike the best games which tend to be lower on the graphical scale and ask imagination -- this is a dressed up version (kinda) of a lot of things and the missing bits are the innate charm, and the strange feeling of -something- missing.What am I on about? This is not Dungeon Keeper. Stop pretending it sucks because of that. This is a solid 7 out of 10 (saying 5 is passing for a 20 USD game) -- this game is good, and above average (but actually less impressive for the year it was released than this last 12 months. .then it was only a 6, but 2013 sucked on every possible level). More importantly, the gold pack with the standalone DLC was 7.50 USD for me, and that is a GREAT deal. a good 30 hours of enjoyment between the two, and only a few hours of lacklustre play in there. Not the best game ever, but I do recommend it.			",315,82,7,97,43,1,69

												They definately tried to grab that Dungeon Keeper vibe but the game itself is it's own game that borrows elements of it - right down to the very simular CGI cut scenes.  The simularaties are so uncanny many (myself included) thought they were trying to make a cheap knockoff.Once you figure out it's not Dungeon Keeper and figure out how it works, you start to get an appreciation for what it really is - a satire of fantasy dungeons and the players who play them.  You then dig into the game further and watch how it lampoons all the popular favorites right down to Diablo and does it with a self awareness that Dungeons itself is NOT to be taken anymore seriously than the game it borrows inspiration from.Indeed, I think Dungeons probably did a better job nailing the satire of fantasy dungeon crawls than anybody - it indeed did NOT DESERVE the flak it got for appearing to be a knockoff.While you have a dungeon heart and workers that dig out your dungeon, the simularities end there.  Where Dungeon Keeper looked at the heroes as an invader to be destroyed, Dungeons approaches Heroes as an important resource.  You see, your dungeon is there to entertain them, and make them gain soul energy.  When they have sufficient soul energy or make themselves too much of a nuisance - you knock them down and imprison them to harvest them for soul energy.  In essense, they are your cattle to be cared for till it's time to slaughter and harvest them.Dungeons also gives the Dungeon Lord an actual avatar - a wandering nightmare mob that you the player have control of.  Anotherwords, YOU ARE THE DUNGEON EPIC BOSS.Said soul energy is used to build gimmicks - which are essentially the decorations for your dungeon.  Each gimmick raises the prestige of your dungeon, which in turn directly influences your power by unlocking stronger monster and better devices to better care for your little hero piglets.  Pretige also directly influences the strength of your Avatar.Soul energy also serves as the currency you use to raise the universal level of all your monsters, and is also used for other odd purchases such as creating a guardian for your dungeon heart, or increasing the number of workers you can have.It's not all screams and sacrifices though - your actions of harvesting said heroes comes at a cost.   The more you destroy, the more it ticks down a timer that spawns a champion.  Said champion can be thought of as the end-game player.  Maxed level and fully geared - his only goal is to destroy epic mobs - like you.  His presense aggrivates the other heroes and unites them in his cause - and thus you have to deal with him. Oh, there's also the other weakling dungeon lords that invade your realm - but that's another story.Game deserves a chance - I'll probably pick up it's sequal soon. ",198,11,5,23,10,3,26

												I bought this game a while back knowing full well it was not dungeon keeper ( i have both DK 1 & 2 original cd's..yeah I'm an old gamer) I found it was a good challange and had some fun with it but sadly my pc was not up to par and I had to uninstall the game. I now have a very good gamer pc so I redownloaded the game only to find that there is a new launcher.  I signed up for a new account, verified the email, copied the activation code, logged into to new launcher....""key already in use""...I go to the website itself to ask for support....Login info invalid?????? Another case of buy my game and jump through hoops to even play it or just say forget it and move on so they still got your money for nothing. I personaly have boycotted a few companies for these very practices..Startrek online..SWTOR...just to name a few. Summary, the game itself is fun if you like a good strategy / dungeon making type game, If you like jumping through hoops just to play a game and like the run around and have a snowballs chance in Hades of getting into the actual game itself...then by all means spend that hard earned cash to get ripped off.

												I do recall bashing this game on a internet forum I have now been permo-banned from and for some time now (Unrelated to me being banned!) I have regretted sharing with that community how much I though of this game when I played it a few times. I think it the demo, that dissappointed me at first....and why I never purchase a retial version of this game and then I played the demo again here vai Steam and started to get into it once I got used to the control scheme/playing system for it.The problem was that I was looking for a worthy successor to Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2, because number never mad eit past the drawing boards and that was that!There are a fewl clones of this that original game from the early 90's, but the best ones are Delvers, and the unoffical Sequel War for the Overworld (Or some similar name!) and there is sequle for Dungeons as well.I like dungeons now, it ceraintly has found it's own niche and it really it's own game, but that sequle is something else. Hoping it's difference had nothing to do with me.Enjoy and check out games like it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is clearly inspired by them which can be seen by the many similarities, though this game shines on its own with its innovation.

The economy doesn't make much sense, and I ended up throwing my money at things without it making much of a difference. There was no actual decisions made while spending money.The skill tree was kind of a stupid idea. They added on bells and whistiles without the core gameplay: building a dungeon, being fleshed out.Often times they would have multiple objectives, but they would be contradictory and not fun.

												Remember Dungean Keeper? This is a lot like that, but with a better premise (IMHO). So you're an evil overlord. But rather than wanting to keep adventurers out of you dungeon, you WANT them to come in, get their jollies, have the time of their life, then capture them and suck all the joy out of their souls.That's a gross simplification, but that's the basic idea. This is sort of like a TD game, in that you have invaders coming into your place and you need to direct them to where you want them to go. But instead of trying to kill them quickly, you essentially want to kill them slowly. You need to give them a good fight, let them find some treasure, maybe even get them laid (not really, but that would be totally expected in this game). THEN you want to imprison them and suck all that contented adventurous soul out of their well-satisfied bodies.Very fun, very much in keeping with the tradition established by Dungeon Keeper and Overlord.I give it a B+			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												If you never rage-quit a game this one might be for you.  The game itself is not hard but almost any mistake will cost you a level restart.  Example: I setup a small dungeon in sandbox mode and opened my first gate, only to find that as opposed to spawning single hero it spawns parties of heroes.  As a result my forces were quickly overwhelmed and I had to restart.  Gate itself didn't have any marking to distinguish itself from other gates.  This is just one example but I keep running into similar scenarios.  Could be that it is my noobery but then again after giving this game couple of tries I feel like its just a waste of my time.  Let me know if you had a different experience.			",138,23,1,22,33,3,37

												Dungeons was plauged from it's only predecessor Dungeon Keeper. Since that was the only other game to have you play the evil dungeon lord killing heroes, and a most beloved game by players worldwide. Most people expected this game to be Dungeon Keeper 3. It was not.. Dungeons has you creating a dungeon with rooms that will wow and fancy heroes. Once they are fully satisfied on questing in your lair you send your minons to kill them and harvest their happiness. Unlike Dungeon Keeper where you built a dungeon with rooms dedicated to spawning units and using them to attack or defend objectives. Dungeons works in a zone of control style, you build rooms near the creature spawners and you then control that unit type. The whole thing feels a bit like Theme Park for D&D. If you wanted to relive the glory days of Dungeon Keeper then go to Good Old Games and grab a copy. I do like Dungeons and recommend it. For the low price of $15 it almost feels like a steal.

												Dungeons is an awesome game.  The game has several different modes, including one of my favorites the ""Sandbox"" mode where you simply build a dungeon and allow heroes to gain as many soul points as possible and meet with their demise in your evil hands.  Lots of people compare this game to the classic ""Dungon Keeper"" game and while they have some simliartes, Dungeons has far better graphics, the game play is more modern and overall the game is different.  This is a must have in my opinon! :)			",272,20,0,31,18,1,37

												I was surprised by the negative reviews. This game is fun, if you like time management and quirky stuff. No, it isn't dungeon keeper, and no where does it claim to be dungeon keeper. You can't just assume it's the same because they start with the same word. It's not necessary to give so many negative reviews to a game because you miss your childhood favorites.Basically, it's like all the time management business games, except your income is how happy you make the raiding heroes before you kill them. It's got elements of city building and sims style designing to personalize the dungeon however you like. And it's got a cute goth feel to it, with clumsy imps and demanding demons.It's a bit more complex then your standard restaurant time management game, and you need to stay on top of what is going on everywhere in your dungeon. If you don't plan it out and design the layout well, it'll fall apart when you're so close to winning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: Dungeons is a game with an interesting concept, however once you get past the excitement of something different to your usual RTS... It just becomes repetitive. Don't buy at full price.Dungeons is a game where rather than building up your lair, recruiting forces, and ultimately taking over the ""upper realm"" by force, you instead aim to coax heroes into your dungeon, increase their happiness through them finding gold, fighting (and beating) your minions, finding weapons, and research. You then kill them to take back this happiness as soul power. The game starts off slowly as you try to become accustomed to this, but then accelerates into you having to manage all of these, as well as ensuring your main objectives are met, to prioritising spending on dungeon improvements or objectives. Which is all well and good, except it's the same formula, and as you get towards the end of the campaign, all you dungeon building is taken care of already.I blitzed through the campaign and as it is an older game, did not try the multiplayer. Buy this game on sale for a bit of enjoyment, but don't expect to have your mind blown.			",146,12,0,17,16,1,34

												First off, this is NOT a Dungeon Keeper clone.Second, I can NOT recommend anyone to buy it.So the game basically looked like Dungeon Keeper from the trailers, however it plays completely different (it play like Dungeon Lords or something according to Steam Forums). I did not like this because you are tasked with base building and at the same time to micro your hero in killing adventurers that go into your base. However you only want to kill/capture them when they have filled their satisfaction meter to max. This is doubly annoying when you cannot control your other forces so your hero can be somewhere else. This all ends up in a whole lot of micromanagement and stress for the player.The game is also quite low-budget, the price set for it is highly overrated, I would value this game at about 30€ due to content and quality of execution. I cannot recommend buying this unless its at 5€ though, and even then I would be a hard sale.Do not buy.			",510,139,5,56,39,3,57

												Company abuses Steam systems to get their game greater visibility while on sale by calling it an 'update'.  Do you really want to buy a game from a company that thinks doing that counts as a good business practice?That out of the way, game is horrifyingly grindy to get anything done.  Decorating your dungeon loses all entertainment value when you HAVE to do it for advancement.  At times I can't help but feel they decided to make a Dungeon Keeper clone, and used the mobile app as their reference.It has fun bits, I can remember having fun, but the long, slow grind to level up at the start of each map has sucked out all memory of just what it was that was keeping me entertained.  Seriously, I play clicker games for fun, and even I found this game boring and repetitive.			",131,16,3,37,51,2,74

												Because this is on sale I cannot stress this enough:  DO NOT BUY - NO GOOD! NO FUN! This might be the single worst game I've ever purchased off steam, however I am extremely happy to be able to write a review of it now.  I loved Tropico so was familiar with the publisher, and I loved the old dungeon keeper (I am aware this was not suppose to be a clone of that game so thats fine) so I loved the theme of this game.  Thus I preoredered game, and so so sorely disappointed when it came out that after 2 hours I uninstalled.  The game is boring, crude, and full of a whole lot of nothing. No depth, no creativity, no fun.  I could go on and on about how much I hate this game but I will just thank steam for finally putting up a player review system I think this will be good thing. -Demon			",143,50,2,40,34,2,48

												Boring!  This game excels at being boring! BORING!!!  The gameplay is one-dimensional (leave treasure for hero, ambush hero, thats the gist).  I have to wait minutes between each hero's visit. Just waiting and waiting.  This game is also a poor teacher; critical features (like leveling up your monsters) are never taught by the game, I just stumbled on the tiny (barely 9x9pixel) button that levels up creatures on my own.  But the gameplay isn't the worst thing about this game. No the worst part is the voice acting!  Every single character with speaking lines talks like someone reading a script for the first time: slow and awkwardly.  The worst offender is the little narrator goblin man.  He speaks so slowly its painful.One has the option to skip the speaking parts by hitting the space key, but each time a speaking sequence starts, it steals my focus and starts a mini-cutscene, stealing precious extra seconds from my life that I will never get back as I march forward towards the grave.This game is like a nursing home, its slow, its tedious, its filled with people that talk way too slowly about things I don't care about (""OH, OH DO I CLICK THE HERO TO ATTACK IT?! THANKS FOR THE TIP!!!"").  Everything about this game is purpose designed to waste my time: the slow gameplay, the slow voice acting, the slow character leveling, the dense UI,  and Kalypso even makes one sign up for a ""Kalypso Account"" and do an email confirmation before one can even play the game.

												I'd read the reviews, and thought I was going in with my eyes open. It wouldn't be like Dungeon Keeper -- more like the Sims, with some DK elements. Unfortunately, it's not that either. The controls are horrible. The narration is awful. The visuals are uninspired. The tutorial is wholly inadequate. The gameplay is tedious at its best. The game constantly invites comparison to DK (to the point of using dialogue lifted directly from DK), which adds insult to injury, but the fact that it's not DK is not this game's problem. Everything else is.			",15,13,0,16,3,0,1

												This game is lots of fun, the biggest flaw is that if goes so far trying to be funny that everything turns into a joke and you don't feel like the menacing dark, evil, dungeon lord. But other than that the game play is quite interesting and unique. You need to read some of the descriptions on everything, some are bleh but others are hilariously funny.Anyway there are three different levels each getting more complicated than the last and with a different theme for each. It is probably worth it normally, definitely worth it on sale. But watch out as there is a third party launcher so you have to go through steam and Calipso to get to the game.			",30,4,0,16,11,0,12

												NOT Dungeon Keeper. Not at ALL Dungeon Keeper. Despite what you may have seen or been led to belive this game is not related to Dungeon Keeper at all...except maybe roughly similar humor (though not as funny or effectivly delievered). However, what Dungeons is, is a Tychoon game, like railroad or rollercoaster or themepark tychoon. It's a humours game where you get to customize your dungeon keeper (you play the big boss basicly) and you build your dungeon in order to give heroes a ""good adventure"" inside of it, once they are happy and fat and pleased with themselves you beat the hell out of them and throw them in prison, sucking their soul energy, witch lets you build and further upgrade your dungeon. It's been threw enough patches to where it runs fine now, and it's a decent game for a on sale price (i wouldn't pay fll though). As long as your not expecting it to be Dungeon Keeper 3 you might actually enjoy the game.			",272,68,5,96,42,1,102

												Oh goodness, I can't say enough about thi game. I have lamented the death of Dungeon Keeper 3 for years, and finally it has been reborn in a modern form with new gameplay mechanics. The idea of harvesting soul energy from heroes you have pampered and 'built up', only to tear them down and lock them away is deliciously evil. Managing a dungeon in this manner can be difficult, (it's YOUR gold in those piles....so you end up running out fairly quickly if heroes take alot of it.) there's a good deal of micro management involved, as well as planning, room building, etc. All to tease those heroes with lovely jewels, books, equipment, and more, so you can suck all of that out of them when they fall. The soul energy collected goes to prestiege items which make your dungeon more impressive, and boost your power. So it's a bit of a roundabout buildup until you can build more prisons and have enough prestiege to easily deal with the invading heroes, and even champions. Lots of good stuff here!

												While it doesn't really live up to something like Dungeon Keeper II, this was a pretty good alternative. Setting up dungeons is relatively similar, and I personally found that aside from anything else the only thing the game lacked was difficulty. But let's face it, nobody plays these games for their stories, we play for pet/sandbox dungeons right?Well this delivers in the pet dungeon regard. The downside however, is that the deeper dungeons allowing traps and props, are significantly smaller than the largest one on the easier settings. Other than that, it's entertaining and that's all you can really ask of a game.			",134,17,1,28,8,2,21

												This game is nice. All i read about it though are people going full idiot and talking about a game in 1997 that hasn't aged too well. This isn't Dungeon Keeper, it never claimed to be Dungeon Keeper, nor is it trying to de-throne some soap box that everyone places Dungeon Keeper on. They're not the same game, get the ♥♥♥♥ over it.Anyhow. I am enjoying this game. The graphics are presentable, the humor is childish and flows well, and the strategy is moderate. Sure, you could just place a hallway and put a pile of gold on it, but you're going to be there a long time. Players who actually pay attention to what the game teaches you will learn about libraries and needs of adventurers. This one is a masochist, ergo if he finds whatever monster you plant that roughs him up, he's going to get happy. Greedy hero? Piles of gold fill are quickly stuffed into pockets by greedy adventurers. Nerd? Library.The formula is simple, and i can see the tedium in the later levels, but it has the customization and thought behind it that would appeal to the fans of games like Rollercoaster Tycoon and the like. This has a medium story behind it, so it keeps you entertained while pretty much helping you work on basic strategy.8/10 in my books.			",344,38,1,37,31,0,29

												I played this game off an on since it's release in 2011 and it still remains to be an extremely fun game (I received it again during a Bundlestars sale).   There's a lot of content here, what with the talent trees, buildable items, character progression, and campaign & skirmish modes.  Easily recommendable at the $2-3 sale price (until 11/3/14) and still so at the usual $15 price tag, especially for those who loved the Dungeon Keeper series.

												First and foremost if you are expecting a Dungeon Keeper 3, you will be dissapointed, although not completely so!This game bears more than a passing resemblance to Dungeon Keeper (and your advisor occasionaly makes a reference to the DK series) but it is certainly not a clone/reboot. it is more of a management game and would be more aptly named Hero FarmYou invite heroes into your dungeon and supply them with Gold to find and monsters to fight, books to read and swords to steal. This pampering enriches the hero's soul, and when it is full, you harvest the soul energy to make yourself even more powerful.If it's on sale I would recomend picking it up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do all Dungeon Sims have to be clones of Dungeon Keeper to be good games? NO.This game, can be better viewed as Sim Dungeon, much like Sim Park. The only real difference is you want the Enemy Heroes to enjoy themselves, before you cut them down and harvest them. If you are willing to look past the fact that it is a different game than a game came out over 15 years ago. Than their is enjoyable game to be had here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for Dungeon Keeper, keep looking. This game is essentially a theme park for people trying to kill you. Sure, you run a dungeon. Sure, there's a dungeon heart. Sure, there's goblins, and libraries and armories and monsters... but the library and armory is just something to make heroes happier, and your gold is mostly used to pile on the floor to keep heroes interested, all so that you can kill them before they decide to leave your amusement park and leave with the real currency of the game: soul energy.Honestly, it sucks. It's a decent enough game in its own right; not nearly worth the price or anyone's attention, but it should be shot for pretending to cater to the Dungeon Keeper crowd.That said, I guess it's okay if you pretend DK doesn't exist and this wasn't made to copy that much better series. I still don't recommend it for purchase, unless it's going for a few pennies and you feel like wasting money.			",181,18,0,40,37,1,40

												This game scores 65 on metacritic, but it is probably worth about 75 because a lot of the bugs and problems that plagued the game at launch have been fixed. I bought this for 3$ with both DLCs included, not expecting much, but i ended up playing it for about 6 hour stright and i am still far away from finishing the story. If you played ""Dungeon Keeper"" a long time ago then you already know what to expect, if you didn't, well you basically play an evil lord who build dungeons to trap heroes and take gold and souls from them to gain power. The controls are not ideal, and the graphics are a bit outdated (but very sufficient) in this day and age, but i am having fun and I recommend you check this one out.			",360,75,5,72,42,2,66

												Before i say anything, i want to say that this game is amazing. It is NOT THE SAME As dungeon Keeper, so everyone is like ""Ugh this game is terrible, its not anything like Dungeon Keeper like they say it is."" That is true, but its not terrible, its the exact opposite. I find this game incredibly fun. I was hooked the first hour i played. It's more of an Overveiw of the dungeon and you get to create monsters, gold, jails, stuff like that. But that's not what makes this unique. The Thing about it is, its not just keeping a dungeon, you also get to control a character. You can switch between Overveiw and Over the Shoulder veiw. So instead of just eltting your monsters do the work, the monsters do little and your main character does the most of it. So it is, in my opinion, a great example of an RPG/Strategy game that blends together perfectly.(BTW) This is my opinion that the game is great, yours may differ. (But im pretty sure you'll like it anyway :3)8.5/10			",409,58,2,75,31,6,55

												A poor copy of a classic game.  Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2 are surely shamed by this game considering the lack of effort put in here.  Graphics are nothing special and the control system is limited.  There’s nothing innovative about this game.  It’s just a weak attempt to cash in on an old-school classic.			",201,26,1,51,12,4,58

												Wish I read the reviews before I purchased this! They don't show on the bundle page as I bought the Gold edition, with the other packs. You never assume anything could possibly be this bad, that you wished you checked first. Why isn't it free??? When you watch the intro video, you're like ""Oh lots of blood and evil  everywhere! This games looks pretty cool and I could be a sadistic over lord laughing manically at the pain  inflicting in innocent, hedonistic ''  !!!"" :D ..But, No, it wasn't like that at all... it's full of humour and ... and really poor graphics and animation. I think the worst part of it is there wasn't a tutorial to tell me what was going on!!!! It was so bad I had to go find one on . Even there the guy was like .. game  is  so i show you this...

												I won't complain that this game isn't Dungeon Keeper. No matter how much I really want it to be War For The Overworld.This game is, however, more like what would happen if someone decided to try and mix Dota 2 and Dungeon Keeper.You have a physical pressence in the game you have to manually direct to attack, activate things and generally progress.While games like Baldurs Gate may spring to mind. this does not have much in the way of combat other than 'go attack that person... right, they died...'. There is no customisation of your 'keeper' further than leveling up to gain spells with real-time cool-downs...This might be better likened to Overlord, but without the cusomisation of your weapons... or the thrilling gameplay.I don't like games that have me watching for seconds, checking my mana, waiting for a specific moment between the slow, repeating combat animations and then unleashing some spell that i'm going to have to wait another 00:40 to use again. This is not Warcraft!The game quickly gets pissy and overly picky about what you need to do. The dynamic of 'let heroes in and let them get real happy to farm their souls' comes off as a little strange at best. Let them walk in, slay your creatures, then plunder the convenient piles of gold lay around?oh... kaay?kill them on their way out so you don't lose the gold and do gain their souls.Right?Ok, let's do that while trying to dig out some more rooms of your dungeon, expand your area of influence with pentagrams that summon enemies and need population points to build and build some decorations to give yourself prestiege. Don't forget to complete the challenges on each level to level up your guy to get better combat spells and that... did I forget to mention if you take too long, the next b*gger comes in and starts plundering somewhere else? Oh, and you're being attacked by someone else on the other side of your dungeon, better get back there. Better still, teleport somewhere even further away if you want to get there faster!uuh... no!There is too much fiddly, useless and over-complicated systems.I can't compare this to dungeon keeper. that would be an insult to both games.This has multiple 'currencies' to constantly keep an eye on as you're building. Lacking tutorials that leave you not entirely sure what you're supposed to be doing and, I hate to be mean, but if you're playing a game about managing a dungeon, i don't need to tell myself to walk over here so the hero doesn't see me before i kill him... honestly, it does not seem very well thought out.I would love to change my review, but this is too under-developed to be an MMO, far too far away from being simple enough to play casually and, to be frank, no fun.

												This game is kinda fun to begin with, but it unfortuanetly never does something new after the first few levels. After that, it's the same over and over again, with the occasional skin change. I feel this game needed more RTS style gameplay, too much is autopilot, the only thing you really do is build stuff, and too many items are the same thing with a new paintjob. I can actually kinda compare this game to the Sims, which is not good when you are catering to a complelty different audience :/.All in all, it's an okay game, but there is better things to spend your money on.

												Yes, this is not exactly Dungeon Keeper! And yes, it has a different game play as Dungeon Keeper . . . But, it is a fantastic game to play and even though it is not exactly a sequel to Dungeon Keeper . . . The DK feeling still comes up once you have past the 2nd map to play.At first I was like: ""Is this realy it?""Then the second map: ""I hope this is getting better!""Then finally the 3rd map: ""WOW!!! This is fun!""The first 2 maps are for learning the basics . . . then the learning curve goes right up and gets challenging. I have 14 odd hours into the game so far and I am enjoying every minute of it. It's realy like you don't want to stop playing it. Absolut fun game.I highly recommend it to all players, that liked the old Dungeon Keeper!!!. . .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game when it was on sale soley based off the fact I used to love the Dungeon Keeper series and this looked to be a spiritual successor of sorts.  Sadly, it feels and plays like a game that isn't quite finished.  The tutorial explains almost nothing beyond camera movements which would be fine if the game didn't have such a clunky UI that an explanation is almost mandatory to navigate it.  While I'm glad the game tried to work RPG elements in, I think it ended up pulling both the simulation and rpg down. There is fun to be had here, you just really have to work for it past the initial frustrations and some poor design choices.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons is a simple game, quite reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper. You are the ultimate dungeon lord, dethroned and betrayed by your ex-girlfriend Calypso. You and your faithful servant must work hard in  the evil hierarchy to regain your position as ultimate evil, fighting hero after hero, betraying dungeon master after dungeon master. Quite a fun game, if you are tired of playing the same holier than thou save the world kind of hero.			",213,56,3,26,24,1,35

												Sadly it's just not Dungeon Keeper.Still a decent game but instead of attracting creatures to your dungeon and freely designing and building said dungeon you have to capture lairs, each of which permit a certain number of creatures to be added to your dungeon. Different lairs unlock different creatures.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tried so hard to get into this game. Just couldn't. Big fan of DK which this game is not. It has some nice features, but badly designed. The tutorial missions are completely unclear on how to use the features and accomplish the goals. The interface is difficult to use and the game is just not clear how to play it. It's more frustrating than anything else.			",119,51,1,44,29,2,55

												Although this game makes many MANY references to the beloved Dungeon Keeper series, it falls far from the prize.  There is abolutely no strategy to Dungeons.  You don't create a dungeon to be proud of, so much as you build a playground for heroes to romp through but ultimately you have to kill them yourself since you have no direct or indirect control over absolutely anything.  It was nice that I didn't sink a full $50 or $60 into this mishap though, so I'm not TO upset.  A real disappointment, I MIGHT both finishing it. 2/5 stars			",104,19,1,23,20,1,31

												We all know that look hungry adventurer's get in their eye at the sight of heaps of treasure, mystical artifacts or horrid monsters to vanquish.  Most of us have been that hero before.  But what about the gleam in the eye of the Dungeon Lord as he watches his victims stroll through his lair, unaware of their impending fate as they gobble up all the goodies left strategically about to only lure them  into his dungeon?  Well this game lets you find out exactly what that is like.  Based off the classic Dungeon Keeper games, this RTS/Tycoon game puts you in-charge of your very own Dungeon, allowing you to build hundreds of rooms and corridors, decor them with items to bait curious adventurers, and create many traps and monsters to ultimately finish them off!  The goal: make your dungeon interesting enough to please adventurers til they are content, thus fulfilling their wishes and maxing their soul energy, and then killing/capturing them before they escape.  Tons of fun, a must-have!			",669,397,8,131,131,9,122

												Oh look guys, its a dungeon keeper remake, it even says dungeons on it. and it has the similar look to dungeon keeper, well i better buy this during a sale. played it for literally like an hour, found out you instead of controlling anything you JUST place terrible generic dungeon items, where the tooltips tell you literally nothing so it doesn't matter what you place or where and then you go into first person on your dungeon lord and slowly walk him to the end. thats it. game over. if you had the same game play but with an old persons home, creating pictures / bridge games / chess boards / bingo and you had to walk arthur to his bath this would be the same game. and please dont make that a DLC overhaul.

												Don't expect a cooler or even as cool version of the good old Dungeon Keeper.. The beginning of the game is very exiting, funny and inviting, but when you start playing you'll soon find out there is alot of reading, and the guiding text/objectives are horrible. And omg, the idea of finding these buildings that you activate to (Self spawning heroes) so they can walk around in your dungeon that you decorate and lay down gold for them to look at and take so they can gain points of some sort, which you'll then gain when you kill them.. I compare that to some terrible sims or something.. I am currently stuck in my third map, in which i have looked everywhere to try and complete. Probably been looking for 1.5 hours. The mission says (Do that) and i am like ''Yeah i am trying, but how!? Where!? and why!?'' I even tried finding some playthroughs on youtube, but i have only found videos of Skirmish map playing.. I am done! for now.. I payed for the game, so i may take it up again when i have the patience..			",99,43,0,20,5,0,11

												Dungeons is a simple game, quite reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper. You are the ultimate dungeon lord, dethroned and betrayed by your ex-girlfriend Calypso. You and your faithful servant must work hard in  the evil hierarchy to regain your position as ultimate evil, fighting hero after hero, betraying dungeon master after dungeon master. Quite a fun game, if you are tired of playing the same holier than thou save the world kind of hero.			",213,56,3,26,24,1,35

												I bought this game when it was on sale soley based off the fact I used to love the Dungeon Keeper series and this looked to be a spiritual successor of sorts.  Sadly, it feels and plays like a game that isn't quite finished.  The tutorial explains almost nothing beyond camera movements which would be fine if the game didn't have such a clunky UI that an explanation is almost mandatory to navigate it.  While I'm glad the game tried to work RPG elements in, I think it ended up pulling both the simulation and rpg down. There is fun to be had here, you just really have to work for it past the initial frustrations and some poor design choices.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
