												Got this game just to see if I could run it after reading the reviews. Running Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, find the .exe, right click it->Properties->Compatibility enable compatibility mode, I used Windows 7 and all the XPs, the only thing that matters is check ""Disable desktop composition"" and I had Run as admin dont even know if I have to. But yeah it runs fine.*** Note, you cannot exit the fullscreen and tab back to Windows or it black screens the game this setting ^^^			",10,0,1,5,7,0,5

												-One of the better games of this genre, even better than Heroes in my opinion. -the rest of the game is as beastly as its art. I've lost weeks back in 2006 because of it-I have to mention the visuals again. 10/10 in that department, the soundtrack fits it and the atmosphere in general is great-slow paced to ensure that you have a taste of each unit and game phase.-the epitome of ""Just 1 more turn and I'm taking a break""			",53,9,0,9,4,0,10

												I think this actually was the first PC game that I have ever played (well apart from those pre-installed games on Windows XP like Solitaire). I enjoyed it back in the days. I still do.Disciples II is a turn-based strategy game with beautiful graphics (even for today) and rich storyline. Unlike other turn-based strategy titles like Heroes, the battle system offers a control over individual units instead of stacked units, which I find very convenient. Also the different strategies you can use to complete a map and the rich storyline guarantees that the gameplay does not get repetitive as it is with Heroes of Might and Magic.In Disciples II, you get to choose from five different races (Elves, Humans, Dwarfes, Demons and Undeads) with their own unique agendas and characteristics. Also you can choose one of three classes for yourself as a strategist: Mage (cast spells twice a day), Warlord (restore Health more quickly) or Guildmaster (more resources and actions for the Thief). So when you've completed game with one race/leader class you can try another.This game offers three elements of gaming experience that I value the most: great style, rich storyline and character development/customization. Also, this game rewards exploring and there are plenty of quest maps to try after the campaign mode is complete.What I didn't like about this game however was that you can export only one leader and only five items to the next campaign, so lot of valuable equipment is lost in the process. Also I didn't like that only a particular development branch could be chosen for a unit class instead of them all. Also, the Multiplayer via Directplay does not work anymore. I guess, you need to try external services like GameRanger for that.Nevertheless, Disciples II is a great classic turn-based strategy game. My overall rating is 10/10.p.s. Don't believe other reviews. This game works on Windows 8.1 like a charm. I had some issues with fullscreen on my laptop (I had to choose a lower resolution, otherwise the game won't fit the screen), but with external monitor there are no problems at all.

												Such an amazing game. The Legend! Somewhere close to the HoMM on that turn-based-strategy Olympus. The core features of this game - amazing visuals and simplified strategy part, countless hours of fun!++Visuals - beautiful character arts, cool mobs models, brutal heroes and colorful landscapes - everything perfectly mixed to create an amazing feeling of a magical journey to the land of Elves and Demons! Even in 2k16, this game still looks gorgeous, despite the fact that there is no hi-res (So i would recommend using old square ELT monitor for the better experience)++Soundwork - 10/10 OST, amazing sound effects and what's more important - 11/10 voice over - seriously this game is the best example of how to make the perfect game.+Great campaigns - All the campaigns - humans, demons, undeads, elves or dwarves are equally interesting, and what's more important, you export your hero from one scenario to another, and this feature saved even in a single! or multi!player - means you can take your hero through the countless battles, and complete harder and harder missions over time! Or you can battle your friends over and over again, exporting your best hero, so you will have more and more intense battles every time.+Nonlinear units leveling system - means you can try various strategies with every faction, there is no PERFECT build, you have to find the one that fits you.+Intense hot-seat sessions - such a great party game, you can play with your friends or your girlfriend, a single game can take HOURS to be completely finished, yet you can finish the game pretty quick - once you lose your main army over some stupid mistake for example :0 Some personal suggestions in the end - for a better experience, try to find an old machine to play this gem - this game has its problems on new computers, yet they are fixable - fps issues, screen resolution etc - everything is fixable up to win10.2 - for the better multiplayer experience I would suggest that small mod, that enables leadership 5 on all level 1 heroes (except thieves and other heroes that supposed to have leadership 1) that makes the game more dynamic, faster start and stuff.

												Hi! I am Muzday! Listen: if you haven't played this game so far, you had lost a lot of fun! Okay, not fun but a lot of gothic.  It impregnates every part of this game: from the design of cities till the soundtrack. I can say with certainty that this game has a strange magical atmosphere, it absorbs all your attention and makes you spend several hours in front of your screen per day, ending turns, fighting the battles with their unique style and develop your squads as you want. After you begin playing, you will notice that you are ready to stroke your soldiers like favourite pets if it will make them to beat enemies more precisely! In general, the only thing I can tell about this game is: If you are looking for a classic and unusual strategy game with a wonderful design, gloomy soundtrack, unrepeatable gothic atmosphere and five different playable races, this game is for you and it is worth your attention!P.S.My first review =)			",25,0,0,3,2,1,5

												This game as well as the game previous it are both very good. It is a turn based strategy that has many fun features. The story and lore is actually really good and makes logical sense, so that is also nice. I don't have to much to say about this game, so lets go ahead with the pros and cons list.Pros-Good Story/Lore, I enjoyed playing the campaigns through, and they are all very nice.Difficulty, it isn't to hard playing it on normal, but playing it on hard can be a bit rough.Combat, much like Disciples 1, this game has a unique combat style, somewhat like a turn based. The combat is fun and I don't get the repetative boredom effect after playing this game a lot.Music/Audio, the music is very good, very rememberable.Tutorial, the tutorial is actually pretty good, unlike other games like these. The tutorial doesn't feel intrusive but also provides you the information you need to properly play the game, which is nice.Cons-Graphics, although the game itself is dated, which I understand, some of the graphics themselves don't look very good. I can't say to many bad things about them, they have really good points as well.Repetativeness, the game can be seen as repetative after a while, especially if you are having a hard time getting past a certain stage.Time, the stages actually take quite a bit of time, but I guess that is why they have the save function. One problem I have is I would prefer to start and finish something in one sitting, so this may or may not be a problem for you.Conclusion-Overall, I really enjoy this game. It is similar to the Might&Magic series, but personally I think that Disciples has a much better story. I believe that the lore in video games is almost as important as the game itself, I guess that is the Game Master in me. Anyway, Disciples II: Rise of the Elves is definitely a fun game that I highly recommend.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			",93,38,0,60,31,0,28

												TBS : TBS - Turn Strategy - FantasyTroubleshooting :1. Right click on DisciplesII: Rise of the Elves entry in your library and choose #SteamLaunchOptionSetupUtility2.a) Check Direct 3D optionb)Check Compatibility Modec) Check Strech to Fullscreen (This will get rid of in-game sidebars with art meant to accomodate 640x480 aspect ratio resolution but will distort the art a little)d)Choose best resolution your monitor can support in the list (1280x1024)f) Launch Game - Works perfect here. No mouse cursor lag, sound issues, or anythingAdditional TroubleshootingGame worked without these steps for me but you can try these if you hit a problem : Go to your steam directory- open Steam - Steamapps - common - Disciples II ROTE folder - right click on Disciples II.exe - choose propreties, enable launch as administrator, compatibility for XP service pack 3 and check 16 bit color.If all else fails you could try changing your windows resolution to match the game's resolution before launchingAlso things worth trying if you have issues is disabling steam community feature for this game, turning off UAC, and disabling cloud integrationReview :This will double the amount of Campaign Content from the original game - brand new campaign for elves - empire - undead - clans.Expect the storyline to reach biblical proportions for the grand finale of the classic Disciples GamesMechanically speaking it is the same goodness as Disciples II, nothing was changedI have very fond memory of this title highly recommendable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does not work on Windows 8 and Steam will not refund the money you waste on this.  Workarounds let you into the game but it is unplayable (literally 1 FPS) and it freezes for 10 to 20 seconds at a time.  Can not play past turn 1.I tried contacting the Developer and the response I got was to get a refund from Steam.  But Steam ignores all attempts to contact them about this as if they know there is an issue but dont want to address it.  My friend has a copy of the retail (Boxxed) version and his works fine (but he has Windows 7)In Steam's defense to DO tend to ignore EVERYTHING...  So maybe its not just this game, maybe its just that they dont give a rats rump if they sell us trash that doesnt work and SCAM us out of our money.			",47,23,3,58,23,2,73

												Okay so, I'd like to address a big issue I've seen in a lot of the comments, which is that if you have a Windows 7 that this game will not work for you, that's not true. However: the game may not boot up properly all the time, leaving it just a dark screen and you needing to CTL+ALT+Delete and close the game and try and reopen it again. Alright. The game it's self is a lot of fun, the design and themes make up a lot of the appeal. The gameplay it's self is still very fun if you enjoy turn-based fighting, though it's not terribly unique in the combat area. It's a lot of fun to level up your units and build your structures to choose the path your units level up into. There are 5 races to play, and if you've come across Disciples II: Gallean's Return on here I don't recommend buying that because this game is the same game but with more content and it's the same price. I made the mistake of buying both this game and that game (though thankfully they're cheap games). Edit: The game also comes with an EXTREMELY versatile level editor. You can make your own quests or campaigns and involve advanced AI and events with extremely intricate triggers and it is REALLY easy to do so.			",77,15,0,24,2,0,15

												Note: the review below is about the gameplay itself. Prior to that, I'd like to bring your attention to the issues that I had with running this game on Windows 7. It is working fairly stable now, but only after tinkering around for a while and disabling the sound completely. Everything might work smoothly out-of-the-box, but be aware that it also might not.Whenever I come back to this game, it sucks me in for hours on end. It has this classic quality that makes me completely lose track of time, and if you're interested at all in turned-based strategy games with tactical combat, this is a game for you.Of course the graphics are outdated, but I think it still works pretty well because of its very enjoyable art style. That being said, I don't know what kind of experience you'll have if you didn't play the game during its initial release.In many ways, the game is very similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic series, although the style of the tactical combat is different. The gameplay boils down to: Roaming around the map with your hero and his party, battling orcs, wild animals, dragons and other players' parties in between, while developing your capital and other cities and claiming as much of the terrain for yourself as possible in order to increase resource income.In conclusion: Just play the damn game. It's cheap, it's fun, it's great.			",172,39,2,28,27,2,68

												Elves are interesting to play but don't differ much from the rest of the factions. Unfortunately the biggest issue is still present: this game discourages you from playing more than one character. You can only take one of your heroes to the next mission and because of that you want to get all of the XP for one hero. Most of the time it look like this: you play your main hero for the whole campaign and the rest of you heroes are only thieves and rod planters.			",194,42,4,15,14,3,25

												The Disciples Series was the greatest Turn-based strategy game. Amazing story line from all of the different races and side stories were amazing as well. With amazing gameplay:So I'll start with the positives:- Really good strategy gameplay.- 4 strong races with amazing abilities and units.- Tactical map layouts which ensure difficulty when moving around the world map.- Each class has same characters which are slightly diffierent in someway (immunity to some types of spells or extra damage/armor.and of course the negatives of the game:- The game is outdated and looks like a buggy minecraft server.- Some classes(units) have extremly large immunities such as (immune to weapon and death(by death I mean death spells just to clarify))- The battles aren't as strategic as they should be. They are strategic but like not advanced.- I think the community is dead but I'm not sure.(it probably is by the time anyone reads this.)Just like Disciples 3 this is an amazing strategy game I'd say this one is better once the graphics are improved(but that wont happen due to the oldness and popularity of the game.

												Fantastic HoMM-style turn-based strategy RPG built around Norse mythology marred by some poor game design choices. There's great variety between the races and each has their own campaign, with each faction having a distinct style. The combat is unique and feels like Ogre Battle but this is also one of it's biggest problems; similarly to Ogre Battle, if all of your units in a party die, they are gone forever. Your favorite hero and his units will transfer between missions so this means if one of your super-units dies you can potentially throw the campaign. The terrain control mechanic is a great visual representation of your area control but I find it downplayed in many missions because of a turn limit or boss rush. Hero customization is diverse and has more options than HoMM but they are slower to level up. Although it has aged poorly, this is a great HoMM alternative that is worth checking out if you're a fan of strategy games.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												I love dis game! I used to play it on an old laptop, and see how high of a level I could get my guies agains the very silly easy AI. Now that I am older though I'm starting to wonder if the empire isn't a little broken. They're the only race that has healers, and they can save you the hassle of haveing to have your guies duck into a city every tough engagment. They also don't need to get the temple right at the beging because of that to, so thats 100 or 150 gold saved and a turn you can use to build something else!All in all still a great game, and ya I know so long as the opponet has ONE ranged guy  they're not that bad, it's just sometihng to think about! 10/10 , 100/1000. Best game! Best Game!G8 b8 m8 I r8 8 out of 8! 8-)			",49,5,0,11,13,0,24

												When I was shown this game by someone back in highschool, I never stopped playing it.I have been a Disciples fan for well over 10 years now and I have no intention of stopping.I own the hard copy of Disciples II Gold so I was alittle dissapointed that that version was not on Steam concidering that it is the deffinitive version.  I however was very pleased to find Rise of the Elves avalible.One thing to keep in mind however is it is a bit borked at first, there are forum posts that help fix the issue, otherwise it runs perfectly.This is the most polished game I have ever seen, over a decade of playing and I personally have only ever encountered one bug, and it was purely graphical which was fixed by a simple reinstall (hard disk).  The digital version so far no bug to be seen, so it was potentially a hardware issue from my old potato computer XDThe only Exception is the Seals quest for the Legion, when fighting the first guardian you will be spammed to death with a fire spell, you need to use cheats to get past it alive.Disciples II has aged suprisingly well, for really early 3d graphics and isometric pixle .gifs this game still looks great...ish xD. All the units are recognizable and its easy to see whats going on, although some of the animations are questionable :pMechanicly this game is very well balanced, although the Undead Hords of Mortis are alittle op, but thats why they are fun.Hords:Difficulty to play : MediumDifficulty to level : HardDifficulty to Build : Hard/EasyMax Teir unit Strength: Very StrongFaction Trait: Potentially Strongest end Teir units/Unique passivesAverage Playstyle: Manipulate/Blitz/SupportMountain Clans:Difficulty to play : EasyDifficulty to level : MediumDifficulty to Build : Medium/HardMax Teir unit Strength: Strong/MediumFaction Trait: Strong end Teir units/Variety of specilized unitsAverage Playstyle: Fortify/Brawl/SupportHoly Empire:Difficulty to play : Medium/EasyDifficulty to level : Medium/HardDifficulty to Build : Medium/HardMax Teir unit Strength: StrongFaction Trait: Variety of specilized units/Dedicated HealersAverage Playstyle: Support/OutliveElven Alliance:Difficulty to play : EasyDifficulty to level : MediumDifficulty to Build : MediumMax Teir unit Strength: Strong/MediumFaction Trait: Elemental Healers/Strongest ranged units (go figure)Average Playstyle: Fortify/SnipeLegions of the Dammed:Difficulty to play : HardDifficulty to level : Medium/HardDifficulty to Build : Easy/Medium/HardMax Teir unit Strength: Strong/Medium/Da ♥♥♥♥ is this?Faction Trait: High HP pools/Unique ability based units/Best Direct Offensive UnitsAverage Playstyle: Blitz/ManipulateThe story of this game is also fantastic, the main ""hero"" of this game is actually Bethrezen if you know the lore, kind of an inturesting turn of events to have the Devil archytype character be the actuall good guy in this universe.  All the stories are interconnected and flow very well.I love this game.I would really like to see this game rebuilt in HD since the flop that was Disciples III destroyed the franchise I doubt a Disciples IV will ever come to pass.

												DON'T BUY IT, DOESN'T WORK ON WINDOWS 7!I'm really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Steam released such a Win-7 incompatible sh*t and asked money for it. Since I bought it I managed to start the game twice in total with sound and all and once it's running it runs without a problem, but each time I spent about 15 minutes trying to start the g*ddamn game before I succeeded, without any sign why a configuration that worked once doesn't work the next time I try it. There doesn't seem to be any logic behind what arbitrary settings finally make the game work for that one single try. I would seriously demand a refund (if Steam did refunds) for selling a product that just simply doesn't bloody work 95% of the time. The game itself is very good, but now I regret that I didn't buy it on GOG instead of Steam...--Update after many months of playing the GOG version: The game itself is excellent and I really recommend it if your system is not Win7 (or if they solved that error in the meantime, I haven't checked).

												While there are tons of reviews on the web about this game (its an amazing strategy game), I wont delve to much into it. My main revew here is to say the game works flawlessly on Win 7 64bit Quad core system. So all the post saying it does not, I have to yeild to user error. While I have the non-steam version, for $1.62 i bought the steam version and it worked fine. Game was smooth, I got my butt kicked prompty by some lame♥♥♥♥♥zombies - who would have thunk for turn one LOL!!!So do not listen to all.. it works on win 7 out of the box.			",192,104,3,100,49,1,31

												While after a couple hours I began to appreciate this game after an initially bad impression..........its just not quite as good as Heroes 3-5, and those games in turn are not quite as good as Age of Wonders 3.  Naturally thats not a completely fair reason to denegrate this game due to differences in age and the limitations that come with that.........but I bought it originally looking for an alternative to Heroes 5 and didn't find it more fun.  Im sure in its day this was one of the best examples of this style of game..........but today you should seriously just get Age of Wonders 3.  This game will forever sit around as 10 dollars I wish I could now put toward something else.  Its not bad, theres just better options now.			",93,26,2,18,13,0,41

Hitting ESC brought up a prompt asking if I wanted to close the current game. However I couldn't say yes, because I couldn't click anything and no there was no hotkey I could find. Windows Key + D brought up the Windows taskbar, but wouldn't minimize the game. I could open the task manager with Shift + CTRL + ESC. But I couldn't see it, because the game refused to minimize. I had to right click the task manager icon in the system tray and select Always On Top. This brought the task manager to the forefront so I could make the game forcefully close.10/10 had a blast			",121,35,0,28,7,0,22

												I wish I could give a review based on actual gameplay but just navigating through menus feels like trying to wade through hardening cement.  To say that there's a bit of control lag would be a huge understatement.  I move my mouse and five seconds later the cursor catches up.  Uninstalling.			",464,137,28,69,83,9,96

												This game was one of my first childhood games which has risen throughout the years to become one of my favourite titles of all time. Let's start off back in the years of 2003/2004 where my brother aquired this game through a friend, he, along with myself, started playing the game on one of our old CPU's in our house. We rarley tried multiplayer and instead relied soley on the singleplayer campaign where I cheated extensivly at first (stairwaytoheaven is one of the best cheats ever thank you stratagy first) however after a while I started to play the game fully. I kept playing the game and over a few years our computers upgraded and eventually the game didnt become compatible anymore. I was unaware of the wide variety of questions I ask google at this time so I wrote it off as losing one of my fave games of all time. Years later I am playing this game, on steam, on my windows 8 laptop and it is still as amazing as it ever was.Lets start off with the fact that this is a standalone expansion pack, it does not require the normal game to play.Is this better than the original? well, it contains everything the original has and more so i'd say yes.This game allows you to play as 5 different races with unique units, buildings and combat styles. Dwarves are slow but powerful and require you to be able to take hits before you can deal them out, the undead are frail but do great damage to opposing units and are able to paralyze individual units almost crippling entire armies, the human empire is fast and furious but fairly frail and require constant healing to stay alive. Each of them has a unique campaign and each of them are great in thier own way (go dwarves though). I could go on about how smoothly the gameplay runs, how the spell sytem works and how the variation of upgrades allows me to replay the game hundreds of times. But, instead I will ask you, as a favour to me, buy this game, it is amazing. They did sort of screw up the 3rd game in the series but the 1st and second, and especially this stand-alone expansion are amazing games, and you should get it!			",99,11,0,14,13,2,20

												Disciples II continues the Disciples II saga. The changes are just what you would expect. A new campaign playing as the elves with the appropriate capital, buildings, units and spells. If you haven't played a Disciples game before I highly recommend playing Sacred Lands and Disciples II first as it will give you greater context for the world and the races in it. If you have played the other games you know what to expect already. Disciples II: Rise of the Elves doesn't do anything particularly new but expands on an already solid formula. Richly detailed artwork and music help to immerse you in a dark fantasy world. If you are a Disciples fan this is a worthwhile addition to the series and one that ultimately gives you more of what you love.			",85,9,0,9,7,0,16

												The game is awesome! There was an issue with running the game initially, it turns out that I had to go in to the properties for three of the applications. All I had to do was set the compatibility settings to automatically run them in windows 8 service pack 2. Though something I would like to note as that you probably shouldn't bother asking steam for support with the crashing. I tried asking for help with it, specifically it would always crash after installing it the first time. But anyways I messaged them and they took more than two weeks to respond!! Two weeks!! And the worst part is that when they finally respond they literally just give the same info given by the website, to verify the integrity of the game. I always thought that steam offered good customer support but apparently I was wrong. It's cool they offer these older games, jt sucks that they have bad customer support. I'll be sure to remember this. Anyways aside from that, the game is awesome!! I definitely would recommend it if you like these classic turn based type strategy games!!			",4,0,0,5,0,0,9

												The best and ending chapter of the epic Disciples II saga, probably the best turn-based strategy game ever released. As the title suggests, the campaign focuses on the newly introduced faction of the Elves, aided by their centaur allies. Which side will you choose to further the interests of the Elves? The Noble Elves or the Wild Elves?Regardless of your choice in troops, you'll be fighting epic battles against very powerful enemies that will trully test your skills.The graphics are mostly 2D, and while most of you will take that as a very bad sign, trust me when I say that the artistic style and attention to each and every line makes this a very good looking game still.The music is breathtaking and sound is overall very well made. Make no mistake, the atmosphere is dark and gloomy, but also glorious and uplifting.Make sure you get Disciples II Gold Edition which includes the original game as well as all the (three) expansion packs.
