												NO HD version, NO new freatures, NO achievements or card drops, JUST nostalgia and one of the best strategy games ever made.beautyfull graphics and an awesome gameplay, start with 10 worker units and finish it with a 700 man strong army.you can WIN with MASS OR CLASS, you can send over 1000 units but they can weaker as 400 fully upgradet units.to bring it on the point, when you LIKE GOOD strategy games, you do NOTHING, NOTHING wrong with it.EDIT: for me it runs perfectly on win7, i played it with a friend (LAN) and we had no problem, he used win8 and yeah the first time he had many crashes but we found the problem (start the game through the exe in the steam folders .

												I still remember when I got the game, it was an accident...My friend gave me a demo cd with a bunch of games on it and cossacks: back to war was one of em.I kept play that one demo mission again and again...I think STILL this is the best strategy game of all time, it amazes me how you can control thousands, big cities and navy fleets.And it takes hundreds of hours to finish the game because there is so much missions in it and of course an editor too.And this strategy game is unique because the game mechanics are so different than most of the other strategy games, you dont have to rush for resources, there is always a few mine places around you where you can get the resources from.But it takes a long time to upgrade yourself and meanwhile you have to defend yourself too and thats why almost all of the missions takes 2-3 hours to finish, so this makes you feel like you are in a real hardcore war I think.I had so much epic battles in this game			",18,0,0,2,0,1,2

												It was one of my first computer games and it's still one of my favorites!-Amazing battles-Many possible strategies : mortars to attack from a huge distance, cavalry to attack the rearguard or to quickly pillage mines, officers and drums to make troop formations (up to 196 soldiers with one officer)...-Enormous battlegrounds filled with soldiers (up to 10 000 if I remember correctly)!-A lot of available countries with different architectures and troops-Possibility to capture citizens, artillery and buildings with only some simple soldiers (there are priests too but they can heal a bit)-Interesting use of ressources (to be able to fire you need coal, to keep mercenaries on your side you need gold etc.) so if your coal mines get captured for example you can no longer fire anything! (of course you can buy coal on the market but the prices can vary a lot depending on your behavior)-Pretty good soundtracksIt's often really cheap on sales so if you enjoy RTS games, grab it!

												I've been playing Cossacks for 13 years and I can say that it's the best rts I've played.Pros:-Extensive economy-Massive battles (at land and sea)-Various strategies for winning, depending on circumstances,terrain and your nation's and opponents' features.-Buildings are exact replicas of real ones all over Europe-100 single missions-9 campaigns-Taking advantage of the terrain is my favourite aspect of this game.You can place artillery on high ground,musketeers on either side of a passage for ambush,build walls and towers on strategic positions, block bridges  etc. Cons:-Apart from a couple of minor bugs,none whatsoever.I tried playing age of empires and empire earth,after having played cossacks for a time,and I just couldn't! They are, definitely,inferior games. ",122,36,0,23,5,0,40

												Incredibly good game. Been playing this for over 10 years with a friend and we're still impressed by it.-The game has an excellent balance between different unit types.-The nations are varied enough to keep it enjoyable for a long time. Some nations may be very slightly over powered though e.g. Poland and Ukraine-Seemingly endless single missions and enjoyable campaign.-Art style is good and will likely age very well over time.-Good resource ideas.-Good upgrade trees-One downsides is poor AI, which uses the same tactics constantly, just with increasingly larger numbers of units.-The blue and black team colors are difficult to see on the map sometimes, while the white color is easily confused with the unit selected color on the map.-The mine locator upgrade obsures your mines on the map making them difficult to locate ironically.-No options for reforging alliances after the game has started.-Multiplayer over internet is difficult to set up initially			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reasons to get this game:Very light, would run on a toaster if necessaryBIG battles. Battles of 1000+ vs 1000+ (and way way bigger) are possible if you so desire, easy system to make your soldiers in to ""squads"" so managing those 1000+ soldiers is not very hardActually has LARGE maps. Compared to, for example, AoE III, their ""large"" map is small compared to cossacks very large.I have not played the campaign very much but from what I have, it seems pretty solid and challenging.Has map editor that's pretty easy to use!Also one cool thing I must add is how every single unit you have, be thousands or more keep their own record for their kills. You can see every single soldiers killcount separately, pretty cool. This is also true for cannons, towers and ships.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have played this game since 2004 but off Steam. i've played Command & Conquer, Rise of Legends, Age of Empires, Starcraft, etc. a lot of RTS games. yet i keep coming back to this beautiful masterpiece.pretty much all the negative reviews on this game are people that arent able to play it because they're too n00b and dumb and switched to Windows 8 or 10.

												Lets Fight in the 17th and 18th Century with Cossacks:Back to War.This statergy game is like mix of Total War and Age of Empires,though there are some pros and cons in the game,which are written as follow: Pros:  Great Game,good graphics of its time Huge battles,good AI,Lengthy Campaigns. Huge choice of nations,and units.I can only mention the above,thier are alot of pros in this game. Cons:  No Unit Voice. Very hard campaigns, cannot be really completed by everyone. No message of telling that resources are low, unit has been created,unit is idle,or no downward toolwarThis is a great game,these cons are the only ones i could find,though as i said above,the single player missions and the game campaigns are very very hard even on normal mode,and lengthy too. Only a true statergy player can play and like this game.			",11,0,0,0,1,0,2

												One of the best strategy games out there. Spend hundreds of hours playing this game back when it just came out (ahh... nostalgia). Some campaign missions are insanely hard, even on normal difficulty, unlike most 'modern' strategy games in which you can usually beat the entire campaign without real effort (which is rather boring, I like having hard missions!). You can actually have huge scale battles on land or on sea in this game with thousands of units. Every battle will be unique because of all the different nations you can choose to play.TL;DRI only have one piece of advice: stop reading reviews. This game costs just 5 euros (or even less when its on sale). Buy it. Now.			",55,7,0,3,3,0,24

												Cossacks Back to War is one of the best RTS games of all time and my personal favorite by far. It was created more than a decade ago but is still played and enjoyed by many people. If they had servers up and running for it many more people would still be playing it. COSSACKS 3 IS COMING OUT THIS FALL! They are planning on basing it off this original version of cossacks, keeping it a full priced game (a good thing), and it will be modding friendly. Way to go Cossacks 3 developers!

												Best RTS game ever.  I used to play this game a lot in my youth.  The best thing about it, is you have no limit on how many troops you can create!  You just need to have enough resources and dwellings, as long as you have enough, you can create as big of an army as you want.  For those of you complaining about this game not working on Windows 10Here is how to make it work (and stop crashing):1. Go to your steam library, right click on ""Cossacks: Back to War"" and select ""Properties""2. In ""Properties"", go to the ""Local Files"" tab, and select ""Browse Local Files""3. Open the ""bin"" folder, then scroll down & find ""csbtw"" right click it & select ""troubleshoot compatibility""4. After a moment you should get to a screen where you can select ""Try Recommended Settings""5. Once you have selected it, you can click on ""Test the Program"" to do a test run of the game, then exit the game6. Now select ""Next""  and then ""Yes, save these settings for this program"" it will then try to detect other issues7. After this, it should say that it is fixed, click on ""Close""There you have it!  The game should now run fine without crashing on you, and you can change the game speed without problems. My only issue now is getting it to display in widescreen, other than that, it runs perfectly.  I found the above steps in a youtube video, and it worked.  I hope this helps.			",11,2,0,9,2,0,2

												A timeless classic. It has all the usual features that RTS games of that time tended to have.. and more!Here are some features that make this game especially awesome and which many contemporaries lack (e.g. AoE, Warcraft, C&C):- automatic infinite production loops of units (so you don't click yourself to death trying to constantly refill the ranks of your troops)- armies CAN get huge (easily over 1,000+ per player) and WILL get huge (due to the ease of producing lots of units)- more realism: your swordfighters won't be able to hit a building with melee weapons magically setting it on fire and eventually destroying it, instead, most buildings can be captured, and buildings can be destroyed only using artillery or certain specific unit types (standard settings)- very flexible game speed (single player only): you can play it really slow to follow every single move your units make, useful when building up a base, or insanely fast to the point where you'll have trouble keeping up with understanding whats going on during a battle			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for keeping it alive but i have a question....WHY YOU DONT MAKE A NEW COSSACKS WITH THE CURRENT GAME MECHANICS AND GRAPHICS ETC??We all miss the ""old style"" RTS with base building, turtle style, economics army etc. You see that there are people that still buying a 16 years old game (not the cossacks 2) so why you dont start making a new one? even a cossacks HD or something ith more camera view, better graphics etc etc. You will have our support for sure			",48,7,0,4,13,1,15

One of the best strategy game made in early 2000s,.Not like other strategy games you can build huge armies.Not like other strategy games you can play same game for days.You can play with lots of different options and nation. You can also create your maps or missionsInteresting solo missions, campaign,  and customized games.Totally worth it.  And it's really cheap!!			",112,9,4,7,8,1,16

												Classic RTS. Consists of fast or slow paced civilization building with unique nations, you can control thousands of units at any moment, and the game features a realistic--and equally unforgiving--resource/economy system not seen in many RTSs.During its prime the game looked quite beautiful, and while I can't confirm you can play multiplayer with your friends, the single-player campaign is quite challenging and you will face challenging overwhelming forces more often than not. It's quite cheap on Steam, and you will find a lot of value for your dollar. Edited - 6/10/15			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Couldn't tell you whether to get this or any of the other from the original Cossack(tm) series. Most of them say this, and I own them all on GOG.com.At any rate, I can't recommend this enough! If you're a history buff like me, and/or fan of strategy games then you're bound to like this. There are not many, and especially well made, pike and shot games out there. Believe me, this is one of the few fantastic ones. And for the price it's hard to beat. There are some 20 nations to choose from, each unique with advantages and disadvantages, and each offer different challenges and opportunities.Just how a strategy game should play. Just buy it, I doubt you'll regret it! ",94,5,1,8,3,0,14

												This is one the best stradegy games I have ever played. Everything about this game makes you think of your economy versus your army. However, most of the game focuses on your military and navy. This is the best in the Cossacks series and the only one you need. Each nation is matched as they would be in the 1600 to 1700s. So late is better to go with a strong nation from that time. So not the middle eastern countries, but they are very stronge in the early part of the game. It is Napolionic fighting and is very addictive. This is very recommened to anyone who like RTS's. It will become a favorite, when you see 3000 of your troops attack a city.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh, dear when you start playing this game time flies.This one of the best strategy games I have ever played. I still remember back in the day when I spent hours and hours playing this as a kid and still this game is pretty fun to play with friends. Also there are awesome historic battles where you can lose yourself.Sadly for campaign you need to buy DLC, but it's pretty cheap.So do I recommend this game? Ofcourse, It's one of the best strategy games out there. Don't waste your time on Cossacks 2 and 3, they are awful.			",296,65,12,26,25,7,26

												Many of you may be asking whether this is a game worth picking up. Some of you may be turned off by the graphics but believe me, this is one heck of a fun game to play. I'm a person who will try any game no matter how old the graphics as long as its is addicting and fun to play.Actually, this one of my favorite RTS Games of all time. With tons of nations to choose from each with their own distinct characteristics, it will definitely keep you playing for hours end on end fielding gigantic armies and swift yet powerful navies to throw at your enemies. I recently bought this game here in Steam just to get a secure copy of the game because mu old CD is now broke. I've probably sunk hundreds or perhaps more than a thousand hours into this game since I started playing it 8 years ago and I still enjoy it today! If you don't mind the look of the graphics and want a great strategy game to sink your teeth into, you should definitely try Cossacks: Back to War (^_^)			",137,18,0,24,11,1,26

												Hardest and olders strategy game I have so far owned.I have not passed a single campaign in this game and only 1-3 missions per campaigns.It's custom battles are also difficult and managing insane amounts of resources that get drained at the speed of lights because of your mercenaries and walls.I may just lack the required skill and mind but seriously this game is very very hard.Like the odds that are againts you are more then often insane.Won't work on every computer due to it's age but if it does it should be fun.You can always cheat or mod or just play custom battles with AI on your side but ye definitely hard, definitely rewarding when and if you win and definitely fun to play in my opinion.

												One of those games where I got the most fun.Start with a couple peasants around 17th century - build houses,buildings,town halls, barracks, maintain your resources and generate a whole city! Create an army to destroy the enemy city, choose your own nation in the lobby or also choose which players are allied or enemy (without internet, it's player vs bots and player can choose to ally with anyone).I mean, what can not be more fun than create a city, destroy enemy's city, and build even more city on the dust of the destroyed enemy city? You can build out to a world leader! but then you get a victory message, unless some random superheroe comes out of nowhere and kicks your whole nation.			",59,6,0,2,5,1,5

												Got this in Cossacks and American Conquest Pack. Paradox is, cossacks 1 is the only game, in that pack, that works, its also the oldest one, this makes it even more puzzling. Its also most entertaining and most accessible to new players. There is not much to it. Just build economy a spam as much units as you can feed and arm, then butchery can start. Surprisingly, naval battles are fun to watch. Something, i thought, i will never see in strategy game.Its good game. Just dont buy it in pack with AC and cossacks 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cossacks Back to War is a very old RTS that focuses on building huge armies of 10.000+ units per player with tactical 18th century combat using variety of canons,upgrades and naval warfare . You can use generals to build formations that give melee bonuses, use cavalry for flanks (which is actually very effective ) and canons for long range siege .In its own right this is one of the best game in the genre . Since all units and buildings are made in sprites rather than 3d models this game still looks pretty good .Go to options and reduce game speed when you playing single player ;)I don't get to say this very often but UKRAINE and DENMARK OP			",266,102,5,39,11,1,38

												This one's a bit different from cossacks 2.  It is a lot more like Age of the Empires in the sense of gameplay.  It takes place in the Napoleonic Wars.  I believe Age of the Empires 3 ripped off this game, and put a lower unit cap.  My attachement to the game is the scope.  You control squads of 196 men (At least I do).  That is a lot for a game like age of the empires.  A comparable game series would be Stronghold.  I checked, and the global unit cap is none.  WOW.  So yeah, feel free to use your math to figure out how many is too many and crashes the computer.  I also must mention the imperium mod here.  I adds the 19th century, and balances a few things.  Of note is that there is diplomacy, and other things.  Also, the upgrade system is pretty extensive.  You will NEVER research everything.  Well, unless you play defensive the whole game, and stall your opponent until that point.  I do that in Cossacks 2 to my friend.  :POh yeah, I've played Age of the Empires 3, and this game is EASILY superior.			",60,5,1,15,26,0,75

												Though my hours are few I plan on adding many more, all I can say is this game is right up my alley and as a fan of history (specficially Protestant Prussia) I whole heartily approve of this game with some caveats:The common cry among the negatives reveiw is that it is not optimized for modern computers and that is true, was not the case for me but a common warning nevertheless.It is quite different from modern RTS, wheras modern RTS have since had their shift focused more on the combat and less on the economy (or reducing it to 2-3 resources) this game I find is a balance, you need a good economy to make a good military which unlike most modern RTS is set in the 17th-18th century.Gameplay wise, while every nation has roughly identical units (to a greater or lesser degree, some nations have completely unique and distinct units) their sprites are distinct for each nation, culture and people (hell, you can set wars between Prussia and Bavaria in what was once vestige states of the ""Holy"" Roman Catholic Empire, 100 points to Martin Luther for smashing that to peices).I highly recacomend this game, doubly so if you computer has Windows XP virtual drive.

												Dear Gamer,Cossacks Back To War is in my opinion one of the best colonial- and build-your-army game. You can choose a imperium, which was in the 17th and 18th century popular, like Prussia, Great Britan or Bavaria. Be careful, because it's a very old game, which released in 2002, but the feeling is unforgattable.Marcel			",5,0,1,0,5,0,8

If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat.			",58,3,2,6,3,1,2

												Seriously, buy this game. Its dirt cheap and absolutely FANTASTIC you CAN play it on multiplayer using Hamachi or Evolve (works better) and if you get MOD1 then this becomes an even bigger gem. If looking for people to play with I am ALWAYS up for a computer match or a player vs player (even though I am not that good). I recommend it more than I can possibly recommend any other game I have ever bought.If looking for the link to MOD1 or how to install if feel free to add me if you like and I would be more than happy to assist you in downloading it and even teaching you the basics or even advanced moves!

												The game is (was) good, if you can get it to work properly. For me, it was flickering at a sickening speed, making the game absolutely unplayeable because there's no way that it won't hurt one's eye.If you happen to buy this, be aware that you have the option to refund a game if bought from Steam Store (activation code from 3rd parties doesn't count)			",970,514,12,137,64,4,122

												I bought the game years ago, but with the latest window version it was difficult to play the game.Using the steam version all troubles of the old gameseems to be solved. The colorchange within win7 is solved (normally patched by closing explorer.exe). This version is compatible with windows8. But most of all I pleased to see that when playing LAN with 4 players you don't need to press alt-tab to keep the loading of a map progressing.Very pleased with this version of cossacks!!

												As steam probably shows I don't have very many hours on this game, but I have played american conquest which was released 2 years after this game. it is almost an exact replica with very minor gameplay changes and different nations, other than that just higher terrain detail and graphics quality.The whole system with buildings, upgrades, etc. is basically the same and I think both of these games are equally good because they are not exactly the same so it just depends on what you want to play at the time, but after playing American Conquest I can't play age of empires with my friends without wanting to play specific game modes (other than a simple random map match) similar to the gameplay of AC.Would definitely recommend anyone who loves RTS to play the Cossacks/American conquest games and looking forward to Cossacks 3 coming out some time soon.

Die Grafik ist zwar nicht mehr die beste (gut war sie damals schon auch nicht), aber hey, man kann tausende von Soldaten oder hundert Schiffe auf dem Bildschirm versammeln, die den Begriff ""Armee"" oder ""Flotte"" wirklich verdient. Die Kampagnen der einzelnen Länder sind geschichtlich auch recht interessant, weil man die meisten aus dem Unterricht eher nicht kennt.

												Was one of the best RTS for me. I like the fact that you can make (almost) unlimited units if you can pay for housing. ALs the unlimited supply of every resource is somewhat unique in this genre. The game just feels right and the computer gives you a tough challenge until you master the game. The AI can't deal with peace time though. I would only recommend this game for single player, as multiplayer can be a pain in the butt. I've had problems even connecting for LAN games with my friends and if you lose connection for more than 10 seconds during a game, you are defeated and there's nothing you can do about it.
