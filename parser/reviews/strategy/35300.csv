												Underrated little gem of a RTS/ Tactics Game.Like Military Real Time Tactical but sick of fighting WWII for the 50th time? Good modern warfare RTTs like World in Conflict/ Wargame only happen every few years so if you like those games check this out. A good compromise between realism and fun. Unit promotion system and basic economy system to reward keeping units alive for multiple mission. Pre / Post mission unit management similar to a very simplified Theatre of War interface but without the frusturating soldier by soldier search through a platoon for a good gunner or driver. Graphics on par with Command and Conquer Generals, which was good for the time. A lot more unit and ammo options for individual units but that is to be expected in a good Tatical Game. Unit salvage a good element that adds to the gameplay. Soundtrack good for the budget as well. I have heard Nvidia graphics users have had problems but this game is old enough to run fine on the CPU graphics amd and intel have. Real shame there is no demo for this game as most would be understandably reluctant to retail purchase a game from an unknown franchsise and developer that was under the radar from the day it was released. I might humbly suggest a certain bundle website.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finished it in about 20hours.What a ride, one of the best RTS I've played. I specially like the attention to detail. Like having the back door of the APCs open when you are disembarking infantry, or vault animations when they are jumping over a wall. The firefights feel like actual combat and can take a long time, not like company of heroes where its over in seconds. You need to watch for your units ammo and make sure they dont run out. Units that survive one mission will gain veterancy and you can use them on the next one. Definitely a hidden gem and I wish more people knew about this game. The only downside is that there is no skirmish or multiplayer which would have been an amazing addition.Play it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a gem under mud. At first glance I thought it's just low class game but I wrong about it. I have to admit that this game is fun. It's like Red Alert but require more strategies and tactics. Do not underestimate low price game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RTS Strategy games set in modern times. The game can be quite hard on the Normal difficulty, but only when you make mistakes. Rush in all your forces into an enemy encampment for example! Then you will find it hard to complete certain missions. Though taking it easy, planning your plan of attack.Also like others have said you can spend hours on it and it is true so take your time and enjoy it.This is a must have game for RTS fans and I do recommend it.

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  WarfareDeveloper:  GFI RussiaPublisher:  Game Factory InteractiveGenre:  Real Time StrategyGeneral ImpressionWarfare really looks the part, considering it’s a strategy title launched in late 2008. A game I never played until now and as a major fan of strategic games, I must say that I’m pleased with what I’m seeing. It’s an RTS focusing solely on the Middle East front, unfortunately still a very active war theatre today. I really enjoyed the RPG elements such as, troops gaining combat experience and the effect morale has on the enemy forces. I especially salute the difficulty of the title which despite some AI pathfinding issues is still proving a worthy challenge. Even without any Achivements or Cards, this underrated RTS is still a nice addition to any strategy fan’s collection.Strong Points+ Good looking  graphics that have aged well.+ Mission and unit diversity.Weak Points- No Steam Trading Cards or Achievements.- Erratic AI behavior.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

												I think that Warfare is the best creation of GFI. Unfortunately, not all the ideas were implemented, but for me it is still a pleasure to play. Among the few drawbacks I would note the need for old version of PhysX (cards GeForce 2nd serie for example) and overextendness of some missions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's great to encounter such an underrated gem!Warfare is a slow paced RTS that tends to be realistic. The game throws you into a solo campaign (no skirmish) in Saudi Arabia in a fictional scenario where you play the US forces. Its graphics are good considered its age, no bugs so far (except that physX thing i've read).What makes this game good is its small details, units responses are coherent (especially loving that ""Sir?"" when they got pinned and kindly asking WTH are you waiting for?) and immersive. The emails between mission reflects a great thinking for the ""war"" topic, seeing a patriotic american slowly loosing faith in a senseless war. There is also a nice soundtrack but sound effects could get a buff and voice acting is terrible.Even if content sounds light with only a solo campaign, it should keep you busy for at least a dozen hours, a mission can take more than an hour.Really consider Warfare if in need of some modern tactical RTS!

												Surprisingly good RTS,pausable Realtime,Modern Setting (Apache Gunships, Atgms, Humvees)Line of Sight Rules.Limited Ammo,Inf  can occupy buildings and abandoned Vehicles , quite realistic Weapon behaviour (Range/Damage).Units and Vehicle Crews get Experience and can be transfered between Missions.No Base Building, Reinforcements from outside of the Map on certain Events.New Units can be bought into your Army Reserves from earned points .for Example, after reaching a Map objective you can select 1 Tank  1 Helicopter 5 Infantry from you Army Reserves to enter the Map.Needed a Physx Legacy Patch to run on Win 7, except for that runs flawless.If i had to compare it to to other RTS i would say its somewhere between Men of War and Command and Conquer.

												Feels like Blitzkrieg with a modern warfare facelift... interface is clunky, limited zoom levels, no keyboard scrolling (mouse edge only), units don't move as you expect (all on foot units stop moving with anything in range, can't capture enemy BMP even though the text suggested that you could, primary Bradley ran out of fuel before even reaching objective... and that's just the FIRST battle which makes no sense.UPDATE: turns out you have to use a vehicle crew to capture another vehicle. Dumped the Bradley for the BMP1 then proceed to clear the route and managed to finish the first mission despite a tank killed almost everybody except that one BMP. This wasn't explained close to well enough in the manual. There's a gem somewhere hidden under there, but it's kinda hard to find. I guess if you got tired of the typical RTS you can give this one a try, but I find Wargame series to be better.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												""Saudi Arabia, one of the world's leading oil suppliers and a key U.S. ally, has been taken over by a highly organized group of radical terrorists. The government is in a state of collapse and turmoil and you have been chosen to lead the United States' armed forces to restore control.""LOL the saudi banks fund or channel money to most of the terrorists, or at least the ones that the US and Russia don't .. so I find the premis a bit silly.But lets give it a go ... 20 min later I have to tap out.Pro:It's not a bad military strategy game for a technical point of viewLow system specs neededAt least it's not yet another WW1/2 RTS gameFor a russian game it doesn't suck ... seriously most of their games really really SUCK. So +1 GFI Russia!Con:Driver issuesStupid storylineThe voice acting is ... I'm not even going thereIt's RTS and I am a turn based fan. I dislike RT to say the leastThere are other games in this genre that are just better at what they do.$20? Ummmmmmmm, seriously?  This is a $5 game unless you NEED another RTS.Overall:Not bad, just not good.  If you can get this cheap buy it. Seriosuly if your into RTS you should be able to get $10+ worth of fun out of it. If your into strategy games wait till it's $5 or less (better yet free in a bundle).So the tough part ... thumbs up or down.Thumbs up ... if you can get it cheap. Part of this is a thumbs up for GFI, a russian game company that doesn't make complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥should be supported.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
