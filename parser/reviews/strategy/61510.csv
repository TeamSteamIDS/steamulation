												If you don't mind outdated games definitely play this and Shadow Magic, the Age of Wonders games are the best of this type of strategy game, much better than any heroes of might and magic game or even Civ despite the fact that they've been continuing to release content while Age of Wonders hasn't for over 10 years (Age of Wonders 3 is now in developement though). It has a hex tile map with turn based movement and a battle mode that takes you into a seperate map like in heroes of might and magic but much MUCH better, it even takes into account unit fatigue, morale, experience and the angle and distance at which they attack (obstacles like walls and rocks you have to shoot over reduce chances of projectiles hitting). Sidenote: For anyone having crash issues, this is an old game, disable direct 3d and directsound to eliminate crashing, run on compatibility mode if it makes you feel any better. You can set resolution all the way up, the main menu and the intro video will still be tiny for some reason but once you're actually in game everything will be the right size.

												This game is one of the best of it's genre I have played. You should definatley buy it if your into turn based strategy games.  It has a good storyline to it that will keep you into the game for long sessions. And if you get bored with that then there's skirmish mode to indulge in.The actual gameplay, though quite challenging, is really good. You can choose a start race from a wide range of fantasy races, and you don't even have to stick with them! You can change to some other race, or even be both, or all three, or all of them if you have enough diplomatic might to prevent them from squabbling.All in all, this is a really great game.

												If like me you enjoy a classic turn based rpg strategy, this may be the game for you.. upon playing this against the NPC you'll soon discover even on the easiest difficulty the bots will give you a hard time, this has a slight learning curve but once you get to grips with the game and can survive 100 turns, you'll be engrossed in the game and with each turn! How you play is entirely up to you, use diplomacy to your advantage..how about tradeing? maybe bribe? Or just annihalate anyone with a army of your choice. Good game overall, and fun to play i rate 7.5/10			",117,8,1,23,6,0,27

												There’s a big list of spells, many details to track, loads of different units to recruit, train, and summon, a good level of challenge, an interface that doesn’t get in the way of playing the game, and a very intriguing end-game sequence. It's one of those games you can start playing one evening, and then the next time you look up it's three in the morning. With beautiful graphics, a smart AI, and a dragon’s hoard of replayability, Age of Wonders II is a winner. Truly, A phenomenal game.			",119,51,1,44,29,2,55

												If you're not familiar with this game, but not driven off by its outdated graphics, then all you really need to know is that this game is kind of like a turn-based strategy game with a heavy focus on fantasy. The progression comes from producing new buildings or constructing new cities to aid in farming more resources. There is a sort of RPG-ish mechanic, based on your Mage who is essentially your starting hero unit and best hero unit, as you can cast spells and summon creatures or research new ones. Then if you're up for it one of the unique features is that the combat can be handled manually in a turn-based tactics arena. If you like fantasy, magic and strategy then you'll enjoy this game.

												The AI can see everything on the map.  This means your scout unit will get ambushed and killed while you're trying to get the map revealed.  It also means the AI will quickly move in to take an undefended city.  This means that taking risky gambles will also never pay off, and it slows everything down as you'll either be producing throw away scouts or exploring with an armies.			",7,1,0,11,2,0,13

												Loved this game years ago. Finaly bought it on steam because good turn based strategy games are hard to comeby these days. I recommend this game only if you are okay with playing in windowed mode as there is no option for fullscreen. I have not played a match on steam yet, mostly because I hate playing in windowed mode so I have no information on actual game play. Warning for those wanted to play multiplay: when I played this game years ago it had terrible issues with desynchronizing and crashing. Just a heads up.To be perfectly honest I will probably never launch this game again since AoW3 is out. I own this game out of nostalgia, so I cannot recommend this to nonAoW / TBS fans.

												This is a classic turn-based strategy, and I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately there are some compatiblity issues that made the game difficult to play, and sadly it hasn't aged well. I enjoyed trying the game out, but some issues - like the text on info windows displaying gibberish - made it very difficult. Also, during combat sequences there are scaling and panning issues that make it impossible to properly view the battlefield.It's a shame, because in this game's day I'm sure it was a top tier turn based game! A lot of newer games have come out since then that look, sound and play better. I didn't get to experience a lot of this game because the compatibility issues prevented me from getting very far. I may give it another shot at another time, but I think it is probably better to just wait for AoW 3.  For the time being, I would not recommend it simply because it will not run properly on modern pcs. However, if you have an older or weaker pc and want to play an RTS that can run on your machine this one might be a good choice. I think that for now I would prefer Elven Legacy if I want to play this sort of game.			",206,24,0,50,8,1,22

I guess Merlin isn't as smart as they say he is if he couldn't even keep the easiest skills and had to relearn everything 6 times and still forget on the last level. Pretty interesting ending though.

												I have to say this is an excellent turn based strategy game that will tax the limits of your mind. It is also however long winded. The campaign... each battle actually takes a good five or so hours, so be ready to put this game down. Unless you don't have a life. Since its turn based, its great while doing other things too while playing it like watching TV Or chatting.			",351,98,0,69,42,3,67

												Just as epic as i remember it.  Bought it on Steam just for memory sake and am loving it.  By far one of my top favorite strategy turn-based games.  Reminds me a lot of Heroscape, but massive proportion.Pros:-Massive replay value.-Several races, each race having their own large set of creatures and spells, pros and cons.-Map creator.-You're free to play how you want to play and have your own strategy, regardless of whether or not it actually works.  Parties dont have to have heroes.  And besides the alignment penalty, you are free to mix, match and group any units you want in a party.-AI is actually intellegent.  Very little foresight but AI characters usually dont make blatantly stupid mistakes.-""Board-View"" zooms in to ""Battle-View"" when fighting.  It is still turn based and can be manually controlled, auto-pilot, or skipped all together if you're not one for battle strategy (... but then you probably wouldn't be playing this, would you?  But it does make the game faster).-Turn-based play makes it possible for multiple human players to play with each other on one computer.Cons:-Not the greatest graphics but it was made 10+ years ago, so not unexpected.-If manually played out a single game on a Large board with normal-hard AI opponents can take several weeks of casual play to complete.-Takes a while to get use to the rules of the game.  Things like; certain flying creatures can't be attacked by ground units, or the fact that allied units and cities of the oposite alignment have a chance of rebelling every turn and becoming enemies.  These types of detailed rules can make the game frustrating if you forget them.All this said:This game is easily worth double what they're charging.			",21,1,0,12,6,0,11
