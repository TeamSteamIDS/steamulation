												Although very impressive in terms of graphics, and an attempt at innovation, I am forced to write this game off as a techincal failure. I considered this game to be the largest disappointment in 4X history since MOO3. Also, be aware that there has been no updates since late 2013, which I think suggests that this game will not be getting any updates. From what I understand, the developers have no money to do so. Pros:- The graphics are some of the best ever seen for a 4X game, especially a space 1. The Mars 2 engine clearly was the centrepiece of their development.- They did try to make the game something other than a sequel with beefed up graphics and it does show. Certain aspects like the combat are now more sophisticated, with a damage ""grid"" and the concept of ""critical hits"" (very important). This is good. - If you've played SOTS 1, you'll know. There's a level of complexity here that you don't seen in other games, combining tactical and strategic combat. The problem is, a good deal of what made SOTS 1 outstanding is gone. - Game will run acceptably well on a low end system, despite the graphics. At time of this review, I am running this on a fairly high end system (overclocked 4.5 GHz CPU, an overclocked AMD r9 290, which as of 2014 is a fairly high end GPU, and an SSD). - Developers did make an effort to patch the majority of the issues and even offered a free DLC, the End of Flesh. - There was some effort to make the game modder friendly, but it appears to be incomplete. Cons:- You still get crashes at times. Not often, certainly not as much as launch, but it still happens. Most bugs are gone, but you stilll sometimes get CTDs, so save often. - The UI at times is hard to use and sometimes lags, even on a high end overclocked rig (and yes, I have tested this rig extensively for stability in my CPU, GPU, and RAM overclocks). An SSD does help somewhat I find though. The bigger issue though is the way the UI was designed. I've worked before in computer programming. A good UI is one that requires as few clicks (or as few taps as possible for touch devices) to get things done. This UI seems to be the exact opposite. A long learning curve in and of itself is not a failure, but it must serve some purpose. I am unsure as to if the UI was left in this state due to lack of funds, or due to the design decisions made.Another problem is that the game is very, very micro-intensive, particularly during late game. It's a much bigger issue than most 4X games. - The mission system is very controversial. I really, really hate it. It adds a layer of micro that makes managing large maps very hard, slows down the pace of the game without adding any depth, and causes other complexities. The problem is not so much that it added depth, it's that it did so without adding much to the gameplay itself. A huge step back from SOTS 1. - Certain features were poorly implemented or appear to be incomplete. For example, the private sector system was not very well done and adds micro problems at times. Given that there are no plans to patch this game, I fear that these features will remain this way. Another example of a feature that had to be axed was 64 bit (important I suppose for using more than 2Gb). - Autoresolve is in real time, so everything has to be played out in real time. Although imperfect, I would have liked an option to accelerate an autoresolve system. - There's a general lack of documentation with the game. You have to heavily rely on the wiki for information and to some extent the forums, although participation has since dropped since launch. I think that the wiki should be incorporated into the game somehow. - The AI is quite dumb I fear and at times, tends to mismanage their own empire into bankruptcy. Often times, what ends up happening is that you expand into the game and you encounter your first player, only to discover that they have really messed up empire management and will not be a challenge. In effect, this means that multiplayer is the only real area for challenge.- Compounding the issue above, this game does seem to have issues with network connectivity. I am not sure why as other games seem to be stable. I have asked around and I am not the only person with these problems. I have also fairly extensively tested my network's speed, latency, and stability (works fine on other games). - Worsening the issue further, this game does not have a very large multiplayer base, so your opportunity to play online is at times, limited- Normally, I would not put this in a review, but I have found the attitude of the lead developer, Mecron to be highly unprofessional at times. Although I expect trollish behavior from some of the forum participators, it is completely inappropriate for the developer themselves to be acting in such a manner. There's also a toxic atmosphere on the forums at times, where feedback, even constructive was not permitted and likely to be trolled. Essentially, I think what has happened is those who wanted to change the game for the better have been driven away by the cadre of people who believe the developers can do no wrong, and in effect you get this powerful ""groupthink"" mentality going on. People who recommend changes at times are attacked and portrayed as ""too stupid to understand why this game is a masterpiece"". I will admit the conduct of some of the feedback has been less than admirable. But at the same time, the conduct of those very loyal to this title has also been less than admirable. The critics though have recieved a disproportionate amount of the moderation. Recommendations: (Unlikely to be implemented due to the fact that this game is not getting patched and for reasons I have indicated above):- Give the player the option at the start of the game to go for a mission or a SOTS 1 system. I suspect the overwhelming majority of gamers will opt for the SOTS 1 system, save for a very vocal minority. - I get the impression that the developers did not understand why their first game, SOTS 1 was so successful. It was successful because it was intuitive, easy to play, had a reasonably good UI, but at the same time, a great deal of depth, particularly by the time AMOC and ANY was released. - Separate the tactical combat into something like Gratitious Space Battles from the strategic portion of the game and let people play ""Total War-style multiplayer"". This will probably make for a much more engaging game in multiplayer, allowing for shorter combat sessions to take place. Concluding remarks: The biggest problem of this game, apart from the stability issues and the poor AI, is the fact that it was not fun to play for a very large percentage of the SOTS1 fanbase. As I indicated above, I think there's a total ignorance of what made SOTS 1 so well recieved. The development team appears quite frustrated that their fundraising campaigns (they made a few additional efforts to raise money for development) have not been successful, but the issue I see is that they have demonstrated why they are worth additional funding to the majority. There has been a very hostile atmosphere towards feedback and an unwillingness to admit that certain problems exist, much less any indication that they will be addressed. Complexity in and of itself is not a problem. Neither is a very long learning curve. But the issue is that in this case, complexity never had anything to offer save in tactical combat. It feels like complexity at times was made ... for the sake of complexity. That in many ways detracted from the game experience. It's very painful for me to have to write this review like this. I really wanted to like this game. I can even see how this game could have evolved into one of the most awesome 4X games ever. But it's clear that in its current form, this game is the largest disappointment since MOO3 in the world of 4X gaming.			",44,2,0,12,15,0,23

To put it in a nutshell: Game was never finished. It's a shame because it would have been brilliant. currently, it's far from that.This should have been the most complex, enjoyable and best looking 4X Game in a decade. Tactical real-time space combat! Deep lore! 3D star map! Then: Sword of the Stars II release...and it proved to be an unfinished, lacking kinda good-looking buglagcrashdesaster.So, devs bowed their heads deeply to the ground and apologized. They promised to mend what was broken and to implement what was missing. To fix this mess. In the end all would be good. Fairy tale and all.I did believe them. They still had a large fanbase behind them that astonishingly enough held motly together and encouraged other people to buy this game, because Kerberos where devs to be trusted. They would do the job, finally. They must!Truth be told, I'm a cautious guy. I read the bad reviews. I read through the forums. No one said Sots II were a good game at this point. But it was highly promising So I decided to trust the devs. I bought the game, despite the state it was in. I knew this one would be finished. One day. I had time to wait.I played.  A lot. Did I enjoy this game? Yes, for some hours after mastering the steep learning curve. That's the good part.Honestly, I enjoyed a lot of the content. It still looks good for a 4X, sep. tactical combat. there's a feeling of scale watching your titans blowing puny Pirates out of the sky. There's a deep and meaningful lore behind the universe. A full 3D Star map. Very diverse species. Interesting tech tree with feasability studies, boost options and a chance to be stuck on projects, forcing the player to make choices and think ahead.But...the whole game still feels dead. There IS no Immersion. the sound track is horrible. Despite being a 3d map, the star map is pretty ugly, most off all nebulas and gas clouds. Low res sky boxes. Why? Then the realproblems started kicking in: UI design is horrible, AI is horrible (massive starvation and recession on all its planets...ouch), all-out-war ""diplomacy"", game still lags horribly. It crashes,  freezes, bugs out. A lot. And...there's still stuff missing after all those years!I really tried to love this game. I just...can't. I can admire the original concept, the lore, the art-work. Sadly, it didn't work out well.Situation today: Last update to this game is years back. Sots II is left to rot. It's really rather tragic then annoying. Kerberos just couldn't pull off this one and condemned themselves to work on tiny hand-held casual stuff instead. What a waste.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disappointing.Such promise, squandered. The interface and even at times design decisions make getting to the fun (and there is some fun buried there, somewhere) a lot of work.  When you finally get there it may also crash.There are a lot of amazing ideas here, but they're not explained very well, tend to lead to opaque mechanics that have invisible causes and effects, and generally it's impossible to recommend... but you can see the shadow of a truly amazing game that just didn't quite make it, if you like exploring such a thing.It also looks very pretty.  If you can cope with reduced graphics and not nearly as much innovative reach in exchange for understandable mechanics which actually work, you should play Sword of the Stars 1 - it is well polished and still the best space 4X I've played.

												Sadly, I have to mark this game down as a loss. I've logged hundreds of hours playing SotS1, pre-purchased this game, waited several months for patches and fixes, and the game is still a disappointment. Clunky, confusing (but beautiful) gameplay; consistent, early-game crashes-to-desktop; missing content... it's been dozens of months since initial release, and SotS2 is still incomplete. The game still feels mostly unplayable, and the parts that feel complete, in my opinion, feel tedious instead of fun. I've given the game a chance, put over a 150 hours into playing the game, and I just can't find it worthwhile. I'd love to see a return to the spirit of the SotS1, and I fully recommend getting Sword of the Stars: Complete Collection if you're a fan of 4x games (or strategy games, in general). This game, however, I cannot recommend.(P.S. If you find this review unhelpful, please comment with what information can be provided to make the review more helpful to you. Thanks!)

												Recommended for the hardcore 4X fan only.This game had THE worst launch I've ever seen (and I was there for Anarchy Online's launch).  When this came out, nothing worked.  Even the game option menus were disabled!  It was a total and absolute rip-off where completing a game was downright impossible.  But the developers worked HARD on the game after launch and have gotten this game on its feet.This is the most detailed 4X game I've ever played.  The star map is actually 3D and when battles happen you don't just roll some dice, you actually play the battles out in an RTS-style interface.  Ship customization is done by picking from different section types then selecting weapons and special equipment for those sections.  There's a pretty vast selection of equipment to pick from, too.The big controversial part of this game for me is the mission system.  When you tell a fleet to go do something (scout, patrol, whatever) in most games the fleet will go, do whatever it's supposed to do, and stay there.  In SotS2, the fleet will go out, do whatever it's supposed to do for a few turns, then return home.  You can change where 'home' is for a fleet but you can't select unpopulated planets for that.  On the one hand, this makes sense to me.  There are only so many peanut butter sandwiches you can store on a ship so it makes sense that they need to come back and restock.  On the other hand, it slows the pace of the game down and adds complexity.  I still can't decide if the extra realism is worth it.The most enjoyable feature of the old SotS game is, IMHO, the variety in races and that translates over to SotS 2 just fine.  You can't make custom races but each race is VERY different than the others.  The method of propulsion is different, technology strenghts and weaknesses are different, some races can mount more weapons than others, and so on.  When you get right down to it, switching between the Liir and the Humans in this game will give you much more different gameplay than building a custom race in most games.So I recommend the game but only to the serious 4X enthusiasts looking for a lot of depth.  If you're new the genre then you should probably stick with Civilization or Endless Space.  If you come out of those games wanting a lot more detail then this might be your game.P.S.  Star Fleet Battles fans - you'll find your swordfish drones and plasma shotguns waiting for you.  Enjoy.			",60,13,1,21,12,2,14

												Recommended? Sort of.I bought this at a steep discount years ago (less than 10 bucks), and have alternately loved and hated it ever since.The game was originally released in a mid-alpha state, resulting in a lot of the rage evidenced  in some reviews.  After a free expansion, about 50 mid-sized patches and over a hundred micro-patches, what you have is basically a game in permanent mid-beta.Most of what could be fixed without a complete redesign has been. What remains is an extremely time-consuming, mostly rewarding game that will occasionally infuriate you. Put simply, the Mars2 engine is a paper tiger; anyone who's seen videos of a North Korean Parade knows what I'm talking about here. Yes, it can display some very pretty and entertaining visuals and doesn't do too badly handling most of the  strategic- or combat- layer graphics that make the game fun. No, it simply cannot handle the dataload imposed upon it by an eight-player game.SotS 2's real saving grace is that it is extremely easy to mod, tweak, break, or bend to suit your gaming style. All you need is a basic grasp of English, some logical thinking skills, and a text editor. Most of the .entity, .section, etc. files are simple xml-coded text files. A free sqlite database editor will allow you to change almost anything in your saved games, too. Want to research everything? about 15 mins. with the .techtree file and my bugs -and bugs only- can play with every tech that matters to a bug (and some that don't). *Spoiler* This and some creative finacing gets me every tech in about 250 turns. The bad news: This game is never getting finished, is a resource hog, and crashes whenever it bites off more than it can chew. The multiple redundant autosaves are a lifesaver, but getting past some turn-to-turn crashes will require you to figure out which event was the straw that broke the engine's back. If we want this game to work perfectly, we'll have to redesign it ourselves, XML is easy to edit, but extremely wasteful coding (Micro soft-in-the-head designed xml). If Kerberos had gone with a more machine-centric scripting language, This game would be an all-time bestseller but would be much harder to mod.Tech Specs: You don't need a datashredder to play this game well (at least as well as it can be played). gen 3 core i3's in quad-core mode, or fm2-based quad cores are probably okay on data processing here, Sots2 cannot fully utilize 6 or 8 cores, so your best bets are a decent i5 or i7 from Intel (not necesessarily new), Kaveri-based quad core, or Vishera based CPU from AMD. My FX-8350 occasionally reaches 20% load, but I've modded the heck out of most game files to make battles more exciting. My A10-4600 laptop can run the vanilla game well. My old GTX 480 video card is overkill for the vanilla game at 1920x1080 with max detail, but I sometimes get a little hitching with all the extra ships and weapons I've modded into some battles.  Integrated video on an Intel chip won't get you anywhere, but the mid-range gaming qualites of an A10 laptop iGPU or A8 desktop iGPU is okay if you have extra RAM -see next-Memory!!! This is why you must have 64-bit windows. Don't have 8gb? Don't bother!. Between the poor engine choice, the leaky and ineffecient coding, and the sheer amount of data that needs to be crunched, this game eats memory fast. At turn 200 on a medium-large map with 4 of 5 players still alive and about half the map occupied, I'm using 20% of the 32gb of DDR3 in my desktop. My modding has a role to play there, but years of trial and error have shown me that 8-player games are simply not practical on nearly any machine with this game engine, and 6-player matches  require a custom computer with about $1k worth of parts in them. An 8gb computer with dedicated graphics can run Vanilla okay most of the time with 2-4 players.The Bottom Line-Is this an extremely time-consuming game? Yes! -though it's really not as bad as 90% of mmos- Is Sots 2 often frustrating? Yes!  Is it rewarding to play for 3 days, get to turn 220 and take a huge nap? Yes!! Is all of this really worth the hassle and a sizeable chunk of money? Probably not for 70% of  gamers who like consoles even a little. This is a great game for guys like me who've been gaming on semi-high-end computers since the late 90's. Getting the game into the state I have it in now is like owning the Millennium Falcon: You spend a lot of time now and then figuring out what's wrong with your mod, or if it's even your fault or the devs. You put some real effort into understanding and modifying this rustbucket of a game, have a lot of fun and get really frustrated when you spend an hour getting your empire just where you want it for turn 221 and it crashes just before you get around to saving. (Think Escape from Hoth in episode 5 here).  The real fun is taking a mostly functional scrapheap of a YT-1300 and trying to make it really fly (metaphorically speaking). Actual gameplay is a little better than the reality of war: Most of what you do during a turn isn't all that exciting, but it's pretty wild when space-lizards, telepathic dolphins and rat slavemasters all decide they want to cook you in your chitin just before you get the chance to nuke their homeworlds.   Thanks for reading my super-long post. I think it says something that I recommend this game to at least some people right after the metaphorical Falcon decided not to enter hyperspace with Rat Vader coming for me. (seriously, I stayed up all night playing with this thing only to have it crash around noon. 4hours later I've just finished typing a recommendation) :)			",149,7,2,49,21,0,63

												Years after the last patch, critical game breaking bugs still occur, basic features such as generated maps are lacking, balance issues like schizophrenic AI, and to finish it off bizarre design decisions like the fleet system remain unchanged.And a dev that to this day claims the publisher is activly preventing them from releasing patches, when the publisher has clarified that while they will not put any more money into this trainwreck, the devs are free to release patches if they so wish.Do yourself a favor, look into SOTS 1, Distant Worlds, or Galactic Civilizations instead for the space 4x fix.

												More bugs than an crackhouse mattress and crashes like a drunk chimpanzee in a demolition derby.  It gobbles down memory and then leaks it back out in a hundred places.  As we all know it was released unfinished.  Now, years later, it is still not finished and clearly never will be.The saddest thing is that even if all of these problems were fixed it still wouldn't be a good game.  Clunky interface, a UI that is more concerned with neon than functionality, and a plethora of just plain bad design decisions make you wonder how the same people who created the masterpiece that was the original Sword of the Stars could live with themselves after putting their names on this overpriced disaster.You can forget about balance anywhere.  Races, ships, technology, pirates, the economy - everything in this is completely out of alignment in some way or another.  Tutorials?  What are those?  The manual seems to have been written for a different game and is more concerned with giving background fiction than any usuable information.  Worst of all is that somehow, despite all the shiny new graphics and toys, they've made combat both look and play worse than the original (which was actually very good, by the way).  Metaphorically speaking, SotS2 is someone looking at a sports car that was SotS1 and saying ""You know what this thing needs?  A piano tied to the roof!  Yeah!  And we'll save weight by removing one of the tires!""Note that in sharp contrast the original SotS1 is a very good game, and I advise anyone considering this one to go buy that far superior product instead.  You won't regret SotS1.  You will regret this one, however.			",62,5,1,22,28,0,26

												3 yrs after the release and the game feels like a Beta. Massive memory leak, turns take ages even on small maps and the UI is really horrible.More bugs than I could count and most likely this is a dead project since it's been a year since last patch. This might be the greatest plunder in the history of videogaming in regards with the great reviews it had after the release. It was the first time I saw good reviews after an Alpha release and I'm never gonna buy a game again until 1 yr from the release has passed and I've read dozens of user reviews. Lesson learned.

												Completely unpolished, plenty of bugs, UI is awful and the AI is almost non-existent, add to that there's no random map generator - one was made by a user but the AI will not traverse the maps it creates correctly.On top of this the support is typical of an online game that's unfinished and made by an independant developer - manned by 20 year olds who make their support forum a wonderful place to swing their ego's instead of helping users.Don't get me wrong - the game itself has heaps of potential, but has not received a patch in 4 months as of this review and the developer has moved onto other god-awful games (going by their reviews).It gets a 4.4 critic and 4.6 user score on metacritic and I'm guessing that's more to do with the potential than the actual game itself.A real pity. Do not buy if you're after something really nice.			",98,9,0,27,22,0,53

												I bought this game in pre-order, since SotS1 was a good game, and this promissed to be even better. What a huge misstake. The game is not only buggy, the gameplay is often piled with good ideas working in a bad way.Ae: The mission system, feels more like a restriction to your movment, when compared to SotS1.  I let this game rest for a while, thinking Kerberos would be good devs and fix this pile of poop. Recently, I looked into it, and the gameplay is still horribly broken, the techtree is still pretty much a downgrade from SotS1 (no numbers on what the tech does, no info on what section it mounts etc.). The ship builder, while also filled with good Ideas is suffering from the same problems. I still played around to Round 40 in my trial game, when the game start taking many seconds, just to get to the next turn. After round 70 it just crashed. All time wasted.  I was let down by Kerberos, and soon after you only heared about the Pit or Groundpounders, both niche games for a far smaller audience. So it seems like these devs have bitten of more than they can swallow, and it serves them well. BUYERS beware!			",257,60,3,46,31,2,79

												4X Strategy is quite possibly my favorite genre. Add in ship design and deep research trees and I'm in heaven. The first SOTS game remains one of my favorite games of all time. Once SOTS 2 was announced, I was excited. Surely the sequel of my favorite game would be good, right?Not really.I picked the game up at launch. To say that it was an unplayable mess would be generous. Fast forward a year and some change, and it really hasn't gotten any better. Simple actions like moving ships are frustrating. Basic game mechanics are clunky and unintuitive, which makes doing anything a chore. This is unfortunate, because there is so much content there.Long story short, this is still a messy, clunky game. Unless you want to spend hours reading guides to even begin ""playing"" this game, just steer clear.			",183,36,0,37,12,0,22

												Recommended** - you have to be interested in large scale strategy games and be capable of either self teaching or searching for answersTL;DR - This is a good strategy game that doesn't require you to play the original to enjoy it (in fact you may be better off if you have NOT played the original). Just beware of the devs and fanboys.Sword of the Stars II is a 4X strategy game with turn-based empire management and fleet movement coupled with visually stunning real-time space combat with ships that you, the player, can design. Now, when I say design, I don't mean you determine the length and silhouette and window placement or any of that. When designing a ship you pick three sections (in game described as a Command [front] Mission [middle] and Engine [back] section). Once you have selected your sections you can place weapons of varying size and modules which provide bonuses like extra crew, increased range, and much more.But what about the factions? Well there are 7, the Humans, Hivers (insect like), Tarkasians (reptilian), Morrigi (avian/bird), Liir-Zuul Alliance (Liir are dolphin/whale like while the Zuul are genetically modified slavers that are difficult to define), Suul'ka Horde (Suul'ka are giant telepathic terrors of war that are allied with some more extreme Zuul) and the Loa (Artificially Intelligent race). Most of the factions have a very distinct system of faster than light travel (Morrigi, Tarka and Liir are all very similar with only minor differences) and each race has its own technological advantages and disadvantages.The Tech Tree is randomly generated each game and most techs require you to perform a ""Feasibility Study"" during which you spend a few turns determining how likely you will be in achieving a certain tech. This is where alot of the faction specific technological advantages come into play (for example the Morrigi have a better chance of getting high end energy weapon techs than the Tarkasians). This ""Feasibility Study"" is a very divisive topic, however, I personally enjoy it as it means that you can't start a game and know that you don't have Shield techs despite playing as the Liir (the Liir have the best Shield tech chance, however, this still happened to me). This means that each game has an element of unpredictability that is maintained into the late-game whereas a simple tech tree where you could see all your paths would mean that at turn 1 you could plan your entire game.Fleet Movement is also a divisive topic as ships cannot be moved unless they are in fleets with a dedicated command ship. I have personally had no issues with this system. You make a fleet and can then right click on a target, decide what to do and then select the desired fleet that is in range. Or, you can right click a fleet, select a desired action and then select a world in range.Diplomacy, unfortunately, is essentially non-existent. The AI behaves erratically and while it may accept a peace treaty on one turn it may declare war on you the very next turn. I always wanted to rule the galaxy alone anyways but it is still a major eyesore on the game.Finally, support for the game has, for all intents and purposes, ceased. The developers (which can be/are extremely difficult/stubborn) released a patch in August of 2014, however, there were no patch notes released and any comments on the patch were disregarded by the devs. As a result I cannot confirm or deny any of the findings, however, it is my suspicion that the AI was made more aggressive and everything else remained as it was before. But many people (fanboys?) will say that turn times are shorter and menus come up quicker and their cat came back from the dead after that ""non-patch"" as the devs deny any patch taking place.So if you are looking for a grand strategy game with real-time space battles, stunning visuals, a handful of unique races and a learning curve that provides a sense of accomplishment then I recommend you give this game a try. It's come a long way from the opening day launch disaster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved the first one.  It was incredible, and every expansion just became more in-depth. Backstory, artwork, tech trees... load of fun, gorgeous, and engrossing.  It made me want to support this company in any way I could; even the spin-off The Pit is fun and cute while being challenging and demanding.This...  I just can't get into it.  I tried, I really did. I even came in after the bugs were fixed and enhanced was out, because the world-building and story here is just so engaging.  But... the magic feels like it was gone in the gameplay.Everything is more complicated, micromanaging lots and lots of small space stations is now a core gameplay element. And now, half the tactics that were interesting in the old game are impossible (like parking Deep Scan picket ships in deep space to watch for approaching fleets). You can't send lone scouts anymore, you have to create a scouting mission first, make a fleet, maybe assign an admiral, and put a half dozen ships together. Some of those ideas (like automating missions and adding admirals) would have been INCREDIBLY interesting, and a great addition to another expansion of the first game (like how trade was expanded in aMoC), but now you're shoehorned into it, and the tense early game with a few lonely destroyers playing cat & mouse in uncharted space with unknown enemies is gone. It feels like a completely different company's product.  I wish... I REALLY wish I could recommend SotS II.  But I have to say no. ",46,14,1,7,7,0,22

It has most of what's in SotS1 but its just filled with so much more bloat and covered in pretty graphics. The mission system - horrible bloat. Prototyping new designs - garbage idea. The tech tree is less interesting. Colonizing planets is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ If you want good space based 4x gameplay, get SotS1 and pass this junk over.			",130,17,2,30,11,0,26

												You'd think I'd have something extensive to say about the game. Problem is... I don't. Its the same game it always was and will be. Translation: its slowly getting better and better.But is it there right now?*shakes head side to side*.Amazingly the game still likes to crash after all this time. There are serious bugs which break MP and a few glaring balance issues as well for certain factions.So... why am I recommending it? Simple. It will get better and, well... there simply isn't another 4x space game which comes anywhere near it. Even Sots Prime pales in comparison. If you have the patience for it, its a great game. But if you're a player which must have their game complete in 30 mins or so, this isn't for you. Matches can take hours, days or even weeks.Do remember to check the forums for the game for information... and my screenshots. yes, shameless plug.			",183,40,8,39,39,2,98

												Most of the issues have been detailed in other reviews, so I'll keep this one short.If you are a fan of the original SotS, just stick with the Complete Collection (Born of Blood, Murder of Crows, and Argos Naval Yard) and avoid this. The prettier graphics, bigger ships, and larger systems are not worth all the bugs, dreary gameplay, random crashes, and generally unfinished nature of the game (the in-game SotS-pedia help guide is mostly blank pages or just unhelpful). Trust me.If you are looking into Sword of the Stars and want to buy this one because the graphics look better and the story seems cooler than the first one, don't waste your money; go buy the original Sword of the Stars Complete Collection and enjoy the game and the universe before it was left out in the cold to die. If you ignore this and figure that you'll pick it up anyway and give it a shot, and you end up being disgusted with it, do yourself a favour and pick up the first game and try it too.

												I wanted this game to be fixed, but as of 11/14 it is still a smoking pile. There are a *ton* of mechanics that are just completely un-explained. You can find guides and youtube video's where people try to explain. Most of the time its literally them not understanding, but explaining how they managed to get it to somewhat work. The tech is interesting, combat is very meh mostly because the AI is TERRIBLE at it.Its not nearly as buggy as launch, and it does run MUUUUCH faster, but the AI is terrible and that just makes the gameplay completely lackluster. I got to a point where I had 3-4 battles every few turns, and if I automated them it would be a complete loss, but if I micro'd them myself it would be a flawless victory with my ships sustaining very little damage. Considering the tediousness of having to manually control *EVERY* fight, I couldn't even finish a game, it would have taken me about 3 years!Overall, SWOTS 1 was a vastly superior game, I had hopes for this one, but the developers really dropped the ball....and then kicked it down the street and into the gutter.

												This game breaks my heart. Sots 1 was an indie masterpiece. So many 4x games are dry and formulaic, Sots 1 broke the mold with incredibly asymmetric races, abilities, and technologies. There was so much potential here. In Sots 2 the graphics are beautiful, the tech tree is great, more races, more ship components, all more of the awesome stuff that made Sots 1 great. But for some inexplicable reason they took a decent fleet management system and made it 20x more complicated and fiddly. Now trying to do a basic thing like invade a planet involves multiple counter intuitive steps, making the whole thing a chore. Lastly and most unforgivable, they took a reasonable 'autoresolve' system and decided to make the ships fight it out in near-realtime. I imagine the goal here was to create a more accurate autoresolve, but all it results in is 5 minutes each turn watching dots frentically zig around a radar and thoughts of ""How could I possibly have lost that battle?"". Go play Sots 1.			",306,110,10,72,53,5,111

												Kerberos shows amazing dedication to their game. SOTS2 is quite fun now, and continuing to improve. This game is FAR better than it was upon release. Given that Kerberos is continuing to patch SOTS2, the game's only going to continue getting better. Overall, the game's certainly worth giving a shot now. The interface and design language do have a bit of a learning curve, but it's worth the effort.			",585,194,8,128,73,5,161

												Let me start by saying this:  I would normally NOT recommend this game to people.  I'm kind of weird in the fact that buggy games don't bother me too much, and I have a lot of patience for unfinished games or games with unrealized potential.  I also have to restart the game every few hours if I'm doing a long play session because of memory leaks, and I have 24 Gigs of RAM.  This game's a technical nightmare, and isn't receiving support from the publisher anymore.  The developer still exists, but is hanging on by a thread.I recommend, if you're even interested in this game, to check out the first game.  It is easier to learn, and very stable.  It would be awesome to see this game finished, but it won't happen anytime soon, if at all.I think one of the biggest tragedies of this game is simply the lore and the story.  This game has no campaign, only custom scenarios, like most other 4x games.  The game includes what's called a Sotspedia that's more in depth about things than other comparitve things like Mass Effect's codex.  The lore behind the major factions/races is inredibly deep.  In fact, I own a book that takes place in this universe.This is also evident in how each faction/race has not just their own strengths and weaknesses, but they have completely different methods of FTL travel, which has a huge impact on the gameplay.  Things from the Tarka's standard warp drive, the Hiver's gate network for instant teleportation once they slowboat it to new systems and set up a gate, to the Liir's stutterwarp drives, using thousands of teleportations a second to move, increasing in speed the further away from gravity wells they get.  They're all pretty interesting.  And there's 7 of these factions.But, again, I cannot recommend this game unless you're hardcore into this genre, and want to find what is, perhaps, both a hidden, yet flawed and tarnished gem.  I love this game so much, but I cannot just tell people to check it out.  I want them to consider this game, while informed.If you're at all interested, I recommend checking out the wiki.  It has a lot of helpful and interesting information.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THE GOOD: Basically a sci-fi Total War game. You have the campaign map where you buy ships, order fleets onto missions, and generally have a nice 4X time. When you encounter another player -> zoom into the tactical map for real time action. The campaign map is beautiful, each faction gets a different movement mechanic from the standard warp drive of one race to instatanious gates and node lines of others. You really feel like a unique race not a re-skin. This keeps up with the ship designs, some races are hulking great beasts, slow and powerful, others are quick and fragile. Humans for instance have decent all-rounder ships, slightly less well armed than average but fast over the strategic map, unfortunately the drive section is very fragile and can strand your ships far from home.Did I mention that? Yeah your ships are distructable in nice modular chunks, from individual turrets to command/mission/drive sections. Add to that a 4-facing armour matrix, shields that are very well balanced IMO, weapons that all have a use (though you will rely on a few favourites if you don't have a special need), and the tactical combat will keep you entertained alone.THE BAD:It's shonky, no two ways about it. The campaign UI is a bit slow to respond, after about 200 turns it takes quite a while for the calculations to play out and ocationally crashes (but that has got much better since release, in fact no crashes for ~ 3 months). Sometimes stuff doesn't update or doesn't work for no particular reason, and last but not least: THERE IS NO IN GAME WAY TO LEARN.Yes that annoys me, you spend countless man-hours making a great combat game with a slightly shonky campaign layer and don't tell anyone how to use it. Thankfully the community has stepped up to the challenge and fixed this, creating beginners guides and guides on individual races (start with the Tarka, they are the most straight forward - or Hiver if you like to turtle). The guides are good, use them.Another area that needs attention is the AI, it's pretty bonkers. It will declare war on your massive empire and send colony ships to bombard your planets which get killed straight away by planetary missiles (did I mention missiles, yeah there are missiles, and point defence for your ships, and weapons platforms... I like the tech). It will also be bestest mates with you but be mildly miffed you ""stole that tasty planet near me"" for 100 turns and then declare a holy war to wipe the stain of your civilization from the galaxy with 10 Leviathan class ships when all you wanted to do was trade with everyone and be a mecantile hippy empire (still sore about that).When the campaign AI works it can be pretty impressive, I think it managed to plan an invasion once and pulled it off simultaniously against me and two other AI. That invasion was let down by the tactical AI (better but not exactly Sun Tzu) and a wall of torpedo platforms.THE UGLY:Three words, randomised tech tree. Some people hate it, some love it. I am in the second camp. But, I also loved the randomised discovery in Alpha Centuari (I don't care if it's not balanced, that's how science works guys, sometimes you miss a really obvious idea). Certain techs are always available, like cutting lasers, and dreadnought ships. Others, well, it's the luck of the draw. The Zuul are having an energy weapon bonanza and enslaving your planets? If you're lucky just research the ""♥♥♥♥ you energy weapons"" shield (only covers the front, not quite as OP as at first sight). If you're not lucky, well hopefully the cash you save in equipping that shield will let you build more ships and the Zuul run out of light to put in their lasers. It's about rolling with the punches, but it is pretty galling when those punches are a fleet of heavy phaser drones and your stuck with the crappiest point defence. It's also pretty horrible when your home planet gets glassed 10 turns in by a ghost ship.Yeah, ghost ship I hate the ghost ship. Like a '90s RPG you are subjected to random encounters (I think they are not completely random but it feels like it). This mechanic is at the same time absolutely horrible and absolutely brilliant. It's horrible when 10 turns in, your economy is trashed by a giant wandering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (built by the humans and then lost forever to wander the stars... the lore is actually pretty cool). It's brilliant when your struggling colony, with only that admiral you should retire because he got the shakes (yeah your admirals have stats, some are mass murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, some just like to grow flowers) - but can't quite let go because he won that battle that one time - and a couple of second rate ships for support, is being slowly worn down by slaver attacks. Admiral shaky holds his battered squadron together while the new guy from the academy is bringing reenforcements in the form of the newest (and cheapest) system defence craft.The random encounters make you feel like starfleet command, an ancient derelict in one system, a hive of wasp-like silicon lifeforms in another, colony alpha-nine has an incoming metor shower. More variety would make it perfect, an option to turn off mr ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ghost ship would be sublime.THE SHOWDOWN:Would I recommend this? Yes I would. Mostly because it deserves to do well. It improves on everything SOTS1 fell down on and expanded what it did well. It's not perfect by any means but it has ambition that alot of sequels lack. Paradox could have played it safe, they could have updated SOTS1, make a few fixes to the dodgy bits and called it a day. They didn't. They fixed the broken stuff and then said ""You know what would be cool? Building science stations to observe pre-FTL aliens. Letting players build Bablyon 5. Treaties that real civilisations would make (re-create the treaty of Farixen). A ship that shoots asteroids at planets (actually in the first one but it's really cool)"". Like I said some of it doesn't work, the science stations are better suited to sitting behind your lines researching important things, from what I can tell Bablyon 5 doesn't do much, the AI won't make interesting limitation treaties with me, but the asteroid gun is great.The tactical combat is the best bit, the strategic map feels like a way to move ships to make fun battles happen. I really wish Paradox would release a single player campaign about a lost human exploration fleet, a load of linked missions with persistent officers who learned? Excellent. In the mean time, admiral shaky has some slavers to kill.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												as a FANATICAL fanboy of the origional game, it GENUINELY hurts me to type this, butDO NOT BUY.the game was a patheticly unstable mess at release (either due to being rushed by the publisher, or the devteam being FAR too ambitious and not capable of proving they needed additional time to deliver), and due to the publisher's/Developer's refusal to stick with their guns and FIX THEIR BROKEN PRODUCT, its never significantly improved. the stability issues HAVE been significantly mitigated, but the product never delivered on its origional promises, and frankly, just isnt fun.aside from stability/being obviously incomplete (Kerberous GAVE UP on fixing it back in 2013, and promptly started trying to kickstart/sell other games, seriosuly NOT cool guys!),a lot of things were unneccesairally changed form the Previous game, simply for complexity's sake.the poorly thorught-out Feasability study system forces you to spend up to 20 turns finding out if you CAN successfully reserch something (comparitively, the randomised techtree in SOTS 1 simply doesnt display an item thats not reserchable), and fails to give you a 100% yes/no answer. this is the gamepaly change that honestly irritated me the MOST, alongside the Admiral system (RE: a hardcap on the number of fleets you can use IN A 4X GAME, alongside of FORCED debuffs on every ship invovled if you only have an incompitant Admiral available).the shame is, if they'd simply gone for a ""safe"" sequal by doing ""Argos navy yard in the new engine, with some added content AND retuning things over time"",the game would have been MUCH more favourably recieved.and the TRAGIC thing is the new version of the MARS engine is graphically GEORGOUS! ship models are MUCH better quality than in SOTS Prime (which ,while a VERY solid game, is rapidly showing its age graphically).unless there is a MASSIVE community patch/modding project released, and i STRONGLY suggest you confirm that there is a fucntional one beforehand, DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.you're better off picking up the ""Sword of the Stars (1) Complete Collection"" for 10 bucks instead, and palying either via Direct ip connection with your friends, or evolve/gameranger/tungle.

												This game is unfinished and a buggy mess. It may not work on some systems and it will require you to spend quite a bit of time messing with setting on your own system to keep it stable.That warning being said, it is one of the best and most immersive 4x games I have ever played and unfortuantly probably ever will. This game's strengths lie in its nitch. If you like customization, detail and long term and large scale planning this game will scratch you just right. Here are the features which wowed me. Massive research tech trees, which improve and change the way you play, build ships, colonize and dominate. Arguably the games strongest feature is the modular ship system. Ships come in three scales, and each set allows for moduals of its basic parts, improvments from addons; to extra power generators, extra crew, more armor, better structural integrity etc.  If you like heavily customizing nearly every detail of your modular ships from replacing small cannon turrets to Point defence turrets (or anything inbetween) you'll like that. The major aspect of this game which stands out to its peers? Meaningful Real time combat. Heavily tacticle, great graphics and impressive physics. Few things made me as giddy as watching one of my carrior ships launch dozens of fighter craft to swarm enemy supply ships. Or building a massive missle fleet dedicated to long range warfare of overwhelming the enemy defenses with missles barrages. Watch some youtube videos of its combat and you'll be stunned how well this game does it. Unfortuantly, this game as much as I love it. Is awful. LIttle to no tutorials; you'll need to rely heavily on trial and error and online guides and refrences. I fully didn't know what the heck I was doing until maybe twentyfive hours or so of game time. Game is unstable: keep to maps small and the amount of factions smaller. Turning on some features of the game such as a high amount of random encounters will simply make the game crash every couple of turns. There are known memory leaks and if you don't have a beefy computer you may have to close and reload the game after a couple hours to improve performance. Elements of the game are just not there. The diplomacy is effectivly non-existant. You can do basic things such as, spy, ask for help/money and sue for peace and declare war and trade. It works as in it does just that and nothing else. All AI unless team setup at the beginning of the scenarios settings will eventually declare war on you and attack. Several factions are missing units or don't have fully implamented technologies. AI is weird: sometimes it is surpfisingly clever or even overwhelming. Other times its cripplingly dumb and easily beaten. Mutiplayer is quagmire. Sometimes it works perfectly and some of my buddies and I will play a four hour sessions without one of us crashing or getting any bugs and we love it. Many times, we are unable to even connect to the host lobby: sometimes it simply does not appear, other times there are connection issues, some of us can see and or join the game while others can't. Weird problems like that. Luckily the game has save game for multiplayer and allows everyone to rejoin in case of crash or just done for the session.In conclusion, this game had so much potential to be the best 4x hardcore game ever made. What is sadder still; in m any regards it actually is. The amount of detail and depth to this game is unparralled. So many factors and elements and so many diffrent ways to play and truely varied factions makes this game's ambition without equal. It is the only 4x game with an advanced combat engine which is both excellent in graphics and in gameplay. Ship designing, empire building and tech research are supurbly well done and will draw out the micro and macro manager of you. Unfortuanlty it was also never finished and severly suffers from its unfinished grand vision and pelthora of bugs, some being game breaking. Lacking core features such as diplomacy and scenarios (outside of open ended), I cannot recommed this game to the average player. If you are like me and actually like detail oriented games, grand strategy and tactics games, and with some patience, you may just find a gem here.			",86,8,0,29,22,0,55

Each weapon and armor has its advantages and disadvantages.The game has this low price because it had a bad beggining with lots of bugs, but most of them have been fixed, the game is playable and the devs are still giving it support.If you didn't play Sword of the stars 1, this is a must play, at least for a new experience compared to other games.And if you played Sword of the stars 1, this one has much better combat.

												Despite its (very) bumpy start Sword of the Stars II has received constant attention and updates that has finally brought it up to playable standards. However, it is still inferior to its predecessor. Much of the core game mechanics have become unnecessarily overcomplicated in an attempt to “deepen” gameplay. Fleet management is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and fighting across an entire solar system, while sounding cool in concept is very tedious in practice. What this game does have going for it though is space battles actually do look really cool. Watching neon lasers and missiles fly about especially between the bigger ships is quite satisfying. But of course pretty graphics doesn’t make the game. Gameplay does and for that purpose you should just stick with Sword of the Stars I. However, I would like to emphasize that Sword of the Stars II is not a BAD game in of itself. There are many other, far worse, strategy games out there and SoTS II is in fact about average. It’s just the fact that as a player and fan of the first game, the flaws are just that much more glaring and painful seeing an already proven formula get bogged down with some rather nonsensical mechanics and changes.

												First thing I want to say about this game is that it has a hefty learning curve - read the manual and then some guides, expect your first couple games to go poorly and remember there is friendly fire in this game.I've heard this game is buggy - 90 hours in and it's only crashed to desktop on me once (0.011 crashs per hour isn't bad IMO), It can take a while between turns as the game goes on but most 4X games I've played do that.One of the things I love about this game is the varity in the different factions - find one that works for you.Another thing I liked was the mission system - you have to tell your fleets what you want them to do when you send them out - once they do it they come back to base to repair and resupply.Like all 4X games it's got a slower pace - These types of games aren't for everybody - if you like complex games that require thought and planning this might be a good fit for you.***UPDATE***After playing some multiplayer I have encountered more bugs than before - another crash to desktop and some disconnects (both myself and other players).If you don't have a good STABLE interent connection you'll have a hard time playing multiplayer on this game.

												I didn't get to play the original Sword of the Stars II: Lords of Winter on release.The game was so buggy that even the publisher, Paradox Interactive, apologized for it.Paradox has released so many games with so many bugs that they should be immune to criticism by now, so for them to call a game “buggy” is newsworthy.On the bright side, Paradox is also pretty responsive in terms of getting bug patches out early and often. The game was eventually brought into a playable state and some more content was added.Thus resulted the game we have today: Sword of the Stars II: Enhanced Edition.I like complicated games.In general, the more complicated the mechanics are, the more involved I get.Paradox in particular is known for putting out these sorts of mega-games, where the learning curve is tougher than quantum physics and just playing the game is an accomplishment.The point of complexity, however, is to provide the player with meaningful decisions appropriate to their position in the game.SotS2 is a failure at almost every level in terms of making complexity fun. One can play this game for hours and simply have no idea what is going on.In a game like this your decisions should be meaningful.You should know you are making a decision, be clearly presented with all the relevant information, know what your options are, and understand how your decision will impact the game.SotS2 ruins any possibility of making meaningful decisions by completely confusing the player.It's hard to tell when a decision is being made in the first place.To a large extent this is synergistic with another problem: there are so many decisions to be made that it unclear when you are making an important decision and when you're not.The tech tree itself is misleading. Every game you get a different selection of techs, and even among those certain (random) techs will not be available to research this game.There are some very questionable design choices that make just playing the game a pain.The 3D star map is confusing and misleading.The distances between systems are difficult to determine.Rotating the display around to get a better idea of things is headache-inducing and leaves the player lost. Star maps should just stick to being 2D until 3D displays work.Is there anything good about this game?Well, the ships look cool.And the backstory is awesome.When I read the background material and skimmed the intro material this looked like such a cool game.I really, really wanted this to be good. In summary, Sword of the Stars 2: Enhanced Edition is a confused, sprawling mess of a game. The user will spend most their time confusedly clicking on buttons. Overall 6/10.

												It's actually a great 4x turn based game. I enjoy every bit of it and I typically dislike most 4x games. I even enjoy the combat sequences which is presented in a bit more of an RTS style despite my inability to actually play most RTS games well. However, as you'll note with many other reviews, the game is incomplete with little to no hope of it ever being finished. Conducting a multiplayer game is a nightmare, assuming you can actually get one going. The game crashes quite often for most players, typically giving a MARS error. Ultimately, despite how fun it is, I cannot suggest it because it just doesn't work.			",100,13,1,25,7,1,6

												It's feature complete and stable as of Aug 2014. Many people complain about the shift in game mechanics but that's just individual preferance. However, there's no way around a non-existant AI which overshadows all other aspects of the game.Simply put, the AI, both in strategic battle and tactical, is not there; imagine a beautiful playground with no one but yourself.I really enjoy the SOTS universe and all the spinoffs but unless you can find people in MP (almost impossible) I would recommend leaving this game be.

												This game could have been the shining jewel of the space 4x genre. The space combat system was amazing and ambitious. With more polish and development it could have been the greatest space fleet RTS ever made. Sadly it never got that polish. The base systems are all there, and you can clearly see what it could have been.The strategy portion as well was very ambitious and detailed, but again didn't get the finish it needed.Huge potential, sadly wasted by either a rushed launch, publisher woes, or developer mismanagement.

After 4 years it is now passable but not good and still missing parts like the diplomacy section.  Also the achievement system is broken so that it is impossible to get a perfect game score even if you get all of the achievements.  You have been warned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The other reviews of this game are quite old by now. The game has updated plenty since release, fixing many of the bugs and performance issues other reviewers were having.While not the same as the original Sword of the Stars, SotS 2 is a great 4x game. It adds a great amount of complexity and diversity to the already diverse SotS formula. The fleet command interface is strange compared to the original SotS but once you get used to it it is quite reasonable. The only problem I have with this game (besides some minor interface quirks) is the AI. As other people have complained, the AI has a tendency to just camp around its homeworlds for the entire game. But this, however, does not mean that the AI will be sedantary. The AI will send you fleets composed of a dozen different designs, making the tech to see the loadouts of enemy ships completely useless, because the AI never ♥♥♥♥in' sticks to any one design.

												Oh where to begin, On release this game was for lack of a better word an abortion. Something so devoid of functionality and entertainment it could only be called a game by the strictest legal definition. However I withheld my judgement and after an eternity away and countless patches here it is.Pros:In spite of its many flaws theres still some good to be found in this game. It was incredibly ambitious and attempted to expand upon its predecessor in every possible facet and had they done it correctly it would easily have revolutionized the genre. True to its predecessor you have several unique races that all certainly handle and feel different with plenty of customization in ship design far exceeding what was available in #1 with the addition of battleriders, psychic abilities, modules, new weapon mounts and ammunitions as well as commanders with their own traits and abilities it truly goes above and beyond as far as being able to micromanage your armies and strategy to perfection. The game is also pretty, for its genre, some people have managed to make some pretty sexy screenshots though its certainly not the game (or genres) selling point. Unfortunately this is about all they managed to get right.Cons:For starters, at launch it was buggy beyond all reason, to the games credit it seems to be all fixed now, I have not had even a single crash or bug in months, but your experience may (and probably will) differ. Along with all the cool new stuff added they also created a ton of needless, tedious addition, and draped it all in one of the most time consuming interfaces on the planet. Getting anything, even the simplest of things done in this game seems to take a minimum of 3 menus and at least 12 clicks. It's just insane. Combined with the new basing constraint on fleets and the 'mission' system which adds further unnecessary clicks and forces you're fleets to  return home for no real reason after literally every action they take is beyond monotonous. There's also the prototyping which is an abortion, costing tons of money and countless turns to redesign a ship from having a mass driver to a plasma cannon needs triple the time and all my money, even though I already have other ships using the plasma cannon. You can be an all intelligent dolphin thats mastered the art of space travel, can drop a plague on a planet turning all your enemies into zombies, and turn your opponents head into a blood pumpkin with your mind, but you're too friggin dumb to understand modular construction techniques. Lastly the game is just terribly optimized requiring a far more powerful machine than it should to run properly and even then at some point your still going to suffer massive slowdowns at countless load screens and menu transitions.Overall this game had tremendous potential but it just fails terribly at living up to its own ambition. It's like wiping with sandpaper. Sure it might get the job done, but it's slow, gritty, and just downright painful at times. I loved the first one, and I can still find a bit to like in this one, just not enough to recommend it to anybody. Anyone who is wanting to experience the Sword of the Stars, I highly suggest you look at the first game instead.			",93,7,0,49,20,0,29

So Far...The second part of Sword of the Stars isn't what I expected, and as so many before me, I have to say it's disappointing in many ways. Graphically a slight bit better than it's predecessor, it's giving a lot of pain in many details. But I will give that soon in Pros and Cons.The game does lag a lot, even with lowered details, all special effects switched off and on lower resolution, you actually do need a lot of memory, even when you run the game on a quad-core System.The player is factually drowned in information, you can do too much micromanagement of your empire - the same mistake that led to the downfall of Master of Orion III in public reviews. The Lore of your race can be looked up in the game 'cyclopedia, which actually is nice, because the information is given in digestible bits and pieces.I was just glad, not to hear the strange squeal of shot down SolForce ships, that annoyed me in the first part, the sound was slightly more polished - and I will try to play a bit more of the game, but it's not the game I expected, neither has it anything good and barrier free as the first part... Oh, and german players, you will have a lot better playing experience when you play in english - fully free of strange artefacts in the descriptions because there was some issue with our ö,ä,ü, and ß in some words.Pros:Added Races.""Online"" Encyclopedia.Graphically more up to date.Multiplanet Systems instead of one world systems.Cons:Laggy, the game actually seems to have problems calculating the outcome of moves.Buggy, Immersion Empires have the tendency to crash.Too much micromanagement, which will grow into buerocratic tape, the killer of fun.Research is a bit of strange now, with first asserting the technologies success...Moderate issues with other topics like diplomacy, colonization, terraforming, production and stuff.Not RecommendedEven though I am a great fan of 4X games and especially space empire simulators, I can't recommend this game in good conscience. Sadly some things were overdone, putting the player into a frightful tight between overmanagement and minutae details, very finely crafted especially for perfectionistic buerocrats. But the fun of the first part with breathtaking  battles between fleets will come a bit short, and aren't as enlighting as in the first part. Furthermore there are other issues, the lags, some of the bugs and of course the detailed aproach can scare off any newbie to the genre. I am quite the veteran in such games, but sadly, and as much as I first was very happy to have the game in my library, I am not quite accomodated with the game.The only question that keeps me pondering, how would the game have fared if this one hadn't put Kerberos, the developers behind it, out of business? Hmmmm...?			",1554,811,52,244,215,11,265

												It takes some newer hardware to run it well...for what you'd expect to be an easy to run game. Without an SSD and modern CPU the time to process a turn will take a while on a large map once there is a lot of traffic. The game is built on a database like system so there is a lot of disk I/O. Run it from a RAM disk if you can. Deplomacy in AI games is completely missing for the most part. You might get a cease fire or even a non-agression treaty, but in a few turns they will declare war again. In my 200+ hour of game play I got an alliance once...and about ten turns after forming the alliance the AI declared war. So just keep that in mind...you will have no friends in an AI map.The worst part of this game is the pirates. It takes a lot of infrastructure to reduce the chance of them occuring and even then they still will...and on large maps you might have ten pirate attacks to sit through in a game turn. That's at least 10 minutes of completely wasted game time and you can never do anything about them anyway. Even if you have defenses in range you only have 2.5 minutes so you will not likely be able to destory the ships and save your frieghter. Do your self a favor and edit your base chance for pirates to occur to -2.00 in the game's commonassets.xml file. You will also notice faster turn times and nothing of value will be lost.The rest of the game is flat out awesome. I'd personalyl rate SoTS2 as the best 4x game on the market right now or the best modern one at least. The combat mehanics of ships not fighting as well when they take damage is really rare and makes it a cut above the rest of game alone. The weapons are ballanced pretty well...not perfect, but if your research options limts you one type you are not going to be dead in the water (though not getting point defense will make me just restart the game since you learn this early on, but that is it). The graphics are decent...better than they need to be. The fleet system isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. The only complaint I have is that you have to have a command ship in every fleet which is always a less combat capable ship. I am sure the Admiral could radio the rest of the ships in the fleet from any ship. The combat is some what 3D...this could be better, but it is still pretty good.So yeah...that was a bit of a mixed review, but I am still giving this game a thumbs up. I'd recomend it to any one, though pay attension to my warning on the hardware. Don't get this for your seven year old laptop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game was a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥upon launch, it was basically the worlds first early access title without actually being called that. Basically, Kerberos ran out of money, so they launched prematurely, and of course this caused a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥storm with what was basically a fresh out of alpha game hitting store shelves.They pretty much fixed it now, though. I've never had it crash on me, and it's the deepest, most autistic total war copy out there. It's honestly one of my favourites and if you want to dump 20 hours into one 20 star (theres 300 star systems) map, this is the game to do it.I recommend naming your dreadnoughts and leviathans, it really gives it a cinematic feel when you see the SS 420 vent reactor plasma into the aether and you drive it towards the oncoming fleet in a climactic last stand.

												Somewhat polished but seemed to crash even during the first 15-20 turns of gameplay. Interface is unintuitive and there is no tutorial. However, the main letdown was inability to randomly generate a map with given parameters. There is only a handful of premade maps out of which you must pick one to play a game on. GFX was nice and modern enough and races seem to have been generated to be unique enough. Tech tree is sort of nice. In general, however, I feel there might be better 4X space games out there. Might be worth a try if you get it for less than 5 EUR on sale.			",215,55,0,67,45,0,94

												I actually pre-ordered the game due to thousands of hours of gameplay on SOTS1 and was really disappointed in what happened (it was actually in a worse state than today).  It's at least been patched to a mostly stable build now.  Gameplay wise,  it has some nice innovations that are not found in Sword of the Stars I (SOTS 1).  It takes some getting used to but otherwise a nice new dynamic to strategic play.Unfortunately due to things (I would read the forums on both steam and Kerberos/Paradox) happening, the game is in quite the state.   There's a memory leak/optimization problem that crashes the game within 100 or so turns (sooner if you play on larger maps) which makes it hard to hit end-tier tech.  The AI is also somewhat gimped and diplomacy is basic at best.As much as I love the game for all it's faults, I can't recommend others buy it unless it's both on sale and if you at least have a passing interest in the game.

												This game has for all intents and purposes reached early Beta version status years after its commercial release.The game looks, feels and is incomplete and unrefined. Bugs are not uncommon. No further improvements are expected since funding for the game was officialy cut off.I was, and still am, a fan of the original Sword of the Stars. I expected incremental improvements from the sequel, and that was very fine by me. Sadly, the game was released in an unplayable and unfinished state, probably the worst release I have personally seen. Despite extensive patching since then, the game never reached its potential.If you are looking for a space strategy game there are dozens better ones out there, including the first Sword of the Stars.

												G'day all, Things I've discovered:1. For some reason the game seems to crash if I start it from the shortcut, but if I start it using the play button in steam library and then shift tab in and then out of steam the game seems to run stable as a metronome. Don't know why; it just works that way for me. Played it 14 hours straight over the Australia Day long weekend without it missing a beat.2. THIS REALLY IS A GREAT GAME, I've been playing 4X since Supremacy - Your will be done and Imperium Galactic, both on Amiga 500 and this game is probably one of the best I've seen in a long, long time. Actual it’s a thinking mans (gals)  game.3. The level of complexity and depth is amazing, it takes quite a while to fully grasp the mechanics of how this game works even after reading the manual/s cover to cover a couple of times and watching a boat load of YouTube.  Thank whatever deity you have, that the Devs didn't appear to go down the 'lets dumb it down for console path' like so many others have lately (Sid). For pity sake people PCs these days are so fast and can process so, so much that 4X SHOULD be about super micro management. I've been making spreadsheets like crazy, in order to track all the vessels in my fleets (by name, class, registry and assignment) my Fleet Admirals, my space station developments, OMG how amazing is this game.4. It's such a pity that this game was rushed out and got the absolute thumping that it deserved, but I can tell you that all the fix up work that went in to it finally turned out a really good game.  Unfortunately it still doesn't look as graphically polished as it could, (UI and all), but the ships are superb and look amazing in the ACTUAL tactical combat piece. This alone beats so many other space 4X hands down.5. Ship Micro-management Heavan :-) your ships have weapons, upgradable/exchangable (in real 3d not some 2d drawing/plan thingy), your ships have pods (marines, cargo, extra crew, extra energy etc) your ships have drive systems (upgradable with reasearch) and your ships have dorsal and lateral armour and shields (and forward facing deflectors if you research and build them). ALL these things are seen in tactical combat and you have to properly manage your ship's weapons, shields, direction that they are facing towards enemy (with spin and roll systems). ALL these things really, actually count towards not getting your backside handed to you in the few short minutes of (pausable) real tactical combat. [Love it, Love it, Love it]. Depth people, real depth.I do wish that there was an easier way to mod this game, as that can sometimes make up a lot of the shortfalls in the graphics department, but the Devs chose to alter the format of the graphics files and having to covert simple .tga's is a complete pain in the ar_e.I guess the lesson here is actually finish the game BEFORE release, make it mod-able from the get go and, at least have it pass a simple Beta testing before throwing it out to the unsuspecting public. If that had happened this game could have gotten the praise that it actually does deserve. Love this game, so happy that I didn't buy it years ago when it came out, but I am so pleased that I finally took the chance and found an absolute gem.Do yourself a favour; get Sword of the Stars II: Enhanced Edition			",10,2,1,8,18,0,25

												This is the best game, that I've ever played. The game has a perfect balance between micro and macro management. The bugs, that was in the game, are now fixed, and the game is now a smooth experience. You shouldn't listen to all the negative reviews. Instead, try the game. It's awesome!			",21,0,1,1,4,2,8

It includes many features that were added from the original and only serve to obfuscate matters. None of these were asked for, needed or should have been included.

												I have a very difficult time pressing ""no,"" on my recommendation, because I really do want to like this game. I loved the first Sword of the Stars, and had a lot of faith in Kerberos, even with the botched launch of this title. With that being said, though, even as someone who enjoys grand strategy games, I can just not seem to get into this particular game even after racking up almost 90 hours with it. From an ergonomic standpoint, there are just far too many clicks to do any one thing. Rather than just selecting a fleet and sending it somewhere, you have to use a mission system which can only deploy a fleet to a designated system for a few turns at a time. It's impossible to simply park a fleet in a system and have it keep things safe, without also owning that system. Even then... it's a little frustrating. I get what that's supposed to accomplish; I understand the mechanic of linking deployment patterns to a ""real"" military, but I prefer the more abstracted version in the previous game. On top of that, station construction is completely tedious; most turns I skip it completely because it's simply boring to click through dozens of systems with several bases each, trying to remember which system had the weapons lab and which had the power plant lab, etc. Graphically, it's stunning in space combat. The ship design option is nice, though again a little tedious in some cases. Combat, like I said, looks good, but is vary annoying to run through because of the user interface and the massive scope of planetary systems -- sometimes it takes several turns to even encounter an enemy, and yet the game makes the combat take quite a long time. Randomized research is nice. Turn times are awful, even on an i7 Ivybridge. Make sure you've got something on Netflix to keep you busy.I'm sure a lot of people will try to say that I'm just not hardcore enough to like this game, but... Well, perhaps that's true. I don't have the patience to sort through many, many menus to do simple tasks, and I'm frustrated by wait times and the AI's inability to pose a challenge, along with the developers' very poor documentation (along with a surly community manager...). I will give it to them, in terms of spirit -- they tried very hard. Unfortunately, I think we're just going to have to wait for SOTS III for them to get back to the glory of the original game.

												This game could have been great all the gameplay is their to make this a fantastic sequel to sword of the stars. It retains the core gameplay from the original with a better interface and management mechanics. But it was not finished nor will it ever be. It does not even have an options menu, just a cobbled together launcher obviously made as a bandaid for a bad product. I was hoping that it would be fixed by now but it seems that resources were directed elsewhere and this game was abandoned.			",70,50,1,18,23,2,39

												One naturally expects the ""II"" after a game's name to denote some kind of improvement over a previous version.  In the case of Sword of the Stars II, that simply isn't the case.  This desiccated and soulless husk of a game is pretty much inferior to its predecessor in every way imaginable.I highly recommend purchasing the original SotS and leaving this ill-conceived atrocity on the dustbin.

												It's trash. I love 4x space strategy games and I tried to really give this one a shot but after 14 hours of struggling with this thing I just can't bring myself to give this any sort of a recommendation. On paper this game seems amazing with loads of great and complex elements but in reality it's all just horrendously designed trash. The menus, the UI, the battles, the Manager screens, the mechanics... literally EVERYTHING in this game is broken. I've got a mid to high range PC and this game plays at a silky smooth 4-7 fps in the Fleet Manager screen when I'm arranging a 6 ship fleet ffs. I once made the mistake of attacking an enemy's planet and ended up having to sit through a 3 fps battle for 14 minutes because of how horribly optimized this game is and because there's a complete lack of menus and other VERY BASIC things that can be found in any RTS made over the past decade (like an ESC menu, a Load Game option in the Campaign Menu, or even some camera hotkey options). This game has some of the worst camera controls I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. No WASD or arrow key camera movement (everything is done using the RMB) which is literally the most basic thing in any game, let alone an RTS.This thing is a rushed, buggy, poorly optimized, and completely half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥piece of sh*t. No tutorial, no explanations, no campaigns, and the list just goes on from there. I bought this thing on sale for $4.99 and I still feel pretty ripped off.			",162,14,2,13,19,2,77

												On the plus side, the tactical battles are very pretty and the way ships take damage is great.On the negative side, the strategic level is a mess. You can't just tell ships to go someplace, you have assign them to a fleet commanded by your limited number of admirals and generate a mission to go to a place. It's hard to describe exactly but it's very counter intutive and feels 'backwards'. You also can't ships in reserve on a fleet like in it's predecessor so even if you have a numerical advantage in ships since you're limited by what admirals can command. If you want to crush an enemy with your industrial might, the previously stated issues make it a logistical nightmare.If it was possible to mod this game into something more resembling the previous Sword of the Stars it'd be a pretty good game, as it stands I can't recommend it because it is simply so tedious to play.

												i ama amazed of the impressive number of negative review for this game.i admit it. it is not perfect. but is still a marvellous 4x game.one on the few that use the Total war sistem for the game: strategic map with turns, battle real time.the fact that you have to choose(unless you are korean) between manage your empire or lead and overview the combat is the major weak point of title like sins of a solar empire. the fact that the combat is scripted automatic or on turn is the major weakness of title like endless space.with this game you have all the time to manage your empire fleet and planet and then play the battles with your fleets.one of the things that make my brain explode is the ship costumization. you have 3 major class Cruiser, battleship, and leviatans. you can then change armaments power shield tipe or structure and modules creating your pesonal space ship for every situation. you can then save the model and mass produce it. you can name it. watch its performance. and when you discover new upgrade you can upgrade the ship or build from 0 a new type of ship. and not only ship. also hangar space station all that can be used in real time battle is upgradable. you will start with few options but with time you will have endless possibility.also the defense sistem is pretty good with auto defense from colonized planet(they shoot missile to target in a certain range) and placeble defense pre battle. so if you want to transform a planet in a forstress you can.also the fact that every race has his pesonal faster than light travel is very interesting. human for example can only use jump from point a to b using game setted road between planets. this limit the possibility of move because to arrive in certain area you must make several jumps. but is the fastest of all the others(if you don't count that of another race that use instant portal between a and b but you have to reach first point b with extremly slow travel and build the portal) and gave humans a huge advantage in early exploration. but this is only an example other race use others sistem so you have to learn it all if you want to efficiently guard your empire from invasions.in real time battle you have to choose the formation. the targets the movement of damaged ship. when to use special abilities or release yours drone from your carriers. you will learn to love your precius ships(you cn name each one) and will joy of their triumps and cry of their destruction. you can't blame the game. you choose what to reserch and how to build and equip the ships. you even control them. so it is very very rewarding when your new battleship destroy an entire group of enem cruiser and still hasn't a scratch. or if the battleship fail utterly you start to  question your project and immediatly crate a new version to correct the errors in the previus class.this game is gold. is really one of most complete challenging and well made game 4x i have ever seen.give it a chance. you will not be disappointed			",54,14,0,19,16,0,25

												I loved and still love Sots 1, and though I keep coming back to Sots 2, it is just frustrating! After all the time, the game is now in PreBeta or max Beta state. By no way has the game reached release version state.If it would come out now, in the current state, I would be still mad about Kerberos, but they could patch and improve the game... And I don't care about Paradox making pressure or what ever, I bought the game because of the opinion I had about Kerberos, didn't even realize that Paradox came into the boat at the time. Fact is, Kerberos sold something that they knew they couldn't deliver! As I know by now about Paradox being part of the deal, the blame is on both firms!The game did change compared to Sots 1, it took me a long time to accept that, but it's just that, I accepted the changes.What I can't accept are all the bugs that make the game unplayable, and the inconsistencies that shout BETA into my face.The major Problems that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me of:- Constant crashes to desktop (mars engine error -> probably an internal error to the engine, which may even be a design error, thus not easily fixed)- Savegames may become and will become corrupt, could be due to crashes or what ever...- Wait time in between turns, hello? Even SWIV on Amiga published in 1991 managed to eliminate Load Screens by preloading data during play time. A little calculation would be acceptable but the current state is ridicule.- LOA fleet count is just wrong... As the game moves on, the count for LOA ships just explodes, bankrupting you in the process. One may revert a cube of 8 ships, to reduce the count ingame from 8 up to 100++. Strangely I found no mention about this one anywhere?Bad design decisions or balance issues: - Extended Range ships only got slighty more range than an Armor ship (both with camel modules). - Estimated mission times off - Impossibility to chain missions - GUI:     Planet overview, way too small, cannot be ordered by planets, but only by systems > click each and every system!     Keyboard shortcuts missing     text truncated with no scroll bars     Fleet overview, clicking a fleet will not focus on the fleet, same is true for some events like pirate attacks - Non customizable turn review (Hiver fleet casted successfully > uncheck, mission X finished > check, notification on planet infrastructure 100% > check) - Unable to export / import ship designs > first turn without prototyp cost takes time.That's just what came into my mind as I was typing these lines, I won't put up a beta test report here, as it's the wrong place and patching is over!

												Original Review: Not RecommendedEPIC FAILURE!!! Totally broken release.  They released a beta, no kidding.  The beta was the release version and the 'update' which was suppose to be the final is just a later beta version.  The options menu doesn't even work.  This game is beyond broken.  This is the worst game release I have ever, I mean ever, seen.  Stay away from this product.  It's horrible.My Score: 0/10 (Unplayable)Updated Review: RecommendedWell, they fixed it.  A year after release it is finally beginning to be the title we all hoped and paid for.  It is entertaining, fun, and has strategic depth.  The best of the original SOTS has finally returned with much improved graphics and gameplay.  I have recently revisited playing this title after it has been fixed and can now honestly recommend this title.  It is fun for strategic junkies and should be worth the money now.  If you loved the first, you will easily get 100 hours of entertainment out of this one and that means it's worth it.My Score: 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to start... I had the highest hopes for this game when it was announced. Then it finally came out! The graphics were awesome. But the gameplay... and the bugs. I tried many times since then to get into this game. When it first came out they patched it like crazy and I had hope. I have tons of patience when it comes to things like this. But after months and months, I was still getting CTD's, game hangs, and slow downs. Then I put the game away for awhile, more than a year. My friends all decided to try it one last time a couple of months ago. And we still couldn't even play a couple turns in multiplayer without the game crashing one of us out. I usually don't write reviews for things I don't enjoy because I know some poeple out there have great fun with this game. But from my experience, I have given up on ever enjoying this game. But heres to hoping my preorder  money will go to a SOTS III or hell, even a SOTS I HD remake or something. BUYER BEWARE on this one unfortunately.			",65,10,1,10,6,0,31

												Unfortunately I'm not even sure the mostly negative reviews capture just how bad this is.  The game has a variety of bugs and glitches right up to shuting down with no errors or anything.  The UI is poorly designed and difficult to make sense of, and even once you figure it out getting the information you want to moving between planets/ships/etc is cumbersome.  There is NOT tutorial of any sort, nothing leads you through learning the game, and the manual isn't real good it either.  After watching an hour video on youtube that repleatedly pointed out failures of the game it still wasn't entirely clear how to play fully because even veterans had no idea what somethings did.  The game is needlessly complex in areas it shouldn't be which detracts from any enjoyment you might otherwise get.  There is no information anywyhere in the UI to actually explain things like the tech tree items or econmy impacts so you operate in the dark constantly.  Combat encounters make almost no sense at all and time limits on combat is the kicker.  Missions and conlonization don't even work smoothly as it's unclear why fleets seem to vanish for a turn or two after a mission, and planets never seem to finish colonizing for some reason.  Other features simply don't work and there is no indication why.  I was hoping to glean a few hours enjoyment out of my money but that just didn't happen, it was all frustration and confusion and disapointment.			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

												The game, even after all these years, is still full of bugs.  I've played a ton of the original SotS, and actually stopped mid game to give this one a shot, which I picked up for cheap on the winter sale.  I've convinced more than a few friends to buy the original, but I can't recommend this.Its positives:Tactical combat is better in many ways, worse in a fewMultiple planets aren't the pain they usually are to have in a game like thisBetter system of handling damage in the gameNew techBetter graphicsThe negatives:That nice new tactical combat is hopelessly mired in a bad combination of bugs and the fleet system, which basically makes you fight the interface to get stuff done.  You'll have interesting experience like not being able to send a fleet from the closest star system to colonize, but only from ones half way across the galaxy, or have you invasion, listed as lasting 30 turns, mysteriously stop after 4, and because of the fleet system, you can't order your ships to turn around.It has a very steep learning curve, is not balanced in terms of things like random events, the AI isn't very smart, and the game does a poor job of communicating what is going on to the player.  I wish they'd fix the game.  It could have been great but for a couple of dubious design decisions, and lots of bugs.It's fun for awhile, but eventually you'll get sick of fighting the game more than your opponent.  Also, if you love extra layers of micromanagement, play the Loa, where you'll be continuously creating and destroying fleets, than making tiny fleets to send all on the same turn and reassemble someplace else, and try to figure out how to navigate the semi-functional battle manager, which is very bugged at least with the them.

												This is a really hard game for me to write a review for. The original came at me out of nowhere and hooked me deeply. I played through all the expansions and replayed it many many times greatly enjoying it. Then a sequel was announced. I was over the moon. So rarely in recent years have i felt so eager to play a sequel as this one. Then came one of the top 3 worst pc releases i can recall in my long history of gaming. I wont go over it , lets just say all the love in the world was not enough to get me to keep playing it.  I then periodically played it over the next year realising quite quickly this was not going to be a quick fix. I have recently played it with the free expansion and finally got something akin to what i was hoping for. There is one major letdown for me tho( many many small ones...) To play a 6 or more player map WILL result in unbelievable turn times, so much so that I took to reading an ebook between turns after a few hundred turns.  I was up to a minute plus after a few hundred turns, ie 60 mins of waiting per 60 turns... I had a black edition AMD machine 6 cores 3.8ghz, 16gb ddr3 1600mhz ram, ssd install drive and a £380 graphics card. In the top few percent of 6million steam users and yet this game was close to unplayable on large maps. Who the hell was it designed for? As the majority with dual core processors in the 3ghz range and 4gb ram must love 1v1 i guess. So.. I very begrudgingly give it a thumbs up (Edit- see below for change) for the dedication shown in trying to patch it on an up until recently regular schedule. The potential for this game is outstanding, it has not sadly reached that potential. Ill still be checking back on this periodically which says something in itself.Edit 06/06/14 - Apparently as of January 2014 from what I can piece together from the bits and pieces on the kerberos forum, paradox are no longer funding development of this game and kerberos are directing all feedback/questions to paradox directly. I will therefore change this review to a thumbs down as it is unfinished and will never reach a finished state. What a tragic shame from start to finish.Kerberos have stated that at this time they have no plans for a sots3....			",190,31,1,59,36,2,77

												Buy SOTS 1 instead of SOTS 2.  SOTS 2 added more customization but the customizations add little to gameplay.  The game doesn't feel complete.  For example, the Gardner dreadnaught seems like it should have something to do with terraforming planets.  If you build a station on it and move it to a planet, that planet will be attacked by Protean Pods.  The Gardner has no abilities other than movement and the Protean Pods seem to do nothing.  It feels like the devs left a lot of unfinished concepts in the game.  Games seem to take a lot longer than SOTS 1 as well.			",102,37,0,40,12,0,57

												First off: RUN AWAY!The general concept of the game is great and i loved the ship building and designing but there are sooooo many bugs here that you could sink a Dreadnaught with them. I enjoyed the early stages but when you progress further on in the game, a turn can take around 20 minutes to process.\Combat was enjoyable but the formation setup system is broken. Research can sometimes lead into dead ends and this can be enjoyable unless you end up without any kind of fast firing CWIS system (forgot the names, it has been a while). Iff you really want to try the game, wait until its on 75% sale at least.Pro:- Extensive ship designing- lots of research- a lot of diverse factions- combat can be intenseCon:- Bugs, lots of them- Gaudy ship colours- performance drops- combat is on a timer- prepare to crash- no support for windows 104/10 Unrealized potential gone to waste ",115,23,0,44,29,0,47

												This game has so much potential. I LOVE IT. it will never be finished though, ALOT of the features and ""core"" elements of the game are not present, optimization is very bad, LOOOONG turn times, STUPID A.I. even MP has crashes and the host is the only one who can use precombat features..... as much as i love this game its dead. there is a bunch of drama between kerberose production and paradox. Kerberose released a third of a game(look at change logs) and paradox was not happy imagine that. they paid for a finished product and what they were given was a game that could not even load the main menu at release. Paradox cut funding, kerberose patched a sinking ship as well as they could and released the xpack for free in hopes of getting more $$$$ it did not work. now Kerberose has moved on to android games and simpler games.

												While the game is not in the greatest state, I would like to say that their are a few gleaming aspects of it that let it shine.The visuals and voices in this game are great and the graphics alone took a huge step from SoTS 1. The gameplay while slower than the first is more realistic of what one would be in reality. However, I must admit the negatives outweigh the positives in this game.The bugs when released along with the low framerates have been fixed, but the AI in the game is all but none existant. They rarely do anything impactful if they do anything at all. Another major flaw I have found in the game is if you leave random encounters on hive queens, if not taken care of quickly, will slowely take of the map and nearly every one of your planets will be under attack constantly ruining the fun of the game. I give the game a 6.5 out of 10 only because i loved the first game. This game had a lot of potential and it was sad to see it fall.			",81,9,0,5,15,2,16

												There's a good game in here somewhere, I think. I loved the original Sword of the Stars, and II seems to be something I would love - but I just can't wrap my head around the new Fleets system for some reason. I like it, in theory, but it just feels so incredibly arcane that I can't bring myself to play the game any length of time - and this comes from someone who has sunk hundreds of hours into Dwarf Fortress. If you're willing to sink a lot of energy into figuring out how to actually play the game you might enjoy it, but I'd rather just play one of the many other games that I know are good.

Some interfaces don't work right, other features are still broken, diplomacy is mostly an afterthought, and you'll still experience the odd crash to desktop. With all that said, once you learn the interface and how the fleet system works it can still be an enjoyable experience.

												This game was really disappointing for me personally.  I really enjoyed Sword of the Stars, and when I bought it I was hoping for a graphical update, some gameplay polish and maybe some new mechanics.  What was delivered was a very different thing.Overall the game feels like it was in development, and the team got most of the way through making it.  To the point where they had a functional game, and what remained to be done was improving the efficiency of the graphics engine, fix a number of small, but very annoying bugs, work on balancing, and overall give the game the much needed polish a quality game needs.  Then at this point they deployed it.  This is not an actually complete game, it is what you'd start testing with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since I'm a huge fan of the first SOTS, I keep playing this game trying to find something positive about it, but fail everytime.Main points why I'm dissapointed about this game:AI-players are a joke.AI-combat in general is a joke, especially against another human opponent. I mean, a child could do better...You have less options about doing bizarre stuff like in the first SOTS.You have less options to customize with the maps.Overall: Do not buy this game unless they fix it (which is unlikely), or they make it so that we, the fans can mod it to work... PLEASE DEVS... Steam workshop maybe? This game has so much potential.

												Its not really a bad game, more like a precious gem in need of some polishing.The bad:-Lots of bugs, although plenty have been fixed with various patches but many more still remain, none are really gamebreaking though.-Unoptimized. At later turns, 500-900+, you'll see a substantial lag when ending turns, i've had turns taking 5-10 mins to cycle. Also it doesn't run well on most PC setups, even high end rigs, its all in the game coding, engine and optimization.-Cut content. Its very obvious. Some features are implemented half complete, certain basic features are missing, we also have content and assets in game that do nothing.-Too combat & war oriented. Personally i like having a good mix of empire management, combat, diplomacy, trading etc. SotsII main focus is war.-SotsII has flamboyant lore and backstory but lacks a full fledge story mode or campaign which is a shame.The good:-Gfx are amazing, for its time. The ship models, laser beams, projectiles, armor, modules and whatever visual assets and effects are stunning and beautiful. The different designs & styles created by the devs fit perfectly into the lore & game, very pleasing to the eyes.-Music, SotsII has arguably one of the best OST though its has a very war-like theme.-Combat. Its a turn based game but with real time tactics combat. Combat is one of the bigger strengths of SotsII. Although its small scale tactics but theres reasonable amount of tactical elements like formations, armor/shield facing, firing arc, special manoeuvres etc. Granted half the time i'm in cinematic mode just spectating the gorgeous space battles.-Ship design & customization. Very modular, flexible, balanced and makes a lot of sense. Its also one of the few space games that take scale seriously. A Dreadnought is visually much, much bigger than a Cruiser while a Leviathan is exceedingly massive making Cruisers look like tiny fighters and fighters look small like missiles. Goes the same for weapon and module loadout. A Cruiser might have 5-10 turrets of various sizes(PD,S,M etc) while a Leviathan has a realistic whopping 70-80 turrets. All turrets have their own targetting, physics, firing arc etc which makes combat very tactical.-Tech tree, this is a hit or miss. Personally i love the RNG Tree format, it forces the player to adapt and get creative if you get locked out of certain progression path, also makes every playthrough unique. But since its RNG it can get frustrating especially in a multiplayer game, you might end up being locked out from majority of the techs and have to resort to hardcore salvaging.-Distinct and unique faction/races. Both lore wise and empire & combat mechanics. Very vibrant backstory for each of the races/factions. They all have their own special FTL method of travel, various strengths and weakness, very different playstyles too etc etc.			",318,23,0,84,31,3,100

												First of all, I fully understand all negative reviews. I have rarely seen such a badly documented game. The description / explanation of critical features are either incomplete or totally missing (the official manual gets you started – but not more). A clear NO GO for an average gamer.Having written that: why do I recommend buying this game at all?Because after having spent really a lot of time to understand the game mechanics on my own (basically as part of a separate game), SoSt II (enhanced edition) turned out to be the best 4X Science Fiction game I have ever played. It even beats “Sins of a Solar Empire” (meaning a lot for those who know it). As far as the depth and complexity is concerned it can be best compared to “Hearts of Iron” (the latest versions).Yes, the game crashes from time to time, but it is still playable thanks to auto saving before and after a combat. With my current HW configuration I can usually play around 10 – 50 turns without any issues – at highest settings. For beginners, the AI is absolutely sufficient. After you have achieved some game experience, I recommend playing primarily in a two player mode (without AI). Diplomacy is certainly not a strength of this game. However, the combat system with all the tactical possibilities is just awesome. Also, the fully 3D star map is unique with several different ways (drives) to explore. Designing ships and building up a reasonable economy is fun. In addition, the Tech tree is breathtaking (just note that a lot of technologies you find in other games from the beginning, have to be developed first – adding massive functionality and a lot of features you are not aware of at the beginning).Bottom Line: an absolutely great game marketed in a very bad way. Only to be recommended for people who are willing to go the extra mile required to understand the undocumented features of the game (including some basic game mechanics).  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has the best tactical battle system of all other 4x space games as well as the most innovative races and tech tree. However there it ends. Everything else is half finished and not polished, riddled with bugs. I still spent countless hours in this game, just for the fleet battles. :) Only recommeded for die hard 4x fans.

												Yeah okay.  Changing this to a ""Yes"" from a ""No"".Why did I start with no?  Well it has to do with threshold of pain.  Games shouldn't surprise players and then say 'well you should have read the manual' and you can read the full details of ""No"" way down there somewhere.Reasons for ""Yes""?  Because after you get past the surprises and understand the game - I think there's a good - maybe even awesome game in here.  Here are some pluses:+ Massive tactical star battles that are player controlled.  Take that GalCiv.+ Very deep and randomized tech tree.  This means some games will have more severe handicaps than others and you'll have to make due even when some tech isn't available.+ Customizable ships.~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ancient reasons for ""No"" below ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This review was written to be sent on a time machine to the past to the ""has not yet bought SotS2"" younger, more innocent version of ""huminado"":  don't buy it.And it's not because this isn't a great game.  Don't get me wrong - I like this game.  I like what the game is good at doing.  But I can't recommend it.  It's only to prevent myself that painful moment of having buyer's regret and believing I've been ripped off.This will happen to most people who buy this game.  It might not be justified.  If they read the manual or the forums they might find out the game is fine, or they might run into other issues.But I know that feeling of buyer's remorse.  If I can avoid it, even at the price of never playing a great game which has confusing surprises - I will.To sum this review up: this game does not meet current standards of quality for TBS.  There's a very good chance players will run into problems which could easily be avoided if the game were finished.  In my case, if I had read the whole manual, I might have avoided an issue.  But I don't expect anyone to ever read a manual - I expect games to be intuitive on their own.If you want the details, read my blog post on the anti-wiener game design pattern here: http://clientserverhell.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-anti-wiener-pattern.html------ Further observation ------The longer I play the more it becomes clear reading the manual is not optional.  And some details are missing in the manual.  For example, the term PD is never explained, neither in the game, nor the manual, nor the wiki.  If you don't know what that term is (and maybe some people don't) - then you'll have to ask around.I haven't played long enough to say, but this sort of missing detail doesn't mean bad game design, but it does mean assumptions are made about the player's level of expertise before they open the box.  It shouldn't discourage anyone from trying though.  I still have to give it thumbs down - at least until I see the game in a state that is more friendly to new players.			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												Sadly...I must agree with the many posts before me. I bought this game as The Lords of Winter iteration and stayed with it through all the patches. There are some epic 3D battles to be had here - and this game mechanic is awesome - but many areas remain bland...and that makes for a bland galaxy. The star systems are just not interesting to explore or colonize - as it is just a matter of ramming as many colony ships back and forth as you can. Because the eXplore portion is weak, it makes the eXpand portion also bland and boring. This galaxy is not alive in any substantial way.Pluses: (1) Multi-player tactical is fun. (2) Multi-player strategy is OK. Spend your money on funding a team with the real posibility of completing a better 4X space game.			",3,0,0,1,4,0,17

												Having played Sword Of the Stars I felt this should be there right next to it.They did a fair job at complicating systems, extending the game as it was, and with commanders now having experience and getting promoted as well as ship modules that further define a ships capabilities they did all right.Unfortunately they took out the tutorials, which, with this new interface they probably should have extended upon, the encyclopedia is full of spelling errors and looks as though its a fan-production (or at least I hope it is, having seen Star Trek Enterprise it seems all so familiar) that they decided to implement into the game, and then there is the Research screen, which I always had a problem with, even in the first version. The having to confirm some aspects to research but not others... I'm affraid to touch any slider in the game now just because there might be a hidden confirm button I'll need to find first...not the kind of easter eggs I was hoping for.I loved the first game, but I'm not sure what I should be calling...this...On the up-side, I haven't experienced a single crash people are (still) going on about.

												There's no shortage of good 4X experiences out there, and this game just isn't one of them.The game is an abject technical failure. It was completely unplayable on its release, and it's still riddled with performance issues and frequent crashes, even after the developer has finished updating it.The game had good ideas, but the way in which they were implemented ended up generating way too much micromanagement, without actually expanding the range of meaningful choices available to the player. Star system management takes more time each turn now, not because you're making difficult choices about how to invest your resources, but because the game will punish you if you don't spend enough time fiddling with the dials.The core gameplay of the first Sword of the Stars is still there, but it's buried beneath poor game design choices and technical issues that should've been fixed. All in all, that game is just a better experience than this one.Its current price as of this writing is about half of its launch price, which is still more than it is worth. I would maybe suggest picking it up for under five dollars if it's on a generous sale, and you're already tired of the first SotS. Otherwise, steer clear.			",141,51,0,66,22,1,50

												This game is really what everyone wants in a 4x game. unforunately even after all this time and so many attempts to play this game I never finish a game. Why Because after somewhere between 400-500 turns you end up with a very slow slow experience. It had it all too It had the great tech tree. It had amazing ship design, It had a awesome looking universe. The combat is a bit lack luster. Unforunately I would not recommend it to someone wanting to play a 4x game.4x games appear to be were new people develop bad games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SOTS II can and, is in my opinion a great game. But for the average person, this game is just not something to purchase, even if  it has improved leaps and bounds since launch.There are still way to many issues, mainly how confusing it can be to a new player. The biggest issue I have is turn times, especially in bigger games, and when turns get into the triple digits.Now don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoy this game, and I would love to tell people to pick it up and just try, but I can't.

												I've been in the market for a good space 4X so i can have a few beers and watch my armada go pew pew across the galaxy. I didn't have a terribly good experience with the Sword of the Stars but the sequil was on sale so i thought I'd give it a try.I've started a couple of games with different races but the game is so impenatrably slow that I've never made it far enough in any of them to judge whether the wall of poorly explained mechanics actually means much in the grand scheme of the game. I feel like the game is trying to convey a ton of data to me but doing so in the form of color codings and submenus and nested interfaces that mean performing simple tasks means hunting through icons turn after turn. I was expecting a graphics update, I was not expecting an interface and gameplay downgrade.I'm sure that about 30 hours in you've probably memorized all the quirks of the system well enough to make the game playable, but still have my doubts it would be enjoyable. Guess I'll keep looking.			",173,23,3,31,34,1,70

												Bottom line is they strayed in the complete opposite direction that made the original SOTS so incredibly amazing. Simplicity.What made SOTS so incredibly enjoyable is that all I had to do was research, build ships, have some wicked space battles and occasionally send a colony ship to a planet and forget about it for 50 turns.They've made the best part of the game (space battles) so incredibly annoying to get into that it's just not worth playing anymore.I would have been in awe and payed $40 for this if all it was was a graphic update package for original SOTS, but all the extra interface garbage makes it unenjoyable.

												Get it and don't miss it! Buy it on sale if you can't afford it otherwise or are wary of the reviews, but if you love epic 4x games with incredible detail, this game will blow your mind.Play it as an adventure in discovering an immense and complex world. Play it to support the franchise, one of the most amazing 4x series ever conceived. Play it in hopes that this gem of a game, this monument to the dreams and vision of its developers, will continue to get the last 10% of development it needs to finally become the-most-amazing-4x-game-ever. Unique thingies:1. Dynamic Government Types, assigned based on economic, population, and military decisions, each government type with its own set of bonuses and restrictions2. Automated empire population behaviors, spurred on with indirect economic stimulation, cause your citizens to act independently to colonize and set up trade routes3. Fully rendered 3D ships with individually targetable sections, allowing advanced tactical warfare options (sniper weapons, heavy ballistic weapons, powerful beam weapons, drones, complex ordinance, you name it!)4. Unique races, each with their own different FTL drive types. Different FTL technology significantly affects exploration and strategic warfare.5. Random tech tree allows for a unique game each time6. Research an A.I. to help your empire, but beware, it can TURN AGAINST YOU!! (Whaaat?!)7. Randomized ""Grand Menaces"" (think ""Borg"" level galactic invaders) and encounters that make the game epicThere's a loooong back story on this game - an epic and confusing story of publisher vs developer. In the end, there were a lot of unhappy die-hard lovers of the original Sword of the Stars (an amazing game in its own right) who were severely off-put by what could only be called an unfinished game when it plopped out on release day. Because of this, you will no doubt be inundated by massive amounts of negative posts in forums and reviews. That being said however, from release forward, the developers continued to put out a fairly steady stream of patches and significant effort was made to bring this game up to ""release"" level by 2014. Unfortunately, this is where the story apparently ends as the publisher, after years slow improvement, decided to stop further progress on this game. Which is truly sad. Not sad, tragic. You can see the love for this game in the developers' forums, but politically (and I suppose somehow, legally) they no longer actively contribute to further patches. Some have hinted they will work on the product in their own time, unpaid, but very little has been seen to this end in recent time.So where does this leave us? The game is lavish. It's complex. It's advanced. But you can feel overwhelmed because, simply put, the user interface just isn't where it should be. Tooltips are missing, documentation is limited (and in a game this complicated, detailed documentation is necessary to understand how things interact). Sword of the Stars seems to have always emphasized a fun-to-play engine on top of a complicated set of features. The player has (in the original Sword of the Stars game anyway) no immediate need to ""understand"" how all these factors work together to play - just set a slider or push a button and things ""just work."" That was okay in the first game, where your planet development and trade routes just made sense and were easy to understand graphically. But soooo much has been added to the sequel that it's mind bending to even try to guess what repercussions your actions might have. Browsing through the developer forums you will still get a sense that Kerberos intended things to ""just work"" and often you will see posts chastising users for asking detailed questions about mathematical formulas used to determine trade profit or population growth or morale, but without the necessary game feedback of what your choices in the game actually DO to your empire, it's hard not to want answers to the underlying logical questions of what's going on. Still, Sword of the Stars is a totally unique series in an often sterile world of 4x games. It's ability to successfully merge tactical and strategic elements, with micro and macro management, and truly glorious 3D battles is so amazingly singular that you owe it to yourself to try this game. Few games allow you to actually implement strategic warfare to the point that it's possible to win against a superior enemy by focusing weaker units on strategic enemy ship components (each 3D element, turret, engine, etc is individually targetable), hiding in asteroid shadows, or annexing by indirect political power that it's without hesitation that I earnestly recommend this game.

												I've now played almost a week solid of Sword of the Stars II with 4x of my friends.  It crashed only once, when it did we launched the game back up and continued without another problem.  When people say this game doesnt work, they need to upgrade to Windows 10.  With WIN X the game is stable, the issue that causes crashes in Windows 7 is a memory permission access error trying to write to the memory.  I expect this is the cause of most users crashes.The game is absolutely awesome, if you have ever played Birth of the Federation this game is a worthy successor.  There is an incredible depth.Most reviews here talk about the game being buggy, upgrade to Windows 10 and thats not the case at all.Many reviews here talk about the lack of tutorial..... Read the manual when your on the toilet, its the best way to learn.This game has a varied and immense level of possible strategy, the battles and ship design modules are fun and rewarding. I look forward to many more hours of this game to come :-)Enjoy!Th'OrN			",317,43,10,41,48,2,60

												When i first played SOTS i loved it, it was a game that evolved to become a promising series of expansions with the possiblity of  rivialing ""Civilisations"". I'm not sure how the Angel fell but Crikey, it hit the pavement hard and then fell into hells fan. For some reason the completely re-constructed the turn-by-turn system into something so simple it was near incomprehendible to the old SOTS players. Whilst removing some races individualism entirely invaliding the reason to have ever purchase the original expansions (also no more space squids *sadface*) Whilst adding a new race that was the rebellious and dreaded ""AI"" from the original. This game is an absoloute disgrace, as it takes progress from the original sideways, rather than forward.Good points-Still retains the awesome designs-Awesome (if confusing) star systemsBad points-More space whales required-Virtually no Lore to AI race-lack of explained game mechanics    -------  / (0)_(0)\        \-/        /\Sad stick figure is feeling sad :(			",74,4,0,5,10,0,18

												This game had a horrid release, and has committed a great sin in the fact that many of the core mechanics of the first game have been completely and unnecessarily changed. SotS 1 needed some things major, those being a better diplomacy/ economy system and an easier time to be able to get into the game as many of the tutorials are rubbish. Toss in some current gen graphics and you have a fantastic game. What happened is the opposite, given a poor UI, a way to complex system for building a single damn ship, and making what should be simple aspects of the game into a multitasking nightmare. If you want something fun, try SotS one. You can still play it through Hamachi direct connecting via lan. I have heard people call SotS an ugly girl with a great personality, but with that personality lost on its sequel, theres no reason to waste your time trying to get to know her anymore.

												3/24/2014I currently have over 1,000hours in this game.Here a list of things within the game on a scale of 1-10Individual race design- 8/10 (each race still feels completely unique and fresh like they did in the first game)Artificial Intelligent race design- 10/10 (this was actually done flawlessly and very unique compared to other artificial intelligent races created in the same and even other sci-fi genres. It's a very fresh new look on AI playable races)Story- 2/10 (there is no story, other than the lore you get from either the forums or within the encyclopedia their really nothing else.)Tech Tree- 9/10 (the randomized tech forest with several branches and seven overall main weapon types, no matter what game you play against AI or other Human Opponents, the odds of running exactly the same weapon types is very slim after you reach turn 100)Unit Health vs DPS -9/10 (basically this mean how unit health is dealt vs the weapon damage that it takes. Unlike most Turn Based Strategy games SotS 2 contains a Real Time combat, so it already starts off with an advantage verse other turn based strat games. However with the inclusion of the ship matrix system which mimics physical armor depth and resistance. The game surpasses even the most advanced real time strategy game. In fact I would have to say this is the first time I scene a videogame of anytype properly model a vehicle or units armor in a way that it actually makes logical sense. However there are some downsides, for starters I don't feel weapons do enough DPS to the armor matrix in many cases some high end weapons just wont kill an enemy unit. In fact their are very few weapons that do enough damage to completely penetrate a CR armor matrix in one shot even at end game. On the flip side their are tons of weapons that are left ""obsolete"" once you reach Leviathans or even Dreadnoughts with AA so all around the matrix system is amazing, but weapon balancing could be better. Battles really do feel slow in many cases unless your focus firing with all your units. Leaves a lot of strategy left in the background to pick up dust.)Game Length- 7/10 (It is a Turn Based Strategy Game, so it obvious that a single match could last several days if not weeks depending on size and level of strategy of both the player and the Ai. So if I go on just length this game will get a 10/10 in this category way to easily, just because of its genre alone. However the problem I run into is the ""fun"" factor, in fact I can't really blame this particular game for this, since so many turn based games run into this problem. ""The Clean Up Turns"" around turns 200 to 300 you should if you a modest player and your playing at 100% eco and research with standard starting systems and 4 players, you will run into the clean up turns within this turn bracket. Basically Clean Up Turns is when your literally doing nothing, you have overpowered your opposition and steamrolling through their systems, it just gets boring the AI makes no attempt at counter attacking and even on the off chance they do, they don't succeed. Now verse a human player you will generally run into the point during this process where the Human player just quits. This is a good thing as it completely eliminates the Clean Up Turns. The Ai really needs an option at some point where they just cant go on any longer and they succeed from the game, whether this should cause the Ai's systems to separate into their provinces and become multiple Ai players or not, just to make it more interesting and stop the boredom of this clean up turns or just have it end the game all together. Either way something needs to be done about this, because reaching this point to often is the reason why I left so many other turn based strategy games. Just finishing the match is not fun after a certain point.)Textures and Effects- 9/10 (the game is beautiful it really is)Re-playability- 8/10 (after 1000 hours into this game, yes it has a ton of re-playability. Otherwise I wouldn't have so many hours into the game. Even though it not being worked on 24/7 by its development team, it doesn't have to be. Randoms alone increase re-playability exponentially. On top of that modding ""which I do a lot of"" makes the game seem dynamic and different every time you change or add something new to its already complicated but fun dynamics which are in place and very solid. It could use some help though, like an expansion or two in order to mesh everything together and create a completely solid slap for modders to build from in order to create more dynamic events for the sandbox matches which are very much almost always enjoyable.)I would give the total score of this game....8/10that would be my final verdict after factoring in everything I said above. The game is good in single player, its multi player can be a bit buggy still, but people do play it and have fun (although it can be a hassle)  so all around the game is worth its weight in USD (considering the USA economic issues though.... I think the game will always be worth its weight in USD... haha I make bad jokes), but yea it is worth the buy. Pick it up if you like Turn Based Strategy games.. or just like ships with pretty lasers shooting each other, both are good reasons!			",51,4,0,14,12,0,18

												8/10Note: Review based on enhanced edition of game which is much improved over original release. Overview: Sots2 is a grand 4x stratergy game that is increadibly deep and complex.  You have to grow and run your empire, controlling trade, colonization, stimulus, research, ship design and fully 3D, fully controllable space combat. Ship design and weapon placement makes a big difference in combat, and tactics, direction etc is very important in space combat.  Those looking for a deep strategic game with fully controllable Space Combat will not go wrong here. Pros: Very deep, lots of control over empire from stimulus, colonization, research, base construction and upgrades. Unlike many other in the genre, space combat is fully controllable.  You control everything and controlling if your ships focus on broadside or frontal attacks makes a big difference, as does how you outfit your ship and where you place your weapons.  Overall very satisfying. The inclusion of an ingame chat system that allows you to speak to other players is very useful for getting player advice.  Also, the game looks great graphically. Cons: Complete lack of tuturial is a major annoyance.  I had to watch a (highly recommended) youtube tutorial to make heads or tails of the game.  Considering how complex it is, can be very hard for new players to get into it.  Also, the game still suffers from crashes.  Final con is that Diplomacy is not that well implemented, which is fine for those warmongers among us, but those that want to play a more diplomatic game might be dissapointed.Summary: If you want a deep, good looking 4x will excellent combat, then look not further than Sots2.

												Despite the bad review it got almost a year ago, This game is actually EXTREMELY good as it is now in the condition it was suppose to be at launch.  It's an awesome blend of turn based strategy for the galaxy map, and real time ship to ship combat where you can target specific areas on opposing ships to disarm them for instance.  although the game is very good, it is also very complex and therefore some people may not enjoy it due to it's complexity, however if you enjoy 4x games, this is for sure one to pick up.Nominated			",223,21,2,45,35,1,60

												Really fun turn-based strateegy with realtime tactial battles. It has one of the biggest research systems I've ever seen and each tree gives unique guns, armor or modules to customize your empire's ships with. Do keep in mind that there are occasional bugs, but nothing major enough to ruin the experience, just little annoying things.			",428,47,6,63,68,0,108

												This game is an abomination against all that is good.Many people may have fond memories of Sword of the Stars I, which is a fun game.  Sadly, this game will only serve to tarnish your memories of fun and joy and replace them with anger, sadness, and a sense of puzzlement as to what could have possibly possessed the developers to make such a steaming pile of feces.The game is filled with....curious...design decisions.  Such as the opening techs taking 30+ turns to research.  Or the fact that designing a new warship requires you to destroy half your treasury to change one gun.  Neither of these problems were present in the original game,  The UI is confusing and bad, and even the free expansion pack does not serve to improve it.Avoid this game and go play the original game or Galactic Civilizations.

												Consider this game if you're looking for a 4x space title that is a bit deeper than something like, say, Endless Space. Customization of ships is amazing, letting you select weapons for your ships (from 3 different categories -- energy, ballistic, and missiles -- and then there are types -- Beams, Pulse Lasers, Plasma Cannons for Energy, etc.) and putting YOU in charge of placing them on where you need them -- no ""lol I'm gonna add ten Level 5 cannons, k I'm done designing!"" And yes, you will need to pay attention to this sort of stuff -- combat is 3D rendered on a semi-2D plane (there are 3 different vertical planes ships can go to to avoid collision), and weapon placement matters.Don't mind the Metacritic score, it comes from reviews from when the game was a terrible, buggy mess. It has been much improved over the past year, and is more than playable.			",439,80,8,66,47,6,71

												The game would have done so much better if they took the first game, updated the graphics and then sold it. Sure they would have got flak for that, but as someone who really enjoys playing SOTS 1, I REALLY hate SOTS 2. When I have to spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to move my fleet from star A to star B, let alone how to move it once I get into a battle, you know you have problems with the UI. I am a person who can start a game up, figure out how to play it as I go, and generally encounter no problems. It is RARE that I can't figure something out. In this game, like I havbe already said, can't even figure out how to move my fleets. The worst part is is that there is no tutorial!!!!!! So there I was, excited about the sequel, and spending over an hour trying to figure out the game. So when I got stumped completely I was like, ""okay, let me save the game and then go to the main menu to start the tutorial, I am probably only making this harder than it has to be by completely missing some stupid button!"". So I got to the main menu and discovered there was no tutorial. In frustration I quit and went to play SOTS 1 which is simple and intuitive. I mean how hard can it be to put a button in that says, move fleet?Anyways, this game was terrible, and I hate to say that because after I learned a few basic controls, the ideas they where trying to implement where actually pretty good.

Windowed Fullscreen isn't equal to your resolution.#3. There's a scenarios button with no scenarios.#4. No tutorial. #5. Weapons have their stats in graphs rather than numerical statistics so I have no idea what anything does.I literally can't play this due to the poor design choices of the developers, and could never recommend anyone else playing this.

												After more than 2 years worth of patches after initial release, this is still unplayably buggy. It's also obvious that some of the intended features don't work the way they are supposed. I found that in battle most of the time my worst enemy was not the enemy ships, but the crappy user interface, and the broken time acceleration mechanic. All that potential for a great game is lost because of incredibly bad programming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I heard people saying that it is bad and ain't worth it. But, if it was, I would not have played this for more than 700 hours!!!And here is why i say the game is enjoyable:For starters, this is a strategy based turn game where you must customize your own ships with all avalable. (Unfortunatly the game offers no in-game tutorials so either you find on your own and experiment and do mistakes or you go on YouTube to find every tutorials.)Game is fairly well balanced, always read what the race is good with when you choose your starting race. Each and every one of them have their pros and cons in researches, travels, weapons and so on.The game requires a lot of stuff but on personal opinion it requires  the following things: Cunning, viciousness, tactics and a good computer that will hold the game. on personal note the game can be frustrating with reaserch failiures and economy progress but the game is overall enjoyable.one of the cons that happens to me and most players the game can crash (but what game dosent crash much in general?)Hope my review is helpful enough for everyone whyo doubts on buying the game.If anything, send me a message at my profile and I will answer your questions as best as I can Enjoy the game and good luck			",30,0,0,6,9,0,34

												After many of the bugs and system issues seem to be fixed the game worked well. lots of time went into making a more detailed and visually pleasing game over Sots 1.  A much slower build up to a vast empire but you have many more options.  As much as I like it I enjoy Sword of The Stars 1 over 2. You can buy the complete 1 for a steal.  It plays fast and has a very robust networking allowing reentry after a turn is done. the ai on both work well and gives you a run for  your money.SOTS 2 is worth playing for anyone who likes the genre but SOTS 1 is a better buy with lan capability and direct mp play thorugh ip addresses as It needed Gamespy for mp games which is long gone.

												This game was terrible when it started because the game was full of bugs and it was still in alpha stage (not even beta!) when they released it. The company basically had runned out of money to continue so they released the game as is to get money to keep developping the game! Well 2 years later, they kept their promise, which is a rarity in the games company world! and now the game is great! The bugs are pretty much gone, the new faction the loa is pretty original and well, if you like deep space strategy, this game is up your alley.The only thing is that the learning curve is pretty steep for a newcomer. Put the game on EASY difficulty and don't worry if you still get beaten up the first or second game. Just explore the tek tree, which change each game you play and depends in part on the faction you play! No mini-maxing here, you have to play with the tek you got! Also, the tek description is often imprecise in indicating what it does It does not give you hard numbers. For example, you get a laser but is it better than bullets? The damage number says the laser is inferior but in an actual battle, against drones and missiles, the laser is more useful. Against ships, it hit like a wet noodle which is fun to eat but not so much to beat a ship with! ;-) Thats why you need a few games at first to feel out what the tek actually do, especially the combat ones. But you get the hang of it pretty fast unless you're brain damaged or something. If you are, then what the heck are you playing this game for?You can customize your ships to your heart content, each faction has a unique mode of travel through space, which means a different strategy for each faction. They even got different toughness of their ship. Also different speed.The ai is pretty tought. If you let it expand too much, you're going to get screwed pretty fast, but if you expand too much,  you're also going to be in a rough place! Hehehehe! The 'Hard' difficulty is for insane megalomaniac who micromanage the hairs on their butts to manage to eck out a win. It's THAT tought.There are also a boatload of random encounters, that you can adjust how much of them you want, from none at all to one knocking on your door every turns! And they range from mere annoyance to mega dangerous crap in your pant system killer who basically eradicate your system from the universe! That one is pretty ouch! But how much you laugh when you see it go into your ennemies territory! heheheSo all in all, now a great game to play.			",76,10,0,33,37,0,41

												If you ignore any history or preconceptions of a 4x/strategy game you may have, and only compare SotS2 to its predecessor, its still not worth what you're paying for. The AI lacks the indicated intelligence. The UI is anything but, and the host of bugs can at times make the game unplayable even for the most hardened of 4x fans. And the icing on the cake is that the ""developer"" has abandoned this potential diamond to remain as nothing but the dirt we have before us. I can only hope a community of mod hungry men and women see this wreck for its original potential.			",113,9,0,19,13,0,48

												I do not recommend this game.  If you played, and enjoyed, Sword of the Stars I after they had ""finished it"" over the course of several years and expansions, you will be in for a shock in Sword of the Stars II.  The User Interface is less than friendly, there is no tutorial, there are few pop ups that explain the many statistics in game, and much of what was intuitive was removed.  No more clicking to send a fleet somewhere; now it's ""mission based movement"" that require you to be in X range, assign a mission to that planet, and automatically return to the originating planet.  This is as of Dec. 28th 2012 with the most up-to-date version.  I'd recommend playing Sword of the Stars I again over this and would gladly join you in a multiplayer game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I won't reiterate on the launch story of this game, although I was there to witness it all. It is largely stable now and very much enjoyable, though probably not the easiest game to get into.First of all I'd like to mention one thing that drew me to this series of games: it's the great universe it depicts. It's a universe filled with races as detailed, likable and integral in their portrayal, as one could expect from an RPG. And it’s not simple the backstory from a manual: I liked very much how it seeped into little details in the game from drives to voices to event reports. It shows that the authors cared about their world and the species that populate it, and Sword of the Stars is the only game where I liked all of the different races.It is also not a lifeless universe where only the major empires dwell. From silicoid swarms to grand menaces, there are always greater forces at work. Minor events influence your decisions early game, while aforementioned grand menaces may shape the entire match later on. I have witnessed everyone in a multiplayer game banding together to deal with a swarm of planet-sized self-replicating machines that have already stripped a good chunk of the map clean of all resources, and it’s the unexpected that makes many games memorable.These events are also part of the story, with many of them heralding the introduction of new races over the years, and shaping existing factions.It gets me to the third thing that I like about this game: replayability. It is paramount to 4x games in general, and Sword of the Stars goes further than most in this field. Besides events that I've talked about that help make each game memorable, there are different ways to travel among the stars for different races and randomized research tree. The latter may sound like a hindrance, but I found it to add immensely to the uniqueness of each game. It doesn't allow you to cherry-pick some kind of best combination and stick to it in every game, and when luck is not on your side, it provides for some challenge in overcoming your opponents despite the shortcomings of technology available to you.The tech tree really links with the great ship customization. Beyond the great visual design of ships for different races, the game goes beyond three cannons that improve with new technologies. Further research provides a plethora of new options for each race in a system of soft counters. It means that a certain technology may be better against another, but not to the point where a fleet equipped with the former will curb-stomp a fleet built around the latter regardless of tactics employed. A clever selection of technologies provide you with an advantage, but rarely an overwhelming one.What I said so far may sound like I consider SotS2 the best game ever created, and I apparently hold it in rather high regard. However, the Achilles heel of this game as it is now is mediocre AI, which is not really surprising in a game like this. It does a decent job now in adapting to your strategy and keeping its empire going and expanding. However its behavior in tactical combat is not really diverse, and it choices in diplomacy sometimes seem awkward and inconsistent. As my experience with the game grew I found the need to arrange some serious odds against me to make up for AI mediocrity.Multiplayer can alleviate the previous concern quite a bit, and the game really shines online, but each game is so long you rarely can expect to finish it in one evening, and have to arrange for successive sessions which is not always possible. When a person leaves, AI takes over his empire, but like I said, it does mediocre job at best. Multiplayer also took a blow from GameSpy shutdown, so you have to arrange games through a global chat, which is nice, but not actually the most convenient way to handle multiplayer.After all is said and done, Sword of the Stars 2 remains one of the best space 4x games in my opinion, and definitely an unique flower that I hope will continue to bloom and give fruit.

												I love this game. Unfortunately it's not for the faint of heart. Combat can be a little slow and occasionally buggy, and the star map is often difficult to navigate and a little bleak. However I loved owning my space empire in this game. The research, building fleets, managing it's terraforming infrastructure colonization. It has an amazing story behind each of the races and has a unique twist for each one with their FTL travel and how they research. It's a great game, with it's flaws, but playing it is a wonderful experience.			",42,13,0,19,16,0,17

												Not quite what i'd want for a SoTS II Title, i think they should have stuck with a few things form the First game but overall, it's a decent Sequal to a very good 4X game.  It's got quite a learning curve even for seasoned SoTS players like me, but once you understand the new concepts and UI (Most of the re-learning of things is the UI and ship management areas) then you should be all set to enjoy this series again.Although it's not quite what i had hoped, i'd still suggest it to people who are fond of SoTS.  For New people to the series, i might suggest playing the first SoTS first.			",106,9,10,25,39,0,42

												You've probably seen the metacritic score and already discounted this game or maybe you've heard about the disastraous launch, and discounted it. This isn't the 'game' that launched. Kerberos have been solidly patching since November of last year and at a rate of a patch (+hot fix due to short development cycle) a week for the last few months. The result is a sci-fi 4X that is currently peerless and still isn't quite upto what Kerberos wanted at launch. I adore this game and will push anyone interested in the genre directly at it. My only advice is to be patient, read the beginners guide linked in the launcher, read the manual, ask questions on the helpful forums and check the wiki. It's truly worth it.

												The initial release of Sword of the Stars II was possibly the most shambolic release of a game I have ever seen, it made Master of Orion 3 look like a masterpiece of finished product.A year on, and free to people who didn't take up the refund offer on the original, the Enhanced Edition finally shows what Sword of the Stars II should have been on release - a worthy successor to the ground-breaking original. It took them a while, but they got there in the end.There's still a few rough edges, and some of the easy accessibility of the original is gone, but the sequel shows that they're still willing to challenge some of the design conventions that 4X games all-too-often find themselves blindly defaulting to.

												I can now recommend this game to my friends. Why now you ask?  ""It's like two years old!""  Simple. I fired it up just the other day after many, MANAY patches and guess what? It doesn't suck anymore!  In truth, its a very good game. Sure, the Dev team released it way too early,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off a lot of people. The ones that wanted a refund got it. Those that didn't, well, we waited...and waited... Now it's paid off! This game is pretty good and I'm loving it so far.   Had to sit down and learn how to play it, even had to read up on some things, as this game isn't really made to just jump into, thinking you are going to know what the hell you are doing.  Once it does click though, you'll have a blast!  If you enjoy  4x space games, then give this one a shot. It's turned based while in empire mode. Giving orders to explor systems and colonizing planets.  Reserching techs to do all types of things.   As well as designinh new ships and building them. Then when combat happens, it's in real time. Let the fire works begin!Edit: Now if I could jsut get a better computer to play it on. I can rack up my total hours of game play. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game really does slow down the longer into the game you get but I am talking 150+ turns.Small maps work with less than 2 other players just fine even after the 150 turn mark. The most fun you will have in this game will be mid game starting a-fresh with a new Race on different maps against other races will keep you having fun for at least 20 hours, providing you enjoy the 4X game style. The game is very in depth when it comes to tech and ship design.overall a good game.			",142,14,1,26,29,2,49

												Overall a good game.  When first released the game was unplayable yes but now it is extremely playable.My only gripes are the radically changed command system lack of ability to change map sizes (without a third party program) compared to SotS prime.  My problem with the command system is that instead of just pressing “M” to move a fleet now you have to assign a “mission”.   My other issue is that when you “set up” a game you don’t have the ability to customize the maps like in SotS.  I really liked being able to set minimum distance between stars, star count etc but again with a 3rd party program you can do just that. However all is not bad.  The new Loa race is fun to play, especially considering I can’t think of another game that lets you play as an AI race.  Another bonus is now you start off with cruisers instead of destroyers, you can still have destroyers but they are now drones carried on special hulls and act as little more than a meat shield.  Another benefit of SotS2 is that the tech tree is full but your ability to research tech is dependent on feasibility studies.  But this means that even with a 1% chance of feasibility you still have a chance to research and get the tech. Some people complain about the ""end turn"" times. Trust me those will save you much headache later down the line as while you have that period of time of nothing it gives you a chance to reflect about overall strategy.This game also has a throw you to the wolves learning system.  Many players have created guides though so you aren't completely screwed but If you enjoy learning by yourself it can be quite enjoyable.Highly recommended			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When this game was released, it was one of the increasing number of games that were seemingly published before they were ready. I didn't get the game then, because of all the reported bugs, and because I had no cash.But about a year after it was published, I had a bit of money, and I thought the game was ready, so Ibought it. While steam says I've spent about 55 hours playing this game so far, because I have been without internet for a good portion of the time I have owned the game, I probably have put more like two or three hundred hours in.If you like the 4X genre of grand strategy games, or turned based strategy games with real-time tactics in general, I think that this game is the one for you. It's got lots of complex mechanics that allow for an interesting, irrepeatible gameplay experience.My main gripe about this game, compared to its predecessor, is the tech tree. I think that the study feasiblity mechanic was not the best way to make the tree semi-random. Also, the effect of some techs seem to be a bit questionable, whether or not they actually do anything.But on the whole, I would recommend this for anyone who has played Sword of the Stars Prime, or anyone who enjoys this genre of games.

												As you can tell by the hours I invested in this game, I really enjoy Sword of the Stars II: Enhanced Addition. Like with any game and game upgrade, it's a learning process. SOTS II is a much more involved and complex game than it's predesesor, SOTS I. Still, I am learning the operation and control of the game as I go along.A few things I need to mention, the pluses. Of course, a lot better graphics goes a long way. I also like the variety of settings that  it comes with. The ship design function is great, at least to me. The possiility of colonizing multiple planets in a star system is a great concept as well. Another plus is the having a Squadron CnC direct control of the Fleets, commanded by an Admiral.You may wonder what I would like to see added (again) or improved:1) I would like to see more Stellar systems (up to 350-like the old SOTS)2) I liked the way the trade software operated in the old SOTS: 13) I liked the idea of sharing technology with allies.4) I liked observing my allies combat segments5) I would like my spies to be able to steal technology from the enemy.

												Despite what some people say Sots2 is better than sots prime. The new fleet system is way more awesome, partly because the old was really bad. It's actually an interesting game mechanic combined with fleet stations.The graphics are much better. The research tree is IMHO improved. The trade system is also easier to deal with. Diplomacy actually works, despite what some less successful players claim.All in all a much improved gameplay over sots prime. BUT! ... Programming wise Sots2 is a disaster. Any map above 5 players is unplayable by turn 120-150. Feel like waiting 5 minutes per turn? Then go ahead and play a 8 player map. (Also no random universes, which is lame)Play a 5 player map and ONCE start you understanding all the new little wonderful tweaks and opportunities in sots2, you're going to have a really good time.This game is not for the average player as the manual and guides just plain suck at explaining where to find all those wonderful little tweaks.

												This game is probably had the worst release in history.  It had a bigger list of features that didn't work than those that did and was an unplayable mess.  All this and the company continued to push pre-release sales despite knowing the terrible state of the game, which left a very bad taste in the mouth of those excited by this sequel to a quite enjoyable first outing.To their credit they did work on it for about a year and got it to a state they wanted on release, which still wasn't that great, but it was at least playable (though still quite crashy).  Now, it seems they have abandoned it and it still isn't really finished and you can't really blame them.  To continue to work on it wouldn't be a great financial decision.  Sometimes it is best to just cut your losses and move on.Is there a future for this game?  Maybe, but it is in hands of modders.  Maybe one day this game could come close to its potential and what was promised by the devs, until then I can't recommend anyone buy a game I myself don't have double figures in hours played and have no plans to ever reinstall.

Another plus is the having a Squadron CnC direct control of the Fleets, commanded by an Admiral.You may wonder what I would like to see added (again) or improved:1) I would like to see more Stellar systems (up to 350-like the old SOTS)2) I liked the way the trade software operated in the old SOTS: 13) I liked the idea of sharing technology with allies.4) I liked observing my allies combat segments5) I would like my spies to be able to steal technology from the enemy.

												Not as bad as people say, especially after all the patching that was done. still pretty unoptomized but at least its more ambitious then CIV V in space. also best space ship designer in the genre. just be prepared to put up with some tedium and read the manual like its 1998.

												Great game, are you a fan of sci fi stuff and space strategy games, if so get it, as simple as that. No problems currently of yet present in the game as there was at launch, the developers have done a great job at patching it. A couple of minor glitches that  have appeared but nothing game breaking and no ctd's.Compared to similar games like sins if a solar empire, this game is a far deeper game, better research, better graphics, more tactical and there is also a ship designer, brilliant game, 9/10.

												This is my favorite military space 4X. It has the basic foundation to become the best 4X military conquest game ever!And I have played this game many more hours (1000+) than what is recorded, as I usually play offline.I bought this game after buying and playing SotS complete (SotS I or prime), despite a lot of the negative reviews and I am so glad I did. For me totally worth $24.99.A lot of the negativity surrounds the unfinished nature and bugs upon it's initial release, which Kerberos Production ""mostly"" fixed over a years time.If you were going to compare this game to others in the genre then it would be something inbetween Sins of a Solar Empire and Star Drive II...and more like Star Drive II than Sins.Pros: 1) Sjet modules, I mean C'mon! I don't care who you are, that Rocks!2) Best research Forest I have used. Some techs on one tree cannot be unlocked until other techs in other trees have been unlocked.3) Long range travel is different for each race adding a very important strategic element as well as replay factor.4) A very comprehensive yet intuitive ship/platform design system.5) Satisfying real time tactics battle engagement system in 3D space.Cons:1) limited galaxy setup, no choosable starting locations.2) AI on hard, is very aggresive at beginning, and stays aggresive....but doesn't seem to max out it's fleet capacity or build leviathans that I have seen as yet.3) Somethings in the game can get a little tedious, although I think this is more often than not, just part of the genre.4) you might need a decent comp to get the most out of the game, probably 2x what the minimum requirements are.5) information on some controls and/or effects of research can be hard to find or cannot be found.6) 3D space is limited, no where near as expansive as HW or Shallow Space but since you can move your units up or down better than Sins.Other: Some what steep learning curve weather or not you have played Sots I or prime (and this game is deffinitely not Sots I). Very much recommended to read every guide on steam as well as much as the Sotsii wiki you can. Some of the information is outdated while some of it is still very relevant from any one author, so it is best to read all.I have not encountered any game breaking bugs, the game has crashed twice, maybe 3 times on me, and I just simply restarted and continued from where it crashed with no further issues. There does seem to be an issue if you leave the game paused for a certain length of time, like 20 min or more. In that case it seems to go into window mode (usually) or it looses the UI and you can't really do anything (rare). Again restart and resume.If you love 4X military games but are somewhat skeptical from all the negative reviews, then I would definitely get it on sale. But if you like Star Drive 2, then you should love this game.Disclosure: I have only played as the Human Race in this game. System Specs: I7 4930K @4.5, 16gig 1800Mhz, SSD, FuryX, Win10.

												A really difficult game to review - first thing to establish is that  lot of the negative reviews come from when this game was first released, which from what i can make out was one of the worst releases in game history! Second thing to establish is that whilst the game has been hugely improved since launch their are still problems, most notably for me was the lack of help provided by the game design, things like moving fleets which in most games is really easy in this is not intuitive at all! Balancing economies is also not easy and undertsnading the complexities of FTL travel variations and research options are also poorly explained in game.However after struggling with a game which didnt explain itself i watched a couple of lets play episodes which helped explain the basics and tried again and i can safely say this is a fun and really detailed game! the races are significantly different, research is slow so you have to make big choices early game to figure out strategies, the visuals are cool, not amazing but you certainly get a feel for epic clashes going on in deep space, and flicking through finance spreadsheets is depressingly fun (who new data could be so exciting!)  If youre interested in space/4x games i would recommend trying this - it doesnt feel like a carbon copy 4x game (a genre of game i would love to love but also find becomes a bit stale and repetative), instead it brings new features to the table (the mission system which means you can only give your fleets in the strategic mapmode a single mission [survey, strike, invade, intercpet, construct, colonize, relocate etc.] before they have to return to refuel/restock - which sounds annoying but means you have to plan ahead and makes your fleets feel far more realistic than most strategy games where they ca just keep on going) - however I would also strongly reccomend watching a lets play video first otherwise poor UI could really drive you mad			",38,5,0,14,7,1,32

The game was released early due to lack of funding, and now the dev team is working nonstop to better the game with 2-3 patches a week. I support this awesome game, and while I might have to wait a bit to truely be able to enjoy it, I encourage others to do the same and support this game so we can all get a gem in the end.

												This is an update to my older review in which i did not reccomend the game. Now i do. I managed to fix my problems and for most wondering how to get it to work well with the graphics on high is when you go to the options menu un-check all the boxes besides decals and it should improve a lot. The game has SOOOO much depth to it. But it is hard to learn. The graphics are amazing and the new features are countless. I think the with a little more work this game could have been so much better. I honestly think that this game is not that bad. but what makes it good is the new weapons and the pretty explosions! having Leviathan vs. Leviathan is really neat when you leanr the game enough. I am glad to reccomend this game now, and I hope this will help anyone with making decisons to buy this game.			",262,34,7,43,38,5,45

While some things are being developed still i feel as if the game is very enjoyable, it has the best space gaphics i have ever seen in a space game, and would highly recommend it for any who wish to conquer the galaxy.

												So disappointing. As a fan of the original, I was looking forward to this edition. But even after they patched it to reasonable stability (it was broken at release!), I just cannot seem to enjoy it.One reason I loved the original was how streamlined it felt. Sadly, SotS II overcomplicated the whole thing. Many new mechanics and commands were thrown in without sufficient explanation of how they worked. I was lost. Very little of my experience with SotS I was useful. I had to do research online just to figure out how to start playing. That is sad.If you are looking for a more comprehensive review, look elsewhere. I barely played it, and cannot motivate myself to sacrifice more time. I'd rather play Endless Space. Heck, play Sword of the Stars I. That game is good!			",111,18,1,16,14,0,29

												Playing SOTS 2 makes me want to play SOTS 1. I can see how they might have felt like they were making improvements to the SOTS concept. But they did such an unbelievably bad job putting the whole thing together that it blows my mind.The user interface is atrocious. It's difficult to figure out how to do things that should be simple. I can't always tell what can and can't be interacted with. I'll give you a tip there by letting you know that most of what you see cannot be interacted with. The more I played the game, the more convinced I became that the game was intentionally designed to make gameplay as difficult and confusing as possible.The game runs slowly in different ways. Even the game menu feels sluggish. It's even worse when you're actually in the game. The first time I clicked ""next turn"" it took 5-10 seconds to process the turn, which gives me nightmares about how long it might take in the late game when the map is fully populated.The combat is much less intuitive than SOTS 1. It was very noisy, but I couldn't really see what was happening. I couldn't see any of the little laser beams or plasma cannon shots flying around. Just missles graphics cutting in and out. I think they redesigned things to look more realistic, but the end result was that it looked like garbage compared to SOTS 1.Based on User Interface alone, I think the game developers should be ashamed of themselves. It's so bad, that I would actually rather do math homework.			",32,2,0,7,9,0,16

												I have tried this game for a long time now, I really want to play a whole game. The problem is whenever I go in to tech tree while I am researching a tech the game crashes, Every time when in it for different amout of seconds. This is foolish and a poor game flaw.Edit:After Trying to figure out the crashing about 5-6 times I got it working consistently, priority High for mars.exe seems to do the trick and maybe window mode, but this will still remain a thumbs down, as I did expect somthing a bit better. The cames customization is freaking amazing and will keep me playing for a long time. The ship design is pretty good as well as the diversity between the races ships.If I did not need to spend FOREVER fixing this issue myself I would have giving the game a 6/10, but sadly it gets a 3/10 for being such an unpolished game with crashing up the♥♥♥♥♥♥I would love to see this game in its full glory, or the customization added to a game like Sins, put them togeather and make a mega awesome baby.

												A good game that seemingly got screwed by the ""kitchen sink"" effect. Very ambitious of a game - 3d tactical space battles that don't feel like a cheese fest or ""just get everything as close as possible and fire away"". There's not much rock-paper-scissors stuff - though you can adapt your ships and tactics, there's no guarentee that it'll be a completely effective counter to your enemies. On top of that, even though the races share the same tech trees, each get a few 'race specific' techs, and you're not even guaranteed to be able to research every technology - some trees may be almost completely unobtainable without salvaging the enemy's ships. Save game files are in SQLite, so grabbing an editor can help with situations where something has gone haywire - which does happen occasionally.			",47,7,0,25,26,0,33

												Sword of the Star II has kept me engaged since the day I bought it and every penny was well spend.  There are not many 4x  Space games that are worth giving positive reviews these days but Paradox Interactive	did amazing job with this 4x Genre. I sure hope Paradox Interactive is working on New and Improved version of Sword of the Stars II. I will be looking forward to Sword of the Stars 3 !!! with great anticipation. Developers have constanly patched this game until the annoying Bugs were fixed and now its a very stable and playable game. Sword of the Stars II is highly recommended for 4x Genre Fans. Another alternative to this would be SINS OF SOLAR EMPIRES which offers  close to stability and ultimate adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short, this game exceeded my expectation, given that I enjoyed its predecessor sots1 very much and read a lot of negative reviews on sots2 in its early state. For better or worse, this tier had bought much more complexity over the original sots1 as HOI3 compared with HOI2. With a much steeper learning curve, some people are bound to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and others intrigued.Having read lots of negative review along the line, I was quite skeptical before buying this game. The main complain comes from the instability and bugs and the game looks like unpolished beta release. Well those were written a long time back and I realized that many of them were written by people who has never spent enough time to learn the game mechanism or even user interface. Sots franchise is a rather serious game despite what its stylish artwork might suggest. It has complex and detailed mechanism underneath and very distinguishing species perk for each playable faction. Like the Hearts of Iron franchise, you need to devote quite some effort to understand game mechanism but once you did you'll love it.There are a lot of improvements over old systems. The space station is greatly enhanced compared to sots1. It now has broad choice of station type, 5 level in its development stage and dozens of station modules. Trade system is replaced by a more specific one which accounts for amount of trade goods produced, number of freighters and available civilian docks. Star system is divided into suns and planets. Now you colonize planet instead of the entire star system. Colonized worlds are divided into provinces with its adminstrative benefit. Strategy turn pace is somehow slowed because fleet operations are mission-oriented now. Each fleet has its own base of operation and endurance capacity if operates outisde supply line. Fleet have to return base for resupply before another mission can be scheduled. Fleets which can't carry enough supply for a specific mission simply won't accept it in the first place. This is very much like how airforce works in Heats of Iron3. This makes a planet with advanced space station a natural strongpoint in the whole sector, able to respond rapidly in nearby systems and spend less time runing back and forth to the conflict system than the enemy. But then you must also time your missions carefully cause you won't be able to reassign another missions once dispatched with a few exceptions.Another major improvement is the armor model and tactical control. Ship won't sustain damage unless armor layers are gone and rounds are applies directly on ship internals and also cause subsystem critical hit in the process. Armor is break down into four sides(top, button, left, right) for each of the section (bridge, mission, propulsion), and each side has its own specific layout consisite of width and depth of armor belt which must be penetrated to damage ship internals. And each weapon has its own unique damage profile. Laser will mostly dig a deep hole out of the armor matrix while a massdrive mostly chew out a wide but shallow chunk of armor. projectile with explosive warhead and penetration capacity will dig a narrow hole into armor matrix before detonate and create a large chunk of damaged blocks deeper down. General armor resistence is applyed depending on ship class to simulate better protection level on larger ships. One can now manually rotate ship to hide damaged armor away from enemy and limited vertical maneuver (upper, middle ,lower plane)So for sure the dev didn't just put some eyecandy on graphic engine and make it a sequel. There is very serious work involved and based on words on its wiki page, scenarios are not yet published because the same staff is working on AI improvement and that's clearly of higher priority than a few scripted maps. So the game is very much mutural at this stage yet with prospect of further update to push it even higher. It makes Sins of a Solar Empire like an arcade game. But since arcade is also fun on its own term, it again comes down to personal taste and preference.			",54,9,1,3,12,0,18

												Is this game worth $20?  No, I don't think so: the UI is clumsy, tool-tips are often misleading, it has many odd artifacts, the diplomatic system is impentrable, and SotSII slows down significantly late game.  But is it worth @$7.00?  Maybe.  In truth, I bought my copy from Bundle Stars (Steam key) and got the game for less than $1.00, and at THAT price it is a bargain.Kerberos has stabilized the game significantly from it's initial release and I've played 1,000 turn games without a crash.  The battles are beautiful and tactically interesting, the tech tree is much improved over the original SotS, and the economics aspect of the game is virtually hands-free.  It appears that Kerberos made several player-requested changes to the game, but ran out of funding before all of them could be implemented (such as the post-it feature from the first game) and the instruction manual/tool-tips updated.  It would behoove any new players to visit the Kerberos website and browse the forums because many of the changes to the game are explained there.I recommend this game to any player who is a patient fan of the space 4X genre and is willing to devote some time exploring for its undocumented features.

												Did you like Sword of the Stars? Did you enjoy all of the expansion packs but wanted a bit more to the actual Empire section of the game?This should be your dream game then.However its far from the comfy and smooth sailing that SotS Prime is now. Id recommend this only to a hardcore 4X fan.The combat is gorgeous and beautiful, The Empire management is deeper, much deeper in comparison to the first and this particular one has come a LONG way from what it was since release.Probably the only decent 4X Space game with good combat alongside it, if you can stomach the long turn times and overtime gameplay slowdown.

Once in awhile you might run into someone who crashed his car into a a huge vat of human vomit and instead of climbing out like a normal person, they'll rather drown in the vomit than admit they crashed the car.The game isn't utter garbage like it was when it was released but it's still pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ridiculously long turn times. Severely horrible optimization that requires supercomputers to process when games get long. The UI is worse than the♥♥♥♥♥wiping of a disabled grandmother. Even issuing commands is unnecessarily convoluted!Diplomacy is nonexistent. All the planets are all virutally the same. The only thing this game has going for it is the pretty battles though even that could use some work.Buy SotS 1 and play that instead.			",84,9,0,15,4,1,35

												I won't lie, this game can be hard to get into. But once you do, it's as enjoyable, if not more so, than other 4X strategy games thanks to its complexity. I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5, due mainly to complexity and strain it puts on my computer. Note my computer isn't some terrible thing either, being fairly recent (no more than a few years old, if that).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR: Ridiculously overly complicated to the point of not being fun at all.I tried so hard to get into this game but I just can't...  I loved, absolutely loved Sword of the Stars, amazing game and a great experience but this... this is just something else entirely.  Imagine a good game being assembling a car part by part (a part being the engine, frame, a door, ect.) and this game is assembling a car piece by piece. (all 57,000 pieces of the engine, ect.)  It's just ridiculously overly complicated and the UI is painful to get used to and just when you think you're getting the hang of things you find some obscure option that turned out to be critical for development and you should have done that 50 turns ago, oops.  I spent 6 hours in this game and never even made it to a battle, I spent all my time trying to figure out wtf to do and starting over a few times because I found out something that I crippled myself by not doing way sooner.I've seen videos and the graphics are awesome, the battles look amazing and I really wanted to experience some epic battles but I never made it that far because I couldn't bring myself to wade through the toxic wasteland of horrible interface and complex development to make it to a decent battle.  It really pains me how horrible this game turned out to be, I wanted it to be amazing, I had a dream... a dream which was utterly crushed when the game released.  My dream was restored when I saw the ""enhanced edition"" with ""blah blah fixes ect ect"" only to be crushed again by the fact that the game was awful.  By the time you can make it to a battle in this game you could completely finish any other decent game and actually enjoy part of that time.  Shame on you Kerberos and Paradox for this disgusting mutation of Sword of the Stars and for bringing hope only to dump on it later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just bad, I mean really bad. Firstly, this game's bugs makes sonic 06 look like Mario Galaxy 2. Sometimes, the bugs make the game all out unplayable (as in I cannot even get to the title sequence). But let's take a look at the gameplay. It is also terrible. Right off the back, I can tell that they were either clueless about faction balancing or just flat-out didn't care. The Loa faction is capable of wiping out the entire solar system controlled by an enemy without even having to invade the system and that leaves the other factions incapable of responing to the situation (which is the last thing a strategy game should have).  I would love to tell you about the diplomacy section, but it doesn't work, so I can't tell you about it. The graphics are good, but the game has terrible lag and will often ruin your experience of emersion. The nail in the coffin, however, is the lack of feedback this game gives you. This game has alot of factors that influences your performance (aka. public opinion, economy, ect.) and virtually no way of telling you about it. You will easily find yourself fighting a powerful military with construction ships. I would forgive all of this, had it not been for the fact that there were 5 patches and upgrades apiece when i bought this game nearly a year and 6 months after its terrible release. Do not buy this game unless you are a developer so you know how not to make a strategy game (though there are other options that are better)...			",9,0,0,0,0,0,15

												Pros+ship component targeting+slite economic policy conrol+varried factions+combat and fleet formations better that most space strategy gamesCons-mid to late game gets very frustrating because of inability to traverse large mapsduring realtime battles, you can spend up to three turns trying to take one solar systemthats what made me stop playingIf you are a fan of space stragy games i HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you instead buy DISTANT WORLDS UNIVERSEits real time, you can slow or speed up the time, pirates can be a bother but they can also smugle hard to comebyminerals to your colonies need, tax rates, trade sunction, mutual defense treaties, ground invations, research boosting locations, huge tech trees that affect how you will spead out or stagnate, pirate attacks can devastate your economy, strong fleets can be an asset to ward of the space scum and save your ecomony, but if your fleets are too large they  can suck your sate coffers dry and many more. The graphics arent that good but there are mods, i am uninstalling it because it is too nice and im wasting too much time on it, if you think the price is too high wait for a sale(I did)			",22,2,0,6,6,0,17

												The premis fo rthe game is alright.  But there are no detailed isntructions on hwo to play the game and how each thing works in the game, especially when it comes to ships and missions and movement of those ships.  I have spent a great deal of time figuring out what everything does and im still not 100% done.  Almost played for 100 hours.  I t would be a good game if it wasnt so darn confusing on  how to play it.  You have been warned, play at ur own risk.			",68,8,0,22,15,0,46

												It has been 3 years since I bought this game on release and I have yet to finish it. Still buggy, slow, and just down right boring. I have been very disappointed with this game and company. I don't think I will ever purchase another game from them. You might give it a go, as I hear some have no problems at all with it. Just don't play the Sotsverse map as it is broken since they downsized it to accommidate poor coding and load times.Have fun with it if you can. I didn't and feel completely ripped off even after 3 years. Yep, still mad! lol.			",27,9,0,22,12,0,31

Posted: December 2, 2013
												Short and sweet: Dont buy the game, dont support the devolopers. The game has had a year of patches and features are still non-functional, the AI is laughable, and there are still bugs and crashes.The Nitty Gritty: The developers put out the game as a steaming mess, almost every feature in the game non-functional. Literally, every feature, from combat to building to trading to diplomacy. Everything was horrendous. After a year and a 'free' expansion, the game still has features and techs that don't function. Unfortunately, the rate of patches and updates released for it has slowed, as the developer has essentially run out of money to fund it, instead having to turn to other games to try and garner the neccessary funds to continue releasing patches. In essence, the game is a traditional turn-based 4x, with a focus on combat rather than the micro-management of an empire. Credit given where it is due, the combat is pretty, with satisfying weapons and ships that look great when they go boom. The game uses an armor-matrix system instead of health to determine the damage ships take, with boxes of armor mitigating damage till weapons penetrate the hull, and even then you have to hit something critical to put the ship out of commision. Of course, its hard to tell what the critical hits actually do, because it provides little information in game, forcing you to go to an external wiki.The tech tree is satisfying, with tons of different options and plenty of weapons, enforcing the focus on fighting. You can construct stations and devote them to each of the various trees to help you develop techs faster, giving you an edge on the opponent, but it can get expensive quick. Stations are also fairly easy to kill, so must be defended. For veterans of the original game, the tech tree doesnt go much higher than antimatter, but is diverse enough to make you want to see everything in it. The addition of battle riders, smaller ships carried into battle by larger ones, is welcome, though the interface for working with them is frustrating, making you assign them to each ship capable of carrying them, rather than just filling them up. Micromanagement where there should be an option to bypass it makes the game frustrating in several situations like this, especially when its in referance to a bunch of ships that are going to get blown away and have to be replaced every battle. The UI is usable, with everything fairly clear and easy to understand. Everything is controlled by sliders, allowing you to easily dedicate your empire to production or research, while still allowing you to drill down and make planets do specific tasks for you. The Empire Overview is another section that could use some more explanation, as some of the sliders seem arbitrary but serve purposes, such as the ones relating to security. Most of the complexity in the interface could be easily served by a tutorial, which the game lacks, instead relying on an overlay which you can toggle which is supposed to point out how everything works. As of this writing, most things are functional, with combat not crashing all the time, trade working as intended, and the interface being usable, if not sometimes cryptic. However, the AI is still lacking any challenge at all to a human player, end of turn times are still bad, and diplomacy is still in what essentially appears to be place-holder graphics, with little to no built-in explanation of what anything does. Several technologies are not working, with vague descriptions of what they should do. The developers have done a good job of making it playable, and for that I applaud them, but the state of the game at release  was unforgiveable and should not be forgotten. Overall, the game is playable and moderately fun, with combat being the highlight of the game. Lousy AI makes it rather repetitive unfortunately, because it forces you to fight over every single planet they own. Diplomacy is still cryptic, and turn times are still a little long, but you can now get through an entire game from start to finish. I recommend playing it with your friends if at all, because that is the only challenge you will get with it, and the only way the diplomacy makes any sense. The unfortunate reality of having to have the wiki open in another window at all times is frustrating, because all the information should be given in game, but is not. I still do not recommend buying it, even with the developers attempts to make good by their players, because it was unnacceptable to launch it in such a state, and judging by the rate of updates now, it will never be in a complete state. If you dont mind learning the interface and stumbling through things, then you can find some enjoyment in it.			",83,11,2,19,32,3,62

												A few years ago I discovered SoTS 1 and have been in love with it ever since, by far it's my favorite 4X space game out there that I know of. That being said, SoTS 2 is a totally different game, and I wouldn't recommend it for those who are faint of heart and not willing to invest some time in learning the mechanics of the game. Although this game is pretty good, the gui is a bit esoteric, requiring some trial and error to learn where everything is and what everything does. If you've played SoTS 1 and are looking into this game, be prepared for a totally different experience. Battles are a bit odd, and the whole prototyping system, while it makes sense, isn't very friendly to trial and error in terms of making designs. Overall, I would suggest this game to anyone who likes 4X space games and is OK with a good learning curve and some weirdly implemented game concepts.			",55,13,0,18,28,0,20

												This game is now far better than all of the reviews from it's inital launch. The developers are fervanantly behind it, with regular work being done to improve the A.I. further.Each race has it's own unique method of FTL travel, and different chances at a randomised technology tree. The turn-based 4x style brings things down to a more manageable fleet based system, giving a size limit on fleets that may be used at the tactical level; also letting you customie ships through module and turret hardpoints on ship hulls, as well as by arranging 3 ship sections together while balancing limiting statistics to help with the overall balance of the game.Nothing that I have said will do justice to this ambitious work, which is in constant support from its developers. You must at least try this game if you are at all interested in Space Based 4x Stragegy games. Be warned though, you will want to be well above the minimum requirements listed on the game page.

												Enjoyable now. This game had a very bad start, it was released completly undone, not even beta stage...just not done. It took nearly 6 months for the game to finaly be patched enough to be playable, the company never gave up. Now it's a great game. I still think SotS1 is more polished, but in time i have faith SotS2 will be just as polished. There are 6 or 7 diffrent races, over a hundred technologies, basicly all the stuff from 1 + more. If you like 4x games or liked SotS1 get this...but wait till it's on sale. For those who don't know the game or the one before it, SotS is a 4x that's mostly based around crazy degrees of customization of your units, ships have moduals, hull sections, and tons of weapons that can all be customized in ways that matter, a lot. Check it out, but i also highly suggest you try SotS1.			",272,68,5,96,42,1,102

												this game plays way too slow for what it is , you have to physicly end each turn 2 times and more often then not you will loose planets to random encounters to the point of absurbness. Further more as a newer player you will learnthat all of your fleets return home so trying to bottle neck becomes a stupid effort to continuasly move your fleets back to the combat point . Its a micro manager heaven. Its not not like any other 4x style game that is remotely fun. there is some sort of memory leak somewhere wich needs to be fixed and you cant just skip battles you know you will loose and give the zone up ... you have to sit there for 5 imins and watch as your planet is lost . i wrote this review in the time it took to go from turn 80 to 81 now have to watch another 5 minute battle of some aai fleet blowing up yet another planet i have no defenses at . you could watch lord of the rings all episodes in les time then it takes to play tihis stupid game .... DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU WANT FUN this games is like cutting a lawn with a butter knife without any of the fun .  Or hitting a pinyata without a stick , with two broken legs and its hanging 100 feet away.... up			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
