												Background: Bought for pennies in the steam sale, never heard of it before.The Good:* Brilliant premise, locations and characters* Decent tutorial (does miss out a few useful hints)* Tons of ghosts to play with with fun interactions* Varied scenarios are brilliantly Scooby Do fun to explore* Trial and error hauntings are both good and challenging* Good balance between creepy and fun* Fun voice acting on the ghosts, Sims mumbling from the humans* Most missions are sub 30mins for quick diversions* 20 hour campaign, some replay valueThe Bad:* Graphics are dated.. looking Sims 2-esque* NPC Characters get hooked on the scenery, other glitches in pathing* The ghost/human menu is clunky and could give better feedback* Golden Plasm too easy to waste while learning the ropes* Replay and Upgrade-mansion interfaces are more awkward than seems necessary* Some hints on releasing bonus ghosts very vague* Cries out for more direct control and visually targeted attacks* Some scenarios have triggers you have no control over make the game too easyImpressions: Some games look great but are boring, others the reverse, this is the latter. It reminds me of the Commandos crossed with Hitman and The Sims 2 games..  looks dated but the game play shines. The game lovingly tiptoes around remaking famous setups from horror movies (the Evil Dead one is great) without getting so close they get sued.Recommended for: Strategy fans who like replay value and Sims fans who like to drown their vassals in ladderless pools.Conclusion.: 8/10. A game that triumphs in mechanics over visuals.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh, god! I remember this one from my teen years as a hilarious strategy simulation with an innovative concept, especially for its day. I spent days with my retail copy of the game, trying to find ways of releasing those trapped ghosts so I can recruit them! Ghost Master was developed by Sick Puppies Studio in 2003 and enjoyed some critical acclaim due to its intriguing concept. Yet, the game failing on a commercial level, the company closed its doors and Ghost Master remained to be a one shot wonder. Now looking back and enjoying the gameplay yet again, I can positively say that the game lost little in its fun and aged quite nicely anyhow.Welcome, Ghost Master! You are an incorporeal entity: a commander of the spirits of long deceased, haunting this realm to drive those silly mortals out of their wits! ...and you got summoned by a bunch of teenagers via an Ouija board for kicks. Immediately, you get rid of those pesky mortals by summoning your servants and set HQ in the abandoned school in Gravenville. Your next task: scaring the heck out of all those mortals inhabiting your town, teaching them paranormal lessons for their various misdeeds and recruiting new members for your team while you are at it. Enjoy!Okay, this all sounds wonderful. You are a big, bad ghost master capable of controlling various ghosts and scaring people... But remember that mortals are not defenseless. You'll face witches, mediums, mad scientists and ghostbreakers - actually ghostbusters, but you know, copyright issues - and try to overcome many challenges in each new mission you are introduced with. Gravenville also comes with its own distinct setting, consisting of countless parodies centering paranormal horror stories like Blair Witch, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Phantom of the Opera etc. Characters have their own stories wrapped in situational comedy.Talking about gameplay dynamics, in each mission you are to choose a team of 4-8 ghosts in your repertoire and go on for the haunting. As you win missions, you are given gold plasm based on the success of your haunting, calculated according to how much of a havoc you've managed to wreck in the building: how many mortals scared, any of your haunters get banished, how many new recruits you've managed to save etc. At the end of the haunt, you can visit your HQ and use gold plasm to train your ghosts to unlock many new abilities, building up different strategies for different missions.The game environment and graphics basically seem like The Sims 2 with a couple story buildings, AI people interacting with the environment and each other. Main difference is that you are the intruder. All your ghosts, depending on their types, need different fetters - items or places that they can be bound to, so their area of influence is limited. This is where the strategy part comes in. You collect plasm during the mission by scaring them and use collected plasm to activate their power levels, also arranging orders for when to use certain powers. Most levels come with puzzles to figure out and as you unlock new missions, things get harder and harder. All missions contain various other ghosts that you can newly recruit if you are to figure out how to free them from their mortal entrapments. They all will ask for certain obscure conditions in riddles to be met and figuring those conditions out is the half of your job. Once figured out, you are left with strategy and patience.Well, I think that would be all. The game isn't that long, but you are welcome to revisit old missions to gather gold plasm, unlocking new abilities and trying new strategies. The Steam and GOG versions of the game contain a new level at the end that wasn't presented in the original version and it is insanely hard. There is some talk that a fan-made Ghost Master 2 is in development at the moment, so fingers crossed!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												(I have the game on disk and played through it at least 3 times now, don't mind the steam time played)Ghost master is one of the hidden gems of gaming, an old game with a sims lookalike feel, but with completely different mechanics. In Ghost Master, you control an organisation of ghosts, spectres and horrors. Your objectives range from the simple and amusing frightening of mortals to gather energy from their fear to more complicated matters such as making sure the mortals find the bodies of murder victims to appease their spirits and many other tasks that are suitible for one controlling ghosts and spirits.Many levels have oppertunities to pick up new ghosts for your future missions, with their requests ranging from complicated tasks such as proving the corruption of one mortal to an other to the relatively simple tasks of freeing them from a fetter or bond placed upon them by breaking it in some way. The key aspect here is that you can not go and just smash or destroy the object yourself. You will need to use either your team's powers to control the circumstances such as the wind and rain or the mortals in a mission. Ghost Master will let you feel like you're playing a god...All while delegating these tasks to your ghosts and having goals set by someone or something higher up the chain of command. You organise an invisible force that tries to acomplish its goals through subtle manipulation of the mortals. Mortals who themselves might intervene in your plans - maybe they call in a medium to try to banish your ghosts, or perhaps they're just incredibly stubborn and refuse to believe in ghosts. Whatever the case, you can choose to do the absolute minimum needed, you can just scare off the mortals in as entertaining matters as you can...Or you can subtly manipulate them to do your bidding, get all the potential ghosts freed and play with those scared fools by checking on their individual fears and phobias to scare them as best as possible for as little energy as possible, or try to drive them insane(Though complete insanity is a thing that usually only works on those who are already unhinged, or with a LOT of time). Every one of them is different, with their own fears and a bio, their own jobs to do, their own behaviors their own relationships, and so on.Many of the levels include a puzzle-like request by a ghost, having you complete a task to set them free(At which point they join you for future missions). Usually this is a matter of resolving a last grievance they had while alive, or to do them a favour or break the item that holds them there. Some are easy, and others are incredibly hard.The ghosts are controlled by placing them at a fetter, something that they identify with and can use to stay in the physical realm. Something that fits them that they can inhabit in the physical world. It could be an electrical appliance for a gremlin, or a fireplace for a fire elemental, or objects with an emotional charge to them, a place, or even a child. You control what powers they have access to by feeding them energy, which you extract automatically from the fear of mortals(And powers with a bigger effect tend to have a higher cost). Mortals who do not believe in ghosts are harder to scare, so you need to boost their belief in the spirit world by odd events, such as rain indoors, unnatural cold, heat or luck, a sudden storm coming out of nowhere or several other things that don't quite fit or erode their mental barriers...Which coincidentally makes them easier to scare. But then there aren't only good things. The story ends on a cliffhanger, and sometimes the favour needed to free a ghost can be annoyingly frustrating and appear based on random chance more than your own actions. The game's recommend haunting team does not always have the powers needed to complete these favours, and you do not know what you're going to find in a level until you check it out. There are no missions aside from the story ones, and in my personal opinion there weren't enough that were simple missions to scare away everyone, or a sandbox mode - Just for the fun of it all.Whatever the case, you'll spend hours enjoying building your team, toying with the mortals or just trying to do the missions, in the end it is well worth the price. If you're not entirely sure even then, it goes on sale quite often and you can pick it up for incredibly cheap almost every steam sale.			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												Ghost Master is an absurdly old game and kinda reminds me of the Sims of it was crossed with Evil Genius.  You are a Master of Ghost, they are yours to control.  You have spesfic locations that require your hauntings and the peramaters change between locations from 'Scare everyone' to 'Scare no one and compleate this objective'  Each ghost has a spesfic 'fetter' or requirement to place, some are as loose as Inside and Outside, some are more spesfic like Electrical, Violence, Murder, Corpse, Child, meaning you have to better adapt for each situation, levels are replayable with ghost you have unlocked, the story is alot of fun and this is one game that truely deserves a sequal.  You should stop reading and be buying this right now.			",434,101,5,51,40,4,44

												This is one awesome game and I wish they would make an update, sequel or a remake of it.  You are the ghost master and are in control of where to place different ghosts with different abilites.  At the beginning of the level you select your team of ghosts and try to solve the problem for the level.  Might be something like having the authorites come to a certain room to find out about a previous murder, or scare everyone out of the building.  This game can be frustrating when you are trying to figure out what to do next, but it is hard to beat when everything is working.  If you like different kinds of puzzle & sim games I would highly recommend this one.  It is very original and fun.			",577,144,16,64,42,7,116

												I love details in this game like bio of people you are scaring, the story of places where you are scaring, stories of ghosts you can obtain in game. You can also get your goals multiple ways which is always nice. The graphics are not really that good but since its older game it's to be expected. You'll instantly fall in love with the sinister voice of your guide!Overall this game brings back memories of my early teen years and one of the first games I played. I love it and I really wish they'd make Ghost Master 2.			",41,25,0,9,15,1,3

												In Ghost Master, you command an army of ghosts and are trusted with completing an array of different objectives.The story takes place in Gravenville, a town where a lot of paranormal activity takes place, after a group of teenagers summons you – the Ghost Master.Before entering a haunting, you must choose which ghosts you take with you. You can pick anyone you want, but sometimes, especially when you are trying a level for the first time, it is better to press “Recommended” which will pick the best available ghosts in your army for said level.Once you’re in, there are 4 main features you must worry about: Haunters, Fetters, Plasm and Mortals. There are 47 playable ghosts and you can choose where to place them and which powers they can use. You can’t directly control them, so you need to learn when and which powers you want each of them to use and which orders to give (Allow a ghost to go after someone on its own or even use a certain power when no one is around). You start off by commanding a small army of classic horror characters, like the jack-of-all-trades ghost Boo or the glowing poltergeist Whirlweird. You will also be able to rescue restless spirits throughout the game (every level has at least one of these), increasing your army’s size and versatility. These trapped ghosts need to be set free but that is easier said than done. During the first levels, most ghosts are fairly easy to recruit; maybe you’ll need to destroy the fetter they’re on or scare someone they hated when they were alive. Later, though, there are a couple of complex puzzles you need to solve that require a lot of planning – make a certain person use a fetter or carry something across the building to a certain location. These are hard to figure out but extremely satisfying when solved.There are 6 kinds of ghosts in the game: Sprites, Disturbances, Elementals, Vapours, Frighteners and Horrors. Each type of ghost has a certain area of expertise. Sprites, for instance, consume little to no plasm (the game’s “resource”), which allows them to use most of their powers early on. They are usually bound to smaller fetters, usually electrical, and can make them malfunction and cause blackouts or power surges. Horrors and Frighteners, on the other hand, consume large amounts of plasm and can terrorize mortals like no one else can. They can possess humans and materialize into gruesome sights, making them useful to get rid of humans who are harder to scare.Ghosts can also level up; the more you use a certain ghost in the field, the higher its training level. Higher levels mean you will be able to give said ghost a bigger number of ever more complex orders, making its powers more effective and allowing you to let it haunt on its own, while you focus on something else. There are 8 training levels for each ghost.Fetters are where you can place your ghosts. You can’t just simply place them wherever you want, which makes planning ahead and ambushing something to consider. Certain ghosts can only be bound to mirrors, for example, making them very useful if used strategically, while others can be bound to sleeping mortals, children, water or even emotional objects.There are 2 kinds of plasm. Normal and gold. Regular plasm is something you need to summon ghosts and to use their powers. The stronger the ghosts, the more plasm they need to be bound to a fetter and the harder it gets to manage used and available plasm. Plasm is not spent – rather, you allocate an amount of available plasm to a ghost. If you need a certain haunter to use a more powerful spell, you can just unsummon one of the other fettered ghosts so the used plasm doesn’t surpass the maximum amount of available resources or make it use a weaker power which does not use as much plasm. Scaring people is the only way of earning a bigger plasm threshold – that is quite simple and straight forward when you need to scare all the mortals away from a level; on the other hand, when you get to levels where you can’t scare any of them away or you have a more subtle objective that doesn’t involve scaring, it is a rather tense experience. It is all a matter of balance. Failing to do so will have you banned from the mortal realm and you’ll have to try again.Gold Plasm can be used to buy new powers for your ghosts. You can usually choose different powers for ghosts in the same category, making a more versatile army. Gold Plasm is earned by completing levels and time trials.Each mortal has a Terror (Red), Belief (Blue) and Madness (Yellow) bar. Some powers cause belief; mortals with low belief are less affected by terror – so you’ll want to increase all sceptics’ belief before attacking them with your terror powers; this will generate more plasm – so you can power-up stronger powers or bind more haunters. You can also take over a human’s mind, making them go insane. People with phobias or older individuals are more susceptible to this. When a mortal’s willpower reaches its Terror or Madness cap, mortals will either flee or go crazy. Mad mortals provide great entertainment and can also help you – terrorizing the rest of their fellow humans with their insane actions. A big part of humans you use to your advantage is fear – conscious and subconscious. All mortals have them. There are some powers that allow you to uncover said fears. When you know what a certain person is afraid of, you’ll be able to use powers which are absurdly more effective than most others. If someone is afraid of blood, for instance, you can just attract the mortal to a bathroom and use a power that turns water into blood, or make it come out of the walls or even flood the whole room with it. Same goes for spiders, darkness, being trapped or even loud noises.Fortunately, mortals are not defenseless. You will meet humans that can banish your ghosts from the mortal realm, thus, making them unusable until the end of the haunting. From witches that summon protective circles, to exorcists, you’ll have to battle with all of them to be successful.Mortals’ AI isn’t all that great; they get stuck fairly often and they tend to do the opposite of what you want them to do. Pathfinding is also an issue when the action takes place in smaller areas.You do feel like you are haunting a small town because some of the characters you meet during the first levels will show up later in different locations and they also have the same fears and personalities.Levels are extremely well designed and varied– Mortals have a lot of escape routes to temporarily run away from your ghosts and you will need to improvise new tactics and approaches because humans will react to pretty much everything you do.Graphics are colorful and the game doesn’t take itself too seriously – which is quite refreshing, in my opinion. It is quite rare for a game about being a ghost and scaring people to embrace such a tongue-in-cheek, comedic approach.Ghost Master also features a soundtrack I consider perfect. It sets the right atmosphere from the very beginning and I still listen to it from time to time.This game pays clear homage to classic horror tropes; you’ll get the ghost bride that was left at the altar and even the headless horseman who was killed during the civil war. As you can see, movie references are scattered all over the game and characters and levels are smartly named “after” classic movies –“Phantom of the Operating Room” / “Blair Wisp Project”.A game that I recommend to everyone. It may look a little bit dated and it may have flimsy AI, but Ghost Master is an inventive game that brings us new gameplay mechanics and is undeniably a game brought to us by people who love and care for their work. The attention to detail and the countless amount of movie references and replay value make it my favorite game of all time.Final Score: 9 out of 10.			",298,69,7,24,21,3,31

												Definently worth the cheap price of $5 it's currently listed at.A strategical game where your target is to scare everyone until they run away in fear. You control a set of ghosts with different abilities & properties, you unlock ghosts as you progress and can upgrade them in different ways.It gets increasingly difficult and you need to use your wits, imagination & curiosity to solve the different little puzzles on the levels in order to get a human to do the tasks you want it to do :)			",624,186,31,122,103,5,152

												This game is an instant classic. You won't see any scaring games being released around this era of gaming.Ghost Master is game where you bind and equip ghosts into the houses/places of people you want to scare. You can also unlock new ghosts that are somewhat trapped in the houses you try to clear out. The game offers not just scaring out of the blue but it also makes use of certain situations like for example if the residents are non-believers then you have initiate a certain event like a hidden dead body to be spotted by the residents. By doing so, they will slowly become vulnerable to your scaring tactics and powers. Each ghost has its own specialty and powers and their binding points depend whether they are fitted for indoors, outdoors, or both. You can also train your ghosts so that they can learn new powers or enhance their scaring abilities. It's your choice of strategy whether how you want to scare the current residents. The main goal of the game is to scare out all the residents from the house. I recommend this game to anyone who loves the classic scaring games genre.NOTE: If you want this game, you should buy it during a sale. This game is more likely to be on sale during the Fall Sale.

												It's a shame that many people aren't aware of Ghost Master because it's a great game. If you were one of those people who enjoyed tormenting sims in The Sims, then this game is for you. If you're a person who likes paranormal or ghost themed video games, then this game is for you. If you enjoy light strategy and puzzle solving, then this game is for you. The game cost me less than a dollar and I've put 25 enjoyable hours into it. There are dozens of ghosts to experiment with and each can be upgraded, adding a degree of personalization to the way you tackle missions. The game is over a decade old, but while the visuals aren't anything to write home about the stylistically cartoonish art direction means that it hasn't aged poorly.I'm sure initial perceptions of the game are that it is a casual shovelware title, but it's to your detriment if you write it off thinking so. Give it a try the next time you have a dollar from selling trading cards during the next sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had hours of fun playing this game and I was very glad to see it on steam so I could enjoy replaying it. At its heart the game is resource management, you manage your ghost's power's from a shared meter, which you can increase by scaring mortals, which in turn you manage so that they are capable of being manipulated to fulfil your goals while providing you with enough power. However, despite that sounding somewhat dry, the game is wholeheartedly fun. Your ghosts are fun, their powers are fun, the mortals are fun and terrifying them out of their wits is always fun! The game does have pop culture references that are probably a bit out of date now, and the graphics won't even manage to stand up to those of a modern tablet but the game is emersive, challenging, funny and intuitive to control. I will confess that I probably am wearing rose tinted glasses when I play this game, and probably shouldn't give it such a glowing review, but I'd still recommend it ... just because it's fun!

												As a ""Ghost Master"", you recruit a team of ghosts for each mission to rid the residence of mortals and in turn gain new ghosts and skills to progress through the game. There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths and weaknesses. The spooks that work for you fall under six categories: sprites, disturbances, elementals, vapours, frighteners, and horrors named after their characteristics and skills. Skills can range from ""Rattle Chains"" and ""Fog"" to ""Ghostly Apparition"" and ""Paralyze"". Some ghosts are more beneficial in certain situations than others depending on the mission. Each time you scare a mortal you will increase your plasm; the energy that's needed to frighten them to begin with (ghost skills cost plasm to use). Scare them too much and people will flee from the building before all your goals are met, which can make your job more difficult. Mortals also have their own levels of belief, terror, and madness rendering them at times irrational, afraid or even insane! That can affect gameplay for the ghosts assigned to haunt them.  Watch out for  priests, witches, mediums and ghostbreakers, these humans have the ability to banish your ghosts until the misson is over. Missions can be both fun & humorous, poking fun at movies and TV shows (Titles like eg. Ghostbreakers, Poultrygeist, and Phantom of the Operating Room). Once the goals for a level have been met, the game rates your progress. It factors in time, the impact on the mortals your ghosts haunted, and how many mortals fled. If you completed the mission fairly quickly, a multiplier is added to the final score. This score relates the amount of ""Gold Plasm"" given, which can now be used to add more skills to spook crew!****A very unique, funny and highly enjoyable game! Loved it and fully recommend it! Wish they would update it with a remake!****			",51,156,0,53,6,1,19

												Childhood memory.My dad bought me a CD version in 2003, I was 14 year old at that moment.I could barely finish stage 5 and I got stuck, I love this game, but my gaming ability at 14 seemed not enough to solve the complicated mechanism of this game.When i grew up, i had lost the disc of the game. And i feel sad that i didnt have chance to finish what i could want in my childhood.10 years later, I found this game on STEAM and I bought it without any consideration.Although 13 years has passed, I still feel a lot of fun when playing.The mechansim of game and the design is far more superior to others game back to 2000s.Even nowadays, you cant find such a game with similar theme as well as the mechansim.Fans of game has made Ghost Master 2, however, ghost master 1 is still the only master piece.The game is not expensive, if you are boring because nth to play,I hope you will give GHOST MASTER a try.It wont fail you.

												A neat gem of a game from the past that I think would be worth your time and money, Ghost Master explores a concept that will maybe remind you of Dungeon Keeper and other games where you are the ""bad guy"". In this case, you'll control a group of ghosts, called ""haunters"", in an attempt to scare the hell out of mortals. It's a Strategy/Puzzle game, and some missions require you to complete different tasks from scaring. Most of these special tasks involve using mortals to interact with certain objects that your ghosts can't use (not correctly, at least). All the ghosts are unique as each one of them as their starting skills and base behaviour (altough many details are never addressed by the game, it's something you pick up with experience). All of them have their special fetter, or a place where you can ""bind"" them, or summon them in the livings' world. Fetters vary from free roaming to being linked to a peculiar condition, with varying rarity. Often, strict links mean powerful ghosts. Most of the ghosts will be locked at the beginning, and will need to be rescued during missions. Each one of them as its unique rescuing requirement. But I already spoiled too much, I'll let your curiosity take over and try out this little art piece ;).			",117,11,0,7,8,0,6

												This is one of these games you return to every few years simply because there's no game like it (although I believe there was a game on kickstarter, forgot the name, tell me if you know it). Ghost Master gives you the controll of several ghosts, demons, poltergheists etc. and your goal is simple; scare every human in the level. Each mission you will have to choose the ghosts to work with. Your ghosts all have different abilities and may take controll of various household equipment and other stuff in order to scare the **** out of the npc's. The game is not very difficult unless you want a 100% score each mission.Obviously, since the game was released back in 2003, the graphics are not top notch but since it's played from a top-down view it shouldn't be that big of a problem.At the moment of writing, the game is only 75 cents (normal price: 5,-) so you can't really go wrong there.

												Are you one of those people who played The Sims just to torment your little residents? Because I think someone made Ghost Master just for you. As the titular master of ghosts, you take an assortment of spooks and specters into different homes and buildings with the intent of driving out the residents. Each ghost has specific things it can haunt, like electronics or damp things, and several powers that unlock as you scare more and more people. There are also ghosts you can recruit during missions by completing certain tasks, foes to overcome like police and ghostbuster-types, and high scores to shoot for in each level. There are some clever locales to haunt too, like sorority houses, mystery mansions, cabins in the woods, schools, and more.The game plays like a cross between real-time strategy and puzzle. You can give your ghosts orders and have to manage your spooking power between them, but scaring off mortals and completing tasks is more a matter of getting the right ghost in the right place. It's a terribly charming little game that is unfortunately starting to show its age, and can be a bit frustrating if certain people or ghosts don't path the way you need them to. Since you have no direct control over movement, tasks that require specific placement can be a chore to complete. Minor gripes aside, this a is perfect lighthearted game for the season, and one that most likely anyone can enjoy.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Any fool with a proton pack can bust ghosts, but can you ♥♥♥♥ing MASTER some ghosts? Do you have the ectoplasmic BALLS, the paranormal GONADS to MASTER some spooks?Seriously though, this game is fantastically terrible, well worth the ticket price. Get this game, it goes on sale every holiday.It plays like reverse Sims. All your Sims are already dead and you have to scare everyone out of the house. You play as a Ghost Master, a ""bio-exorcist"" a la Beetlejuice. Your haunts are zoned off rooms and ghosts must be summoned on ""fetters"", things that bind them to the mortal plane. Summoning ghosts costs ectoplasm as well as interacting with the physical world. As you cause trembling mortals to void their bowels with terror, you build more ectoplasm. More ectoplasm means more ghosts, and more terrifying ghost powers. Lastly, while you're haunting a place, you may encounter local ghosts who are bound to something in the house. Free them and you have more ghosts to join your legion.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is fun. I don't know if it's just my love for ghosts, but for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, no name developer, game there's quite a bit of fun to be had. There's only one big down side to this game. Often, you must rely on humans, who you have no direct control over, to do something so that you can continue. This can take a LONG time. The last level take like an hour of just random luck, waiting for some poor sap to pick up a present and carry it upstairs. In another level, you have to wait a full 20 minutes for some random human to decide to use the bathroom.Get this game. You will be THE GHOST MASTER.			",308,83,4,26,25,3,17

												I love this game. The idea of Ghostbusters reversed is hilarious. The missions are funny and various, so are the ghost and their powers (I especially recommend ghosts' epitaphs!). You can easily develop your own strategy and improve your favorite ghosts. It also has great soundtrack :) When I was a kid it actually helped me to get rid of my fears - whenever I heard some strange noise in the house or had a bad dream, I just thought ""oh, it was just Boo trying to scare me"". Ghost Master is a great game for 1) everybody who hates mortals, 2) everybody who hates Ghostbusters, 3) everybody who loves Ghostbusters, 4) scared kids, 5) everybody who likes screaming, 6) everybody who likes transparent materials, 7) everybody who wants to watch the world burn.

												Sadly, rather little known but an amazing game about.. well.. ghosts.The game resembles sims, but without any stupid need to take about little people. No, you actually get to disrupt their routine and provide them with a fresh new set of nightmares, all free of charge!The big guy, reaping his own head in half and bleeding all across the room to scare mortals?Caspersque ghost spooking people by chasing them across the building?The large spider which makes arachnophobia entire new level of scary?Well, that and dozens of other spirits at your command with only thing on their ectoplasmic minds - to make lives of pathetic mortals as scary as possible. Definitely worth a try, especially for it's low price!			",47,12,0,22,5,3,24

												Scaring The Sims like characters is what this game is about. You put together a team of ghosts and will have to scare people away from the map you are playing and also unlock other ghosts that are trapped there. Unlocking new ghosts can sometimes put your mind to the test.Its a really fun and cheap game. The AI is not top notch, but it works. It has a RPG element that allows you to buy new skills for your ghosts. And theres alot of ghosts and scare abilities.I totally recommend this game if you are looking for a fun Puzzle game that is cheap. Even though the game isnt really long, it can take some time to aquire every single ghost.			",79,15,0,14,19,0,15

												It has been over a decade now since this game was released and still to this day, I haven't given up the desire for a sequal. It's a bit hard to get used to, but very satisfying when you get a handle on it; the only downside I feel it has is that the ending was still left open, especially since the DLC that gave it an actual ""ending"" never released on steam. It deserves one, if not an ironic ressurection, for a game about ghosts.			",215,21,1,21,17,1,25

												I played this a lot before I even started using Steam so my hours played is probably nearer 30.Ghost Master is a refreshing change from most games in that it's fairly unique, it's hardly supernatural or spooky, it's far to cute for that but it's good fun teaming up your spirits and giving the group of mortals the wombo combo of their ghostly abilities until they start freaking out.The games premise, create a team of supernatural entities to scare away a group of mortals, makes it sound relatively simple like a game ported from a tablet or mobile.  It's much more than that though.   It looks good for a top down 3D game, it plays well and I've only ever seen one bug.  It has reasonable replayability trying different teams in different scenarios and the scoring system is pretty good. Fun little game to play occasionally and even though it's 13 years old, it doesn't look or act it's age.			",81,10,1,8,15,5,21

												Ignore the bad reviews.I have experienced no glitches. I've shown people the game while playing, nothing screwed up. The game runs fine. The concept is pretty cool. The people are dumb, and you screw with them as they investigate their surroundings - which is supposed to resemble real life ""walking around the house"" behavior but is a bit more active. Speaking of active, you're not ""a"" ghost - you're about a half dozen at a time. You have acheivements to unlock in each level, which you do by placing ghosts in rooms and hallways and yards to screw with characters.Just give it a try. There's not much content, you'll be through the game in a few short days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most innovative and timeless games in existence. The lack of balance in the gameplay is outweighed by the hilariously funny situations the game can produce. A classic which is definitely worth playing!The few things I didn't like in this game: First, throughout the game, just scaring mortals away is much easier than driving them mad which in effect is much more fun. I've played the game throught once and I managed to get just two mortals mad. Second, the targeted finish time is set arbitrarily. While playing the main plot I never managed to beat the time to get some more gold plasma. I'm sure that with ALL ghosts in the ghoul castle I will be able to scare the hell out of mortals more effectivelly. But without them it takes frustratingly long to finish a level, not to speak of beating the time limit.Third, and the most annoying, where is the SEQUEL? Or a REMAKE at least, to make the wrongs right? The ideas in this game are priceless. I just don't understand why there are no similar games, especially concerning the settings and style.

Ghost Master is a real time game in which you assemble a team of haunters to scare off mortals and release trapped spirits to join your cause. You start out with a handful of ghosts to send a group of college girls screaming from their sorority house. Over time, you get to recruit spirits to tackle more challenging scenarios.Many of the characters and scenarios in this game are inspired by TV shows, movies, and comics. Recognizing these pop culture references may get you chuckling. I’ve spotted references to The Evil Dead, Casper, Ghostbusters, The Three Stooges, and many more. The whole concept of gathering ghosts to scare off mortals makes this game immensely fun, especially when plenty of humor is thrown in. It certainly helps that many of the scenarios are cleverly designed.Despite all the good things going for this game, some of the fun is sapped out of it when trying to figure out what powers should be activated to get mortals to do certain actions. For example, in one scenario, you need to send three mortals to a cabin to complete a ritual, but the mortals would first have to find a way to cross a raging river and a deep chasm. Since the solution to these and other problems isn’t always obvious, you may need to experiment with different powers before making headway.This wouldn’t have been a problem if not for the fact that mortals move around the map randomly like characters in The Sims. Some will use the bathroom, take a drink of water, or converse with their friends at random moments. While it does seem natural to have mortals behaving in this manner, it doesn’t help if you have to wait a long time for a mortal to do a particular action, such as bringing a gift to a specific room. If you aren’t even sure that what you’re attempting will work as intended, then having to wait more than a minute becomes an exercise in frustration.Even with these problems, Ghost Master is highly entertaining. If scaring the bejesus out of little computer people sounds like fun (and believe me, it is), do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy now.For a more in-depth review, see my blog page[standoutgames.blogspot.com].

												This game is a hidden gem. You have an arsenal of ghosts available to you and you want to scare people in a Sims type environment. The game starts of great with a cheesy fmv, you get to scare people in different ways with different ghosts.Unfortunately, they took it a step too far for me. The third and fourth mission were very puzzly. You needed to use certain ghosts in certain situations or you wouldn't be able to progress. I completed the third mission a little bit aggrevated because you needed to guide people to certain locations which was a chore. The mission after that was straight up ""use this ghost in this situation to trigger this event, then use another ghost to do this and that"".I wish they just kept it to scaring people and didn't make you solve puzzles. There is depth in just scaring people since certain people are scared of certain things.I wouldn't recommend it if you're not into the puzzles. Still, it's quite an unique game and I might persevere to see if things change.EDIT: I made it to the final mission before I became too frustrated to continue. As expected, most of the later missions are puzzle based and can be quite frustrating without a guide (in some cases even with a guide). The final mission is completely bonkers, in a bad way. You're reliant on luck for a correct scenario to occur and you pretty much need a certain secret ghost to complete it.If you do pick this up, I would recommend using a guide if you're feeling frustated. Unfortunately even with a guide I was able to get stuck in a mission because I didn't have the proper ghost power to proceed. My only options were to go replay a previous mission and unlock a secret ghost that had that ghost power or go buy it for one of my existing ghosts (which wasn't an option as I already spent my coin for powers on other ghosts). I ended up editing my game with a save game editor to get that power.This game was an unique experience. Gameplay mechanics were great, the strong focus on puzzles was a letdown.

												Ghost Master is a joy to play once more...Pick your team and go haunt those silly mortals...maybe even drive them insane. As you complete more hauntings you are awarded gold plasma to level your team up with to make them even more terrifying. Go visit YOUR ghost mansion to do so between your fiendish hauntings.And if you don't have enough gold plasma from your hauntings...go re-haunt (replay) to improve your ghastly plasma rewards. Just click on the pumpkin on the screen with all your possible hauntings if you didn't know. ;)Just be aware of those mortals who can banish your ghostly team...how very dare they, go scare them!  :P			",3,17,0,5,14,0,7

												Ghost Master is a game most people have never heard of. In fact, even during its release in 2003 it never received much publicity or commercialism. This is because it wasn't really a ""big project"" in the first place. Basically no one ever heard of Sick Puppies, the developing company, because they had only released one other game before: Pipe Dreams 3D, two years prior to this game. Sick Puppies remained true to its name in the business due to the fact they were, well, a sick company. They disbanded only a year after the release of Ghost Master, though to this day the game still has a cult following, and for very good reasons.Ghost Master is an extremely original game, with unique, haunting and spiritual music (of which is perhaps my favorite aspect of this game), gameplay and level design. You play the role of a Ghost Master, which is basically just a name for you as you scroll around in this RTS 3D world and try to best command the spirits in your arsenal to accomplish certain objectives - mostly involving the casting of ""spells"" (powers) to scare mortals until they run away from the level, earning you victory when all mortals are gone - or else left insane, which I might add is hard to do, but really funny to see. The abilities of your ghosts depend on the individual and type, and you can unlock more ghosts by playing levels and finding ""restless spirits"" which you can talk to, and they give you a quest-like objective which you must find a way to complete before you finish their unfinished business, or else free them.The diversity and imagination of the ghosts themselves is really interesting as many are inspired by many spiritual cultures and myths, or even pop-culture as some are obvious parodies of famous horror movies. Some ghosts are elementals, others are Gremlins, which are the wild spirits of animals, and others are poltregiests, the tortured spirits of humans who were once mortals. Each ghost has a unique mini-profile with an amusing backstory, and a semi-unique set of powers you can purchas as training with the points you earn for completing levels. This currency is called Gold Plasm.Every ghost has a specific kind of fetter (a place or a type of thing) they can bind themselves to at your command when playing a level, based on their type or perhaps how they died. This also can relate to how a restless spirit might be trapped in a level, waiting for you to free them and unlock them. One of my more favorite spirits was an air elemental named Whisperwind, a fairy-like being who was trapped in a dream-catcher which you have to destroy. The game itself is quite tacky with its graphics, but at the same time the art style and atmosphere sends a very good at making you feel immersed in the creepiness of it all. It's easy to imagine how scared the mortals must be of you, walking around in all those locations you haunt because of how weirdly mystical everything seems, though you will sometimes still chuckle at the plastic hair of mortals and french-fry fingers of some of your ghosts with all their silly low quality models. The gameplay, as mentioned before, is extremely unique, as I've never seen a single game to this day that really has the same kind of mechanics you see in this classic gem. However, the game is also quite buggy sometimes, and I can't promis you you wont ever flip your table in rage due to mortals not doing what you want them to. This is the most frusterating part of the game, because manipulating the mortals into doing something or triggering something is usually the only way to unlock new ghosts as you use them to do something to set other spirits free. An example of frustration would be this one ghost of a murdered sales woman, whom would be unlocked after you help her with her unfinished business by lurring a woman to her makeup tray which was resting on a table near her hidden corpse. For some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason, the woman would actually use this product despite all the dust and the DEAD BODY, but the real trick is getting the female mortal to notice it. It takes several different lurring spells, and for what ever reason, this is the one ghost I have the most trouble saving because it's completely random. I've literally tried for hours sometimes to get her and the mortals keep glitching out and avoiding her room too soon, but then other times I get her unlocked WITH OUT EVEN DOING ANYTHING! That's right, sometimes, when there's a blue moon out in real life, and the stars align perfectly for you, your objectives for a few certain things in the game may be accomplished COMPLETELY ON THEIR OWN with no prompt from you. The game is stupid like this sometimes. Mortals will also teleport sometimes. When starting a level, first you select your ghosts. You use their powers to manipulate the environment and the mortals to complete various objectives, but it always ends with you scaring them all off. You assign your spirits a room or area based on their fetters - a gremlin for example will stay at any electronic you bind him to. In doing this, you strategize by looking at the path-finding patterns of the mortals to see how to lay traps. Some fetters however are semi-mobile, as in, a mortal may pick your object up and carry your spirit somewhere else. To stop this, just make your ghost scare that person. Almost every level, even without the ghosts, is a giant refference to a famous horror story or novel. You will play a parody of The Amityville Horror, Sleepy Hollow and Blair Witch for example. The game is a strange mix of humor and horror involving tacky and almost slap-stick themes while at the same time having a disturbingly chilling environment at times. This is perhaps one of the game's strongest qualties - the combination of a spooky atmosphere, fun gameplay and a light air of occasional black comedy that keeps the player on their toes as they enjoy the ride - up until at some point they trip and fall over due to one of the game's occasionally irritatingly hard levels. This game isn't perfect, and sometimes you *will* get mad at it. In the end, I think it's still a great classic and a shame that no sequels are being made. Not officially anyway. Though some indi developers are trying somewhat to get something going (you can find them easily by googling Ghost Master 2), there's no telling if they'll ever really finish, as very little is shown so far. Right now, Ghost Master is availabe to everyone here at the stock price of 5 USD, which in my opinion is a great price. It's definetly not a fancy game. It doesn't have amazing graphics (despite its interesting theme and art style), it's kind of glitchy sometimes, and hardly anyone knows about it and the developing company is literally dead now. If you're still unsure about this game, then wait for halloween. In all the time I've been on Steam, I've seen Ghost Master go on sale for 1.50 USD or so every single time, as one of the first things to go on sale. That's practically making this game free, and once its in your hands, it's easy to get addicted to. It has decent replayability, and I've finished it like 5 times already in all the time I've had this game. I actually grew up with this, but I lost the disc and recently saw the game for sale here. It was so cheap, I couldn't resist just getting it again.PS: Look for the popular All Ghosts Mod which brings very welcome rebalancing to the game's level select. Also, this game works for me on Windows 10, but some may have to use work-arounds.			",262,34,0,28,22,2,32

												A puzzle-based simulation with a twisted sense of humor. Loads of ghosts, each one unique in its own way, give you a wide variety of ways to terrify mortals in a range of settings. The graphics are simple but sufficient and the fun more than makes up for it. Not the longest game in the world but enough gameplay for the low price. If you ever enjoyed walling up your Sims and driving them insane or if you miss the torture pits of Dungeonkeeper, this is a game for you.			",179,72,1,33,36,0,14

You might be a psychopath. Do you enjoy old ""B"" horror movies, but wish that you could be the one to drive them insane? Play Ghost Master now, a game about haunting stupid people in hopes that they'll make a sequel. SPOILER ALERT: They arent going to make a sequel.			",97,14,0,21,25,2,23

There's so many elaborate details, it's mesmerising! I really feel like I am being spooked by the ghosts when I play the game, it's atmospheric.Sound:Musa Ali, the sound effects in this game make me stay up all night. They sound so realistic and they really terrify me. It's amazing how spooky it is.Music:The music is absolutely great. It's so original, there are a lot of different songs and they're all extremely spooky!Overall:This game is one of the best games of all time. It's simply... THE BEST!10/10			",99,17,1,17,9,0,17

												I want to like this game.  I really, really do.The concepts are solid, the visuals are very good and the senarios are intriguing.  It makes you wonder what could have been if there had been more planning and polish.However, a few levels in it becomes a punishing experience because you are often at the mercy of the clumbsy AI pathfinding and baffling level design that more often than not makes things much more frustrating than they have to be.  Combine that with poorly explained goals that only get worse as you go along, and you get a game that just isn't worth playing to completion.			",180,38,0,42,24,0,18

												Train ghosts to scare people and get them to flee the building. Each ghost has a variety of powers at start and you can unlock more over time with gold plasma you earn from your scares. You earn plasma by scaring the people but it also costs plasma to use your ghost's powers. Each level also has a spirit you can unlock by discovering how you free it. I played through the tutorial and saw it has a lot to unlock and each ghost can grow better at scaring the more you use them. This can be a great game for someone who likes management type sim games but just not for me.			",2440,1022,86,323,253,20,376

												Being a Ghost Master is crazy fun. Scarring poor little Sim-like people into running screaming from their homes is all to satisfying. The game is incredibly detailed giving you so many haunters to choose from and bios on all your little victims. The whole game is complete with some creative little puzzles and handfuls of horror movie references to keep me happy. It’s also ridiculously cheesy (which is always plus in my book).

												Not for everyone. Reminds me of Dungeon Keeper in a lot of ways, I like the premise, and I like how the atmosphere is what drives the gameplay.That said, tactical feedback is a problem. If you didn't play this as a child, which I didn't, and so don't remember the solution, you will spend a lot of time having no idea if what you're doing is working. Is fear not rising because this ghost isn't working, or because the humans are just hanging out in the doorway and technically aren't inside the range of the power he's using? Is this spirit not getting freed because the power i'm trying to use isn't the right one, or because the humans just haven't gotten around to reacting to it yet? It's like a point and click style item guessing puzzle, except sometimes the right answer doesn't work the first five or six times you try it, and I can see how that would be frustrating.

												A simple game with a nice story wich can be listened to, or just necklect the story and scare the hell out of some puny humans. Either way you can have alot of fun with this old game. This game has proven that its a classic and altough it may seem a bit outdated, it is still one of my favorites and I bet alot of you guys/girls will love it as well.			",38,2,0,6,6,0,3

												This is one of the best haunting simulators I've ever played! Instead of busting the Ghosts, you play as the actual haunters and the only goal is to scare all the mortals off the property. There are different properties to play on, and each one has an assortment of ghosts that are trapped. If you free these ghosts they will come over to your side and help you.Such a great game! I only wish the compatibility issues were fixed, because it can be a real pain trying to get this to run on modern machinery; but once you do you're going to have a fun-filled evening!

												A very unique puzzle/strategy game where you have to use Ghost to guess what - scare off mortals.... at least most of the time. Sometimes you have different objectives too.You can also rescue other ghosts to increase the number of your astral army.Unfortunately the game can get very annoying, especially when many puzzles depend on really broken AI or what human characters should do. Many times they get stuck into walls, objects or teleport or they just gonna stand still. In the worst cases - you gonna need to restart level.Despite all that - Ghost Masters is a very fun and enjoyable game.Its get very cheap on sales so worth of checking out.Also it have more real Ghostbusters than movie from 2016.

												Great game. Really sad to see it not aswell known. Played the game 5 years ago and it's still fun and fresh now. Good graphics for a 2003 game fully 3D but wont give systems today any problems. 15 challenging levels (Plus a bonus mission, UK only i think) that all have some special element to them. Funny and witty and great puns to classic horror films.Don't take the game serious, it's a light hearted game that can give you hours of fun plus great humor. any downside? possibly one and thats prepare to do serveral maps twice as they re-use the areas but they are always changed such as ammount of people and/or objective. I give this game 9/10- Dean			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A old game, but definantly fun and worth the small price. You play as the ghost master, commanding ghosts and going on missions to scare hapless mortals and rescue trapped ghosts, but the mortals are not without their defences. Beware of Mediums, Witches and the Ghost Breakers (cause clearly breakin' makes you feel good) who will hunt down your ghosts and attempt to exorcise them from the haunting location.This is a game I would love to see a sequal to as there are things that need a bit of altering to it with not much re-play value apart from attaining new powers by revisiting levels and scaring the wits out of people, which is always entertaining.

												This game is seriously fun. While it had technical issues working with newer rigs, since my last computer upgrade (and being reminded it existed by a Steam sale) I reinstalled and its working great. Hadn't played it in well over a decade when this was cutting edge stuff.It's a fun mix of problem solving, dark humor, and strategy. Just a few levels in and I'm already replaying levels- nostalgia aside, this is a quality game.If you can get it on sale, buy it immediately. If you can't, it is one of those older games that I'd still say is worth the asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for a new twist on ghoulies, ghosties, long-legged beasties, and things that go bump in the night, look no further than Ghost Master. Sick Puppies' real-time strategy game stands horror-game traditions on their heads, swapping the spooks and scares of Resident Evil and Silent Hill for supernatural management duties reminiscent of Dungeon Master. It's a great novelty, first of all, but it's also a real success in terms of gameplay, thanks to outstanding scenario design and an irreverent sense of humor.Some of the haunting stunts you can pull are straight out of Ghostbusters.Some of the haunting stunts you can pull are straight out of Ghostbusters.The core elements of Ghost Master are simple. Reverse the stereotypical ghost story and you have a pretty good idea what this game is all about. Unlike in your garden-variety horror game, where you wander the halls of a haunted house waiting to be frightened into a fresh pair of BVDs, here you're some kind of dead civil servant (insert ""are there any other kind?"" or similar joke here) in charge of the rattling chains and disembodied footsteps. Problems in the small town of Gravenville have attracted the notice of the Haunter Committee, and you're sent to set things right by generally scaring the bejesus out of the flesh-and-blood types.You do this by recruiting a team of ghosts for each scenario. This spook squad is drawn from six categories--sprites, disturbances, elementals, vapours, frighteners, and horrors--named for the chief characteristics and skills of their members. The sprites class, for instance, consists of minor spirits who mess up electrical appliances, like the cogjammer gremlin and the ghostly spider, clatterclaws. Elementals features aether and earthwall, who have the capabilities of air and earth elementals, respectively. Horrors represents the worst of the worst, such as the mortal-possessing ghastly and the headless horseman. Every sort of spook that's ever made type B-positive run down the walls in a fright flick is at your beck and call here.Using your team in the field is a balancing act. Ghosts must be fettered to specific objects, so you can't spread them all over the map. Gremlins have to be attached to electronic appliances, such as microwaves and televisions. Apparitions, shadows, and wraiths are stuck to murder scenes. Weatherwitches and headless horsemen are linked to thoroughfares like hallways and roads. And so on.Role-playing concerns also crop up. While certain types of ghosts are necessities in some situations, there's a benefit to using the same spooks in multiple missions, because they gain experience and become easier to control. They can also be upgraded with new skills, which are purchased in the ghoul room with the gold plasm awarded at the end of each successful scenario. Managing your spook squad is about more than just picking the right ghoul for the job.Few things will scare homeowners as much as revealing rotting corpses in boarded-up rooms.Few things will scare homeowners as much as revealing rotting corpses in boarded-up rooms.Regular plasm consumption is another issue. This is the sole resource in the game, powering your ability to manifest ghosts and all their spectral abilities. Overtax yourself and you can run out of this vital substance, a dire scenario that ends the current haunt and throws you out of the mortal realm. Plasm is earned by scaring people, forcing you to keep a focus on screams and shudders even when the scenario objectives involve something more subtle than driving residents out of their homes.Even with these physical anchors and resource restrictions, a lot of moving around is required. For starters, your victims don't stand still. Humans in the game communicate in thought balloons and gibberish voices, much like those in The Sims, and are rated in terms of belief, terror, and madness. Build their belief that something out of the ordinary is going on and you'll be able to terrify them or drive them mad. Affect either of the latter categories through something like an eerie laugh, a chill wind blowing through a sealed room, or a ghost playing peekaboo, and the victim will flee, forcing you to adjust your tactics. They even have individual fears, like lightning or insects, which can be revealed with powers like know aura and then used to your advantage.People will run out of rooms, go from one floor to another, and even dash into the backyard or street to get away from your ghosts, so you need to keep up the assault by locating new fetters. After a little time on each level, you'll get an idea of your victims' escape routes. The level design typically includes lots of locations where you can set up traps to keep mortals so scared that they soon run off into the night or simply go nuts. Needless to say, you can derive a lot of sadistic glee from this. Put a ghastly in a living room, a spook and a cogjammer in a kitchen, and a weatherwitch in the hallway separating them and you can watch your victims slowly lose their minds as they go from one spine-tingling jolt to the next.Collect gold plasm and you can train your ghosts with different spooky skills.Collect gold plasm and you can train your ghosts with different spooky skills.The scenarios themselves are well designed and fairly plentiful (more than a dozen are spread across three acts). Most are more tongue-in-cheek than openly ghoulish, although there are lots of corpses to be unearthed amid the guffaws. All poke fun at movies and TV shows, both horror and mainstream. Scenario names include Ghostbreakers, Poultrygeist, and Phantom of the Operating Room, and plots have been lifted from movies like Evil Dead (faithfully adapted lock, stock, and Necronomicon) and Sleepy Hollow. Look closely at the names of your victims and you'll notice some surprises as well. The Haunting 101 tutorial mission, for example, sees you sending apparitions against Blair, Tootie, and their pals from the '80s sitcom The Facts of Life.There isn't really an overarching plot, though the people you scare in one scenario often show up in another. You really do get the sense that you're haunting a small town. For example, the Hutz family you haunted in The Calamityville Horror and the kids you drove away from their frat house in Weird Séance show up in the Gravenville police station in The Unusual Suspects. The only problem with this approach is that Gravenville is a little too small, seeing as you have to haunt some places more than once.The design goes beyond grade-school puns. Scenarios consist of a mixture of puzzles and straightforward rock-paper-scissors design elements, so that you're attempting to complete different objectives each time out. You scare jocks out of frat houses, unveil hidden corpses, assist university students with occult rites, convince a mob boss to believe in ghosts, frighten the locked-up criminals out of a police station, and so forth. Sometimes you even have to avoid scaring people away or driving them mad, as you need them in a lucid state so you can fulfill certain objectives. Puzzles are paramount, as the houses to be haunted always include fettered spirits that can be freed to join your ranks by accomplishing set goals. Some of these are fairly simple--to release Raindance from his toilet prison in the Evil Dead homage Summoners Not Included, all you have to do is clear some bees from in front of a Porta Potti, and to spring Sparkle in The Blair Wisp Project, you just need to start a campfire.About the only thing missing from Ghost Master is a multiplayer mode, although it's hard to imagine how Sick Puppies could have incorporated such an option into a puzzle-oriented title like this. And the game isn't exactly any poorer for the omission of multiplayer features, since the numerous missions and impressive replay value will keep it on your hard drive for quite some time.

I've just spent almost 4 hours trying to complete one mission and after numerous restarts, completely closing the game and even rebooting my computer I'm unable to finish it.A great concept horribly let down by pathetic AI path finding.

												I'm sure this is a cool game. The problem is, I'll never know because the game won't work for me. I'm not sure if it's a Windows 10 problem, or the game is just too old to work on a modern gaming pc. The first time I ran it, the game started, but the resolution was off and wouldn't allow me to reset it, change it, or do anything. The mouse pointer accuracy was way off too, as I had to move it a few inches down and to the right of whatever I wanted to select in order to select it. This only works to spell my name. I can't actually enter it because the button to do so doesn't have enough screen space by it for me to move my mouse in order to select it. So yeah. That's as far as I can get. Stuck at the name screen. How fun.I rebooted the computer. Changed the compatibility modes. Read the forums. And all I have managed to do is make the game angrier. It won't even load now. All it does is say it can't find steam. At least I can return it, but I would advise anyone to not buy this game unless your computer is old and running an old version of Windows maybe.

												I had a hardcopy of this years ago.  I played it through a couple of times, and I loved it each time.  It was challenging, funny, and I loved the movie references -- Funnily, a name of one of the levels became a movie a few years later (I'll let you figure out which one).  Though it looks superficially Sims-like, its definately an RTS.I wanted to play this again recently and couldn't find the disk, so I'm glad this is available on Steam.  The clincher to purchase was when I read that the bonus scenario is available on the Steam version.  On the original retail version, the bonus scenario was not available for the US version.If you want a twisted strategy game that will make you laugh, I would recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ghost Master is a whimsical strategy game where you command a team of ghosts and utilize their powers to achieve goals and more importantly, to scare the crap out of people in a variety of amusingly cruel ways. There are lots of different ghost types and powers, and it's fun to try them all out just to see what will happen. Ghost Master is a bit on the short side and there's no multiplayer, but while it lasts it's good fun.			",908,212,81,89,94,14,172

												There is nothing like this game out there. This game is unique.It takes inspiration from all sorts of games, but manages to be an experience no-one else has reproduced.You're tasked with using a troupe of ghosts to clear humans from different levels or solve puzzles, and while this may seem remeniscent of something like Dungeon Keeper, the methods are very hands off, with you simply placing ghosts and giving them orders, but never controlling them directly.It's a great shame it was such a commercial flop, as it's obviously a labour of love, and has a particularly British flavour reminding the player of other companies such as Rare, Lionhead, Bullfrog, Mucky Foot, etc.Well worth a few evenings of your time.I just hope you have better luck getting it to recognise widescreen monitors than I did.

												This is a fun twist on most games. Viewed isometrically, you control a variety of ghouls and spirits to haunt a variety of locations and drive the residents into fits of terror and into vacating the premises with much haste, and preferably screaming. A good game to play not just on halloween, but any occasion for anyone who wants to enjoy a game that's not too heavily paced and lets you experiment and discover things on your own. Lots of different ways to complete various levels, and new haunts to free and unlock for your own use, make this game intruiging, with a good replay value. Train your haunts with more abilities using gold plasm which you can earn from making people scream, faint, and flee. Discover your subject's deepest fears and utilize them to maximize their terror and send them screaming into the night. It's good to be evil.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

GHOST MASTER was one of those hidden gems that I have replayed god knows how many times and still has a lot of legs today.  It is joyous, funny, and occasionally frustrating -- but an amazing strategy title that is funny and well designed and at $5 or less you can't go wrong. . .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Quirky, fun game. Lots of references to the horror genre, a bit of strategy is required but half the time its just luck that wins you new ghosts and levels! Absolutely love it, highly recommend.

												I got this game on CD back in 2005, loved every minute of it.Also love coming back to it occasionally - even after all those years it's still perfectly playable.Sure, there's few bugs/glitches, but this is limited to the randomness of mortals movement.While this game is a lot of fun to play, some levels can pose a challenge, especially in the later levels, where you have to fight Ghostbusters and time itself. Some puzzles can also be hard, but the enslaved ghosts give enough tips to solve them.14 levels sure isn't much, but considering some can take even an hour it's still a great choice to fill up an entire day.Soundtrack is awesome, really fits the game. Graphics could be a little bit better, especially for 2003, but all in all it's still passable in 2016.If you haven't played this game yet and you enjoy being the bad guy sometimes - you can't miss this one.

Captains Log, 14.12.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Ghost Master. Well…what to write about this? You will underestimate what this game offers. You will avoid it because of its dated graphics. You may skip this one because you don´t feel like managing ghosts and scares is your thing. I am sorry to be the one to tell you this, but you are completely and utterly wrong!  First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Ghost Master looks like the Sims™. It has a lot of managing elements and analyzing elements that also appear in the Sims™. But let me assure you: This is a completely different game! You are the master of a host of spooks, wraiths, ghosts, apparitions and other ectoplasmatic eccentrics:The goal of the game is to scare different individuals or groups in varying settings. It can be a sorority house, a haunted house or an asylum. How cliché is that you say? A damn hell lot! And it works like a charm. Literally.You have to use different ghosts with different abilities during each mission to be able to scare all the people in the level. You can also try to unlock new ghosts for your scary bunch by solving “little puzzles/riddles” in each level. Sometimes you need to come back later to unlock a specific spook. That is not a bad thing! Managing the scaring is not an easy business. Some people are just not as easily scared as others. The “to be scareds” (TBS) have three bars that indicate their terror, madness and believe. They also have fears, sub conscious fears and moods. All of those stats influence the effectiveness of different scare attempts. Analyzing the area or setting, the situation the TBS are in, the different behaviors and movement patterns are all important to the success of your mission. And it does feel like every bit of information there is matters! It is not just added to look good. It works like clockwork. You can devise a strategy after dissecting the situation at hand and almost always get exactly what you ordered. No Luck in this game, just “simple” scare tactics. (couldn´t help it, sorry ^.^)Look and feel and sound: The game is old. It looks old. But it is not ugly. There are lots of details in this game, you can see the love that was put into it. The sound effects are on point, the music is amazing and the voice acting is just plain terrific. Controls are ok, need a bit of getting used to. The camera controls are useful but also take some training to master. Captains Orders:If you look for something different that needs your intellect to be on duty this may be for you. If you like puzzling, riddles and analyzing in a game - this is definitely for you. And if you are a fan of the setting it is a definite recommendation. Verdict: Treasure!  I will finish this ghastly game on stream at some point. I love it!For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But in what other game can you launch four murderous ghosts at a child, who then pisses himself and blacks out in fear, only to be re-awakened by the same four ghosts which then proceed to drive the child insane from fear?  And that is really all I have to say about Ghost Master.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They said this game is like Sims in which you control the characters in a house but at the same time you are the Ghost Master who tasks your minion ghosts to scare the living crap out of your visitors based on their character/personalities.  I would say I expected more from this game but after playing it, I realize this game has bad graphics, bad level-transitioning and a painful gameplay.  It is nothing like Sims and probably not worth my time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, Up until you you notice just how awful the A.I is (Was bad even for 2003-2004) SPOLIER AHEAD: There's one part, The fourth mission I think, were you go to the cabin from the evil dead and help three students read from a book. This is fine on it's own, nothing exciting, but fine. However, for them to read it all three must be in the cellar. I managed to get two down there, from what I can only assume was a glitch in the programming, but the third one (a lady if it matters) would not, under any cirumstance, go down there. I sat there for almost two hours waiting for the dumb broad to walk down there but instead she looked at book then put it back, sat down in two different chairs, looked in the fridge, washed her hands then walked to the out-house and took a♥♥♥♥♥♥ got up, walked back to the fridge, walk back to the outhouse and took another♥♥♥♥♥♥ walked back in and sat down on a chair. This cycle went on for *TWO HOURS* I tried luring her over to the cellar, but as soon as the charm wore off she went and took a dump and went back to the same cycle as before. I eventually was forced into restarting the ""Mission"" because of the broken cycle, but choose not too. Suffice to say it's unlikely I'll ever play the game again. For what it's worth, it's well worth the 1.24, because what parts do work are pretty fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Both good and very weird game at the same time. Your goal is to scare different characters and try to recruit new monsters to your arsenal. The game and overall character simulation is clearly inspired from The Sims series. Sadly it does not work as well this time. The characters seem to move in random directions and it may become very annoying to try to get them go somewhere particular. The idea is quite cool though that you are this ""Ghost Master"" who can summon these different and spooky monsters. It is a good 6.5/10 game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not too bad for a relatively unknown game from 2003. The graphics are not bad for that time and are still not unpleasant. It can take a while though to build up everyone's fear meters enough to scare them out of a house so you will be looking at the same graphics for a while and they will make you miss your shiny new graphics because they are actually pretty dull. But your ghosts have pretty neat effects. All the people speak gibberish like in a Sims game to give it the illusion that they have unlimited speach properties hence the illusion of being more realistic. I would rather have real spoken english. It takes forever to scare people but it's not a bad game to play through once.Extra special story portion for upvoters: when I was younger I beat Street Fighter 2 on SNES on the hardest difficulty (7 stars) with Ryu without not even ever losing one match, but never even losing a single round.

												I know I'm bad at games, but there is NO WAY I did anything to make this not work. The game itself must just be broken. I can't even get through the first instruction on the tutorial level because the camera functions don't work AT ALL. I can't move the view anywhere other than where it puts me. Trying to move it by holding the right mouse button makes a lovely grinding sound effect happen which I don't care to investigate further, but NONE of the other suggested controls do a damned thing to change the view. I just wasted half an hour trying to get past the first command on the first level. Even *I* am not THAT bad at games. I'm disappointed, as this one looked like a lot of fun. :( I want my $1 and my 30 minutes back, but I doubt I'll get either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More of a puzzle game than a strategy game, you'll need to put your ghosts in just the right place to unlock new characters and progress to the next level. It's a lot more tricky than just scaring people and sometimes the right combination of positioning and powers is difficult to figure out. It's fun at times, though the options menu always forgets my resolution settings and reverts back to the default screen size, making it quite an ugly game.			",467,249,13,72,66,5,70

												The game was a bit of fun back then but didn't age well. The most unfuriating thing is the entire game design, that your choice of ghosts will break a mission before you have even attempted it, as many levels require certain ghosts to be beaten but the game doesn't make those necessary picks clear to the player. Due to this, many levels become very frustrating, as there is no personal approach and just the designer devised solution. What could have been an interesting sandbox experience becomes a frustrating trial and error.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very promising premise and concept unfortunately squandered in a terrible game. I want to like this, I really do, but I just can't. It's plain bad. There're just too many random factors, bad AI pathfinding, and convoluted ""puzzles"" which require ridiculous leaps of logic when they even require logic at all (many are just nonsensical non-sequiturs that seem to assume that the player is psychic or something). And even if you do figure out the ""puzzles"" sometimes the game will just refuse to let you solve it by flat out not having a person go into the room you need them in to solve the ""puzzle"".The first couple of stages are simple enough to be kind of fun, but as you get further in the game quickly turns into a horrendous, frustrating slog.Really a pity.

But, you did not told though, what puzzles you going to solve and what skills you are actually require. It is unobvious, that you made wrong pick, until 15-20 mins in mission, and at this point, you only option is to restart mission, losing all progress.Most of the time you lossing mission just before it starts - just waste of time without guide.Cannot recomend this game, even on sale :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay becomes repetitive very quickly. During play there are a number of ""puzzles"" where you must use an ability or open a path for NPCs that, at times, offer no hints or tips leaving the user to resort to haphazard clicking and ability use to figure things out. This game falls far short of other tycoon games from its era and even earlier - spend your money elsewhere.I should also note that at least three hours of my playing time was spent asleep at the keyboard.

It should be integrated in such a way that it's quick and painless, features are introduced as new mechanics are introduced, or there's none. Prolonged tutorials where one cannot even perform the action until the narrator is done reciting War and Peace is effective at discouraging interest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not one of the best games.However, it does require you to think a lot, which I love, You really need to know a little bit about the game before you start playing otherwise you won't get all of the items/*spoiler* people you are looking for.

												DO NOT BUY! Even at less than a dollar, it's not worth it. It won't run on Windows 7, just goes to a blank white screen, then crashes. I don't know if this is a problem with Steam or Ghost Master. Other old programs that I bought at the same time work just fine. Supposedly, there's a way to fix it so it runs, but nothing's worked yet. Not worth downloading another program to get this one to work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can not recomend this game as I have not been able to play it. I have contacted Steam nearly a week ago and I have yet to receive a response. I am not the only person who has this problem. Many people have stated they have the same problem, again Steam have neither contacted them or offered any suggestions/solutions. I feel Steam is completly Irresponsible to sell a game that does not work or not contacting a long term customer. Just dont buy this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not a RTS. It may look like one, a game where you marshall your ghostly forces to scare away silly mortals, but after several levels, that drops away, and you are left with very specific goals, like get a person  to read a book in the basement.   It's like herding cats.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Ghost Master - Let's play & first impressions 

			Views: 23		

			This is my first impressions of Ghost Master by Sick Puppies and published by Strategy First. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam.		

I played Ghost Master for only 20 minutes or so (not necessarily because I think the game is that bad lol) until I completed the first stage.You use a selection of ghosts and monsters under your control to scare all the inhabitants of each level away.The game looks okay. The cinematics were low-res. I wasn’t really impressed by it but it is from 2003. I didn’t realise it was so old until after I played the game. Looks a lot like the Sims.The gameplay is not too bad. I got the hang of it with a bit of fiddling around (after skipping the tutorial). Doesn’t really seem to be a way to lose from what I saw (but I only played the first level). The mortals sound like they are speaking german or something. The most impressive thing about the game was the way you input your name. There is a transition from a cutscene to an interactive circular ouija board; you spell your desired name out on the board.On steam the full price is $5 and I’m not sure that it would be worth it. I find it hard to be optimistic that i would enjoy playing it much more. At the moment it is 85% percent off and only $0.74 which is a really low price for any game.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great idea made a little joyless but clunky controls.

												This game is about spooking mortals using ghosts.  The tutorial utilizes some person who sounds like your on hold when calling a company saying press one for this action.  The game seems simple but is over complicated using plasm bands whatever those are, bios for people to scare them and a seemingly nonsensical interface.  A dated game with a learning curve, so not the best choice for some fun.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $0.99			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This remains an underrated classic. A fresh take on puzzlers, it keeps a high replay value by introducing new ghosts and abilities all the way through. Unimpressed with the way you dealt with the last location? Go back and try again against the clock, or try to unlock a ghost you missed last time. It's at its most satisfying when you've learnt to up with a combination of abilities just at the right time, sending those poor mortals screaming into the night. There are also plenty of nods to horror and sci-fi films, can you spot them all? If only it had sold well first time round, I could be playing GM2 or 3 by now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is hilarious. Waaay back when it first came out, I wanted it, but never picked it up. Then I got it on a Steam Sale for like $2 or something and enjoyed it quite a bit. Very funny with lots of references to spooky movies like Ghostbusters, Evil Dead, etc. Even in 2014 the game holds up pretty well. It ran fine on windows 7 on a modern computer, although there might have been a few hiccups with some cut scenes or something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. It's that simple.Your objective is to usually spook humans out of a house, which you do using the ghosts at your disposal. Different ghosts are 'bound' to different point of focus, the ""fetters"". So taking several ghosts tagged Corpse into the fraternity level is unadvisable, because they won't have anywhere to be bound to the material world.There's a good amount of custom choices, with increased unlockable powers for all the ghosts based on how much ectoplasm (scary juice!) you earn. The levels always give a recommended lineup, but if you know what you're doing you can pick your own ghosts - to great success, or miserable failure: knowing the level helps!Their powers can be combined in sometimes unpredictable power combos. As in, this is not mentioned anywhere in the game! But in a sense it rewards experimenting. The music really brings out the goofy, let's-scare-the-pants-off-some-mortals atmosphere. The pickup in tempo once you REALLY get your ghosts going, combined with the screams of the terrified victims, is just hugely entertaining.Some of the levels with extra objectives require creative thinking, and some can be downright ""how the ♥♥♥♥ do I do this"" moments.  Nonetheless, the game is absolutely worth its low price tag, is very entertaining, and has good replayability if you liked it the first time around. I loved this game when I was younger and I still love it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, not many people will have heard of this one. It's an older title, and tended to slip through the cracks in its day - its original release was in 2003, which puts it just too early to catch on to the zeppelin of success casual games have built for themselves. It's a light puzzle/strategy game with a lot of potential for screwing around - the whole point is to drive the poor mortals away in a state of madness and terror, and it gives you a lot of neat toys with which to do so. I fondly recall a scenario where the most effective way to terrorize the population was to haunt the crap out of a pair of adjacent bathrooms. People would need to pee, trap themselves in one, get scared and run to the other, which would deliver a well-timed follow-up shock. Toilets rattled with supernatural rain and hail. Steam is limiting my ability to type like a maniac, so let me just say that, while it may not hold up against Skyrim, it's well worth a look and will give you some wonderful schadenfreud			",107,89,0,81,25,3,33

												As a total geek for modern day paranormal and supernatural stuff this one is fun. I saw it on the shelf years ago but didn't buy it at the time (because its from 2002 and I was a dirt poor high school student back then) but I'm glad I rediscovered it.You are a ghost master and your goal is to scare the living bejeesus out of all the humans inside a building. To do this you team up with spectres and have them possess various fetters that tie into what they are and what they can do. Some ghosts are simple enough (you have to bind them inside the house itself) while other, more powerful ones require specific fetters (a murderous ghost can only be bound to objects related to violence and murder, like hunting trophies). Once bound you can have them do small things like make noises, turn objects on and off, or just give off an aura of fear. As the humans become more frightened their fear will feed your powers and allow the ghosts in your command to do more. From making walls bleed to causing objects to fly around the room to even manifesting in all their horriffic glory!Get your ghouls and get those humans to♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves with terror before fleeing into the night. Quite a bit of fun, especially when you see some of them go insane with fear!			",223,78,1,67,20,2,24

												This remains an underrated classic. A fresh take on puzzlers, it keeps a high replay value by introducing new ghosts and abilities all the way through. Unimpressed with the way you dealt with the last location? Go back and try again against the clock, or try to unlock a ghost you missed last time. It's at its most satisfying when you've learnt to up with a combination of abilities just at the right time, sending those poor mortals screaming into the night. There are also plenty of nods to horror and sci-fi films, can you spot them all? If only it had sold well first time round, I could be playing GM2 or 3 by now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is simply one of the best games of all time.    Gameplay is fun and unique.  Nonviolent, but edgy and mischevious.  There is an overarching strategic layer that rewards multiple playthroughs of the campaign.  I've played it probably 7 or 8 times through (mostly in pre-steam incarnations).  It was too unique to find an audience when it came out, so the promised sequel was not made, and continues to be one of the great 'what if...' products of gaming.  This game invented a new genre, and its the only game of it's kind.  It's a must have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an old favorite of mine. Ghost Master is a game which is quite one of a kind. You play as a 'Ghost Master' who is the leader of a gang of ghosts who's task it is to scare the people of Gravenville. Each level is a parody of a well known horror movie. For example, there's a level called Poultrygeist. The level is set in a house which was built where a slaughterhouse for turkeys once stood. The goal is to free a poltergeist, who looks like a ball of light with feathers foating around it. Other settings range from sorority houses to hospitals to a military base.Each level has its own goal. Most of the time, that goal is to scare all humans untill they flee the location, or to drive them insane. In more complex levels, you need to manipulate the humans into doing certain tasks for you. Some humans (priests, wiccans,...) will fight back and try to banish your ghosts. You will find trapped ghosts in each level, who are stuck to an object. If you manage to free the ghost by doing a certain task/solving a certain puzzle, they will join your team. Each ghost has its own skills, and you can teach it new abilities following a skill tree. You can revisit each level and try a new team of ghosts and see if you can get a higher score with them. This adds a lot of replayability.The best part of this game is in my opinion the sound design. When starting a level, all you hear is some sort of astral choir, singing in the distance. As your ghosts start interfering with the world, the music reacts to their actions. This builds up untill all hell breaks loose, and then, well, you should hear it for yourself. The music is awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, after playing through act 1 and currently on act 2, i will say this,Ever got so annoyed by the sims? you know the ones you keep killing just for laughs?Well, if you ever wanted to scare them silly, than this game is for you.Ghost Master is one of those games which can be really fun, along with what i heard as 47 playable ghosts, to the missions you get and pretty much gameplay which can be really hilarious at times, Ghost Master can be really awesome...If not for a few flaws, Like. Bugs. Oh dear god. i think i had to restart one mission because of a bug that wouldn't let the people find a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book even though it's on the floor AND right in front of them, the AI can be a bit silly/bad at times and the graphics are kinda dated today.BUT. However, i would actually reccommend this game, why? Because it's literally one of those games where you can sit back and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off on how cheesy/B-Movie it is. from stereotypes to scaring the entire police force (Seriously, thats a mission.). Sure i ran into a few bugs here and there but that didn't stop me, all you do is restart the mission, simple as. Missions go like this, ""Do this and that."" BUT the mission you will come across most of the time is, ""Scare everybody.""Scare OR you can drive them to Insanity. This tells me you can have alot of fun replaying the missions with the new ghosts you have acquired or try and make them all insane. Which i will admit, was hard at first.All in all, i would say this game is an 8/10, good game but a few flaws.tl;dr-PROS-Replayable Missions.Cheesy/Narmy.Variety in Ghosts you can use.-CONS-Bugs.Cheesy/Narmy. (Why is this on here on both? depends on the person.)Dated Graphics(which, if you can look past, is a minor nitpick at best.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games ever. It's not flawless but offers a great amount of entertainment for many hours to play. Almost all levels can be completed with a variety of different methods, and new ghosts to be unlocked in every level. You can replay the levels you have already completed, to unlock stuff that you may have previously left behind. Level designs have a lot of variety and many possibilities to complete them. It's quite laid back game with no sweating or heavy fustration. but double the fun. Not a new piece but still as great as back in the days it was released. Only real cons I've discovered worth mentioning is the unknown elements in the levels. Sometimes there is unlockables in places that you don't even notice, and methods progressing that you couldn't even think of for they are somewhat random.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Scare them Away!This is one of my alltime favorites, even though the game is old and shows it's age it also is still a game I love(d) to play.You are a ghostmaster, an ""evil"" entity bend on building up psychic energy and scaring away the puny mortals out of ""your"" town. Be them students from a frat, some houseowners of a haunted mansion, cops, doctors or even ""tough as nails""-organized crime lords. The game is best described as Real Time Strategy, with resource and unit management, all of it quite deep and nicely made. It actually is fun to make people loose their mind, making them faint, or causing them not to use the loo anymore, using their surface and hidden fears is additional fun in creating the big scare out, all the while more and more PK will build up and you get closer to your true goal.Pros:A fast and easy to learn RTS-Game.A lot of ""entities"" that can be activated during the game.A variety of powers which might have different effects to different people.Nice scenarios, too bad the second part never made it.Cons:The game is easy, at least the first scenarios are self running if you know what to do.Compared to modern games, this might be a bit to short.RecommendedThe game has earned an unconditional recommendation - it had the potential to be the foundation of a lot of very interesting games in which you would have to manage the ghosts in some squad like group. Sadly, this game kept a sole exception. A lot of programmers tried to capture the spirit of the game but, well they didn't reach the quality or the spirit of this little and old game.Would there be a real continuation of this genre master, I would buy it instantly - no question asked, and no rebate required. It's a classic, and now also an underdog.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very original game idea and an execution that still holds up over a decade later. This game is by no means ""great"" in all respects, but it is good enough to be enjoyed, and some parts really do stand out. There are a lot of different classes of ghosts and a lot of powers with different animations, sounds, humans' reactions. Each level has a decent story behind it, and the ghosts and narrator dialoges are nicely written and voiced in a tongue-in-cheek style. It's a cute original game with much much more value than you'll typically get from $5 titles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah Ghost Master.. I use to play this so much back in 2003. it was lots of fun with many cool ghosts to haunt your Victims with and a good variety of mapsif you are a fan of strategy games and like old school games this is so worth it.the main Plot line of the game is that you as a Ghost master need to collect and free the traped ghosts around the area once you get the Ghost on the mission free its free for all. you just need to scare the left over people in the area or make them go mental and get as high haunting score as you can. i really would recommend this game if you are in for a haunting spree			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ghost MasterThis little thing is strangely enjoyable.You and your team of ghosts, ghouls, cats, talking brains, eyeballs - you name it - embark on missions, or ""hauntings"" to solve murder cases, rescue trapped ghosts to add to your alliance, and to, most importantly, scare the pants off some really pixelated human a$$holes. This is your turf, show 'em how it's done!7.5/10 Would electrocute a kitten again.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Each mission has ""Lost Spirits"" who can be recruited after completing some kind of mission or puzzle for them, which can be a little cryptic or the task can rely on the random pathing of AI (I hate you Bridget).

												I absolutely love this game. Sure, I wish it weren't so cartoon built sometimes but something about the style and storytelling captivates me. Bought it on sale a while back and was determined to get every penny out of it, but it quickly grew on me. Something about mobsters flashing into existence to lean on mortals and a flea-bitten dog who wouldn't pass on because he wanted to be with his friend makes this all come together very well.

												Sigh, I believe I bought this game on a whim. The premise of Ghost Master is to scare people in cartoonish fashion. It is a game and that is about all I can say. Not a terrible game just not a memorable one either. Ghost Master has its entertaining moments and trying to figure out how to release certain “special” ghosts from being chained to a location can be fun (there are special ghosts you can release during missions). It is also nice that you can increase the abilities of certain ghosts to make them more effective. I can recommend this game as a guilty pleasure, but only just as that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a total geek for modern day paranormal and supernatural stuff this one is fun. I saw it on the shelf years ago but didn't buy it at the time (because its from 2002 and I was a dirt poor high school student back then) but I'm glad I rediscovered it.You are a ghost master and your goal is to scare the living bejeesus out of all the humans inside a building. To do this you team up with spectres and have them possess various fetters that tie into what they are and what they can do. Some ghosts are simple enough (you have to bind them inside the house itself) while other, more powerful ones require specific fetters (a murderous ghost can only be bound to objects related to violence and murder, like hunting trophies). Once bound you can have them do small things like make noises, turn objects on and off, or just give off an aura of fear. As the humans become more frightened their fear will feed your powers and allow the ghosts in your command to do more. From making walls bleed to causing objects to fly around the room to even manifesting in all their horriffic glory!Get your ghouls and get those humans to♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves with terror before fleeing into the night. Quite a bit of fun, especially when you see some of them go insane with fear!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, not many people will have heard of this one. It's an older title, and tended to slip through the cracks in its day - its original release was in 2003, which puts it just too early to catch on to the zeppelin of success casual games have built for themselves. It's a light puzzle/strategy game with a lot of potential for screwing around - the whole point is to drive the poor mortals away in a state of madness and terror, and it gives you a lot of neat toys with which to do so. I fondly recall a scenario where the most effective way to terrorize the population was to haunt the crap out of a pair of adjacent bathrooms. People would need to pee, trap themselves in one, get scared and run to the other, which would deliver a well-timed follow-up shock. Toilets rattled with supernatural rain and hail. Steam is limiting my ability to type like a maniac, so let me just say that, while it may not hold up against Skyrim, it's well worth a look and will give you some wonderful schadenfreud			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Back when it was originally released I spent what felt like hours with this game. Although the graphics are somewhat dated now the game is still great fun and very original. If you like ghostbbusters and series like most haunted then you will love this game as you get the chance to play the 'other side' and create hillarious havoc across some fun and varied scenarios. You would be nuts not to try it out, especially as its less than a pound during todays sale.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ghost Master definitely stands out as one of the most unique games of its kind. The gameplay requires you to take control of your very own ghouls and each stage provides different objectives that you must carry out in order to finish the level. The difficulty (and maybe the only drawback of the game) lies within freeing certain ghosts. Sometimes you'll find yourself lucky at it, sometimes you won't. With its very low price tag, Ghost Master is definitely worth a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am glad to see that my old favourite, Ghost Master has made it onto Steam.Now, the best way to describe this game is ""The Sims: Inverted"". Instead of  having a bunch of Sims, you have to keep happy and well off, you have a cadre of Ghosts that only exist to keep your puny humans in a state of fear and madness.Now, this game is far from perfect: Many Ghost skills lack a precise description, that explain their exact workings, some levels are overly puzzly and if you don't install a trainer, you can't revisit previous levels with unlocked ghosts. Many reviews also complain about the fact that humans are eradic and difficult to herd. Personally, I think that this is a rather realistic depiction of people, under the influence of ghosts.Now, with all those factors: Is the game still fun?Yes! A lot! It is all about set up and delivery. Calling a bunch of humans into the same room and then springing your best frightener on them is incredibly statisfying. Seeing them run around, driven insane by your phantasm is really funny and using different kinds of frighteners in different situations is really great. There are a ton of small touches, like the descriptions of the humans, that are both funny and may inform you off their unique weaknesses or the desperate and endearing yells of your ghosts, if they ghet exorcised or captured.If you are a person who enjoys to manipulate and overlook, but ""The Sims"" is just not malevolent enough for you, go and give this gem a try!

												This is one of those games that truly has a unique experience awaiting the player. This is basically the Sims turned on it's head where instead of building up a virtual family or a house, your building up an ability to scare the pants off of the local Sims population. Complete with a multitude of nods to various movies and fictions, this game is packed with a tool set for the player to create his or her own brand of mayhem, and an almost unparalleled ability to cause spontaneous bursts of maniacal laughter. There really is something brilliant about having engineered circumstances just right so that a house full of Sims having a party is turned into complete chaos with all the party guests running and screaming around the map. There are some downsides. For instance, I still find the initial scenario and learning curve a bit clunky, and the interface is a bit micro management-ish, until you get used to it and get comfortable with the alternatives and shortcuts. There are also some minor bugs and occasionally you may find it difficult to advance a scenario as there is often no clear indication of what to do. (This is actually something I greatly appreciate as it is left to the player to figure out what he or she would like to do, but could be something others dislike).Overall, this is a genuinely magnificent game, full of character, humor, and a robust set of play mechanics. Right now there is an absurd sale for this title, and there has never been a better reason to give it a go. One of my all time favorites, I highly and wholeheartedly recommend this game.

												This game, where do I even begin? Okay, you ever watch Ghostbusters? Well this game is nothing like the movie. This game focuses on intricate mechanics and different alterations to various gameplays per round. You play as a Creator, or most likely a God of Ghosts. The objective is to scare the NPCs throughout several courses of mind-boggling terrain. In no other place will you find such great gameplay as you will find in Ghost Master®. Do not wait for this item to be removed from steam. This game is a must get for any player that owns a game on steam. You will not regret this purchase. 10/10 would buy again for the first time so that I could experience it's amazing graphics and controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sigh, I believe I bought this game on a whim. The premise of Ghost Master is to scare people in cartoonish fashion. It is a game and that is about all I can say. Not a terrible game just not a memorable one either. Ghost Master has its entertaining moments and trying to figure out how to release certain “special” ghosts from being chained to a location can be fun (there are special ghosts you can release during missions). It is also nice that you can increase the abilities of certain ghosts to make them more effective. I can recommend this game as a guilty pleasure, but only just as that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a puzzle game of the player putting ghosts up against the Sims is quite fun & would enjoy a sequel to this. Plenty of replayability with going back to previous haunts & sending in different ghosts to try to beat your time or drive more people insane or unlock trapped ghosts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FULL DISCLOSURE: I played this during my childhood when it was first released and therefore this game is very nostalgic for me . Disclosure over: I have never played and will likely never play another game like Ghost Master. It takes a very unique concept and runs as far as it could have been taken given the games budget. You play through several maps either scaring everyone away or completing objectives (or both). The act of terrorizing away mortals from their homes is suprisingly enjoyable, and the objectives vary the gameplay nicely. Unfortuantly, the game is short, but each level has immense replay value through trying to unlock new ghosts and attempting to reach a triple pumpkin time. There are also bugs and glitches, but they are rarely game breaking and are not enough to make this game not worth five dollars. Also, this game is constantly discounted to 74 cents, a bargain price for a game of this quality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ghost Master definitely stands out as one of the most unique games of its kind. The gameplay requires you to take control of your very own ghouls and each stage provides different objectives that you must carry out in order to finish the level. The difficulty (and maybe the only drawback of the game) lies within freeing certain ghosts. Sometimes you'll find yourself lucky at it, sometimes you won't. With its very low price tag, Ghost Master is definitely worth a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This remains an underrated classic. A fresh take on puzzlers, it keeps a high replay value by introducing new ghosts and abilities all the way through. Unimpressed with the way you dealt with the last location? Go back and try again against the clock, or try to unlock a ghost you missed last time. It's at its most satisfying when you've learnt to up with a combination of abilities just at the right time, sending those poor mortals screaming into the night. There are also plenty of nods to horror and sci-fi films, can you spot them all? If only it had sold well first time round, I could be playing GM2 or 3 by now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this from steam after losing my original disc as I had not completed the game. Its a classic imo which is why it has joined my collection. Back when it was originally released I spent what felt like hours with this game. Although the graphics are somewhat dated now the game is still great fun and very original. If you like ghostbbusters and series like most haunted then you will love this game as you get the chance to play the 'other side' and create hillarious havoc across some fun and varied scenarios. You would be nuts not to try it out, especially as its less than a pound during todays sale.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am glad to see that my old favourite, Ghost Master has made it onto Steam.Now, the best way to describe this game is ""The Sims: Inverted"". Instead of  having a bunch of Sims, you have to keep happy and well off, you have a cadre of Ghosts that only exist to keep your puny humans in a state of fear and madness.Now, this game is far from perfect: Many Ghost skills lack a precise description, that explain their exact workings, some levels are overly puzzly and if you don't install a trainer, you can't revisit previous levels with unlocked ghosts. Many reviews also complain about the fact that humans are eradic and difficult to herd. Personally, I think that this is a rather realistic depiction of people, under the influence of ghosts.Now, with all those factors: Is the game still fun?Yes! A lot! It is all about set up and delivery. Calling a bunch of humans into the same room and then springing your best frightener on them is incredibly statisfying. Seeing them run around, driven insane by your phantasm is really funny and using different kinds of frighteners in different situations is really great. There are a ton of small touches, like the descriptions of the humans, that are both funny and may inform you off their unique weaknesses or the desperate and endearing yells of your ghosts, if they ghet exorcised or captured.If you are a person who enjoys to manipulate and overlook, but ""The Sims"" is just not malevolent enough for you, go and give this gem a try!

												This game, where do I even begin? Okay, you ever watch Ghostbusters? Well this game is nothing like the movie. This game focuses on intricate mechanics and different alterations to various gameplays per round. You play as a Creator, or most likely a God of Ghosts. The objective is to scare the NPCs throughout several courses of mind-boggling terrain. In no other place will you find such great gameplay as you will find in Ghost Master®. Do not wait for this item to be removed from steam. This game is a must get for any player that owns a game on steam. You will not regret this purchase. 10/10 would buy again for the first time so that I could experience it's amazing graphics and controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before the was The Cabin in the Woods, there was Ghost Master.  This means that this game plays a lot like the sims, but in reverse.   Your job is to drive all of the sims insane with terror by unleashing your army of horrors on them.  There is a shockingly deep strategy game under the hood as well.  This is an old classic that is well worth the bargain price so don't miss it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is old, but it has aged reasonably well. If you liked Dungeon Keeper, and you probably did, you'll like this. The ghosts are nicely designed, the little injokes are amusing, and some of the puzzle parts make you think without making you annoyed.It's got its flaws, what game hasn't, but for the price it's very enjoyable and well worth getting.

Very funny with lots of references to spooky movies like Ghostbusters, Evil Dead, etc. Even in 2014 the game holds up pretty well. It ran fine on windows 7 on a modern computer, although there might have been a few hiccups with some cut scenes or something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
