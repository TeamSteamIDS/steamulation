												It is almost impossible to get a game online but that is exactly what it's like with the board game. You buy the game, set up the board and can't find anyone who wants to play it so in that respect they have nailed it. it is a perfect recreation of what it's like to own the board game. 5 Stars.

												I bought the game during the wintersale of 2015.I used to have the old 2008 Risk which I played for many hours.Now I picked this one up and I must say I am very stisfied with the product.You get 2 types of gameplay:there is the classic Risk which has mostly the same rules as the old one has except for some animations that have been added to the bottom while in battle.And then you have got the campaign mode which has 5 chapters and are all preceded by a very cute animated cartoon, about a war which keeps escalating between generals, cats, AI and others Which made me smile each time.I do believe they were sitting on a little goldmine there and could have added a longer campaign.You can also start a custom game which unlocks more maps after each campaign chapter you have beaten.The only problem that I have encountered is that sometimes while playing normal risk, the game refuses to invade a certain terratory and you must invade with a different region first before it responds. ( Maybe a fix if the developers read this)Overall definitily a must have if you are a Risk fan.You won't be disappointed. ",193,89,2,21,10,2,18

												Like strategy games, but don't want to deal with all the complex mechanisms present in 4X games or battle non-stop ""Zerg rushes"" in RTS?  If so, you might actually like this game.  It's basically the classic game RISK, but the ""Factions"" version involves playing one of five different groups: humans, robots, cats, yetis and the undead.  The only differences are visual (i.e. no faction-based special attacks or anything), but it adds a lively -- and often quite amusing -- flourish to what some consider a boring game.  The classic version is available, as well.The single player campaign is rather short, although the AI is cheap.  You can beat it eventually, but doing so relies more on luck than anything else.  Multiplayer is online or hot-seat.  All in all, it's an inexpensive strategy game that's easy to learn and visually more entertaining and accessible for those not normally inclined toward this genre.

												Before I found Steam I had watched some of my favorite youtubers play this game. I had dreamed of playing this amazing game, and a few months ago, I finally got to. Once I started the game I played the campaign so I could unlock the different character clans. They were good practice and really helped you get the feel of the game, the small story with short stories really brought it all together. I then proceded to play different game modes with my family and friends through hotseat and online multiplayer. Every game was a fun one, and it can sometimes prove to be a good challenge when you battle the AI. There is a glitch that makes it so that you are unable to click on the territory you want to attack, but you are able to hit enter which resolves the problem instantly. The AI also sometimes decide to only attack you, which can be frustrating at times and cause for a rage quit or game exit. Lack of any customization or physical dice rolling (via mouse shake) makes it slightly less enjoyable, but with everything else it has including different maps with different objectives, 5 different clans, the different game modes and the countless hours of enjoyability has me give this game a 9/10.

												Risk Factions is a small change to the Original Classic. It has too different modes: Risk & Risk Factions. Risk: Is the original game with no fancy art basic but still true to its routs. Risk Factions: Is a more dumbed down version which is alot more simple and adds a few additional features to the game. Such as objectives and stars from cards which add up to give you  a troop bonus. This game is good to play with friends it makes it alot more interesting but does also destroy a few friendships for a couple of days which I found out. With friends this is perfect. With tactics and ruthlesness. If you betray your friend to win you have a few things going on .You either win or keep your friends. This game is a mix of Luck and Skill so be sure to use your brain when playing this game. From a solo point of view the multiplayer is not great and you very rarely will find a lobby let alone people who will play with you. There is a campaign but this annoyed me as the first level is a tutorial and talks you through alot even tho I knew how to play so I gave up. But if you are new to risk I would encourage you to play this first. This game is really worth it and should be a good addition to your steam library. This is a must with friends and is a whole lot of fun. Whenever this is on sale try to encourage your friends to buy it. The more the merryier(up to 5 players). This game mixes RISK(pardon the pun) and reward. Really worth it! ",146,27,7,14,19,2,19

Overall, it's decent...Pros:- It's soo much fun (and salty ;) with friends)- You can play multiple times with mates before getting bored.- Has a lot of potential to expand.Cons:- Not realllyyy a single player game (for me that is)- Needs more world maps, like a Europe map, or USA States map. More world maps...- Needs to allow more than 5 players to play... like. come on.			",31,2,0,1,8,2,7

												4/5 feral cats.One of the few titles EA published right. This game is an electronic version of the popular board game called RISK. You control armies across a board which features a vast amount of territories to control and capture. Choose to command one of the belligerents of the game such as the Feral cats, mighty British army, filthy undead, and Bill Gates robots. Not one of these has advantages over the other which allows a fair game. Though, if you really want to be unfair and have the upper hand, certain territories feature special add-ons for your territory allowing bonuses to come into effect.These bonuses can range from placing airfields, artillery pieces, and an assortment of other bonuses which provide extra damage during the engagement process.Mass huge armies by placing counters on territories and send them to wipe out everyone across the globe, capturing more territory as you go, allowing more income counters for troops. This game is extremely fun played with others and you will have a blast. The back-story for the four races in the game is rather humorous and well made. You won’t regret this purchase.

I was also able to play it with gamepad, which was a little bit tricky at the beginning but when you find out which button is which and how to handle the user interface it's easy to play. There are two modes available, Fractions and classic risk, you can also turn off detailed war scenes and play it like classic risk with only dice roll. I didnt go further and try other features, I liked it so far.			",73,17,2,2,8,0,5

												I personally enjoy this game on a scale of 7.5/10 . I say this because I played the board game; and what is RISK Factions but RISK with animations, automated setups (Rather helpful), and if you have a laptop you can carry this as well as other games around. But why did I take off the other 3.5? Well one pro about it being electronic is the AI, but after a while the AI becomes predictable (Such as going  back for their capital at all costs), but the one major con I have with this game that is unless you're playing hotseat (but if you have actual RISK you can play it, just there is no animations, however either way there is problems with both, such as the board getting shook or water spilling) or a have a few willing friends is that multiplayer is basically a useless feature. The one way I've seen Multiplayer used to it's capibilaty is over state lines or even overseas. Well all in all, either way the way this game could grow in a major way is either fixing some of its bugs,  or extending the campaign and give it more of a story, or somehow by improving Multiplayer.Well I still like the game. Well, if you like RISK, try the game, if not then either way you should give it a shot, Steam gives refunds ya know.Well again. I still like the game besides all its flaws and  I still reccomend giving it a shot.			",31,6,0,5,4,0,2

												This game sucks.  I had another review and played it a bit more and changed my mind.  The RNG is horrable.  It is crazy streaky to rediculousness.  I mean how many times in a row will 2 die come up with the same number?  Try 9 times.  While that is the most I have happen, streaks for like 4 or 5 are not uncommon.To make matters worse, is that it has a die rolling animation that is super slow.  You need to watch this with EACH DIE ROLL.  Huge stacks take forever.  There was some kind of quick thing, but it stopped doing that and I have no idea how to do faster rolls.  The UI is also kind of buggy, perhaps the dissapearance of the fast rolling is part of that.  The AI is pretty stupid as well.The extra game modes do not add anything, as thier special rules are quite ""broken"".  IE: There is the temple thing you can control that you can use once per turn that will not just kill an entire stack, but actually change the stack to your guys.  Someone just dropped a stack of 32 guys?  Thanks, Ill take those, they are mine now.  Of course the AI doesn't realise the god power here and just summons giant stacks for you to possess.  That is when it is not flooding its own stacks (another map feature) and killing its own men.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												The game is fun (it's Risk, not that hard to make fun) but the servers have some IMMENSE problems keeping a connection going. I was playing with my brother and twice in a row, once where he hosted, once where I hosted, we were forced to leave the game because it became unresponsive. Both times it happened mid command, leaving the one not hosting unable to do anything but exit.That aside, playing against the AI is like playing against someone with a loaded dice. A mathematically impossible move (him defending with 1 against your 15 and winning) seems to be something it excels at.The graphics are good and I think I'll take a deeper look into the campaign, but skirmishing agaist the AI can not be advised, and you risk losing a game due to it bugging out if you're playing online.Maybe EA will release a ""Be able to finish a match"" DLC for 19.99$ in the future, but I doubt it. EA keeping to their standards I suppose.			",58,2,1,14,2,0,1

												Things wrong with this game:1. Complete lack of control over game parameters. This game gives you zero options for adjusting any in-game settings. You can't even do an actual manual placement of troops. You can pick your color, but that is really it. 2. Clearly unbalance combat algorithms and computer AI that work co-operatively against the player. The computer regularly had rolls that favored it enormously while also generating highly improbable rolls to disadvantage the player. I don't mind a challenge, but at least have that challenge based in the strategy of the AIs rather than obvious cheating. 3. Poorly designed user interface. Risk is a pretty simple game but this iteration makes it overly complex with frustrating controls. Avoid this title.			",13,3,0,2,0,0,18

												I can't believe all the positive reviews for this.. am I missing something?The stupid slow dice animations etc drive me insane!  There is a slight fast forward option that you have to click for each opponent..   which is still a bit slow.. but there is no option to speed up your turn.  You have to watch drawn out crappy dice animations for every dice roll!I've played a lot of risk games on computers.. the best version ever was one on an old Apple (before OSX) that concentrated on the strategy not crappy graphics and slow animations.After you played risk a lot you don't want to watch dumb animations every turn.. you just want to action your move and do it instantly.Worse version I've ever played.. other versions on steam had worse reviews so I'd hate to see how bad they are.  I should've got the demo first.Slow, cumbersome and crappy.   It would take you 2 hours to play a 10 minute game if you could bear play it for that long.			",17,0,6,4,2,0,3

												Awesome game!  There's the classic Risk mode and the upgraded Risk Factions mode, which is actually extremely fun.  My one criticism is that the campaign is too short!  I finished it and was left wanting more.  I really hope there is an expansion made for this game, because it's good fun.			",95,19,0,46,8,5,44

TL;DRNeat for anyone who likes a simplified RISK to play with friends online, and doesn't want to wait an hour for decisions to be made. ProsGraphicsSimpleConsDrag and Click doesn't always select properlyRNG seems stupid at times Gameplay I've been meaning to learn RISK for a while. It was always one of those games that I saw and heard a lot about, but never quite got around to the stage of persuading people to sit around a table and play it. With RISK: Factions on steam, this problem is eliminated. If you have no clue whatsoever on how to play the game, this will give you a nice crash course, though the rules it offers with the Factions element are a lot more simplified than the normal rules. They also make the gameplay a lot faster. It can be fiddly working with the faster drag and release methods to speed up troop fights. You can either watch fights happen, including each painstaking dice roll, or just speed through them. Sometimes it doesn't always work when selecting and choosing – and with smaller territories they can be hard to highlight. I've had quite a few incidents where I wanted to invade a specific territory, and it took me 20 or so tries before the area finally got highlighted.The main campaign mode is designed basically to give you the rules on this version of the game, and introduce you to five “leaders” who each have their quirks. You also get the option to have the classic RISK map without the added faction goodies, a classic RISK map with them thrown in, and a faster win method, or utilising maps that showed throughout the campaign, with their specific objectives. You can control one of five leaders: McGutterpants, Generalissmo Meow, His Excellency, Gary, Commandant SixFour, or Colonal Stiffenberg, You can either take objectives on the map for extra bonuses within game, such as an enemy city or capital, or achieve something such as taking over 5 territories in one turn -- to gain advantages over the rest. I can guarantee RNG will annoy you a lot. It can be depressing to see your 10 troops fail to take over an country with only 2 troops defending. Such is the way of the RNG Gods.The graphics are cartoonish and comical in nature. The faction leaders are funny, with their own animations and expressions for when they attack, lose land, and gain land. The maps themselves are easy to follow, and quite bright. The music is alright, there's nothing I would find outstanding about it – same with the voice acting tailored to the faction leaders.There's nothing particularly special about this game, but if you want to play RISK, learn the rules, and be able to play with friends online, then this is definitely worth some of your hours.Want moar?

												Oh my, another RISK game. Well, dont get me wrong, its a good game overall. The multiplayer is dead, if you dont have anyone to play with then all you are going to do is finish the campaign and play 2-3 missions on Custom mode. Thats pretty much it, it doesn't have much going for it. The objectives are great and all, the animations are halirous and the cutscenes will give you a laugh or two, but the game doesn't have that original RISK feeling. If you are a fan of RISK and you have nothin' to do, sure, why not? I'd say you can finish the campaign in around 2-3 hours minimum, and the Custom mode is great. It will kill some hours and then you will probably never touch it again. Meh 3/5, would bang.			",128,13,1,11,13,1,25

												I am a huge risk fan.  I play both the fanction rules and classic rules on both the table top and the computer--I have for over 15 years.  The AI in this PC version is without a doubt the most confusing and selectively stupid I have ever played with.  It is easy to beat an AI, but difficult to beat 4, as they all will randomly gang up on you or make terrible plays that with screw their chance at victory in order to screw yours as well.  To sum it up, the AI has zero survival skills and makes the experience frustration at best.  You will win, but at the cost of the fun you were playing for.			",29,1,0,2,7,0,12

I bought the game with the mind set that I was probably going to refund it because of the reviews but I actually really enjoy it. Definitely worth 10$ to not have to deal with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ browser versions.They have the regular game of risk in it which I found nice and then their version, which is pretty fun tbh.My only complaint would be that there is no team play.

												I LOVED this game for xbox360... i played hundreds of hours on it with single player and multiplayer.... best risk game ive ever played, so when i saw this game i picked it up for my friend and myself.... so i got screwed twice. there are SOOO many problems with the pc version. Mouse movement seems a little delayed which is annoying, and makes deploying troops hard. the autoroll seems to disappear and reappear randomly so sometimes you can speed through it and other times u have to wait and watch each roll. the game constantly freezes up for a second or two at a time, the dice rolling is rigged and (look at other reviews to confirm this) . you cant invite someone to a game if you are in appear offline on steam. overall i give the XBOX 360 version 11/10 and the PC version gets a 1/10 and the only reason i even gave it a 1 over a 0 is because i played through a game and actually finished it. but i wont be playing again. If i could take the game back i would. AVOID THE PC VERSION OF THE GAME LIKE THE PLAGUE!			",28,4,1,9,0,0,4

												This is such a close toss up. I really love the original RISK game but this version just has one too many problems.It won't show you the die rolls, once ONE unit attacks a country you HAVE to keep attacking until one of the countries loses all of its men, there's no way to stop. No wearing the enemy down slowly. You have to go all in. But you don't actually know who's winning becausue you can't see the dice.The dice rolls themselves are probably hidden because they're not very realistic. 1 unit will defend of 25 units a turn, every turn, indefinitely.If you play with Computer Players it doesn't count up how many units they SHOULD receive at the beginning of the turn but instead just gives them insane numbers of units without explanation, ie. He has 1 country, 0 capitals, 0 cities, so he receives 35 units. Then he also turned in 2 stars so he receives another 35 units.Guy that literally has one country left was just given 70 units and wins the game in a single turn.This ONLY happens to the AI players. It actually counts out the units given to the human players, and it doesn't give them unfair help.All that being said multiplayer online is so buggy you can actually only play 1 out of every 5 games through. Most of the time it will stop working, ie. You can no longer click or move the mouse, someone's turn is permanently skipped, the game kicks a human player for no reason and replaces it with an AI mid-game without permission,But it is kinda fun the one out of ten times it works. Lots of different levels and you don't need to play with the silly cartoon characters if you don't like them, but personally I like them.			",27,5,0,7,9,1,5

												Concept sounds good, looks ok, runs like garbage. TLDR; NopeIn single player I had issues clicking on my troops due to some areas having awkward detection for the mouse.In multiplayer, 4/4 local games via hotseat crashed after hours into the games. It's not worth the frustration.It's not worth the unreal dice rolls.I can't even table flip this in rage :PSadly I can't recommend this game for 9.99$, or any price because it is basically broken. -Vanilla Tuna ",158,55,2,26,21,1,22

												First off I would like to say i'm a huge risk fan. I bought this game because it is a "" Strategy Game "" but as i've seen others post , this couldnt require less strategy and more brute force and luck if you hacked the game and rolled yourself sixes EACH TIME! I also was playing risk about 10 minutes ago and i had taken asia australia north and south america. Then Mc Gutterpants spawns 40 units FROM CARDS and takes over my territory of 30 units and they lost 10 units. I then spawned in 35 units to retake greenland so we are at 30 vs 35 good odds for me , or so i thought. When I attacked I lost ALL OF MY UNITS and they again lost 10! To some this up , my main problem is this requires no strategy and tons of cold war build up so PLEASE don't waste you money on this go buy a set in dota or a civ map pack!			",17,2,0,4,5,0,20

												Cartoon graphics. No card or roll options; no expanded maps in classic gameplay. The 2 speed settings are 1.Just slow enough to annoying. or 2. Uselessly fast blurs and flashes of movement and attacks. The 90's version of the hasbro risk game (ahem, before EA bought them) was better in graphics, asthetics, had many larger maps, options on how to use your dice for each other, options to turn off sluggish animations, options to use increasing or set card reenforcements... It was a better game in every way. AND it's 10 years older... Risk Factions is a waste of money.			",29,5,0,3,5,0,14

												The campaign is alright, but takes about 1.5 hours to complete. The computer's AI is really, really bad, and the RNG seems... a bit off (in my ""War Record"", it shows I've rolled a 1 about 450 times, and rolled a 6 about 200).  It feels bad to see 15 of your troops fail against an enemy with 2. It feels worse when that happens multiple times a game. If you have friends to play with online the board and assorted flash is really nice, the characters are charming. Otherwise, give it a pass. The single player is not worth the cost, even on sale.

												How hard is it to have the bare elements of risk properly shown in a digital format? We have this simple game, not too much more complicated to create then chess, yet we have to keep trying recreate the wheel. I should feel like I am playing risk, but I feel like I am playing completely different game which laughably trying to relate to the Angry Birds crowds. Risk should be about old timey armies with muskets, while riding on hoarse back, not unfunny cats, and uninspired, cheaply made cartoons under the guise of quirky style. This game felt like a joke, a $10 joke.			",47,4,0,6,6,2,4

												My opinions of the original Risk boardgame nonwithstanding, Risk: Factions is awfully ported from whatever platform it was initially released on. Graphical glitches galore, netcode so broken it can't even sustain a simple turn-based game without crashing and disconnecting. Aside from the fact that, as an improvement of Risk, it's fairly unimpressive, it's an absolute mess of a piece of software. If you're looking for a fun strategy game in the same vien, check out Small World 2. Like Risk: Factions, the port isn't great, but shines compared to this.			",367,68,10,25,15,0,22

												Why does this game suck? Well, the computer always has the advantage of attacking. there will be not one turn where you will sucessfully defend against an attack. Then, the computer tries to make itself good by avoiding the other computer ai, having you as the first priority to attack. There's no option to make you go first, so you always go last.

												This is by far the worst game I have ever played on Steam, with the possible exception of ""Magica"".  Why anyone would ever keep this game, even after having paid money for it, I can only attribute to the ""sunk cost fallacy.""  Hasbro or any other developers who had anything to do with this total piece of ratshit should no longer be gainfully employed.  What a waste of money, space and time.  I regret every single minute I spent playing this piece-of-chickenshit game and I wish there were some way for Steam, Hasbro or whoever else had a hand in developing the game to give me back the wasted hours of my life.

One of those games where the person winning is having a blast, but the losers just want to slit their wrists. Risk is just too simplistic and there's a reason most of us grow out of it in gradeschool. Go play Civ or one of the good european board games.			",292,119,1,83,41,1,84

												The idea is fantastic.  I like all the extra stuff, the various 'things' that you can capture to change the way the game plays.  The writing is humorous.  It's Risk plus a bit more.And then the problems.  The campaign was...an introduction to the various factions.  That's it.  You didn't get to pick sides.  You simply got to play as the new faction.  But what's different about each faction?  The animations and the color!  That's it.  It's RISK so I really don't ask for the factions to have different powers.  But the animations.  They're cute, they're funny, I think they're well done...until you've witnessed them for the 100th time.  You can make the dice go faster...by giving up the dice all together and committing fully to the attack.  Tired of the slow animations that were fun and cute for the first couple hours?  Well, you can speed up the animation where the computer takes over territories (that's the ONLY animation that speeds up when you hit fast forward).  Tired of that same message that says ""cities help your ability to draft new soldiers""?  Too bad.  The game will remind you EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A TERRITORY WITH A CITY, duh, you're obviously too dumb to've got it the first 50 times it told you.  ^_^So I got tired of the aniimations.  I'll play Classic RIsk!  I thought.  How could they screw that up?  That's been done before.  All the rules and the standard variat...oh, there are no variations... fine.  Aaaaaaaand then I get gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I understand.  I get it.  I don't win Risk all the time.  But when I lose, because one of the AIs turns in three sets of cards, three turns in a row, and then...I'm still alive...I have a set...it's the draft phase but I CAN'T TURN IN THE SET because the game lagged (single player) and I clicked on the card menu, which closed the card menu...but then I open it back up and can't turn it in?  ♥♥♥♥ you Risk Factions.  ♥♥♥♥ you.Oh, and the actual game controller controls are not properly reflected on the screen.  Really?  The developer can't even get the controls to be properly reflected on the screen?So to summarize:  This game is like that pretty guy or girl that you've just scored a date with.  They're fun, they're fantastic, they seem to be everything you want.  That little thing they do that annoys you, that's no big deal--until you discover that there are a lot of those ""little things that annoy you""  I do think it's almost worth the $10 I paid for it.  I certainly got two or three good hours of enjoyment out of it--but I can't recommend it.  It seems like a solid game until you get under the hood and check it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is so bad. Better said, this game has one of the worst rng factors I've ever stumbled across. Yeah I know, happens in real life risk too, but no one plays the game online anymore, so you'll only have the AI to play against. And this is where the ridiculous rng happens. Ever lost with 15 units against 1 pc unit rolling 10x 6 in a row? Yeah that's fun! Another example: I just lost a game because of only getting 1 card set done (right in the beginning for 6 units) the three AI enemies could each complete a card set every three turns two times in a row. It ended with me having 4 countries 3 units each against AI opponents each controlling a continent. But they didn't decide to weaken each other to deny their continent bonuses, but somehow they decided to crush themselves in North America. In the end I managed to conquer South America and then suddenly they decided to deny my bonuses.TL;DR: Everytime you get realistic chances at winning the game, all AI opponents will leap on you together. When done, they will continue doing their thing. + bad rng dice rollsIf some of you are interested in my rolls:1: 8542: 8493: 8274: 8035: 8266: 7691:6 deviation: +9%, 2:5 deviation: -10%, 3:4 deviation: -10,3%After this amount of rolls it should start to get to zero deviation, but no.

												The other day I had a craving for RISK, so naturally I decided to go into steam and check to see if there was some sort of RISK related game available. The most recent one I saw was RISK Factions. It seemed fun at first, but it slowly took a turn. I have played hundreds of games of risk, but none have frustrated me more than this game. The AI's never fight logically, they only fight s♥♥♥♥♥dically and randomly in a way that just feels unrealistic and unsatisfying. I don't know how they messed this part up, but the dice rolls are simply unbalanced. There were far too many rolls where I got five or six 1's in a row, even when I had 8 or so infantry attacking a 2 infantry territory. Although there is a ""classic"" option when creating a custom game, I would've preferred a more realistic or at least more mature version of RISK instead of the childish, silly, and laggy characters and animations they've included. There is another version of RISK on steam that does not include online multiplayer, but must be a much better game than this garbage. The game may have been worth it if it was like 75% off, but I got it for $5 and it was not worth it at all.			",10,7,0,2,3,0,3

												This game is so bad. Better said, this game has one of the worst rng factors I've ever stumbled across. Yeah I know, happens in real life risk too, but no one plays the game online anymore, so you'll only have the AI to play against. And this is where the ridiculous rng happens. Ever lost with 15 units against 1 pc unit rolling 10x 6 in a row? Yeah that's fun! Another example: I just lost a game because of only getting 1 card set done (right in the beginning for 6 units) the three AI enemies could each complete a card set every three turns two times in a row. It ended with me having 4 countries 3 units each against AI opponents each controlling a continent. But they didn't decide to weaken each other to deny their continent bonuses, but somehow they decided to crush themselves in North America. In the end I managed to conquer South America and then suddenly they decided to deny my bonuses.TL;DR: Everytime you get realistic chances at winning the game, all AI opponents will leap on you together. When done, they will continue doing their thing. + bad rng dice rollsIf some of you are interested in my rolls:1: 8542: 8493: 8274: 8035: 8266: 7691:6 deviation: +9%, 2:5 deviation: -10%, 3:4 deviation: -10,3%After this amount of rolls it should start to get to zero deviation, but no.

												I love this game. I played the Pogo free Risk online and it sucks. Too easy. The faction mode offers new challenges and more variety to the game. I think the game has a balance issue however. The cat faction seems to be more difficult to win against when attacking. Maybe its the whole Cats have Nine Lives thing. But it's there. This version is still easy. I think i've won maybe 36 out of 40 games. But mixing up the maps and game modes makes this worth a purchase for strategy lovers.			",58,4,0,5,1,1,6

												I love risk and I adore the graphical nature that this one includes. That said, I played a game with a friend on the hotseat multiplayer against an ai named Gary and we lost misserably. I don't want to sound like a poor looser(which I'm well aware that I do) but Gary attacked my territory with 30 troops on it with 4 and won without loosing a single troop. He then went on and attacked my friends territory of 34 and once again won without loosing a single troop. Now I realise that sometimes these things happen due to the ""luck of the dice"" but for it to happen twice in a row without loosing a single troop shows a bit dice favoritism. It's still a great game but I wouldn't nessesarly recomened it for battling against a cpu. Between human oponets the dice rolls are a lot fairer so that's who I'd recomened you play against.

												If you're a Risk junkie I'd say pick it up on sale but don't expect perfection.I enjoyed the game for a while at first as it's an interesting new way to play the game of Risk. There are unusual challenges and a lot of extra strategy thrown in but they could have done a lot better overall.The dice are the worst part of the game. You can have 50 guys attack a territory with 5 people in it and lose 20 of yours on a regular basis. I've lost 15 in a row attacking a 1 defender (no defense die) and the sad part is it happens at one point almost every game.There's also no customization options, playing a classic game of Risk only allows you to have the trade-in option of the cards increasing by 5s every trade, which means it's pointless to even go for country bonuses because once they get to 10+ troops per trade it's only about taking eachother's cards. The factions part of the game is more fun but with the cheating of the dice described above it causes a ton of rage quits.Wish they'd fix it or maybe even make a new version that's more polished and fair but I'm sure they won't. Not really recommended unless you really like Risk and find it for under $5.			",106,9,2,24,4,3,5

												Personally my problem with this game is that the A.I is completely biased and will always ALWAYS attack me instead of the other A.I regardless of how powerful the other A.I are around it. And then to top that off I can attack an enemy that is only 1 unit strong with an army that is 8+ and lose the battle and my entire reinforcements for that round, then the A.I will of course attack me and take all my remaining territories.Edit:Alright let me make it really clear. After a few games of risk I should NOT be able to see the A.I using the EXACT SAME TACTIC over and over again!!! It got to the point where I was able to accurately predict exactly where the enemy was going to invade every single time. Let me also make something else clear, cards should not give you 40 UNITS AND ALLOW YOU TO TAKE OVER ALL OF EUROPE, AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA IN ONE TURN WHILE SIMUTANEOUSLY DESTROYING ALL OF THE ENEMIES STOCKPILED UNITS			",60,11,0,17,33,1,29

												This game is so bad. Better said, this game has one of the worst rng factors I've ever stumbled across. Yeah I know, happens in real life risk too, but no one plays the game online anymore, so you'll only have the AI to play against. And this is where the ridiculous rng happens. Ever lost with 15 units against 1 pc unit rolling 10x 6 in a row? Yeah that's fun! Another example: I just lost a game because of only getting 1 card set done (right in the beginning for 6 units) the three AI enemies could each complete a card set every three turns two times in a row. It ended with me having 4 countries 3 units each against AI opponents each controlling a continent. But they didn't decide to weaken each other to deny their continent bonuses, but somehow they decided to crush themselves in North America. In the end I managed to conquer South America and then suddenly they decided to deny my bonuses.TL;DR: Everytime you get realistic chances at winning the game, all AI opponents will leap on you together.
