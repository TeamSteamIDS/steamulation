This review is written with Total War players in mind. As such, it will not adress basic gameplay that is inherent in all Total War games, such as turn based production and real time battling, but rather will compare Empire: Total War with other Total War titles.As a Total War fan, my personal preference goes to this title, Empire. I like most Total War games, but Empire stands out to me. For one, I enjoy the historic time period. For two, it plays the most 'different' from the other titles. Older titles, such as the first Rome: Total War game and Medieval II, heavily favour an agressive play style, with a lot of chaotic melees. Later games, such as Rome II and Shogun II, lean more towards a balanced stance between agression and response, depending on how superior your battlefield position and force is.Empire: Total War, in contrast, is a game of patience. Instead of charging into melee, the gameplay entails meticulously positioning lines of infantry and laying down volleys of fire. Mirorring the idea of the age, it is the 'gentleman's edition' of Total War. The Fall of the Samurai expansion to Shogun II comes closest to the Empire style of play, with rifle armed infantry and gatling guns, and keeps the option to go into melee samurai charge mode, but Empire remain the only edition (excluding Napoleon: Total War) to favour a line to line exchange of fire.Another difference is the naval battles. Granted, later editions in the Total War series incorporate these as well, but Romans or Edo era Japanese boats firing on one another with arrows pale next to the awesome power of a multiple deck ships of the line wailing away at one another. Again, Fall of Samurai introduces ironclad ships that approach this somewhat.Of course, later titles have more recent, better developed versions of some of the aspects of Empire, and there are some other downsides to Empire. As usual with a Total War title, Creative Assembly has a tendency to leaving things not as smooth as they could have been. Most bugs have been smoothed out after release, as they usually are, but some small problems remain here and there (such as batteries of cannon simply not firing unless directed to do so in a very specific way). Additionally, while the battles themselves offer some of the most unique Total War battle experiences, the map campaign improves little on previous editions. Not that this is necessary, because the region based resources and capture cities work well for the entire series. However, there is one significant improvement to me here, and that is that the map spans the most territory of any Total War game. Where Rome II limits itself to Europe and North Africa, and Shogun II is set in Japan, Empire scopes the entire Western dominated world of the Elizabethan age: Europe, North America, Africa and the Indies. The later release Napoleon: Total War does not nearly reach the score Empire does, and its campaigns are focused on smaller scale conquest rather than the world theatre of Empire.As for the research system, it seems that the Empire title marks the start of an overhaul, where the series starts mimicing the more traditional 'tech tree' idea that prevails in many strategy games. This is not a bad thing, but it is an addition that was perhaps not entirely necessary. All the more so because sometimes it seems like a shoehorn to introduce the game's traditional late game obstacle. Every Total War game has some sort of hindering mechanic that makes the game prgressively more difficult as time advances. In Empire, research (which you need to keep up with your modernizing rivals) introduces squalor, which makes for an unhappy populace, which makes you either have to sink money into keeping them happy or have to deal with rebellions.If you prefer a more agressive slugfest in a game, I would suggest Rome II, Shogun II, or if you don't mind some more antiquated aestethics and graphics, Medieval II.  If you like your games new and crisp, the more recent titles are sure to be your thing as well. If you want a more modern game that still uses line infantry and gun batteries, Shogun II's Fall of the Samurai expansion is your ticket.But if you want a true, professional standing army of line infantry that knows how to hold under fire as well as deliver it, if you want to be a gentleman general of standing, if you want an 18th century battlefield, then this, my friend, this is the game for you.

Maybe you wish to invade India and create an empire of tea and corruption?Maybe you just hate the French with such an unreasonable passion that you want to invade them for nothing?Or becuase they are French?Have you ever hated freedoms and liberties? Maybe you just want to crush the American Revolution and Tax the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them for high quality tea?Ever wanted to sink a Spanish Armada just becuase its too Catholic for its own good?Or maybe, just maybe you want to demonstrate the beauty of gunpowder to the savages of the Americas?Maybe you want to murder a people in order to force them to grow you opium?

												For me still one of the best TW games ... after the ""desease"" at release with a bunch of patches solved most problems of the game during the following months. This was a hard time for many hardcore TW fans and many were really annoyed with it or still are. This is understand able, because many of the bugs were silly at least, as well some of the patches made things worse but did not improve problems. So players become feeling to be the beta testing object for CA for a still bought, but very bugged game and this is not acceptable.Empire is now running very good, but in combination with Darth Mod which improves the game to a status, which normally should be delivered by Creative Assembly itself in my opinion. I don't know in detail how Darth and his modding team did improve, but the result is only great. For example, the AI was really improved - not that AI becomes a smart enemy in campaign, but the acting was put by Darth into good rails of logical issue. Some things were improved by simple overwriting, for example the masses of merchant ships build by AI insteed war ships with the simple solution to let recruit smaller war ships (up to 4th class) in merchant ports too.I played Napoleon very often too and some of the the improvements here are missing in Empire. Napoleon itself is very interesting too, but for me too local and too small as campaign map. To be honest, the following Shogun TW and RTW-2 brought further, very good improvements in game, but these games did not convince me to play further. RTW-2 has for me a very bad graphic and game hub design which did me more annoy as giving fun. In conclusion, Empire is still my favorite TW game and still makes fun after nearly 3,500 hours game time!			",8,0,0,1,12,0,9

												Started an Austrian campaign with the intentions of using their light infantry to skirmish my way to to an Austrian empire in western Europe.Despite my best intentions of leaving the mighty Ottoman empire alone I was eventually drawn into a war with them while my armies were busy in France. I got steamrolled pretty badly and it was clear that I couldn't hold out on two fronts.Taking inspiration from another famous Austrian I decided to Boys From Brazil the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. Fully half of my forces were left to turtle up around my strongest city, defending a bunker as it were, and hold out as long as possible before the inevitable. The rest were piled into what naval strength I had and sailed for the New World. Several turns later they arrived and took over a South American province just before my last one in mainland Europe fell (thus knocking me out of the game) and the rest of the South American provinces fell shortly afterwards. Eventually the Austrian Empire Reborn was able to conquer most of the Americas and return to Europe to dish out some extremely righteous vengeance.10/10, would proto-Hitler again.

												Personal Rating: A Library MainstayGenre: Third Person StrategyEmpire: Total War is a third person strategy game. When you start, you take control of country represented by a historic monarch during the year 1700 AD. Each turn represents a time of six months giving you winter and summer.  Each season will affect the production and movement of armies/agents. The world encompasses North America, Europe, East Europe/Russia, North Africa, India, and part of the Middle East.  You will have the options to engage in war, diplomacy and trade. Each and every city in the game is conquerable by the armies that you will recruit, train, and lead into battle. The game ends at the year of 1800 AD, by this time you will hopefully have conquered the world through military might backed by a sterling economy. Depending on the country that you will need to work with different types of governments ranging from a democracy to anarchy. Each has it advantages as well as negatives aspect. Your type of government will affect how other nations in the game will perceive you. Their diplomacy will be altered accordingly. As the years in the game progress the people in it will become older and eventually die. When this happens in a monarch, dictatorships etc. the rulers oldest child will become the next ruler. As you progress through the campaign, your nations will need to have its infrastructure upgraded to continue to compete on a worldwide level. Each building you have within your borders will contribute to your nation whether it is economically, scholarly or militarily. Each building has a construction tree that can be accessed through the in game encyclopedia.  Eventually you will need to research new technology to build the next level of building or troops. Eventually you come to a crossroads with a fellow nation. When this happens you will be forced to settle your differences in the field and oceans of the world. You have a wide verity of infantry, cavalry and artillery you can choose to build your navies and armies out of each group is divided into subcategories each with its own benefits. Empire is a game that I have enjoyed for a long time. I have ""I have rarely, if ever, experienced the same play through during the many sessions I have put into the game. I still fined the battles enjoyable and when I need a stretch I can play in the thriving MP hubs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire: Total War takes place during the 18th century; The age of absolute monarchies, imperial colonialism, the enlightenment, and the beginnings of globalism & industrialism. This particular TW has set its name apart from all the others in the series for a few specific reasons. Being the fifth title in the series and the first Total War game to solely focus on guns & artillery, it had big expectations. However, upon it's release it generally got mixed reception. Many people criticized it negatively, but I believe it to be one of the better Total War games.Pros:- Three separate theatres of warThe Americas, Europe, India, and four theatres of trade.- 11 Major Nations to choose from. (All factions playable with mods)- The Road to Independence CampaignSeparated into four parts, this game mode acts as a tutorial as a general campaign. You found the Jamestown/Virginia colony and expand, fight in the French-Indian Wars alongside Britiain as the 13 Colonies, rebel and fight the British at Bunker Hill, and finally form The United States.- Amazing Land and Sea battles. Fight Land, Siege, and Naval battles. ETW introduced naval battles with the historical, monsterous Ships of the Line.- 100 years to play (1700-1800) 2 turns per year. 100 years. 200 turns - Great Historical Battles- A Vast technology tree parted into thirds.Enlightenment, Economics, and Military- Religion is a major factor for the last time in a Total War series. [/i]Choose your state and spread their religion to conquered lands.[/i]- Revolutions! One of the best features in the game and certainly the most notable. Choose from 3 kinds of government; Absolute Monarchy, Constitutional Monarchy, or dare you be...a Republic? This was the age of many revolutions, and as such, you'll choose whether to uphold the status quo and put down rebellions or begin a revolution against your own nation.- Multiplayer Land, Naval, or Siege battles.-----------Cons:- The AI, as in many TW games, is not all that great.- Minor bugs & glitches.- Unfair rep in the TW family.DLC- The Warpath CampaignPlay as any of the 5 Native American factions fighting amongst themselves and the foreign invaders. This is a mediocre and very difficult DLC.- Elite Units (Sold Separately)These include; Elite Units of the West, Elites Units of the East, Elite Units of America, and the Special Forces & Bonus ContentI recommend buying all of the Elite Unite packs. The Warpath Campaign is one of, if not the only Total War DLC that can'y really recommend.Verdict:9/10There are probably just as many negative critics of the game as there are fans, but this is truely one of the great Total War games to present day. If you like guns, you'll love this addition. There's so much replay value on this game (hense my hours played) and I really do recommend it to those looking to buy a TW game. This is simply unique in the series and set in a great time period. I also highly recommend that if you install any mod, that it be the simplistic but affective Total Factions Mod.

												Basically, I'm addicted to this game.  When I feel like some quick entertainment a little Road to Independence is in order.  This is especially fun when you put it on the hardest setting and promptly cream the red coats at Bunker Hill.  Watching them run away is completely gratifying.Once in awhile it is enjoyable to sink a Spanish Galleon with an 18 gun sloop.  It's nice to have guns that shoot farther than the big boy's guns.  Layoff in the distance, knock out the masts with chain, and then have at the immobile hulk.As far as campaigns, so far I've taken on England, Prussia, Austria, Maratha, and the United Provinces.  The biggest challenge to date was playing the Dutch.  They are badly spread out and there is too much to defend.  However, on the 4th try I finally figured out that the road to success was to simply abandon trying to defend Ceylon.  Milk it for the money while you can, but when Maratha invades it's time to pack up and leave.  There will be a time to come back to get it later.If you concentrate on the Dutch army at home, and play aggressively with small armies in the Americas it's possible to make headway in the Americas while you knock out France quickly and early.  This breaks up their American colonies and you can pick them off one by one.  The European army needs to work quickly.  Once France is out it's time to take out Spain.  Those galleons are big and tough and with Spain out, its colonies also break up.  With America firmly in hand (say 10 or so provinces) and with another 10 or so in Europe it's time to raise that army and go back and take Ceylon.  Maratha is a lot easier target than Prussia and Sweden, and those elephants aren't nearly as tough as they look at first.  I've been playing the current game for a LONG time now.  It's 1783, and the United Provinces control all of India, all of Europe except for Greece and 12 Ottoman provinces, and all of the Americas except for the northern Indian provinces, Quebec, and 8 US provinces.  Austria just fell (Hungary, Austria, and Bavaria all fell on the last turn).  I'm repositioning troops, and will invade Greece with 2 armies.  These will be positioned for a quick attack on Rumelia, while individual armies go after the other two provinces the Ottomans have in Europe proper.  Other armies will fall on the Middle Eastern provinces, and 2 armies will be ferried to Africa to take out their two African provinces. I'm currently fighting in America with 3 armies, but will transfer armies from Europe as soon as possible to conquer 100% of the world before 1799.  I'm also 4 turns away from researching all technologies, also a first for me.  Great game, I'm thinking of trying either Russia or Poland next.  Not sure I'll ever play the frogs.  It's too much fun watching France get eliminated.Another fun thing to do is to defend a fort against forces that badly outnumber you.  Occasionally the computer sends my guys out the gates or over the walls at the enemy, but if you pay attention you can order them back inside so that they don't get wiped out.  Nice to hold the fort at the end of a long battle with all of the enemy units broken and fleeing the field!Definitely recommend the game.  I save frequently so can always back up to a prior save if a glitch comes up.  I've found that the glitches don't tend to repeat themselves.			",0,0,0,0,1,0,3

												My first ever dip into the Total War franchise, and what a plunge it turned out to be. I managed to pick it up for £3.75, and seeing the high scores it was achieveing on metacritic on fueled my purchase. And for what it turned out I bought, £3.75 was a steal!The game itself may seem a little daunting at first as you meet the gigstntic map, and play your first RTS battle, but as you begin to gain experience, and attempt to control the world, you pick it up very quickly and easily.The whole turn based strategy map that you control is fantastically done, as you feel almost god-like when peering down at the continents. The AI may not be the smartest, but with a few simple mods, you can almost feel them breathing down your neck everytime you make your move. The Technology tree has to be one of the best I've had the privilege to play around with, as I could instantaneously feel the effects of my chosen advancement. The RTS is the best I have ever played, with the vastness of iit all taking your breath away. Controlling 100s if not 1000s of troops with just a click of your mouse is always a joy to play, and I have taken many screenshots of my epic moments on the battlefield. Like X-com, you'll forge stories foy ur troops as you valiantly defeat a far superior army, or cumple under an army of only 300.The era is also very interesting with the use of muskets. This adds an interesting dynamic to the battles, and requires quick thinking to ensure your men are set up correctly to take down the opposing line. For this reason, cavalry are of upmost importance and requires that little edge to out maneuver the opponent.Empire: Total War has to be one of my most satuisfactory purchases, and has given me a bottomless well of enjoyment, and I would still be playing it if my life allowed me. Nevertheless I find myslef dipping in now and then often to match up against my brother, after a petty quaral. When a game can hook you, and keep you hooked like it did to me, you know it's something special.			",211,35,9,23,18,5,33

												The simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started.Empire: Total War is a masterful combination of all the things that I love about strategy games -- a great setting, a first-rate presentation, tactics that reward maneuver, and a strategic layer that requires flexibility in your plans...Simply put, if you're a fan of strategy games, this is one game you must have in your collection.Empire: Total War is breathtaking in its scope, enthralling in its detail, and staggering in its execution. Despite one or two minor flaws, it should be considered one of the very best strategy titles available on any platform.Looking for errors in this game is pretty hard, but the sluggish controls and small AI quirks prevent Empire: Total War from scoring perfect. Still, it’s a feast for every strategist.This is one of the most sophisticated, entertaining, and historically accurate strategy games ever made.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												For a Real Time Strategy game this one is one of the better ones I've played. It's a good system, smooth flowing and surprisingly good detail in graphics for having so many soldiers on screen at one time. It's focused on the late 1700s around the colonization of the Americas. It allows you to play as multiple factions in a type of free play. It's not an overwhelming story depth but for RTS games they are more for replay ability in my opinion. I've done several world domination games and it never gets old. Play as Britain, France, Spain, Sweden or somewhere else. You choose. My only complaint in games like world domination where your goal is to take over the world (obvious right?) you can't play as small factions like the American Colonies. Personally I would like to train them and slowly build them to take over the world but it's not an option. This game thought is a pretty amazing Real Time Strategy and trust me I've play a lot of RTS games and this one is a great one. I loved it and if you give it a try you probably will too!I give it a 90/100			",123,8,15,14,23,0,21

												Personally, i throughly enjoy this game. It has a greatly expanded campaign map, tons of factions, and a much better diplomacy interface. On the downside, the AI is rather difficult, and often borders on(and crosses into...) being incredibly dumb. Battle mechanics are great, with better UI, better graphics, and expanded options. I like the ""take cover"" selection that allows units to hide in buildings, or next to fences. They handled the change from melee-based combat, with little ""ranged combat"", to a system with very nearly soley ""ranged"" combat mecanics very, very well. The addition of Naval Battles is an extrordinary change, as all previous games had the ""autobattle"" for sea combat(or in the case of med 1, random battles popping up as 'events' against the primarily land-based campaign), and i throughly enjoyed learning how to command such a sea battle. If you're looking for a TW game, or even just a nice game to play, and one that will not be a ""short play-through"", then i heartfully recomend ETW.10/10 for me.			",8,1,0,1,11,0,17

												Its hard to pick a favorite Total War game, but Empire has absorbed more of my time than any other game on Steam, by far. Deploying sharpshooters as skirmishers, rushing forward artillery, deploying the main army in line battle, having cavalry duels at the flanks... Empire is intense, and its even better with any number of mods available.			",146,45,3,23,29,0,46

												Empire: Total WarPositives:+ Research tree which allows you to unlock additional technologies for your nation. These technologies directly affect income, military advancement and building options, fuelling your progress towards modern industrialisation with factories and steam mines.  + Decent graphics.+ Massive campaign map to play on, including the Americas, Europe and India which results in a lot of replayability and exploration. + Good selection of campaign map agents. Rakes honourably duel other rakes, sabotage enemy cities and carry out assassinations. Religious agents like missionaries, brahmin or imams convert the population, and gentlemen can steal enemy research from universities or speed up technology acquisition in your own. + Real-time tactical battles where you can command up to thousands of soldiers, cannons and cavalry at the same time. Naval battles also feature in this game and they're quite epic!+ Realistic diplomacy system. + Good trading system. The 18th century was centered on lucrative trade operations with other countries and this is reflected in Empire: Total War. Export cotton, tea, cocoa and sugar from your plantations to other nations for gold.+ Huge assortment of units at your disposal. With the addition of DLC packs (which aren't expensive) every nation has unique units and each playthrough feels different. + Multiplayer mode so you can play battles against a friend if they have the game.+ Four difficulty levels that will match a player of all skill levels - very hard is a true challenge!Negatives:- Battle AI could be more intelligent. One who is skilled at land battles won't find themselves challenged very much. However, in the light of everything Empire: Total War does so well, this problem can be overlooked.Overall Score: 10/10Empire: Total War has to be the best Total War game made to date. Released in 2009, it is still  highly respected in the turn based RTS genre to this day.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												Empire: Total War is a strategy game from Creative Assembly and published by SEGA. It is the next installment in the Total War series. Empire: Total War set in 18th century.Empire: Total War still retain some gameplay element from the previous Total War, but majority of it were improved and changed. Settlement are no longer centralized, now each province also include minor towns and villages that deal with trade or technology aside from the central settlement. This allow factions to disrupt a province's productivity without assaulting the main settlement. Diplomacy, taxation, and trade have been someway streamlined which means less faction micromanagement. In the previous Total War, governor needs to be appointed in each settlement and each governor only affect the settlement where he present. In Empire: Total War, we appoint ministers to form a cabinet or court to govern the nation, which mean the ministers will affect the whole nation settlement. Also a research tree has been implemented. The way agent works has also been changed. There are only 3 types of agent now, Rakes, Missionary and Gentlemen. For the first time in Total War series, a naval battle has been added where you can engage in ship to ship battle, boarding enemy ships and such. Naval battle is the most epic gameplay in this game. Land battles now takes different approach. You now will command army of musket rifleman who no longer engage in melee combat, and artillery cannons will play big roles in each battle.Empire: Total War also has better and improved graphics. Everything from the skies to the ground has been improved. You will see a lot of smoke effect now from the fired rifle and field cannons. Water shaders is the best improvement in the game, makes naval combat more epic. Units animation are more smooth than ever, but still not optimized when they stationed on fort walls.Performance of Empire: Total War is good but not really optimized. The game will run just fine most of the time, and is playable regardless.Empire: Total War is the next generation of Total War series after Medieval 2: Total War. With improved gameplay and graphics, the game is really good. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Next to Medieval 2, Empire is the best Total War title.  The era in which it takes place is perfect for the total war engine and CA definitely outdid itself.  With the addition of naval combat comes a welcome expansion of the gameplay and ensures that hundreds more hours will be committed to the game.  A must-have for any RTS fan.			",130,13,2,8,10,2,39

												   I have never been disappointed by any of the total war series. Empire is certainly one of the best.  The land battles, and the sea battles are epic. Diplomacy can be a bit difficult, and empire management takes more time  as you progress, but it is all worth it in the end. Do yourself a favor, and get familiar with this one.

 Massive Empires, Wings of Glory, and moody Campaign AI  Introduction Empire Total War is comparable to an outdated grandparent, an old dusty yet beloved teddy bear stashed away in the closet, or your one and only soul mate, who may thoroughly anger you, yet you still love them with every beating ounce of your heart. Empire Total War is just that; although the game may be annoying, outdated, and frusturating, one can simply not resist to love the game, which, in its own way, is quite the masterpiece.  Empire: Total What? For those readers who do not know, the Total War series is a well established set of games in which the player controls a nation, its politics, trade, finance, and of course, its military conflicts. Now do not rush to quickly classify Empire as a boring tactical game void of action, this is where the Total War games, especially Empire, truly surpass other games of the same genre. The player experiences two seperate ""gaming styles/points of view"", the first being the campaign map, where the player may see their entire nation, select cities, construct buildings, develop trade networks, and move one's troops around the map to face enemy forces or conquer cities. The player can also move navies around the ocean to establish trade and face enemy fleets in naval warfare. Now this is where the Total War games really put the ""Total"" in the phrase, the player controls one's forces in the actual battles! In the battles the player can micro manage his or her forces, telling them when to go, what to do, who to shoot or charge, and so on. The naval aspect is quite similair, the main difference being... it's on water, duh. The greatest aspect of the battles is that they are comparable to actual battles that took place at that time. Meaning, the battles are ""actual size"" and a player can have thousands of troops on screen fighting it out as if watching a line battle from a front row seat in the 1700's. Silly reader, you won't be watching, you will be the one commanding the forces. General Overview Empire has a significant amount of glitches that truly drain from the overall experience in many cases. The game also was not, in my opinion, developed to its full potential. Make no mistake, the game's sweeping and vast campaign map, numerous playable factions, and unique controllable units are truly capable of blowing the player away. There is just so much to conquer and gaze at! Despite the game's several draw backs, Empire: Total War is truly a ""Must Buy"". Graphics It should be taken into consideration that Empire: Total War was released in 2009. Thus, the graphics aren't mind blowing. On the highest graphics setting, the game can truly be quite appealing to the eye. Unfortunately however, the ""Ultra"" setting requires a considerably decent computer to have the graphics and still have the game run smoothly. I personally do not have the best gaming computer, but she definitelty ""gets me by"" with this game. On the weaker computers, the lowest graphics setting is the player's most probable safe bet. However, the player should note that he or she would be sacrificing the overall asthetic appeal of the game. Animations are not affected on the lower settings, however your experience will be more like of that of a one good eyed 93 year old with 10/20 vision.(Don't quote me on the vision statistic, I believe that's quite low however.) The in-game troops will look quite commical with petrifyingly lowly detailed faces. However, it must be noted that there are thousands of said ugly gentle fellows. That leads me to another topic, there are a select number of female units, huzzah! Anyways, the main point being, don't expect to see beautiful graphics on a weaker computer running the lower graphic settings. Keep in mind however, the game does look quite appealing on the higher graphics settings. Oh, here we go... AI Now, I will attempt to remain as well mannered as possible throughout this paragraph, the reason being: the AI can in some instances (if not a considerable amount) be plain stupid! On both the campaign map and in battles the AI troops rarely fail at aggravating the player to the extent of doing his or her own bayonet stab at the screen. In battle, the enemy CPU may do many unpredictable things such as: Not moving a single inch, meaning you must come to them Completely ignoring any sense of tactics and charging straight into your poised and ready to fire artillery Forming unrealistic formations My personal favorite, running together and forming a massive blob just to flip and switch with another unit on the opposite flank. This is actually quite amusing when the player has artillery... the reason can be summarized in two words: Target Practice. Refusing to attack your fort during a siege battle. I believe a vain just popped after writing that sentence, as it reminded me of many painful hours of agony.These examples are the most frequent and most aggravating, there are always a few small battle glitches here and there which differ from these. However, they rarely take away from the battle experience. Campaign AI on the other hand has very little if any glitches, there are however, many annoying things which the CPU likes to do that is not always realistic or convenient. A couple of these things are: Splitting their forces into single units (forces appear as a soldier holding a flag on the campaign map) Multiplying at the rate of mosquitosOther than these annoyances, however, the campaign map is quite enjoyable. Other Nations on the Campaign Map On a positive note, there are so many playable nations to choose from! This is one of the greatest aspects of Empire that the game developers of Total War should definitely persue to implicate in future Total War games. I will mention however, that there are a few historical inaccuracies. Relations between some countries for example, such as that of the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, where historically Russia was slowly taking over the Commonwealth with the help of Prussia and Austria. However, in-game the player starts out with Russia being an ally of the Commonwealth if he or she chooses to play as Poland-Lithuania. Let's not get into historical arguments however, I could ramble for days on end.  One main issue  of the nations in the campaign map is that on the higher difficulties, the nations simply refuse to partake in trade and other negotiations. This may get quite aggravating and unrealistic, so a player searching for a challenge should most likely set their battle difficulty on ""Very Hard"" and campaign difficulty on ""Hard"". Personally, I have found that this combination provides me with the most enjoyable gaming experience.  So much potential! Unfortunately, Empire does not achieve many aspects that it is capable of accomplishing. For example, there could be so many more options in what the player could do to a city after conquering it. (This is actually addressed in more recent Total War games, hooray!) Also, the massive and expansive campaign map should be MORE massive and expansive. Give me the whole world for goodness sake! I want it all! The  campaign map features every single contintent except for Australia, Antarctica, and Eastern Asia. The game DOES include the region of present day India as well as the middle east. Go crazy sand junkies... and stay away Anakin Skywalker. However, there is just so much more of the world that could have been included. Regardless, the map is quite sizable. Conclusion  Empire:Total War is truly a magnificent game that shines through its set backs and glitches. I highly reccomend the reader to purchase and play the game to have the wonderful experience of immersing onself into the glitchy yet lovable 1700's.Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope you found it helpful! Happy gaming! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big fan of all the Total War games! No other grand strategy war games takes on whole eras of combat with such a combination of respect and fetishism for the rules and wisdom of battle, and no series treats history like such a serious playground of possibilities. If you have the time and the dedication, all the Total War games will shower you with gaming glory and riches, Empire is no exception. And as a personal bonus for me, this game has my ancestors, the Kalmyks, as special cavalry unit (which are very rarely mentioned in video games)!

												This game can be a lot of fun, but there are so many little annoyances that all add up to create an insanely frustrating experience in the vanilla version of the game (if you want to avoid half of the mess, download Darthmod to fix many of the bugs that Creative Assembly has kindly left in the game). This game has been patched more than my old pair of highschool jeans, and yet, diplomacy and declarations of war are still seemingly decided by the toss of a coin, rather than the global situation. Increasing the difficulty level doesn't even make things more demanding on the battlefield (The AI has the mental ability of a toddler, even on the very hard setting) but on the campaign map, someone decided that making the game ""challenging"" on higher difficulties involves every nation declaring war on you at the same time very early on for no reason.  Difficutly should be based around the player's skill level and their ability to complete REALISTIC objectives - Having every nation jump on you like the crabs of a million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, does not meet this criteria. Furthermore, the only way I'm able to reliably establish trade with other nations is for me to offer the technological equivilent of a thermonuclear weapon, in exchange for the ♥♥♥♥ing wheel. If you're patient, and you enjoy 18th century history and warfare like I do, then please play this game with mods enabled to avoid a headache. Otherwise, play Shogun 2, or any of the previous Total War games as they are far superior to this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My other two vessels get ready to swing around the line of ships I set, just waiting. They're close enough.FIREShip plows throughFIREShip plows throughFIREShip plows throughFIREShip decides to retreat. It's to damaged to return, but the other 10 begin to turn their hulls so that the can fire. Perfect! They've sailed close enough. I bring my ships out from behind under the cover of cannon shells. The easily flank the ships, as they are smaller, the manueverablility is much higher. The cannons tear through 2 ships hulls as they sink to the ground. While there is still chaos of a split force, I bring my two ships up in a frontal assauslt. If you can imagine, I have two ships plowing into the enemy line, while the other two have flanked them and make sure they can't flank.I end up winning with one ship lost and the other three having severe damage. The enemy's lost all of their ships.My ships reach america with the supplies.9 / 10 would rek again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing the Total War games for over six years. I have not only been playing, that genre - but I always returned. The first game I ever brought on Steam, was ""Empire Total war"".I fell in love with this game at first sight. So many possibilities with everything. You are the leader of your own nation. You have total control, which can lead to the rise of a mighty empire or the fall of a small one.Keep good relations with the major nations and keep your economy in check. I myself have played this a lot, so I always play at at least hard difficulty. This will give you a feeling of really fighting for every land, instead of just conquering like if it was a piece of candy in a candystore. Most of historic games today are about the 20-century, so I really apreciatted this game. It is really cheap now, and even through it is a little old by now, then it is still a classic. If you want the graphics and gameplay to fit the new times, then download the mod ""Darthmod"" to the game. It makes it better than before <333I rate this game 1933/10			",98,15,1,8,7,3,17

												I easilly give this game 10/10.  Have played TW games since the first Medieval, and as soon as I saw the trailer for naval battles I had been itching to buy it.  Let 7 years pass, and the game is still amazing.  Only complaint is that Creative Assembly changed the original uniforms, albeit for historical accuracy, but still liked the old uniforms, and they've grown on me.  I would like to be able to play as other factions, and have changes made to the US faction campaign to allow for Regular infantry to be recruited in Africa and India like the European powers.  However, I easily recommend this game to any lovers of strategy games.  Also, check out Darthmod for E:TW.  Makes units bigger, changes up gameplay, great addition to a fantastic game.  Hope Creative Assembly revisits this era in future games.  Would LOVE to see what else they add.			",79,3,0,13,24,2,29

												Although it has it's flaws, Empire: Total War, in my opinion, is the best Total War game ever made. It's historical accuracy in Campaign play is so accurate it can actually teach you a lot of history (especially if you read the in-game descriptions). The content of the game is really diverse. The weaknesses and strenthgs of each individual faction in the game is set realistically & historically accurate. The unique units factions possess are also great & historically accurate (The British having the Blackwatch Elite Infantry, The Maratha with the Elephants, The Ottomans with the 64-iber Artillery and the fearsome Organ Gun). I also really like the fact that you can create your own alternate timeline/history via the use of revolutions and other new features intoduced that did not exist in previous Total War games. Although minor, some flaws of this game are that the Campaign AI is sometimes stubborn af (they won't accept deals no matter what you offer them), Cavalry is very weak and have almost no effect in battles, and some minor limiting things, such as not being able to liberate a nation or a region without causing an intentional rebellion in the region, which takes 3 turns to onset. However if you play this game with DarthMod installed, it will basically make the game flawless. This game was also the first Total War game to have a fully incorporated Naval Battle System which was a huge advance in the Total War series. If you are a dedicated Total War fan like me and if you like historical accuracy in games, then this game is a must have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Total War EmpireThis is a really good Total War game. It is more up to date than Medieval II (good game) and playes much better than Napoleon or Shogun II. Shogun II runs badly and has balance issues, whereas Napoleon has few enemies (although those few enemies have large territories.)You get to perform research in Empire. I do wish the research tree was larger for Battle and Economic areas. It is very large on Philosophy. The units are nice. All three arms of the military, infantry, cavalry and artillery, are equal in this time period and thus all three types of units have a role on the battlefield. Having a good mix of these works really well.Generals can be appointed easily and troops can move and attack without generals.Trading is neat. Diplomacy works well too.Ship battles are cool.Anyway, this is a good Total War title. I had no problems getting the game to run in Win 7 64-bit. Good game.			",36,24,0,42,19,0,59

												The United Provinces is flourishing. They have now conquered Morocco, and have deimated the Nation of France. All of the Island territories belonging to the French and Pirates are now under their control.The Nordic nations have now bent the knee, with Denmark being forced to retreat to Iceland, remaining as Protectorate.The Indian theater of war has seen bloody battles for the United Provinces. The people of Meysore have fallen, and the Marathan Confederacy are decimated. The Mughal Empire is weary, and demands a peace, to which I must agree. Then, as nobody had expected, THE SPANISH INQUISITION. Like a swift manouver, suddenly the province of France is obtained. Morocco falls, and then the American territories fall. One by one, the Spanish Inquisition takes the United Provinces by storm. Soon, Russia invaded me in the winter. The Scandanavian countries fall, the Prussians get in on the action, and take Copenhagen.Watching from my Palace, I see the Empire crumble. Soon the valiant men of Amsterdam must defend against the coalition. Russians, Prussians and Spanish have all joined to defeat this once proud nation. The brave men of Amsterdam try, but fail. I have been defeated. I then proceed to walk away from my computer, stand in my shower, and cry in the cold, icy water.			",29,3,0,2,4,0,9

												Empire: Total War is a turn-based strategy game that starts in the year 1700. Playable factions are the great powers in Europe, parts of North & South America and Indian subcontinent at the time. The game had a rough start at its release and crashed a lot and wasn't well optimized. Most things have been patched in the meantime though.Best strategy is to ignore your enemy's army all together and to blitz his regions. His troops will disappear entirely if you have conquered all regions of your enemy's home theatre.+ The map is quite big+ a lot of factions to choose from+ a lot of mods that improve on the base game+ You can let your people revolt to change your government type. Do it as France to get the cool flag.+ economy is interesting+ trading colonial resources is OP+ research tree- unit variety is poor. most factions felt the same- the AI is very bad on the campaign and battlefield map.- barely any naval invasions- fort battles are broken- the Ottoman turn freeze bug and the save corruption bug still aren't fixed.- still not that well optimized.- Some factions need more regions. You can finish off some factions like France by conquering their two only regions in their home theatre (here: continent), which is way too easy.- As soon as one Indian faction unites all of India, prepare to fight a monster. Felt a bit ahistorical.- Switzerland is not accessable. You can't even march through the country.Bug workarounds- Ottoman turn freeze bug (Ottoman's turn takes a long time: Seize Istanbul and attack all of the little Ottoman armies. But conquering Istanbul helped the most in my experience.- Save corruption bug (you suddenly can't load your saves anymore): Play one turn to get one autosave. Then, leave the game and go to your save files in C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\The Creative Assembly\Empire\save_gamesChange the autosave to ""Read-only"". It didn't happen afterwards for me. Don't forget to still save manually of course.Replay value: Potentially high (with a lot of factions and many regions)Rating 8/10Recommendation: Yes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire Total War (ETW) is by far one of the greatest turn-based strategy games I've ever played. In my opinion, ETW takes place in one of the most fascinating centuries in history. I love learning about certain eras of history, and the 18th century is one of them. Anyone that is new to the Total War series, ETW is a definite must have game.    This is no game for the faint of heart or some chump looking to pacify his or her ADD for a measly thirty minutes. Empire is all about micromanaging every aspect of your country. For those who don't have the balls to handle everything that's thrown at you, there is hope. You can opt to have the computer manage the economy and construction for you. However,  in doing so you will only cheat yourself by reducing the game to a cheap simulated version of Risk. At the very least, I'd recommend a sold hour of gaming time, so plan accordingly.    I'm a pretty hard-core gamer, which means I love playing games on the hardest settings. For better or for worst, my satisfaction can only be quenched  by conquering a game while the odds are stacked against me.  If you have a top-shelf gaming machine with all the bells and whistles, I recommend maxing out all the graphic options. In doing so, you'll truly appreciate all the fine visual details this game has to offer.    Lets get down to what really matters. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly:The Good:* ​​One of the most immersive strategy games available in the gaming market. In-fact, any stand alone game in the Total War series is worth its weight in gold. * ​The replay value of this game is off the charts. Each playable country offers slightly different types of challenges. Although the overall objectives are still the same: Manage resources. Build-up your military. Go kick the sh*t out of people.  You'll quickly realize the road to success is not identical for each country.*​ This game is cheap as hell! Seriously, $9.99 + tax! That's nothing less than highway robbery!*​ Spending your Friday night playing this game with a full rack of your favorite beer and snacks is going to = one hell of a good time. You'll be bewildered at the countless hours that just fly bye.​The Bad:* ​The load times can seem very tedious. * ​You not owning this game is bad. It's more than bad, it's an f'ing tragedy! What are you waiting for?! Go buy this game!​The Ugly:* ​There is no ugly, there's only you still reading this instead of playing this epic game!			",66,0,0,15,6,0,12

												For this game, the question of recommendation is difficult. It's target audience is narrow, but chances are you're interested in this genre if you bothered to scroll down to the reviews.The biggest point on this game is that it's time consuming. VERY time consuming. With a schedule like mine you can't get much done within one sit-down, but that keeps making me come back for more, for better or worse.As for historic accuracy, I'm moderately educated on the time era of this game, but some events don't really add up. The AI's don't really act in accordance to actual history. For instance, Sweden likes to destroy Denmark within 15 seasons. I've also run into the problem with my closest allies suddenly declaring war on me, even though we're in ""very friendly"" relations.Aside from those problems, this game has great complete features. The armies and naval battles play out well, and the detail is good for an older game. I'd recommend this to anyone that actually bothered to dig into the recommendations.			",34,4,0,4,1,0,3

												I've played Total War since Medieval II and ever since, this has been one of the finest. If you have been looking for a game that deals with the age of gunpowder and the political and diplomatic instability of the 1700s, look no further. Although more recent Total War games now have access to the Steam Workshop, Empire still has some amazing modders out there. This review is kinda short but lol okay... 8.5/10... Kinda buggy though at times			",23,4,0,4,9,0,10

												Empire Total War is among the older games in my Library, and like Napoleon, it sparked an interest for the era in which it was set. It's one of the many games Creative Assembly has made under its tarnished name, raising our hopes with the epic cinematics they stick on the front of every game. If only they actually looked like that... Get ready for this. It's yet another Total War game. Ok, I made it sound like a new release. It isn't. It's older than Napoleon Total War, and that really shows when you play it. It has a similar look and feel to its closest family member, but it's much more rough too, in many ways. So, to the game then. It's set in the American War of Independence (no doubt THEY love it already), which was a very intense era to set it in. The choice was a good one, and provides plenty of content for the game. That is not something it lacks. The main campaign under ""Road to Independence"" puts the fate of this new nation in your hands, as you must lead it to a triumphant victory, securing America's place on the world stage...a place it's never since left...no, we're not going there :) #MakeAmericaGreatBritainAgain ... And you actually can here ;] The games campaign has the same concept as all total war games. You have to manage this nation, itss military, itss government, etc. and build it into the strongest player on the map. In Empire, the map is much bigger so there is a fair amount of competition. Unlike Napoleon, it covers Europe, India and obviously, the Americas. Before this review loses the structure of a review, I will get on with actually 'reviewing' the game now. Ok, so the 'Road to Independence' campaign leads you through several treacherous years of fighting for the Jamestown settlers as their settlement becomes many more...and eventually, the Thirteen Colonies. It's a thriving nation, but unstable, and as we all know, all hell breaks loose in 1776, and the founding fathers declare America free from the Tyrannical rule of Great Britain. Yea...I have no opinion on that WHATSOEVER. There is also a campaign option where you can play as some better - I mean other...totally. Other nations. These include Austria, Great Britain, France, Prussia...you know, the superpowers of the era. This is a much bigger campaign as the whole map is open to you at this point. The length and difficulty at which you set the campaign will only enhance that. It is a very detailed world map, which you can view in 3 parts, under ""Europe"", ""The Americas"", and ""India"" I think it was. It can surely get hectic having to micro-manage all of that, but hey, that's your problem. Good luck :)The battles, which is where most people spend their time I suppose, well...they are something. I really love Empire and I have no idea why because the battles are quite bad, upon serious consideration. It was supposed to be a good idea that units turn slightly to face enemy units better before firing. Honestly...no. It takes that long that they never get time to fire, it's stupid. The game is in itself quite clunky, and nothing really runs smoothly. However, as much as it is a game destroyer (to me, not at all. Skyrim is the same) it is really quite in-keeping with the era. That old, battered, rustic feel that the game has actually enhances it in a rather odd way.  That leads me finally on to the graphics...They are bad, but they are good. Yea. I have the American Civil War mod on most games now and it actually looks best on Empire. It's again, old, battered, rustic graphics are undeniably the best for it, and the likes of Shogun 2 with its ""perfect"" smoothness just can't live down to it. I know that review was kinda long but hey, I was feeling sarcastic, so I went for it. Overall, Empire gets 8/10 for me. My heart goes out to it really, it's got a great era, but it's not in the best state for a game. Yea...I feel sorry for it. Get over it. It still has annoying problems like men taking forever to fire, men charging away from the enemy you told them to charge at, and artillery clitches etc...but without these annoying faults, Total War would be nothing, right? Oh yea.... I forgot...Thanks all for reading my review. Any offended Americans feel free to rant at me in the comments. Alternatively, take the joke. Up to you. Hope you all enjoyed! Even you, Americans! :) ♥			",102,29,1,10,16,0,14

												I had a job to do. My country, Great Britain, had just been through a century of unparalleled turbulence: an unwelcome joining of Scotland and England; religious strife; civil wars; an executed king; military dictatorship; a populist monarch restored; and the overthrow of a second king. Less than 15 years ago, the hated Catholic James II was forced into exile in the Glorious Revolution and a Protestant monarchy restored. A short, vicious war in Ireland put paid to any chance of a Catholic Stuart restoration. Nonetheless, the exiled James Stuart has sympathisers, the Jacobites, throughout Britain. Despite - or perhaps because of - this turbulent history, Britain is an engine driving the scientific and cultural advancement of northern Europe; turmoil foils creativity.My job was fueled by my ambition and patriotism. I was to turn my country, previously fighting internally, to face outwards across the sea. Take possession of colonies in the America's and India. Destroy the French. Create the East India Company. Destroy the French. Take the archiapelago of Meditterannean islands and turn them into naval bases. Destroy the French. Use these naval bases to invade mainland Europe. Destroy the French.

Empire: Total War™Empire is a true Total War game and one of my favourites. It is all about historical gameplay in the 18th century.It is worth every penny and it really deserves its positive reviews. It is time for my own review after I got the last achievement in Empire:(My review is based on the game without mods) [v1.6]Pro+ Although the game is from 2009 the graphic ist still good+ Interesting and nice battlefields: Take cover in buildings, fields, hiding behind walls and fences etc.+ Unit detail is good and the animations are well made+ Naval battles need a bit exercise but once you know how it works they are great+ Huge map (You can fight in North America, a bit in South America, Europe, partly Africa, Russia and India)+ Trading routes in South Africa, South America and in the Asian regions to boost your income+ There is a Pirate faction (Caribbean)+ Fighting with firearms, cannons etc. is a great experience+ Huge battles+ Units talk to you in their own language+ You can place ""forts"" on the campaign map+ Technology research is made in universities and divided in more branches+ You can steal technologies+ Religion and diplomacy+ Weather effects+ Native Americans+ Armies can destroy important villages etc.+ Great sound, ambient music = great feeling+ Revolutions (can create a new faction with its own flag etc.)+ Historical background information+ A high replayability due to the whole feeling of this historical era, captured in this detailed game+ Friendly fire!Con- The AI is sometimes gamebreaking bad. It is passive and has a bad pathfinding. Simply, it has often no strategy...- There is no multiplayer campaign or a co-op mode- Sieges are, how can I say it... boring, nearly everytime the same sh...- No general or admiral speeches. I mean, it's an era for heroes and you have nothing to say to motivate us?- Generals are weak and have no real skills- Although the naval battles are great, I wish they were more polished if you know what I mean- Pirate faction unplayable- The drummers play always the same ""marching"" sound- I wish there had been partly a real soundtrack with music of the era- I miss expeditions in South America and Native factions on that continent- I'm not sure but slavery in colonies or in general is not existing at all- Diplomacy is good but it really could have been more than what it is now...- Friendly fire!ConclusionAll in all, Empire is a great game. The 18th century is a fresh and interesting era to play. There is a lot to discover and to conquer. Also, there are a lot of interesting mods to install. If you ask me, the game is a must have!Have fun!English is not my native language. Grammatical mistakes are possible :DRegards,Dead_Terror			",183,16,4,20,33,2,36

												In many ways, Empire is the peak of the TW series. For the fan of the series it is recognisable that along with Shogun 2, it makes good use of the modern game engine. As is traditional with the TW series, the campaign and battles are very well linked, giving the player a large say over their destiny.  Ever historically accurate, the tech trees, and their benefits provide infinite possibilities for gameplay. Smooth and contoured campaign and battlemaps make for an aesthetically attractive game, and the roaring online community leaves continual challenges for when one feels they have 'completed' the single player.  Overall (for me) Empire is the best title in a series which I have invested thousands of hours in. Provided a gamer finds joy in Grand Strategy, there is nno better game to exemplify the genre.

												One of the better Total War games and the first to allow you to take direct control of naval combat, which is well realized. It's also a game that doesn't take that long - you could breeze through even a 'world domination' campaign in just a day or two with most of the playable factions. The modding scene is very strong with numerous gameplay-tweaks and overhauls available to spice things up a bit. My main gripe is that, outside of the Shogun TW games, the unit rosters are among the least varied - most of the European factions have near-identical unit rosters, and their unique choices are all too often functionally identical to eachother. Only the Ottoman empire and the Maratha Confederacy really buck this trend significantly, though the Russians have a few gimmicks too. The game offers a tangible way of winning without conquering absolutely everyone through prestige victory, which is nice in principle, but in reality is still best achieved by conquering everyone. It's nice if you want to role-play a bit though. Excitingly, the game takes place in three theatres, Europe, the Americas, and India, which gives you multiple avenues of conquest. My main gripes are that Agents don't seem to grow very much. Gentlemen don't become better scholars while they are researching in a school, missionaries don't seem to improve much while they are preaching. The diplomacy AI is maddeningly stupid and thinks it is winning wars even if it is being crushed, and will often refuse to aquiesce unless you have their final settlement under siege (and even then it might deny demands, or even requests for peace!). Lastly, there is too much bias on things playing out a certain way - in every campaign I've done Prussia ALWAYS stomps over central Europe. The Maratha Confederacy ALWAYS gains full control of India. The Thirteen Colonies NEVER rebel against British Rule. Part of the joy of Total war is creating and witnessing alternate history, and seeing the same things happening time after time gets a bit stale. Too much is engineered to happen or not happen. I'd love to see a game where the Mughal Empire actually manages to resist the Maratha Confederacy, or one where France and Spain actually do something over in the Americas. That's not enough to really ruin my enjoyment of the game. There is something very majestic about watching regiments of line infantry shoot the living hell out of eachother. Watching cannonballs rip through cavalry units in slow motion never gets old, and nor does mowing down foot soldiers with cannister shot. This game also has the best research tree of any of the total war games that came after. I enjoyed the way that scholars worked with schools, allowing you to really take control over how research-focussed you wanted to be.Overally I really enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, this game.

												There is something about hundreds of trained riflemen lining up and taking turns shooting eachother that's so satisfying.Empire: Total War is a great strategy game of world conquest. The grand campaign map is the largest of any Total War game, and this entry is the first to include real-time naval battles. If you ever wanted to take over the world in the early 1700s, get this game, because you are 300 years too late for that.			",130,27,1,13,14,2,39

Posted: June 2, 2016
												It's been a while since my first review of this game, so I felt it would be time to give out a more proper one. It's a good game, but not without several problems.Empire: Total War, set in the 18th century, is a game I reccomend to the player who likes the idea of massive, 18th century-style land and naval battles. The game also has a very large campaign map, including India, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. There's also a lot of colonialism involved as well, so if you like all of these things I mentioned, you'll probably like this game. However, don't expect multiplayer to be a fun experience. It's still active, but there aren't many people playing. There's a good number of players here that will mistakenly or purposefully break the rules set by players hosting their games. Even hosts will break their own rules. You also need to consider the fact that there are many players on here that have adopted the use of specific units that are simply OP, which therefore ruins the historical atmosphere of this game. Historically, most 18th century infantry were armed with highly innacurate guns, so they gathered in very large formations and fired at each other. They were called line infantry. This type of warfare was in no way meant to prolong the life of an individual soldier at all. The entire point of this type of fighting between infantry units was to use overwhelming force and numbers of troops and firepower to overcome the other side, which meant that line infantry would have to have some serious discipline and toughness. You'd rarely ever take cover, and if you were in the front lines, your slim chances of surviving the battle depended on how fast you could reload your gun and if you could make your shot count before the other side did the same thing you were meant to do. Now, you'd think line infantry would be the staple unit on this game, and therefore they'd be pretty effective. However, their historical use as the essential staple unit for 18th century armies can easily be rendered useless on this game with just three types of units: Riflemen, skirmishers, and light dragoons. The sad fact is that on multiplayer, the only three types of effective ground units that have any form of effectiveness on this game are the three units I stated above, aside from artillery. True, line infantry still have their uses, but not by much You see, the problem here is that skirmishers and riflemen have guns that can shoot farther than the muskets used by your line infantry, and they are unfairly accurate, meaning that your line infantry will be dropping like flies just trying to close the distance to take on the skirmishers and riflemen. They also reload their weapons incredibly fast. This is in no way historically accurate, because the guns used by lighter infantry forces at the time, no matter how far they shot, were still incredibly accurate and would have taken a long time to reload. Not only that, but we're talking about guns that weren't easy to aim with. I could understand how lightly armed riflemen and skirmishers could give line infantry some serious trouble in, say, a bunch of forests, but they are so overpowered on this game that they can easily take out line infantry on an open battlefield. Then there are light dragoons...Light dragoons are soldiers riding on horseback, equipped with modified muskets that have shorter barrels. Therefore, they'd be less accurate, right? In real life, yes, but in this game? Wrong. Would it be easy reloading these guns on horseback? No, because muskets need to have the projectiles loaded with ram rods, primed, blah blah blah, shoot, repeat. It's difficult enough to do all of this while standing on your own two feet, but on horseback? That's bound to take longer. Light dragoons can be incredibly dangerous to line infantry due to their superior speed, and because this game has overpowered them, every single soldier in a unit of light dragoons fires his gun, even the ones in the back. None of the troops in the front ranks of the dragoons die, and for some strange reason, a good number of the shots fired hit their mark. Sometimes, This means that you'll be having large numbers of line infantry dying all at once, which can cause a morale shock. So unless you make rules against the use of light dragoons and skirmishers on the games you host in multiplayer, you'll be seeing these units being used on a constant basis, throwing all of the great historical accuracies of 18th century warfare out the window.Now that's been explained, I should tell you about a few problems with other aspects of this game:1) Despite the fact that Empire has a very large campaign map, you will be disappointed to find that almost every single battle map looks the same. Same texture, same everything. Yes, some buildings will look different depending on what part of the world you're in on the campaign, but you will quickly realise how bland the atmosphere of the maps are when you fight battles. Building detail in towns is also severly lacking.2) The AI is incredibly dumb at times, so dumb that the developers decided to buff up the stats of the AI's units to compensate for their stupidity in the higher difficulty levels. 3) Individual troops in your army lack spatial awareness when they enter buildings or defend/attack fort walls in a siege battle. It's a horrid sight to see at times. Troops just move through each other in a frantic motion. Path finding on walls is also terrible.4) Some sound effects for this game are awful, especially for muskets. For example, when a unit of line infantry fire a volley at the enemy, you only hear a 'poof' sound. These are primitive gunpowder weapons. They should be noisy and make a loud 'bang' when fired. Instead, the muskets used by your line infantry sound like fake guns used for movies in Hollywood.5) You won't hear any general's speech before battle like you used to in Rome I and Medieval II. 6) There isn't much voice acting. You won't get to hear any voice acting at all when you initiate diplomacy, and the few bits of voice acting that you do here on this game tends to be subpar.7) Melee combat between infantry units looks decent, but not amazing. The combat animations are too drawn out and look more rehearsed than realistic. Some of the combat animations are so terrible drawn out that everything looks unrealistic.8) Because of the way the death animations work on this game, cavalry takes forever to take out a routing unit. Many times, an unnecessarily long combat animation has to be so terribly drawn out that it takes longer than needed for the cavalry to take out the routers. It'd be more convenient if the cavalry just swing their swords at boom, the routing units die faster.9) Artillery units can be glitchy, even in multiplayer. Sometimes, they won't fire their guns no matter how many times you order them to.10) On the campaign map, the AI controlling Britain, the United Provinces, and France tend to ignore India for some reason, so almost every single time you play this campaign, the Marathas end up becoming an OP faction.11) There are no marching tunes with fifes and drums on the battlefield for any of the factions. This feature should have been implemented by the developers. I can understand that some players might find them distracting, but an option could be made to just turn off those marching tunes in the game. 12) Naval battles can sometimes be a little glitchy. Ships will sometimes move unnecessarily slow even when you order them to move faster.This game can still be enjoyed despite all of these problems I mentioned. However, it will never be as great as it could have been. There are, however, a few mods for this game that you can use to make this game more enjoyable. Keep in mind that the mods are, unfortunately, not supported for Steam as there is no workshop.			",36,6,0,2,2,0,9

												After spending *hundreds* of hours of my life that I will never get back trying my best to like Rome II and Attila, I started up a new ETW game this past Saturday, and I have to say: *what a breath of fresh air*.No more attrition.  No more sanitation.  No more stressing about ""does this region have the right buildings given its fertility, and a governor with the right traits?"".  No more not being able to do something as simple as train a single militia unit to keep public order in check.  No more managing nine different agents.  All I have to worry about now is building an Empire and f'ing France!I'm not even playing with Darthmod, and I am having so much fun.  If you are looking to try out a Total War title, you cannot go wrong with this game for $4.99.  This is Total War as it's supposed to be.			",43,3,1,7,9,0,21

												E:TW provided strange but outstanding Total War experience. It was one of the worst games in the series from the technical point of view, with all its bugs and connection issues only outmatched by the horror of Rome 2 itself. But for the reasons I can't fully understand it was a keeper. Maybe that was about a fresh setting, diverse landscapes, revamped city-building, comfortable pacing, huge world to fight for or the first buggy steps into co-op multiplayer, but as a matter of fact it has a sweet nostalgic aftertaste Napoleon or Shogun 2 didn't leave for me. IF CA fixed at least some of its problems, it is definitely worth visiting while waiting for the next installment in TW series.			",14,4,0,5,4,0,17

												Although not everyones cup of tea, if you love mass scale micromanagement this game will deliver.The odd thing which I think I have been fortunate to have experienced is that over the time I have owned this game I can count the crashes on one hand.  Others have not been nearly so fortunate.You'll also want to turn up the difficulty or you will wonder how the whole world wasn't conquered by this or that faction.  In the battlefield the AI is fairly poor despite if you turn up the battle difficulty and is made up for by padding the AI stats.  Still there will be times when the enemy will sit there and be happy to let you blow them appart with long range artillery fire.  I generally autoresolve as I play for the big picture.The naval battles are nice to watch but fairly limited in tactics.  Basically you are trying to set up favorable fields of fire but generally I was able to manage favorable engagements on the campaign map eliminating the need for advanced tactics.  Essentially two lines staggered will completly crush their fleet every time.  Unless of course you failed on the campaign layer.Haven't tried MP yet because I'm an anti-social gamer.   So can't say about that one.I can see why many think this is the weakest entry in the TW series but not for me I enjoy the original Shogun and Medieval the least probably due to their age respectively.  Namely the much more limited options available.  This one looks good but does have some issues but it is also the only TW game with such a massive scope and for me, sometimes that's all that matters.			",11,0,0,3,5,0,14

												This game absolutely has its ups and downs. Gameplay-wise, it's fantastic. Map size is great, though CA did choose quantity>quality. It always feels nice battling your way through Europe and then slaughting the native Americans. The game is of course not the best in the series, functionality-wise, and sure it's not the best looking or sounding out of the box, but with some mods a lot of this can be fixed/improved upon. I do still prefer this game so much moreso than Napoleon just because of the non-linear gameplay.			",69,6,2,11,11,0,12

												CAs first real crack at focused firearm comat. This one saw many ups and downs but is still one of the most memorable Total War Games for me, though not the best. It was a truly experimental title for CA. A new engine, completely different combat mechanics, the first title to allow manual naval combat, a new era, one of the biggest campaign maps yet, and the introduction of a tech research tree. It was a breathtaking sight that, once growing pains had passed, delivered a monumental Total War experience that remains the title for which I most want a sequel. Fall of the Samurai showed just how far CA has come with this style of warfare and I cannot wait. All that being said, the game isn't without its flaws. This was the last Total War title lacking cooperative multiplayer, there are a number a bugs, the AI is predictable, especially when they are defending a siege assault, and as with all Total War titles, the AI plays by a completely different set of BS rules. Including non existant army upkeep, no resistance to occupation, agents with nigh 100% success rates... Even with its flaws, it is a unique Total War title that offers an experience no other in the series can, for now. Absolutely recommend it.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												This game is as addicting as it is nuanced.  It is a turn-based strategy game much like Civilization, but it is far more detailed (it is even more detailed than the previous Total War games that I love such as Medieval or Rome).  As a history buff, I also enjoy the fact that I can play as an 18th century power and I will get a message pop up at the start of a turn (in the appropriate year) detailing a major happening of that year in history (like the discovery of Hydrogen or Oxygen, of the first female soldier in the British Army, etc…).

Of course the undeniable best TW game for me was Rome: Total War the First, which revolutionised the series and whatever genres you might want to identify in the wider title, a game which I have dumped huge amounts of hours into - amounts which grow even to this day by the occasional intense, weekend-long binge.That opening paragraph may sound a bit contradictory - to begin with I call Empire the greatest TW title of all, then I immediately state that RTW is of course the best, but I am trying to work on a distinction, here.What I'm trying to say is that ETW was a perfect storm, if you will, a game which came at just the right time, featured just the right shift in scenery and era, brought in just the right technologies and got just the right feel of UI, interaction and general gameplay. I said before that some qualifiers exist and they do - the game is not a perfect TW title - but it gets certain things very, very right.To elaborate then, I start with the game's position in the series. If memory serves (and really how wrong could it get) the game came after Medieval 2 and the Kingdoms expansion thereof and somewhat logically endured an advancement through the ages to the Age of Empire - but it also came at a perfect technological moment that allowed it to be a true quantum leap over it's direct predecessor in many ways. The upgrade in graphics, UI, gameplay (the introduction of smaller settlements and such on the map) and the addition of naval combat - not to mention the introduction of guns, en masse (more on the flaws of this system a bit later) - all went together to make this game feel many years ahead of the earlier titles in the series, and usher in the later era that we are now enjoying.The Age of Empire just seems to perfectly lend itself to the Total War idea. Warefare by gun is just that bit more tactical, that bit more impactful and rhytmic. The battles - especially the open battles, far from fortresses and the select range of infuriating consequences to trying to breach walls - have real breadth for elaboration and intrigue... My lasting memory of a battle in Empire: Total War occured when my Dutch army, emboldened by the easy capture of Norway from the Swedes, marched on their home province only to be met by all the soldiers that should have been guarding Norway on top of the standard garrison. My army consisted of a general's body guard, two run down groups of Cavalry, and three groups of riflemen - we were up against at least twice that number - and many of those units were perfectly respectable, dangerous foes with little militia riff-raff mixed in.I had retreated from battle once after blindly commiting my army to a seige and pulling out - but that very turn the Swedes marched out to put me to the sword. Terrified, I put my troops to the rear of my deployment zone, on top of a shallow hill with a small but dense wooded forest crowning it, a vague crescent of extra-steep terrain, halfway from the crest and facing towards where the enemy would come from, and another scattering of trees further down the slope but quite a way off to a flank. I arranged two groups of cavalry - including my captain - in the dense forest, and a third group off to the opposite flank behind the scattered trees, while I lined my riflemen along the top rim of the steep section, as best as I could - the rim wasn't wide enough for one group, let alone three.The battle commenced, and a broad force of enemies set off towards my small group of men. Hanging on by the seat of my pants, I noticed a group of cavalry making a run for the flank of my riflemen that was overlooked by the dense forest, and instantly shot out both of my hidden horse groups to intercept the charge, resulting in a very quick sortie between the advancing lines and my steady riflemen. The banner of the enemy horse group flashed, marvel of marvels, and I took that as a sign to instsantly wheel around and send my horsemen back to the dense forest. briefly pursued, the opposing horse group wheeled away at the line of trees under pot shots from my riflemen, but the battle had only just begun as I sent the horses right back out again more or less instantly to counter-charge into the flanks of a huge unit of footsoldiers who had engaged my left flank. In the mean time I had done more or less the same manouver with my other flanking horsemen, breaking into the flank of a group of riflemen before wheeling away for a second charge to counter the opposing captain as they attempted to augment their advancing rifle troops with a charge by the general's bodyguard. The battle would see-saw mightily as my riflemen gamely held the high ground, wheeling this way and that to stave off probing groups of gunners, while my ragged cavalry units darted this way and that, charging, extracting themselves and charging again, trying always to lock units in pincer movements and circle around behind them to force them to flee.Miraculously, with only medium losses to ground troops and only about 50% losses to my cavalry units, I eventually forced the entirety of the enemy army to sound a hasty retreat, barring their captain! Noting that I only had one enemy left on the battlefield, I threw everything I could at him - all of my remaining horses charged his larger group from two sides,w hile up the middle charged the remainders of my three groups of riflemen, swords drawn, for the kill. A heroic victory was won that day, and with it my everlasting affection for this title.Of course, as I have hinted at, this is the greatest and grandest of the TW games in my estimations - mirroring the pomp of the setting - but it is simply not the best because of a couple of isolated by serious flaws.A) Battle BugsSadly, this game suffers from a few bugs in battle situations. At one point while I was trying to mop up some pirates in the Leeward Islands my dutch riflemen refused to open fire on pirates crouching behind a wall, despite being well in range and themselves fired upon - a group of natives who I had sent creeping around behind and sprinting along the interior of the wall likewise refused to fight the 'dug in' enemy troops unless I simply told them to run through the enemy position, forcing them to automatically swing swords at them. Likewise a group of horsemen - I love me some flanking - who had circled around the other way had to sweep through and jump over the wall in question, heading for an empty space in the middle distance, in order to finally extricate the enemies from that wall and open them up to uninhibited, bug-free slaughter.At another point, funnily enough also against pirates but this time at Port Royale, my troops of the Maratha Confederacy (I was trying to carve out some trade routes in the Caribbean) turned up with five groups of cannon and laid waste to the city walls - but not until I had lots two cannon and crew to invisible walls which forced them to walk in mid air, and this was just a prelude to the catastrophe that would be my attempt to enter into the town through the breaches in the walls - my riflemen just about struggled through in a completey buggy way, as did my elephants and such, but then half a platoon of elephants was cut down by the enemy captain, who despite being the last surviving member of his bodyguard was enjoying some kind of god mode bug as a result of being wedged between the invisible wall of the city gate and that of a section of ruined wall. I ultimately won that battle, but the unmitigated annoyance of trying to seige that settlement put my off seige battles for the remainder of my campaign - autoresolving any town that boasted fortifications.B) Unplayable FactionsI must end now, word limit, but the fact that you can only play the 'major factions' available at the start of the game kills my inner completionist.9/10			",75,6,0,24,6,0,27

 UPDATED 05/04/17 I also have to praise CA for the building system, which I personally find to be a more interesting and barely any more restricting mechanic compared to M2TW's. It makes you wonder why it was discarded for the streamlined and pathetic new building slot crap they came up with for Rome 2 and Attila... However I particularly appreciated that the player has a lot of freedom upon which bonuses he wants to favour in a certain region, in that many villages are located around each territory and you can select from a variety of building types the tree you'd like to build and develop. It doesn't mean that region X has no farms or no workshops if, for instance, you only build universities in within its boundaries, it only defines that whatever bonus the region is getting is exclusively focused in researching technologies. I find this system very intriguing and stimulating, but then to each man his own. Also do consider that towns have in most cases space for up to 5+ buildings. I have only seen a handful of capitals that allowed for 2-3 buildings, mostly being very small and insignificant provinces.  Intro pertaining Darthmod Let me start by saying I played no vanilla whatsoever, I launched the game once and then immediately set up Darthmod, and yet the features I found most astonishing and pleasant compared to other Total War instalments are unrelated to the improvements Darthmod applied. However, if what I found to be positive in the game pertains to the vanilla, so do many of the negative points I could of come across in a vanilla game, which were addressed in Darthmod. So, ultimately, indeed my review is not based on the overall quality of the product as downloaded from Steam. Way better than the most recent TW’s Like mentioned above, I consider Empire to be superior to games such as Attila or Rome II, both of which were my very first Total War games (sadly, I didn’t start with the good ol’ ones). Compared to the latter, it seems to have more interesting technologies, meaningful historical events and campaign objectives, as well as an intriguing unit variety. These superior features, so far allowed me to fully enjoy a 50 hours long campaign run, and I’m only at the 45% of it, still fighting and struggling and most importantly enjoying the game. Unlike some most recent TW’s I feel Empire is really rewarding. The technology Tree Before we delve into this, let me assure you I am not discrediting Attila and Rome II because of their theme and period. I am not just a gamer but first and foremost a scholar of the whole medieval period, from 400 to 1450 AD  (there is disagreement among historians regarding the start/end dates). What I love of Attila is in fact the time period, as I know many of the tribes and civilisations included in the game, and I have studied their migrations and customs during the Völkerwanderung. Back to the subject, compared to the stuff we have here, I find Attila’s Tech tree really uninteresting, bland, shallow. I don’t remember a single remarkable upgrade that was stuck in my head as something amazing I couldn’t wait getting my hands on. The opposite feelings I have for Empire’s tree: multiple improvements on bayonet types, on formations, or even new infantry technology (rifles in the mid-late game); then we see through the campaign an exciting development of our and other nations’ artillery, both in the engines themselves and the ammo types too. And that is just the military tree… Which on Attila I find is the most delusional one. The changes and improvements applied by the other two trees are very appealing.  Campaign objectives Short point really. What keeps me going and going on conquering without losing interest for my campaigns is that they match with historical events and conflicts that actually occurred and had an impact on how the world looks now. It’s not just random wandering and slaughtering, which some may like, and I do too, but which gets a tad boring after you run out of fantasy. ETW gives you several possible campaign ‘missions’ as you walk your path to reconstruct a historical empire or something even greater – changing the curse of history. (e.g. Austria winning the 7 years’ war, the British maintaining control over the colonies, etc). I think in this case the fault is not the most recent titles of the Total War franchise are shallow, but that the periods treated in the games are missing some relevant background for several of the factions. Maybe it’s just me, but even sailing to Britannia and making it Englaland with my Saxon spears didn’t feel to rewarding – not as much as defeating the Ottomans with Austria (see the Austro-ottoman wars for further reference). Again, it’s just my feelings and my opinion as for this point, and I can’t blame anyone or anything. Unit variety I have always been concerned by the extent of unit variety in strategy games, and I must say seldom have I been fully satisfied. Empire Total War is one of these very few cases. Playing as Austria, I haven’t a handful of basic units which then upgrade from “generic♥♥♥♥♥♥tier warband” to “mid tier warband” and then further on. I have detailed regiments, which vary depending on the region. I can muster basic line infantry, grenadiers both basic and Hungarian, and the list goes on with line infantry units, first pandurs then grenzers and further on jaegers. (Darthmod mainly adds regional versions of these units, giving some more variety). Of artillery and cavalry units there are many and all work in a different way, although cavalry diversity in Attila was proper enough and siege does not much fit the setting. However as for ETW, I am amazed at the beauty of my army composition, whereas Attila has very bland unit trees for the “barbarian” factions. If I can tell I have been impressed of some units in that game it’s the Lombards’, and unsurprisingly that faction is in a paid DLC. ;)All in all, this is just how I feel about it, and I have no wish to bother putting down numbers and making comparisons as in who has the most units and whose variety and uniqueness is superior between the two games.What I can add is that I’ve seen literally dozens of modders doing the developers’ work on the units Attila, Rome 2 and TW Warhammer contain, whereas even the biggest mods I have come across for Empire added but a handful of units. That’s really all I had to say, hope my review proves useful to someone.Thanks for reading.			",53,2,0,13,12,0,18

												I like this game. Go get Darthmod and spruce it up a bit, but it'll scratch the itch. It's on sale often enough, pick it up and just enjoy the fact that once you get engaged in it, the hours will flow by like a bubbling brook. Then your alarm goes off, oh, time for work.

												A great game. I'd almost go as far as to say that the replay value is limitless. The tech tree is large and interesting, so are the maps. There's a great variety of nations to choose from and plenty of units for each one. Multiplayer is a fun experience as long as you take care to keep the right people out of your servers (IE: clan players and other spammers.) This is to NTW what the MG42 is to the MG3. It's older, and it has its flaws, but god damn it's good. ETW will also probably last you longer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent Total War game that eliminates a lot of the uncessecary micro-management and finally offers some trule co-op multiplayer.The themes, mechanics, and graphics are top-notch however make sure you are running at least a mid-range rig as it is a total resource hog and on lower end machines will be unplayable during battles.For those die-hard fans who enjoyed the micro-management of old and variety of options when creating and managing cities, you may find this game frustrating, especially with how pivotal a role religion plays in this title (realistically in my opinion). The world is also one of the biggest in any total war game which helps and hinders gameplay in obvious ways.Overall excellent buy even at current price as I was satisfied spending 60 dollars on it at release and making it my first steam game.

												Bringing the Total War series to the gunpowder age, Empire really nails the ""line of battle"" style of warfare. It had the biggest map in the series to date, with three massive theaters to conquer and several small trade areas ripe for naval control. Diplomacy was massively overhauled, bringing much-needed improvements and making negotiating actually viable for once. It also introduced several completely new features, including epic playable naval battles and a tech tree to progress through the campaign, both of which have become staples of the series. The historical battles, while great, are less polished than normal and lack the intro cutscenes that are usually featured.There's a mini-campaign included that allows you to play as the USA through four stages of history - Jamestown, French & Indian War, American Revolution, and finally as the USA on the Grand Campaign. It's a special version of the Grand Campaign that starts at 1783 and is incredibly challenging. The biggest downside to the game, by far, is that the DLC unit packs are more or less required to have rosters that feel complete. This was CA's first game to experiment with DLC packs and they left many elite units off of the vanilla rosters, to be included in the DLC. If you get the DLC packs, then the game is amazing, but I fear for the experience of anyone trying to play it vanilla.The Warpath DLC is interesting, but a rather disappointing expansion campaign when compared to the others in the series.

I hate the clearly unbalanced factions ( Marathas and Poland do extremley well in at least 90%+ of games I have played).I hate that there are few playable factions, none in the Americas and only one in India.I hate how melee units clump up and also ""stick"" to enemy units (particularly calvary).I hate how bad the battle AI is.I hate how bad diplomacy is.I hate that I have played nearly 1400 hours since 2009 and I still keep on playing			",5,1,0,6,3,0,10

												Empire: Total War is an edition in the Total War series consisting of the titles Rome: Total War, Medieval: Total War 1/2, and many more.  Empire: Total War, if I am not mistaken, is the first Total War game in the series to introduce gunplay in battles along with user controlled naval warfare. I suggest playing the previous installments before jumping into this game.Now let's talk about this game.You start off like most Total War games by selecting who you want your faction to be. Depending on who you choose will place you on a certain part of the map. An addition to this game from the previous installments was that it used more than just Europe and a few surrounds areas. Instead it incorportated parts of Africa and North America. You could travel to the different sections of the world on your power for conquest. The gameplay consists of the player controlling cities, armies, and special units. Same as other Total War games:-Cities: Generate Revenue, Can Create Units, Expand Your Empire, ect..-Armies: Can Conqour Cities, Defend Against Enemies, Build Forts, ect..-Special Units: Spy For Subertufuge, Assassin For High Targets, Generals, ect..The main goal is the take over a certain amount of Cities before you hit a designated time period. You can fight the battles over an instant computer generated decision or you can manually control your troops on the battlefield.  Diplomacy can be made with other factions for things like trade, alliances, and much more.I enjoyed this game for the most part. While on the other hand I would recommend buying the other Total War games. Namely Rome: Total War the original and Medieval II: Total War.Thanks for reading.			",283,48,9,32,29,1,26

												This game was one of my first steam games ever. I wouldn't call it an work of art, but the huge campaign map, the beatiful (for it's time) textures and the textbook correct nations are absolutly wonderful. The variety of nations you can playas, from the OP island nation of Great Britain, to the rebelling colonists in the American theartre, and the Rebelling Maratha faction in India, this game's wide, unique and colorful blend of nations and maps are truly something worth buying this game. This is one of the best total war games out there, especially if you love 18th century history. Works perfectly with Dathmod. I highly recomend you play vanilla first, however, just to get the feeling of the great game you just bought. The battle AI could use some improvment though, other than that, great game Sega/ Total War!!!			",17,0,0,3,3,0,10

												The Total War series, who hasn't heard of it? As like all excellent Total War games I recommend you take the time to play and enjoy it in all of its glory.Compared to previous games this one has improved graphics, more complex and in depth micro management and introducing for the first time real time naval battles. What makes this game stand out from the other games in the franchise ( & makes it more interesting) is that you have several major & micro theatres of war. Since the games is set in the time of the 17th century gunpowder units & cannons are a standard sight on the battlefield which may confuse older TW players since the main part of the battle isn't a big mellee charge with an onager or two onager to provide some support but here  its all ranged and contains a lot of artillery supprt. The campaign is a little better than in the previous games because the enemy & allied nations are no longer idly passive. The multyplayer has undergone a welcoming change and contains a ranking system & achivements. One of the differences in the games is also that most nations units are the same and the differences between them are their stats, but this is no big problem.On the overall the game is a great step forward from the previous TW games & I recommend this game to every strategy game enthusiast.In the case that I have forgoten to mention anything or the articlle was too subjective please inform me and I will correct it.Thank you.

												Empire Total War is the continuation of the Total War franchise bringing it into the Napoleonic era of muskets and cannonballs and while Empire manages to maintain many of the good qualities from the series it brings very little new to the table and the ghosts of old flaws that's brought along makes it a very mixed experience.Rome Total War have become the benchmark by which the new Total War games are made. Almost every feature and design direction taken in Medieval 2 and Empire comes directly from Rome with no alterations or improvements made and while Rome was a great and innovative game the qualities that made it so are no longer unique to the Total War series and Empire suffers because of it.If you have somehow never played a Total War game before it can be explained fairly easily. You take command of a nation on a turn-based grand strategy map where you build up your cities and recruit armies. Eventually your enemies will meet up with the armies of other nations and you are thrown from the big strategic map into a real-time 3D tactical battle map where you have direct control of the units of your army as you try to defeat the enemy army.The strategic map has perhaps always been recognized as the greatest weak point in the Total War games and Empire continues this tradition. The turn-based model was never made with the same care as the turn-based games of old and this shows when a small army can walk past an army ten times it's size, conquering cities and raiding the countryside with impunity and still get far enough away that the larger army won't be able to catch up with it creating a sort of cat and mouse gameplay that does your enjoyment of the game no favors.Some improvements have been made over the previous games, most notably the introduction of a tech tree that, while still based on buildings in your various provinces, gives you a more open approach to customizing your nation. The diplomacy is as broken as ever and the AI still seems completely incapable of even the simplest tasks. The AI on the campaign map is so bad that if it wasn't for the ludicrous amount of cheating it does on the higher difficulties you would be winning every campaign in ten turns or less.The meat of the game and where Total War made it's name however is the battle map. Gone are the flaws of the campaign map and all that is left is glorious battle with thousands of soldiers at your command.The problem here however is one that has plagued the Total War series since it's beginning but is even more apparent now that it's made the jump into Napoleonic line combat. The AI is useless. It's not just that the AI is bad, it's that it cannot perform even the simplest of tasks which makes battles against it so trivial that it's almost painful at times. You would think that the developers would have discovered a way for the AI to maintain a formation beyond the first shot fired but every time it happens, the AI falls completely apart.The simplicity and limits of the game engine is also beginning to show as even though your soldiers are armed with musket and bayonet instead of sword and arrow now the battles still play out in much the same way as in previous games. This might be fine for a Rome or a Medieval 2 but Empire tries to emulate a very different age of war and it does not quite meet the standard of that era. Particularly if you've played the Take Command series of games you will begin to notice just how simple the tactical elements of the game have become.The battles are beautiful and your soldiers look impressive as they march forward in formation and the sounds are top quality.If someone who had never played a Total War game before asked me for a recommendation I'd tell him to get the newest one. Empire Total War might be a better game than Rome Total War but that is only a question of age. The Total War series used to be innovative, now they're just shallow repeats with little to look forward to.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Empire: Total War is a rather fun combination of real-time tactics and turn-based strategy. Overall the Fifth game of the Total War series, this was the first Total War game I have played, and I enjoyed it a great deal. I started off with the tutorial, which covers both ground unit real-time tactics, and naval warfare. Following this fast-paced, easy to use tutorial, I began playing from the Settlement of Jamestown. The learning curve was very easy with this game, and it was surprisingly fun for a turn-based game. Normally, I don't find these types of games enjoyable, but there was something about Empire: Total War that had me wanting to keep playing. Historical challenges are available, including several notable historic battles, The Battle of Brandywine Creek, Fontenoy, and so on. Conquest is the ultimate objective of the game and this can be done using not only military units, but Exploration, Trade, Politics, and founding other colonies. You have the option of playing almost a dozen different main factions. Campaigns allow you to play through American colonisation such as Establishing the colony of Jamestown, to the French and Indian conflict, and even the War for American Independence. I really enjoyed the historical aspect of this game, and also how it is part turn-based and part real-time strategy. I think Empire: Total War does a good job of weaving the two separate game styles together into a seamless whole. I think based off my enjoyment of this game, I may enjoy some of the other Total War titles as well.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Best strategy game of all time. Land and naval battles, managment is just near perfect. There are more than 10 playable fictions and all of them has unique army unit types, unique buildings and landmarks. Every fiction needs his own strategy and beware that if you dont make people happy you may be gilliotined :) I guarentee you enjoy or not strategic games after playing this game 2 hours you will love it. Game achieves main: Your choices change the world or world changes your choices and you feel that. Manegment is perfect, you must decide amount of taxes your regions pay. You must decide if you want be warrior or be diplomatic, trader,research technologies,  you must spread your religion.There are 3 continents : Full Europe half of Asia, America and bit of Africa. But most enjoyable is battle. Its just awesome controlling your troop and everything matters, if general is near them, if they saw their mates teared apart or even if they are running from uphill. Every segment of this game is awesome. There every details, forts castles naval battles (i dont enjoy it because it is not funny but everybody except me found it funny), diplomatic relations etc. But if you finish it single multiplayer will be waiting for you, and believe me it wont be easy as against computer. You can play naval and land battles or have long-period campaign with you or without your friends			",41,3,4,2,3,0,4

												A bold spin on the series which mostly pays off. Co-ordinating colonial era armies across Europe, The Americas, The Middle-East, and India is an impressive and breathtaking scope for the game! Commanding armies is a far more engaging and complex experience, with ranged units now the norm, adjusting established tactics from the previous games. Yet they are not distant, and combat is even more intense, with melee exchanges, cannon bombardments, and siege fixtures all in a day's battle!  Naval combat works well, and is a great change of pace! A significantly more intricate world map makes developing your provinces a much more mindful process, and the complexities of the enlightenment world mean you'll enjoy the tedium of empire running!  It is somewhat imbalanced, with the starting positions of each nation varying, meaning you'll have to play a certain way with each nation. It does greatly increase your interest in not only history, but politics, philosophy, religion, economics, and anthropology making it suprisingly educational! Well worth your time and money!

												Still alive and kicking as one of my favorite strategy game of all time. Albeit released in 2009, the game is not as smooth and polished as Napoleon Total War. There are small glitches here and there, but you sort of learn to work around them. Nothing game-breaking.Unfortunately, Creative Assemblies has yet to optimize the multiplayer experience. So a lot of games may drop, lag, have cheaters who don't follow rules, and just downright noobs who don't know what the'yre doing and there's not much player-side control over it. However, with its flaws, I still find the multiplayer to be much more balanced and enjoyable than Napoleon Total War. Granted I play native americans most of the time, I find that the factions have many different strengths & weaknesses, and the diversity of playing style and tactics are endless. It's also really fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥arrogant people off by beating them with mere Axes and Arrows. I also find the strategy to be much more in-depth than Napoleon. NTW just relies on stretching out lines, artillery barrages, and cavalry charges. In empire you have to be much more selective with how you form and move your infantry on the battlefield and which units to assign to different tasks. Are the expansions worth it? If you want to play online, definitely as it will keep you in equal balance with other players, although you can still win without them. For single player, not really, as downloading expansions like darthmod will give you tons of interesting added-on units.I don't have over 1500 hours in this game for nothing. Jump in and play. The learning curve is tough at first, but playing online is a good way to get good fast and blow through enemies both in singleplayer and multiplayer.			",35,0,0,0,1,0,6

												After 8 years of playing this and later Total War titles, this game, by my reflection, is like it's one of those classics in the franchise where you aren't really too blogged down into complicated politic machinations and leadership of your armies can be really interchangable as simply to click a button to recruit a General/Admiral without any having to go through your family tree or random event of Shogun to recruit a general to actually lead your men to battle. This game deserves a award to be one of the classical games ever created.Few of the great things that is missing from the later games have to be the fact you aren't allowed to simply research multiple topics at once when you have a few educational schools operational, 2 tax meter bars for both the middle class/nobility (who are responible for finance growth) and lower class pesanets (population growth) in different continents, able to build and upgrade roads at will (regarding Warhammer and Rome 2), and the ability to change your country's government type after angering 1 of 2 public classes.If this game ever get a number 2 game, I really hope they'll let us manipulate the family tree (Protestant, Catholic, many sons as Ottoman empire, or Maratha), a few different histortic figures that could be recruited as generals/admirals, could go a little more deeper within Africa and could play one of the few African factions as well as Asia, create a few more regions and factions for Europe threater, and the capability to erect a few more Region Capitals into the America as time go by.All in all, this game is pretty good if you happen to like the gunpowder era and different terrain types that change up your battle strartegy as well as to fight sea battles with your sail ship and more importantly.... simple faction management.

												In my opinion the best of the Total war games, i have spent hours on this game (don't be fooled by the counter, most of the time i was offline) just whittling down Europe into a new Swedish empire.I prefer this sort of gameplay to the more 'mainstream' ideas which Rome total war (1) and Medieval total war (both 1 and 2) often present in both campaign and battle. Though there is nothing better than watching a large mass of Line infantry firing in perfect sync at an enemy unit...10/10 would destroy Europe again.P.s, Ship battles in this are the best in all total war...

												One of the most flawed Total Wars but also one of the largest most ambitious ones. A new engine, full of bugs, a crippled new AI system and a poorly explained game. Time has fixed those issues and it's now the best running large scale Total War. To enjoy it you only really need to accept guns in your Total War. You can always fix your bayonets but never leave your guns at home.Fight and conquer across three theaters of war, the America's, Europe and Indian sub continent. Play with all the larger colonial powers, the (former) colonies and the warring Indian factions. Re-establish the Ottoman Empire or do make some oversea colonies for Prussia that it never had.It's a bit aged, lacks the fancy features you will find in Rome 2 and the AI still has some glitches but a lot can be modded out and overal it's way better then Rome 2, larger scale then Napoleon and more diverse then Shogun 2.

												As someone who has been traditionally partial to medieval armour, weapons, and aesthetic, I originally didn't think style of warfare in the early modern period or the ""Black Powder"" style of warfare prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries was particularly fascinating and appealing. This was largely due to the inaccurate portrayal of the grim realities of warfare in contemporary period works at the time. however, as a history major who became acquainted with enthusiasts, connoiseurs, and aficionados of this style of warfare. it was their presence which inspired me to take the time to learn about the politics, warfare, society, and culture of the 17th and 18th centuries. it was through my studies that I came to understand how intense the aesthetic and experience of warfare was during the early modern period of european history. most artistic interpretations by the period of warfare's contemporaries as well as much of our modern interpretations of this style of warfare in both games and films make little effort in the way of expressing the visual, physical, and emotional brutality and intenseness that many young men and seasoned veterans had to face in the early modern period. advancements in military technology such as those made in firearms and artillery transformed the face of warfare forever as opposed to the melee and armourcentric style of warfare that happened in the middle ages and the renaissance. Thus, with these new technological advancements came new, and might i argue, scarier and more visceral kinds of human cruelties and brutalities that made fighting and killing far in excess of the limits of the raw powers of the human body. The human element of warfare was also highly elevated in response to these new evolutions in the nature of warfare. with the advent of military drill and training, the physical and mental fitness and discipline of the soldiers of this period were arguably superior to the serjents, men at arms, archers, and crossbowmen who peopled the infantry of the medieval era. with the exception of the aristocratic knights who were trained from birth to be expert killers and equipped with the finest weapons, armour, and mounts. medieval infantry to the best of scholarly observation and research were fairely weaker and undiscplined in contrast to the line infantry and footmen of the early modern period, who were typically organized into a line of battle and were expected to depend on discipline and sheer individual courage to hold the line of battle in the face of opposing firepower. However, the novelty that I came to appreciate most about the warfare and military aesthetic of this time period was the surprising amount of melee and close combat that was used in this battle, with the development of the lighter, more efficient flintlock muskets and the extinction of renaissance ""Pike and Shot"" formations in favour of the plug bayonets and their later innovations. regiments of line infantry would often resort to close combat or melee, which would remain strategically and tactically sound both as a means to save ammunition and fight on terrain where ""The lne of fire"" would be a strategically unfeasable means to fight an opponent, such as the narrow corridors of an urban settlement, strategic bottlenecks like the crossing of a bridge or the breach of a fortress, or even certain narrow and uneven terrain where froming a line of attack would be impossible due to the strategic limitations of the terrain. The other occasion where close combat and melee would also remain in a position of strategic and tactical importance in this age of warfare would be through the use of cavalry. while black powder warfare would influence the strategic and tactical use of cavalry with smaller firearms such as carbines and pistols, close combat cavalry charges with ""cold steel"" such as sabres and lances would continue to be the weapons and tactics of choice for many, if not most generals in the 17th and 18th centuries. This understanding of the strategic and tactical importance of close combat and melee in early modern warfare would be enough to spark my enthusiasm for both the warfare and history of this time period. however, in coming to understand the aesthetic innacuracies of modern portrayals of medieval soldiers and warriors. i have come to realize that the rise of standard issue military uniforms is a novelty of early modern european warfare in this time period. and thus, military attire of this period was both aesthetically superior to all its predecessors from the medieval and classical periods, and would remain the alltime epitome and gold standard of military attire that would serve as the foundation and inspiration of later forms of military uniform.Lastly, Through my personal understanding of the military expoits of the French Emperor and General Napoleon Bonaparte and his experiences leading french armies during the revolutionary and napoleonic wars. I have come to believe, taking into consideration napoleon's love for classical greek and roman military history as well as his mathematical expertise in understanding the nature of probability and calculated, strategic planning. That the individual tactics and overall military strategy of the black powder warfare of the 17th and 18th centuries centuries are largely inspired by scholarly research and understanding of military warfare as practiced by the ancient greeks and romans. The rennaissance, or the beginning of the early modern period in the 15th century was marked by an intense fascination and study of classical texts from ancient greece and rome. while originally preserved and interpreted by the literati of the roman catholic church, a growing secular interest and interpreation of these ancient texts was beginning to take prominence amongst the scholarly community of the renaissance onwards which would affect and improve all manner of life and society, and warfare and combat were no exceptions from this advancements made in the study of these antiquated texts. the organization, structure, tactics, and strategic docrines of the black powder warfare the 17th and 18th century were arguably inspired by scholarly research and interpration of greek and roman military treatises and manuscripts as well as the personal military exploits by classical greek and roman generals like Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Leonidas. Both the Impact and influence such texts would have on the developments of early modern warfare would be epitomized in Napoleon's battles such as rigoli, austerlitz, and liepzig, and toulon where application of the principles behind Spartan, Macedonian, and Roman military tactics would would result in triumph for napoleon and the french empire that would result in france being the first european country to dominate europe since ancient rome. Due to the multitude and the genius of napoleon's many military victories, his battles and military exploits would continue to be studied in the presitigious setting of military academies to this very day, and the accounts of napoleons military triumphs and those of generals like him, as well as the treastises and manuscripts by military theorists of the time such as carl von clausewitz would serve as the foundational material for which all aspiring military officers to this very day continue to study as a means of developing a knowledge base for military thinking.In conclusion to all my points. My studies of the politics, warfare, and military theory of the early modern period have opened me to chossing this game as my alltime favourite total war game. even moreso than medieval II total war, my traditional favourite of which I have spent 2000 or so hours on. For all of you who enjoy swords, armour, and melee, and hack and slash style rpg and action games, I wouldn't recommend this game to you unless you have the openness and curiousity to learn about and appreciate the political and military history of this time period.

												Note: I only run one mod! It sort of alters my review.. for the better IMHO! Well anyway, its more-or-less a community patch that fixes many complained about aspects of the vannila version and tweaks certain gameplay mechanics for the better. It also alters some minor campain cosmetics, and adds a TON of very usefull, realistic different units which add to each faction's uniqueness even more! The mod is called DarthMod Empire 8.1 and I totally recomend it as well!Now... the review:Before Steam, I played the vanilla version for well over 300 hours, 99% singleplayer. For whatever reasons Total War MP doesn't do it for me like say.. Age of Empires 2 MP does.This is my favourite game out of the Total War series, often taking the spot as my favourite strategy game in general. I love the scale of it all. One can really get satisfied by upgrading and fighting for your distant colonies! This game is HUGE! Playing the ""Grand Campain"" on ""World Domination"" mode may take 10+ hours to fully complete. The sea battles are hard, but very fun! Managing an armada is quite a task, hopefully you've done the proper research! The race against other faction's scientific clocks is on, as Empire lets one build schools and send schollarly gentlemen to research new technology!If you're a fan of previous Total Wars, you might be overwhelmed with all the new features and mechanics, but TRUST ME it will grow on you!If this is your first Total War game, you're in for one heck of an experience as well!Once you see the whole mini-map one solid color, and that color is your factions color, you will share the same satisfaction I have gotten many a time from Empire!

												This game has a special place in my heart, because it is the game that really got me into the Total War series.  The main thing I like about this game, is the campain map.  technically, this map doesn't have the most settlements in the entire series, but it has the biggest map in any of the games.  You can conquer India, North America and the tip of South America, Carribeans, and Europe.  This gives it a more important feel and that your actions effect more people.  I also love the variation of units for each faction.  The american army had better skrimishers than the English, but the English's line infantry were more regimented and didn't break as easly.  I also love the audio for this game.  I would find myself scrolling up to a single unit and just listening to how well in sounded when he shot his musket.  This is also the first in the series to introduce naval battles that you can play which look beutiful, but can be confusing.  The bad part is that the A.I in this game is some of the worst I have ever seen.  Half the time, they don't even move, and the other half, they just charge at you with no strategy whatsoever.  To sum it up, this game is set in my favorite time period, and besides the cluncy AI, this game does the time period justice.			",216,31,5,7,28,1,34

												It's hard to make a decisive yes or no recommendation for Empire: Total War.On one hand, it's one of the glitchiest games in a series infamous for it's bugs. At it's worst, units refuse to move, stop to reform into positions you didn't tell them to, or sometimes even refuse to fire altogether. Thankfully, glitches of this magnitude are rare, but can sometimes be bad enough to cause you to lose battles because your units simply don't follow orders.On the other hand, it's the largest Total War game. You can create colonies in, and be actively engaging in wars, across three different continents- Europe, Asia (both Asia Minor and India), and America. There's less faction variety between groups of the same continent (for example, European armies are very similar), but the variety comes in when an army of one continent engages the forces of another. Europeans, Ottomans, Indians, and Native Americans all fight differently.As well, Empire takes place in a hugely underrepresented time period. Very few games take place in the 1700's, and Empire does a great job of representing musket warfare. Combat is slower-paced than games like Rome or Shogun 2, and tactics are focused on gaining artillery advantage.I end by recommending the game, since I enjoyed it, but your enjoyment depends strongly on your interest in the time period, and your tolerance to bugs.

												In 1706, I, leader of Russia, conquered Crimea with General Ivan Mazepa leading my troops into battle.In 1707, the Crimean people rose up and overthrew the garrison I placed in their lands.In 1708, with Prince Anikita Repnin leading a second army while General Mazepa was tied up in Dagestan, I marched against them and besieged their holdings in Bakchisaray. Rather than give up without a fight, their forces left the city and attacked my army. I placed my troops on a sloping hill nearby, entrenching my infantry and cannons while my cavalry lay in wait at the crest, ready to charge. I had over 1900 battle-hardened troops at my disposal, veterans, all. They had over 2000, but were mostly comprised of peasant militia, with only a single troop of cavalry with their leader. With the elevated and fortified position at my disposal, I waited for their army to cross the valley below. Their leader rode out ahead of their infantry to scope out the battlefield. As soon as he saw what was waiting for him and his men, he turned and ran all the way back to the city, without so much as a word to his infantry, who kept marching up the hill in the face of artillery barrage from my cannons. By the time the Crimean army reached the top of the hill, two of their regiments were already routed, peppered by my infantry's guns after they were too close for effective bombardment. After 5 regiments of my cavalry charged along their flank, their forces were shattered completely and routed.By the end, over 75% of their forces were dead on the field, with less than 25% of my own joining them, most of whom were merely injured and would live to fight another day.Empire: Total War called this a ""Heroic Victory"". It did not feel heroic. Perhaps granting them a period of tax exemption will take the edge off…			",298,109,3,56,31,4,52

												Empire: Total War.This game is, beyond a doubt, one of the most uninspiring games of the Total War series that I have had the pleasure of playing.  It has so many bugs, you'd think of calling your local pest control.  The portraits for the characters in the game are..lackluster.  They didn't even bother to give the people in the portraits a background, at least in my experience with the game.  The Battle AI is absolutely random, having some brilliant moments of high-stakes deployment, but other times losing a battle they should clearly win.  I myself survived a nasty battle, playing as Sweden.  I had four regiments of line infantry, and was attacked by nearly a stack of Austrian militia and line infantry, yet I still won because the Austrian soldiers actually refused to press forward and engage me.That last bit is the heart of the issue; this game, as incredible as the potential was for a world-wide, 18th century-based game, it is seriously undercut by the odd decisions that were undertaken. For example, I don't know who's idea it was to make every single siege battle on a city with walls look identical, but that was lazy work.  Even as far back as Rome: Total War, cities had varying shapes and sizes to their walls.  Yet things are identical, here, in the 18th century?  A time marked by decidedly huge differences in everything from one cities' religious tolerance, to troops per unit, to the ideals of the local monarch?  Creative Assembly, please.  We would rather you take longer and give us a better experience, than to hurry up and weaken the magic of your earlier works.But, you may be reading this, and seeing that I still recommend this game.  Why is that?Because this game does many things very well indeed.  When at 'ultra' settings, this game is very, very beautiful.  Crisp uniforms, detailed smoke clouds from mass musket volley fire, the reflective water on the campaign map.  I find it all very much a step into a new era of Total War.  And the audio is impressive, as well.  The sound of hundreds of men running and shouting in combat, the sound of cannon barrages firing and then the thumping clash of the shells landing upon the enemy, the officers' barking orders, to which a drum plays the command to the men.  As a fan of history, I can't help but find myself fully immersed in the sounds of the battle, despite the lackluster AI ability.There is, however, a much larger reason to play this game.  A reason that fits nearly every single game since 2000.  What am I talking about? Modifications.The community for this game have made hundreds, if not THOUSANDS, of modifications for this game, ranging from changing the accuracy of the men in each regiment, to a complete and total overhaul of the game...including ridding the game of most of the issues that it was saddled with upon its release.So yes, this game is far from perfect.  It does have many issues.  But, in the end, I will gladly recommend this game to any fan of historical affectations, or even simply those of a curious mindset.  Because despite this game not being perfect, it brings enough to the table to keep those that are willing to work through the issues entertained. ",23,1,0,1,5,2,3

												Spoiler Free Review:I always write that first bit, not wanting to ruin the game for someone, but this time it's funny cause seriously, it's history...Anyway, Empire: Total War is pretty old at this point, Rome: Total War II being out, but I'm finally hitting this one up for achievments and having played a few quick games, I quickly was drawn back into the gameplay and time period.  Like all Total War games, you'll spend most of your time on the battle map and the campaign map.  The battles themselves are quite engaging.  Other reviews have complained about the AI, I suggest they bump up the difficulty level.  The AI is dynamic, and when playing multiplayer vs the AI you can set up several different scenarios to test the Napolean in you. The campaign map often gets cluttered and is hard to manage in late game once you actually have money to spend.  The main con for me on this one was the frustrating arrangement of assasins, clerics and gentleman, the when they have it organized and being able to access them every turn was just a frustrating experience compared to more modern Total War games.Recommendation:Release date: 9 out of 10Now - 1/2017: 6 out of 10 - but, still worth playing if you like Total War games.Played on: i7-6700, 16gb Ram, GTX 1070			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game with unlimited re-playability. Graphics are very good. Technological advances make a huge difference. Real time battles are easy to control and strategy oriented as opposed to a huge brawl. Naval battles are good as well as important cosidering the florins to be made by controlling the trade routes. Three continents to conquer as well as the trade areas offers a huge world. Downside is AI is still not too bright but it can still beat you if you push into enemy territory too deep ,too fast.AI is not totally incompetent though, build up an area and leave it unprotected and someone may decide to invade no matter how far behind the lines, enjoying your previous money making territory as their own.Yes, seaborne invasions of England do occur .Over 1200 hours and still enjoy this game .Maybe i just enjoy the warfare of this era .Never trust the Maratha Confederacy.

The battles are amazing even though some people say Napoleon Total War is better, I will say that THIS game is 10x better just because of the sheer grasp of the amount of land there is to explore! From Europe, down into Ottoman controlled Middle East, to India, and finally the Americas. Packed with lots of different factions there is always the ability to be at war or be at peace depending on the type of country you choose to be.

												With the Release of Empire, real modding has been disallowed and locked outside of tweaking a few stats.  However, the game itself is very playable if it becomes a bit monotonous as you move outward building your Empire.  The Battle AI could do with reading the Art of War, but it is acceptable and formations do mostly hold up though there is little real opportunity for real battle tactics against the mob the AI throws at you as you can form, sit, wait, and destroy the enemy as they attack too easily as they use no guile or formation past the opening moves.

												I probably should have recommended and reviewed this game a long time ago... Apart from Civ 3 or Dark Riegn, both of which I played back in the early 2000's, Empire: Total War has been my most played game strategy game and one of my most played games of all time. I love the real time battles in the Total War games. I recomment Empire to anyone that likes strategy games or has played any of the other Total War games. I even like it more than Rome II that just came out before my writing of this review.			",27,2,0,7,10,0,12

												This game right here, is probably one of my favorite Total Wars out there. From fighting in the Americas to the coasts of India this game is never ending action! The battles are amazing even though some people say Napoleon Total War is better, I will say that THIS game is 10x better just because of the sheer grasp of the amount of land there is to explore! From Europe, down into Ottoman controlled Middle East, to India, and finally the Americas. Packed with lots of different factions there is always the ability to be at war or be at peace depending on the type of country you choose to be. The unlimited amount of gameplay is amazing adding hours upon hours of time to spend on this game! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Campaign can make your head explode, especially if you're an Empire such as Great Britain that has settlements in America and interests in places such as India. (I couldn't care less if my vassal is getting attacked, it will take a million turns to get there to help!!!)YOU'RE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL. The battles are good, I prefer to kill unarmed units with a line of musketmen and the Road to Independence mode allows you to do just that. Worth a play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: Many many more hours played than recorded on Steam, for a long time I played this without an internet connection.There is simply no game that compares with this one for me, and is the second greatest game ever released by the Creative Assembly. The campaign is epic and the scope is truly global, and represents the times and strategies of the day better than any other game.No franchise has given me as many hours of enjoyment as the Total War series, and this one is my favorite after Medieval 2. Now that the kinks are worked out, no game can compare.10/10 for all your line of battle needs.			",103,19,0,32,27,0,47

												This game is good, but you can really get destroyed early game if you go the wrong country. I recommend going the Netherlands (United provinces) because they have territory in all 3 theatres. The game can be super hard at first, having people declare war on you, bad tech advances, etc. But as the game progresses, you will usually find yourself doing better and better.  The battles are amazing, but the naval battles can be frustrating to get ahold of. If you like games like Sid meirs colonization, or really any RTS game set in that era, you will love this game.

												If you like stategy game amd/or the 18th centry warfare? This game is perfect. Apart from some graphical issues and on easy or normal (which all the people who say the game's AI is horrible seem to play on) the AI is just about as good as a 3 year old child.  Apart from that, the game offers over 10 diffrent nations to play as (each with their own starting areas, and unique troops)  real time battles, naval battles, send trade ships to go get you  trading goods to make a big profit from, and if i was to name all the reasons this game was great, the list would never end.Some of my favorite features are liberate nations(learn how to do by guides or the internet) and get protectorates, and wars of sucsession (which are normal wars but when you leader dies this is most likely to happen).  Troops range from militia to the elite british cold stream guards or provencial cavalry (militia cavalry pretty much) to the polish winged hussars and even demi cannons (stationary, low firepower artillery) to mortars, howizters, normal cannons, to low firepower but mobile horse artillery. Or maybe want to be ahead of the other nations techonoligy wise? Build schools and colleges and send gentlemen theri to reaserch military tech, infantry like bayonets,0rtillery for better cannons and better amunition, or naval for better ships, speed and less chances of misfires. Industrail for your better building that get you alot of money, like ironworks, or to make you get even more money from them. And finaly is, enlightment technolegy. This is for getting better schools to reaserch faster, do research faster, better tax income, better trade and even some trade ports.Hope this helped if you want to know the very basics of this game (it is some what complex but it is still easy to learn			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is epic and is way better than all other stategy games that I have ever played. The possibilities in what to do with your ever expanding empire are many; you can either try stay true to how history really was or utterly change it, depending on your desire. Of course the AI doesn’t follow the book so you’ll always see the Indian nations trying to form a colony in America or even claim Europe as their own. Every action you do will affect how other nations think of you, so you can't just use trickery on other nations and expect everyone else to think nothing of it. You must have the face of a gentleman and the mind of a warrior to succeed.The cons of this game is that there should be more to the diplomatic side, not a simple case of ""give me 20,000 coins and I will make peace."" I'd like there to more structure and an ability to properly formulate treaties that result in the loser giving annual payments to the victor after a war etc. There should also be the option to lend out units to allies and they should be much more effective, instead of just having armies doing nothing they actually invade and provide support to the player. Finally, I feel that it conquering a region shouldn't be a case of simply taking the regional capital, the fact that armies can raid factories and farms etc, as well as occupy them, it should give the option for that nation to incorportate this into their own empire, therefore reducing the size of the region that lost these buildings and also providing more tactical gain. It would make conquering regions much more realistic in my opinion. I've not played all of the Total War games but from what I have played, I feel that these cons stretch across the whole series and not just Empire: Total War.9/10			",25,0,0,1,9,0,6

												The british navy is the most famous and languished naval power in history. It has boasted such military victories as Trafalgar, and has been attributed with inventing many of the military ideals most modern navies still use today. Their crews are well trained and proud.

												Awesome game totally worth the twenty dollars! The only think I don't like; when you have elite line infantry they fire in little sections that take forever to get done, and when they're getting charged they don't fire a volley they keep firing that stupid little three man ripple fire. I wish that was changed to bigger sections, more like a 9 man ripple fire; or at least when they get charged they fire a whole volley. But overall, a fantastic game!! 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far the most realistic combat I have seen in a video game that is based around this era. The strategy, skill, adaptiveness, and flexibility required to skillfully achieve victory in this game, per battle or per campaign, is genuinely unlike anything I've seen before. A 9/10 must own for any moderately skilled strategist. My only regret is that the Grand Campaign is not available for multiplayer, for I would like nothing more than to have my companions march a campaign by my side. Besides that, I believe this game, though somewhat dated in graphics by today's standards, Is worth a try for strategy gamers everywhere.			",109,14,0,11,25,0,35

												I've really enjoyed playing Empire: Total War.It has the perfect balance between detail and size. Medieval II: Total War, for instance, has so much detail it's hard to look at.But Empire is in that happy zone of size versus detail. It has great replay value, because of the level of gameplay details. At the same time, it doesn't get bogged down by virtue of being too detailed. This keeps the gameplay moving. I find it particularly refreshing in a Total War title, since I love playing them but get tired of the later-game level of nation management. In short, it doesn't drag you down with administrative tasks as the game gets into the later stages. You can keep conquering enemy nations, instead of keeping your nation afloat with never-ending building management, like in the original Medieval: Total War.The level of advice in the game is perfect for newbies, or for players returning after a long hiatus. It really holds your hand and shows you the ropes, all without being too intrusive. After you've wrung all you can from the advice, you can turn it down or off.The new battle mechanics of using largely gunpowder troops is a switch for Total War. Of course, previous titles were dominated by hand-to-hand combat with pikes, swords, and the like. Lining up blocks of infanty, by contrast, may get boring after a while since it has less detail. But that depends on the type of player you are.Instead of concentrating all of a province's buildings in the region capital, there are now buildings spread throughout the province. For instance, farms, universities, and industrial buildings are spread throughout the province. This makes the game more interesting to look at, since it isn't a meaningless landscape dotted with region capitals. It also gives an added stragegic element to the game: you can pillage these buildings, and thus remove the benefits they provide the other nation. For instance, you can pillage a university and thus take it out of action. It then can't do research for the nation you're fighting. These buildings can be repaired for cash in one turn. But still it puts a monkey wrench in the works, especially if it's an advanced building which is expensive to repair.The different strategic regions (Europe, The New World, India) feel very balanced. It's especially fun to be fighting in North America around the time range of the American Revolution. India feels very boring, since it's basically an inverted triangle. But still, it has a meaningful level of detail to it. It doesn't just feel like a sideshow, though you can ignore it if you wish.I like that you can send trading ships, called Indiamen, to different places in the world to bring back valuable resources. So for instance, you can dispatch an Indiaman to the west coast of Africa to bring back ivory for your nation to sell to other nations. It's a good source of income, and I like the reliability and simplicity of it. It's a very nice touch.Diplomacy has a good deal of detail. For instance, if you're allied to a nation, break your alliance with it and then attack it, you'll get a permanent negative rating with most of the nations of the world. They don't like treaty violators! It makes them think twice about engaging in any deals with you. So be careful who you ally with. Don't do it as a convenience which you intend to break 10 turns later. Additionally, there are ""historical grievances"" between different nations based on their actual history. So for instance, the United Provinces have historical grievances with Spain because of Spain's attempts to conquer the nation. It adds a nice amount of...landscape to diplomacy. It doesn't feel like you're all just a bunch of random nations dumped into an Earth-like arena with no background. It feels more like actual history.Unfortunately, you can't play as the United States. I guess they thought that it would be impossible to make it into a meaningful power with any realism. Still, it would have been nice to try! So if you would like to have a part in American history, it will have to be secondary part. For instance, in my first campaign I was playing as Prussia and conquered Britain. This sparked the American Revolution by eliminating the Original Thirteen's rulers across the sea. So you can be involved, but only in a secondary way.So if you like Total War games, and especially if you'd like one that moves a little faster than previous titles, give Empire: Total War a whirl!

												Empire TW has the bad wrap that it has a terrible AI. While in a later, sort of patched mode, Empire total war is still an amazing game without any mods at all. People blame Empire for all bad things, but when it comes down to it, Empire TW was the first game with a new battle engine that really had the capability to capture all the glory and death in Europe during the 18th CenturyAD. One of the best parts about it, is the Road to Independence Campaign, or the ""America"" campaign where you begin as the British in the ""New World"", and move to rising up and furthering the greatness of the American Republic. Empire TW is truly a great game for those who enjoy American history, and the 18th Century.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Conquer! Conquer! Conquer! That's the only reason why I love Total War games! I am very fond of this one in particular due to the size of the campaign map. The use of rifles and mortars is also quite a fun addition! Ship battles can also be easily won if you have the right ship and keep your distance. Generally setting other ships on fire is the best way to scare away the enemy fleet!			",196,34,1,10,37,0,35

												Empire Total War is a great choice if you have an itch for Age of Sail/Gunpowder Era game play. For those of you whom may never have played a Total War title this next part is for you. Total War games are a mixture of 2 common Strategy Game mechanics. You have a campaign board and you have a RTS Battle Mode. For the camapign board think Sid Meyer's Civilization, you control the empires finances, build queues and unit movements in this mode. When you go to fight an enemy force you then go into a RTS mode where the armies involved fight on a map that represents your location on the campaign board. Example, if your forces engage the enemy in a forest then expect the battle mode map to be a forest. If you attack an enemy that is blocking bridge access to the other side on the campaign board you will have to fight accross that bridge in the battle mode map if you want to win. The opposite is true if you are defending. You can choose to automate nearly everything in this game, wether it be taxes, building queues or even land and sea battles. This makes it somewhat easier to learn the ropes of the game as it can be a bit overwhelming at first but I would suggest going straight for the deep end and learn how to do it all yourself.Graphically the game looks great with maxed settings.Audio seems legit most of time but every now and again i notice that some sounds vanish only to return later just as quickly as they left.Quick note on pacing in the game, if you are new or just havent played in a while it can seem slow to start and in some ways it truly is. Trust that patience is a virtue in the early game because when the shiiyat hits the fan it will test you.All in all i think Empire Total War is a great game and can certainly offer you many hours of enjoyment. I recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games and wants a colonial era setting in which to strategize.10/10 would handle the American Revolution properly again10/10 would watch thousands and angry axe wielding natives vanish in a charge on my lines again			",38,2,0,13,6,0,9

												I LOVE THIS GAME. My top two favorite games are Skyrim and Empire: Total War. That moment when your general who has conquered most of Europe and finally dies is heartbreaking, and you may shed a few tears. However, when you meet a nation's most powerful army in the field and this battle will decide that fate of your enemy, nothing is as satisfying as seeing their entire army rout, pursued by your own loyal soldiers. Or when two large fleets partake in a fleet action, and you blow up several enemy ships, capture a few, and sink the rest, you truly feel like a genuine imperialist. Nothing could be more satisfying. Buy this game and give in to your imperialist desires.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ship and land battles are well detailed, and mods make the game even more immersive.  I still load it up and play a land battle from time to time when the mood strikes.  If you see this on super bargain clearance and say to yourself, I want to fight the revolutionary war, or fight the evil Russian monarchy with Sweden, then hey, you just bought this game.

												To somebody who loves the classic Total War games, this game is crap. To anybody else, this game has a great campaign which combines your skills in grand strategy and real-time battles. If you love the crackling sounds of muskets and the roar of a cavalry charge, you might be interested in this game. No historical uniforms though. Naval combat is kind of bad too. Also, if you're interested in getting either Napoleon: Total War or Empire: Total War, take this information into account. If you like campaigns, get Empire. If you like battles, get Napoleon. Also keep in mind that Empire's graphics are lackluster, while Napoleon has historically accurate uniforms and arguably the second best graphics in the Total War series (Attila: Total War probably is the best for me).Or you can be a money scrub like me and buy both Napoleon and Empire.

												I am an American, and purchased this while living in Europe. I have spent hours upon hours lost in this game world. It was for me such an amazing experience - my introduction to Steam, the introduction of sea battles in the Total War franchise, the historical period.  It was a step down in some aspects - the ""clone"" armies vs the unique variations in Medieval II (my favorite Total War to date), the bugs at launch, but the sheer scope and size of it all is absolutely fan-f-ing-tastic. This Total War was the first one that really gave me the feeling of being in control of an alternate history; the leader of a world power. One of the things that I miss a bit was the length of the battles. It's sad to go into a game of the wonderful Attila, such a step up from Rome II (which almost brought me to tears at launch it was so disappointing), and have two massive armies decimate each other in 10 minutes. I played Empire last night, 2v2, and the battle lasted 45 minutes. Half-way through the battle my teammate and I were winning, and then the French overpowered my overly aggressive enemy without me noticing while I defended against the Cherokee, and in the last 10 minutes our enemies completely overcame us. Such a lengthy, brutal battle is typical in Empire, while most confrontations in Rome II and Attila seem like 10-minute-long skirmishes. +1 for Empire: TW. Sieges too were a bit disappointing with focus on forts vs towns, but the towns you do get to fight in usually make for exciting urban combat situations. Overall, not my favorite Total War, but heads-and-shoulders above anything else out there for this time period. Thank you Creative Assembly - you're not perfect, but your games have been my favorite for over a decade.			",29,7,0,13,15,0,27

												I think i reviewed this game shortly years ago so it's time to re-iterate when it's 100% sure no patches are coming. Stay away. Unless 1) you get this very very cheaply. 2) and you have a zen-state mind where you just accept the the fact that 'you hit caca and caca does not hit you'. You need to loose all hope to begin with. Frustration leads to anger, anger leads to... well you know. Prepare to constantly save and have a huge library of saves as sometimes without any warning 1-3 of your latest saves just becomes corrupted so you need to go back quite some time to be able to resume your game. Sometimes losing 5-10minutes of progress is a lot. And before trying any mid-to-large sized battles you must exit the game and restart it just to ensure you have max memory available as the leaking kills the game soon. (4gb 32-bit win 7 here but according to forums it does not matter much)Automatic quality settings is a must - not because of FPS - no no thats so pleb. for this game AQ is a defensive measure against crashes. Oh yeah, want to know what my secret sauce for getting both this game and Shogun 2 to work better when it's time to 'get real' and fight a big battle? put gfx settings to lowest. You MIGHT actualy be able to complete the game + save it (without corruption). It does not hurt though to have the will to play the same battle 2-5 times if it crashes. Cheers. and here i just laugh at the idea of buying Rome 2. Never going to happen with any games based on this engine. And to all of those people who have never been hit with these problems: good for you, the sun light shines on you but i don't want to know anything about that. I just don't. TW support  forums, the official and the unofficial ones are places where hope of getting things fixed goes to die.   I love this game to bits as can be seen by the hours clocked on it but playing it sure requires nerves of steel. I have never gotten even close to completing a short game. NOT EVEN CLOSE.

												Well... I may say give an 7.4 Rating on 10. __________________________                                                                                                                          -Basic Introduction- ( And Moments )__________________________A game set in ol' 1700's. The Developers made a good pavement to reach for this, but it has bumps.To be honest the game is really slow to load especially when you buy it, but after time it gets better; in fact it loads in like 2-3 minutes after that. I made a battle in *Road to Independance* , Took one hell of a long time to load -.- so I just had to restart my computer, I know when the numbers are big you have to wait but come on! I lost my patience after 15 minutes. Another flaw is that when I was using my Riflemen to put Stakes in front of my Puckle Guns... Oh! -.- This I hate very much and stupid *Glitch* They turned around took a couple of paces and planted them... facing my dragoons! And away from the Indian cavalry, long story-short I got F***ed ... SO that really sucked xD  Good side is that they have good detail ( Troops, Forts, Seperate Nations, Cannons, and Cavalry, how the Country's are geographically accurate *Mapping* and also Accents =D ) . Sea Battles are cool, got incredible detail, Hilarius when you see the enemy ship blow up xD not so much when it's a Heavy First Rate xD . __________________________                                                                     -Campaigns-__________________________Nice Achievments but sometimes in the Main Campaign they are kinda *twisted*. I mean World Domination is conquering 40 citites? ( Hardest Right?) Short-Long Campaign- Capture 15-25 Cities... Now xD don't tell me this...When in World Domination Prussia needs Brandenburg ( Its own Capital so no prob right? =D ) England Short-Long, well capture Malta ( My own Country =D Some place in India, Merika, have to go to War with em' Ottomans; so Total War right?)I don't know :P__________________________                                                                      -Diplomacy-__________________________Small flaws when it comes to Diplomacy and I'm not alone -.- Ok so ex. I tell France that I want one of their technology in exchange for 3 of mine, They say no... REALLY? no???!!!ok so what am I to do?- Nothing. After some time when you are at war, they offer peace after no war acts happen (Battles) or either just don't quit on the war.. heh :P . In Medieval Total War they have that - Balanced, Generous or Demanding - Note to help set things *equal* when you are at Diplomacy. They could've made that would really help a lot =D---Sometimes the smaller Nations offer you to become their Protector, so yaya! __________________________                                                               -In game Battle ( Land )-__________________________Not anything bad or anything but it sucks that you can't see the FULL VIEW, I mean when you zoom-out, you see part of your army. When you zoom in close it lags so you can't see the *Full Action* =D                                                                 +++++++++++++++++Got a nice N-Zoom, makes you look like you are part of that Battle =D +++Pulls a neat Square Formation for  the Infantry +++Nice Diamond and Wedge Formation for Cavalry+++Neat Graphics for its level+++And nice in-game Commands =D+++Uniforms are played nice+++__________________________                                                                     -Sea Battles-__________________________Very neat Graphics especially for its level =D+++Good use of *Wind* can lead to Victory making it more lively.+++Can turn anybattle to a win.

												Empire Total War is a strategy game like I've never laid eyes on before. It has a brilliant mix between the turn based campaign that leads directly into real time battles. For every unit you can change their rank and file accordingly, change formations, even tell them to skirmish or fire and advance. The game can get repetitive if you don't challenge yourself though so I do recommend leaving normal difficulty as soon as you feel comfortable with the mechanics. Other than that the campaigns are varied with different units you can choose from for each category from elite infantry all the way to morter batteries. I highly recommend both this game and it's successor, Napoleon Total War. I will comment though that Napoleon is not NEARLY as varied when it comes to factions, and is a little lacking in the campaign department. It's a decent expansion though.			",94,4,0,2,8,0,15

												This is a great entry into the total war franchise. - - - - pros - very balanced - good unit variety- deep strategic possibility s - easy to learn hard to master - - - - cons -very rock paper scissors when you go unit to unit -  laggy online - no longer has a bustling player base - units moral seems really fragile  - - - -wishes - steam mod support This game takes place in the colonial era. So guns play a rather large role in this, and because of the era the guns are mostly single shot muzzle loaders. There are also melee infantry, hoursemen (both armed with fire arms and melee weapons) , and artillery of varying caliber. Landscape is very important in this game because of the surplus of ranged units. Hight as in most games will help your ranged units and slow the advance of melee infantry. Artillery is also helped by being put on hills and the like.In all honesty melee is not as important in this game as in others. But melee troops are still very useful. Because most units are ranged a melee unit can very quickly destroy their moral or the unit in general. But this goes the same both ways because of the ranged unit being well ranged. So melee are best for ambushes or holding walls.One of the cons i mentioned above is that moral seems really fragile. Units can brake in a mater of SECONDS. This would be ok if it was mere cannon fodder but even the most elite of units can be broken after one or two volleys of fire then at other times they charge though no problem. The moral system seems unstable and inconstant.  -1 point As mentioned above all the factions are relatively balance because they share alot of units with small changes. The only faction that is at both a disadvantage and an advantage is the Indian nations. Because they are over all more stealthy they are good for ambushes, they also have better melee units from the start of the game, but their range is a lot lower then the European nations.The online is very laggy if more then two players are involved. This is rather common in total war games. So unless playing 1 on 1 online or playing though LAN i would recommend not putting your hopes into online -.5 pointsA small complaint i also have is the lack of online campaign. Many other total war games both before and after have this feature.As mentioned above the unit to unit comparison is very rock paper scissors. But many strategy games are like this and with proper strategy and high ground advantage it can be changed.so because you can counter it I think it evens out.so over all i think it is a 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've tried to justify this game in my head so many times, but I've reached my limit; Empire: Total War is complete garbage. There's a fantastic game hidden deep beneath the countless bugs, but these bugs are so game-ruining that even after six years Empire feels like it's unfinished and still in development. The A.I is ridiculously poor, during sieges the infantry refuse to shoot, or cannons knock down their own walls, and if the computer is the attacking faction the game seems to know that the A.I won't be able to attack on its own, so it cheats. I've started sieges with sections of my walls already knocked down, and sometimes the enemy need only come into close proximity of my gates for the computer to unlock them for the A.I. More often than not the infantry units simply walk around the map, allowing themselves to be killed or routed. I've installed one or two mods to help with the A.I, which has improved it slightly, but sieges still remain horrible affairs, with soldiers trying to shoot through walls, or even killing men on their own team. The combat aspect of this game is utterly broken, and considering that this is the crux of Empire's gameplay it leaves me to wonder why it has such glowing reviews.			",56,7,0,12,22,0,23

												Empire Total War is the elite strategy game. It might not have the graphics or the concepts of Rome Total War 2 but it still is loads of fun. I reccomend this game because it is so fun. The maps are beautiful and so is the warfare. And especially the DLC (Downloadable Content) The DLC is so cheap, and is worth it. And this game is so great to me because it was the first one I have ever bought on Steam. These were some reasons on why Empire Total War is a great game to download!			",20,2,0,3,1,0,11

												Empire Total War is quite a new direction for the Total War series in that it takes us into the age of muskets and cannons line infantry and skirmishing. But in my opinion this game is at its best in the area of campaign it brilliantly allows you the ability to create a continentel empire ranging from Europe America and India. The game campaign Ai is alot better than in previous installments and several new features such as the diplomatic system recruiting generals makes the campaign experience much more enjoyable. The multiplayer is good and has diversity perhaps not to the extent of the earlier games buts its still a solid experience it will be abit of a learning curve if your comming from Rome Total War and Medieval 2 but its enjoyable to learn all in all its a good Total War game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game truly brings out the strategy in it, the graphics are great, combat is great, and the realism of the cannons, rockets, bullets, etc are all together great considering that this is such an under-rated game is a shame when so many are missing out on the fun, the only annoyance of the game is the ""kill Moves"" when 2 are engaged in hand-to-hand combat they stand there fighting as the mass of 80 (for example) watches as the 2 men fight to the death and theres only that 1 enemy standing to fight, and the occasional glitch on troop placement is another but other than these 2 slight glitches i recommend this game to EVERYONE thats interested in TOTAL WAR and GLOBAL DOMINANCE.

												Ah, the game that introduced me to Steam and was my first Steam game.  CAs first real crack at focused firearm comat.  This one saw many ups and downs but is still one of the most memorable Total War Games for me, though not the best.  It was a truly experimental title for CA.  A new engine, completely different combat mechanics, the first title to allow manual naval combat, a new era, one of the biggest campaign maps yet, and the introduction of a tech research tree.  It was a breathtaking sight that, once growing pains had passed, delivered a monumental Total War experience that remains the title for which I most want a sequel.  Fall of the Samurai showed just how far CA has come with this style of warfare and I cannot wait.  All that being said, the game isn't without its flaws.  This was the last Total War title lacking cooperative multiplayer, there are a number a bugs, the AI is predictable, especially when they are defending a siege assault, and as with all Total War titles, the AI plays by a completely different set of BS rules.  Including non existant army upkeep, no resistance to occupation, agents with nigh 100% success rates... Even with its flaws, it is a unique Total War title that offers an experience no other in the series can, for now.  Absolutely recommend it.			",112,25,0,24,21,1,53

												I liked this game, I give it a 9.5/10. I like the time period it's set in, the realism, basically everything. Some might say the graphics are bad, but they aren't exactly the worst, so I don't really mind. It inputs a great system of what happened in the same time as it happened in real life. The only problem I have is in Campaign and how long it takes to go through CPU moves even though it doesn't show the CPU moves. If you like 18th century combat or just the century itself, I recommend this. I recommend this to ANYONE that would ask about this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best (only beaten by Medieval II) Total War games in the series. The graphics, both in the strategic view and battle view are excellent. The gameplay is smooth and its friendly to new players, offering all necessary tutorials. The only gripe with the game IMHO, is that it ends, there should be a continuous campaign, as each turns takes quite a large chunk of time, obviously it has to take building times into account etc but the campaigns are so engaging and perfectly crafted that they should be able to played without an end date. 9.5/10 , missing that .5 for ending.

I highly enjoyed playing this version of total war, mainly for the scope of area you can conquer (the world minus Africa and Eastern Asia) and scope of battles you can fight (with good unit variation). Highly recommended for any strategy and total war fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my humble opinion, Empire: TW is the most ambitious installment in the TW series to date.  With almost the whole world as your playground, you are able to build or destroy empires that cover enormous areas.  Only a world on such a scale can truly capture the impressiveness of your achievements, helping you match the greatness of empires and kingdoms now of by-gone years.That said, more up-to-date TW games have better battle mechanics and physics.  The battles themselves, whilst visually stunning, might sometimes leave you scratching your head as to why a perfectly placed unit didnt do what you hoped it would.  Things like line of sight are not as obvious in Empire.  The AI is probably as good as any other, although that isn't saying much.  Programming competitive AI in TW games must be a nightmare and is therefore going to always be a weak spot open for mass criticism.Overall, despite the short comings described, the feel of Empire is arguably unique in the series.  It is one of the few games these days which isnt 'finished' within 10-20 hours.  You can still be playing this game after hundreds if not thousands of hours and seeing new experiences and creating new narratives (if that's your thing).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Total War games of you like 18-19th century combat. Campaign opens for you literally the whole world except China and Asia, but you could still get to India. Do recomend, especially if you like building up an Empire, but when you have made one, it becomes a little bit borring as there is not many enemies which could challenge you and put under threat your existance.

												I won’t bore with a long review it’s a total war game with all the good and bad aspects that come with the line we love and hate, I’ll just tell you why I like it. I highly enjoyed playing this version of total war, mainly for the scope of area you can conquer (the world minus Africa and Eastern Asia) and scope of battles you can fight (with good unit variation). Highly recommended for any strategy and total war fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												202 hours, need I say more? Ok I will!Absolutely one of, if not the best title in the Total War line. With the absolutely breath taking grasp of the campaign mapor the massive battles, both land and sea, or a combo of both, this game has a great ability to draw you in and before you know it....... Its almost 7 years later , you now sport a mid chest length beard, got married and had a child. I find myself adding at least 10 hours a week to my already vast amount of TIME WELL WASTED on this title.100/10 Creative Assembly, well played...

												This game is easy to learn for everybody who is new to strategy games. The tutorials are really helpfull and in the normal campaigns you'll get hints on how to play with your nation.It is quite historically correct, which makes it also really interesting. And because you can choose your own difficulty it's challenging for beginners as well as more experienced players.You can choose from a bunch of nations to play the campaign with. Thanks to that you can spend many hours on this game without getting bored. The diplomacy features in this game are quite good, but they could be better. Religion is a great factor and the historical alliances are not easily broken, while in reality the nations switched alliances almost every generation.But besides that I'll recommend this game to everyone who likes strategy games or history games and who doesn't like to see to many complicated features to control a nation.

												You see, I bought the elite pack which contains the DLC and original game, although it was a bit pricey...Anyways, back to the game. Empire is quite different from the other games in the series because it allows Naval Battles! On this unique experience, you control your army on the 7 seas, versing A.I. or real people online or locally. It can get quite intense, as your ships may flee if damaged, but there are also contreversol wins!The game also allows you to (as I mentioned earlier) to play online with friends, or random people. The problem with online matches though, is that if your internet is bad, you must drop from the game. This can lead to frustraion from the opposing player. You can also do quick Naval or Land matches (Although, finding a game in the quick section is difficult.) You can team up and join an alliance in online matches too! They are quite intense! I prefer playing with friends, 'cause im so good at the game and I beat them :3.The Total War Series has never been known for graphics, but I have to say this game suprises me. My favourite part is seeing my men run into my enemy and watch the battle. You can see them have little battles with eachother! It looks quite realistic, as after the batttle you can see all the dead men that have fought.Overall this game is meant for RTS players who enjoy a good online battle. This game is simple to manuver and comprehend. This is my favourite out of the Total War series (personally.) Overall, It definately fed my hunger for a good bloodbath and RTS game. I give it a 8.5/10!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												campaign and multiplayer are both fun. its a cool time era and has many improvements with mods. a few annoying bugs and ai is bad (as in most total war games). i got it on sale so it was definitely worth the money($5). play this game if you like European history during the 1700s, total war games, or want a fun turn based and RTS strategy game. my main gripe with this game  is that it is kind of euro-centric. the only 2 playable factions unlocked in the vanilla game which arent european being the Ottoman Empire which is kind of european and  the Marathra Empire.

												I completely recommend this game. It's already a few years old, so I would advise to wait for a sale perhaps... but considering that I have spent that many hours on Steam playing this game (and many hours off-Steam as well), even paying the full price does not mean you'll feel ripped off. You're not only buying quite a lot of game with your purchase, you're also buying the best single-player experience any Total War can bring you.Total War is a series that combines the most massive and spectacular battles you will find in any game with the building and managing of an empire in single player. In multiplayer it's the best game of chess you can have. This particular Total War is set in the early Modern Age (1700-1800), and for the first time includes line-infantry with muskets as the backbone of an army and not a melee unit, which makes for a unique Total War. In this era, the European countries were involved in a lot of wars with eachother while they conquered several continents and established trade routs with most of the rest of the world, and I do not know of any other media that encompasses that much of this era like in Empire: Total War.From my point of view, this is the last of the true and classic Total War games. I have played every Total War (including Shogun) and my favorites are Rome 1 (not rome 2, absolutely not rome 2) because of the way it represents the classical era, Empire because I am personally very interested in this era as well and it is unique in the ranged combat with muskets and I love Shogun 2, because it simply has the best multiplayer. There is also a stand-alone expansion of Empire about the conquests of Napoleon, something I had been anticipating for many years, but I didn't like it enough. It's too limited. I also don't appreciate a lot from the medieval era in general. It's chaotic, it's too religious/christian, there is no progress, there is death, decay, famine and the plague and Medieval Total War games represent this fine, I don't like it.Why do I consider this the last Classic Total War? Well, Total War is a game that, as you play, can teach you stuff. Like in Rome1 you learn that clear glass was invented, in Empire you get info along the way about what happened in the 18th century and it was a lot. In fact, the only good description I can find about my 'religion', Secular Humanism, I found in Empire Total War. This is also the last Total War in which the campaign map is open, you can send your armies where you want and you're not stuck in corridors like in the latest installments. However, it is the first Total War to include a tech-tree and naval battles (and naval battles were very spectacular in this era!).The 3 continents you can explore with armies and conquer are Europe, North and Middle America and the Indian sub-continent (you can walk from Western-Europe to India if you please, or sail around Africa). There are also a few trade regions to conquer using just the navy: the east coast of South-America, the west coast of Africa, the strait of Madagaskar and the East-Indies. Every region has it's own feel and it's own enviroments, cultures, empires and people.The units you command are also unique for each culture. Yes, warfare was a lot about standing in lines facing eachother firing lead balls back and forth and then reloading for quite some time, the native americans for instance are better equiped for guerilla style battles combining melee with light infantry equipes with muskets or bow and arrow. Along the tech-tree you unlock new units to build and command, artillery changes from simple big cannons to a whole specrum of weaponry. Ranging from mortars to puckle-guns (rapid fire musket, very early machinegun) and stuff in between. Cavalry also comes in many flavors, dragoons that melee on horseback but function as line infantry dismounted, full melee cavalry and the cavalry even gains horsedrawn cannons as technology is invented. And the ships! Oh man, imagine the big ships of the line with over 40 cannons on each broadside, 2 lines come within eachothers range... just crank up the sound to really loud!Like most Total War games, the game has improved a lot because of mods, Empire is no exception. Even for new players I would recommend to install and use at least Darth Mod, which can be found in the Steam Workshop. More units are also available with mods, but I'm not sure which one to recommend. But the Darth Mod really improves the ai and the feel of the game.Every Total War has it's own features and it's own feel to it. Personally I find this installment the best in single-player of the entire series. I have had some really tight battles in the campaign. In Empire it is possible to position your men in some buildings, so making a last stand gets it's own feeling to it. Your men firing from the windows at incoming soldiers while your lines of infantry try to hold the lines in front of that building, untill the fight turns melee when the bayonets are pointed at eachother.And I haven't even mentioned the historical battles that come with each Total War, you can reenact battles that actually took place and with a historically similar setting and armies to command. Pitching you as Washington vs the Brittish and many others. There is a demo available here on Steam, in it you can play at least one of these historical battles and get a glimpse of what is in store for you when it comes to battles, but if you like games like Civilization or RTS games like Age of Empires and you haven't tried Total War at all, you will love it!

												Empire: Total War takes us away from the battlefields of both Ancient and Middle Aged Europe and Middle-East and takes us to the Empires of Europe during the 18th Century. Muskets and Cannon now determines who is the most powerful in all of Europe, Improved graphics and gameplay makes the game more exciting and stunning for Total War fans. Campaigns follow George Washington as he revisits the past from the development of Jamestown (1607), to the French and Indian War (1740's to 1750's), and to the American War of Independence (1775-1783). Not only can the battles between the European powers take place in Europe and the Middle-east, but also the Colonies of North America and South America and to the Colonies of India. Trade and expansion is key to your nation's victory, expanding out to colonies and your Empire's borders are crucial. The century turns to the the advancement of technology and development of new forms of Government. A time when the system of Monarchy seems to crumble while Republics and Democracies rise. Revolution and Colonization has made the 18th Century one of the world's most crucial centuries in all of the World's History. Will you reign or will you revoutionize a new Empire, the choice is yours. The times of Royal familes and difference in social class lays in your hands, will you preserve it or will you destroy it?

												Needs mods to unlock true potential. I myself enjoyed the naval combat. Not sure why people complain about it being slow. It wind powered so if your ships are facing in the wrong direction , you won't move. I though the naval combat was a great addition and I miss it when I play MTW2. Here is the biggest let up is the melee makes no sense since every character is in a solo fight. The character beside him won't strike but spectate. If you don't mind the broken melee, then the game is a great product. Mods also adds create value and that's what saves this game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the last truly awesome Total War game.  Sure the naval game is a goofy PITA, but its got sooooo much replayability.  The key thing this game has that the ones coming after didn't is that the factions feel distinct.  Your play style is to some extent changed and stretched with each faction you play; you cannot successfully copy and paste the way you play Russia the same way you play Netherlands without serious alterations to your cookie cutter plan.I only wish Shogun and Rome 2 hadn't let us down and turned the franchise into a glitchy, soulless DLC mill.

												This game is easy to learn for everybody who is new to strategy games. The tutorials are really helpfull and in the normal campaigns you'll get hints on how to play with your nation.It is quite historically correct, which makes it also really interesting. And because you can choose your own difficulty it's challenging for beginners as well as more experienced players.You can choose from a bunch of nations to play the campaign with. Thanks to that you can spend many hours on this game without getting bored. The diplomacy features in this game are quite good, but they could be better. Religion is a great factor and the historical alliances are not easily broken, while in reality the nations switched alliances almost every generation.But besides that I'll recommend this game to everyone who likes strategy games or history games and who doesn't like to see to many complicated features to control a nation.

												Soooo, this is my first ""Proper"" Review, so let's get some kind of system going:First, a overall ""look"" at the game.Second, the good part's.Third, the bad part's.Fourth, a Summary.Also, note that im bad at spelling, so don't expect it to be good. These review's, in which i plan to do more, are mean't to be quick so don't expect some massive amount of information.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, let's get started:So, what is this game? this is an RTS based in the time era of 1700-1799, focused on the combat system of unit's, usually containing about 120 men, then lining them up to fire, reload, and fire again. and although this sound's dull, it is actually a great system. This is mainly due to the fact that you can do some very intelligent thing's involving cavalary, using real life tactics to win battle's, such as flanking attack's with some light cav to divert their attention. There is also a grand campain option, in which you lead your country through the time period, with the options of building unit's, building's to allow the building of said units and help the economy. There is also a diplomatic system to allow alliances, trading and war. The battle's work by moving armies across the map, then going down into a standard battle. There is also the feature of naval battles, in which you must use the wind and naval positions to your advantage----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------so, let's go through the pro's and con's:Pro's:Great battle's which require a good amount of thinking, and immerse you in the great looking combat.Good match-making and battle options, which allow you to change options such as map, weather, time period and such.Good grand campain, allowing you to make an empire in your vission.Con's:High learning curve, requiring a good few hours to get to grip's with.Linear grand campain, although it allows freedom, it doesn't include the whole world. Also, a lack of countries to choose from  makes it even more linear.Overall, if you like RTS Game's with a good amount of planning and thinking involved, i would rally recommend this game!

												Honestly, I have a lot of good and a lot of bad to say about etw......Now this game, it will always hold a special place in my heart. ETW is the game that not only introduced me to the total war series, but it did a damn good job of doing so. Not only that, but it also introduced me to steam itself, being the very first steam game I ever played. There are not many games based in this time period, but ETW gives you the opportunity to dive right into the thick of the 1700s world as a emperor hell bent on world domination, and the route you take to achieve that, is paved by the beating of drums as your musket armed soldiers march along, and the waving of the sails of your mighty navy to the far reaches of the 1700s world. I am making references to the campaign of course, because at first, I cared not about online battles......kinda because I had no internet at the time. Though the community surrounding this game has all but died out, I must testify that it was once very big and very competitive, with many many clans that have come and gone since this game's release, and once I became aware of it, I sought out to claim my own personal glory in many different clan, but only 2 of those clan I remained apart of for years. This game was a great journey and a very worthwhile investment back in the day, but if you just wanna play campaign, then even for that reason I'd reccomend etw. However......now that I have given what was great about this game, now let me address the game's many flaws.......the game itself is buggy to the point where sometimes it will crash for seemingly no reason at all. Units have been known to do some very interesting things that may not put a smile on your face in the heat of a intense battle as well. And even though there are many factions in this game, let me be the one to tell you, the factions are almost the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing, and there are slight differences in play style for each. Basically, you have middle eastern style factions, european style factions << Overpowered and then you have indians who aren't good at all until you get the DLC units for them. Out of those 3 classifications, you have a lot of european factions that have some unique units to each, but for the most part thier the same thing, and use the same basic strategy if your a seasoned veteran of the game like myself. Once you play, and like NTW, ETW feels rather generic and you see it for what it really is. But was ETW truly a fail? Thats a foolish question, for all it's flaws, this game is truly a diamond in the rough and thats the best way to sum it up. If your someone who wants the feeling of conquering the world, I'd highly reccomnd this game to you. If you want a competitive clan community, then I must say, theres not much left these days, but if you want it, by all means, go for it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the terrible ai, the game is pretty great. It was amazing for its time and it is pretty good for todays standards as well. I would even go as far as to say some features in this game surpass some other Total war games recently released. I've never really had that much fun with trading as i had in this game as of late. Dont buy this as your first Total war game though. I think the newer titles are better for that. Unless you are particulary interested in the time period this game offers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As the Total War Series free weekend comes to a close, I would like to recommend Total War: Empire, not only is it another great total war game, there is much more focus patience and strategy, than there is in the older games, with there more aggressive style. Keep in mind, this is all just my opinion based on how I played these games, however like any of the Total War games, each one is different enough that it would take you actually playing them all to know what one you like most!

												I was playing as Sweden first the russian declared war on me, I beat them after about 20 turns or more now my empire is HUGE. So after I beat the russian i took a fleat of ships, loaded them all with line infantry and canons, went to north america attacked the 13 colonies took all there land but also now my british are at war with me so I saild a few ships and army there took them all out, they offer me a peace treaty so I accepted it. Now my empire is really strong I feel unbeatable so I started a campaign on the ottomans lost half of my men against farmers with pitch forks (I had line infantry), finally i took one of the citys of the ottomans. But it was not long untill 3 armys attack my new conquered city, they all have elephants with poeple riding on them with guns so now I lost the battle so my city was recaptured my the ottomans. Now its my turn so I send my men down south to attak the ottomans I attack some of there armys and farms, I could not move my men down any more so i end the turn, all of a sudden the austrian declared war on me, so now I need to attack from 2 fronts. After about 10 turns ottomens and austrian took all of my captured rusian citys, they pushed my back all the way to the motherland, now im ♥♥♥♥ed I half of my army is at north america fighting, so what i did was I loaded all of my men into ships and saild back the sweden it took me a few turns but good thing my men manage to hold the invaders back. So now my whole army is at the motherland, first I tried to make a peace treaty with them but the dident accept so I sent my men to attack but lost to the ottomens now im really ♥♥♥♥ed (at the mean time i lost all my Citys to the natives) so I loaded my last few ships and men and sailed for india I got there after a few turns i attack the united provinces small island in india won the battle also at the same time my main city in sweden was captured by the ottomens good thing i won the battle with the united provinces or it would have kicked my out of the game. So now I have to go eat (Dinner) i was about to save my game then it crashed took me 4 days to play saved only 3 times lost some of my progress but it was still fun to make history and kill hundred of civlian and soilders. 10/10 would play agian			",128,7,1,8,19,0,16

												This is yet another awesome game in the Total War series.  All total war games are worth purchasing in my opinion, but this one in particular was the first total war to truly introduce the use of large scale firearms as apposed to melee combat.  The game looks very nice, and like all modern Total War games it has an extensive modding community that can increase your overall enjoyment of the game.   I highly suggest you buy this game.

												The Grand Campaign's map (SP) is so large. There's almost whole world geography. But; the diplomacy is not good enough. There's no way to liberate nations, request nations to get a war against another nation, breaking alliences, trading embargoes etc.By the way there's same problem on the each game that Napoleon TW and Empire TW. It is an historical fail. Crimean Khanate, Degastan and Georgia talk in ""Russian Language"" but in the history they talk in; Crimean Tatar, Chechen and Georgian languages.And there's Greece talking in Turkish. It's kinda fail too.Also there's lots of bugs and glitches on the MP of the Empire Total War. But I recommended this game because of the size of the map, being a fan of Total War and nation counts. There's lots of Major and Minor nations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire: Total War does have some bugs and minor crashes, But if you get DarthMod it makes the game alot better, And also adds in additional units and takes out the crashes and bugs. I really have to say this is a really good strategy game, Imagine your playing against your friend and his army is slowly marching towards yours your heart is beating 1,000 MPH per minute then when they raise their rifles your heart stops then BOOM, The fun just begins. The link for the mod that fixes bugs and adds additional units and fixes crashes and etc is DarthMod the link is http://www.modsaholic.com/forums/index.php/files/file/71-darthmod-empire/ Just click that link and hit download it is a big file 2.80 GB it does upgrade your graphics to make the units more realistic and adds gun sounds and just a all around great Mod. I really love the Total War Series, I recommend this game to everyone. It is history in the makings. It is actually a really fun game even without the mod though, It just fixes the campaign crashes other than that it is just an amazing game, I would say it is worth being in your library. I put so many hours and hard work into this game, It is cheap too. So grab yourselfs a copy and you will really enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all this game is awesome! 99/100!This is a fantastic Strategy/War game. Great graphics with a good multiplayer experience. Pretty realistic and historically accurate with units and ships. There are 4 online gamemodes to choose from which are: Land, Sea, Siege and Scenario. If you like to control armies, then this game is for you! The single player campaigns are quite interesting and worth it. There are plenty of DLC's to get to make the game even better. Only some minor gliches where you somehow desync out of a match but other then that this game is great.I really recommend this game. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an amazing game if you love history and strategy.

												I've decided to simply this review into points-No way to make peace without simply fully annexing as AI thinks it's god and will not surrender land -Multiple Bugs-No 3+ Player Seiges-Campaign Map split across 3 continents-Stupid AI cant use ships to transport troops across the ocean and constantly sends offers to sell provinces in eastern russia for scotland (Example) not exchanging colonies or border lands-Combat isn't enjoyable since everybody shoots then everybody charges (Medivel 2 and Rome 1 have much better combat as you have your basic Melee,Ranged,Cavalry)-Napoleon is basically Empire 2.0 But better even if on a smaller scale-Seiges no longer include city-size battles but simply battles over tiny forts-Elite Units (Such as guards) dont really have much diffrence from regular in battles unlike other titles-The other buildings in provinces are just random points for enemies to raid (No forts around the towns though) -City Expansion  is reliant on population whitch never goes up -Capturing a city forces you to wait there to wait there for years to calm it down until you can expand and unlike other titles there are no rebel lands where you can expand so you sit there waiting to be able to attack (Other titles also solve this by giving you to burn and slave options)-Protectorates are useless and all they do is remove the mystique of latin america and replaces it with a big ""Spain already owns this and won"" sign. Isn't the point of this game to colonise?			",13,1,0,3,10,0,6

												Inability to lead troops as Monarchs, so Carlorus Rex or Frederick the Great, and all AI Cavlary Regiments being led by Louis Nolan kept me from getting into this game too much. Multiplayer was the only thing I could have enjoyed if it was not for the painfully unbalanced Artillery. Most Artillery in the game is led by Psychics so they are able to lead moving regiment without problem and some of the higher ranking Howitzers can kill 5-10 men a hit.			",61,10,0,8,16,0,21

BUT its bugged as hell, even after all those years they cant fix the autosave crashes, memory loss, corrupted saves and AI likes to freak out during the siege.

												Impossible to make a list of all the bugs in the♥♥♥♥♥♥game. If you dont mind every nation falling into 1 of 3 catagories (European,Indian,Middle Eastern) And all of those nations having the SAME units in a battle, and don't mind constant game breaking bugs, and clones fighting each other, then Empire is ok. Every single European nation has *Line Infantry* Which are EXACTLY the same skin exept differant colors. The Same uniform. So battles look like a bunch of multi colored clones shooting at each other. Theres also *Regament of Horse* Which almost every European nation has by defult and theres absolutly no differance but once again differant colors. Each nation also has the same ships. There are a few units although that differ. If you want some real differance spend your money on DLC for expensive or Overpowered Units. Theres also the unbalanceness of Empire. Say you are playing as Britain and you want to conquer France, France only has 2 regions in Europe, take them, and everything else France has dissapears. Bacically 1 region is almost Entire France, the other one is Alsace Lorraine which has barely any garrison.Theres much more to tell about, if this stuff doesent bother you, go ahead and buy Empire, But 80% of my hours are on Darthmod, which most say took empire from the dephs of a pit and pushed it into something great.

												This game is completely worth every penny in the price! This is a RTS fans dream come true!Let me hit the highlights of this game:The graphics and sound effects make it feel as if your actually in an 18th century army. When I get off the game, I sometimes feel as if Im getting out of a time machine, bringing myself back from the past, back to the present.Building and researching takes a little figuring out and can be confusing, but you'll see things as you play. Completing the tutorial will also help.On the Grand Campaign, it is CRITICAL you begin recruiting, and researching military stuff immediately. The easier the setting, the lesser the AI will attack you, but they'll come. My favorite faction is Prussia. However, when you first begin the Grand Campaign, there is a ton of factions. Even factions you cant choose from. Usually, around the fourth turn, Prussia and Austria declare war on each other, because they are close to each other and hostile towards the other. So, whichever faction you choose to be, be warned: the factions that are your neighbors are most likely to declare war against you.Once you enter battle, your given time to setup your troops. If your using cannons, it is VITALE you set them up before the battle begins. They setup into firing position slow and can be moved slow. Very realistic, so it takes away any annoying feeling.You will need to build navies. Those can be extra challenging. The cost of a single ship is extra high, so building a huge navy is slow. Its also pretty hard to have multiple huge navies at the same time. Although most helpful, usually its best to build a navy when your ready for use.Naval battles are probably the most difficultest battle. The ships sail slowly. The AI usually starts in a single line, and spreads out, slowly, encircling your ships. These battles vary in time length, usually depending on who has the more battle ships. A variety of ships helps.In the Grand Campaign, they also have notes mentioning historical events, such as Captain Kidd being hung, the start of circus's and much, much, much more.When I tried an online multi player battle, I was in RTS gamers heaven. No matter the AI, playing against an opponent who thinks, is 100 times better. Especially when you win.Overall, if anyone likes history, strategy, thinking, or strategy games, this game is for them! 100/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire: Total War was the first Strategy game I've played. I saw the game and said ""Hmm, looks cool"".  I downloaded the demo, and spended about a day, playing each mission.Then i bought the game. It was amazing. Commanding my first empire was a blast, conquering Indian Tribes, and sailing to the Americas, discovering new lands. The AI wasn't the best, so I took a break and downloaded Darth Mod.Then, I jumped back straight onto the game with Darthmod UC. Then I started my 2nd Empire. I realized how better it was, and much more challenging. I kept Darthmod, because it improved graphics, and AI. Then I got used to the game. I decided to begin a bigger Empire with much more enemies. I started focusing on Economy and it really helped. I got trade and towns up. I got so much money, that I made a huge army. I felt so good.Thats when the colonies decided to declare independance. I got pretty mad, so I discovered I could have relations. Know I knew alot of the game. I was ready.I sailed with my allies to the new Americas. There, the war with the Rebels lasted 3 Years in-game. I had a blast battling. I gave some land to my allies in the Americas to avoid rebels. I took the Americas back for myself then. After I had conquered most of the Americas, I decided to move into uncharted land and waters. I found tribes, and made allies, and made new enemies. I was amazed by the game. I conquered many new lands, and made many enemies.My empire became power hungry, and I fell apart. I was so happy, and I enjoyed myself. Just next time, hope to lead a more successful empire.If your looking for a game like this, buy it. The AI is not the best, but there are mods that fix the game.

This game is still worth playing single player in despite it's being half a decade old.  Game experience can be improved with mods, however dont expect complete overhaul mods like you may have played in RTW or MTW II.9/10!			",6,0,0,0,1,0,9

												Its killing me nowBest strategy game everHighly recommend I have been an RTS fan since early on, played all the great names from Command & Conquer to Wh40k: Dawn of War. Of all these games, Empire:TW brought the biggest satisfaction. The game might be getting old now, but it`s glory doesn't fade. Even if you never played Total War games before, this is a must buy for any RTS fan.Starting from the graphics. Like said, some time passed since it`s release, but never the less, when put on max. settings it is still beautiful. The sound is done quite well. I enjoy every round of shots made from the infantery, the roar of canons, the thousands of feet marching to the beat of the drum, the hissing of primitive missiles in the air.....The game itself gives you a lot of feautres. The two singleplayer modes let you play as some of the greatest nations of the time, from Prussia to the Maratha Confederacy (the other SP mode let`s you play as the United States on their way to independence). Your job is to form alliances, make trade, conquer areas, defeat your enemies, develop your nation, and if you feel like it, you can always coup the monarchy and establish a republic. The campaign itself is turn based, moving your armies and agents in a pre-set range of movement each season, governing your cities and doing some diplomacy along the way. The battles on the other hand are real-time, but you can change the speed of battle from slow-motion all the way to fast. The map on which you play on is determined by the region you are fighting in. Battles can be either the classical land battles, sieges or naval battles. If you don't feel like doing a battle, but you have good chances, simply click autoresolve (save the battle just in case you get defeated). The multiplayer is also quite good, letting several players play as their favourite nation and setting up their army. You can join your friends and fight bots, do 1v1, or a large scale battle of up to 6 players 3v3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire: Total War is one of the two games in creative assembly's Total War franchise that I have had the privledge of playing. After a rough start when attempting to launch the game (and a few crashes in the first few hours of play), I was supprised to find a that this was indeed a great game, and worth the fourteen dollars at which it is currently priced on steam. While the long load times and frequent graphical bugs aren't game breaking, they do definitley do a disservice to what is otherwise a great game. I would recommend this to any total war fans, as well as strategy fans in general.			",1,1,0,1,0,0,5

												Empire Total War is one of the best games I have ever played. You can play this game in many ways like a Civization game with the campagin map but. It was A LOT of replay value since if you choose to play as a different nation they have comepletley different play styles, units, and diplomecy which makes two play throughs of Grand Campagin completley different. In combat however is where it really shines. The strategy is SO in depth about how to deploy your units, when to deploy your units, and what formation is extremly fun. It is also EXTREMLY detailed as you can zoom in and clearly see your units individually and watch them fight. My favorite part is to look after a big battle at the battlefield where you can look at all of the bodies bc they dont despawn and you can see where they were deployed and how bloody was the combat it is amazing, However the diplomecy can be annoying with the AI and they are kinda dumb but all is forgiven if you choose to go on hard and play the battles yourseld because that is where the focus is.                                                                                  If you are new to the series this is one of the most realistic RTS games out there. I have seen on the Military History Channel a show called Deceisive Battles I believe it was called and they used Rome: Total War to simulate the battles with amazing accuracy.

												Many people call this one of the worst total wars ever. But this is far from true, yes the loading times are long, but remember that this is the first total war with the new engine. Furthermore the multiple map system is the best idea ever. The battles are epic to watch (thousends of men fire upon the other side looks just great!!!). And the artillery just gives a new dimension in the battles.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,6

												I had been looking at this game for quite sometime time and during the sale I bought it. At first the game would just crash when ever I tried to start a campaing or tutorial. However, since I fixed it (I think) I've had nothing but fun playing it, I love building up my empire and crushing those who stand in my way. However, sometimes after extensive play time it has a tendency to crash when trying to start a battle or the frame rate will turn to crap. That aside I really, really enjoy this game and I'm going to invest alot of time into it!Rule britannia!			",199,21,6,17,21,1,25

												Empire Total War is an excellent addition to the Total War Series. The additions to the campaign overview are numerous and multi-faceted, and really add another dimension to the game. The relation system is much more explicitly explained, and the trade system has received an overhaul. The combat mechanics are much more measured than the melee centric focus of previous titles. Manouvering and positiong for the optimal output for fire is the name of the game here			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like strategy and commanding thousands of troops in battle, and if you like 18th and 19th century games, this is for you. You can command thousands of troops on huge land battles, or HUGE battleships at sea, or just a little skirmish with a couple hundred specially trained troops. There is a campain where you reserch new technologys, or you can go online and battle against and with other players. You can have HUGE (laggy) battles with 3-8 teams battling at once! And ALL this for only $20! This is a great game, and I definitely reccomend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favourite out of the total war series franchise so far that I have played, but thats just my opinion. It's quite in depth for the era it represents and the game is really enjoyable. I have spent many hours marching my empire towards victory, economically, logistically, militarily and politically. One moment I am a general leading my armies and the next I am a diplomat. Absolutely love this game :) I love the fact you can even personalise your regiments which is added fun.Some down sides are the unit cards could be improved, more locations and more option to customise your nation. Also the diplomacy could be a bit more in depth. Overall a very pleasant gaming experience and will continues to be.But for what it's worth and the price I paid for it I can't knock it and I would reccommend it. Hours of fun and joy thats what I look for within a game and this I got. Thumbs up Total War :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not bad, it was broken at launch and that got it a bad rep so no one really payed attention to it even when they fixed it. Campaign map is huge though, good for darthmod or empire total factions (I think thats the name of the mod). Multiplayer is eh kinda dead and a bit broken, Extreme range rifle units, Nuclear howitzers, And Light dragoons that are more accurate than infantry... But if you get good you will ignore these things. Although i dont think the game is worth it at 20.00$. Buy Napoleon Total War if you like multiplayer. Its 15.00$ With a bigger online community left thanks to Youtubers like robinhoodgaming, and a bit smaller but more detailed campaign map. Darthmod also works better on Napoleon Total War. But i will still reccomend this game to people who want a long term campaign, you can dominate The Early Americas, The Middle East, India, And of course Europe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:+ Only TW to date that's in the gunpowder age+ Naval combat is exciting and yet to be topped by the titles after it+ Geographically the largest, and most diverse, TW game+ Unit variety (gunpowder, melee, cavalry, artillery, etc) makes land combat more intricate and strategic+ Introduced the tech tree+ Agents are now more useful and have more impact on the campaign mapCons:- Very poor release debut (almost as bad as Rome 2: Total War)- Naval combat does have some kinks- No real depth for Generals and no Family Tree- Dramatically limited modding compared to past titlesThe Bottom LineCreative Assembly took quite a risk with Empire: Total War.The franchise up to this point was firmly rooted in the melee combat eras of warfare and the concept of adapting the gameplay to anything after 15th century Europe seemed like an unappealing and potentially problematic idea.To a degree those reactions weren't quite baseless when the game finally released with an unhealthy amount of performance and technical issues but once those started to get hammered out and players started getting into the meat of the game the experience turned out to be quite enticing.As with all Total War games however the experience the player gets out of the game is highly reliant on whether or not the time period is personally appealing. Those who find the 18th century interesting will obviously find a lot to love here but those uninterested may move on fairly quickly.8 musketballs out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, the only reason why I am still playing whole Total War games are battles. But these are in vanilla just terrible, so it is almost unplayable without some good mod(personally preferring DarthMod). Things about how bad campaigns in those games really are, are better to be unspoken. At least DarthMod campaign is bit better but of course it just can't smooth all mistakes made in vanilla. So I would not recommend this without mod but if you look at some of their newer games, you will understand that this game was their golden age. Thumb up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played Total War games for years (The original Rome and Medieval all the way to the newest Rome) I always enjoy going back and starting a new campaign in Empire Total War. I won't lie, the AI can be a little frustrating. (Especially during diplomacy) Though they can be frustrating, the scale of the game and the heat of battle blow the AI's short commings out of the water. The feature of this game that excits me the most is the scale of the world. The world is divided into three theaters, the Americas, India, and Eurpope allowing you to engage in wars in three differant parts of the world at once (both on land and sea). I strongly recomend this game for anyone who is a fan of the franchise or is looking for a 1700's/1800's strategy game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. I have played quite a lot of this game over the years and i have throughly enjoyed myself and still do, i always end up coming back to this game time and time again. The theatre system really helps to make your empire feel huge as it stretches several continents. The combat can get a bit boring at times when your troops just stand there exchanging fire but there is much more strategical depth to it then that. The variation of units isn't bad and with the DLC and mods there is a lot of unique units. I feel that this game has a lot of replayablity because every campaign is different and there are soo many different ways you can approach empire building, there is also a lot of depth into unit research which add new formations and equipment to you units which can change the way you play. This is one of my favorite games of all time, i definetly recommend this game if you have enjoyed any of the other total war games. But if you have played napoleon total war you might find some things lacking like having client states and less ship variation but having theatres really makes up for it in my opinion.

												I had been looking at this game for quite sometime time and during the sale I bought it. At first the game would just crash when ever I tried to start a campaing or tutorial. However, since I fixed it (I think) I've had nothing but fun playing it, I love building up my empire and crushing those who stand in my way. However, sometimes after extensive play time it has a tendency to crash when trying to start a battle or the frame rate will turn to crap. That aside I really, really enjoy this game and I'm going to invest alot of time into it!Rule britannia!			",199,21,6,17,21,1,25

You can command thousands of troops on huge land battles, or HUGE battleships at sea, or just a little skirmish with a couple hundred specially trained troops. There is a campain where you reserch new technologys, or you can go online and battle against and with other players. You can have HUGE (laggy) battles with 3-8 teams battling at once! And ALL this for only $20! This is a great game, and I definitely reccomend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In Empire there are three campaign maps in one. America, Europe and India. It is also good because there are a lot of diverse nations to play as.

												This is now becoming an old game compaired to the latest and newest games in the Total War franchise but i still enjoy this game. I have playing this game for a long time and i still manage to enjoy its endless options on who to play as and what you want to do, i like to play sweden and take over the Americas and thats just one of the many options availbale. Now with the newer games like Shogun 2 and Napoleon (wasn't really a fan of Rome 2) this game has been outdone in graphics and more but i still like to come back to this game when i have spare time and ready up my army for a battle against the russian war machine or a naval battle against the french. This game by itself is fun but the most fun comes from mods, but there is one that is essential: http://www.moddb.com/mods/darthmod-empireThis is a game changing mod that opens up a wide and new expanise world to play in with larger amounts of troops, better graphics, new and improved sounds, gameplay and the ability to play as almost any faction that is not available in the normal game. This lets you play as minor nations like the knights of st. john and other minor factons, because of this ability to play as lesser factions opens up a new level of freedom the orignal game doesn't offer. The new A.I makes the game harder to play due to it being stronger and you the choice to start off weaker. This game is getting old compared to the new total war games but this is your game. with over +300 hours on it i still enjoy it, for only $20 i think it is worth picking up this game if you are looking for a good strategy war game set in the 18th century. I hope this helped influence your choice and this is just my opion of the game and should not be interprated as fact.			",52,5,0,4,9,0,16

												I was never a fan of the Total War series but the videos of all those ridiculously huge battles was always something I loved. After being tempted and pushed to try this title by one of my friends, I decided to sit down and give it a go. And I love it. Micromanaging an Empire, building up Units and conquering lands along with huge battles and drawn out sequences make this a tactician's wet dream. This is the first Total War game that I have ever played and sat down thoroughly with.I am not disappointed. On the other hand, I was informed by many that [Darthmod] improves the game substantially, so I have never truly experienced the ""Vanilla"" version of the game (one which is untouched by mods and 3rd party fixes). I love Darthmod and ETW, both compliment one another and with the whole new addition of extra units and better A.I. this really vamps up the game as a whole. See the end of the review for more links on where to download Darthmod.I do, however, admit that ETW does suffer from its fair share of bugs and broken game issues but do not let that detract you from buying this. It's a great title. I have purchased all the DLC for the game too and the extra units are *very* much worth it. Heck, even game changing! A great title, yet sometimes awkward to play due to strange A.I. behaviour and crashes due to... well, we all know that Total War games since Empire are buggy and unfixed.Overall score: 8/10 (it'd be a lot lower without the mods I've added :p)Darthmod v.8.0 on ModDB.I would highly suggest you download this mod via Torrent! It's a lot faster and easier to obtain, I find ModDB's speeds too slow. Be sure to seed back to atleast 90% for everyone else who wants the mod too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm almost breaching playtime of 1000 hours. After all this time, Empire never fails me. It has had a buggy release, a bumpy start... but I've not played the same amount of time on any other Total War game. Why? Because Empire: Total War has an immense replayability, lots of factions, a great modding community with a large variety of mods, a whole century to play in and half the world as a map. It's a game you'll come back to. I know the Total War fanbase is often divided in those that favour melee like Medieval, Rome... and those that have a soft spot for the muskets. I'm with the latter, but give it a shot. It's a versatile game.Also, I'd like to recommend Napoleon: Total War, but where it excels in graphics and gameplay over Empire, it lacks replayability. I, for one, shall always return to Empire for a couple of extra hours of fun. Be it now, or in days or weeks, I'll play this game. To end, I'd like to underline the fact that the uniforms of this era are made to outfab the opponent. Yes, that's right, no plain, boring khakis for this man. I find the lack of fab in today's warfare... disturbing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People are right. It is glitchy. I've raged quit many games and had to restart many games due to glitches. The first major glitch is invisable troops, you could send 3 line units to a unit of rifleman thinking you'll win easy. Than BOOM appears out of no where a unit of troops is sitting there waiting for you probably thinking wtf were you thinking, lol. The multiplayer is okay.... but abunch of rule breakers that ruin it. The singleplayer isn't my style.... I don't know how to explain it, but I like medieval 2's single player much better.

As an avid fan of the Total War series the amazing team behind Creative Assembly have never once let me down with a Total War title. I admit it took me a few hours to adapt to Empire when I first played it, but once those intitial phases of getting the feel for it had passed I couldn't stop playing it.For fans of Total War, or fans of stratergy games looking for something perhaps a little different.

												Well, the only reason why I am still playing whole Total War games are battles. But these are in vanilla just terrible, so it is almost unplayable without some good mod(personally preferring DarthMod). Things about how bad campaigns in those games really are, are better to be unspoken. At least DarthMod campaign is bit better but of course it just can't smooth all mistakes made in vanilla. So I would not recommend this without mod but if you look at some of their newer games, you will understand that this game was their golden age. Thumb up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game if you enjoy history with a taste of strategy. Nothing is more exhillerating than charging your enemy with a full infantry and watching them fall as you claim victory. The online play is also very enjoyable as well. You can do 2 vs 2, which makes it an amazing game to play with friends.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is what made me into a Total War fan. It is so much fun to watch hundreds of infantry from each side lining up all neat and tidy, and then throwing walls of lead at each other, sometimes leading to an all-out melee brawl. This is the game to get to watch tons of ground soldiers fight it out with muskets and bayonets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The multiplayer matchmaking system is poor, and the game can drop you out at any time. The campaign is great but sometime is can bug out.

												My personal favourite total war. Just the graphics combined with the era leads to explosive battles of cannons and muskets. The only critisizm I have of the game is that a lot of nations have the same troops just called something different. The best bit about this total war games is the ability to invade early 1700s Ameirca and India and the sheer vaiety of native troops that come with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far the best total war since the original. Huge scale, big improvments to unit fighting and the time period of the units works well with this style of game play.

												Fun world domination. Once the wars get old or slow, just overwhelm and auto resolve combat. Take a weak nation, and eventually own all of Europe, the Americas, Noarth Africa, Middle East, Russia, and India. Lots of infrastructure upgrades. Making allies, keeping them, dealing with enemies, and the killing allies is what this game is about. Diplomacy, War, Nation Building, and Strategy. Great all around, until you finally beat it, or take over most of the world. After that, it sits in your libraru untouched like most other games.			",38,5,0,12,7,0,8

												My favourite out of the total war series franchise so far that I have played, but thats just my opinion. It's quite in depth for the era it represents and the game is really enjoyable. I have spent many hours marching my empire towards victory, economically, logistically, militarily and politically. One moment I am a general leading my armies and the next I am a diplomat. Absolutely love this game :) I love the fact you can even personalise your regiments which is added fun.Some down sides are the unit cards could be improved, more locations and more option to customise your nation. Also the diplomacy could be a bit more in depth. Overall a very pleasant gaming experience and will continues to be.But for what it's worth and the price I paid for it I can't knock it and I would reccommend it. Hours of fun and joy thats what I look for within a game and this I got. Thumbs up Total War :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not bad, it was broken at launch and that got it a bad rep so no one really payed attention to it even when they fixed it. Campaign map is huge though, good for darthmod or empire total factions (I think thats the name of the mod). Multiplayer is eh kinda dead and a bit broken, Extreme range rifle units, Nuclear howitzers, And Light dragoons that are more accurate than infantry... But if you get good you will ignore these things. Although i dont think the game is worth it at 20.00$. Buy Napoleon Total War if you like multiplayer. Its 15.00$ With a bigger online community left thanks to Youtubers like robinhoodgaming, and a bit smaller but more detailed campaign map. Darthmod also works better on Napoleon Total War. But i will still reccomend this game to people who want a long term campaign, you can dominate The Early Americas, The Middle East, India, And of course Europe.			",54,5,0,6,5,0,6

												Fun world domination. Once the wars get old or slow, just overwhelm and auto resolve combat. Take a weak nation, and eventually own all of Europe, the Americas, Noarth Africa, Middle East, Russia, and India. Lots of infrastructure upgrades. Making allies, keeping them, dealing with enemies, and the killing allies is what this game is about. Diplomacy, War, Nation Building, and Strategy. Great all around, until you finally beat it, or take over most of the world. After that, it sits in your libraru untouched like most other games.			",38,5,0,12,7,0,8

												This is a good strategy game, but for those of you who've not played any total war games previously, I recommend playing the game on easy mode. This is because there are a lot of faction who are able to gang up on you.This game allows you to pick a faction and command their army. You can create a larger economy, and thus a bigger army to expand your operations.You are able to partake in diplomatic relations to create trade deals and allies. Alternatively, you can use this feature to bribe your way out of 'sticky' situations, or you can even use it to declare war on another faction.I would give this game a 7 and a half out of 10.The above score would be higher if there were not a few flaws within this game, such as the unbalanced auto-resolve feature, and a few other things I can't be bothered to remember.

												It's different than other TW games, but it's a refreshing change. Guns don't make the game less exciting, as some argue; instead, they require a change of tactics. Playing in the colonial era can actually be quite fun. The graphics are an improvement, though they aren't great, but in this kind of game, I prefer gameplay over visuals. The gameplay is great - the world is gigantic, there is a new building system that makes building multiple structures simultaneously possible, there is a technology and philosophy research area, there are gentleman, naval battles where you can actually control your ships (I don't enjoy these much, though they look nice), there is North America and some of South America, and India (which we only got a glimpse of in Alexander!) There are many playable factions, and you can even unlock the American Indian factions by purchasing the Warpath DLC (this, again, requires a drastic change in strategy from the main ETW game, so buyer beware; it's probably also the only DLC worth buying, and only for a few bucks). Oh, and there's also the good ole US of A, which can be played in a campaign tracing the nation's development from a few settlers in Jamestown to an independent but vulnerable republic at the turn of the century. A few cons: the game is a bit glitchy, battles usually take place in boring forts that all look the same instead of cities, cannon have limitless ammo (could be a pro), game can get slow with the sheer number of factions at the end of every turn.The game came out very unfinished, but it's been polished up and is now defnitely worth buying for any TW fan.

												First of all, GREAT GAMEIt all goes like this- Play as a nation of your choice, become a good diplomat, and most of all, CONQUER!!Compared to Napoleon Total War, Empire basically is just right about at the same era, but has more options.3 Theatres, Americas, Europe, India. With that amount of land to conquer, better prepare ye'r armies. Also the option to choose between to periods- Early (1700-1799) and Late (late 1700s to mid 1800s). The amount of time available is just enourmous. To sum it up all, GREAT GAME.10/10, such game, much gameplay, make enemies.			",18,0,0,1,7,0,8

												Good game with a unique trading system. Campaign map gameplay feels smooth and easy, with enough micro- and macromanagement to keep you entertained for a while. Combat however, is often awkward with non-responsive or slow responding troops, and sieges are a downright pain at times. Darthmod is a must-have, since it fixes a lot of battles. Naval battles are fun and rewarding, although they tend to get too messy and clustered when fighting with a large fleet against an equally large fleet. All in all, the game has many new and unique options never seen in gaming before, and I'd recommend trying it out if you like strategy games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is definately the best of the ,,Total war´´-Games,playing in 18th and 19th century..It also beats its successor,which is playing in the napoleonic conflicts,as i would say..After playing more than 180 Hours for now,i can really recommend this game,as one of the best strategy-games,which are available at all..It's very dynamic in its battle-system,on land,or at sea,despite the fact,that the naval battles are sometimes a bit clumsy in the handling of the ships,but there are many types of weather and circumstances at sea battles,which are not just looking phenomenal,they are also taking influence in the ongoing of the battle..Such,you are in a great advantage,if the wind is blowing in the back at your sail for example,because you can start firing earlier, and you are also faster at all..But the Battles on Land are even the most impressive in that game,because they are providing a lot of opportunities mostly,by hiding units in forests,or just from distance to the enemy,if there's fog..The enemy is- And that's something which seems to be a very sheldom phenomene in Video games- Also able to gather tactical and strategical advantages,not just in superior manpower,but also in the experience and abilities of their Regiments and commanders. Also,the cavalry units of the enemy aren't just ordered into a wholeunit of pikemen,as they are now in Rome II..In Land battles,the infantry is,as in realisitc circumstances too,the Fundamental might of any army,providing the highest power,the most dynamic combat and abilities,and- of course-taking the most casaulties..As historical correctly (which is not the use in this game,as you can see as soon as the game starts,such as Sweden for example,is suddenly allied(!) with russia,during the time of the great nordic war,such as Great Britain can be played in 1700 (Founded in 1707) etc.), the Infantry regiments are mostly formed out of 160-200 Men,armed with muskets. The musket firing distance is also very realistic,and goes up to 70-100 meters at maximum,if fired by the line-infantry..Some units,armed with rifles,not with muskets,are useful by up to about 120 Meters in this game..Of course,any circumstances in battle are also taking influence onto the fighting spirit of the soldiers,which could also be enforced by elite units nearby,such as the general staff..Rainy weather causes Malfunctions of the muskets,because of an ineffectivity of gunpowder etc..It's a very time intensive,but then again,a great game,even despite the fact,it's not historically accurate at all.Depending on,which era you want to play in,i really recommend this game and its successor,which is ,,Napoleon:Total war´´.

												Despite having major issues in the begining, crashing, bugs etc, I really enjoyed playing this game. Like the other Total War games it has a mix of a turn based campaign map where you build up your Cities, Towns, Infrastructure and strategicaly move your troops. Real-Time battles from Open Fields and Seiging Forts to Sea Battles with fleets of heavy first rate ships of the line.Still the game has issues but they can be looked past, because who doesn't love conquering enemy nations with several ""stacks of doom"".Pros :Game looks great on high graphics settings.Sound is Great.Great Ship battles with a veriety of ships.3 different Continents to conquer - Americas, Europe and India.Large open fields to fight on with large army's.Historical Battles.Able to save presets for troop selection (Multiplayer and custom battles).Different victory conditions.Multiplayer, though you don't really see any games on it any more (luckily all the achievments are soloable against the AI).Cons : Diplomacy needed alot more work, AI can be completely stupid when it comes to the negotiations asking for rediculas things.AI on open field battle needed a bit more work, but its not really noticable here when your having fun slaughtering them all lol.The battle results - Heroic victory etc displays wrong.Poorly Optimized for AMD Graphics cards because its sponsored by Nvidia.Kill 1 million enemies Achievment... ugh this is 1 boring grind, 400+ hours and I haven't hit 200k kills yet.My advice is to wait for when it's on sale but it's still too good of a game to wait for that :P			",219,50,0,50,11,0,33

												Epic! That's what this is. I've been playing it for years and haven't finished with it yet. Each faction has it's own little differneces that make it interesting enough to replay as each one. The scale of the game is enormous and it can become 'trying' late game in between loading screens. But that doesn't detract from the overall good points about it. Possibly not a title for 1st time Total War players as there's an awful lot to get your head round. Great game.			",22,2,0,2,10,1,21

												Empire quickly became my favorite strategy game over all.  I loved the details that went into the rendering of units, technologies and especially the accuracy of how those techs were used on the battle maps.  Naval combat is a particular love of mine.  I am a history major and love maritime history as well.  Being able to actually control the ships in line combat looks amazing,runs smoothly usually and is so much fun!If there is a real problem it is the AI.  Diplomacy makes no sense really when a nation like the Maratha Confederacywill declare war on England for no reason that I can see.  In battles sometime the AI will move troops for no reason, it makes the battles a lot easier at times but does loose a bit to the challenge factor. Over all Empire is my favorite game in the series and I hope everyone has a change to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,7

												""Wenn es funktioniert funktioniert es gut"" hat jemand im Forum über dieses Spiel geschrieben und dem kann ich mich eigentlich nur anschließen. Das Spiel machte sehr lange sehr viel Spaß und steht seinen vorgängern in nichts nach. Die vielen Neuerungen, die es bei den Vorgängern (RomT W oder Medieval 2 TW) noch nicht gab sind nicht nur eine willkommene Abwechslung für alle Fans der Total War Reihe sondern sie machen das Spiel auch wesentlich anspruchsvoller und komplexer. Da fällt es dann kaum noch auf das ab und zu die Grafik beginnt zu flattern, einzelne Einheiten im Kampf an einer Wand hängenbleiben wodurch das gesammte Regiment nahezu handlungsunfähig wird oder der Kampf in zeitlupe schneller abläuft als mit normaler geschwindigkeit weil das spiel in dieser zu stark rukt (selbst auf PC´s die die Anforderungen übertreffen). Das einizige was den Spielspaß wirklich schmällert sind die Abstürze und teilweise nicht ladbare Speicherstände. Dennoch ein gelungenes Spiel.			",79,33,3,22,16,1,33

												if you enjoy history around 1700-1800 get this game. Sweden and ottoman empire is a little OP in multi-player but you can find a weakness in every faction. Poland is a cool faction to play with in the grand campaign and of course Britain and France have the most to do. England is the best to play with on the hardest difficulty because you have to fight on 3 fronts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game offers a substantial amount of content, however the product is in all ways underwhelming. It is quite obvious that the game had much more potential that was left uncapitalized on. Having played both Empire and Napoleon Total War, it is apparent that Empire would have, could have, and should have had the overall polish and refinement of battlefield controls that were found in Napoleon. As a whole, both games are rather enjoyable, however I would suggest Napoleon Total War instead, for fans who are significantly more interested in the battlefield experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only two bad things in my opinion:1) EVERY single unit looks the ♥♥♥♥ing same. No difference in uniform design unless it's a special unit that belongs to a certain country (Example: Death Head Hussars from Prussia) Every single line infantry, artillery crew, cavalry, grenadier, almost every light infantry unit has the SAME design but different coloring. Examples: Russian line infantry get green with red and France gets blue with white and the Dutch get blue and orange. No uniform design variety, I think they got lazy or just didn't give a ♥♥♥♥.2) Compared to artillery in Napoleon Total War the artillery in this game is almost so useless it'll make you cry. It's almost like the cannon crews don't even want to try they are just like ""just load it and fire it at their general direction so we look busy while we play cards""Besides that it is a pretty more than decent game, I'd suggest playing this before you play Napoleon Total War8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably my favorite total war game of all of them.  I think I've logged the most hours on it at least.  I really like the scale of the game, in that it gives you such a large area of the world to work with.  The trading system works really well, also.  The main downside to this game are the naval battles.  I was hoping for some epic naval clashes, but the mechanics of navy battles just plain don't work well.  You're better off leaving it to autoresolve.			",66,6,3,17,14,0,38

												Contender for my favorite game of all-time, as well as one of the best strategy games in recent memory.I've been playing TW games since the first Shogun, so I can honestly say it's the most diverse, comprehensive & immersive TW made.The only thing I was hesitant about were the naval battles, but I soon found out that their steep learning curve was WELL worth it. Every battle could potentially be Hollwood-caliber fare. If you think the idea of taking a nation and blazing a path of glory through the three main theaters of the world, (North America, Europe & India), is appealing, go for it.Instant buy.NOTE: I suggest you get Darthmod Empire for an even better, more realistic experience.

												Total War is a war simulation. It uses a great turn based world mechanics (but simple) to build your towns and armys then goes into a Real Time battle (with pause cabalities).The thing people will tell you about this game is the the Battles are the single best part of the game, they aren't lying. Being able to deploy 10,000 of units and tactically plan how to get around your enemies defence (or how to deal with there offence) is amazing. The sounds and movements really sets the stage of epic strategy game.Personally I prefer the middle age varieties of the Total War series. That is the major decsion to be made about this game. I highly recommend this game but by the version of the game in the ERA you are most intrested in for the most satsify experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												That game don't have the best opinion in Total War fans community, but truth is that was breakout in TW. First part with real border and reinforcments system. Entire region counts due to need to defend/atack factories on it ect. Of course first TW with naval warfare. Battles are really tactic , you need to learn how to use and control your units properly because if you just right click to atack it will coust you. And first time we got almost global map/maps. Between that is enormous amount of bugs, non realistic things or just stupid things like diplomacy and battle AI. But.. most of it you can solve by instaling proper mods - a lot of them, a lot of reading and work to get your bundle working but when you finish you got realy good strategy. And that is why i'm, recomending Empire. Napoleon is even bettert but lack of mods there and map with few BIG empires for me don't give that gameplay i like.			",128,15,3,30,10,2,22

												Only two bad things in my opinion:1) EVERY single unit looks the ♥♥♥♥ing same. No difference in uniform design unless it's a special unit that belongs to a certain country (Example: Death Head Hussars from Prussia) Every single line infantry, artillery crew, cavalry, grenadier, almost every light infantry unit has the SAME design but different coloring. Examples: Russian line infantry get green with red and France gets blue with white and the Dutch get blue and orange. No uniform design variety, I think they got lazy or just didn't give a ♥♥♥♥.2) Compared to artillery in Napoleon Total War the artillery in this game is almost so useless it'll make you cry. It's almost like the cannon crews don't even want to try they are just like ""just load it and fire it at their general direction so we look busy while we play cards""Besides that it is a pretty more than decent game, I'd suggest playing this before you play Napoleon Total War8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 This game is between Medieval 2 and Shogun 2, it has some similarities between bot of them.so ill mention the good and the bad.I like to mention the key difference between the TW games whit this one and that is gunpowder, almost all units are ranged, that means that melee combat takes a backseat, and you need to properly position your troops in shooting lines in order to achieve victory and not let your flanks fail, also artillery is very important now.THE GOOD1-Three theater to play in, Europe,America and India and 4 trading regions.2-The ability to expand on another theaters whit factions that never established overseas empires(Sweden Poland)3-Very different way to battle than the rest of total war games. if you play whit a melee mind you will fail here.4-Factions attitude towards you and knowing why some factions doesnt like you is my favorite part of the game.(before i used to go crazy not knowing why some factions hated me etc etc)5-Different goverment system Republic, Contitutional Monarchy and Absolute Monarchy.(some factions may like your or hate you if they are of the same or opposed goverment type)6-Different types of religion.Hinduism,Islam,Catholic,Protestan,Animisn and Sikhism(although i dont know why there Sikh there no main factions that has the religion,only a minor one and it appears if it rebels in punjabi region)7-Emergent factions, this factions appear in certain regions if they rebel in their cities(example or if you eliminate the mayor faction in their main theather for example Spain. if you eliminate Spain on Europe their territories in the americas will divide into 3 factions Mexico,Gran Colombia,Pirates, or if said destroyed factions conquered some territory they will revert back to their original owners.8-Minor factions add a whole new level of diplomacy and there are quite a few of them.Although they rarely expand.9-The researh tree.THE BAD0-few factions to choose from, and they feel and have the almost the same units, except Ottoman and Maratha.They should have been more Non-european factions.1-Game frezzes when you press ESC ALT.2-I finished the american campiagn and havent got the American faction yet.3-When a town is being sieged, you cant position well your troops,when they are manning the cannons,also the units tend not to shoot their enemies when below them.4-Game crashes from time to time.5-Diplomacy removed the following option, Attack this faction,Break alliance whit faction.6-Agents spawn randomly not when one needs them.(in one case i had about 10 missionarys and i dint even knew where they were)7-some regions have individual towns where they grow, intead of being regions themselfs.(example france is just one region it should have been divided up at least into 3 or 4 regions,so if you lose that region you lose a huge deal of land .8-Campaign winning conditions should be more free. for example playing as Sweden you need some regions in russia in order to win, that means that engaging in a alliance whit said faction impossible.there whould be a FREE MODE where the winning condition is just to capture territory not from some factions.9-Naval battles are not enjoyable.10-Africa theather not present,Africa would have been a very fun and nice theater to play in would have some unique factions.11-India Theather should have had more factions on it 1 or 2 more. I have to say that this game is good, but it feels like they had more ideas but they dint implement them i blame SEGA i think they pushed them into finishing quickly (you know production) the main reason i say this is beacuse of the Mughal Empire they are cited in the major factions window(all mayor factions are playable) but this one isnt playable.. but the  weird thing if they have their own unique units. Also some factions have unique units for example Scotland(emergent faction).			",5,1,0,1,3,0,16

												8/10 The gambit paid off, Total War crew. I've been a Total War player since the original Medieval: Total War release in the early 2000's and this game definitely takes a few steps in the right direction. Changing the map and ""territory"" style, atmosphere of play to include things like trade turn-by-turn trade routs and political decisions that actually affect the game (more than just how other factions see you) and adding two of my favourite things: Ship fights and technology trees! The ability to diversify your faction as you see fit is what makes this RTS so groundbreaking, and it does not at all lose the original appeal, which is killing massive amounts of your foes, on the battlefield. The different combat style of firearms as a primary means of murder is the obvious difference from any other Total War game I've yet to play, and it first the concept daunted me - I am a fan of my melee mashes, but after many, many playthroughs as various factions and on different difficulty settings, I can calmly say that this was the absolute breakthrough for the Total War franchise. If you're on the fence about RTSs or are even just a casual gamer, this title has a difficulty setting just for you, and if you're an RTS junkie you can crank up the battles and the campaign (hapiness of your people, who declares war upon whom, difficulty to make aggreements with other factions) difficulties independent of each other. This is great because if you're crap at battles, you can keep those easy while you make your foes all the more bloodthirsty and unforgiving, as well as the inverse, if you're a master tactician.

Posted: October 9, 2014
												It's hard to recommend this title simply because for 80% of what it does, you can find better elsewhere (for example Europa Universalis).The pitfalls: Campaign is rather linear due to the pre-existing diplomatic relations for each nation and the fact that almost all of them are already established empires. (Prussia is the most notable exception)You can only play as the major nations.Sometimes the Total War turn-based system can be a bit merciless for misclicks.As in all Total War games, there is little punishment for rapid expansion except for in diplomacy, which ultimately ends up being a small factor.The merits: The tech tree is nonlinear, allowing for your nation to develop in semi-unique fashion. You can focus on infantry, cavalry, artillery, navy, metalworking, farming, social equality, education, etc individually. Also, the advances you make are actually felt during war or peace (depending on the tech) so it actually feels like you are doing something meaningful.The government management can be fairly nice. Some have mentioned that you don't have as much of a personal attachment to idividual leaders as in past games, but to be fair, this isn't an rpg, and it isn't a game about world leaders. This game is focussed on the civ as a whole, but the quality of the leaders does make an impact on how your nation runs. It's a pretty good balance, imo. The special agents (rake and gentleman) have multiple functions for different playstyles. Also, you don't need to worry about manually sending diplomats to other nations. You can just talk to them.The namesake of the franchise is, however, where the game shines brightest. The warfare is engaging, meaningful, and intuitive. Strong armies are more likely to win, but with good control and leadership, a smaller force can win. It isn't up to chance either (unless you autorun battles, which you shouldn't do for important ones anyways).Since you have direct control of your forces, you don't need to worry about combat being unfair in any way, and you get to see what happens and why in the battles.This brings me to the battles: They are great. The units follow your orders in an organized manner, only stalling if you try to rush them across tough terrain and the like. The battlegrounds often give you strategic defensive points and the like such as hills, walls, even garrisonable buildings. Different ammunition, formations, and weapons are available as you advance in tech, giving you more satisfaction from research as you see your troops perform better and differently. Also, the generals aren't nearly as overpowered as in other Total War titles. They are mortal here, so you can't charge them into the enemy army alone and expect great things, and that just makes sense.			",57,16,4,14,13,0,43

												It's different than other TW games, but it's a refreshing change. Guns don't make the game less exciting, as some argue; instead, they require a change of tactics. Playing in the colonial era can actually be quite fun. The graphics are an improvement, though they aren't great, but in this kind of game, I prefer gameplay over visuals. The gameplay is great - the world is gigantic, there is a new building system that makes building multiple structures simultaneously possible, there is a technology and philosophy research area, there are gentleman, naval battles where you can actually control your ships (I don't enjoy these much, though they look nice), there is North America and some of South America, and India (which we only got a glimpse of in Alexander!) There are many playable factions, and you can even unlock the American Indian factions by purchasing the Warpath DLC (this, again, requires a drastic change in strategy from the main ETW game, so buyer beware; it's probably also the only DLC worth buying, and only for a few bucks). Oh, and there's also the good ole US of A, which can be played in a campaign tracing the nation's development from a few settlers in Jamestown to an independent but vulnerable republic at the turn of the century. A few cons: the game is a bit glitchy, battles usually take place in boring forts that all look the same instead of cities, cannon have limitless ammo (could be a pro), game can get slow with the sheer number of factions at the end of every turn.The game came out very unfinished, but it's been polished up and is now defnitely worth buying for any TW fan.

												""Wenn es funktioniert funktioniert es gut"" hat jemand im Forum über dieses Spiel geschrieben und dem kann ich mich eigentlich nur anschließen. Das Spiel machte sehr lange sehr viel Spaß und steht seinen vorgängern in nichts nach. Die vielen Neuerungen, die es bei den Vorgängern (RomT W oder Medieval 2 TW) noch nicht gab sind nicht nur eine willkommene Abwechslung für alle Fans der Total War Reihe sondern sie machen das Spiel auch wesentlich anspruchsvoller und komplexer. Da fällt es dann kaum noch auf das ab und zu die Grafik beginnt zu flattern, einzelne Einheiten im Kampf an einer Wand hängenbleiben wodurch das gesammte Regiment nahezu handlungsunfähig wird oder der Kampf in zeitlupe schneller abläuft als mit normaler geschwindigkeit weil das spiel in dieser zu stark rukt (selbst auf PC´s die die Anforderungen übertreffen). Das einizige was den Spielspaß wirklich schmällert sind die Abstürze und teilweise nicht ladbare Speicherstände. Dennoch ein gelungenes Spiel.			",79,33,3,22,16,1,33

												This is a good strategy game, but for those of you who've not played any total war games previously, I recommend playing the game on easy mode. This is because there are a lot of faction who are able to gang up on you.This game allows you to pick a faction and command their army. You can create a larger economy, and thus a bigger army to expand your operations.You are able to partake in diplomatic relations to create trade deals and allies. Alternatively, you can use this feature to bribe your way out of 'sticky' situations, or you can even use it to declare war on another faction.I would give this game a 7 and a half out of 10.The above score would be higher if there were not a few flaws within this game, such as the unbalanced auto-resolve feature, and a few other things I can't be bothered to remember.

												arguably the best of tw, over rome II.  a fantastic and utterly absorbing strategy game - the kind that makes you think about your next moves while you are supposed to be at work or talking to the inlaws about pruning their mulberry tree. if you love turn based eg civ, this is another dimension. if you don't know the tw series, this is a great first stop and will absolutely grab you. anyway, enough of wasting time talking to you. those annoying swedes are compromising my northern borders and i'm trying to get my hands on mysore.  and there's only 46 hours left in my weekend. bye.

												One of my favourite games, it is a very intreguing strategy game with some balance, however on the hardest diffuculty in the game after i have played a few campaigns i can conquer most of the world as the maratha confederacy, or just 10 territories as other nations. I like how it made the strengths of different countries realistic rather than balanced, it makes it so then there is another diffuculty scale; the nation you choose.			",114,16,0,26,16,0,40

												This game is one of the best out of the thousands of games in my lifetime that i have played with the utmost admiration. The game has a large and accurate historical reference and the land and naval battles are realistic and happy to play and linger with.The Campaign is an amazing piece of turn based combat that engulfs the player in micromanaging his armies for the development of one's empire. The large world map is high quality, convincing someone that world domination is actually within grasp.I would rate this game an 8.5/10 and is definatley a must buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Play with Darthmod Found on Total War centre (I can not recommend you not play without it as the game lacks all flavor), In the game you Create armies, diplomacy is involved and you require to manage your economy as well as political ambitions. Trade is also a factor especially in the eastern trading company in the age of exploration and Colonisitation.Generally speaking European factions have a lot more and slightly expensive guns and line infantry effective at range, poorer in hand to hand combat as the bulk of their forces as well as have to compete agaist other european powers. Compared to that of indian/middle eastern troops that have lower morale but elephants, camels and swordsmen which use more hit and run tactics with larger amies similar to native Americans that can close the gap and defeat european armies which are more costly.  There are also Spys (rakes) and Technology involves (gentlemen) who can steal, assasinate and sabotage targetsGenerals in your armies, and spies/rakes gain traits as they do more actions, Traits give permenent bonuses or negative atributes and some are quite funny like a mistress. You also have to watch how much industry you build because it effects the population and they may rebel as well as relion being involved taking a provience of another faith requires management and larger garrisons initially to make them submit and conform to your empire.Without getting to much involved there is a lot of detail in this game and I highly recommend this as probally the best total war game arguably.

												Not bad, it was broken at launch and that got it a bad rep so no one really payed attention to it even when they fixed it. Campaign map is huge though, good for darthmod or empire total factions (I think thats the name of the mod). Multiplayer is eh kinda dead and a bit broken, Extreme range rifle units, Nuclear howitzers, And Light dragoons that are more accurate than infantry... But if you get good you will ignore these things. Although i dont think the game is worth it at 20.00$. Buy Napoleon Total War if you like multiplayer. Its 15.00$ With a bigger online community left thanks to Youtubers like robinhoodgaming, and a bit smaller but more detailed campaign map. Darthmod also works better on Napoleon Total War. But i will still reccomend this game to people who want a long term campaign, you can dominate The Early Americas, The Middle East, India, And of course Europe.			",54,5,0,6,5,0,6

												Great game. I have played quite a lot of this game over the years and i have throughly enjoyed myself and still do, i always end up coming back to this game time and time again. The theatre system really helps to make your empire feel huge as it stretches several continents. The combat can get a bit boring at times when your troops just stand there exchanging fire but there is much more strategical depth to it then that. The variation of units isn't bad and with the DLC and mods there is a lot of unique units. I feel that this game has a lot of replayablity because every campaign is different and there are soo many different ways you can approach empire building, there is also a lot of depth into unit research which add new formations and equipment to you units which can change the way you play. This is one of my favorite games of all time, i definetly recommend this game if you have enjoyed any of the other total war games. But if you have played napoleon total war you might find some things lacking like having client states and less ship variation but having theatres really makes up for it in my opinion.

												Empire: Total War is one of the best strategy games on the PC which covers the time period of the 1700's. As an avid fan of the Total War series the amazing team behind Creative Assembly have never once let me down with a Total War title. I admit it took me a few hours to adapt to Empire when I first played it, but once those intitial phases of getting the feel for it had passed I couldn't stop playing it.For fans of Total War, or fans of stratergy games looking for something perhaps a little different. Empire: Total War is the title for you, especially if you have any particular interest in the historical period presented in the game.			",266,60,1,33,21,1,45

												Empire total war is like a sickly child (no offence to anyone who might have one). Of course, it's your baby and you love it, but it's just not... there, you know?Empire, even to this day, lacks polish (not the country, dangit) and there are still some absolutely ridiculous undertakings by the AI, most of which we'll get to later. But how about the pros and cons of the Vanilla game, shall we? PROS-excellent representation of 18th century warfare-the emergence of nations, such as Greece, USA and Scotland (among others) is interesting and mixes the campaign up-you may now contest in 3 theatres: America, India and Europe-The campaign map is pretty, has lots of cool features such as towns that magically spring out of the ground, and a realistic intercept feature, meaning you can't just trot by an enemy army without implications-Graphics are still ok, despite it's age-Naval battles are a very welcome introduction, and they're pulled of qute well.-Interesting tech tree-Fantastic new trading system on the campaign mapCONS-Battle AI can be gamebreaking-AI diplomacy is all over the place-Melee combat is an absolute snoozefest, and infantry charging is all sorts of broken, glitchy and weird-18th century warfare means little in unique units within the same culture. All european armies will end up looking the same, just as all native american armies are just as similar-With so much emphasis on the navy and trade, naval battles can become very frequent and very repetitive, especially in local trade theatres and against pirates-Autoresolving is broken. You can have a 1500 army come up against 80 rebel swordmen and lose 300 men. How?If you do get this game, i highly recommend DarthMod. I'm not gonna bother with the links etc. but it's definately worth a look see. The battles in Empire are underwhelming, especially with the poor AI, decision making and lack of bloodthirsty action, but DarthMod does a great job at reparing a few glaring problems as well as adding new features not only to battles, but the campaign as well. The broken AI means i give this game an overall 6/10. The campaign map is the best it's ever been, but in battle, it's lackluster. With DarthMod however, this bumbs it up to 8/10 level. Makes battles and campaign far more engaging.			",20,2,0,11,7,0,12

												This is without a doubt my favorite total war title and not just because I am a raging post-imperialist but conquering the jolly foreigner helps too.Huge map, clever new trade and diplomacy, limited but distinct units, epic land battles, new and devastatingly tricky sea battles and not to mention the grand strategy that we have come to know and love from the total war series and thats just before you mod it!I would seriously reccomend Darthmod total war, any flaws the game had are scrubbed off or made more bearable by this mod. Adding a whole new scale of land battles, innovative changes to the combat dynamic, vastly improved combat AI, even more shrewd and clever diplomacy, a huge new selection of units and a douzen other fixes this mod makes the game.

												ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME! Honestly I only bought it because of the price drop, but it is well worth the full amount. I swear this is the most fun I've had with a strategy game in a long time now. It has good aspects of games like civ, but instead of auto resolve with armies, your choices are made in battle, and even the smallest army can defeat the largest foe. It's fantastic.

												First of all, GREAT GAMEIt all goes like this- Play as a nation of your choice, become a good diplomat, and most of all, CONQUER!!Compared to Napoleon Total War, Empire basically is just right about at the same era, but has more options.3 Theatres, Americas, Europe, India. With that amount of land to conquer, better prepare ye'r armies. Also the option to choose between to periods- Early (1700-1799) and Late (late 1700s to mid 1800s). The amount of time available is just enourmous. To sum it up all, GREAT GAME.10/10, such game, much gameplay, make enemies.			",18,0,0,1,7,0,8

												By far the best total war since the original. Huge scale, big improvments to unit fighting and the time period of the units works well with this style of game play. It's much less...involved than the all melee ones. You're not constantly reogranizing formations or chasing units all over the map.			",99,7,0,17,19,1,45

												Empire Total War is an excellent addition to the Total War Series. The additions to the campaign overview are numerous and multi-faceted, and really add another dimension to the game. The relation system is much more explicitly explained, and the trade system has received an overhaul. The combat mechanics are much more measured than the melee centric focus of previous titles. Manouvering and positiong for the optimal output for fire is the name of the game here			",181,48,3,28,22,4,51

They are not laggy and run smoothly and it is also alot of fun to command an army!. There are many different things you can do on this game and it is up to you how you choose to build your empire and because of this every time you replay empire total war it is just as enjoyable as the first time you played it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of stratergy games and i would personaly rate it 9/10.			",4,0,0,2,2,0,5

												I have played Total War games for years (The original Rome and Medieval all the way to the newest Rome) I always enjoy going back and starting a new campaign in Empire Total War. I won't lie, the AI can be a little frustrating. (Especially during diplomacy) Though they can be frustrating, the scale of the game and the heat of battle blow the AI's short commings out of the water. The feature of this game that excits me the most is the scale of the world. The world is divided into three theaters, the Americas, India, and Eurpope allowing you to engage in wars in three differant parts of the world at once (both on land and sea). I strongly recomend this game for anyone who is a fan of the franchise or is looking for a 1700's/1800's strategy game.			",20,0,0,1,5,0,9

												The game offers a substantial amount of content, however the product is in all ways underwhelming. It is quite obvious that the game had much more potential that was left uncapitalized on. Having played both Empire and Napoleon Total War, it is apparent that Empire would have, could have, and should have had the overall polish and refinement of battlefield controls that were found in Napoleon. As a whole, both games are rather enjoyable, however I would suggest Napoleon Total War instead, for fans who are significantly more interested in the battlefield experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My personal favourite total war. Just the graphics combined with the era leads to explosive battles of cannons and muskets. The only critisizm I have of the game is that a lot of nations have the same troops just called something different. The best bit about this total war games is the ability to invade early 1700s Ameirca and India and the sheer vaiety of native troops that come with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Incredibly fun, intriguing, and smart. Its rated among the top strategy games of all time. You can spend hours and hours building and upgrading your empire, taking over nations, creating and managing political affairs, theres a lot to do. This game is a must play for real strategy fans.

												This game is not as good as FOTS but it is still pretty good. The patches they have been releasing for years has definitely made the game much better (though it is still prone to glitches) I had a lot of strategic fun with this game and it can go toe to toe with Shogun 2 in some aspects. If you want a more modern experience though, go with Shogun 2 FOTS. Unless if you think the 18th century is more interesting and you like line infantry combat more. Even though there is line infantry in FOTS it is a lot faster paced than in empire. ETW is a lot more like its time period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has become my favorite Total War game. No doubt it has many flaws (the least of which are technical issues, which really hamper the game at times). But IMO, with the correct Mods (i.e. Darthmod) this game is the largest in scope and really gives you the sense of controlling a world wide empire.  What makes this game so enjoyable for me is the incredible amount of variance in play throughs. Your campaign as Great Britain or The United Provinces, which sees a lot of overseas expansion, is likely going to be very different than a campaign as Austria or one of the Indian factions, which are much more land locked.  Of course, you can always mix it up and change history by taking over Europe as the Ottoman Empire, then invade and conquer the Americas. The actual battles are great as well, and again with the right mods they can actually be a challenge. t is very fun to assault an enemy position or to use the terrain to make a strong defensive position and repel enemy attacks.  I think the graphics and animations during battles are superb, even if more recent titles like Shogun 2 have improvements. As I mentioned this is my favorite Total War game, and will likely remain so as Rome 2 is a mess and I just can't bring myself to play it.			",48,2,0,10,12,0,22

												After playing this game for a few hours I rate it as one the the greatest real time strategy games of all time. Equally fun if you take a hands off approach to your battles and rely on the auto resolve funstion or take control against insermountable odds and use keen strategic placement of your troups along will real time battle manuevers to outflank and crush your foes. Varying nations have different bonuses and starting situations. A multitude of possible alliances and backstabs are possible and achieveable by various means. Placate your population with religion, sorted diversions or military presence or victories. Utilize the same to dominate a conquered populace and/or turn them in time to your loyal followers. Infiltrate opposing countries with spies, assasinate or sabatoge as you go. Send out religious emisaries to turn populations to the one true religion. Train researchers to bolster your war technology or steal/trade it from another country.  The Grand Campaign is amongst the best offered in any strategy game and was probably the best at the time the game was released. So many factions to conquer. So many alternative routes to take to world domination. Replayability is off the charts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire total war was the first game I played in the total war series. It was a good step I don't regret.Buy this game and it's DLC's on sale and you will be very impressed. If perhaps giving you a few over powered units (ahem, America goes from a milita to op army) The campaign is either a play through of the birth of the US, the leading of the major tribes in North America against colonial powers, or attempting to conquer the world as an empire as your choice.The game is a solid build with my cheap computer able to handle it well. Upgrading your pc will only upgrade your experience. modding is strong in the community. Many hours of your life will be rewarded with your armies marching through out the old and new world. There are a few glitches here and there that come with a game trying to manage a few thousand troops moving around but nothing game breaking or rage inducing. A splendid way to enter the world of Total War. 9.5/10			",63,5,1,4,31,0,18

												One of the better Total War games I've played... Started my Total War experience with Medieval Total War, then to Rome, Medieval II, Empire, Shogun 2 and Rome II... All great games, for me I would have to place this game at #2 to Medieval II Total War... Tons of content and story and endless hours or pure entertainment... I haven't even tried any of the mods yet but I'll get there when I start to feel the game is lacking as for now it's been years and they are all great games. Good luck, Happy Hunting...

I was right, the sea battles are awesome, there is a tree of technology, which you can steal from rivals, you get to conquer the new world and Iindia,or if you are not into the world domination thing, you can play as the young america, fighting for thier independace, from Great Britian.

												I really spent so many hours playing Empire: Total War because of the much more realistic economy system than any other Total War Game before (and that's what mostly really mattered between 1700 and 1800).Not only with colonization you have many options for trade with expensive goods (like coffee, tea, sugar and many more) with other colonist nations, you also can try to push up or down the price on the world market to enhance your situation.You also have minor cities with different prosperity levels besides your provincial capitals where you can focus on factories or (if it is a poor city) on churches to improve religious integrity or even brothels for a satisfied population. You may also build Universities to research technologies faster to get a positive distance to your neighbour states.All in all, Empire: Total War is a really good game and today you get it definately for 10€ or below (at least in bundles). I can recommend it to everybody who likes games that combine epic real time battles with realistic turn-based management on a campaign map!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely love this game, who would not want to take over the Americas? who would not want to watch Russia take over India? who would not want to help the maratha confederacy take over the world? Who would not want to have the chance to kill some Frence? Who would not want the chance to make trade partners for Britain? So many possibilities, it is a endless game that no one can say is boring, i loved this game more than i liked shogun 2 and napoleon total war put together ( probally because i do not like those ones ). An example of how good this game is: When i was Austria i thought expanding into the ottoman empire would be the best possibility. However i needed to expand into Germany a little first to secure my poistion. When i invaded Prussia my good friend poland- lithuania went to the aid of the Prussians and declared war on me, I did not want to take their lands however so i soon amde a peace treaty with them. Once i had taken the settlement i wanted i tried to make peace with the Prussians, they did refuse so i was forced to continue my war. However i soon realized they was not going to go through the poland - lithuania territory to get me, so i moved further into Germany territory. but soon i was stabbed in the back by the polish ( just they do now to us English ) I was forced to raise more armies to deal with tem, this caused tention between me and my western allies.  Once poland- lithuania was mine i had to invade my allies, this made more friction between me and Britain, my second best friend. Then before i got the chance to Invade the Ottoman empire ( my original plan ) The spanish declared that my monarch was not the true blood to my throne ( my kind had died leaving a Queen in charge of a country - Oh no! ) I soon invaded alsace and lorraine and paris. once they were mine i payed for a peace treaty with Spain, due to them being widespread i didn't want to wait to build strong navies. By this point Britain was nervous of my power and did not like me, even though they were still my allies. And the ottoman empire i wanted to invade loved me completely. This shows just how much the game can change over the time you play, adding to the complexity of the whole game. I know that during my European wars Britain was taking over the thirteen colonies and at war with france and spain. This made Britain more of a threat to me, since they now had a average sized amount of land in the Americas, and nce they fell in Erope i would have another potential threat over in the Americas. The guns also are brilliant to use! I often just make a army of cheap line infantry just so i can let the enemy come towards me, their cavelry always dies shortly after. My cannons ( 1 to 2 units ) always lower enemy moral before they get into my range of fire for my infantry. Then the cavelry ( 1 to 2 units ) always cover the flanks and kill the runaways at the end of the battle. Over all i can say that i really recomend this game and that anyone who does not agree that this is a brilliant game should go back to it and reconsider their choice. Sorry about this being a overly long review by the way, i hope that no one has gotten bored reading it. for anyone wanting to know more of these battle stories please join my group, t is dedicated to the total war series, we have player of the week and regular announcements and discussions. the discussions are about which faction we use in what games and more while the announcements are for planning a multiplayer campaign in advance. I believe that anyone interested in the total war series should join my group, 17 members currently ( 28 / 2 / 14 ). Yours SincerlyGiaus Julius Ceasar			",23,4,0,15,7,0,13

												Hey guys, Im a big Total war fan, take it from me this is the best game in their collection in my eyes. It offers the all round greatest features of a total war game, but plays across 3 theatres and introduces naval battles into gameplay. Along with a personalization of technologies and growth of your nation. Only downside is there is a max of 10 or so nations to choose from. My rating is a 9 outta 10 and a must have for the Stradegy gamer!!!			",33,2,0,9,16,1,13

												I absolutely love this game, who would not want to take over the Americas? who would not want to watch Russia take over India? who would not want to help the maratha confederacy take over the world? Who would not want to have the chance to kill some Frence? Who would not want the chance to make trade partners for Britain? So many possibilities, it is a endless game that no one can say is boring, i loved this game more than i liked shogun 2 and napoleon total war put together ( probally because i do not like those ones ). An example of how good this game is: When i was Austria i thought expanding into the ottoman empire would be the best possibility. However i needed to expand into Germany a little first to secure my poistion. When i invaded Prussia my good friend poland- lithuania went to the aid of the Prussians and declared war on me, I did not want to take their lands however so i soon amde a peace treaty with them. Once i had taken the settlement i wanted i tried to make peace with the Prussians, they did refuse so i was forced to continue my war. However i soon realized they was not going to go through the poland - lithuania territory to get me, so i moved further into Germany territory. but soon i was stabbed in the back by the polish ( just they do now to us English ) I was forced to raise more armies to deal with tem, this caused tention between me and my western allies.  Once poland- lithuania was mine i had to invade my allies, this made more friction between me and Britain, my second best friend. Then before i got the chance to Invade the Ottoman empire ( my original plan ) The spanish declared that my monarch was not the true blood to my throne ( my kind had died leaving a Queen in charge of a country - Oh no! ) I soon invaded alsace and lorraine and paris. once they were mine i payed for a peace treaty with Spain, due to them being widespread i didn't want to wait to build strong navies. By this point Britain was nervous of my power and did not like me, even though they were still my allies. And the ottoman empire i wanted to invade loved me completely. This shows just how much the game can change over the time you play, adding to the complexity of the whole game. I know that during my European wars Britain was taking over the thirteen colonies and at war with france and spain. This made Britain more of a threat to me, since they now had a average sized amount of land in the Americas, and nce they fell in Erope i would have another potential threat over in the Americas. The guns also are brilliant to use! I often just make a army of cheap line infantry just so i can let the enemy come towards me, their cavelry always dies shortly after. My cannons ( 1 to 2 units ) always lower enemy moral before they get into my range of fire for my infantry. Then the cavelry ( 1 to 2 units ) always cover the flanks and kill the runaways at the end of the battle. Over all i can say that i really recomend this game and that anyone who does not agree that this is a brilliant game should go back to it and reconsider their choice. Sorry about this being a overly long review by the way, i hope that no one has gotten bored reading it. for anyone wanting to know more of these battle stories please join my group, t is dedicated to the total war series, we have player of the week and regular announcements and discussions. the discussions are about which faction we use in what games and more while the announcements are for planning a multiplayer campaign in advance. I believe that anyone interested in the total war series should join my group, 17 members currently ( 28 / 2 / 14 ). Yours SincerlyGiaus Julius Ceasar			",23,4,0,15,7,0,13

												I really spent so many hours playing Empire: Total War because of the much more realistic economy system than any other Total War Game before (and that's what mostly really mattered between 1700 and 1800).Not only with colonization you have many options for trade with expensive goods (like coffee, tea, sugar and many more) with other colonist nations, you also can try to push up or down the price on the world market to enhance your situation.You also have minor cities with different prosperity levels besides your provincial capitals where you can focus on factories or (if it is a poor city) on churches to improve religious integrity or even brothels for a satisfied population. You may also build Universities to research technologies faster to get a positive distance to your neighbour states.All in all, Empire: Total War is a really good game and today you get it definately for 10€ or below (at least in bundles). I can recommend it to everybody who likes games that combine epic real time battles with realistic turn-based management on a campaign map!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire total war was the first game I played in the total war series. It was a good step I don't regret.Buy this game and it's DLC's on sale and you will be very impressed. If perhaps giving you a few over powered units (ahem, America goes from a milita to op army) The campaign is either a play through of the birth of the US, the leading of the major tribes in North America against colonial powers, or attempting to conquer the world as an empire as your choice.The game is a solid build with my cheap computer able to handle it well. Upgrading your pc will only upgrade your experience. modding is strong in the community. Many hours of your life will be rewarded with your armies marching through out the old and new world. There are a few glitches here and there that come with a game trying to manage a few thousand troops moving around but nothing game breaking or rage inducing. A splendid way to enter the world of Total War. 9.5/10			",63,5,1,4,31,0,18

												One of the better Total War games I've played... Started my Total War experience with Medieval Total War, then to Rome, Medieval II, Empire, Shogun 2 and Rome II... All great games, for me I would have to place this game at #2 to Medieval II Total War... Tons of content and story and endless hours or pure entertainment... I haven't even tried any of the mods yet but I'll get there when I start to feel the game is lacking as for now it's been years and they are all great games. Good luck, Happy Hunting...

												Total War's first foray into an age other than one of swords and bows, Empire, like much of this franchise, is a flawed gem. Being their first real go with armies that predominatly use guns, the AI work is sloppy and it really shows. It's pathetic how easy it is to expoit the AI's failings in battle and win yourself crushing victories that you shouldn't have gotten. It's also the first shot at naval combat, which functionally works better but still seems to generate complaints. Personally I blame that on a lack of knowledge about how to use warships in the age of sail in a fight more than anything else (hint: cut the enemy's battle line). Lastly, the diplomatic AI has a rather predictable habit of delivering you unpredictable war declarations. For example I was minding my own business as the French carving up North America for myself when I got war declared on me by the Marathas (India). Before too long they were landing armies in the Carribean and harassing my trade fleets. Why? I still have no idea, but it sure didn't help them when I dropped my huge armies fresh from American conquest into India. But damn was that war annoying when it started.So what's the good? The map is -huge-, and the number of choices for nations to play is considerable (Though most are European). In other words... replay value is in abundance here. And that's really all it needs, to be honest. A game like this is made for being replayed and ending up in various differing situations. And it is here that this game shines. Otherwise it's a mixed bag.What i'm trying to say is that this game is pretty decent, but you might not want this to be the first game in the series you try. It might sour your opinion and lead you to not looking into the other, arguably better or at least less flawed, entries into the series. But, this does have huge replay value. You will get alot of playtime out of this. If that's what you are looking for, then that might be all you need to have the pros of this game outweigh its problems.			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

I was right, the sea battles are awesome, there is a tree of technology, which you can steal from rivals, you get to conquer the new world and Iindia,or if you are not into the world domination thing, you can play as the young america, fighting for thier independace, from Great Britian.

												Empire Total War is a wonderfully addictive game. The campaign is very well made and will soak up hours of your life as you try to dominte the entire world. You have many factions to choose from.  The battles are very fun, particuarly online, but are alot different then non gunpowder total wars. They seem a bit slower and less engaging. Still its very fun. Though not my fav TW game, I promise you it will entertain you for a long while. Especially if you like the time period.All in all I give this game a 7/10			",8,1,0,0,0,0,7

I have recently brought Napoleon and even though it's not as fun and i don't play it as much.

												Being my first Total War game, I love the RTS aspects of this game, but is best shown in the actual skirmish battles on land, I mean sea is fun but somewhat confusing with intricate controls. The scale of battles with hundreds of troops under your command is amazing, playing it on PC is really addicting but now that I find that it is available on Mac I question the decision to lessen troops in each unit group. I mean really from 120 units in a group to 40? That is just strange to me and I hope that the Mac version can live up to the Windows version.			",159,24,6,18,16,0,39

												Here are a few reasons why you should get this game. firstly, it`s on sale. 50% Off. It can run on low end computers too, so don`t be worried that you will have problems. This game requires strategy. This isn`t another Call of Duty Game. Because if you use Call of Duty tactics, those brave horsemen on your team will be lying dead on the ground in no time. SO whatever you do, think logically. (e.g. Bringing ranged soldiers into close quarters combat). If you like startegy games that pay off for every action that is sucessful, I think this will become a great addition to your Steam Library, like it is for me :)Happy Gaming!			",36,0,1,3,6,2,4

You control the empires economy and military and research and you choose who to declare war on or who to make peace with. Any of the battles that your nation is in you can play and control your men.   :)			",5,0,0,1,3,0,5

												If you've never played a Total War game, don't start with this one.Total War has always consisted of two parts: the turn-based overland map, and the real-time battles, and I'll adress each separately:Overland Map: Unlike every other Total War game, there isn't one overland map, but several.  This game covers the globe, and has the most complex turn-based portion of any Total War game, with the most details.  The complexity approaches that of a dedicated strategy game, but the Total War style does not lend itself well to that level of complexity, and it can be quite overwhelming for those who don't want to micro-manage their empire. RTS Battles: How much you like the real time battles depends on how much you like the units involved.  If you're a fan of muskets and cannons, this is game delivers in spades.  If not, then this game isn't for you.  The artillery/gunpowder based battles play out differently than other Total War games, and for those who want more of the same, you should probably play a different game.To sum up: if you don't want artillery/gunpowder based battles, you should play a different Total War game.  If you want artillery/gunpowder based battles, but you don't want a complex overworld map, play Napoleon Total War instead.  If you want a complex overworld map, but aren't particularly interested in the battles, get a different strategy game (such as Europa Universalis or Civilization).  But if you want great artillery based battles and a (overly-) complex overworld, this is the game for you.			",309,110,13,40,35,6,70

												Empire Total War is a great Strategy game. I've been playing this game for many years now and still believe it to be one of the better games in the Total War series.Whilst it lacks the political or economic fidelity of later Total War games such as Rome II (which itself has it's own problems I won't elaborate on), or the direct focus on real time military strategy like its successor Napoleon Total War, Empire Total War manages to expertly balance both the turn based and real time strategy the Total War franchise is loved for.This is not to say the game is flawless. Glitches in the real time battles do occur and can be frustrating, especially I've found with defending during sieges. Likewise the AI don't necessarily play smarter at high difficulties, but seem to instead just be immediately more aggresive and gang up on you at the start of the game, which can make playing a smaller nation that plays the long game as opposed to early expansion (i.e. the Dutch) quite frustrating.However in the grand scheme of Empire Total War these complaints are relatively minor. Not many games are truly dictated solely by a players ambition, but Empire is one of those games. If you're bold enough and have the strategic and fiscal skills to back it up you can take a smaller empire like the Dutch or Marathans and forge an empire, and having my Polish Hussars spreading out to the Americas and India after crushing the European powers was a nice bit of irony compared to real historical events. It's nice to be able to set your mind to doing something unexpected and, whilst being challenged, be motivated to finish it off regardless of the absurd amount of time it will take due to how much fun you're legitimatly having.Empire Total War is an awesome game and I would gladly recommend it to any gamer out there who simply wants to set their mind to something and do it however ridiculous it may seem.

Also it's sucessor Napoleon is a great game but this game offers some great mods and different timeline(playstyle).I recommend it a lot, and if you are taking a hate for CA about them being a DLC ♥♥♥♥♥ it's your profit for buying and playing ther older games especially now they are cheap.The only problem would be the not so great Campaign AI.

												Fantastic infantry/cavalry/artillery/naval programming, I throughrougly enjoyed the grand campaign multiple times, and playing custom battles on both land and sea. Sadly the enemy AI appears quite basic, either you can run rings around them, or they relentlessly attack. The game is plagued by small bugs and glitches left in. It's heartbreaking because so many look fixable, as if SEGA just forced Creative Assembly to make 'Napoleon: Total War' rather than fix 'Empire: Total War'. This leaves Empire as a flawed experience. The worst issue seems to be a memory leak, reducing frame rates massively. This doesn't stop Empire from being a playable game massive in scope, and owning a big reputation.			",328,38,37,15,49,2,50

												This is a really good Total War game. It is more up to date than Medieval II (good game) and playes much better than Napoleon or Shogun II. Shogun II runs badly and has balance issues, whereas Napoleon has few enemies (although those few enemies have large territories.)You get to perform research in Empire. I do wish the research tree was larger for Battle and Economic areas. It is very large on Philosophy. The units are nice. All three arms of the military, infantry, cavalry and artillery, are equal in this time period and thus all three types of units have a role on the battlefield. Having a good mix of these works really well.Generals can be appointed easily and troops can move and attack without generals.Trading is neat. Diplomacy works well too.Ship battles are cool.Anyway, this is a good Total War title. I had no problems getting the game to run in Win 7 64-bit. Good game. ",34,3,1,4,7,1,16

												This game is a great game, with or without the DLCs. It's fun and enjoyable for the newer players of the Total War genre however it may deem unworthy or boring for the more experienced players due to the lack of realism and the lack of political involement which I dearly loved in Total War Rome II. Moving on, the graphics are not too shabby and ranges from okay to bearable, it did not bother me. Sadly the main problem with game is that it gets a tad too repetitive, after playing and dominating the world with France, Russia and Britain, I found myself unable to play again due to it's repetitive nature. However this review is solely my opinion and wish for no man or woman to take to much to heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't care what anyone says... 370 hours in and this is still my favorite strategy game.  Very ambitious and beautifully realised.  Sure it has a couple bugs here and there, but a game of this one's scale and complexity there's bound to be couple, but they're small niggles.  This game caters to both RTS and TBS players.  And is one of the few games I've played where having the biggest army doesn't always determine the winner.  It's how intelligently you play the game.  How you use your surroundings.  Which units you use, where you use them and how use them that determines the tide of battle.  A game worth any strategy gamers time to try at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've read some terrible reviews of this game- people saying that it's the low point in the series, but I loved it. I thought the theatres of operations idea was great, as were the naval battles. Trade is more important than ever and Allies ACTUALLY HELP YOU. Plus, economic and social development are fun, especially with the town system.But...The game doesn't really offer you a challenge. In rome on hard difficulty, everyone attacks you. On this- nope. The AI tactics are broken or non-existent, predictable and easy. Besides, the map looks horrible compared to rome. Also, the ottoman troops are automatically worse than the europeans. Besides, I don't like the fact that all the american indians and the mughals are locked out in campaign.Overall- fun but not the best of all the TW games.			",2,0,0,1,1,0,13

												The game is a blast, wonderful game. But I suppose I didn't understand that the Multiplayer Campaign mode was a beta project that was given up on and no longer available. Spend and hour and a half trying to figure out the problem until I messaged the ""Sega Key page"" for information in which they responded ""The keys are no longer available"" In which later I realized that there isn't even a MP Campaign in the game. I actually tried the game on a friend's computer a year after it's release and it was outstanding, now that the game's price was lowered for the holiday, I purchased it. But I guess it simply wasn't what I thought it would be. However from previous experience, this game is definitely recommended, that is, if you know for fact there are no multiplayer campaigns. Just battles and a singleplayer campaign mode.			",49,1,0,2,3,0,0

												This is a very good total war game, a lot better than some of the more recent ones. It's very grand and vast in design. There are problems, which every total war game has, but I think that they can be sometimes exagerated. If you get the Darthmod with this game, then you are in for a great time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russia backs Poland, France backs Austria, England backs me, Spain backs France, Ottomans back England , and Swedens already at war with half of us.

												If you're a sucker for 18th century warfare then this is the definitive game for you. Conquer, annihilate and rule as you build up your nation and its armed forces, trying to stay one step ahead of your adversaries both technologically and economically. Change history, why not make a Swedish colonial empire? Or a Russian North Africa? Perhaps conquer India as Prussia, all of these are scenarios which you can play out in Empire: Total War.This is my all time favourite strategy game, and for the absolute ultimate experience, it should be played with DarthMod. The game is not without its faults however, the campaign AI might declare war on you even though you have excellent relations with that particular country, the battle AI isn't always the smartest. Regiments won't fire unless every single man has fallen into formation, if even one man is stuck behind a tree a hundred yards away and the enemy is marching on them, they will not fire unless the last man is present in formation.All in all, if you like this era of history or even have just a slight interest in it, then I recommend this game strongly.

												Not the very best of the series. Had the disadvantage of being the first of the change that occured in the TW franchise. Most of the time, it felt like a beta of Napoleon Total War, a game that should be part of a larger Empire Total War and not seperate. Anyways, the new game mechanics (of that time) caused a few problems, at the beginning, for the experienced R:TW and M2:TW players (or older) but, eventually, we got used to it.I'm posting this critic right now 'cause it's sales time. So, someone might be interested in buying it. For a cheap, nice price, give it a try or have it, if you can afford it, as a cosmetic thingy in your Games-section.No matter its (many) problems, still, to this day, remains a game I'll always remember.

												Conquer the world!!!!!! I love Total War, and this is the best Total War yet (well, Rome Barbarian invasion does give it a bit of a run for it's money but not as many things explode in that so...)Anyway, if you think the $20 it costs to buy this game is better suited to gathering dust in you're wallet, you're an idiot. Plain and simple, i said it. Unless you're a hobo, then it's kind of an obligation to buy this game, because to be honest, the only excuse NOT to make the purchase RIGHT NOW, is that you're afraid you'll overdose on awsomeness after playing it for any period of time (if that DOES happen, just close the game, take deep breaths, and delete some of you're best save files, because believe me, too much Awsomeness in one day can lead to a serious Total War addiction).

												Conquered all of india and the middle east as the Martha Confederacy while simultaneously donating 100's of thousands to the Cherokee Nation. Conquered Saudi Arabia in 1744 and gave it to the Cherokee Nation. Cherokee Nation has now conquered all of the Middle East and is thriving. The 13 colonies tried to take their home area so I captured Florida, gave it back to the Cherokee Nation, and the 13 colonies voted to leave everyone alone. Britain then requested an alliance against the 13 colonies so I attacked them, captured all of thier territory, and gave it to the Cherokee Nation. Cherokee Nation for a world power in 1799. 10/10 would save my people again.			",10,3,0,9,1,0,4

												Yes, its bugged and can glitch, but...It's another cracking game which, like Medieval TW, is another game in the TW franchise that has stood the test of time although it plays very differently because with the advent of gunpowder it rewards a more measured approach in combat than MTW. The introduction of naval combat also adds a new twist. And the campaign length makes it an absolute time sink.To improve gameplay I would start by investing time at Total War Center, though I would use judiciously to avoid reducing the challenge of learning the intricacies of the game and successful country strategies. I would also definitely make use of mods although the use of them should come with a government health warning if you want to have a life. Make the game more difficult? Load DarthMod.  More atmosphere in battles? Load Blood and Smoke. More units? Load Additional Units Mod. New campaigns? Load the American Revolution. Late period? Load 1800. Early period? Load Colonialism 1600. Want to play a minor faction? Load Total Factions. Its all there waiting for you, only a mouse click away. Go on. You know you want to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cool,isn't it?..So if i didn't conviced you yet watch videos of the game you're going to be ....This is my best game EVER!(If you'd like to play online battles with me feel free to send a friend request) ",139,23,3,20,9,0,21

The game has many pros and cons, just like any other. - Pros-Large scale battles-Graphics aren't too outdated-The game is historically accurate-Great roleplay value-Great replay value-Large choice of nations to be in the campaign-Some great mods out there-Realistic- Cons-Sometimes stupid ai, the men sometimes just stand there while the enemy is in range, getting slaughtered-Not very friendly to new players of Total War-Micromanaging cities in the campaign is annoyingOverall, Empire: Total War is a great game and I am planning on buying Napoleon (because people say it's better).

This game is one of the most addictive games I probably have ever played. At first the amount of depth that's in the game seems overwheling but before you know it you are worrying about the econmy and politics. This game just blows my mind.

												Empire Total War is far the best out of the series in my opinion.I mean not the vanilla,but with the DarthMod you can reach every undeveloped part of the game which is very nice itself,but overall this,you will have a free expansion for the game.By this i mean you will be able to play with the minor factions which  are in the vanilla game but you can't acces to it.How cool is to conquer the whole game world with buccaneers? Cool,isn't it?..So if i didn't conviced you yet watch videos of the game you're going to be ....This is my best game EVER!(If you'd like to play online battles with me feel free to send a friend request) ",139,23,3,20,9,0,21

												To be honest empire total war is a very hard game to master. I have started many campaigns and failed at them, since I am a medieval 2 total war player I tend to make big armies and rush but empire is not like that so that is hard for me. You have to manage ministers, government, taxes, research technology, and much more! I think this game is also complex because there are now naval battles and boy are those fun. Overall it's a complicated total war that requires a lot of skill to play and so I like it. 8/10			",21,2,0,0,1,0,3

												Good game.Not the best Total War but definetly the one which was the breavest.Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.—Will RogersSo let's beginEmpire Total War is the 5th part of the Total War franchise. (if we don't count the Standalone Barbarian Invasion).The game  was released on 4 March 2009 by the Creative Assembly and Sega. It is a (less dificult) Grand Strategy and RTS hybrid. We will controll one from the 11(+USA) factions who fight for the total controll of the world in the 18th century.THE PLAYABLE FACTIONS in the grand campaign are: Britannia , Austria, France, Maratha Conf (it is an indian empire)., Ottoman Empire, Poland-Lithuania, Prussia, Russia, Spain, Sweden, United Provinces (Netherlands)We also have a little ""Campaign"" (toturial) mode where we can look trhough the more important keystonse of the USA ( Honestly I never played it trhough).  Graphicks: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Voice and gameplay sounds: 9/10Music: 10/10Pros: The gunpowder makes the Total War experience even better.  So much factions, no rebels!!! Playable seabattles.All in all many new and well developed features (rechearches, new dimloamcy and religion system and so on...) Cons: A.I. is not the best (sometimes they are geniuses and sometimes they are like some brainded zombies)Sea Battles are very hard to controll. Graphics could be better (the graphic engine is not bad and the effects are also fine but the animations get worse if you zoom in ).Final Verdict: 8.5/10 very good game; must have for strategy/history/Total War fans.

												Probably the first great game to me that introduced the Enlightenment era in gaming. Although I am not crazy about the campaign. I really enjoy the combat. Forcing your mind to focus on the battle and be weary of your enemies. I would recommend this game to anyone. But, I would like to see this game get a remake sort of like Napoleon: Total War.

												Empire Total War was massive. It was the first RTS that let you actually play out the gigantic battles you read about in history class. Few things can top the feeling of a well-planned flank, with horsemen running through massive battalions of enemy forces. That, or you could play strategic, and never actually fight a battle. EMPIRE: Total War let you do that, and it worked marvelously.			",695,78,29,62,87,9,129

Not to mention the fierce Ottoman Empire Authentic and detailed naval battles and simulation for those classic wooden, sail, and cannon warships used in the 18th centuryActive multiplayer communityPlenty of interesting and relevant quotes in the loading screens; loading screens are beautiful tooGraphics still hold up for a 2009 game  Though, the AI runs away constantly in the Warpath campaign, and siege battles become redundant as the AI won't utilize the walls. Also note, some people like to spam artillery and light dragoons and light infantry, resulting in hit and runRecommend at base price or bundles that include all the DLC			",118,21,0,14,50,3,88

												Honestly, this is my favorite Total War. It''s' bug ridden, it has issues and problems like all Total War games do but it just has charm. Sure, Napoleon did almost everything better EXCEPT scope and scale. I really like how you can conquer India and have colonies in South America. Create trade lanes and have to protect them. of course the AI is half brain dead but still. Maybe it's nostalgia, in fact it's most likely nostalgia as I've put a lot of time into this game at critical moments in my life but heck, on sale right now it's $5. You're going to get your money worths.			",296,21,5,30,46,2,95

												For all who are suckers at dominating the world should try this.It takes quite amount of time to fully comprehend Empire: Total War for new players like myself.There's the battle map where battles takes place (no kidding) and there's the diplomatic map (i think) where every else falls. Where you do you reaseach, where see the general layout of the world and movement of troops & agents.There's alot to learn in the diplomatic map but once you understand the dynamics of what makes an empire tick or fall then thats when the real fun sets in.There's no point in winning battles against you enemies when your people are not happy, because the worst enemies are from within you empire.

												This review is mainly concerning multiplayer. I have played Empire, Medieval 2, and Napoleon. I played the demo of Rome 2.Three reasons why Empire is the best TW game that I have played:1. I find the gunpowder warfare far more interesting strategically than the tactics of other TW games.2. Compared to Napoleon, the nations in empire are more balanced. Personally I prefer the micro mechanics of Empire and how there is a clearer view of the battle.3. In its current state, the game has relatively few flaws compared to when it was released.*I have not played Shogun 2 so I am not able to compare Empire to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A step forward for the series, Empire still has some rathe obvious flaws that play-testing would have easily highlighted, including a lack of Swiss nation or even region and the insistance that some nations are Major and some Minor, that a single state United States is more important to the two state Venetians is sad.  The DLC is pointless and overpriced, the game insists on a very European-centric perspective and the game does crash occasionally, but it is worth buying when on sale.			",639,233,20,109,60,5,149

												It's my favorite Total War of the ones I have. (Shogun 2, Rome II).I love the muitiplayer the most. It's so fun going in, not knowing what the enemy will do, and hoping you can read his mind and set up ahead of time, maybe try to trick him by hiding units in trees and as he comes marching through just killing them all. It's so fun being in a 30 minute standstill not wanting to move up and just eating pizzaa waiting for him to give in and move up. Then he surprises you and you start to think your going to lose. But than you have a trick up your sleev with 4 units hiding in trees... As your skims and your 6 line fight the battle, and most are almost dead, and he has qquite a lot aliv, you surprise him. And you somehow win with only 3 skirms left (all with less 40 men) and 1 line left with like 70 guys. It's the best feeling ever when you still win against 3 elite units... And you just wonder how.....			",35,2,0,1,8,0,8

												Bought this game when it first came out. It constantly crashed so I gave up. Reinstalled it again after seeing it was on sale in Steam. Figured it would be patched up to make the game reliable. Jumped into a quick battle, game crashed 10 mins into it.I promptly uninstalled it. Pathetic really to still have stability issues so long after release.			",68,14,3,10,14,0,6

												i tried it during the free weekend(~10h), but have intensively(~400h) played medieval2:total war back in the hardcopy days.Campaign Map: The decentralized buildings are kind of a good addition, but now you have to scan the huge building lists to find that college for research you want to upgrade. just look at the map then, i thought(being austrian graz and innsbruck are nearby IRL) but spent 2 mins searching, just clicking on farms or enemy cities or whatever buildinglike thing.Battlefield: Battles are so slow, even sluggish. As relaxing as warfare can be from another perspective. But even on max time compression you spend at least 5mins per battle just looking at your marching troops or sailing ships. The AI is worse than almost 15years ago in M2TW, no joke here... My unexperienced line infantry(or was it even just militamen?) Defended that Farmhouse like gentlemen of true standing, Slaughtering over a thousand enemy soldiers and forcing the enemy !general! to retreat. What a glorious victory?! This took about 40mins on max time compression where you have no interaction.the ship battles are very cool. wish i understood them better, there seem to be variations in crew strength(frigate boarding a wavering sloop and loosing the battle, those 18 pirates just slaughtered ~50men(i think some of them missed the pirate ship and just jumped into the water.One last thing: The ambient noises wolfs, weather, and especially those artificial bird sounds are kinda creepy. So I settled on no sound(+advisors shut up, - you miss troop announcements like""our flanks are exposed"")			",27,1,1,9,7,0,5

												When I bought this game back in 2009 it just would not run at all, now I'm giving it another crack.  I have to say it's much an improved experience from back then and much more stable.You don't need to read about that though.  What you do need to hear about though are line infantry, cavalry charges and proper naval battles.  All work very well and make battling opposing forces a dream.  Oh and proper artillery to relieve entrenched forces of their buildings too.The campaign map is beautifully clear and well organised, simple to build up your settlements/cities too.  It's a streamlined experience compared to it's older brothers.The AI is still given to some bizarre decision making especially concerning terrain and there's been more than one occasion where enemy units have not entered the battle map correctly, leading to me not being able to attack them at all,Minor niggles aside you'll have a good time establishing your empire, especially if you love the colonial era.Quick ammendment:  The naval side of things can be quite a mess at times once you get to the larger scale battles.  The AI really doesn't know how to figure things out and the control is very cumbersome.			",17,5,0,2,1,1,13

												Favorite total war in my opinion, and I have Rome 2 and Shogun 2 also. First of all, the game feels so smooth compared to the other total wars, especially if u dont have the best computer, and theres even a Road to Independence mode. The mode features the colonists in Jamestown the first chapter, and slowly progresses to the making of the declaration of Independence in the third chapter. Now to a few bad things, THIS GAME IS OLD so it does not have the BEST graphics and does not have more than 20 matches going on at a time in multiplayer. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (In all total war games) so they pretty much just all charge u at once unless u put the difficulty on expert. And in my opinion, the worst aspect of the game, THE TIME LIMIT! Grand Campaign and Road to Independence have a time limit, forcing you in the wonderfully brilliant campaign, to hurry up. OVERALL. the game is nice and fun, but does have a few problems which could easily be fixed, but wont be because the game is old.P.S. idgaf about the grammar mistakes bruh because i dont P.P.S. I know i didnt put a period at the end of my sentence there. That was to show i really dont GAF.P.P.P.S. or P.P.S.S. (I dont know) 10/10 IGN would free America again.			",13,1,0,0,2,0,4

( if they dont fix it - dont buy it ! )			",45,15,1,11,3,0,14

												Empire Total War is the game in the Total War series which appears to receive the most hate. Having played the game itself, I can safely say that it is decent. As a game it does what it does but no more no less. There are a limited number of units which are available to all sides save for the Indian, Ottoman, and Maratha factions. The gameplay itself can get repetitive overtime but still follows the format seen in all Total War games. Creative Assembly had done a good job in terms of historical accuracy and introduced me to different variations of troops seen during the 1700s. Compared to the other games, I can see where the hatred is coming from and I can see it for it's flaws but it does do what it is meant to do correctly. There are also minor inconveniencies such as the tax system of having to travel from region to region just to access it's stats which gets tricky once you have occupied  lot of them and that unrest is hard to quell.  I will give this game a 7/10.			",3,1,0,1,0,0,3

												This game is amazing I was probably playing It for 4 months and I finished 7 campaigns. The battles are really realistic specially the siege battles when the enemy is firing you with their cannons. Multiplayer is fun too playing against noobs pros It is fun. I like the campaign  but there is 1 thing I didn't like about the campaign It has few nations and they are just major nations. Like why can't we start with a terrible country and make It conquer the world. but else game is really good. I really recommend this game. I will give this game 94/100 Almost epic!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First I want to start with some baselines.I haven't done 5.0 hours like steam has recorded, that is a load of b******t. In fact I've done about 40 offline and get this game fairly well. Empire: Total War is much like it's previous games, start with a small empire, conquer land and build a mighty empire. Now I put it out there that Empire does have it's flaws, I am unable to play it now thanks to my current graphics card and ATi Catalyst Control Centre (beware ATi card owners), however I enjoyed this greatly. It builds upon what was last seen in Medieval 2 removing but mainly adding many great features such as sea warfare. The graphics are also greatly improved and suprisingly need a pretty decent PC compared to it's time (hint 2011 gaming PC) to run at maximum graphics which is fine. The grand campaign oh how's it's improved for the better. You now can manage your government, research new tech and ultimately do quite a bit more with what is done in your empire. However some things have been dumbed down a little. Cities have less buildings and are a bit less interesting when it comes to benefits of having them. Other aspects have improved though over predeccesors. The battles, what Total War is also renowned for has improved, adding sea battles which are mind blowing how detailed they are. Empire has done well with the land battles too, adding cover systems, buildings to hide your troops in and many great details that improve ways that battles are fought. Now on a less positive note, as noted before, this is glitchy, has problems with ATi cards and can have random stutters and crashes. Nevertheless these are completely random and could just be for random PC's. However beware and be prepared for such issues. This is graphically a masterpiece and ultimately a game that will always provide enjoyments for hours to come.Pros- Revamps battles and add sea battles.- Upgraded the campaign with new features.- Incredible graphics.Cons- Bugs and Glitches, random crashes.- ATi card issues.8/10 Gracious considering my issues with my graphics card otherwise would rate 9/10.

												I rewrite my review since I forgot to say the technical parts of the game. Yeah Empire TW is buggy and glitchy game, but at least a better than Rome 2. but still, This game make me can't stop to continue turn after turn in the campaign. This game gave best expirience after you get your goal. The odd statisfying aftertaste. Especially if you have Warpath campaign, that give you more whole new expirience but addiction if you get used to and find your way how to fight. And if you have time on battle, spent some to zoom into soldiers and hear the voicesAnd Multi Player, sadly almost no player now. But if there's a player this game is nice. sometimes you can win bcoz correct using of one unit. all about timing. Choose Prussia, First time I get Loyal Ally. God Bless Hannover			",53,7,0,2,9,0,1

												empire total war is one of my favourite games and thats because it focuses on a really intresting historical period, has lots of content the interface is very nice and clean, it introduced naval battles that were above average it has technologies and a good goverment system.The agents feel a little bit sub par compared to the improved shogun 2 but in some cases are better that the medieval 2 ones. The AI can be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there are a lot of bugs, most of them though have been fixed with patches. The DLC are not great but they aren't garbage even though you get little content for the price.The negotiation system is pretty bad, and the relations between nations is a mixed bag. I liked how the buildings works and trade is awesome. The generals though were pretty bad and gimmicky since you could win an otherwise unwinnable battle just by recruiting a bunch of them on the spot. I don not recommend this game to those that dont like this kind of warfare since some believe that watching lines of soldiers firing bullets at each other is pretty boring, as for me i really liked it especially when you get to research platoon firing.It's really addicting and very rarely annoying.

Absolutely stunning visually! One of the best looking TW games out there3. Cool time period with lots of different cultures.4. Fun battles.Cons:1. Way too complicated. Do the tutorial.2. No rebel settlements. That means you must pick and choose your targets much more carefully.3. Kinda annoying music.....All in all its an 8/10 in my book. I recommend getting Darthmod for it and playing a faction like England or Prussia for your first time! ",72,10,0,22,17,0,15

												This game is fantastic. The good things about it is the lardge scale battles, world map, the large amount of difrent units and  countries to shose from and of course the stratagy. You have to think in this game. The bad things about it is that it takes alot of memory and disk space so i reckomend to have a good PC. I have had multipel crashes in this game and corupted saves.In all i recomend this game.			",19,0,0,1,0,0,4

												Great game! Spend many hours playing this, I would also recommend the mod called ""Darthmod"" to add more content and too also makes the game run alot better. Would enjoy if The Creative Assembly would release the beta multiplayer campaign but in overall a great classic game, worth it!

												First I want to start with some baselines.I haven't done 5.0 hours like steam has recorded, that is a load of b******t. In fact I've done about 40 offline and get this game fairly well. Empire: Total War is much like it's previous games, start with a small empire, conquer land and build a mighty empire. Now I put it out there that Empire does have it's flaws, I am unable to play it now thanks to my current graphics card and ATi Catalyst Control Centre (beware ATi card owners), however I enjoyed this greatly. It builds upon what was last seen in Medieval 2 removing but mainly adding many great features such as sea warfare. The graphics are also greatly improved and suprisingly need a pretty decent PC compared to it's time (hint 2011 gaming PC) to run at maximum graphics which is fine. The grand campaign oh how's it's improved for the better. You now can manage your government, research new tech and ultimately do quite a bit more with what is done in your empire. However some things have been dumbed down a little. Cities have less buildings and are a bit less interesting when it comes to benefits of having them. Other aspects have improved though over predeccesors. The battles, what Total War is also renowned for has improved, adding sea battles which are mind blowing how detailed they are. Empire has done well with the land battles too, adding cover systems, buildings to hide your troops in and many great details that improve ways that battles are fought. Now on a less positive note, as noted before, this is glitchy, has problems with ATi cards and can have random stutters and crashes. Nevertheless these are completely random and could just be for random PC's. However beware and be prepared for such issues. This is graphically a masterpiece and ultimately a game that will always provide enjoyments for hours to come.Pros- Revamps battles and add sea battles.- Upgraded the campaign with new features.- Incredible graphics.Cons- Bugs and Glitches, random crashes.- ATi card issues.8/10 Gracious considering my issues with my graphics card otherwise would rate 9/10.

												Garbage===========================The controls are cumbersome and the units randomly disobey orders, making control on the battlefield frustrating: - the units keep switching to slow speed whenever you reroute them while marching- artillery frequently keeps firing even after you order it to pack and retreat (killing your own advancing troops) only if you deselect 'fire at will' it's guaranteed to stop- you can't create a path with waypoints.Battles, and especially sieges, are ludicrous and pathetic:- Forts are indestructible - the only way to capture them is by climbing the walls (really, in the age of artillery?)- The battle map is too small, you are not allowed to freely deploy your army and the game assigns you the most inconvenient spot - reinforcing enemy armies appear out of nowhere right near you, without any notice- artillery that rarely hits anything, although it's 'accuracy' is 45%. I tested once firing against a still infantry formation and registered a hit after 30 rounds.- brain dead AI that keeps standing still in the middle of artillery fire- large rebel armies with cavalry and artillery units spawned against game mechanics (how could recruitment happen so fast especially when you have 20 unit army in the province - and where would the money come from)The game map is terribly unbalanced, the provinces are way too large and weirdly separated.The whole concept of 'gentlemen' and rakes is completely beyond me, especially the difficulty in assasinating them. You should at least be able to expel or arrest them as an 'absolute monarch' of a mighty 'empire'. It would have been much better if you could recuit them like you do with armies and send them as ambassadors.Units appearing on the map are too large and those stupid flags are too big and obtrusive. Extremely dense and suicidal AI players that keep declaring war against much bigger opponents:if you declared war on me and I took three of your provinces including the capital, how would I give you one of my provinces when you call for peace?Too much art, too little substance.

Even though it was released in 2009 i still enjoy it now. the mix between real time and turn based strategy is realy awesome!!!! you take control of one of a variety of differnt empires and attempt to make your mark in history on a stunning in depth map. there is a lot of things you can do while managing your empire which make i really interesting and you feel like you are actualy the leader of a great nation.

												          Overall, I'd give this game a Giant: Meh. It makes you feel immersed when You have Dragoons peeking on a hill into an small Rank of militia, but the imersion breaks when 3 or 4 seconds before they peak, your militia shoots at the ground infront of the hill. Or how the enemy is marching toward your fort, and the walls have been destroyed. What do you do? Obviously cluster ♥♥♥♥ all of you troops into 2 houses and a church! Do that and you pretty much won. Or how the Only seiges on Towns in the game are scripted, like the Battle for Bunker hill at the begining of the American campaign.         And also, they don't even have Towns! They have a village and a Capital for each territory, and they are barely that. According to this game, A city can't have more than a Canonfoundry, Govenors Barracks, Weavers Cottage and Ironsmith without being too large. And a village, errr, Town can only have 1 building like a church or a school.        Other parts of the Campaign Map are terrible, too. The diplomacy takes 1 step forward to getting rid of diplomats, but 42 large train crashes backwards when you try to make a deal. Here's an example: I was doing an england game with scotland and ireland as protectorates. I captured algiers, and of course the riots and rebelions wouldn't stop. I decided to cut my loses and sell it to Ireland. I only asked for 7000 for it, but of course no. To put that into perspective, I had to pay 135,000 for bengal in one of my old american campaigns. So, I said ♥♥♥♥ it and wanted it for millitary access. But, Nope.avi. So I decided I was 420% done, and just gave it to them, but still? No. What the actual ♥♥♥♥.jpg        There are a few good points though. Mods will make the AI better, MUCH bettter. You can play as all factions with mods, also. The campaign MAP is huge. 2x the size of rome and medieval. The time it will take to take over the world is a long ♥♥♥♥ing time. Look at how long I have been playing, I have only beaten the game 10 times, And I don't even have warpath, which adds another 20+ hours.         Overall, This game was a 6/10 for me. So, if you have Rome 1, Medieval 2 and Shogun 2, get this aswell. If not, get those first.			",81,17,0,13,15,2,15

												Lets begin by saying that Napoleon: Total War is better if you are not willing to mod this game. N:TW is basically what Empire was supposed to be. Cost an extra game's worth :( See, E:TW was 'broken' into service. Originally so badly launched that you couldn't even play it until a week after release, it was patched over, and, over, this bug, that bug, and after a time, CA just said ""Damn, GG. Next game :("" So what's that make it now? The best Total War ever, ironically. Top three at least. Read on and see how this catastrophe turned into a miracle.History: After a long time, post - N:TW release, the head dev of CA came out and said something along the lines of (paraphrasing) ""E:TW was just beyond the scope of what we were capable of"" and  just gave all the deepest dev tools over to the mod community. Damn, E:TW looked so good in previews! I honestly was rooting for them all the way - this was gonna be a showstopper. But, we got more than we bargained for. See, guns were a massive step from medieval2 combat. Things were going to be different and people were stoked! But the AI wasn't quite there to match the era yet. For example, -the AI for properly lining a unit and properly zerging with a axes are two separate war principles-the economy of traditional units versus guns. Sorry horses - start of point and shoot warfare-AI could not manage artillery based combat AT ALL. Oh yes, in RL they shelled people down until they did something, it's a legitimate tactic. Pretty sure firing into hills is not.-some new features like research. If 2 schools beat the AI, it wasn't ready for players to go like, 8+Naval combat. First time ever! Ironically, this was the most polished AI and in major engagements it was okay. But when you realized it just chases it was so abusable. A 6th rate could sink the Spanish Armada solo by simply running alot and maintaining distance.But... the scale of the world, man! Gone were the days of Europe, you now manage an Empire. Multi-map, continental combat. The Earth itself. Yet, that was too grand a step for CA. Some serious design flaws led to, once again, easily abusable tactics that needed patches. Ex. The AI ""originally"" couldn't figure out how to land armies. If you were Britain you won the game, besides the OP start position you had in the world. No attempts to make a multimap game have occurred since Empire: Total War, from this time of writing. All evidence of an ""exterior world"" lies on beacons or map icons representing the rest of wherever, and you send a unit to sit on it like some couch potato. In Empire, you sent a freaking army, on your navy, D-day style. Oh hell yes!Luckily, like an Elder Scrolls mod community, E:TW's fans took the work into their hands and have many ways to polish this game into a true gem. Like rebuilding a classic car, not every '69 Fastback you can get comes in mint condition, and with the Karate Kid focus of many Empire fans, This Game is a Proper Addition to the Total War series. Thumbs Up. So before you go autobuy N:TW, consider E:TW plus a megamod. Something like DarthMod Ultimate Commander to this. Get the same-ish game for less, but with a polished AI, bug fixes galore, and so much more potential for mischief.Will the Inuit overwhelm the fledgling United States and invade France, causing a power struggle in Europe? Have you ever seen how big a Pirate armada can become if left unchecked? Will Britain win like always again because it has Jamaicans, or are Dutch coffee shops more powerful? All this and more inside :D			",47,0,1,9,5,0,17

												Favorite total war in my opinion, and I have Rome 2 and Shogun 2 also. First of all, the game feels so smooth compared to the other total wars, especially if u dont have the best computer, and theres even a Road to Independence mode. The mode features the colonists in Jamestown the first chapter, and slowly progresses to the making of the declaration of Independence in the third chapter. Now to a few bad things, THIS GAME IS OLD so it does not have the BEST graphics and does not have more than 20 matches going on at a time in multiplayer. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (In all total war games) so they pretty much just all charge u at once unless u put the difficulty on expert. And in my opinion, the worst aspect of the game, THE TIME LIMIT! Grand Campaign and Road to Independence have a time limit, forcing you in the wonderfully brilliant campaign, to hurry up. OVERALL. the game is nice and fun, but does have a few problems which could easily be fixed, but wont be because the game is old.P.S. idgaf about the grammar mistakes bruh because i dont P.P.S. I know i didnt put a period at the end of my sentence there. That was to show i really dont GAF.P.P.P.S. or P.P.S.S. (I dont know) 10/10 IGN would free America again.			",13,1,0,0,2,0,4

												Overall its a fun game..but this is just a complaint about the naval battles which are extremely boring and repetative. Perhaps auto-resolve? dont even think of it..you are going to be forced to fight(20 minutes of boring repetative game) dont think of autoresolving..even if you had the entire modern US NAVY, and nukes you would loss your fleet against one pirate sloop in autoresolve..OK, retreat? nope your ship will head in the absolute worse direction possible, and they will still catch and kill you.

												I rewrite my review since I forgot to say the technical parts of the game. Yeah Empire TW is buggy and glitchy game, but at least a better than Rome 2. but still, This game make me can't stop to continue turn after turn in the campaign. This game gave best expirience after you get your goal. The odd statisfying aftertaste. Especially if you have Warpath campaign, that give you more whole new expirience but addiction if you get used to and find your way how to fight. And if you have time on battle, spent some to zoom into soldiers and hear the voicesAnd Multi Player, sadly almost no player now. But if there's a player this game is nice. sometimes you can win bcoz correct using of one unit. all about timing. Choose Prussia, First time I get Loyal Ally. God Bless Hannover			",53,7,0,2,9,0,1

												I feel mightly bound to play this game , it gives access to the british empire spanning the globe and well making a lot of £££ from Tea and sugar , i feel ashemed of you if you of course pick the French they have to be dealt with very quickly you see with a lightning blow into Paris in the year 1725 (bet you didnt read that in your history books)ProsBritish people can earn a living from selling tea (win win win) American revolution can be crushed (like it should of)British people can invision the world as we see it , owning every possiable space of land, making stong treaties with the Dutch (love you guys) and of couse rulling the waves :)Cons Well sadly this game has many 'cons' and there is no way of avoiding it It is still extremely buggy ,the game has got less buggy from when it was released but this was released 2009The time span of this game is very short lived  , no 1800's means no Africa and no Africa means British person cant get our vital minerals :( Multiplayer is a joke go play napoleon total war if you want to play multiplayer for a simlar time periodA lack of the British anthem was found in the game i had to create a playlist with all my fav imperialistic tunes to make sure in my head i rulled the wavesThe religious feauture was a good concept but poor in game i hope if they redo a total war in 1700's era they really put a lot of effort into religion it was a key turning point of the time if you could have a religious peace you could controll a lot people I would reccoment this game for under £5 anything higher and i personally would not buy youll have some laughs (with the game if your British and at yourself if your French)Thankyou if you got this far :)			",19,1,0,2,3,0,4

												Garbage===========================The controls are cumbersome and the units randomly disobey orders, making control on the battlefield frustrating: - the units keep switching to slow speed whenever you reroute them while marching- artillery frequently keeps firing even after you order it to pack and retreat (killing your own advancing troops) only if you deselect 'fire at will' it's guaranteed to stop- you can't create a path with waypoints.Battles, and especially sieges, are ludicrous and pathetic:- Forts are indestructible - the only way to capture them is by climbing the walls (really, in the age of artillery?)- The battle map is too small, you are not allowed to freely deploy your army and the game assigns you the most inconvenient spot - reinforcing enemy armies appear out of nowhere right near you, without any notice- artillery that rarely hits anything, although it's 'accuracy' is 45%. I tested once firing against a still infantry formation and registered a hit after 30 rounds.- brain dead AI that keeps standing still in the middle of artillery fire- large rebel armies with cavalry and artillery units spawned against game mechanics (how could recruitment happen so fast especially when you have 20 unit army in the province - and where would the money come from)The game map is terribly unbalanced, the provinces are way too large and weirdly separated.The whole concept of 'gentlemen' and rakes is completely beyond me, especially the difficulty in assasinating them. You should at least be able to expel or arrest them as an 'absolute monarch' of a mighty 'empire'. It would have been much better if you could recuit them like you do with armies and send them as ambassadors.Units appearing on the map are too large and those stupid flags are too big and obtrusive. Extremely dense and suicidal AI players that keep declaring war against much bigger opponents:if you declared war on me and I took three of your provinces including the capital, how would I give you one of my provinces when you call for peace?Too much art, too little substance.

												Empire is the first Total War to really, truly take risks.It gets a lot of them right, but it also gets a lot of them wrong. If this was 2009, I'd tell you I recommend it. However, the existence of Napoleon Total War is why I say it's a pass, and NTW improved on many issues.Let's start by just saying the AI is bad. Like older TW games. Can be fixed by mods, but the vanilla AI...no.All factions have some unique units, but for the most part, they are all the same. Especially when it comes to ships.Speaking about ships, the naval battles are too difficult to manage in real time, and even pausing it every 10 seconds doesn't help. Again, real time naval battles is new. It's a big risk; the first TW to have them. But, alas they are just not fun in the end.There is also the issue of agents. You can't manually recruit them. They come automatically recruited with certain buildings, and are limited to the amount of buildings of that type. Yes, you can dismantle buildings ans build the ones you need for agents, but that usually comes at the price of losing powerful economic opportunities. So, when it comes to strategy on the campaign map, you are very limited. How and where you move your armies doesn't really matter as much as it used to.A positive additon however is the spread of buildings throughout provinces and thus allowing you to garrison armies in these buildings...or burn down enemy buildings in their provinces. Definitely a fun, strategic addition to the map.On the battle map, there are too many sprites. No matter how high I put the graphics, I always end up seeing 2D sprites and it looks terrible. Playing a newer TW on same graphics or lower even yields less 2D pics. The map control in the battlefield is also really bad. Try zooming in, and you will lose track of where the camera is. And, the absolute worst part of the battle mechanics is that you can't even see which unit your regiment is attacking. In older TW games, you can hold SHIFT button and it tells you the destination/target of your unit. This removal is a pain, but if anything, the addition of 0.5x speed is nice. Let's you find a middle ground between pausing the game a lot to develop tactics vs playing at normal speed and having a hard time to micromanage units.I could go more, but I think I've made it clear that the game has a lot of faults, especially in campaign. It also does a lot of things good and adds much-needed abilities. Still, Napoleon just took Empire, cleaned it up, and made it look better. (Albeit the loss of the world map, but that's not really a problem)			",12,0,0,4,0,0,8

												Ive had alot of fun with this game, its got its bad points like waiting ages for your next turn on the campaign map but this is because the world map is huge, it was a scale that had never been done before and there was a number of bugs at launch which most have been addressed by patches since. In my view napolian TW is a better buy but has a smaller campaign map, only europe so its up to you to decide what you want to achieve, the whole world in empire or just europe as in napolians case. If you have experianced a TW game then this is pretty much more of the same only on a bigger scale, infantry line battles, cannons, naval warfare its all here, not the best in the series but def not the worst and if your a fan of the series or enjoy RTS games then you should def pick this one up, Empire is very grand on scale which brings bugs and issues much like rome 2 and napolian only beats its score because it just feels like an improved version of empire but this is still a great game in the series and i recommend it, Overall 7.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to give this game a thumbs up, but after multiple revisits on and on off steam. After patching fixed most bugs, and mods filled the gaps left by campaign features. It still just falls short. The only thing this game has beyond the other total wars is ambition. With -The Americas, Europe, India, and four ocean trade arenas the campaign map is a sprawling magnificent thing. It isn't quite the global total war game I'd always wanted but it's the closest they have ever come in scope. However, the battles don't play as well as the Fall of the Samurai would manage for Shogun 2, the campaign doesn't have the flow of later titles, or the tight focus of the earlier ones. All and all the game is the awkward middle child of the series, and doesn't benefit from it. Even if you install it and never encounter a bug, which seems unlikely even after the wave of patches - you will still likely find the game to fall short of its ambition. Unless you are just absolutely in love with the era I'd recommend other Total War games - or even the Europa series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. Not quite as good as Napoleon: Total War graphics-wise, but certainly an improvement on its predecessors (Medieval II and Rome I). A large variety of unique units for eleven playable factions makes the campaign experience much more enjoyable than NTW.Along with the many unit types, the length of the Grand Campaign and its many features and theaters-of-war are wonderful; it was rather disappointing not to see as much in the NTW campaigns. I've never particularly liked naval battles, however, Empire sea battles are very nice. If your computer can handle it, turn up those graphics!All in all, a very nice experience. Great Grand Strategy game, both singleplayer and multiplayer. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												J'irai droit au but : pour moi il s'agit du meilleur Total War.La période est très intéressante : elle permet de confronter des monarchies et des républiques, de révolter les peuples, d'initier la colonisation... Elle est très bien retranscrite.Le jeu se déroule sur 3 grands théatres : Amériques, Europe, et Inde, et 4 comptoirs commerciaux : Amérique du Sud, Afrique de l'Ouest, Afrique de l'Est, Indonésie. Tous ces lieux sont connectés par des voies maritimes.C'est dont un Total War qui se déroule sur presque toute la planète, et c'est un énorme plus par rapport aux autres Total War! Car les cartes de batailles sont variées (neige en Russie, cannes à sucre aux Antilles...). Du coup, les guerres deviennent souvent mondiales, et peuvent vous emmener beaucoup plus loin que prévu (guerre dans les colonies, sur mer...) La durée d'une seule partie peut donc être absolument énorme (plusieurs semaines assidues).Les batailles sont intéressantes et dépeignent bien les batailles de l'époque. Au début, la stratégie est assez basique, puis devient complexe au fur et à mesure des évolution technologiques. Car les technologies se débloquent par des recherches. Tout débloquer peut devenir long. Ces technologies changent vraiment le cours de la partie et enrichissent considérablement le gameplay (tant au niveau stratégique que gestion).Les batailles navales, introduites dans cet opus, sont également épiques. Elles sont plus difficiles car il ne faut absolument pas utiliser les mêmes stratégies que les batailles terrestres. Personnellement, j'ai consulté wikipedia sur les tactiques navales de l'époque pour pouvoir gagner des batailles navales en effectif inférieur et sans trop de casse.Empire Total War est donc un excellent jeu. Il est pour moi le meilleur des Total War pour l'époque, la mondialisation du conflit, les technologies, les régimes politiques.Je le recommande chaudement aux amateurs de stratégie et aux amateurs d'histoire également, car ce jeu est très très bien fait du point du vue historique.

""The most broken Total War game in history""While the introduction of naval battles were great ideas and gun powder battles in general are great fun, I have never had a worse experience than this with any Total War game. Not even Rome II at it's release was as buggy as Empire still is today. After playing Empire for 42h I can easily say Empire Total War has the worst AI in any game of the series. So far I've seen the AI defending a fort by assembling all it's troops in the center the fort, allowing my men to climb the walls and kill all of them without taking a single hit.Even deadlier for the AI's troops and yours as well is walking stairs. I can't describe how often I've seen soldiers getting off a fort wall via a staircase simply fall over and die by the hundreds. Once they reach the bottom of the staircase they just fall over, without taking any hits. Hundreds of dead bodies on a single spot. This bug wasn't even fixed in Empire's sequel/standalone addon Napoleon Total War. In fact this even happened to me more frequently there. This is gamebreaking and it's unbelievable how these bugs still haven't been fixed.tl;dr Many gamebreaking bugs, even years after release ",91,16,0,23,25,0,20

												Empire is a great game, yes the in-game graphics have problems when you are not zoomed in close enough, yes there are various dissapointments but you ENJOY it. If you you enjoy playing it, don't whine about it's issues, have fun. I especially enjoyed playing the road to independance campaigns and aybody who enjoys RTS should have fun playing this.

												Good game to play with friends but, a little boring alone. After you beat the main caimpagn's of course. It has a suprisingly good story and a great introduction. Total war games are made by legit people who have a huge list of games that veri. From The Moddern era - to the Medieval age/ Dark age. They will continue making more hopefully as i play it with my friends and his friends. But as a conclusion my rating for this game is a 10 out of 10/  5 stars			",64,14,1,14,11,0,14

Sadly I've never played any of the other TWs but this game is just brillaint, if your like me and you've never played a TW game well then this one will draw you into countless hours of fun. Never before have I come across a RTS where its so challenging but then so rewarding, and having the chance to fight in 3 theatres of war is brillaint. A must have game ;)			",67,6,2,16,12,1,24

												I feel mightly bound to play this game , it gives access to the british empire spanning the globe and well making a lot of £££ from Tea and sugar , i feel ashemed of you if you of course pick the French they have to be dealt with very quickly you see with a lightning blow into Paris in the year 1725 (bet you didnt read that in your history books)ProsBritish people can earn a living from selling tea (win win win) American revolution can be crushed (like it should of)British people can invision the world as we see it , owning every possiable space of land, making stong treaties with the Dutch (love you guys) and of couse rulling the waves :)Cons Well sadly this game has many 'cons' and there is no way of avoiding it It is still extremely buggy ,the game has got less buggy from when it was released but this was released 2009The time span of this game is very short lived  , no 1800's means no Africa and no Africa means British person cant get our vital minerals :( Multiplayer is a joke go play napoleon total war if you want to play multiplayer for a simlar time periodA lack of the British anthem was found in the game i had to create a playlist with all my fav imperialistic tunes to make sure in my head i rulled the wavesThe religious feauture was a good concept but poor in game i hope if they redo a total war in 1700's era they really put a lot of effort into religion it was a key turning point of the time if you could have a religious peace you could controll a lot people I would reccoment this game for under £5 anything higher and i personally would not buy youll have some laughs (with the game if your British and at yourself if your French)Thankyou if you got this far :)			",19,1,0,2,3,0,4

												Good game. Not quite as good as Napoleon: Total War graphics-wise, but certainly an improvement on its predecessors (Medieval II and Rome I). A large variety of unique units for eleven playable factions makes the campaign experience much more enjoyable than NTW.Along with the many unit types, the length of the Grand Campaign and its many features and theaters-of-war are wonderful; it was rather disappointing not to see as much in the NTW campaigns. I've never particularly liked naval battles, however, Empire sea battles are very nice. If your computer can handle it, turn up those graphics!All in all, a very nice experience. Great Grand Strategy game, both singleplayer and multiplayer. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ive had alot of fun with this game, its got its bad points like waiting ages for your next turn on the campaign map but this is because the world map is huge, it was a scale that had never been done before and there was a number of bugs at launch which most have been addressed by patches since. In my view napolian TW is a better buy but has a smaller campaign map, only europe so its up to you to decide what you want to achieve, the whole world in empire or just europe as in napolians case. If you have experianced a TW game then this is pretty much more of the same only on a bigger scale, infantry line battles, cannons, naval warfare its all here, not the best in the series but def not the worst and if your a fan of the series or enjoy RTS games then you should def pick this one up, Empire is very grand on scale which brings bugs and issues much like rome 2 and napolian only beats its score because it just feels like an improved version of empire but this is still a great game in the series and i recommend it, Overall 7.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire is the first Total War to really, truly take risks.It gets a lot of them right, but it also gets a lot of them wrong. If this was 2009, I'd tell you I recommend it. However, the existence of Napoleon Total War is why I say it's a pass, and NTW improved on many issues.Let's start by just saying the AI is bad. Like older TW games. Can be fixed by mods, but the vanilla AI...no.All factions have some unique units, but for the most part, they are all the same. Especially when it comes to ships.Speaking about ships, the naval battles are too difficult to manage in real time, and even pausing it every 10 seconds doesn't help. Again, real time naval battles is new. It's a big risk; the first TW to have them. But, alas they are just not fun in the end.There is also the issue of agents. You can't manually recruit them. They come automatically recruited with certain buildings, and are limited to the amount of buildings of that type. Yes, you can dismantle buildings ans build the ones you need for agents, but that usually comes at the price of losing powerful economic opportunities. So, when it comes to strategy on the campaign map, you are very limited. How and where you move your armies doesn't really matter as much as it used to.A positive additon however is the spread of buildings throughout provinces and thus allowing you to garrison armies in these buildings...or burn down enemy buildings in their provinces. Definitely a fun, strategic addition to the map.On the battle map, there are too many sprites. No matter how high I put the graphics, I always end up seeing 2D sprites and it looks terrible. Playing a newer TW on same graphics or lower even yields less 2D pics. The map control in the battlefield is also really bad. Try zooming in, and you will lose track of where the camera is. And, the absolute worst part of the battle mechanics is that you can't even see which unit your regiment is attacking. In older TW games, you can hold SHIFT button and it tells you the destination/target of your unit. This removal is a pain, but if anything, the addition of 0.5x speed is nice. Let's you find a middle ground between pausing the game a lot to develop tactics vs playing at normal speed and having a hard time to micromanage units.I could go more, but I think I've made it clear that the game has a lot of faults, especially in campaign. It also does a lot of things good and adds much-needed abilities. Still, Napoleon just took Empire, cleaned it up, and made it look better. (Albeit the loss of the world map, but that's not really a problem)			",12,0,0,4,0,0,8

												J'irai droit au but : pour moi il s'agit du meilleur Total War.La période est très intéressante : elle permet de confronter des monarchies et des républiques, de révolter les peuples, d'initier la colonisation... Elle est très bien retranscrite.Le jeu se déroule sur 3 grands théatres : Amériques, Europe, et Inde, et 4 comptoirs commerciaux : Amérique du Sud, Afrique de l'Ouest, Afrique de l'Est, Indonésie. Tous ces lieux sont connectés par des voies maritimes.C'est dont un Total War qui se déroule sur presque toute la planète, et c'est un énorme plus par rapport aux autres Total War! Car les cartes de batailles sont variées (neige en Russie, cannes à sucre aux Antilles...). Du coup, les guerres deviennent souvent mondiales, et peuvent vous emmener beaucoup plus loin que prévu (guerre dans les colonies, sur mer...) La durée d'une seule partie peut donc être absolument énorme (plusieurs semaines assidues).Les batailles sont intéressantes et dépeignent bien les batailles de l'époque. Au début, la stratégie est assez basique, puis devient complexe au fur et à mesure des évolution technologiques. Car les technologies se débloquent par des recherches. Tout débloquer peut devenir long. Ces technologies changent vraiment le cours de la partie et enrichissent considérablement le gameplay (tant au niveau stratégique que gestion).Les batailles navales, introduites dans cet opus, sont également épiques. Elles sont plus difficiles car il ne faut absolument pas utiliser les mêmes stratégies que les batailles terrestres. Personnellement, j'ai consulté wikipedia sur les tactiques navales de l'époque pour pouvoir gagner des batailles navales en effectif inférieur et sans trop de casse.Empire Total War est donc un excellent jeu. Il est pour moi le meilleur des Total War pour l'époque, la mondialisation du conflit, les technologies, les régimes politiques.Je le recommande chaudement aux amateurs de stratégie et aux amateurs d'histoire également, car ce jeu est très très bien fait du point du vue historique.

												I want to give this game a thumbs up, but after multiple revisits on and on off steam. After patching fixed most bugs, and mods filled the gaps left by campaign features. It still just falls short. The only thing this game has beyond the other total wars is ambition. With -The Americas, Europe, India, and four ocean trade arenas the campaign map is a sprawling magnificent thing. It isn't quite the global total war game I'd always wanted but it's the closest they have ever come in scope. However, the battles don't play as well as the Fall of the Samurai would manage for Shogun 2, the campaign doesn't have the flow of later titles, or the tight focus of the earlier ones. All and all the game is the awkward middle child of the series, and doesn't benefit from it. Even if you install it and never encounter a bug, which seems unlikely even after the wave of patches - you will still likely find the game to fall short of its ambition. Unless you are just absolutely in love with the era I'd recommend other Total War games - or even the Europa series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've never particularly liked naval battles, however, Empire sea battles are very nice. If your computer can handle it, turn up those graphics!All in all, a very nice experience. Great Grand Strategy game, both singleplayer and multiplayer. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to give this game a thumbs up, but after multiple revisits on and on off steam. After patching fixed most bugs, and mods filled the gaps left by campaign features. It still just falls short. The only thing this game has beyond the other total wars is ambition. With -The Americas, Europe, India, and four ocean trade arenas the campaign map is a sprawling magnificent thing. It isn't quite the global total war game I'd always wanted but it's the closest they have ever come in scope. However, the battles don't play as well as the Fall of the Samurai would manage for Shogun 2, the campaign doesn't have the flow of later titles, or the tight focus of the earlier ones. All and all the game is the awkward middle child of the series, and doesn't benefit from it. Even if you install it and never encounter a bug, which seems unlikely even after the wave of patches - you will still likely find the game to fall short of its ambition. Unless you are just absolutely in love with the era I'd recommend other Total War games - or even the Europa series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Took a long time but this game finally hooked me.  Here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Voice acting is EXQUISITE.  If you are multilingual, try playing one of the countries where you know their language.  The Tutons speak German, the Indians speak (what?  Hindi?), the Britians speak English with a British accent, and the Americans speak with an American accent.- The tactical battles are very good.This might also depend on what AI difficulty you choose - but at a normal difficulty tactical battles are interesting.  They might even be considered the core gameplay of the game, and avoiding them with autoresolve means far worse outcomes than playing them yourself.- The quotes during loads are interesting reading- The way the world is divided adds a new mechanic (instead of having one contiguous map)This adds some confusion, but after understanding it the mechanic adds an extra dimension to the gameplay.- Economic system is goodCons:- By now most TBS games have a consistent UI at least where outstanding tasks are concerned, but not Total WarIf you forgot to move that unit who's been sitting idle for the last 3 turns - it's your fault.  You should have gone and looked at a book or something.  Or you should play Warlock or Civ or Fallen Enchantress or Endless Space because ALL of those games handle this exactly the same way with a list in the right column.- Don't let the campaign turn you off.It's not a great campaign, but at least there is one.  The downside is the campaign hides some of the goodness the game has to offer, and there are confusing moments at the very beginning where the tactical battle makes no sense.  [Not a good time to confuse players.  Devs, I recommend ""never"" as the best time to confuse players.]- Sea battles are just too realistic (which translates into boring)I know I know... ""It's realistic!  We went to some naval museum or whatnot and got accurate reproductions of these ships and the physics blah blah blah...""  We don't care.  Well I don't anyways.  Can't you put in a realism slider?  I'm used to ship handling like in Pirates!  And this is WAAAAY too slow even accelerated.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also, you can't really tell which of the various countries might resonate with you, so don't get turned off by the first country you try to play.  I played Britian for a while, and then on a whim switched to playing India and loved it.  The best way is to experiment.In all it's a satisfying game.  If you aren't absolutely sure it will play on your systme (and some people have seen crashes), then try the demo first.			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												Definatley the longest Total War. Epic Battles spanning three continents and many enemies. The combat is good and the troops each with their own strengts and weaknesess. Fight Natives in America, Superpowers in Europe and Elephants in India. The campaign has hours of replay time as you conquer the world with each of the eleven nations each with their own problems.Then when the campaign becomes boring go to Multiplayer where siege is won with strategy and cunning or spamming rockets and open fields become bloodbaths.

												Many DLCs and gigabytes of patches later, the game is still crap. The campaign mode is better than in previous total wars, but battles are even more of a clusterfukk due to AI being too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to use any tactics including muskets (not that AI was ever at least not-too-bad in total wars). I tried to like it. I really tried. Seems like none of the modern Total Wars can achieve being a good game like the first Shogun is or as a modden Rome/Medieval II are.

												A good turn-based strategy game.  The things they got right are mostly how you manage your country's resources and diplomatic relations.  In my experience with the game, I  have encountered major problems in terms of computing casualties/damage, to the point where the only real way to win is to bayonet rush or use the ""autoresolve"" feature.  I recall witnessing on several occasions a foot soldier take a cannonball to the face and continue marching unscathed.  This may have been fixed in newer versions, or it could have been a problem with my hardware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not going to write a complex review likve I've done before. I'll just say this; Empire is a good game, with good mechanics, a good environment, and a good theatre of war. The problem with Empire is that it's dying. Napoleon has basically rendered this game obsolete since it just expands on this game but brings in new things and slightly better land and naval combat. Therefore I cannot recommend this game since there is a successor. However, if you like to fight on different fonts, this game is good. Just keep in mind that it is fairly buggy.			",18,5,0,1,1,1,11

												Not the best ""Total War"" game in the franchise, but not bad either.  I prefer Medieval Total War 2, or 1, or ROME total war.  But this game adds an interesting 'world wide' perspective the other Total War games lack.  Plus it has naval combat.  Which isn't very hard, and actually sucks up more time than any other aspect of the game.  I've spent literally hours in naval fights.  Its fun for awhile, but gets to feeling like work eventually.I'm voting NO on this one, but if you're a fan of ""Total War"" games, you might like this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The grand campaign is the meat of Empire: Total War, and it's there where you're likely to spend the most amount of time. The game stretches across the 18th century and lets you choose from a number of world powers, from Great Britain and Russia to fallen domains such as the Maratha Confederacy and the Ottoman Empire. Once you choose an empire, you can select from a few different campaign types that determine victory conditions and campaign length. Whichever you decide, be prepared: Even a short, 50-year campaign can take a good amount of time to complete, given that each turn requires strategic thinking on multiple fronts. Battles usually determine how regions are won and lost, but diplomatic relations, economic strangleholds, assassinations, and many other subtleties must be tweaked and considered at each turn, and they have noticeable impact as the years progress. If this sounds overwhelming, or if you're an American history buff, you'll want to check out the Road to Independence campaign before jumping into the grand one. This is essentially a long American tutorial that slowly introduces you to the basics and culminates in a grand campaign of its own.The factors you must consider run the gamut, starting with an important new feature: the technology tree. Three areas of research and multiple subtrees let you improve your military, industry, and philosophy; in turn, your choices may benefit your economy or your success in battle. The benefits may seem minor at first, but as the campaign wears on, their effects are more noticeable, and your choices within these trees must be informed by the strengths and weaknesses of your particular empire. Do you concentrate on industry and use sheer numbers of troops to overwhelm your enemies, or do you focus on naval improvements and reap the ensuing benefits of successful trade-route blockades? As your campaign wears on, your needs may shift, whether because enemy blockades require a stronger navy, because you are spreading quickly across land, or because your economy is unable to sustain your growing army. Technology is also a limited diplomatic option, given that it's a commodity that you can not only trade during negotiations but also steal from foes. Additionally, it's not easy to convince a friendly nation to offer technology. Even when offered multiple technologies or monetary compensation, your closest allies rarely accept a request to share even a single technology, which makes it a limited political tool. In Empire: Total War, knowledge is more easily stolen than shared.In fact, your more successful political dealings are the underhanded ones. Your agents may differ between nations (for example, gentlemen and rakes for the British, scholars and hashishin for the Ottomans), but the tasks are similar: covertly disrupt the affairs of your enemies and potential enemies. Religious agents such as missionaries will slowly but surely convert the populace, staving off potential rebellion in newly captured regions. On the other hand, the impact of religion is not as deep or impactful as in the Europa Universalis series, in which social and diplomatic events are more fully explored. Regardless, it's great fun to cripple whole economies, especially when your strategies work in tandem with each other. Sending in a naval fleet to seize enemy trade supplies, sending another directly into an enemy's port (and therefore obstructing incoming goods), and dispatching an agent to sabotage commercial ports can have profound effects. In cases like these, an angry, resource-deprived public and cash-strapped armies then ease the way for a quick triumph.Overall i think this is one of my favorite games of my childhood, which i totally suggest anyone who hasn't been able to play this game to get it and try it.

Pros Great Graphics for its time!Amazing campaign mode!Huge world map!Amazing Ranged and meele Combat!Tons of factions to play as!Tons of mods to get!Great trading system!And more! Cons Sieges sometimes can get a little buggy however, playable.Doesn't have a steam workshop.Naval combat is a little frusturating to new players. Conclusion In conclusion, Empire total war is a great gane with just a few little bugs however, I reccomend this game to any total war player that like more ranged base combat like Napeloen Total War! *Notice* If you are a huge fan for more meele based combat and dont like ranged gun combat this game might not be for you. 9/10  ",85,5,0,7,20,0,16

												No mods base game evaluation. DO NOT BUY.Overall score 3/10This game plainly capitalizes on the success of previous releases. First time for me when CA seriously dropped the ball, but the more I play it the more I realize I should have had a refund.PositivesThe game looks good when zoomed in.New game mechanics in advanced trade, multi warzones around the globe. Sea combat. New nations.NegativesFeel: Maybe it is the period, but all European nations feel totally the same. Other than that nations have specific end buildings in capitals which helps with the immersion.Fights: 0/10 to AI quality.Pathfinding is abismal.You attack a unit infront of you, and your guys start running away (not retreating, or fleeing, running away from their goal.) Worse is, if you click right behind the enemy, they run towards the point without an issue. (Something is wrong with the attack script and it mainly happens in fort defense or attack.)Units CANNOT use walls.This was done in medieval, but here CA failed to do what they already had in the past.1 guy is out of position running back and forth in the same place, so the entire unit just stands about without firing a single shot. And units CANNOT find a route off-on a wall. 1 bloke is stuck on the wall? Well the entire unit runs back to him, even if they almost reached their target already. Gates are used in a 1 man line for some reason they are as if they were a tight rope.Your cannons play a very important role. BUT you MUST switch off auto aim. The canon crews execute themselves firing sideways, through the cannon next to them within the same crew, just to be scared of their own mental backwardness and flee in terror. They will also happily execute anyone on their side without further consideration.If you want to put down money for such a game buy medieval or ""buy it off a friend"" and fund modders who may fix this cluster mess. On that point, it is also harder to mod this game than Medieval, so you will find fewer overhauls and fixes.Whioever scored this game higher... I do not know what you see in it, compared ot working games. If I put Medieval2 at 8/10 this cannot be above 5. It is bling and nicer, but years have passed, it MUST be nicer. If this was released by anyone else it would be a total flop without a single mention in any gaming press.			",7,2,0,9,3,1,14

												Buy ""Napoleon: Total War"" instead. Its multiplayer is actually alive, better graphics, better optimized, and it has one of the best mods ever created for any game. The ""Darth Mod"".If you're generally a Total War fan though, it's indeed worth it.			",63,8,3,9,10,0,13

												This is I believe the most massive of all the TW campaign maps, and it can take an eternity to achieve victory. You should know the deal. Stealing technology is a sweet feature unique to this one, and I would probably buy it just to see the uniforms, they look incredible and there are hundreds of different units. 9/10 Take it slow on the warmongering, this is not Shogun			",64,3,0,4,8,0,20

												This would have been a great game if the AI was not so absurdly erratic. Declarations of war occur without any clear logic, and alliances are broken by the AI in the same way. This is a game for people only interested in battles per se without any real interest on the reasons why they are fought. It is impossible to develop any grand strategy due to the fact that the behaviour of the states controlled by the AI is just brainless. It is a pity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
