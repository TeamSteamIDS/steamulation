												Do you like logic games? Then you should play this game because it's amazing and has a ~ridiculous~ number of puzzles in it. It's also very calm and relaxing to boot.Are you dumb? Then this game is perfect, because difficulty ranges from insultingly easy to challenging for autistics, with a nice difficulty curve that increases puzzle complexity as you go. You can stay at a difficulty level as long as you want, or you can jump to higher levels pretty quickly if you want. YOU CAN DO ANYTHINGDo you like sudoku? Then I'm sorry, because sudoku is an inferior baby game for babies. If you are a baby, then by all means go play sudoku instead, you big dumb baby.This game is so fantastic that it will put hair on your chest, even if you're a woman, so if you're a woman and you play this game, enjoy your hairy chest and awesome puzzle game.

												What is this game? Well, first of all it is not really a game but rather a collection of simple mathematical riddles where you have to fill a field of nxn spaces with the correct numbers, as can be seen in the screenshots. There really isn't much more to be said, the game is nicely done and while all the riddles can be logically solved, they will keep you thinking if you choose the grid size that fits your skill.This one has so many riddles, if you're into that kind of mathematical casual game, you have something for many hours. If you go however for achievements, it will be a real grind to get the final one.It can't really be compared to other games, for the reasons given. It rather can be compared to riddles, such as Sudoku, and there it would stand as an own genre.Recommended: Yes			",2038,892,96,313,282,21,401

												This is a fun puzzle game.Other reviews relate this to Sodoku....and this is not that gameThis is KEN KEN or rather a game where you are given lots of clues as to what numbers go in which squares.  Alot simpler then Sodoku but in some ways more challenging. This game makes you use your math skills and as you play you will notice it is teaching you or getting you to use basic Algebra.  Until you get to the most advanced puzzles which are very thought provoking.I recommend this game for people who like puzzles and basic math skills to solves puzzles.Music is top notch as are the sound effects.  This game also gives you clues as you go...and you can always redo a puzzle if you want to.  ",462,165,13,102,25,0,61

												Hey, it's this game, and they finally started selling it again!! It's really addictive and a fantastic time waster. The game has gotten some kind of legendary status due to its extended absence from the steam store, so I'll say if you're expecting it to be the second coming of Christ in the form of a puzzle game you may be disappointed. But it's a really solid game that you can sink a lot of time into, and I'm glad it's back.			",190,63,6,29,22,5,50

												Pretentious Title: SquareLogic is an abstract puzzle game that takes the concept behind sudoku and twists it to create something far more interesting and engaging.  Like sudoku, the goal is to fill a square grid such that the numbers appear only once in each column and row.SquareLogic's twist on the formula is in the cage system.  Instead of prepopulating the grid with enough numbers to solve the puzzle, SquareLogic divides the board into arbitrary chunks, called cages, and assigns a mathematical rule to each.  For instance, one cage may require its content to sum to 8, another may require its smaller value to divide the larger value 4 times.  Other cages impose inequality operators on the divisions between cages, indicating that one square must contain a larger or smaller number than its neighbor.  The puzzles have extra mechanics beyond the cages as well, including double-puzzles, where two grids contain the same solution but different cages, each providing too little to solve on its own, but enough to solve when paired with the other.  Other puzzle types may leave some cages unfinished and require the player to paint them in as they go.This formula would likely be overwhelming and tedious, especially on full-sized 9x9 puzzles (the game ranges from 4x4 to 9x9).  However, the game automatically removes numbers from tiles when that number is used elsewhere in the column/row, and players can right click any number to remove it as a viable option.  This effectively automates the more menial part of the puzzle, leaving the logical problem solving front and center.  The game also highlights possible valid combinations for cages in a small window, so you don't have to constantly keep a calculator by your side to determine what factorizations are possible for a number set.  Because of these features, the puzzles go by quickly and rarely feel like they're ever wasting your time.SquareLogic isn't flawless though.  The 4x4 puzzles are almost comically easy due to their small size, while the 9x9 and some 8x8 puzzles can become frustrating and tedious because there is simply too much information to pore over.  It becomes less a game of applying logic and more of a mindless search for the next clue you can use.  Luckily, the game still has plenty of 6x6 and 7x7 puzzles, which feel extremely well paced.Another problem is the immediate error highlighting feature.  When you first boot up the game, go into options and turn this setting off immediately.  This setting causes the game to tell you the very instant you make a mistake.  It's a feature that is quite literally too helpful, as it quietly encourages you to start guessing whenever you begin having trouble.  With this disabled though, there's still an incredibly nice hint feature to help you out of jams.  Rather than openly tell you what's wrong, it simply highlights a section of the grid where you should be able to either eliminate possibilites or find a correct number.  It's especially useful on the large puzzles where it's easy to have too many options to pore over.The one last problem is somewhat debatable.  The game simply has too many puzzles.  It has 6 regions, each with a staggeringly large number of available puzzles.  The first area alone contains 4800.  That is not an exaggeration.  While it certainly means the game has incredible value, it can be a little disheartening to know that you're not likely to ever even come close to finishing all of the puzzles.  Oh, and anyone obsessed with achievements would do well to avoid this game for that reason, unless you want to solve all 4800 puzzles in the first region for a cheevo.Overall, for anyone who likes abstract logic puzzles, SquareLogic is pretty much top class.  It's fun, mostly well paced, has a ton of puzzles and lots of good mechanics.  Well worth the $5 asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great time-wasting puzzle game.If you want challenging, they have challenging grids (9x9).  If you want brain-dead easy (for when your brain isn't working well), they have easy, 4x4 grids.  There are many different solution-types for every grid size, making a huge number of total puzzles to solve (maybe 15-20K).The last achievement is a grind, but I've still played for many, many hours since getting it.  Now if they would just add one for doing ALL the puzzles...  (Actually, I'd like them to make another game instead!)			",313,154,1,56,59,3,88

												First off: It astonishes me that this game has had such a long shelf life. I've been playing for years (prior to purchasing it on Steam), and the discussions board is still pretty active. Those who play it, generally keep playing it.So, with a name like ""Everyday Genius,"" it's pretty easy to be scared off; one could be forgiven for thinking this to be a hardcore math game. It isn't. It's more logic puzzle than anything else, although it remains unique. It is not like Sudoku, except that it uses numbers and the process of elimination to reach a solution. Simply put, you're presented with a single grid (to start). Inside each grid is a series of puzzle boxes that contain different mathematical symbols along with the numbers 1 through 4 (I said math isn't really needed, and I didn't lie; keep reading). An equal sign (for example ""4="") inside a box simply means the answer is the number 4. Two boxes reading ""3+"" means that the answer will be 3, and it is achieved by adding two numbers together (1+2). Like Sudoku (which this really isn't), numbers can only be used once in each row or column. Each puzzle within the grid can be several boxes, and they are painted the same color so that you know they are one puzzle (for example, 1x2x3=6, might all be painted green). You get the idea.What keeps it from being less math and more logic is that mousing over any box will automatically show you all possible combinations for the solution. As you solve more puzzles inside each grid, these possible solutions will also change, due to process of elimination. Eliminated numbers will automatically disappear from each puzzle, and you can also manually remove them by right-clicking. Because of this, it really is possible to solve each grid without much math skill.The variety offered here is stunning. You will use greater than and less than symbols; straights (3,4,5,6, etc); even / odd numbers; multiplication and division; and more. The real creativity comes when boxes arrive unpainted, leaving you to color them in with the correct colors. Color them incorrectly, and you'll be solving puzzles that don't exist, meaning your entire grid will be incorrect! Some times, you may have puzzles without any equations; other times, an entire 9x9 grid may consist of nothing but less than or greater than symbols! The difficulty level amps up until you are solving two grids simultaneously, with factors up to 9.There is no time limit, the colors are vibrant, and the music that is here is soothing and ambient. It's casual puzzle solving at its best. There is truly nothing else like it, and it remains a classic...for those of us who actually know about it. Some people, like myself, are still playing it years later, and you'll not solve the 20,000 included puzzles (not randomly generated, by the way) any time soon.  Even better, it can be played with one hand, for those times when my grandson falls asleep on my lap!At less than $5 US, there is not a single puzzle game on Steam that offers this much game time per penny. Highly, highly recommended.Puzzle fans: Join the new  Puzzle Lovers Steam Group, and get bundle and sales info, contact with game developers, contests and more! ",739,382,25,94,84,12,144

												So glad this game is available again, its the greatest newspaper-style puzzler to come about since sudoku.  literally more puzzles than I could fathom are contained within this game, ranging in difficulty from ""bash your head against the keyboard to win""  to ""bash your fists against the keyboard becuase **** this is hard"", however mistakes are never punished, and you can artificially decrease the difficulty at any point (automatically hide unavaialbe options for this row or column), or even ask for hints.I've sunk more enjoyable hours into this game than I have into 99% of my steam library, its a fun way to unwind.  There are so many puzzles. the difficulty curve is very gentle, but it ramps up to the near impossible.  If you dont like impossible puzzles, dont worry there are tens of thousands of easier puzzles.A great rainy afternoon game for when you're taking a break from HL2.exe engine games.

I have to recommend it, because...*whispering* ..its brilliant. So I spent couple of hours and I was playing it.. ye..really playing it. Strange in this Idling Age. Some kinds of puzzles are unique, I didnt play something like this before. I like this game, its nice, simple and rules are clear. I am prefer listening my music or something from youtube - sounds are fine. Puzzles which can be compared to sudoku are in the last region. - I wish only kindly recommend to add some button what allow me to fullfil all cages - when there will be only one solution. I am usually boring when I see one solution and has to manually fullfiling whole grid, what is a bit .. *cough* wasting my time? .):goldenpiece:  4.75/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant Sudoku remix. It was taken off the Steam store for about a year, and it’s finally back, so get it before something happens again.If you're an OCD completionist gamer or achievement hunter, however, stay far away. You'll need at least 1000 hours to complete every puzzle. And easily over 100 hours just to get all the achievements. So just be aware of what you’re getting into.But if you like Sudoku and want to see the formula turned on its head in dozens of ways, don't think twice. Grab it. Really great way to keep your mind in shape, even just by playing for a few minutes every day. The word ""Everyday"" in the title is there for a reason.			",311,69,5,34,15,2,47

												Oh man I had forgotten about this game, it is a great casual math puzzler similar in style to a SudokuExcept, as you can see in the screenshots there are a bunch of differently shaped colored areas like someone just won at tetris.  Each colored area has a ""rule"" associated with it (you can see those in the screenshots also); for example you might have to make a 4-tiled ""L"" shape's numbers multiply all together and equal 36.  Or rule might be that the area can only contain even numbers. You have to use each number once per column and once per row; once you fill in a tile it automatically removes that number from the rest of the row/column for you.   As the game gets harder the rules get a bit more complex, the areas get larger, some tiles won't have the color filled in, you'll have to use your brain to figure the colors/rules, THEN the numbers for each tile.  There's really no penalty for putting the wrong number in a tile except for your ""shortest number of moves to complete this one"" personal best ego boost.  I also feel it does a very good job of explaining and working each new rule/aspect of gameplay as it is incorporated into the rising difficulty.  By hovering over a tile, if the rule for it's area is known, all possible solutions are shown to you so you really don't have to be super good at math; this is a logic game that uses math as a tool not as a requirement to play.  I happen to like math so I never had to use the displayed possible solutions very often but I admit there were times when it saved me a headache and the game doesn't make you feel bad about it, it displays this for every tile you hover over on purpose so you don't have to feel the pressure of MATH.Overall a fun casual puzzle game that combines simple math, 'sudoku' style numberplay, and logical processes of elimination.  I think the screenshots showing the puzzles will help pull this review together, highly suggest taking another look if this review sounds interesting.			",243,70,10,59,23,5,25

												Brilliant puzzle game. Entertaining and challenging.When you first start you might think, if this is it then Im quickly done. The game becomes more difficult gradually until you come to a point where you notice you are actually challenged to solve the puzzle. The variations on the same theme are big with increasing levels of difficulty. I'm currently 7hrs into the game and haven't even completed all the 12 intro levels of every stage. There are 5 stages in total which all are increasing in difficulty. The first stage is a 4x4 grid, then 5x5, etc. Within every stage you get a couple of variations on the theme. The amount of puzzles and depth you get is huge for the amount this game costs.Would recommend to every puzzle enthousiast			",816,368,35,100,121,10,162

												As avid suduko fan and lover of math this game is everything I could ask for. Even if you're neither of those things, if you enjoy puzzles I'd still give this a shot, it is an A+ puzzle game with an incredibly long shelf life. Almost 120 hours in and I still haven't gotten that final region achievement. Really glad to see this back in the store, I remember it being taken out not too long after I first bought it. It does crash for me alot though? On both my old windows 7 laptop and my new windows 10 one. So I find myself exiting puzzles every once in a while just to save my progress.

												An extremely clever puzzle game that uses basic math as a rule set from which to construct brilliant and sometimes diabolical logic puzzles with an ever-escalating complexity and challenge. The variety of puzzle types is substantial, the actual number of included puzzles is functionally infinite (seriously, in the tens of thousands), and most importantly there's a huge sense of satisfaction in solving the more complicated puzzles. It's incredible value for the meager cost, and a must-own for any fan of logic puzzles.			",234,75,15,58,62,3,100

												I'm normally not one to write a recommendation for a particular game in my library; my tastes are quite diverse and everyone else's tastes are different. However, Square Logic is a unique game with a unique place in my gaming heart. It is a puzzle game in its purest form: no animated characters, no falling objects, no globs of goo, no skeletons in the closet, and no laws of physics... but most definitely rules of math.  If you don't know how to add, subtract, multiply or divide, you will have trouble with this game. (If you can't count to 9, you'll have even more trouble, but for that you can watch Sesame Street.) Square Logic is a perfect game to give your brain a daily dose of exercise, a mental twice-around-the-block if you will. Some people will argue such a workout will help you think better in all aspects of your life. To me, it's just fun.The game forum will provide more feedback from those who have already joined the Square Logic addiction. See you in the Beyond!			",1567,678,52,253,210,17,346

												It's pretty much exactly what it looks like.  Sudoku except sectioned off into areas of differing sizes and shapes that follow a variety of rules instead of exactly nine blocks that contain the numbers 1-9.  Also most of the grids in this game are smaller than 9x9.  Some puzzles have you work on two grids at the same time, too.There's thousands of puzzles available to complete, so if you never get tired of it this collection will last you years probably.Achievement hunters beware: the last achievement will take a long, long time.

												It's a pretty easy and chill puzzle game, but far more suitable for some portable device, while sitting in the bathroom or a meeting.  I finished the first two tiers, and am pretty done with it.  It does keep it interesting by adding new mechanics regularly.  For the price I paid (a couple bucks), it was certainly worth it.

												My playtime is not accurate for this game, FYI. First play the HexCells series before you invest in this. They are very similiar, yet much better. This game is more focused on numbers, and mathematical operations. Graphics are real meh - almost subpar. Music is meh. Game play is fun, in a casual coffee-break kind of way. Somewhat addicting.I would almost add that there seem to be too many levels, as well. For example, for each challenge I finished, I unlocked nearly 800 levels. Ain't nobody got time for that. Thankfully you can just 'skip to the main boss challenge thing'. Once again, HexCells gets around this with random levels (hence, infinite).I wish there was a 'maybe' option, but for this title I will give it a thumbs up with the caveat that you know what you are getting into. Its fairly cut-and-dried.			",565,163,5,75,79,8,72

												This is a great puzzle game that is a combination math puzzle and Sudoku. Even better is that it starts off easy and then gets harder, with more interesting challenges and variations as the levels increase. There are probably hundreds of hours of play in this game. I bought it 6 years ago after reading a glowing recommendation on Jonathan Blow's blog (he's the creator of Braid and the upcoming The Witness). This is probably the only game in my Steam library that my both my wife and 80-year old father in law enjoy. They love Sudoku but this is so much better.			",161,53,2,25,19,3,37

												This is a kenken or kendoku game: it is similar to the game of sudoku but involves more math. If that doesn't scare you off, then SquareLogic has some truly fun and challenging puzzles, being just different enough in approach from sudoku to offer a different experience. I realize not everyone here is a puzzle (or a math) fan, so I'll note that there's a demo version you can try out to see if it is your kind of game (though the demo doesn't really let you get into any of the difficult puzzles, IIRC).

												A lot has been covered about this game already, so I'll contribute what new points I can.  First off, I was hesitant about this game.  Seemed too simplistic, wasn't sure if it would offer enough of a challenge and thought it might, maybe sit on my list unplayed and forgotten.  Months later, this has become my most played game on PC.  (Don't trust my 'hours played' number: I mostly play it on my laptop when I have no connection.)There are THOUSANDS of puzzles for you to take on in this game.  They all work off of the same basic concept, with some fun little variations (such as working with two interconnected boards that share the same answers, but different formulas).  Each one offers a new challenge though and with time you pick up on the patterns and logical shortcuts that you may have missed before.As for difficulty, you really can make it as easy or difficult as you want.  There is no ""real"" penalty for just guessing every single box.  So, if, for some bizarre reason, you want to just barrel through guessing the whole way, you can.  Or, if you're like me, you can aim to finish each puzzle WELL below the Par number of moves with no mistakes and only the bare minimum use of the right-click-to-hide-invalid-numbers function.  If you're extremely sharp and/or have too much free time, you can also hide the box that shows the possible solution combinations.  Not an issue when you're dealing with two or three boxes, but at five or six it becomes a little more impractical; even with the solutions, you still have the challenge of figuring out the logical placement of everything.  You could be at a single puzzle for hours.If you use a laptop like I do, you'll also probably appreciate the low demand it will place on your battery and system resources.  Makes for many hours of what we nerds consider ""fun.""			",36,2,1,5,2,0,5

												The interface looks a bit odd if you just look at the screenshots but it works remarkably well when you're using it. All the numbers are big enough so you can fully concentrate on the math/logic in your head and not on having to pixel-perfect click on the right numbers. Very quickly you'll find yourself in ""the zone"" clicking away and moving to the next puzzle.The game mechanics are simple, just click on the number you know must be correct and the same number will disappear in the rest of the row/column.When you know a number can't possibly be in a certain square you can right-click on that number to hide it. Eventually you’ll end up with all squares filled with the correct number.These are fast-paced math puzzles (don't worry, without a timer) and you have thousands  of puzzles to choose from in a variety of configurations, all organized in groups from easy/medium/hard. You will not run out of puzzles any time soon and it's a great way to pass the time doing mental gymnastics.p.s. The solutions on the right hand side can be turned off in the settings in case you also find them to make the puzzles too easy, at least in the first couple of locations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a kenken or kendoku game: it is similar to the game of sudoku but involves more math. If that doesn't scare you off, then SquareLogic has some truly fun and challenging puzzles, being just different enough in approach from sudoku to offer a different experience. I realize not everyone here is a puzzle (or a math) fan, so I'll note that there's a demo version you can try out to see if it is your kind of game (though the demo doesn't really let you get into any of the difficult puzzles, IIRC).
