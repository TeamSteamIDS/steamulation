												Did you ever want to play Carcassone in Bob the Builder style? Then this is a game for you.You have to manage a way for your trucks across the map, while your competitors do the same.. all the while trying to sabotage your roadway and transports. Therefore are two main types of utilities you can use. One are the road types from normal road to bridge and tunnels, which your trucks use, while the others are destructive tools to sabotage your opponents, these range from dynamite, nails up to police controls, emp bombs, radar and much more.The gameplay is made up to four players at one map, while it can already get quite hectic with only two players, while you try to keep the balance between sabotaging and guarding your own. While there are some single player maps (which the first 8 mainly work as a tutorial) the main game is the multiplayer part against other human opponents.Conclusio:As one game usually doesnt take too long, for a quick play against some friends this can be quite a fun distraction.Note: This game was reviewed with a key given by the developers ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting idea for a strategic game, simple and effective. You have a factory and your quest is simple, get a few trucks on the opposite side of the map, but its more difficult than you think. You have to build roads, bridges, tunnels and send trucks, easy, on the other side beating competing companies with the same focus as you is not the easiest task, on the larger maps when everybody launches rockets, EMPs, sets up bombs or another obstacles on the roads makes this game much more interesting and enjoyable. This game's singleplayer is a real challenge I must admit, and developers stood up to their words easy to learn, complex to master. The game offers also multiplayer with few wellknown mods lie tower defence. DETOUR's MP could be impressive with a few friends to play with. 5.5 /10 ",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												Detour claims to be an addictive competitive real time strategy game, however, I would say almost none of that is true.There is not much strategy involved aside from 'build roads everywhere you can to block everyone' (Goldmines first so you can afford to keep blocking them), and 'throw explosives at the other players'. When dealing with a strategy game, I tend to want more than that. So I can not say it is good at that. As for competitive, don't bother. It does not have a lot of skill involved aside from who can build the fastest(Which in itself is a matter of being the fastest at clicking). There is very little here that would be competitive, or that would draw anyone wishing to be competitive. There are way better things out there.Addictive? Definitely not. Play it once, maybe twice. Third time with friends and then you´ve seen it all. There is nothing to come back for, and I would say it is severely lacking in replay value.At least it is realtime, and with 4 players throwing explosives it is chaotic so you can at least count that as a plus if you enjoy that sort of thing. For the single player challenges, they do take some effort, though the 'humour' involed in it is certainly not my kind. You are essentially challenged by a bunch of stereotypes which eventually end up teaming up on you. And then it just sort of ends.Detour is a game that sounds good in theory, but just doesn't cut it in practice. Maybe it was a good idea on the idea board that just didn't get fleshed out right, maybe they just lacked the skill or knowledge to make it work. But either way I would recommend against buying Detour - Your time is more valuable than any sale price			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												First of all, my original review ""Why is this game real?"" was read by Senpai Studios, so when the update came out, they told me. So, this is my real review, since the game was fixed and is now functional.5/10 - Functional, but boring. Not good enough to really be a positive review, but not horribly negative.Ok, so the basic gameplay is building roads to get a truck across the map to the other side. At this point, this works well, and has no design flaws. The bridge is a bit confusing to use, and should have adjustable length, but that's just a minor quip. The dynamite and other explosives can be used to destroy the enemy's roads to prevent progress. The dynamite is quite a core part of gameplay, but the larger missile-thing can be used too frequently to be considered balanced. The AI takes advantage of this, and so did my living opponent. This is a bit gamebreaking at times, and needs to be addressed.In terms of ""story,"" since there isn't REALLY much of a story, it was kind of offensive to certain groups. There are jokes making fun of transsexuals, activists, construction workers, the player, cops, and those weird African characters in anime that look like creepy magicians or something. What really bothered me was how they made it very obvious in some, such as the character ""Tranny"" who has a male-esque voice, and the construction boss guy acts awkward around her. He says he dated her and then he... Cuts off what he's saying. This is just an example of it, but the offensive nature of the NPCs doesn't really detract from the gameplay, though it's a bit irritating. I doubt this is persistent for most people, so this is something to think about.Next, bugs. Even though the menus were supposedly fixed, they are a bit broken after changing the resolution and not restarting. This was a bit weird, especially when I was just confronted about the update, but I figured it out. Then, there's the audio bug. For some reason, when I had just installed the game, there was no music on the menu, while the music played in-game. When I checked the audio settings, both SFX and music were fully muted, but... Well... They weren't. This was fixed by moving the sliders back and forth. The game crashed one time, but that's really to be expected. There were weird connectivity glitches, where I would connect to someone, then they wouldn't be in the game, but I would remain in the lobby. This, and the lack of players, makes multiplayer pretty pointless, especially since it's the purpose of the game.The gameplay, as I explained before, is pretty straightforward. However, it isn't fun, or stressful in a good way. It is bland, whenever the AI doesn't just target you, making it extremely frustrating to try to play, when it isn't so easy it takes no work. I either hard to struggle and lose for no good reason, or I had no competition. In one game, a bit farther along, one AI character didn't even do anything at all, and no, its area wasn't under the FoW at the time.Beyond the broken AI, the gameplay just isn't that fun to begin with. Maybe other people would love DETOUR, but personally, I don't like it. So, if you want to purchase this game, consider what I said, but take it with a grain of salt, and just do what you want to, in terms of buying this game.			",196,33,3,36,28,0,29

												A simple premise, get your truck safely from your factory to the finish line, pave roads, attack and defend from competitors while always keeping an eye on your credits make DETOUR a fun strategy experience that is probably best played with friends. The AI in the single player missions called challenges is a bit hit & miss but does it's job well in getting you acquainted with the games mechanics. Multiplayer missions can  be played with AI oponents (3 adjustable difficulty levels).			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												DETOUR could have been a neat little game, but the interface is clunky and its very one sided. In single player, the AI targets only you. In the 10th level, there are 3 AI opponents that target just you, even when an AI opponent who is about to win. Its unwinnable, no matter what I do. It seems like the single player is just broken or you're not supposed to progress. The multiplayer portion of this game is dead and is half of the available achievements, so good luck getting those. If they would fix it, it could be a fun little game, but as it is, I can not recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game... this game is fairly decent. To kick things off, your objective is simple: to get (x) number of trucks over to the other side of the map from where you start from, typically using roads.Simple right? But that's where things can start getting silly with the different mechanics built in to the game - explosives, bombs, EMPs, policemen etc. While I originally bought this game as a joke while it was on sale, I'm impressed by how well it actually turned out to be. While the game interestingly does incorporate several RTS features (fog of war for instance), it does lack some others (the fact that you can't send barrage an area without line of sight bewilders me a little) and speed and agility is crucial in this game.I've seen some people take issue with the game's slightly child-like graphics and some bad and lame jokes but hey... for a game less than a few dollars, there isn't much to complain about.

DETOUR is an RTS. You build roads to lead your trucks to the finish line while the enemy team does the same. You can disrupt each other with things like missiles and sentry turrets.ControlsSince it's a top down perspective game, you have camera controls which are the WASD keys and mouse to place your buildings and roads. Navigating through different buildables is a hassle. They're categorized into roads, aggressive offensive weapons like missiles, placeable weapons like turrets and truck upgrades. The buildables have each their own hotkeys. It's extremely hectic.SoundsThe music is awful. It's generic and gets really annoying after a while. On top of that, the music usually doesn't fit the mood. While I was given a briefing during the tutorial, the song was intense and felt like it was out of an action movie. When playing a multiplayer free-for-all game, the song reminded me of a calm spring afternoon with its peaceful piano melody.Sound effects were not as terrible. Pretty regular stuff if you ask me. Lifeless without much spice but did its job.GraphicsHorrible. The menus seem to be work in progress. The font choice is bad, text starts from wherever and server browser is a background image of a table with text on top which doesn't even line up with the background. It doesn't help that white is a dominant color and the text is not outlined with a darker color.In-game graphics are simplistic and nothing like the standards today. GUI looks like a mess with garbage visual appearance and placing. Maps are squares in an empty space. Objects are placed on a grid on the square. Effects are simple and nothing looks special. It's dull and unpleasant to look at.BalanceNon-existent. Some maps are not balanced fairly to all players. Some maps are symmetrical and some have three player bases on one side and the last player sits alone in one corner. The AI is either not challenging or already sending its second truck while you're pondering where the second road tile should go to. Everything has a low cooldown so things like missiles can be launched almost constantly. Money doesn't really seem to run out because everything is quite cheap. Though, you can change the income rate and starting cash but I went with defaults.OtherThe broken lobbies. I wasn't sure what was going on first but nothing seems to work properly. It's like that old 1960's TV which you had to give a good whack on the side to make it show clear image. When you select a color, it changes randomly. Sometimes the ready button doesn't work at all. Some game modes can't have more than one player. In a coop mode. Which specifically says ""up to three other players"". Random players could join spots that I had set as ""Friends only"", ""Invite only"" and ""Closed"". There are four gamemodes. I only had the chance to play one. Free-For-All.In conclusion, it's a small RTS with an interesting idea but it feels like it wasn't finished. Barely functioning multiplayer options, generic music, low standard graphics and unbalanced gameplay. It's supposed to be a hectic game and that it is, I must give credit. The game is extremely cheap from the sales but I don't think it was really worth the time or money.I don't recommend DETOUR. ",383,64,3,29,20,3,44

												""Did you ever want to play Carcassone in Bob the Builder style?"" Well, I did. Disappointed with myself for not reading other reviews.From the moment I saw the main menu, I realised I'd made a mistake. Although the videos show a simple graphical style, which I'm fine with, playing the game is unpleasant with an underlying feeling of clunkiness and a lack of polish. As you can see, I only managed about an hour of trying the first dozen challenges and a couple of multiplayer attempts to realise that there was no great strategising or clever path of progression to choose how you'll win a map - only a certain level of reflexes and spamming keys.Sad that a path game failed because it's too darn linear.

												The writing is full of jokes that would only appeal to ten year olds and is awkward at best, offensive at worst.. The presentation is very lacking and doesn't show any thought put into it. Text is misaligned, menus take up too much space, buttons are too similar so it is hard to differentiate between them at first. There isn't really a good aesthetic going on here. The game is clunky, the mechanics do not make sense due to fog of war. This essentially blocks out all actions across the map. First you need visibility before you can send a bomb. However, the AI doesn't seem to have the same constraint making it a very frustrating experience.The difficulty in single player is either way too easy, or way to difficult (when you basically enter a 3v1 scenario)Might be better in Multiplayer, but i doubt it.

												This game is a stressful-click-fest, what i mean by that is: its a race to build a road from one corner of the map to another and then spam bombs at your enemies road. Simple as that. The faster you are at collecting money the faster you can spam bombs. Game has a RTS feel/stress to it but with no strategy behind it. At first glance seemed like a fun game, if the PvP element would be taken out. Adding that extra flavor takes away from the experience. Seems like it would do better as a timed puzzle solver. Is it fun? Yeah but it does have a learning curve. Not for the casual gamer. I dont see myself sinking the amount of hours that is needed to master the game or complete it when there are other games out there that did this concept better or have a  better system. Do I recommended? If you are a strategy fan, yes but buy it when on sale and get the 4pack and give some to your friends, at least you will all be on the same skill level and not go online and immediately be attacked by some one that cant run beefier games and all they play is this.

DETOUR is a difficult game to review, it has some excellent aspects but also a number of flaws that need addressing. Again, due-to the lack of a ""Mixed"" option for recommendations, I'll ultimately go for ""Yes"" as the good features of this game outweigh the bad ones. DETOUR is a refreshing addition to the RTS genre, the goal is to escort a certain number of trucks to the opposite end of the map by any means necessary. Construct a safe passage overcoming all kinds of obstacles, including enemy players doing anything they can to hinder your progress at the same time. A nice and simple concept that plays out fairly well once you get the hang of things. The game is fun in short bursts, things can get challenging and hectic quite quickly depending on the number of players on the map at hand, this makes for some great gameplay from time to time, but can be just as frustrating too. Micromanagement is key.For me the number one problem with DETOUR is the interface, which is one of the most (if not THE most) important aspect of any RTS game. Things are simply not clear enough, and when the gameplay is hectic and there is so much going on at once, there is little time to spend glaring at the icons and making sure you are selecting and building the correct things, it's not uncommon to end up building something completely different to what you were actually aiming for because icons are small, unclear and similar-looking. The Missiles for example are the main culprit here. This could be improved upon a lot, even simply by making the icons larger, clearer and adding some visible text on the images themselves, the hotkeys could also use some revision as they feel all over the place right now.There isn't much singleplayer content in DETOUR either as of the moment, and with so few people playing online, you'll find that you'll run out of things to do relatively quickly. It's a shame that the online lobbies are empty all of the while because this games full potential probably lies within facing off against human opponents instead of the predictable AI. So, do I recommend DETOUR? Yes, but it barely makes it as a positive review. The game is interesting and refreshing enough for me to recommend to any fans of the RTS genre, despite the clunky and confusing interface. Don't jump into DETOUR expecting one of the best games ever made, because it's far from it, but I'd say it's worth trying at least once. If you can round up some friends to play this game with you, you'll definitely have a better time with it than you will on the singleplayer missions, which are decent as tutorial stages at least.

												DETOUR is an RTS game which focuses around building your highways and destroying your enemies' highways before they're able to send any of their delivery trucks. The game is pretty okay, first thing I've noticed it the nice interactive menu which changes with some graphic changes but also shakes when trucks pass by. The disappointment however was seeing how low the System Requirements were, but it still lagged. I had to switch to system cursor as it was laggy and the graphics options were scarce to begin with. I also noticed a lot of lag spikes when bombs were launched. The first missions were extremely easy and most of the times there's a loophole around them. Either be it just using bombs and continuously sending your trucks, or dynamiting the enemy's road. It's pretty simple. But then I reached a point where I got constantly nuked, which was really frustrating. The AI seems to have it much easier and the difficulties don't scale too well. Graphically speaking it's ""okay"" for an RTS, but the character heads that speak looks too childish and the sound the main person keeps making is pretty annoying. I can't complain much about the music, though. The UI however is somewhat confusing and takes time to get used to where is which item, making you lose essential time and potentially the match as well. Another thing to mention is the way you select items and the way you get the description should be reworked. I'd expect hovering over the item with my mouse gives me details and pressing on it will select it, but it works otherwise which disappoints me because it's really hard to understand what the item is by looking at it. I haven't noticed any bugs except for where it doesn't simply allow me to build somewhere and it doesn't specify why. All in all, if you're fan of RTS you can try this one out as it offers kind of a twist to the genre but there are better titles out there. Unless you're on a really tight budget as it gets cheap on sale. I wouldn't, however, recommend it at full price.>I'd give it a 7/10>Pros: Lots of levels, the objectives and the way the game functions are different than the usual,  multiplayer, cards and achievements, it has potential to be a good game.>Cons: Needs a rework on the UI, needs more optimization, better AI and/or fix the loopholes allowing for easy level clearing, annoying voicing.

One round they do almost nothing at a turtle's pace.  The the next they almost build full map in under 10 seconds.  Finally, the controls are painful at times to use.  I didn't get to try multiplayer, and because of lockups won't be giving it another go.- Hard lockups (not my pc here)- AI bad, either too slow or too fast- Controls are painfulP.S.

												When I looked at this game, I saw a interesting looking RTS so i got it (on a 54p deal for a four pack) and I played the tutorial. I was enjoying myself (despite having to need to switch the inverted up & down and then a friend said: Hey, lets do a multiplayer match! I said: Sure. Things went downhill. I hosted a server and then my friend couldn't join that server, We tried vice versa and we couldn't join eachover. THEN when my friend actually made a server that we all could join, some random dude strolls along and joins AFTER WE HAD MADE THE SPACE A INVITE ONLY. In the end, we managed to play the game together and I crashed for no visual reason. To sum up:Pros:- Nice interesting gameplay- Gives a tutorial and a How To PlayCons:- No effort of lobby creation and joining- Random crashes- Not a lot of early game tutorial detail (had to look up how to rotate a block)- Almost impossible to play a game with friends without good internet connection- Multiplayer is a strange thing in DETOUR- DETOUR doesn't need to be caps guys!Had a lot of potential but needs MAJOR polish in the multiplayer			",96,17,0,4,21,1,15

YouTube™ Video: Detour - Let's Play 

			Views: 92		

			A challenging game of placing roads to get a truck to the other side of the map. Really.		

If I hadn't gotten this game for 19 cents, I would be really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's not that it's bad, it's actually pretty good, but it gets frustrating and boring quickly. It is fun with friends but after 20 minutes the novelty wears off and you're left with a rather shallow game.			",322,87,10,41,60,1,59

												UPDATE June 2 2015: The game has been recently updated with an improved interface, apparently in response to this review.  I have not had a chance yet to revisit it yet though.Old Review:The concept is good, but this game is really let down by its awkward interface.  You can't select things with the mouse but rather have to use the scrollwheel to make each selection or memorise the number shortcuts.  Considering the gameplay can be hectic, an efficient interface is critical so it's a pity Detour doesn't have one.			",1161,450,68,160,175,13,272

												This game is worth the 12.5c my friend paid for it, and not a penny more. Menus are confusing and bugged. Turret defense says it's multiplayer but it's a ""typo"".  This game has potential, but it's far from it - feels like a very rough draft of a game.			",112,16,2,8,3,0,7

												Neat idea with poor execution. This game could be a lot of fun, but I'm still trying to figure out if the developers have even tried playing the game. The interface is clunky. Hot keys change your selection but don't take action. For instance you use WASD to move your view around the map and one of the most important tools, sensor sweep, is mapped to F2. Makes sense - your fingers are already in that general vicinty, however pressing F2 doesn't do the sensor sweep, it just makes the sensor sweep the selected action. You then have to hit the enter key which is clear across the keyboard from F2. For single player, the first real mission after training is, as far as i can tell, unbeatable. AI opponents with no truck goals will target you, even if you also have no goals, over the AI opponent who is about to win. I tried several different strategies to foil the AI, including not completing my final road segment until a truck just needs that last segment; still no good. Learned all of the hot keys (such as they are) and the speedup still wasn't enough. I outspend all of the AIs, I nuke the AIs whenever I can... doesn't matter. There are 3 of them and one of you. There are a bunch more single player missions after that, but I've not seen them. The single player is just broken.For multiplayer... my son and I played a few games, and while it was a little fun, the turret balance is completely off. Offensive turrets fire too fast and have too much health. They aren't taken out with a nuke and they can destroy roads as fast as you can build them. Defensive turrets are way too weak to be effective and the game quickly becomes an offensive turret race. It's cute for a little while, but quickly becomes boring.I don't feel ripped off, I had about 1 hour of fun and the game was incredibly inexpensive; I am disappointed that a laundry list of seemingly simple and obvious improvements are still missing that could make this a reasonably fun game.

												Dc: Got a review copy. A nice little game for the friends of tug-of-war type of RTS games.  Technically quite a solid game. Key shortcuts work reasonably well and when action becomes frantic they better be learnt and used well as at least for me the AI gave pretty stiff resistance in the campaigns that followed the lengthy tutorial. UI could use some improvement though too. Not enough funds -event could use a better effect to show the user that what was requested did not get built. Message log could be placed differently as my eyes are mostly fixed on what i am trying to do and on the credit balance. Have not seen anyone playing this in multiplayer. that is a shame as this game could be really interesting to try against live opponents as the chaos is just like made for a game to play with (soon to be former) friends.

												I got a 4-pack of this game for 39 cents back in a sale, that should explain this game.Pros:+are there even any?Cons:-the concept feels weird and just bad (you just race against a player or a cpu as to who will build a road and transfer stuff to the other side-the singleplayer part is bad. You know, if the game is so bad, maybe they've implemented great jokes? No. They are not even funny (and offensive humor is my type of humor), they are just plain terrible and offensive.-it looks pretty badly, it's not even a unique artstyle, just purely bad graphicsOverall, don't buy this. Just don't. The best thing you'll end up with (if you get lucky) is making a profit through the trading cards. A total waste of 39 cents.			",121,37,2,10,13,2,4

												Nice little game where you have to build roads and get 3 trucks across before your opponent does. Cute graphics, the avatars are a bit childish though. And the game is more focused on the multiplayer than the singleplayer (the game kinda prepares you for multiplayer through the singleplayer missions). If you keep that in mind there's a lot of fun to be had here.[Rating: 72/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

Budget Multiplayer Game[Buy only when heavily discounted]A simple game with a simple premiseOverview:Detour is an anti-tower defense game in the vein of Sim CIty. Players are able to build roads for their own trucks and lead them to the opposite end of the map before their opponents do. Players are also able to use their arsenals in order to obstruct their opponents' way. Pros:+ Cheap price+ Simple+ Sim CIty with simple RTS elements+ Multiplayer funCons:- Lacks RTS elements. While it's true that you have to be agile in order to win the game, the RTS part is nothing more than throwing missiles at others.- Not much single player options. Custom maps with AI should be added in order to add replay value for people who are unable to play online.- Sometimes, cursor disappears when selecting roads. Forcing player to select another option first to make the cursor appear again.- The AI on the single player campaign mostly work together to obstruct the player.Score : 6/10 ",735,217,8,89,52,8,49

It reminded me of trying online games were all other players had a lot experience and did optimized mikromanagement while I was just checking the gameplay.Additionally the control is blown up with constraints to make the game more complex.So: to simple to be a complex strategic game and to complex and hectic to be a good puzzle game.

												I had a hard time rating this game down because it has great potential. I found the strategy to be fantastic. You really have to be on your toes from the very beginning when facing a full table. There are a few specific reasons as to why I wouldn't recommend this game.When playing against NPC's it appears to be really easy for them to all gang up on you. The atomic bomb refreshes quickly and it is really one of the best ways to hinder your opponent. Getting hit by three at once really sets you back. The issue is that you play a match and at a certain point you can't even keep track of what you are building to what is being destroyed and that leads in to another issue I have.The field of view is really small for this game. I couldn't zoom out to see everything and the game has you going back and forth between checking on player progress/launching bombs to building up. If the view was better than the game would be manageable. If the AI was improved to be more balanced and it was easier to manage the game then this would be a slam dunk of a RTS. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first it begins like a puzzle builder game, but after the tutorial levels it gets in some kind of panic mode. It reminded me of trying online games were all other players had a lot experience and did optimized mikromanagement while I was just checking the gameplay.Additionally the control is blown up with constraints to make the game more complex.So: to simple to be a complex strategic game and to complex and hectic to be a good puzzle game.

												You build roads over maps and try to get fixed number of trucks to other side before your rival and hope they won't mess you up. Simple and fun with some funny characters and moment, I did enjoy this game! It has multiplayer too so that was nice add and had some good laughs with that.

												I totally get what this game was going for, but it really missed the mark. The basic premise is that you just need to build a road from one side of a map to the other while preventing your opponent from doing the same. The problem is that the controls are fairly clunky so it's hard to make quick decisions. I wouldn't play this unless you really, really like real-time strategy and can tolerate repetitiveness.

												While this isn't a sort of game I expect to find on Steam, I was somewhat surprised at how much I enjoyed playing DETOUR.Sempai Studios had given me a free key (thank you) and while it took me a while to get around to playing it (sorry!) this ended up being a remedy to what ended up being a particularly painful recovery day.DETOUR reminds me a lot of the PC board games I used to play as a 90s little girl when I wasn't quite into bigger gaming. You've got the main goal (reach the end) and you have to go up against the AI with varying levels of difficulty. It's not difficult in theory. The farther you progress, the more power ups you earn. Building and power ups take points. Patience is rewarded but patience can be what causes your bitter defeat.You're not going to be too entirely impressed with the artwork of the characters you meet in this game. The characters are very cartoony in style, but for something I'd call a time management board game, I don't find that part too important. You might. You need to know this. The actual playing field looks like your average grid filled with general pixelated grass, cityscape, rubble, etc. It's not entirely impressive. It's there. It's your playing field and it's enough for me.Personally, I had a little bit of issue with relying on my mouse so there seemed to be something slowing me down with clicking on things. I'm not sure if it was because I'm unused to seeing an orange cone as my pointer or if there were actual mouse problems. I ended up being pretty happy to use the keyboard when I could. Clicking wasn't always my friend in this game.Otherwise, I really enjoyed myself. The games are very short to play and they are made so that a lot of action happens at once. There are a few unique personalities to deal with, but otherwise there's not really much of a story there. It's more like a bland, shell of a story. It's more like the sort of stories you're expecting from time management games you download to kill an hour from a certain website that has a lot of HOGs. You get a few laughs from some of the text and you proceed to simply play the game. That's how it works.Some players may find this boring and stop after the first part of the game, as yes, the easy section of the game is easy to blow through. You could purchase this for friends during the Summer Sale and use this just for playing against friends. This is a good choice if you're not into anything with gore (though most of us are, guilty as charged). Then again, those of us who are board game addicts (also guilty as charged) might enjoy this, too.Of course then there's taking joy in finding ways to completely obliterate your opponent and dominate the field so they can't build. Being that sadistic is a sort of joy that comes from the game, as is the quick win or the slow and agonizing type of defeat. It's not hard to win, it's just the matter of how to get there. You'll learn, but it's about thinking quickly and ensuring there will be a victory.It's a game I'll likely revisit from time to time because you can pick it up and put it down. Though I'd rather give this a sort of lukewarm rating, what tips it over is I did like it and I'll certainly be playing during my ""I AM JUST SO BORED!"" between treatments and napping.Your handicap and health issues: The graphics can get a little bit bright and sometimes blink. I've got a mild headache after playing, but nothing too serious. Caution. Danger Will Robinson.			",23,23,0,5,9,0,0

												Nice concept and gameplay, but it lacks something.It's kind of boring.The goal to deliver 3 trucks while sabotage and disrupt the enemy is not interesting (for me).Sorry, it's a matter of taste.The graphic is a bit off. The devs should have used better fonts. The font is too standard.Font types make a huge difference in a game.This game's font really let me down...Another objects are... acceptable...The truck and the other icons are good I suppose, but the main menu is bad.The description of the button is great. The devs describe each button well.The achievements are for multiplayer game, so I can't get 'em.I'm forever alone :steamsad:Not recommended if you hunts achievement and play alone.So, overall, I don't recommend this game for the full price.It's recommended when it is on sale over 90%.

												Detour is a real-time strategy game. It's an enjoyable and simple strategy game with quite good and clean looking graphics. The main objective is to get your trucks from base to the opposite side. The AI (Bot) is pretty easy and worthless and the story isn't compelling. But, with the great music, outstanding writing, chaotic gameplay and extremely cheap price tag, this game definitely feels like it’s worth to try.Game: 6.5/10Graphic: 6.0/10100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard			",244,94,11,24,16,0,27

-Quick Review-DETOUR is a real-time highway-simulator strategy-game developed by Sandswept Studios. The objective can be summed up as “get this truck across the finish line, on the other side of the map”. DETOUR gets increasingly complex with weapons, buildings, and opposing AI or Human Players (in Multiplayer).

			This guy isn't Creasely or whatever he said his name was. I Atratzu, hereby dub thee ""Bob-the-not-builder"".		


As you progress through the game you are faced with different NPC's who are competing with you to get their trucks across the finish line. Sometimes they're all facing the same direction, other times you're pitted head-to-head with 3 NPC's against you.Gameplay: DETOUR itself starts out very simple, and attempts to teach you the basic concepts as you play through, although the explanations are quite wordy and I concluded “I'll learn the hard way, I don't feel like reading”. (Yes, yes, shame on me. I didn't feel like dealing with Bob-the-not-builder's putting me down even though I did nothing but succeed for the company! *spit*)As in most real-time strategy games, you reach a point where you can no longer click fast enough to compete, so you need to learn the keyboard shortcuts to keep up with the other players/AI. Unfortunately the keyboard short cuts are 1234567890 and some of the “F1-F2-F3-etc.” keys.There are four categories of “build-able” objects; Roads, Trucks, Weapons, and Buildings. Roads are are used to cross different map terrain. Various truck upgrades can be purchased to speed up or defend your trucks. Weapons can be used to destroy, or impede other players/AI progress. And Buildings are limited but you can build ground turrets, air turrets, satellites and more.Multiplayer can be challenging and fun, however getting to that point is a whole new kind of headache. Naturally there are connection problems depending on the physical location of the person you're playing with, but just trying to CONNECT to that persons game can take nearly five minutes. And then sometimes you might get disconnected from that persons game.


You see a lot of this....

Not to mention you need to probably arrange a game with a friend, since there aren't enough people playing the game that you can just drop in and play with a random person.Achievements: Now we come to my biggest complaint about this game... the achievements are painfully tedious. There are 28 achievements in DETOUR. After beating the game for the first time I had literally 4 achievements.Most of the achievements in DETOUR are actually exclusively unlocked in multiplayer mode. And none of them are quick unlocks, you need to coordinate with 3 other people for some achievements, but a handful of achievements can be unlocked with just another person (1 vs 1 matches).Price: DETOUR is priced at $4.99, for an indie game that's a pretty fair price. I personally like to spend one hour in game for every dollar, that will easily show up on my game time, because... ...unfortunately connecting to a 4 player game requires about five minutes of restarting and reconnecting DETOUR.The single player campaign will take about an hour or two, depending on how good you are at strategy games.Conclusion: Story: irrelevant – I didn't feel like reading the day I did the campaign. A tiny note in my defense; a game should make you WANT to know more about the story, and this game failed in that aspect. Gameplay: the core mechanics were mostly solid, but there were graphical errors, and multiplayer connection problems. Achievements: Agonizingly long to work on these and un-soloable. Not an easy 100% completion game. Price: the price is a little high for how much time the average player will spend on the game.All in all, DETOUR has a number of flaws and I haven't particularly enjoyed playing it. That probably means most “normal” people won't like playing it. However if you're looking for a game to play with a friend, this will give you several hours of entertainment, and even more hours of connection problems.I recommend this game to Indie-Game Supporters, Strategy-game-fans, and achievers who aren't daunted by several hours of coordinating with others to obtain 100% completion.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 24, 2015:Formatting Updates/Adjustments			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												I loved the ""Simple Graphics"" option, considering this is a strategy game. I'm bothered that a lot of modern games of the genre can't run on cheaper laptops with common Intel HD chipsets. Besides one problem I encountered in the first minute the game. The game does not adjust the dpi with the resolution so the game is unreadable below 1024x768, the resolutions below 640x480 are so impractical it must be an Easter egg. Pacing can be a problem when explaining a strategy game but not here until the controls get in the way. Scrolling for items can be impossible on a laptop without a mouse around, (and even with one) nothing feels like cheating more than sluggish controls. It feels like a portable game for a certain fruit shaped company's tablet but the cross platform support isn't there so I doubt it because it uses DX9. I will check it out on max settings on my desktop in a bit and see what I'm missing from those shaders. I'm on the fence about the price but I would call it a buy, a bundle or sale preferably, and a 7.5/10. I almost want to play lowest resolution matches on Twitch. EDIT: The shaders help, 1080p helps. Upon playing to the first achievement I think 7.5/10 is fair. This Dev gives out free keys all the time and I really appreciate that. I plan to put a few hours on this before I consider uninstalling it. I have another game of there's I planned to review if I can remember what it is.			",225,47,9,21,11,2,25

												A good game with friends.Detour has a great idea around gameplay. Battling opponents to get trucks to the other side of the map. This involves bomb, missiles, and a bunch of other stuff. The game controls are slightly annoying, as switching from roads to tunnels to missiles takes WAY more effort that it could. The best way is to learn the hotkeys. The other downfall is not many people actually play the game at one time. So servers are limited. The best way to play is have some friends that wish to play as then you have someone to enjoy the game.So overall Detour is a great game to play... with some friends. Not by yourself.

												Detour is a race to the finish, strategy game where you play as a member of the Hard Head Construction Co, whose job it is to build a road from the player factory on the bottom end of the gameboard, all the way to the other end of the gameboard. This road can be constructed as a standard road, mountain tunnel, and bridge over water. Sounds simple enough; However there are multiple obstacles both environmental as well as Computer opponent created, which work against you. From Marshlands where protesters can be bribed to block, Boulders you need to destroy, Rivers to cross and mountains to tunnel through, Computer players destroying your roads and more, Detour offers an interesting challenge. Oh, did I forget? You also have tolet loose your fleet of factory trucks and get them to safety before your opponent, otherwise you are out of a job. Detours might seem easy and simplistic, but as you progress it becomes more challenging, with a computer AI that knows right where to hurt you. Detour offers you the chance to play through 9 tutorial missions, with progressive difficulty, teaching you how to navigate various obstacles and use various tools such as road nails, dynamite, and truck speed upgrades to your advantage. All in all, even though the game comes off as simple, it grows on you and can be challenging the further you progress. Pick it up, give it a try.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

			My review of ""Detour"", a multiplayer-focused puzzle game developed and published by Sandswept Studios. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming Follow...		

Game: DetourGenre: Construction MultiplayerDeveloper: Sandswept Studios Publisher: Sandswept Studios Copy supplied by developerDetour is a multiplayer-focused construction game developed and published by Sandswept Studios. This is going to be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written and recorded, since the game is pretty simple to describe.GRAPHICSReally poor graphics: absence of many animations, boring background, poor particle effects and GAMEPLAYYour goal is to build a road that goes from one point of the map to the other so that your trucks can travel there, while also trying to destroy the roads built by your adversary. The end. There are multiple objects that you could use, but it pretty much becomes a game of ""the one who builds the road first wins"", while in the singleplayer challenges you will have little to no problems since the AI is braindead and predictable.CHALLENGEAs I've already said, beating the AI is really easy, while in multiplayer you will spend more time using dynamite and hoping that your enemy doesn't notice you rather than using any real tactic.SOUNDThere aren't many sound effects, and the ones that are there aren't all that polished. The soundtrack is really uninteresting and annoying when playing, and you will find yourself muting it to preserve your sanity.REPLAYABILITY28 Steam achievements and multiplayer mode will make you come back if you were enjoying the experience. Singleplayer challenges will be beaten pretty easily, but you can try beating your highscores.Overall, Detour is not a game for everybody: it is very easy when playing solo, and it lacks strategy in multiplayer. I recommend buying it only when on sale, since its price drops a lot. Otherwise, don't buy it.Story: n/aGraphics: 4Gameplay: 5.5Challenge: 3.5Sound: 4.5Replayability: 7ENJOYMENT: 5FRUSTRATION: 2Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group ",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												This game is similar to the connect the pipes doohickey. You go head to head with other factory owning NPC in building a route for transport across the map. You can build the road straight through and over obstacles or zigzag around them.The gameplay is straightforward - using any means necessary, build a route and get your cargo truck to the other side before your opponents do so.PS. NPC's AI will get really childish later in the game, making it even more awful than it is. ",131,18,4,16,19,0,21

This little bugger is addictive as hell :-) Easy game mechanics but with quite a lot of options later on, frenetic clicking and all is over in few minutes so it doesn't hold you for long.

												I purchased this game for me and my friends, it cost 2.79p and I wish I hadn't spent it. I purchased it ages ago, fooled by the trailer. Me & My friends have powerful computers and I was disappointed when the frame rate was incredibly low. I asked my friends and they all said it was low too. I then still played it and it was boring, after a game, I got too bored and quit. I don't recommend it unless you like this kind of stuff.			",33,10,0,2,11,0,5

												★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆ 5/10 ..Meh.. I'll recommend this game since theres no neutral recommendations, simply because it does have card drops and you can find it dirt cheap in bundles and what not and it runs fine with some minor AI bugs and quirks. It's also very easy to understand and play, it's just very simple and you can count that as a good thing or a bad thing, The other piece I'm not a big fan of is for some reason instead of trying to out-do you the AI tries to just focus on attacking you and your projects rather then trying to win himself. I think it's just simply poorly written AI but maybe it is programmed to work that way. All in all, it's an okay game to get in a bundle which I did and it's not fantastic by any means but it's also not terrible. The mixed reviews serve it well I believe it needs some polish.

												Sabotage your opponents while trying to build a road for your truck to reach the goal line.It's an easy to understand game with a multiplayer focused game.It's single player is not as challenging as playing against other people.The IA needs more tweaks, it just do the same thigns all the time and you can more likely lock it doing the same while building your road.You need to manage your cooldowns and think fast, its a good game.I recommend you play with friends and discovery the good things about this game with them.

Review - DETOUR""I never knew road-building would be this challenging!""DETOUR is an RTS game where your main goal is to build a road such that you'll be able to send enough trucks to the other side of the map but there's a catch, you're not the only one aiming for that goal. The player will be playing against AI players and yeah, they'll do anything to stop each other from reaching the other side of the map whether they need to use dynamites, bombs or even those EMP missiles. DETOUR is a very challenging game since building a road to the other side won't be a stroll around the park. Though you'll all have the same upgrades but still, it'll require strategic planning and timing especially that resources are very scarce when all hell has broken loose. There will be times that you'll need to be cunning like having a decoy road while making a secret route or go for a straight-forward approach, and immediately aim for the other side or you could even go for a destructive approach where you'll save up your resources and wait for your opponents to finish making their roads and then destroy them to smithereens while stacking your road for the win. It's a strategy of your choice.I recommend this game for those who are looking for a cheap yet challenging game. The graphics and sound effects are simple but the gameplay itself can gob about 2-3 hours of your time. The game also features multiplayer mode. And just a little advice for new players, if you're playing with your friends on multiplayer mode, the large bomb weapon can end a lot of friendships.My Personal Rating:Graphics: 6/10Music: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Overall: 7.0			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

												Very likely the best game I have ever played on Steam (and the price of which I can only describe as an Ocean Elevening).- very deep strategical play, with up to three other players. You think StarCraft II had deep strategical elements? Get ready to take a DETOUR into a WHOLE NEW WORLD OF TACTICS!- unlimited replayability, as last I checked I had logged up well over AN HOUR of gameplay. Call of Duty hardly gives you that now-a-days, yet the value for this game is nuts!- too-good-too-be-true graphics: you think the CryENGINE looked good? Imagine as if your monitor has no panel and you're looking directly through at a highway. WELCOME TO DETOUR! IT IS NO FANTASY!A++ would play forever and ever. If you don't own, it is a MUST BUY, unless you hate video games in which case don't buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this for 15p on deal.Fun enough stradegy game which actually places importance on time and is good for the price.  However the game can quite easily get boring and unless your playing with freinds the multiplayer is sparse.If this Game is at full price I would NOT reccomend purchasing this game as there are much beter games out there for the price. However if the game is on deal it's worth it as if you have nothing to do it will give an easy 1-2 hours of entertainment but not really I game I would return to after playing more than the first or second set of missions.To add to the plus sides this game has steam trading cards of which you get 3/5 making this an easy badge to obtain at the normal card prices of £0.07			",112,7,0,11,6,0,4

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Detour with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.Detour is a puzzle game which tasks you with creating a safe route for a truck to pass through a hostile city.Now the bad part. This game runs atrociously. The first thing that struck me when starting up the game for the first time is the inexcusable amount of latency when using the software cursor. The delay between my mouse movement and the cursors response on the screen varied anywhere from 0.5 to (not exaggerating) 2.5 seconds! If you’re really desperate to play Detour, your first priority should be to enable Hardware Cursor in the options menu. Following the debacle with the laggy mouse, I noticed there were a fair few grammatical issues with the level selection text. Typically with low budget/hobby games I sort of just overlook this, especially when the narrative is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant to the actual gameplay. Unfortunately, after seeing the issues with the cursor, these errors were much more eye catching and set a precedent in my mind that this was either shoddily put together or unnecessarily rushed to release. Then I began the campaign. I actually quit midway through the first level just to activate Steams’ FPS counter and boot up Fraps to confirm my suspicions: this isometric mobile-port style puzzle game was running at 16 FPS on a GTX 680 and an overclocked i7-2600k. I suffered on through a handful more levels just to know what the game was trying to be, and as intriguing as the concept may be, the performance of this game is just abysmal.

												Detour is an odd game. First off, it’s based around multiplayer, but unless you have played through the first couple of single player missions, you have no idea what’s going on. Another thing I noticed right off was the framerate. On a computer with a Core i5 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and a GPU with 2 GB of RAM of its own, I was getting 16 frames per second. On a computer that’s about 4 times the system requirements! However, once the game started, it didn’t disappoint. While the graphics aren’t the best, especially running at 16 frames per second on the lowest settings, the gameplay was fantastic. The goal of the game is to get a certain number of trucks from your factory to the other side of the map using roads and tunnels. However, your opponent can try to stop you through many methods. One of these is by bribing the police to stop your trucks. After getting sufficiently angry, retaliation can be had by bombing your fellow opponent off of the face of the earth. Mad at the fog of war? No problem! Just run a scan! Don’t want to be scanned? Jam the signal! Don’t want your opponents getting across wetlands? Just fund the local conservation foundation! The fun in this game truly lies in the simplicity of the gameplay, but the complexity the game can take on when played by two skilled players.After all this, I give this game a thumbs up. It may not be the most visually appealing, but it’s all it set out to be: a good RTS based around semi trucks. I never thought I’d ever type that last sentence, but there it is. Anything can happen.			",415,113,12,72,49,9,60

The mechanic is straightforward, but with the awkward UI the rush of ""gotta get there before the other guy"" isn't as much fun as stressful.It's an intriguing concept - competitive/multiplayer simpler City Skylines - but the execution didn't go nearly far enough for me to find it fun.Ah, and fair warning - I'm reviewing this b/c it was given to me for freezies.

Another thing I noticed right off was the framerate. On a computer with a Core i5 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and a GPU with 2 GB of RAM of its own, I was getting 16 frames per second. On a computer that’s about 4 times the system requirements! However, once the game started, it didn’t disappoint. While the graphics aren’t the best, especially running at 16 frames per second on the lowest settings, the gameplay was fantastic. The goal of the game is to get a certain number of trucks from your factory to the other side of the map using roads and tunnels. However, your opponent can try to stop you through many methods. One of these is by bribing the police to stop your trucks. After getting sufficiently angry, retaliation can be had by bombing your fellow opponent off of the face of the earth. Mad at the fog of war? No problem! Just run a scan! Don’t want to be scanned? Jam the signal! Don’t want your opponents getting across wetlands? Just fund the local conservation foundation! The fun in this game truly lies in the simplicity of the gameplay, but the complexity the game can take on when played by two skilled players.After all this, I give this game a thumbs up. It may not be the most visually appealing, but it’s all it set out to be: a good RTS based around semi trucks. I never thought I’d ever type that last sentence, but there it is. Anything can happen.			",415,113,12,72,49,9,60

The mechanic is straightforward, but with the awkward UI the rush of ""gotta get there before the other guy"" isn't as much fun as stressful.It's an intriguing concept - competitive/multiplayer simpler City Skylines - but the execution didn't go nearly far enough for me to find it fun.Ah, and fair warning - I'm reviewing this b/c it was given to me for freezies.

												Detour is a furious, quick-map RTS that focuses on a much-lamented element of gaming:  The ESCORT mission!  You must safely guide a convoy of trucks from one edge of a map to another.  When delaying (and sometimes deadly) obstacles stand in your way, you must figure out how to dispatch them fast...even if this means trailblazing your way through.  Your opponent is busy doing the same, so learning to spy on their activity is just as important as developing your offense.  Four years on, the game's new pricetag is more than reasonable.

												This is a competitive truck delivery game.All you have to do is make sure your truck drives safely to the other side.Too bad the opponent haves to do the same.Both sides count on several methods to halt the opponents advance.This game is pretty simple in its premise, but in reality it's a fast paced truck and road destrucion war that depending on your opponent you might need fast reflexes and decision making to emerge victorious.This game is actually quite fun to play and it's kidna crazy too, considring your using bombs and turret to stop your opponent in just making his truck go to the other side.If you like fast paced games this is a nice game, especially on free-for-alls, 1 on 1 is pretty competitive, but free-for-all is just plain chaos.I recomend it.

												First of all thank you to Senpai Studios for the free key and asking me to review their game. I will put actual effort into this one especially since this is a type of game I usually would not play.Detour has from what I read had a lot of work done on it. It is an RTS a genre of game I am not very experienced in this genre.  However the main point of the game is to get your trucks to the goal buy building roads, tunnels and bridges when needed and sabotaging your enemy’s attempts to get their trucks to their goal.The game has single player challenges and online multiplayer I could not find anyone to play against online however. The Single player challenges do a good job at introducing the mechanics of the games. It starts off pretty easy and opens up the things such as using bridges over water and tunnels through mountains. Eventually you will get aggressive to the point where you can sabotage enemy roads with dynamite and nails to stop their trucks and even turrets to destroy enemy trucks.The difficulties for the challenge modes are set by difficulty grouped by nine from what I could tell. The story isn’t much you are just Mr. Creaseys’ new recruit. He shows you the ropes and tells you to go get ‘em and be the best road builder/bomber ever.Honestly I could very well recommend this game especially since so much was improved although I never played the original before the update it plays just fine. I liked the concept as well since as I live somewhere where road construction takes forever. I wish I could put roads down like this this quick in real life.So grab it and if you got friends you know would like it buy the four pack and start destroying each other! ",613,210,9,122,44,3,55

												Good concept riddled with transphobia, unpredictable A.I. behavior, and going from ""baby's first RTS"" to ""BRUTAL HARD"" mode with no in-between, nobody's playing it so no available multiplater and no generation for random vs A.I. battles (other than baby's first and brutal hard mode). Seriously, was naming the transgender character ""Tranny"" necissary?! Why is this allowed to be sold on steam?			",146,53,0,28,19,3,16

												Detour is a real-time strategy game where your goal is to get three trucks from your base to the opposite side of the map. Watch out for dynamite that destroys road, missiles that take out your trucks, and other hazards that others may send at you.It's kind of an interesting premise, that leads to some interesting, fast-paced gameplay. That said, when there were four players desparately fighting for the middle ground, it was incredibly hard to figure out what was going on at any given time. I'd be repairing roads in one part the map while the other half was getting shredded by the AI. Half the time, the bridges and tunnels didn't work as I expected, and I didn't realize my roads weren't connecting.Sadly, this ends up as an amateur attempt at a strategy game. There's a good idea here, but it's not well-designed, and as a result, really isn't all that fun and not terribly engaging for fans of strategy. It seems like it would be mildly entertaining as a dumb multiplayer game, since the frantic action could make some fun moments with friends, but I think that's about the only value you'll find here. If this looks interesting, check out Sid Meier's Railroads!, which is buggy and flawed but much more fun.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												The tutorial is nice and forgiving, but two levels later, it's impossible.A rubbish game that's horribly inbalanced and WAY too fast. No option of slowing down game play, or increasing/decreasing difficulty. As with many games the AI has the ability to utalize all functions at once, where a human can only select one.Not worth the time or resources, UNLESS you get a hacked client and force the AI to slow the ♥♥♥♥ down.

												If I were to say one thing I'd definitely remove the idea of chess from the description. A game of Detour can get quite frenetic. A word you can never use to describe chess. The way detour fully works only becomes apparent after you've played it for a bit. You have to get your trucks to the other side but also stop the other people getting theirs across using bombs, turrets etc. and it can end up getting quite frenetic and violent as you juggle the many balls you have in the air all at once. You will not have time to make considered moves, you will have to react and battle, and battle quickly to be the winner. It's very much a short form game.It feels a little iOS-y and the graphical and musical style is really not to my taste, but once you get under the hood, there's meat on the bones.

												This is a medium/lukewarm recommendation, based mainly on price.  Kind of an interesting little real-time board game style thing.  Seems easily breakable in multiplayer mode.  Strategy seems to basically be spam roads to connect resources and get to the other side.  Then launch trucks and bomb your opponents' roads, fixing your roads when necessary.  Simple, but fun, for a little while anyway.  For $0.19, definitely worth a buy and a few minutes of your time.  I would rate it as worth $1.00.  Not more than $2.00.			",227,68,1,67,50,4,124

												Well, Detour is an educational game I would say. Very good for children under the age of 10.The game is pretty much racing and resource management. You build roads to get your trucks to the finish line as fast as possible while trying to hinder the AI from doing the same. Its a decent strategy game and with multiplayer, you are able to really test your on the fly speed thinking.			",399,113,13,35,35,5,57

You are tasked to compete against other construction companies in order to get your truck to it's destination.It's a very simple mechanic, but people who enjoy these kinds of games, I'd recommend to. But for me, this game is alright.If you like fast paced strategy games, this game is for you.Everyone else, no recommendation.			",184,24,6,25,20,0,13

												This is a game that expands greatly in the amount of ways you can beat your opponent, and is a decent game to play if you just want to practice strategies for other games in general. This game tried to be a strategy game and succeeded greatly at doing it, but the thing is you can't really do much with the strategies and fields you are given. It ends up just being the fact of who has more income and who has faster trucks and just ends up with a stand still most often between opponents. The missions were somehwhat difficult at first, but then you begin to learn and notices strategies you can use every time in order to beat them. Overall it is a nice game to play a round of with friends just to try new things and challenge yourself, but the initial game itself doesn't hold much strategy to it from there.

												This is a masterpiece of the gaming community. After being on steam for nine years,  having 2 accounts, and sifting through the grim and dirt of the worst games possible like cs:go, The Witcher 3, Left 4 Dead 2, Rocket League to name a few of the worst games I found in my experience. DETOUR is the best action puzzle game I've played in a while, it combines the artistic style of modern life and the AAA gameplay of Clash of Clans. If someone held a gun to my child's head and told me to choose between them and my copy of DETOUR, I would gladly hand my child over so I could continue to play this magnum opus of gaming. all in all I give this game my seal of approval, support the developers, give away your childre, and lock down for a great time. I give DETOUR a sold 9.5/10 the most generous score I've ever given.			",11,0,0,0,1,0,0

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not the best of games, but it's really cheap when on sale.Get it on sale and it'll be a good laugh for an hour or so.I bought 4 copies, but nobody will ever accept the remaining 2 and the friend who did accept one never played it.Most people told me I should be ashamed for buying such a thing.They were right, but at least I supported the developers.Now the developers can almost afford a single cup of coffee.

												It looked cheesy at first, but it turned out to be really fun. The objective is simple, get your truck to the other side of the map. But somehow they found a way to make it interesting and addicting. You can set nails in opponents roads and bomb them, there are EMP attacks and a ton of other ways to thwart your competition. You learn to build quick and have to constantly prioritize you offense and defense. There is an online mode and a LAN party mode. I forgot how much, I paid but it was very little and definitely worth it. I will be playing it more in the future.			",46,0,0,1,1,0,0

												Im not a real big fan of RTS games to begin with, but this was....decent. The textures were ok, but the audio is horrendous. The mechanics are really cool, but underdeveloped. The multiplayer barely has 2 or three people, who never know how to change any game settings. The humor is cringe worthy. Fun for the first few rounds. Great for cards/badges. Beat the first five missions in five minutes. AI is almost broken. In general, just dont even bother. Maybe an update will change everthing.  Written 4/13/16			",43,8,0,5,3,1,1
