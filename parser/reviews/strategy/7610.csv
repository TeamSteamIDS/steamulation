												The system requirements of this game confuse me.  It says that it will not run on Windows Vista or Windows 7, but it's running fine for me on Windows 7 and I didn't have to do anything to make it work.  I simply installed it and it worked.  Now, to the game.  I really enjoyed playing Railroad Tycoon 3, being my first Railroad Tycoon game on PC (after having played Railroad Tycoon 2 on the PlayStation 2) and in my opinion, it is a much better and simpler game to play than its predecessors			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having spent a long time playing this as a kid it was nice to see RRT3 available on Steam. For me the game ran on Windows 7 without any problems whatsoever.While understandably the graphics feel slightly dated, the gameplay has really not aged at all. It does a superb job at modelling Railroad construction with plenty of Locomotives from the very begining, all the way up to the modern, high-perfomance machines.Apart from that it also has an excellent virtual economy where it really does pay to plan ahead. If you want to build cars for instance you need steel and tires. Steel gets produced seperately combining ore and coal, whereas the tires obviously need rubber. RRT3 is about as in depth as any mainstream tycoon gets, even compared to modern games. Sure if you like micro management you'll find games that will challenge you more, but a game thats over 10 years old, it easily pulls its weight. Its also a lot better than Sid Meiers Railroads.

												Railroad Tycoon 3 was my favorite game back when I was younger (Besides Battle for Bikini Bottom), but does it still hold up for 10 years? For themost part, yes!Railroad Tycoon 3's graphics where great in its day, the soundtrack is good to listen to and tons of interesting scenarios, and for the most part, historically correct! It has has an editor to create new maps, and a decent multiplayer. The champaign is interesting, and hundreds of locomotives and a selection of industries.However, the soundtrack is mostly bluegrass music and doesn't make sence (Example: There is a scenario based in Japan, and you hear Kentucky Bluegrass instrumentals). The graphics are a little dated and the AI is can be a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times no matter the difficulty.This game is like an old box of Twinkies, it's a bit aged and seen better days but the inside is great and filled with absoulute win. The game still hold up after 10 years and is still a good game that can hold my attention. I recommend getting this game. It serves as an awesome tycoon game, and is up there with The Movies and Game Dev Tycoon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah Railroad Tycoon 3, my childhood. Before I go any further, the game WILL work on Vista and Windows 7. Go to http://hawkdawg.com/ to find patches for blurry textures and the Vista fix.Railroad Tycoon 3 is the third installment of the Railroad Tycoon series. Developed by PopTop Software and The Gathering of Developers, Railroad Tycoon 3 introduces the 3D engine to the Railroad Tycoon series. Railroad Tycoon 3 has three main game modes. Campaign, Sandbox, and Scenarios. If you want to play a challenging campaign mode, you have it, or if you just want to go and lay some track, you can do that too. In campaign mode, there are three difficulties; Easy, Medium, and Hard. You can choose between 25 different games to choose from, and can go from left to right, or start at the hardest one. In scenario mode, you play against a computer player on a selected map, and race to be the highest company to win. In sandbox mode, you pick a map and time period, and then go have fun!If you feel like you want to develop for the game, you can create skins and maps too. Railroad Tycoon 3 introduces a new map editor, making it easy to create maps. Unfortunately, it has a few issues, but I will talk about those later. Inside the map editor, you can import grey-scaled maps defining the height of a map, and add trees, rivers, oceans, and many more!~Probably the best thing about this game is the community support. Railroad Tycoon 3 has a huge community, primarily the one at hawkdawg.com. There you can find unofficial patches, maps, trains, and other things to enhance your Railroad Tycoon 3 experience. Sign-up there today!Overall, Railroad Tycoon 3 is amazing. The game is far superior to it’s successor Sid Meier’s Railroads, and some may argue that it’s predecessor Railroad Tycoon II, is better. All three games can be purchased in the Railroad Tycoon bundle, which is an amazing price for what you get. If you wait for a Steam sale, you get an incredible deal. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply awesome.  I've been playing this since it was first released so many years ago.  If you can't get it to work on Windows 8, then do some Googling and figure it out.  I think I ended up replacing the .exe file with something from somewhere!  All available through my friend, Google.For running a business, buying/selling stocks, investing in industry (and then feeding that industry), and considering business aspects of bonds, debt/capital, upgrading locomotives, electrifying rail, and so many other things, this game captures it all very well.  I simply wish there was a bigger, newer version by the same developers.  All newer games just can't capture the business side (with ease of UI) in addition to the rail building side of this game.  The newer ""Railroads"" was good but not great like this game.  The expansive maps of this game take it to another level.  Having millions of dollars moving around the map by multiple players is incredible...and oh, yes, there is multiplayer.  Not supported any more but on my LAN, my kids are learning business decisions and rail management at an early age.  All with me pushing them from my PC.  What a joy!  Cheers...

												Don't get me wrong, I love this game. However this is another case of steam selling you something knowing full well it won't run ""out the box.""

												The game gets a thumbs up. Classic and tons of fun.Edit: It does seem to crash very frequently, however. I guess that's what you get with a game as old as this one.Cannot, however, give a thumbs up to Steam support on this one. As many others have said, you will most likely find that it crashes within seconds of launching the app. This is because of a default setting that conflicts with just about every modern video card. You won't be able to get into the settings menu to fix this, crashes too quckly. If you run into this problem, you will have to go to a third party site and download an updated config file, replace the original, and then the game will function. The file is safe, the people who created this have my gratitude, but customers SHOULD NOT have to be subjected to downloading a file from a third party site in order to use a product they've been charged for. Upon contacting Steam support, they offered no assistance with this matter. I asked for a refund, was denied (i was outside of the timeframe so that was expected), but I also received no attempt from support to get the game running. The last part should not have happened, no excuse for that. At that point, I finally went ahead and downloaded the file (I was not comfortable doing this). Glad to say it worked :)Steam continues to sell a game with a well documented issue that they're aware of. If you do purchase this game, be prepared to go through the process I've explained (check the guides section for this game), or to request a refund. Thank you to the community for helping resolve this issue for myself and many others, you shouldn't have had to do that. Hope this saves someone a headache.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Railroad Tycoon 3 is a management strategy and railroad building simulator. As an enterprising tycoon (yes, an ACTUAL tycoon) of the 19th century or 20th century, build a railroad empire across a multitude of landscape, laying or acquiring tracks and locomotives, ferrying people and cargo, investing in your (or your competitor's) stock and industries, while the cities around grow and more advanced steam, diesel and electrical engines are invented.Pros: As a train company, you have a large amount of decisions you can make, although the game has a fairly enough simplified interface to avoid over-complication. A variety of options are available for the tracks you lay, the stations you build, the train engines you purchase and the cargo you haul. As time goes by, new technology and world modernization adds additional options, anywhere from new bridge types to new engine technologies (coal, diesel, electrical). Cities and industries are dynamic and take shape based on how much your company help them: cities will grow as you ferry passengers, new industries are build as cities grow, new cargo are available for import or export as new industries are built. You also get to manage stocks, whether issuing or buying it back, buying competitor's stocks for hostile takeover, and even influence how much power the shareholders have over your decisions from your own stash of stocks you can buy from your hard-earned salary as president of the company. The game also offers a large list of geographical locations to base your games, and game types such as goal-achieving scenarios, randomized games or straight sandbox.Cons: The graphics are showing their age a lot. You have limited randomization options and the land masses are pregenerated. You are limited to a single, continuous or branching railroad, unable to plant additional stretches if it doesn't connect to your existing track. Depending on the difficulty, competing tycoons are both extremely aggressive and extremely dumb in their track laying strategy.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youEven today, Railroad Tycoon 3 remains fun and is still the best incarnation of its genre: neither too realistic nor too gamy/dumbed-down. If you like this sort of game and don't mind the aging look, you'll find plenty of options in this game, well worth the price!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												This game is excellent. I put off buying it for a long time due to the warning about compatibility but it runs just fine on my Windows7 laptop and I'm delighted as it's a chance to get back to tycooning those railroads. As I did so happily for countless hours a few years ago. There is something inherently satisfying about getting this game right and watching your trains speed around earning you money. The graphics are a little dated now but it's still decent looking and a joy to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been a fan ofthe Railroad Tycoon series since II, and when 3 came out the leap from the choppy 2D graphics to the smooth, living 3D graphics was pretty damn sweet!  As far as economic simulation games go, it really doesn't get any better than this and the game has aged remarkably well.  I've heard being say ""Aw, come on!  It's just connect City A to City B in not quite enough time to do it.  What's the fun?""  The fun is that, generally, they give you any number of ways to accomplish it.  Take Sid Meier's Railroads! by contrast.  They plop you into a city and say ""Have fun!""  RT3, again generally, gives you any number of ways to start and accomplish your goal.  A bunch of the stategery involved in a level is where and how to start out.  The campaign is challenging, the music is old school bluesy fun, the editor works great and there are awesome community-made maps out there.  When it jumps on sale, you should totally grab it!  One of my all-time favourites!  :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even for those with no special interest in trains (I wouldn't particularly quantify my own interest in trains as anything more than above average) RRT3 has an indepth economic model for fans of business sims in general, presented in an interesting way and with many challenging scenarios. Goal oriented gamers will enjoy the experience RRT3 has to offer, as will gamers that enjoy customization of options in the sandbox mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note before review: This game works well on Windows 7, both 64 and 32 bit setup.Railroad Tycoon 3 is one of my all time favourite games that I love to play. Managing your company to go against the competition, you work towards earning that extra $ to afford upgrades and much more. Buying the industries, you learn to add companies to use the resources. An example of this would be the logs --- add Lumber Mill, Furniture factory, Toy factory (it will tell you when wood is no longer accepted) and paper mill. Lay a track down next to these and add a station to start your freight trains to the cities to build up their reputation. The higher the star, the greater the demand making your company increase in profit and helping the cities. Add hotels, restaurants and pubs in the cities all help with your company getting the very best out of the game. Invest in other companies to eventually take over and add their lines to their your business. Start with single tracks, upgrade to double and then to electric...the game just keeps on going to eventually you become the main man or woman.Overall I love this game, its the best! I recommend having the industry map for this to help you, any one who wish to have a copy of this map is more than welcome msg me for a copy! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED game to every one on Steam...just excellent!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything from laying track, to creating train routes, to selling stocks, to merging and taking over other railroads!  Three game modes to choose from: Campaign, Scenario, and Sandbox (free play).  I personally love this game, and would recommend this to everyone!  (for how cheap it is, why not)[NOTE] Even though they say this game is not compatible with windows 7, I know for a fact (at least for me), that it works with both Windows 7 and 8... so don't let that stop you from purchasing this great game!

												Best railroad tycoon you can get. I got it when it first came out and just got it on steam because my old version doesn't want to work any more.Pros: Great music, beautiful landscapes, and lots of trains. It's even better with the extension and when you mod it adding even more trains and cars. Cons: you do have to get a file to make it work with newer computers. Also you will grow old and grey playing it and one day ask yourself... where did I get this conductors hat?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still the wonderful game I remember. Two things:First, you can totally repurpose keys, which is lucky for a game this old. I highly recommend changing the scrolling and pause to WSAD and spacebar.Second, in order to get it running on Windows 10, I followed the instructions and the download called ""Vista/Win 7/Win 8 Fix"" at http://hawkdawg.com/rrt/rrt3/Xtras/ . I've also found that I have to alt+tab out and back in once the main game is loaded in order for the screen to display properly. It's a minor annoyance, but not a huge deal, and worth it.

												Railroad Tycoon 3 was released in 2003 it got a fresh 3D makeover over its 2D predecessor, Railroad Tycoon 2. It played well at the time but today it's another matter. If you decide to buy the game be advised that it most probably won't work ""out of the box"" and you'll need to go through support pages to find a fix to make the game work. The complexity of the process depends on your machine, its configuration and OS. As for the game, I liked the 3D back in the day as it was a nice novelty but I found myself getting back to Railroad Tycoon 2 quick enough. There are many bugs and players new to the genre will find it a bit hard to keep their companie's heads out of the water financially. As they say, if you want to run a train play Railroad Tycoon 3 and if you want to run a train company, play Railroad Tycoon 2. As for me, there's not enough in this game, now or back in the days, to warrant a purchase. If all you want to do is play with trains without too much hassle, financial or otherwise, you might want to play Railroads!, by the genre's creator Sid Meier.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yet another awesome game I played in my childhood, saved by Steam! I always dreamed of building my own railroad and purchasing my own trains to operate on them! And this is great! I really love the intro, the graphics, the train models, and some of the sound effects, too! Though I still wish I could add helper engines or back engines to my trains, I still have a lot of fun with this game and it's still close enough to my dream. But this game used GameSpy for multiplayer and GameSpy is defunct now, so I can't play on multiplayer mode. I never even knew Railroad Tycoon 3 had multiplayer, when i was little, so I never even got to try it. I think Steam should give this game an edition of their own and give it they're own source for multiplayer, like they did with Microsoft Flight Simulator X. But I still have just as much fun with it as I did, when i was little, and this is definitely one of the best train games on Steam, in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Firstly, I would like to say that I read the ""warning"" and bought the game anyway.  To my surprise and delight, the game runs fine on my Windows 7, 64bit OS.RRT3 is a true classic.  (Don't look at my Steam hours -- I was playing this game long before Steam existed!  I spent hundreds and hundreds of houres of my youth playing the RRT series).The game is very challenging and interesting to play; it's addictiveness rivals Civ's with ""one-more-scenario"" compulsions.  Essentially an RTS, you build rail lines and manage trains to deliver cargo over the map.  These range from tiny locales (the state of New York in the early eras), to entire continents later in the game.  A huge variety of locomotives is available, each with their strengths and weaknesses.  Building lines carefully is also extremely important -- grade (slope angle) directly affects your trains' speed, hauling power, and therefore profit.RRT3 adds a lot more streamlining to the cargo consist options, allowing you to pick up specific cargoes or simply ""freight"", ""passengers & mail"", or ""all"", making it easy for your railroad to adapt over time.  This incarnation also introduced the idea of ""other"" transportation to the map -- where rivers and short land spans will be traversed by the computer (vis barges & wagon trains) to reach your stations.  For example -- if you notice a lot of sheep farms along a river, you can build a textile mill downstream and the wool will be delivered there over time, even if you don't have a rail connection.This economic realism also makes the game significantly more challenging as supply and demand severely affects delivery prices, making you constantly want to search for more profitable routes.Like the other games in the RRT series, you can also play the stock market, buy industry, and sell/start new companies.My favorite sound in gaming comes from this very game... when you have a thriving railroad, the ""ding ding ding"" of all those trains rolling into their stations making money is music to my ears!

I tend to run this one on a Virtual Machine that is running Windows XP.   This one is more involved as you have to place watering stations, sanding stations, repair depots, and you can own just about every type of factory, farm, etc. in this game.   You can make a lot of money just by owning industries.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like tycoon games or railroad games this is probaly the best one ever made handdowns. It might be a little old and alot of people have problems getting it to work but the fixes are very easy to find and make.  Building your own railroad buying industries,  buying stocks and merging with other companyies is what makes this game so good.  Some of the campains are very chalenging but thats what makes it addictive to play.  Fail once try a different route or strategy.  Some mods are avaiable but are very hard to get ahold of.  Until a new dev can actually out do this game i wont play any other tycoon maybe besides rollercoaster tycoon(the very first one). I also own sid meyers railroads which is fun but not compared to this. Its smaller maps and none of the steamers have a tender(kinda a important part).  But like i said if you like or want a railroad or tycoon style game dont pass this one up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The classic series that sparked the Tycoon franchise. RT3 is the ultimate conlusion of this and is a faithful and detailed simulation. Difficult to get started with ilimited funds and routes on most maps but all the mroe rewarding for it. The chingchingching of money coming in and the relaxing tempo and scenary of the game make it a pleasant experience all round, classic gamers must add this to their collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RRT3 is a real game, designed by a real, legendary game company from the golden age of gaming that has now passed. It can suck you in and get you interested. Its fun and amazing even though the graphics look bad compared to everything today. It also needs to be fixed to play it on Vista but its not that hard to fix it. So far it is the only bright spot in five other games I bought on the Christmas sale. 9/10 and a must buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Solid railroad tycoon game, but the learning curve seems very steep. I beat a few of the scenarios and enjoyed them for the most part, but the amount of micro management seemed a bit overwhelming and even daunting at times. Almost like I had to learn an entirely new language just to get good at the game. The soundtrack is pretty nice and the grapics are okay, though nothing to write home about. One of the really big features of the game is the map editor; you can customize and create your own landscape, cities and railways and then use that map in a campaign. I'm sure that for someone with a passion for trains and some time, this would be an amazing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The original Railroad Tycoon gave my childhood hours of fun, and Railroad Tycoon 2 expanded upon it with better graphics... and Railroad Tycoon 3 does it yet again. If you enjoy semi-simulation games? You'll enjoy Railroad Tycoon 3. Strategizing where to place your stations, what type of cargo to carry and where and the routes plus switching station locations? Makes a pretty damn fun game. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay was not intuitive but it was also hard to see where I was failing or even if I was. I pressed the uninstall button almost immediately. Still playing RRT2 to this day.

												After playing Railroad Tycoon 2 for many, many hours, I thought I would give this title a try (it's fans love the game)...Pros: Improved EconomyMore clear train maintenanceCons:Dated 3D EngineEnvironment LightingVery weak interfaceUnaddressed Bugs (big con)My recommendation:If you can get past the fact that this game is run by an early 3D engine, and like management tycoon games, you might enjoy this game (I do). But if you are looking for something that might appeal more to your eyes, stick with Railroad Tycoon 2. It is almost exactly the same except for the few improvements *** I used Windows 7, there is a fix that changes files in the Configuration folder. Basically the game crashes at startup due to the initial splash screens/videos changing the resolution.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought Railroad Tycoon 2 Platinum a while ago and enjoyed playing it on and off.  The mechanics were good enough to keep me interested for a few hours, but the poor map generation (like having every city have a steel mill but putting no coal or iron ore on the map) was frustrating.  Still the ability to control the loading and unloading of goods manually was fun.Then I saw Railroad Tycoon 3 on sale and picked it up thinking that the inprovements in a newer edition would make the base game more enjoyable.  Wrong!  Essentially 3 removed all the fun aspects of 2 and added nicer graphics.In 2 you could set up to play a 25 year game with beating the other tycoons your only challenge.  Start your rail line anywere on the map and take off.  In 3 you have to choose a scenario and each scenario has specific goals that must be met, pretty stupid goals like connect city A to city B when both those cities have no goods to transport.Also, 3 did not fix the map generation issue and  worse, removed your ability to control the loading and unloading of your goods.  For example, in 2 you can specify that goods of a type be unloaded at a station for pickup by a different train which can then take them to the station that needs them.  In 3 you can not do this.2 is not a great game, but compared to 3 it's a gem.  If you must buy one of these then pick 2 and avoid 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Be careful if you have windows 8, because it might break your web browser. I loved this game as a kid, and had it on a disk so when I saw it on steam I wanted to relive those good memories. However After trying to play it it always crashes if you hit a button during the intro cinematic, and it sometimes crashes on its own. One time when it crashed I had google chrome open and when it crashed chrome crashed too, and now my chrome is broken, and nothing I've doen has restored it. I now have to use Firefox. If you don't want to use crappy browsers then be careful when buying this game. Also to meet the 5 min requirement  to write this review, I had to repeat the crashing intro over several times. It sucked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased RRT3 about 10 months ago.  It doesn't work on my Windows 8 system and neither Steam nor the manufacturer are able to get it to work.  Worse yet, they keep pointing fingers at each other as to a reimbursement.  I cannot get either Steam nor the manufacturer to fix the game (which has NEVER played); give me a credit and take it back or reimbursement the purchase price.  I am so angry with the lack of help that I am contacting the FTC on both Steam and the manufacturer for a claim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrible ♥♥♥♥ing game. Really fun if you can get it to work and thats a really big ♥♥♥♥ing if. There are a large amount of games on steam that say ""This game is not compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7"" but most of them actually work. This ♥♥♥♥ing game wont work at all and there's no longer any ♥♥♥♥ing support what so ♥♥♥♥ing ever. Steam doesn't support it 2k doesn't support it and even ♥♥♥♥ing Poptop doesn't support it anymore even though it's one of the few games they have on steam and is the highest rated but nope they've given the middle finger to us  and said ♥♥♥♥ off. If you can get it to run it's a good tycoon game. One from before all the tycoon games comming out became♥♥♥♥♥♥ So if you get it working great game if you can't you'll just feel like you got scammed. Steam needs to ether put a warning on this ♥♥♥♥ing game., delete it out right or ♥♥♥♥ing fix it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best economic/business simulators on Steam. The amount of fun building your railroad empire from scratch is innumerable due to no two playthroughs being the same. The game forces you to think about the economic consquences of every decision you make. The game does have what I like to call ""dice roll"" events through newspaper headlines. These are minor events like a new company being formed to compete with you, to major events like the economy crashing or natural disasters striking critical cities. Don't forget to keep an eye on your company! Keep your investors happy, and you'll receive more cash to spend. Make them mad, and they cut your salary. Anger them enough, and they'll fire you, forcing you to form a new company or restart. Watch your stock! Forgetting to buy stock in your company leaves the door open for others to chip away at your ownership of your company. Lose enough control, and you'll you have to fight off a merger. Fail that, game over. By far one of the more addictng games on Steam, trust me, the hours will roll on by as you play this...yes that was a bad pun and no, I won't apolagize.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Im lost for words, its rt3 not rt2, so why does it seem like its a step backwards when it was a fresh model under a different game engine model for track lay?FYI before spooting out complete nonsense, site your sourse for the dispute, all of the negative are very pointless...ooo im not a fan of ""Tycoon"" and it was boring... ofcourse its boring if not a fan of it, just like im not a fan of COD yet do not spoot on about i do not like it on your reviews, so why make a pointless review?In regards to RT3, it was a dated engine yet its from 2003, what were you expecting? Its funtional, does not crash, whatever bug that is being showcased as a con is very misleading...and furthermore, its more of a Tycoon then a Train simulator, balance the books, invest in stocks in a simulated Closed sector that is relevant to buying out competition, repairing, micro-managing fleets of cars per train, adventing thru the timeline of the history of different generations and different demographic from European, to North American styles, Alas would like it to have a mod functionality like OpenTTD, yet thats another whole type of tycoon in itself.Sorry for the Ramble, yet from the first time i played Rt1/2 it was familiar, then i got into 3 and was astonded with everything that was simular, yet moderate improvements of revising it with an antiquated 3D game engine.If had a choice of Rt3 or Railroads by 2KGames, id go with Rct3. Not to say its Ok, yet it just seems like a big mess with little replayability...Run Baron dificulty, and Learn, to block opponents rail-lines as a PRE-Set location...Unlike RT series, have a choice to fund a company, and start anywhere that was available...Still waiting for an updated modernized Tycoon that is in the works.Btw, try to Minic the Oriental Express that crossed between the warring territories along the alps, or Make a Contential East-West connection from Cali-Florida... so challenging, yet so rewarding to learn and understand the Do's and Dont'sThis is what makes a Tycoon game fun for the fans, know its not just the completion, yet the road to get there.If diesel smoke taught me anything, expect the unexpected and put back-up manuvers in perspective if undesirable events occur, same holds true when commonity prices fall due to rng tests how well can bounce back			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is intensely frustrating... because it appears to be the ultimatum of the transport tycoon simulation genre. After so long, nothing has quite managed to top it, and nothing has quite managed to produce the same depth and detail while not skimping on the railway-centric aspects.It's atmospheric, fairly pretty but most of all provides complex gameplay with a certain amount of depth. It really is astounding that nothing has managed to hit this balance so nicely since then, and it makes the fact I have to turn here rather infuriating. Great selection of locomotives - albeit not the most detailed - and a great selection of activities available; not to mention a fine amount of scenario tools to help get the most from the game's vast scope. I thought this looked astounding when it was first released, and while it's definitely not aged seamlessly, it still holds up well enough to make for a very pleasant experience. RRT3 is a masterpiece, but by God, I wish somebody would come by and do it better already. For the price you simply cannot and will not go wrong. Incidentally, it works fine on Windows 7, too.

After trying some suggested fixes, I was able to get through the introductory video but then the program would terminate. I heartily recommend the game if you enjoy either railroad or business oriented sims; smooth and challenging game play, good music and graphics that remain quite acceptable with the huge caveat that if you have the wrong rig/OS, you may end up on the outside not looking in.

												This was my favorite game when it came out in 2004, and I was happy when steam made it available for purchase. However, getting the steam version to work on any Windows OS after XP requires downloading two seperate patches from a third party fansite. The first disables hardware T&L which allows the game to run without CTD. The second enables high-res textures, because for some reason the textures are locked at their lowest setting regardless of what you do in the graphics menu.Once you get it working the game is great. Think of it more as an economics simulator with trains rather than a train simulator with economics. You can complete scanarios without buying a single locomotive if your shrewd enough. Play the campaign or a single scenario. Once you've played through completely you can download the unofficial 1.06 patch which adds new content and completely revamps the economic engine.

												Game runs fine on Windows 8.1. If the graphics look bad on your computer there's a fix for that too. I'm so happy I've finally gotten a chance to own my favorite game of all time again, especially after the disc died for my original copy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was an excellent purchase for me until I upgraded to a new computer running Windows 8. Now it will not run. At first all I got was a ""Could Not Find Steam"" message. After trying some suggested fixes, I was able to get through the introductory video but then the program would terminate. I heartily recommend the game if you enjoy either railroad or business oriented sims; smooth and challenging game play, good music and graphics that remain quite acceptable with the huge caveat that if you have the wrong rig/OS, you may end up on the outside not looking in.

												A True classic in the tycoon world. (Along with RR Tycoon 2). The thing i like about this game is that no two maps spawn the same. (Ex: I can start the british Isles map once and London may have a Steel mill and a meat packing plant. Wuit then start a new game now it has a Paper mill and farms.) Along with that there are a MULTITUDE of Locomotives. The A.I. for lacking of a better word is well out-dated but on Hard and even Normal it can provide an excellant run for your money. Especially when they decide WELL we want to link our tracks with your tracks and start stealing away your business but also bringing new business. A fun thing I like to do is wait for all the competitions trains to be on my rails and just cut em off. (Do Beware they may start running trains on your rails between your stations exclusively and although you get a % of their Profit it is only a % not full value from your trains.) Now I do have Windows 8 and it runs good after a Youtube video which gave me the correct configuration files. The Link to this fix i will provide.

												I like the game and the environment, the interface is clunky and dated, but once you get a feel for it, it is fun.  At first, I did not like the restrictive nature of the built in scenarios and campaigns, but once I found the Editor, I could turn off the time crunch objectives and turn this one into a real winner.  A real must have for fans of train games and even strategy games in general.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is AMAZING if you are into trains or railroad simulators. It is an absolute timesink. Often you'll find yourself finishing entire campaigns in one sitting - that's 1.5 hours apiece! The copy I owned before I got this Steam version must have had hundreds of hours on it. The graphics looks like♥♥♥♥♥ but hear me out! The mechanics are much more in depth and interesting than it's spiritual successor: Sid Meier's Railroads. This game is a true simulator, and the gameplay flows much smoother than RRT2 in my opinion (of course, that game has its own appeal). Honestly, I would pay a lot of money for a true Railroad Tycoon sequel.So if you think your ""blood is of the railroad"" then definitely play this game. I nominated this game for the ""Just 5 more minutes"" award, because in addition to the campaign missions, there are many more fan maps that you can download. Such an addicting game.

												Fantastic game which I think aged incredibly well. I still get a kick at admiring the different landscapes offered by the missions and seeing the map evolve as the activity booms with my rail expansion.Besides transporting passengers and mail, the game mostly centers around managing production chains, which can get quite complex for high end products such as car production. You can either just concentrate on your rail network to optimize the movement of goods or you can in addition to that task buy/build industries to have an even deeper impact on the economy (industry profits is where the easy money is made).Modern systems can't launch the game until you check a graphics setting (""Disable Hardware T&L"")... So you'll need to download a modified engine.cfg file and paste it into your Data/Configuration  RT3 folder to fix this called ""Vista/Win 7/Win 8 Fix"" : http://hawkdawg.com/rrt/rrt3/Xtras/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My steam time doesn't properly represent how many thousands of hours I have enjoyed with this game. I remember playing this as far back as when I was six and how much fun I had with it even before I could read properly. I'm 17 now and every time I look at this game in my library I brings back great memories and the fun times I had with this masterpiece and as obsolete as this game is I simply cant give it a down vote. I cant even play it anymore since it doesn't operate on windows 8 which is unfortunate because in my opinion it is still the best train management game in existence. If you live in the stone ages and still have windows xp of vista then get this game, it won't disappoint. but if you don't and are not tek-savoy then don't get this game or it will frustrate you for many hours in you futile attempt to get it working againI love this game probably more then anything else in my library and it saddens me that I can no longer play it because it was a great game.

												I think after winning gold medal in campaign mode and a few missions (scenarios) it's time to write a review to this nostalgic and still good game.This game is totally worth ever cent you pay, it's after all those years still a awsome game for everyone who likes the genres ''Tycoon'' & ''Trains''.So let's hop right into the Pro/Con section of this review:(First up there will be no focus on the graphics, due to this game is over 13 yrs. old)Pros:- very captivating- better economics than before - easy to understand- nice scenarios- sanbox-mode- editor-mode- low price for much funCons:- some maps are too small- not enough scenarios- bad rail-placement (sometimes, but it's annoying)- stupid KI on easy and mediumConclusion:This game is a whole lot of fun if graphics don't matter. Even after playing it for hours it's still great, of course there are some annoying things too, but well this game is a classic and nothing is free of errors. For fans of the series or the genre it's defenitley worth the money. Note: If it doesn't work on your PC simply follow the steps mentioned in the community posts, it always fixes the problem.I hope this review helped you, sorry for my english, I'm from Germany/Poland so this is the reason that I may have made a few mistakes. But anyways I think everyone should be able to read this and maybe it helps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no idea how many hours of my life have been spent playing this game, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask. Each game is different and there's no one real answer to complete every mission or scenario. I only wish there were more scenarios because after a decade of playing, they start getting a little old. Doesn't stop me from playing another game every once in a while though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to the broken mess that was no.2 in this franchise, this game is a lotmore balanced.  Perhaps a little too well.  So its really easy to play this game compared to past games, you can lin town to town and haul goods that way with little consquenes from the word get go.  masterful players will take working things better.The game also likes to push mail and passengers... Don't fall for it.  Their not as profitable a they seem until a town/city reahes a certain size. Some goods are far more profitable.  Overall, this is the better of the two games and I reommend it over no.2.... And I like it.  I can't really say much else of the game.  If you liked transport tycoon, this is the best of that game... Just limited to railroads.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing this for a while and I am very amazed at the amount of thought put into this game in the financial department.Other than just being a great Railroad Tycoon game, this game has a lot to do with Stocks and Bonds (finance things). So other than just building your Railroad empire and sitting around, there is a lot of things to do with the stock market including buying various stocks from other companies and dealing with your own stocks as well. Definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking forward to a soild Railroad Tycoon game that was a well built finance sim in it too. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
