												As far as RTS's go, I dont like them. Too many of them do their systems too incorrectly, or just dont plain make any logical sense, or reason. Dawn of War (all the expansion packs, consider this a recommendation for Dawn of War + all of the expansions), does some critical things right, which makes it stand out from the crowd. First, it actually focuses on strategy for the most part. Instead of spamming 1000 tanks at your enemy (im looking at you Ruse), you actually have chose a limited number of units to bring into battle. Meaning, every man, tank, and resourse is valuble, and losing any of the above can cost you the battle. This tension, and balencing on the brink of death keeps tension high, as players must constantly have to outdo their opponent on a mental capacity, not necessarily on a quanitative capacity. This conbined with some rather unique in game mechanics, such as morale, means interesting strategies can arise, when those similar would fall flat in other RTS's.And secondly, the game is able to keep a consistent feeling, tone, and atmosphere. Even for a strategy game, this is important, nothing takes you out of a game more than an interface, so even immersing the mission select screen in 40k does its job. Everything is plastered with 40k jargon and logic, a dark universe of war, death, and betrayal. As well, the game itself feels fitting, with you not taking resources, just getting requisition points to send in more troops, as you are successful in conquest, just as an example of many different things the game does right.The game is fitting, and is able to keep a consistent feel to gameplay and atmosphere. For this, I must heartily recommend Dawn of War to RTS fans, you will not be let down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wont discuss the mechanics or the diversity.  Look to the other comments for that♥♥♥♥♥♥  I am simply giving a story and some true as Khorne is bloodthirsty observations.  As I begin remember that in the future, there is only war.  One must choose his battlecry well.  For the Greater Good.One of the best RTS games out there.  Nothing quite beats some of the moments the game brings on.  The following is a part of a game I did (in skirmish) against the ai with 6 bots vs just my ai partner and I:As I looked at my minimap, I realized my buddy's base was quickly getting overwhelmed.  His outer defenses were obliterated not a few minutes ago, and yet the enemy was closing in around his HQ.  He was building guardsmen as quickly as he could but the onslaught of orks, chaos space marines, and necrons were too much.  His commander made a valiant last stand, but it was in vain...I was then alone.I scrutinized my defenses and realized I was lacking.  I quickly built many turrets as my first line of defense with some space marines around a pass that funneled the enemy forces down and caused them to lose some of the advantage of numbers.  My second line were multiple heavy tanks with melee infantry further behind the pass.  The purpose of this line was a bullet magnet while my base spit out as many units as I could for a heroic last stand.  The third line was whoever else was left at the time the other two lines fell.  As I checked my units upgrades and made sure they had all they could have, then I saw a red tide on the minimap.  I realized the Emperor would be seeing us soon in the next life.As the enemy forces through themselves at the turrets, I couldn't help but realize the corpses of the dead.  The game has an option that leaves almost all the corpses on the field, and I recommend to turn it on to the max as it adds satisfaction to the price your men are paying.  The turrets and supporting infantry could only hold on for so long.  Before the line was breached I was in about a 7:1 kd ratio.  After the line was broken, it became a 1:1.  I zoomed in close for a final look at these men, and I grinned for I knew we would all be joining him soon.  The second line held for about half the time.  The third and final line consisted of my commander and everyone else that had not died.  I waited until the enemy was within weapon's range, then I lit them up with artillery, orbital strikes, and the last two flyers I had.  Then, my men charged.  They went down valiantly with many enemies dead in the process.  I knew there was no chance for victory from the very beginning, but I watched as my commander made his final defiant yell, I was sad there was never a chance.  I was fighting for time, and I got a lot of time.  We fought until the final drop of blood was spilt, until the final breath was exhaled, until the fat♥♥♥♥♥ho sang, until the bitter end.  These are the moments that define gaming, not the scripted ones that everyone encounters, but the ones that are player-made.  The game modes where the goal is to kill the enemy commander, and you are completely surrounded on all sides and you make a final charge to kill him to gain victory, and you see your numbers fall from 30 to 23 to 14 to 6 until all you have left is two guardsmen (they die sooooooo easily) and a tank that has a third of its health left and you win.  You win against all the odds, and you smirk at the trail of the men that died for victory.  I cannot tell you of all the awesomeness that is this game.  Go get it.IN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FAR FUTURE THERE IS ONLY WAR.  AND A METRIC♥♥♥♥♥♥TON (THAT IS A ♥♥♥♥ING MEASUREMENT) OF ENEMY INFANTRY.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stop reading this, buy all the DOW games. Look don't ask just buy it, you won't regret it. In particular buy the master collection, i'll explain why below:Why buy Master? Master comes with all the factions fully playable in multiplayer and single player skirmishes, that's why. Simply download, install and play all of them at least once and you have full access to everything. You get 9-10 factions all together, 9-10 factions that all play /very/ differently with their own fun and unique tactics.so look i'll do a review just for fun, but hurry up and buy it, you won't regret it:Pros: Fun open campaign: None of this boring DOW:II campaigns where its ""OH LOOK ITS THE SPACE MARRINES WE'RE SO SPACE MARINEY""Diverse factions: Space Marines, Imperial Guads, Necrons, Tau, Eldar etc don't play alike, at all. They each play very differently and are relatively balanced. Try them out they're also all flavoured differently so if you're into BDSM I suggest playing Dark Eldar. If you're a pyromaniac who loves girls with big guns, may I direct you to the Sisters of Battle. If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ I will direct you to the Space Marines. If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ with some angst I would direct you to the Chaos Space Marines.Multiplayer: By gaming standards this game is old, but there is still an active multiplayer community, thats more then DOW:II can really say.Army Painter: Ever look at your GLORIOUS IMPERIAL GUARD WITH BALLS OF ♥♥♥♥ING STEEL and say, gee they look stupid, they NEED TO BE ♥♥♥♥ING PINK, well guess what: You can customize the colour schemes for your army, if you want to create an army of Pink Necrons or Imperial Guards from the Planet majesta then go on ahead and do it.Replay value: This game has a lot of replay value in multiplayer and campaigns. CONS:Graphics are a bit dated, but thats okay, it means it can run on your rig.the multiplayer can be difficult at times, i've lost sometimes very fast.NO Tyranids. I think there are mods that fix this but I don't bother with them, I hated the Tyranids in DOW:II OP AS♥♥♥♥♥♥ This might be a pro, idk.Guides are currently ""Meh"" on the steam community section, most of them being troll guides.Some  SPESS MEHREENS (Space Marines) chapters are not represented beyond some pre-made skins for them. So if you're expecting to bring out some Space Wolves the best you'll get is some light blue power armour for your  SPESS MEHREENS. But, who cares they're  SPESS MEHREENS.Final notes: IF you're still reading this you're wasting your time when you could be burning the heretics and slaying the Xenos in the name of the EMPRAH. But in all seriousness Soulstorm is a recommended one to buy along with any other expansion as soulstorm is where peep's go to play multiplayer. But Soulstorm only comes with Dark Eldar and Sisters of battle. See other expansions for their factions. Or buy the Master collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The squad system revolutionized RTS. Nothing has been quite the same since.The addition of two races in the final expansion of what I daresay is the RTS of the decade was not surprising, but maybe raised a few eyebrows. To some, updating this game with more content seemed a waste - why bother spending time on adding things to a game whose graphics could easily be dismissed as much too old for the current era?And yet, Dawn of War remains timeless, and so does this expansion. A sprawling campaign, active online community (even now, in a time of ""superior"" graphics and smoother gameplay), and a well thought-out set of mechanics that ensured every race had their advantages and disadvantages, some canceling each other out, others complementing each other, to create a blend of nine staggeringly complex races.The learning curve of some races is high, and low for some others. There's something in this game for anyone who's even thought about playing an RTS. Mastering a race is, in itself, a reward. And a set of over a hundred maps, ranging from tiny two-person maps to sprawling eight-person arenas, will only add to the experience of doing so.Overall, 10/10. Solid soundtrack as always, decent enough graphics (they were ahead for their time when the first game was released) without taking too much of a toll on your system, eye-opening variation in mechanics for all nine races.

												This game is just simply badass and awesome. The campaign is good, there is many races and the AI is really challenging on insane. With mods this game shines like gold (especially the Ultimate Apocalypse mod which I really recommend). The gameplay itself is smooth and well done-each unit is important, 1 building, 1 research, 1 Commander can change the tide of battle but you're gonna need a really strong processor for it if you wanna run the game with hundreds of units on the field, otherwise you will get command lag. The game's graphics are great for a game engine that came out in 2004 (you can even use SweetFX, ENB or other stuff like that to improve it even further). I didn't even mentoin that you can improve the game's graphics and detail on units just by typing some simple commands in the Local.ini and the game starts looking SO GOOD. The only real con for this game is that you have to buy first 3 Dawn of War games to unlock all races for the multiplayer but its damn well worth it.10/10       =====MUST BUY=====			",91,8,3,10,8,0,24

												7/10 good but dead.The final episode of Dawn of War brings the battle to new heights.As well as adding new races to help provide new challenges (As a Dark Eldar player on the TableTop, I really thought they captured the essence well, btw) they introduce Flyers (for most races anyway) and new abilities. The single-player campaign is slightly more nuanced than it was in Dark Crusade, with new strategic choices to be made. Multi-playeris not as strong as it was, a vast amount of mods create all sorts of possibilities, but so many players have moved on to DoW2 now.Get the whole load of Dawn of War, and play through the lot of them. It's a great story of Orky  Percy  puse persevy  Stubborn stikkin with it until they all goes pop!			",514,169,14,124,78,7,213

												One of the greatest tactical RTS games of all time.  Dawn of War has aged fine, but the expansions are somewhat questionable.  Vanilla + Winter Assault seem to be the best versions of the game.  The races added in the other two add variety and fun, but there are some balance issues later on, most likely attributable to the game studio going out of business.  If you're a fan of sci-fi RTS, these games are a must-have.			",130,13,2,8,10,2,39

												In this game I've:- Killed a Tyrannid Hive Tyrant with 100 men armed with basically laser pointers.- Stopped a charge of 100 heavily armored and highly attractive women screaming ""FOR THE EMPRAH"" with 3 Badass and likely homosexual Space Marines Commanders.- Used artillery incorrectly.- Used artillery correctly with♥♥♥♥♥all results. - Bit/Headbutted a tank to death with a Giant T-Rex thing that immediately got stabbed to death by a demon. - Came up with the concept of the movie Pacific Rim: Chaos Defiler vs Squiggoth.- Had a bunch of Orcs with crude axes overrun a highly advanced civilization that utilized plasma weapons and railguns.- Overran a group of genetic supersoldiers with a endless sea of tiny ant like creatures. - Recovered the morale of my own men by having their commanding officer chant ""The Emprah protects.""- Recovered the morale of my own men by having their commanding officer shoot one of them in the head.- Recovered the morale of my own men by having them scream Russian war chants. (WAAAAGGGGHHHH).- Used magic to fight railguns.- Used railguns to fight magic. - Sent highly attractive elf-ladies with lightsabres (?) to fight literally anything and anyone. While screaming.- Built a titan.- Built tactical nuke launcher.- Nuked said titan accidentally. - Built legions of tanks. - Lost legions of tanks to individual command staff. - Fought robotic zombies. - Killed robotic zombies. - Killed those exact same robotic zombies again. - Commanded the space version of the Inquisition.- Armed elite soldiers with nothing but flamethrowers and flashbangs.- Lost said elite soldiers to armies of literal demons.- Commanded legions of the Emprahs finest - the Grey Knights.- Watched the Grey Knights fight things with ye'olde fisticuffs despite being armed to the teeth.- Was a demon lord and created an army of Succubi. - Lost all the succubi to one (presumably married and intensely faithful) Space Marine Commander.- Learned Space Marine Commanders can't marry. - Lost all the succubi to one badass gay Space Marine Commander. - Sang war chants with a group of friends as we fought thousands of bugs with sentient fungi.- Cheered with friends as we held waves of hundreds of men with small bands of aliens.- Laughed with friends as we fought off unbelieveable odds with literal demons.And the list goes on. Its ridiculous exactly how much entertainment this game provides, and its moddable to become the single best Warhammer 40k experience available on the PC. If your even a slight fan of the universe, this is 100% a must buy. Timeless gameplay, endlessly moddable, and amazingly fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 I have played over two hundred hours of this game, it can be extremely fun, and at other times stupidly irratating and dull. The random function of this game be it for races or spawns has it quirks, but atleast it's there. The graphic quality isnt really all that bad considering how old it is. Gameplay is great, it isn't laggy at all, you dont need a super computer, and the campaign kicks total @ss compared to the original game. So in the Emperors name, For the chaos gods, be it the greater good you aspire for, or simply to cause violence for your own sake and have the biggest waaaaagh yet, go out there and conquer the galaxy!

												Do you know when you truly love a game? When almost 12 years after it's launch, the giddy excitement of running home from work to play it never actually wore off.Don't let my playtime fool you, I owned the boxed versions of these games loooong before they were in my Steam account and have invested literally THOUSANDS of hours into this game. I was always kind of interested in 40K, having roomates who played the tabletop when I was younger and reading the odd comic here and there, but THIS was the game that turned me into a 40K fanboy and opened me up to the whole universe.Now before I go any further, if you want the definitive version of Dawn of War for its best balance in both mutliplayer and a better designed single player campaign then buy Dark Crusade. It was the pinnacle of the series. There are two reasons why I play Soulstorm more than Dark Crusade, the first is that the multiplayer community seems to be much more active on SS than it is on DC, the second and infinitely more important reason is what the games community simply refers to by two letters......UA.The ""Ultimate Apocalypse"" mod for Soul Storm or ""UA"" for short, has become the absolute best Warhammer 40k game ever made. The following are just the things that I personally like about the mod, but doesn't even tip the iceburg for what it encompasses :-expands the maps and removes level caps so the truly epic 40K battles can expand in scope-introduces new races including Inquisition, Chaos Daemons, Tyranids and more...-introduced tons of new untis for exsiting races-new buildings, superweapons and tech trees to explore for all races-better balancing than vanilla for multiplayer-constant updates and new content all the timeand of course......TITANS!!!!The only thing I can hope for (because lets not kid ourselves, Relic is working on DoW 3) is that they make the next game much more like UA in design and get away from the smaller tactical stuff they did with DoW 2.All in all this is my favorite game of all time and the first and to date ONLY time I will score a game with a perfect 10/10. Bravo Relic and the UA team,  everyone's got a fave....and you made mine.			",488,97,11,36,33,6,68

												Back in 2004 Relic unleashed the original Dawn of War, a real-time strategy game, and established its distinctive, polished take on control point capture gameplay. The game shifted focus from base building to managing units in the field and provided an enjoyable method of resource collection. It didn't hurt that it was based in a universe as rich as Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 fiction, where blood, beastly deeds, and brutal combat are commonplace.Since then we've seen two expansions, Winter Assault and the superb Dark Crusade. While Dark Crusade changed quite a bit about the single-player campaign, the third expansion, Soulstorm, doesn't offer much that's surprising. Naturally there's more content like two new armies, a retooled persistent campaign, flying units, and more maps, but there isn't much that drastically alters how players experience the game. That being said, it still features fantastically addictive RTS gameplay, even if the formula seems a little tired at this point, particularly after Relic advanced their capture point mechanic with Company of Heroes in 2006.The new factions include the Sisters of Battle, a predominantly female band of holy crusaders, and the Dark Eldar, a twisted version of the Eldar. Though they manage to retain their own distinct personalities and unique elements of play, things are really starting to blend together with a total of nine armies in the game. Despite the overcrowded selection, the two additions are nevertheless entertaining. The Sisters' strength seems to be with their infantry groups, augmented by the ability to attach certain units for added firepower, abilities, or healing. Several of their unit groupings can be customized with weaponry to bust up other infantry, puncture vehicles, and more rapidly destroy buildings, making them effective throughout the course of a game. Limiting some of their unit abilities is a new resource called faith, generated by upgrading capture point structures with special additions. Building and maintaining faith doesn't result in any kind of dramatically different play style, however.With the Dark Eldar you get a different kind of resource to worry about: soul essence. Several units possess a harvest ability, which when activated consumes the essence contained in the corpses of enemies. Reaping soul essence on the battlefield is somewhat pointless, however, as you can have your unit cap management structures back in your base constantly spawn bodies. By assigning a builder unit or two to harvest, a constant stream of the stuff is ensured, so there's little strategy to the whole mechanic, making it feel more like busywork. With enough essence, Dark Eldar players can unleash spells on foes ranging from a few area-of-effect damage strikes to morale modifiers.The rest of the armies have received minor tweaks, the most notable being flying units. After toying around with them, the units don't feel like they've been integrated very well. Though they can hover across terrain, they don't seem to do much to alter how you'd play had they not been included. Fans of Dark Crusade's persistent campaign will almost certainly enjoy the single-player here, which is basically the same thing. Instead of a single continent the territory for Soulstorm is broken up across several planets, though the number of contestable provinces isn't all that much more. The Sisters of Battle get the added ability to establish forward bases with their command point spoils and the Dark Eldar aren't restricted by the paths to hop between planets like other armies are. As in Dark Crusade, you gain access to special gear and powered-up units that accompany heroes into each battle and can reinforce territory using requisition points gained from expanding across the map.Tying together the campaign is a flimsy exposition describing why all the races are converging on this section of the galaxy. To say it's compelling is to lie. More narrative is delivered as you assault stronghold provinces and have to deal with several special objectives to wipe enemies off the map for good, but you'll find more character and personality in each race's unit acknowledgements than in the cut-scenes. Soulstorm is almost entirely about the combat.And the combat is enjoyable, helped along by the audio and visual elements that effectively convey the carnage and blind aggression Warhammer 40K is known for. Units and vehicles closely resemble their table top equivalents and their personalities come across clearly through animations and often hilarious unit speech. The Dark Eldar builder unit's terrified responses to construction and movement commands were a personal favorite.The VerdictSoulstorm's development was handled mostly by Iron Lore (the recently-closed developer best known for Titan Quest) and they've produced a solid expansion. The main issue here is just that everything feels so familiar. While the game still plays quite well and Warhammer 40K fans will surely appreciate all the unit designs for the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar, too little has been done to enliven the experience, particularly when compared to what Dawn of War's previous expansion, Dark Crusade, did for the game.+Still Exciting Campaign Mode+Two More Races Mean More Fun+Aircraft And Wargear Expansion-Balancing Issues-Not Much New Things To Offer Review Score: 71/100			",724,250,27,108,104,10,98

												Still the greatest RTS ever made.Better than DOW2, better than SupCom, better than everything.The amount of factions is staggering and they are all reasonably balanced (pros might disagreem but no race is gimped enough so that a slightly skilled player will lose to a lesser player because of choosing an OP faction).Space marines... orks... tau... Sisters... imperial guard.... necrons... and MORE.And they all play differently.This is a masterpiece.This is perfection in gaming.If you play solo, highly recommended that you get the AI skirmish mod which makes the AI more challenging and more like a human opponent.If you like competitive multiplayer, this is STILL played online every day.

												Multiplayer now Gamespy free! (Steamworks)(Single player review) Every species and faction from the previous Dawn of War main game + Expansions, with two new factions and a campaign that is almost a copy of Dark Crusade. Which is a good thing, considering how much fun Dark Crusade was with the added burden of choices and a persistent battlefield. The two new factions possess enough uniqueness to make them viable alternatives to the series mainstays. I've personally come to prefer the Sisters of Battle over Chaos due to the Sister's faith mechanic, where faith serves as a resource for various units to use for healing and attack bonuses in addition to whatever normal abilities the units possess. The Sisters also have a much greater reliance on melee and flame-based weapons compared to many of the other factions. I personally have no interest in the Dark Eldar, but the new faction's soul-harvesting mechanic dosen't sound like anything the other factions have.My only real complaint agianst Soulstorm is that the additions to the single player campain seem poorly planed. Firstly, there's very little in the way of additions from Dark Crusade, but this isn't automatically a bad thing. What is troublesome, however, is that the main change, a move from a single planet battlefield to multiple, dosen't allow for zoom or any perspective changes. This means you may encounter difficulty seeing areas of the main battle map, where you view your territories and the territories of your enemies, at higher resolutions. Some tactical planning may be hampered by this, but this is not a large complaint.If you have any interest in 40k, or if you are tired of Dark Crusade, or even if you just want to see a mostly-female (not all female, for some reason) human faction (I can't tell when it comes to the Eldar, but I guess they're female, too), pick up this game.  You don't need the other Dawn of War 1 games unless you really like space marine (Dawn of War base game) or Imperial Guard (Winter Assualt) plotlines. You will need the other games to unlock the other factions in multiplayer (already have all factions unlocked for any and all single player aspects).Gameplay:

												One of my favorite RTS-games. Sadly, the campaign is not as epic as the one from Dark Crusade but you don't care about that. Maybe you're like me, and asked yourself ""Dark Crusade was fun and all - but where's the flamers at?"". Luckily, your prayers were answered in Soulstorm by introducing Sisters of Battle. Have you ever wanted to burn the enemies of the Imperium? Have you ever wished you could wield a tank with spinning flamers? Have you ever said to yourself ""I wish there would be a race that would be EXTREMELY devoted to the God-Emperor of Man! Even more than the Space Marines!""? then you'll love Sisters of Battle. Wield flamers on your troops, flamers on your tanks, flamers on your open-topped walkers, flamers on your turrets - all while God-Emperor boosts your units' health and makes their ammo deadlier thanks to Acts of Faith exclusive to SoB.10/10 would flame for Emperor again.

												It's a classic. What else is there to say? This game as aged very well. Lots of content, this game respects the lore of Warhammer 40k and it's awesome. The RTS play of this game might not be the most MLG one, but sure can give you some stressful games where you're on the edge. The battles are absolutly epic with a fairly big scale when played 4v4. The style of play can be comparable to age of empires, but the units are in squads. Unlike his younger brother, DoW 2, it makes economy and macro gestion really important and battles of a bigger scale.If you're looking for a classic RTS with a great, already established lore and some epic action, this game would be a good choice.

												Compared to Dawn of War - Dark Crusade:+ it has two more factions to play as (Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar)+ it adds an air unit to all existing factions+ it's the latest Dawn of War game, so it comes with the most up to date ""balance patch"" for multiplayer- pretty much everything elseThe main issue with Soulstorm is, that the developers basically copied the successful campaign mode from Dark Crusade and only made it worse (I assume they didn't spend too much money on this installment anymore). The new commanders, their writing and voice acting is horrible compared to Dark Crusade. I mean the Necron Lord not only *talks* (whereas in DC, the talking was done cleverly by a humanoid hybrid Pariah, the other Necron units remaining almost always silent), he talks like he's got lung cancer. The Space Marines' Boreale lacked so much charisma that they had him canonically killed off after this game. All the other new commanders are basically just copied but worse versions of their Dark Crusade equivalents. The only two exceptions are - the Imperial Guard commander, Vance Stubbs, who's still worse than Alexander from Dark Crusade (especially in terms of voice acting), but at least he's got some character of his own - and the Ork commander, Warboss Gorgutz, because he's the only one returning from Dark Crusade.But even writing/character/likability/voice acting aside, the campaign is worse in gameplay aspects as well. For some reason, the developers felt the need to ""rebalance"" the gameplay portion of the campaign, even though it's single player only. That means that everything got toned down - almost all of the Commanders' best upgrades got nerfed. As if that wasn't enough, defense missions are also extremely painful now. Why? Because in Dark Crusade, all sturctures that you've built in a mission would remain on the map the next time you play. That was mostly to compensate for the fact that you don't start out with your Commander/Honor Guard as you would normally when attacking. In Soulstorm, they removed that, so every single time, all the structures you've built magically disappear from the map after you win. Having to play the same two-three maps over and over and over again on the enemy's turn when he's attacking you, always starting from just your HQ and your stationed units there is incredibly boring and time consuming. And to top it all off, they also nerfed the bonuses you get - there are no longer any specials ""out there"" on the map for you to get, only Honor Guard. Some tiny production bonuses are also scattered around the map, but they're not even worth the time, really. Instead, every faction starts with its own special bonus that the others get after conquering their HQ. That sounds like nice balance on paper, but it's not really, since many of the factions start with useless arbirtrary stuff (Tau, Necrons), absolutely worthless stuff (Chaos), while the downright overpowered specials, of course, belong to the Eldar and the Sisters of Battle.Overall, a good game for what it is, and if you want to play the multiplayer, but if you're looking for a nice single player campaign experience, I'd recommend Dark Crusade instead.

												If you looking for a solid RTS then look no more because this one is gold! If you looking for a RTS game with loads of armies, then this is the one for you! Theres enough fractions to make anyone happy. Every fraction has lots of upgrades/spells/troop choices and a army painter, you can make the mighty Space marines look all pink and cute haha. Only thing i would say is kinda lame is the story, its pretty general for all fractions, Take every peice of land on each planet to achive victory. Works well on Wondows 10 from what i can tell, i have not ran into any problems at all. Overall a great game 8/10			",35,1,0,3,1,1,9

												This is definitely one of the best RTS games out there, have been playing it for 8 years now (not all the time) but I have not found any RTS that matches this. here are a few reasons why.1. The huge range of units and races:Ok so most RTS games will default to 3 or 4 factions, this one however (as long as you have all the other expansions and core game) gives you up to 9 playable races. and its not like their all similar either, each race is completely unique and different.2. no rule restrictions:So some RTS games I have recently had a look at will limit rules, for instance you cannot set your own teams, map position etc. This has a wide range of rules you can change to your way of playing.3. The huge ammount of maps:I have looked at some of the new RTS games, and one thing that turns me off is the map selection. They will have about 10-20 maps, usually with 1 map being an 8 player (if they even have 8 players allowed) this game however has over 100 maps! With both even maps for competitive matches or more unfair maps for free for alls, 2v2v2's 2v2v2v2's etc.4. The game play is both fun to watch, and very competitive (suits any style of play)Even after 4+ years of playing this game, I still learn new things, tactics, this game is very balanced, and there is no issue of players spamming mass of units to win.If you do get this game and enjoy it, I strongly reccomend you download the supermod 'Ultimate Apocalypse mod' The latest version is 'The Hunt Begins'Here is a link to the group if you were interested: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/uamg ",92,7,1,7,5,0,8

												Dawn of War is one of the best RTS games ever made, and Soulstorm lives up to the high expectations set by the previous expansions in the series. At first I was reluctant to buy it because I was wary of the air units and tedious campaign I had heard about, but I'm glad I didn't let that dissuade me. The two new races aren't as different as the Necron and Tau were for Dark Crusade but they are still well made, and the air units are actually nice; I never had to change my preferred strategy or tactics in order to accommodate their addition. Overall Soulstorm is much more balanced as well, no more getting rushed by Necrons in the first few minutes of a game and being able to do almost nothing about it.When you eventually get bored of the vanilla game, the modding community is still quite active for a game of its age. Many people like the Ultimate Apocalypse mod, and while it is fun and adds some cool units, it's poorly balanced and has some features that just make the game feel cheap at times (ork squad cap in the hundreds, feeble necrons, armageddon-like technologies, for example). I recommed downloading Firestorm over Kaurava instead for a much more polished, balanced, and true-to-codex experience that adds many new units and some cool strategic mechanics to the game. I've been playing the game almost daily for weeks now thanks to the mods, they're well worth it.TL,DR: If you have doubts about getting this game but you loved the past expansions, buy it now. The vanilla is great, mods make it even better.			",10,0,0,2,0,0,9

												I've been playing this game for years, an excellent example of what can be achieved in RTS and does a pretty good job with balance, and the campaign is solid too. After that, there are great customisations, upgrades and a wide variety of maps if you're more interested in skirmishes or playing online. I haven't messed around too much with mods but Ultimate Apocalypse is amazing.Pros- Wide variety in playable armies, each one has unique aspects and you can play the campagin with each faction, knowing that it will feel like a different experience.- Large variety of unit types and styles of battling, represents this side of the warhammer 40k world pretty well- Base battles in the campaign are awesome, often very challenging but are really fun in my opinion- The progression throughout a battle is really well done, it also challenges you to be efficient in the way you prioritise the buildings you go for firstCons- Necrons are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>- I preferred it when all the campaign battles were HQ destruction victories, sometimes the take and hold gets really annoying since you have to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for a game to end- Stealth can feel a little unbalanced at times, if you have a small army and they lose their stealth detection unit, you'll be completely screwed against EldarOverall, I love this game. The issues I've mentioned are quite minor and the positives far outweigh the negatives. Even if you aren't familiar with warhammer this game will be really enjoyable to you.9/10			",10,1,0,4,15,0,6

												This is an awesome game! Passed the whole game in 20h.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The game graphics are cool, but on some armies it looks a bit downgraded-The game has 9 playable campaigns, each with different factions and outcomes of the war-Nice models for armies-They have added 2 more playable factions, Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle-The game has some minor bugs but they aren't affecting the gameplay-Community is alive-The game isn't forgotten, but it can use a bit more of patching. But as said before, those minor bugs don't affect the gameplay-The Multiplayer is alive, there are more players on this game then on other games of this franchise-The game is repetitive, I have passed couple of campaigns before I have gotten the game on SteamCONS-Campaign is a bit too hard if you are new to RTS-When you conquer a teritorry, the base you have built does not stay and if you get attacked you will have to expand and upgrade your base again. The basic base buildings will only stay if you have ability Forward BaseI recommend this game. 9/10 would subjugate Kaurava System again!			",89,1,3,1,7,0,7

												This is probably the best RTS and I played most of them from Dune 2 to Starcraft 2. If you could not stand your armies being obliterated in 2 seconds like in Starcraft 2 you might try this game. Battles take time and you can have fun even if you loose. The resources comes from points that you need to control so there is no turtling and there is constant action all around.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The pluses: + Best RTS gameplay  + Nice campaigns with cool, good quality videos (worth to get all expansions for all campaigns)  + Graphics are good even today and the art style is fantastic  + Cool animations when you get special kills. Throwing, cutting slices, blood split around...  + Awesome voice acting and great sound affects  + Good music  + 9 distinctive races in multiplayer - (you must get all expansions to get them all to play against humans, but in skirmish against AI all are present and available) Some with different resource mechanics.# Orcs - green skin brute killers that like axes and bigga guns ""Orkz Orkz"" # Space marines - genetically modified humans with awesome mechs and tanks ""For the Emperor"" # Chaos - tainted space marines with Demons on their side ""Do you hear the voices too?"" # Eldar - Elf-like aliens with sophisticated technology # Imperial Guard - Imperial Army that rely on spamming large masses of soldiers and tanks # Tau - advanced race fighting ""For the Greater Good"" # Necrons - living metal organisms # Sisters of Battle - female order dedicated to worship of the Emperor ""To the Emperor, my life; to Him, my death."" # Dark Eldar - Eldars tainted by Chaos that harvest Soul Essence from fallen opponents  + Many game modes for (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, Free Fall All) and settings (control and hold 50% of points, 66%, Annihilate etc.)  + Pretty fast to find a game in lobby (even for 8 players)  + Still living community+ Lots of mods (some add new factions and many new units)------------------------------------------------------The minuses:- code for servers is bugged (sometimes players drop at beginning because out of sync)  - 1v1 Automatch sometimes take some time to find opponent (but instead you can create game in lobby and someone will get in pretty fast)  - Automatching for bigger number of players (more than 1v1) might take A LOT of time (but like I sad before, games in lobby are filled fast)  - Stats displayed for players are bugged======================================The game is definitely worth to get.

The resources comes from points that you need to control so there is no turtling and there is constant action all around.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The pluses: + Best RTS gameplay  + Nice campaigns with cool, good quality videos (worth to get all expansions for all campaigns)  + Graphics are good even today and the art style is fantastic  + Cool animations when you get special kills. Throwing, cutting slices, blood split around...  + Awesome voice acting and great sound affects  + Good music  + 9 distinctive races in multiplayer - (you must get all expansions to get them all to play against humans, but in skirmish against AI all are present and available) Some with different resource mechanics.# Orcs - green skin brute killers that like axes and bigga guns ""Orkz Orkz"" # Space marines - genetically modified humans with awesome mechs and tanks ""For the Emperor"" # Chaos - tainted space marines with Demons on their side ""Do you hear the voices too?"" # Eldar - Elf-like aliens with sophisticated technology # Imperial Guard - Imperial Army that rely on spamming large masses of soldiers and tanks # Tau - advanced race fighting ""For the Greater Good"" # Necrons - living metal organisms # Sisters of Battle - female order dedicated to worship of the Emperor ""To the Emperor, my life; to Him, my death."" # Dark Eldar - Eldars tainted by Chaos that harvest Soul Essence from fallen opponents  + Many game modes for (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, Free Fall All) and settings (control and hold 50% of points, 66%, Annihilate etc.)  + Pretty fast to find a game in lobby (even for 8 players)  + Still living community+ Lots of mods (some add new factions and many new units)------------------------------------------------------The minuses:- code for servers is bugged (sometimes players drop at beginning because out of sync)  - 1v1 Automatch sometimes take some time to find opponent (but instead you can create game in lobby and someone will get in pretty fast)  - Automatching for bigger number of players (more than 1v1) might take A LOT of time (but like I sad before, games in lobby are filled fast)  - Stats displayed for players are bugged======================================The game is definitely worth to get.

												This game is amazing. It is extremely fun and easy to have massive battles in. I personally prefer soulstorm to dark crusade because of the extra factions. After you have played this there is also 1 sequel already out (Dawn of War II) with 2 expansions and a 2nd sequel (Dawn of War III) which has been announced today 3rd May 2016 so there is plenty more Dawn of War to enjoy. The Ultimate Apocalypse mod for this is also probably my favourite mod of all time. PRAISE BE THE EMPEROR FOR GIVING US THIS GAME.			",40,1,1,8,6,1,36

												Ahh Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War, a game i just adore. I sunk countless hours into Dawn of War when i had the Disc copy of Dark Crusade. I've always been a fan of Warhammer 40,000 ever since i took my first trip into a GAMES WORKSHOP store when i was about 10. Playing the Table Top version currently, Warhammer is one of my favourite fictional universes. Dawn of War is a fantastic RTS game that has all the flair a 40K game should have. Having 9 playable Races as of the Soulstorm expansion; Space Marines, Eldar, Orcs, Chaos, Tau, Necrons, Imperial Guard, Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar, the game has a massive variety. It fearures the classic RTS style gameplay, base building and epic tonnes of units to destroy your foes with. Dawn of War II was such a dissapointment in my opinion as it didn't hold any of the key features the original had. The campaign is solid and has you travelling across the Kaurava system, eliminating any opposing armies in a grand game of Galactic Conquest. The Multiplayer is where it's at. Challenge friends, or test your luck online in skirmishes that can last between 15 minutes to 2 hours, each game being epic. If you haven't played Dawn of War (you've got something wrong with you) then pick it up, and experience one of the greatest RTS games ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULLTHRONE! MILK FOR THE KHORNE FLAKES! BUTTER FOR THE POP KHORNE!Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War - Soulstorm is another RTS-Game set in the grim darkness of the far future. While having added two more playable factions (Dark Eldar and the Adeptus Sororitas), Soulstorm balances things out a bit better. The Singleplayer-Campaign is interesting enough as you can choose from all the playable factions to conquer the Kaurava-System. It does feature things like Indrick Boreale's infamous speech impediment as well as Firaevous Carron's METAL BAWKSES.All in all, if you are looking for a great RTS-Game with mediocre voice acting - seek no longer!

												I've played all the Dawn of War expansions and I think this is my favourite. There's two new races (Sisters of Battle and Derk Eldar), and all the exisiting races get an air unit. The use of a conquest campaign (like in Dark Crusade) also help the replayability! I did get the impression that the campaign wasn't as polished (not as many cutscenes) as Dark Crusade but it was still better, largely due to the additional races and more territories.I'm not a tabletop Warhammer fan, and Dawn of War: Dark Crusade was my first look into the 40k universe, so I don't know how well displayed the races are or anything like that, but as a RTS game this is brilliant. Dark Crusade was so good I went and got the Dawn of War and Dawn of War: Winter Assault on Steam. However, Dark Crusade was my favourite of the three, and Soulstorm is more in the Dark Crusade vein. You have to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of your race and decide what your best tactic is for fighting each different race. So to a degree you have to keep changing up your tactic to suit the battle; I play as the Imperial Guard and my preferred tactic (from Dark Crusade's Annilation maps) is to dig in at first, build up my army and once I've tanks, artillery and infantry, push out and steamroll the enemy. In some maps, you need to take over 50% of the critical locations so I had to adapt my strategy.All in all, the new races are a fun addition. The air support also lends another depth to the game, while still keeping the Dark Crusade style intact. The conquest campaign with multiple planets also made the grand strategy more important to your conquest plan. I'd definitely reccommend this game, even if you already have Dark Crusade. Also, it's standalone, so even if you don't have any Dawn of War games you can still play it - so get it either way!!Also, check out moddb.com for the Strongholds mod, which lets you play all of the stronghold missions from Dark Crusade and Soulstorm as any race, against any race!

												Now, I`m not here to write one of those really bad reviews where people say ""good game. you should buy it"" No. Im here to write one of those reviews to get you playing those RTS games you deserve. Now, this game i have to say is one of the best RTS`s out there because of the range of choices you need to make throughout any type of gameplay. If you want to play a REALLY GOOD RTS game play This because i have played this game now for over 150 hrs and if i am writing this review in this detail, you should get it to.The Pros: 1) Multiplayer/Skirmish - So far whenever i play this game on multiplayer at least 20 people are always and most of them are very good players because they practise. Noobs - Dont worry, Skirmish is always available for you to practise and this is where the customization part comes in, you can choose who to play and who to play against, You can choose your team mates and team enemies, you can even change the rules of the game to suit you.2)Campaign - You can choose which race to play between the nine classes (Tau, Eldar, Dark eldar, Imperial guard, Space Marines, Orks, Sisters of Battle, Chaos and Necrons) and fight against the other eight classes for system Domination !!The Cons:(imagine a scene in the desert with a weed slowly being blown across the screen :D)I hope this has made your mind over the fact that this is a great RTS game and that you will buy it in the future.Thanks for reading.                                 ~Rinthallion			",157,23,7,23,33,3,54

												Basically Dark Crusade again, but with two more factions, a few new units, and a different planet to take over. This still feels lazy with how little they added for this expansion, and so normally I would throw this in a bin and tell it to bugger off.But since it's basically a (slightly) larger version of Dark Crusade, I guess that means this is good too. Yeah, lets go with that. You may as well get this one instead, to be honest, since it has more stuff.			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												If you love the 40k universe, as I do, then you will love this game.This is basically a larger version of Dark Crusade, with very little changing to the playable races. There is the addition of flying units, though I have only found the Space Marine flyer to be of any real use, the others are pretty much a waste.  The two new races are the Sisters of Battle, whose tanks suck but have strong and relatively cheap infantry. I didn't think they have strong heavy weapons teams though. The other new race is the Dark Eldar, who are supposed to be fast, but individual units are weak and they don't seem to have a vehicle that get stompy Except for their Robo-Scorpion thing, which looks like it should belong to Chaos or Necrons, but it is a very solid smasher, and three of them will wreck most bases by themselves.I wish they would make more of these Dawn of War games rather than the small unit focused sequel.  I, for one, would like to see Chaos armies with specific Chaos God patronage...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Soulstorm is a great RTS game. 9 different races guarantee a significant replayability and its campaign while not as good as the Dark Crusade one (in my opinion) also provides some good play times, especially on stronghold missions. Soulstorm is an extremely moddable game just like Dawn of War and the other expansions and that adds to the replayability of this game. If you ever get bored playing it, with just a few time and dedication you can change the game into something quite different, thus providing you with even more fun play time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The black sheep of the Dawn of War 1 family, Soulstorm is admittedly a bit buggy, and has some of the weakest writing in the franchise. But we wouldn't still be making jokes about Indrick Boreale and his legendary baldness if it wasn't at least somewhat endearing. I can hardly blame Iron Lore for this game's shortcomings, as they were on their way out as it was. Go play Titan Quest or Grim Dawn if you want a real example of what that studio can do. What endeared Soulstorm to me as it is the only game I've played to date where the Sisters of Battle, one of the most underappricated factions in the setting by both players and creators, were not only present but playable. I played Soulstorm as much as I played Dark Crusade, and indeed any other Dawn of War title, and remember it as fondly.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												""In the grim dark future there is only war.""This game. Woo boy! Plunging you into the world of Warhammer 40k, Dawn Of War makes you the commander of armies. Me, as a Necron player, take pride in seeing the hopeless imperial guard crushed by immortals and warriors.I defenitly recommend this game to fans of RTS games or Warhammer fans. 10/10 would come back from dead and kill guardsmen again.

												It's a great game, even after all these years, but:1. They disabled LAN play. Which sucks big time. This does drastically increase the chance of problems during gameplay, which would not be necessary for people who mainly play on LAN (such as me...)2. The new server code is buggy as hell. Meaning, you'll likely get desyncs while playing a multiplayer game. And that results in the end of that game.So the previously perfectly working LAN games are now broken...So if you would like to buy this game for LAN games, DO NOT buy it on steam. Get it on DVD.

												Dawn of War:Soulstorm Is an amazing work of art that i have come to love over the course of my time playing the DoW seiries. This installment is the best one yet and is even better the the DoW2 seiries. The amount of time effort and care put into this game is just insane. Dont worry about your multiplayer expirence being ruined because the game is old, They changed their multiplayer system to run on the steam servers from gamespy so you can enjoy multiplayer as much as back in its Glory days. Dawn of war soulstorm has a high replay value despite the fact that the campaign may seem the same for all races. The way that the galaxy map is setup each playthrough will have different results. On one of my playthroughs as necrons i couldnt take the eldar stronghold, and after going to the Planet above me and capturing the IG's Stronghold the eldar somehow wiped me out (I still hate them to this day >:c). You can customize the colors of your army and Customize various strategies, as the population cap CANNOT hold 1 squad of each unit, making strategy a must. Although population caps are low, The implementation of squads in the game make it so their are actually LOTS of units on the screen but also makes them much more manageable, And if you have a good PC and are a bit more bloodthirsty you can use mods to raise the population limit in singleplayer AND Multiplayer, or get new race/new unit mods, Or even get Full conversion mods. (My favorite mod being Ultimate Apocalypse).Overall Dawn of War: Soulstorm is an excellent game and well wroth the price, If its a multiplayer expierence your after however, I recommend waiting for a sale and buying all the original Dawn of wars as it will unlock all the races for you in multiplayer and the other installments are well worth it as well.Story: 9.8/10Gameplay: 8.6/10Multiplayer: 9.2/10Audio: 8.2/10Visual: 7.6/10Final Score: 9.4/10			",133,18,3,18,7,2,12

												This game is worth its current cover price purely because of its status as the foundation game for, in my opinion, the mod project to end them all: Ultimate Apocalypse.Adding onto, rebalancing and overall completely improving the Dawn of War experience while also making it truer to the tabletop game through its addition of COUNTLESS canon units to play with, it is all but mandatory to try if you own this already great game. Please swing over to their moddb page here and consider doing so: http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-modAnyway, you have nothing to lose if you already own this game, check out this mod, among others, though UA is really a do-all end-all.

												A must have for any RTS player who likes building army's with basebuilding, this time u can even paint and logo your own army and banners.The resource collection and economy works different, u capture 3 diffrent type of points, most are requisition points, one power and one relic is all u need. most armys will get lets say their main income from requisition points except the necrons as far as i know, for them, power is the main income.power works different as well, it also works as income, so the more u build or the more power points u take the more income of '' power '' u get.u spend requisition and power on buildings and units / expanding units and on upgrades.and the last one, relic points are one for each player in the map, capturing this will grand access to lets say the superweapon unit and the elite units of your army.all points can be defended by building outpost on them and upgrading them, except power points, u need to build around them to defend them.so that is basicly how it works and its more easy then it sounds really.there are tons of races, units and buildings and tons of upgrades, when u think u are done and upgrade your main, everything has upgrades again.painting your own army and giving them logo's and creating your own banner is also unique to dawn of war.every race plays different in building and in army.all the expansions and the original have great campaings two of them have a risk like campaign map with some ingame cinematics.9/10 cant wait for dawn of war 3 wich will come out this year.

												Definitely a gem if you are a fan of Warhammer 40K and you love RTS games. What differs old Dawn of War series from Dawn of War II is that you are given the ability to construct buildings, and fight in battles of bigger scales. Each faction is unique and come with its own strategies, and you can find none shares the same one. If you can find fun discovering new things, exploring and develope strategies suitable to each faction, you will find a great deal of fun this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest Real Time Strategy games of all time, Dawn of War allowed players of the table top game to enjoy the Warhammer 40,000 universe without having to spend enough money that would support a decent cocaine habbit. Imersive gameplay, amazing campaigns and fun multiplayer makes it the most sought and played game of its type. Is it worth it? Yes. Do yourself a favour and buy this game or buy Dawn Of War and all its expansions.Plus Games Workshop is ♥♥♥♥ed at the moment with their stupid decisions they have been making.

												While not a table top clone of 40k, which they never are, the game is absolutely awesome. The best in the series for Dawn of War 1. Get some mods and expand on the game once you have mastered the vanilla portions. The graphics are dated of course but that shouldn't mean much. So All-In-All,  a good solid game that will provide hours of fun for the RTS and/or 40k fan.			",65,3,0,17,1,0,10

												If you havent played this game then you are missing out on a great experience. I reccomend finding a mod to allow you to zoom out a bit further while playing the vanilla game because the camera kind of hugs the dirt, the camera is my only problem with the game.The campaigne is great fun and will give you a challenge, the multiplayer is great as well and there is AI which arent too smart but when you are playing with friends, they will give you a run for your money.There is also alot of great mods to play with this game for the multiplayer,♥♥♥♥♥and Ultimate Apocalypse are some I have played which were alot of fun if you find that you get bored with the vanilla game.TL;DR Still the king of all DOW games, even to this day it remains untouched.

												As someone who is no stranger to the RTS genre, I'll admit, this one threw me for a loop at first!The most interesting thing here is the campaign.  Typically, your average RTS is either a survival game where you build up forces to withstand assault or it's a level-by-level progression, where you complete sequential missions.  This was the first time I actually felt like I was playing both at once.  The campaign mode of this game is odd, but in a good way; it's a refreshing way to bridge the two different styles of RTS into a unique gameplay system.Another interesting mechanic is the different races in the game.  Usually, different races will have a general build order that all follow the same way, or there are a few radically different races.  With this game, each race has a unique build style to explore!  The Imperial Guard have garrisonable buildings, the Eldar can Teleport, the Battle Sisters have Holy Relics... it's like each race is it's own unique game!(P.S.: If you're a bigtime RTS player like I am, and you're just now getting into this game, then I recommend starting as the Tau when you first play this game; their build order is more familiar to folks coming from a Starcraft or CiV background.)The only downside to this ""expansion""/game, I would say, is the lack of a story.  I mean, there is one, but it's very underplayed in this expansion.  It takes a bit of RP to really get into the story; not like Winter Assault or Dark Crusade, where there's a very obvious storyline to follow.  Still, this isn't really a big issue with the game itself; if you're already a big 40K fan, then you might not even notice it at all.All in all, a wonderful spin on the RTS games.  9/10.  Looking to get the other DoW1 titles, to experience the other stories in this game series.			",18,15,1,11,15,0,22

												There are a few issues that need to be highlighted regarding Soulstorm before I begin listing the positive aspects of this game. First off, the game has a lot of issues with loading, particularly with the campaign. Though I'll readily admit that my computer isn't a good one, the general concensus is that no game should keep you waiting as long as the Soulstorm Campaign does, so have a book or handheld system by your side if you intend to play the campaign. Secondly, as I'm sure a good chunk of you know, most of the voice acting for the Campaign mode is absolutely terrible, but this isn't a major issue as much as it is a gripe (most of the issues regarding the game come from the campaign).Now, on to the postives.This expansion adds two new factions to play as, the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar, both of which are welcome additions to the game. Both bring new strategies to the table, as well as giving you a better look at the 40k universe (I say this because Dawn of War is most people's gateway to Warhammer 40,000). The gameplay is still solid (though of course balance is still a major issue), because few expansion packs can really mess up gameplay.And last but not least, the real reason you should purchase this game: The mods.There are dozens of amazing mods for Soulstorm, from ambitious gameplay overhauls like Titanium Wars and Ultimate Apocalypse, to new factions (complete with voice acting) like the Armageddon Steel Legion and Tyranids. If you're not sure about getting Soulstorm, do it for the mods.			",144,17,3,23,10,1,23

												This is a terrible expansion. It has terrible voice acting, a terrible campaign that takes warhammer 40k logic or any real logic period and just stomps on it with a dreadnought, and the 2 new races are abysmal to play - not to mention the new flying units are buggy and overpowered/underpowered/unbalanced in general.So why am I recommending this?MODS. MODS MODS MODS MODS MODS. You throw some mods into this game, many of which are only compatible with it (Ultimate apocolypse for example) and what you have is one of the greatest RTS games of all time, taking everything that made the original DoW games great and taking it to a whole other level. These mods can fix the balance that this expansion totalled, add races we actually WANTED to see, make LEGIT improvements, and more. If you buy this game, you HAVE to get the mods for it - as a base expansion you will not only be disappointed, but if you are a warhammer 40k fan or are expecting anything decent out of the campaign or the new races, you will be more than likely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to high hell.Buy this. For the mods. Thats it.			",280,35,7,24,85,3,94

												My experience with Dawn of War: Soulstorm was great, and I highly suggest that you play it. However, there is the terrible campaign with dialogue that rivals ""The Room""'s entire script. The 2 new races were interesting enough, and the whole package was decent. This is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I suggest that you pick it up.Rating 7-10			",123,11,3,20,23,1,37

												Overall I really like this game, however if there is one thing I do have a problem with it is the balance. some factions (races, whatever) are stronger than others, or at least have a extremly powerful and cheap way to win. There are also some which are weaker than adverage and are always lurking when you decide to random. To show my point better i will show for each faction a cheap or unbalanced tactic (or if a faction does not have one, the best you can do) This is mainly from tactics I or my friends have used that we all agree are pretty broken. (list is in random order)Chaos: get 2 to 3 raptor squads early game, this is both very effective at rush defence (or a rush) but it is also particuarly effective against factions the rely heavily on ranged unitsOrks: get 2 or 3 slugga boyz right away and max them out as much as you can (do not wait to build a waagh tower) then rush. You however can and should build a waagh tower while you rush to give you more squad members.  Almost gauranteed to work except against chaos or if they have prepared for the rush.Necrons: Making an entire army out of flayed ones. They will almost instantly break the enemy's morale and they also do some insane melee damage. (be careful though they are slow and easily outmicroed)Eldar: Just don't play them, they are the worst race in the game.Sisters of Battle: they are ok, me and my friends have not found an op tactic for them though.  just build a lot of battle sister squads early game and don't build seraphim squads (not enough damage to effectivly harass)Imperial guard: They do not really have and overpowered tactic however if you don't want to die make sure you can defend against large amounts of melee units as they suck in melee. Also understand that they are very expendable.Dark Eldar: A gigantic improvement over the normal Eldar, they have an extremely powerful melee vehicle called the Talos, this thing will destroy infantry and unless they have anti tank is a very big threat.Space marines: for the most part not overpowered, however I did see a pretty broken tactic once. my friend rushed to dreadnaugnts and sent and attack. that was not the problem though. He had researched an ability that allowed him to drop down troops in a drop pod. he kept sending dreadnaught after dreadnaught and my army was not able to kill them in time before he sent in another one (he was also sending in terminator squads) I had 3 to 4 full squads of imperial guard with grenade launchers firing at them and workers repairing my buildings but I eventually lost to sheer spam.Tau: get 1 to 2 kroot and them spam fire warriors in the back. Having done this myself I watched as entire squads were obliterated in seconds. However the one thing that does hinder you is that their units are very expensive and require good map control to get the resources to really get the ball rolling.As you can see there are balance issues but it is still a fun game to play with some friends.If this review was comepletly terrible keep in mind it is my first one.

												Dawn of War Soulstorm is the final piece of the Dawn of War 1 ""series."" It added 2 factions (Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle) and 1 new unit for each race. The comparisons to Dark Crusade are inevitable so let's compare and contrast. Dark Crusade's persistant bases give you a reason to prolong a match so as to build up a good base for the next fight. Unfortunately, it also means that defenses can be insurmountable creating a World War 1 like stalemate. This was done away with in Soulstorm which created much shorter more offensive gameplay. Other complaints I have heard is in regards to the voice acting as opposed to Dark Crusade. Well, actually, this is true. There is significantly reduced dialogue in this one compared to Dark Crusade. Which is a genuine shame considering how much I enjoyed the back-and-forth of the two commanders as I assaulted a stronghold.Would I recommend it though? Short answer. Yes, just look at my time played. Of course this game is worth the money, and then some. If you need a great RTS or love Warhammer 40K, grab this game. Just do it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite RTS of all time. Played Dark Crusade over years and Soulstorm is as good. But you have to like the 2 new races.The balance is a bit off hand compared to StarCraft. But the matches are fast and intense and much fun and bring the sweat to your forehead. The Animations like the little finishing moves for every unit are great to the present day and blew my mind back in 2004. So the battles are bloody and ruthless as it should be for 40k game. All in all: Relic did a great job in conveying the universe into a RTS game. Also are the online matches fast and intense and the 9 diffrent races bring a great variety and lots of strategies to experiment with. Sadly the balance is a bit off in online battles.Strongly recommended if you like RTS.			",116,18,2,27,10,0,17

												Honestly I don't know where to start, I love this god damn game so much. It brought me into the 40k universe, and that has become a huge part of my life now, this game is good without mods, but with them, it becomes so much more.  The feel of this game brings back older RTS games, but it adds the Warhammer aspect so well. If you havent got into Warhammer and you think you will, this game is definately one you should start off with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick tutorial on how to enjoy the game playing multiplayer :1 ( /1 ) - Acquire visceral phobia of RussiaAll russian players in this game are either cheaters, either tryhards to the point you'll have absolutely NO fun playing the game. Exploiting bugs and cancer strats, sending their friends in your team so that you play 1v2 / 2v3 etc, there is absolutely no limit to the things they'll do to win. In a 2008 W40k game.C'mon Dmitri, Starcraft isn't that expensive if you want to play in a competitive RTS.Also, there's a 50% chance that if you have Dmitri in your lobby, the game won't launch at all because of the cyrillic badges.tl;dr : If it speaks russian or dont speak at all, kick it. If it wants Alvarus or Mortalis maps, kick it. If it picks Tau or Eldar, kick it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Soulstorm is the final and in my opinion, best expansion for the critically acclaimed Dawn Of War I franchise that got unfortunately hounded by reviewers at launch, but was greatly enhanced by both official patches and mods that made this game one of the most famous and game-changing RTS's out there.+ Standalone expansion that adds the fanatical sisters of battle, with a a wide array of artillery and faith based attacks, and the sadistic, twisted dark eldar, who are nothing like the original Eldar faction and are the epitome of the term glass cannon with the highest damage in the game, but also the worst health I've ever seen.+ Balanced older factions making it a better experience for all+ Those that own Soulstorm do not need any other part of DOW I to play with others who own the franchise (assuming they too own atleast Soulstorm) but you are restricted from the factions added in other expansions giving you access to only 2 of the 9+ The meta-campaign returns giving you the ability to fight in the 9-way war for Kaurava.+ Airforce based units are added making fighter jets available to all (except the Necron, but they get a spell that hijacks vehicles permenantly now) adding a new level of diversity to the combat as they dont follow the same movement restrictions as ground troops.+The game can be further enhanced with the legendary Ultimate Apocalypse mod adding new balance changes, better graphics, units, and redoes every faction from the ground up making them as the Codex Astartes (basically lore for the universe for the  heretics  those unfamiliar with the lore reading this ) states making it one of the greatest mods for any game ever. That is a fact, opinions do not matter in the 40th millenia.- The ai is still kinda wonky on lower difficulties and will not always utilize their best features on higher ones. For example, the Eldar, who are meant to be a teleportation based army with weak hit-and-run style units, will instead opt for buildig multiple unupgraded guardian (rifleman) squads and rush you by the two minute mark. This works well if you didnt build a turret which mows them down violently, but it still doesn't fit with how that faction was meant to work. This can be fixed with mods however.-Due to age, and a community divided over mods, finding people to play with isn't always easy. If you have friends into RTS games however, this game is a god(emperor)send.-The new aerial units take a lot of damage from even basic infantry making them not very viable in many instances. So if your looking for some high end combined arms assault, all your gonna get is some quality infantry and armored vehicles fighting as dead pilots drop down.-The controversial commander units are back, though not as dangerous as they are in the second game as they are still very much killable by even the weaker units. In my opinion, they aren't too much of an issue and as a concept add to the game, though balance is a tad bit skewed as some armies get their primary and best commanders at the beginning like the Space/Chaos marines and dark eldar when others have to wait for a base upgrade or other enhancement. I feel that these guys have a bit too much early game infantry harassment but by the end is no issue.-A full-fleged story based campaign is still absent like in Dark Crusade but the new campaign format included in the two allows you to play as your favorite faction instead of either the Space marines in the base game, or 1-2 missions for each in the Winter Assault. In conclusion, the game still holds up and is still fantastic to play in both standard and the Ultimate Apocalypse mod. Balance still isn't perfect, but the more you play you should be able to master and hold up as any faction making it one of the most biggest and greatest RTS games out there.			",232,28,1,28,24,3,34

												EDIT: Seeing as Sega is now involved with this game and has started up the DoW servers once again making online play much easier over Steam, this game is worth all the more. GET IT!!Yes.Yes, yes, yes.Note that the Steam game time does not give my actual game time credit. I had this game way before I had Steam, and I've probably spent 250+ hours on it.For all you RTS junkies, THQ, Relic and Games Workshop created this. This is by far the best RTS game i've ever played (mostly gameplay wise). The story might not be as thrilling or entertaining as other RTS games, but who plays RTS games for the cutscenes?Dawn of War (all of them, but Soulstorm is more worth getting as it has all the races) is definitely the best RTS game i've played, bringing in new aspects of gaining resources and building armies that are absolutely great. Maps are awesome and designed very well, and the units and special abilities will satisfy you greatly. Dawn of War's races can vary very much, with some races such as the Necrons or Dark Eldar having special aspects that are completely alien compared to the other 7 races, so it has a good choice of the style of play that will keep you entertained for hours. After playing this game for long enough, you'll find yourself quoting the phrases the units say all the time - by far the best being ""WIIIIITNEEEESSS EEYOUR DOOOOOOOMMMMMEE!!!""Very good game, must buy!

												While perhaps not as highly regarded as Dark Crusade by some, DOW: Soulstorm creates an enjoyable RTS experence.  Each of the races has a different feel and lends itself to different types of strategy and yet each race also has the ability to overcome its weaknesses.  This extension of DOW adds flying units (except Nekrons) and two new races, of which I have found the Sisters of Battle particuarly fun tio play.  The flying units are nice but not a real powerhouse of the game.  On the downside, the map is a tad less dynamic than DC--I feel its predecessor had more options in its pathing, but the races balance better in Soulstorm.  The difficulty levels also offer greatly different game experiences.  The campaign is nice for an extended play, especially if you change races it can be like a new game.  The skirmish mode also allows for some quick, fun play.  The AI is ok--you might find yourself able to begin overunning the map in campaign mode once you have won a few victories in a row at times.  Overall, I recommend this game for its replayability and various levels of alien color.			",51,14,0,17,3,0,30

												This game is one of the best I have ever played! The game is a master peace, and I have always known this game. It has been with me for a very long time. It has a great community, game play, and it has great mods. I some how, have no problems with this game, I spent a hour on this. Trying to find one thing wrong with this game. I could not find it! That leads my final verdict to be a 10/10! GREAT GAME! GET IS NOW! ""For it is a poor sheperd how blames his fall on is sheep!"" -Demon Prince			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Favorite Dawn of War of all time! I highly advise getting this one! The only down side to this game is the horrid path finder AI. if you have an army with a big and slow unit they will try to walk faster behind it and get stuck, often leaving some members to go ahead, they are not smart enough to go around.

												I would really recommend this game to anyone who loves a good base builder RTS and especially if you enjoy Warhammer 40K. The ability to spam an army of Orks and sweep across the battlefield in a big green wave is exactly what Warhammer is all about! The only dissappointing thing about this game from a Warhammer point of view is the absence of certain units from the game such as the Chaos Land Raider. This is a problem that is easily fixed as there are many mods available for this game which make it much closer to the Warhammer 40K codexes in terms of the units available and the options each unit can take.

												I'm a big fan of the Dawn of War francise.  I'll admit that I prefer Dark Crusader over this as the addition of flying units didn't work very well and the writers kinda messed up on the campaign, but the modding community is actually pretty good!  The Titanium Wars mod actually takes away the flyers and adds a lot of new units making the game very difficult and refreshed the entire campaign as the new units really bring a new experience.  I think that any person that enjoys the RTS genre would enjoy this game regardless of it's sometimes silly pathing.			",47,3,3,13,2,0,29

												Awesome fun time to play with/against friends. More the reason to play multiplayer as the ingame AI and pathing mechanics are quite buggy and always lead to frustrating moments.As for balancing issues, well some races do get overwhelming advantages over others, and vice versa for disadvantages. But that also depends on individual skill levels and playstyle, and most importantly, the understanding of how each race and their mechanics work.			",159,3,4,6,4,0,22

												this game is unbelievably fun. With the balancing and the system with every thing was amazing. I felt that i was never bored, as there were many ways to have fun and have many maps to play. Im not such a huge stratigic type of play but this one was a killer. I just could not recomend this game enough. As with this game, unfortunatley the only way to get other factions is to by more of their games. Which sucks, but no matter what they are well worth it. And the reason why i mainly use soulstorm is the design and the campaign. Im happy they made this a thing.			",113,13,1,5,15,0,4

												Excellent game.Played it a lot many years ago. I played it competitve in 1on1, clan wars and esl and just for fun. What I like the most is that you have to focus on many things, eco management, base building and teching, tactics and unit micromanagement. The combat system with ranged and melee, knockback and stunning is very good as well.Plus you have 9 factions wich play very unique and are still perfectly balanced.I wished relic would have all these good things in COH2 as well.

												   I've been playing this game for ages, longer than I've had Steam, and I still come back to it nearly every week. Obviously, this game isn't nearly as interesting for people who don't know the 40k universe as it is to fans of it, but it is still a very enjoyable game with lots of replayability, and is a solid game with or without the 40k setting.    The replayability only really comes from the skirmish and multiplayer, as I find the campaign to be a bit repetitive and quite franky not very interesting. Plus, while there is a good selection of units in this installment in the series, I always find the there is always a couple of units for every race that I seldom use unless I specifically work them into my strategy. My only other real complaint is that there is sometimes annoying pathing issues with units moving in a large group, and if you are playing with AI it can become quite tedious.    Other than that, i absolutely love these games, mainly due to the awesome unit models and animations etc. The army painter is also a really nice feature that allows you to create your own armies or recreate known ones from the 40k universe (to some degree - it is a bit simple for some designs). The aesthetic and overall art style ties in very well with the setting aswell, including all the viscera and crater holes that are left behind from bloody combat. The maps are also varied and are good sizes for the most part. The game itself also makes you feel like your part of the battle, and the strategic point based gameplay is a nice spin on traditional RTS.   Overall, it's a solid game with some fun features, but it is the setting and the aesthetic that keeps me playing, probably because I am a big fan of the 40k universe. So to conclude, if you are into 40k, it is a very worthwhile purchase, but if you aren't... eh, I'd still buy the game.			",63,10,0,17,12,0,30

												When a young man is told that ""A moment of laxity spawns a lifetime of heresy"" he is not the same ever again. It happened to me as well, and Warhammer 40 000 is still my favorite ""commercial"" fantasy world. It seems unreal yet plausible, like a funny nightmare perhaps. Relic has captured the spirit of 40K perfectly, and the games are great on their own as well. This is the fourth and final part of Dawn of War 1, and Relic gave the design duties to Iron Lore. It shows, for the campaign is an inferior repetition of Dark Crusade, and the writing is generic at best. Yet the original gameplay is beyond all criticism, and the two new armies are realized very well. There are a total of nine factions, and all are worth attention and playtime. Iron Lore folded and Soulstorm patch cycle stopped. There is a Maktaka Bugfix Mod, which is absolutely essential. It should work with Steam as well.			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War - Soulstorm is a great game for laughs, especially if you are a 40k fanboy. It's also a great game for killing Xenos and burning heretics. Tactical play is needed in the game for winning and getting use to the controls are pretty hard. A very fun game with low graphics for a cheap price. The gameplay is very fun with swarms of Space Marines charging into other waste lands. It has hours of unlimited fun but it does get a bit boring after playing 6 hours a day. Soulstorm is a gigantic mod with lots of maps. I recommend it for you fanboys who hate orks XD8/10Chop2015			",96,9,2,7,4,2,15

(Eldar (Both Flavors)). The campaign, although over planets, plays pretty much in the same order1. 1 or two territories2. Stonghold3. More land4. Webway mission5. Webway mission (again)RepeatAlso in between prepare to defend the same map over and over again, with no perma build system.Overall, a good expansion			",43,5,1,0,4,0,11

												In the Grim Darkness of the future there is only War. Soulstorm is an excellent expansion of the series, Dawn of War. I highly recomend the series, as it can lead to addicting hours of play, alone or with friends. It is friendly with many computers of all ages, and there are good mods that can extend how much you play this game. (Ultimate Apocolypse is my favorite mod, as it is more fluff friendly.) Recomended for those new to the universe and those who are veterans in the galaxy of war. Fight in His Glorious name, the God-Emperor of Mankind, or for the Ruinious Powers of Chaos, or even perhaps in the name of the Xenos who fight for their own ends. You decide, and you shall carve into history.     The story of the series is wonderful in itself, although not as grand or as well told as the first or Winter Assault. Dark Crusade and Soulstorm non the less allow for a fun twist of domination for the sector. They tie in slightly with the Dawn of War II series, but are not necasary for DoW II. (Note: Multiplayer comes with its own race from each game. GotY/Gold gives Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and Chaos. Winter Assault grants the Imperial Guard. Dark Crusade allows for Tau and Necrons. Soulstorm itself grants the zealotous, the Sisters of Battle, and the dreaded Dark Eldar. Alone in Skirmish *should* allow you to play as any race, however.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my favorite game. The graphics are maybe not the best but the game itself is amazing!I don't think you should only buy Soulstorm. Buy all the other Warhammer 40k to get the full experience. I've played the campaigns in every 40k and I loved them. If you don't like the campaigns I would get soulstorm because it has more factions and the best graphics. So soulstorm is best for multiplayerI will always love this game. It's really fun to play with friends or against them. You could also try the ultimate apocalypse mod. Which adds alot to the experience.I rate this game 10/10 because I have no negative thoughts about this game. Maybe the graphics but who cares? ",42,1,0,4,4,0,20

												Yes there are cons about this. You do have to buy all 4 games to get all of the races, and I get it, that is annoying. However, the modding community for this game is great, and there is one in particular that I would like to talk about. Ultimate Apcolypse mod is a fan made mod that adds the Tryanids, better game settings, (it also has a map pack that increases the zoom distance and increases visibility when you zoom out) it is still getting updated, recently there had been 2 more custom races added: The Inquisition with the totally badass Grey Knights (know as Daemonhunters in game), and Chaos Daemons, not to forget the improvements on all other races with new units and textures/models. The creators of the mod are great at what they've done and I think that they are one of the main reasons why I love Warhammer so much, so props to them. If you want the mod, here is a link to their download page (virus free btw):http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod/downloadsPlease note that the game still has desync and desync errors, and it requires a more resources to not have lag. (however if you have it set so that you have massive battles with a population cap over 100, you will probably get at bit of lag, especially since the mod is basically a massive overhaul of the original. The mod itself is more than 10GB, but it is really worth it, trust me.			",118,5,0,7,10,1,26

												This is a game that has been in my library for a long time and always remains installed.  The games are quick and it has such tremendous replay value with all of the different races stacked in from the other games.  Resources are simple as well.  If you like to dive into the action instead of sending peons off to gather stuff then this is the game for you!  It's easier to maintain fights a long way from your base as well because each squad replenishes their units directly instead of having to wait for reinforcements to trudge all the way across the map.  To top it off, the Army Painter is great fun and lets you really customize and save the look of different armies.  I definitely recommend this game.			",81,19,0,28,9,0,14

												A fantastic game as an expansion to the original dawn of war and also the base game to an amazing mod called Ultimate Apocalypse that adds a huge amount of lore related units and building and the mod can even be played with others the only downside is with the mod you can't play the campaign, that isn't much of an annoyance though because unfortunatly compared to the original dawn of war and its 2 other expansions this campaign isn't much to behold all in all i give this game a 9/10.

												I think this game is awesom with two more factions than there were in Dark Crusade but i don´t personally like all the ´´Take And Hold´´ maps but it is stil a pretty awesome game. All-in-all an awesome game that challenges your wits as much as your mental capability to handel imense sress (i´m talking about the TAH (Take And Hold) maps as when you only have 5 minutes to capture at least 2-3 Critical locations that of wich is teally annoying at best100/5.  would totally play again (still is)i stronly recommend using the ´´No Limit Mod SS´´ it makes the exprience so much more than the usual RTS			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In the Grim Darkness of the future there is only War. Soulstorm is an excellent expansion of the series, Dawn of War. I highly recomend the series, as it can lead to addicting hours of play, alone or with friends. It is friendly with many computers of all ages, and there are good mods that can extend how much you play this game. (Ultimate Apocolypse is my favorite mod, as it is more fluff friendly.) Recomended for those new to the universe and those who are veterans in the galaxy of war. Fight in His Glorious name, the God-Emperor of Mankind, or for the Ruinious Powers of Chaos, or even perhaps in the name of the Xenos who fight for their own ends. You decide, and you shall carve into history.     The story of the series is wonderful in itself, although not as grand or as well told as the first or Winter Assault. Dark Crusade and Soulstorm non the less allow for a fun twist of domination for the sector. They tie in slightly with the Dawn of War II series, but are not necasary for DoW II. (Note: Multiplayer comes with its own race from each game. GotY/Gold gives Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and Chaos. Winter Assault grants the Imperial Guard. Dark Crusade allows for Tau and Necrons. Soulstorm itself grants the zealotous, the Sisters of Battle, and the dreaded Dark Eldar. Alone in Skirmish *should* allow you to play as any race, however.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients: 1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs3 tablespoons sugar3 tablespoons melted butter40 ounces softened cream cheese1 cup sugar3 tablespoons flour1 tablespoon vanilla1 cup sour cream4 eggsDirections:For The base:.If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat. ",54,4,0,2,9,2,6

												As it has all of the factions, this should be considered the strongest of the Dawn of War 1 installments. Its great for both fans of 40k or for newcomers (or those too poor to buy far too expensive sets)While some of the fighting gets tedious, there are few other flaws wih Dawn of War: Soulstorm. Its great for creating your own story in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Are you a dishourned space marine captain fighting to regain his peers respect? A vengeful Eldar leader hoping to avenge their kin? Or a human traitor who only wishes for the dark gods to rule the universe? All of these and more are available.+Great storytelling from your own perspective.+Nice customisation options+Some interesting and rare factions like Sisters of Battle+Excellent battles during the middle of a battle+Nice, interesting battle play style+You can turn a chaos general into Satan+Half of the factions seem to be drug addicts (Chaos, Eldar, Dark Eldar)/Outdated graphics, good for the original-No tyranids (still)-Tedious gameplay towards the endScore: 7/10 - Good			",63,2,0,3,2,0,7

												More of the last one, however instead of it being one planet (or one side of the planet) you have 4 planets and 3 moons to conquer, making things in the campaign much longer. You can no longer keep buildings in areas you conquered like the last game, unless  you have the foward basses ability. you can steal abilities off other races when you defeat them which gives you great boons and in this one two new groups appear. The sisters of combat and the Dark Eldar. This makes it a huge campaign and a lot of choice for people who want to play multiplayer and more fun than Dark Crusade.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												(Reviews of mine posted on the expansions are the exact same as this one)Enjoy playing a game that stands tall and proud even now. Enjoy playing a game that has virtually no balance problems. Enjoy playing a game with 9 different races that somehow all play the same, something that Starcraft 2 Heart of The Swarm currently is beginning to fail at.Enjoy playing a game where each race has a super weapon that is literally a giant unit from a giant tank, to a large, fat pyramid-ish cube with a giant laser beam, or even a big pig...thing with lasers on it's head, bigger than the swimming pool you went to last month.Trust me... these Super Weapons put Command and Conquer's Super Weapons at the kiddie table, they make them look like pea shooters almost. Oh... what's that? One is an energy field that makes all tanks and vehicles invulnerable for a short time? One of them is an ion blast fired from a sattelite in space or something? One of them is a nuke?Only the Nuke super weapon stands up to any of these.The game works off of unlimited resources known as Requisition and Power. Power, you make generators to make, and Requisition is gained from taking and holding points throughout a map. Both can be upgraded in a different way to produce more resources faster.Anyonewho is a fan of strategy games who has NOT played this one is just simply missing out.This game is the closest anyone will ever get to a seemingly perfect game in it's own rights, and to add to it, it's got wonderful voiceacting, awesome soundtracks and rather impressive visuals for it's time, all of which stands just aswell today.Hardcore RTS fans can agree that if you are a HUGE fan of the Real-Time Strategy Game, you owe it to yourself to try this.The game has 3 expansions, the first one adds The Imperial Gaurd, the second adds the Tau and Necrons, and the thirds adds the Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar.All 3 add onto the game and simply make it one of the best if not the best RTS in existence so far.Also only Soulstorm has much of an actual multiplayer, because people only play it, so if multiplayer is what you're looking for... well try out the skirmish mode, and if you like this, get the 3 expansions and join us in the crusade to kill eachother!This game is easily an 8/10, it's simply gaming bliss.

												I put hundreds of hours into this game before I had it on steam.  It is one of the best RTS games out there.  The other expansions and base game are good too, but this is the last of them so it includes the most.  Play as the Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Sisters of Battle, Tau, Eldar, Necrons, Orks, or Dark Eldar.  Build a massive army, capture points, and take on the enemy in PVP, the campaign, or skirmish mode against bots.  Really an amazing game.  I would like to recommend another game within this review that is not on Steam.  The Battle For Middle Earth II, along with it's expansion The Rise of the Witch-King.  Really excellent games.

												This game is amazing, although there are some setbacks. Some of the setbacks include; same graphics, more to upgrade (could be considered a pro or a con), no Daemon Hunters, no Tyrannids, no Inquistion (more races could be listed), and the campaign feels exactly like Dark Crusade. Although there are a lot of cons, two of the better things about this game are; constant force to replay the game and the gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before reading the fact I recommend the game, keep in mind that the game is better with mods which is what really makes it worth buying and replaying. Overall hours played if I count the time before I finally decided to re-purchase it via Steam is about 1.5k hours as this was the most played strategy game in my collection back in the day.Vanilla Review:Dawn of War Soulstorm has many, many unfinished abilities and units which take away from the overall effect of multiplayer and campaign abilities. While in itself it is still a good title and a replayable campaign for AI grinding is still fun, if Relic/THQ had actually finished their project, it would of been a lot better.The Campaign is basically a repeat of Dark Crusade but you got Tau and Sisters of Battle now which isn't really that much. Overall balancing is okay but there is a lot left to be desired such as knockback spam being hard to counter or defend against and special weapons troopers always being the first to die even if they're in the back of the squad being attacked.The vanilla version also does a very poor job at vehicle implementation particularly with aircraft as they're glorified glass cannons in some cases (Orks) and useless in almsot all accords (Imperial Guard).  Limiting special units in most cases where in Dark Crusade you could have more is a double edged sword and the limits should of been raised. Having the ability to only create one elite troop unit compared to three back in Dark Crusade is a major debuff in my opinion and overall takes away from the fighting experience as most of them are very weak to begin with.The developers have also neglected balancing between every race. Races such as the Orks and Tau are extremely powerful against most other factions and in some cases you can't even win if it's against a competent player or the AI on the highest difficulty such as Orks vs Imperial Guard....you can't even win in a balanced fight particularly if it's 3v3 or 4v4 due to the Invulnerability spam on Ork units. Now if you do Orks vs Space Marines or even Eldar, it's a lot easier because the races aren't glass cannons. Imperial Guard it seems has been mostly balanced from a 1v1 stand point and team fight with non-Imperial Guard races which is a shame because they should be able to do well in team fights with other Guard players but in almost every instance, that is not the case. Sisters of Battle are extremely strong in all stages of the game and honestly minus the fact they're basically infantry only, can beat almost every faction in a 1v2 instance. Tau are glorified glass cannons and with the length of their tech tree, most games end before you can even begin to put the hurt on the enemy in a 1v1. Their entire tech tree is based off long team fights where they really shine and often end up losing in early game fights on small maps due to their higher maintenance costs and the lack of defenses. Eldar/Dark Eldar and SM/CSM have changed very little and are good at all stages, no reall balancing needed. Necrons, very very good late stages but absolutely get massacured early game in even fights. Not even balanced in a 1v1 perspective or even 2v2, they show the least amount of balancing from the developers and honestly only shine on large maps where you can't get rushed at one minute into the game.Overall Score: 7/10Campaign 5/10Multiplayer 8/10Game Mechanics 8/10Replay Value 10/10Balacning 6/10Ultimate Apocalypse Review:This is the way the game should be played IF your computer is capable of supporting it. It expands upon the vanilla build and releases several more functions that make the game more enjoyable in addition to implementing several functions that were left unfinished such as additional units and abilities.The mod also implements the Tyranids and Inquisition (WIP) for play in addition to a few new maps but overall is a massive rebalancing project that is catered as well towards Super Heavy battles. Trust me, if you want a tank war, this is the mod for you especially if you play Imperial Guard. It embraces the doctrine of ""We have a tank for that too!""The ability for all races to now build defensive turrets and in some cases walls/barricades is an added bonus on smaller maps to help prevent rushing and the ability to further upgrade defensive buildings and resources helps solve the problem of resource stagnation in most games making it much easier to continue playing late game even if you end up losing your armies rapidly.The mod also rebalances aircraft which in the Vanilla version were a joke and a waste of resources. In addition to the mod expanding both the capabilities of each race, it also drastically increases the scale of destruction and carnage you can witness. The mod is still a WIP which is good because it is constantly rebalanced and a few new races are being implemented.Ultimate Apoclaypse Link: http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-modOverall Score 9/10Balancing 8/10Game Mechanics 10/10Campaign 10/10Replay Value 10/10Multiplayer 9/10			",140,3,0,18,10,2,41

												It has Force Commander Boreale, 40,000/10!!!!Alright This game has many merits to stand on beyond an Astartes Commander with a speech problem.The game uses Dark Crusade's formula of Risk-ish province attack, defense and Commander upgrades for the space between skirmish battles, with more important Faction Strongholds and bonus missions being spread about the map. The difference? Instead of just being a landmass, the battle map is an ENTIRE DAMN SOLAR SYSTEM.The Expansion also adds two new Factions. Namely the Dark Eldar (Fallen Eldar slavers) and the SIsters of battles (Space Nuns with power armour). Both of these new factions have their quirks, with the Dark Eldar gaining a reasource for their special abilites from haresting their foes Corpses, and the Sisters Gaining both power and faith the more of a specific building you have.However, removeing those new races the expansion is basicly the same as dark crusade but with two new races and over many planets instead of just one. The game only has one other merit of note. That being the new unit's Voice workIT IS SO BAD AND I LOVE IT. As i mentioned at the start of this review, the Space Marine Boreale's voice actor has a bit of an accent with makes his speech so damn funny (Bhatal Bruvas, Spess Marhens, Steal Rein!). The game also spawned Chaos Lord Carron, as-well his meme worthy response to the space marines use of Rhino armoured transports, below is a transcript.""Look! RHINOS *Inhale* RHINOS!

												Dawn of War® - Soulstorm is a game I love, hate, and love to hate - I just can't make heads or tails of it. The gameplay is both really good and really terrible.What makes it good is the diversity available - this is the first strategy game I've ever played that has a staggering count of NINE playable races, but what counters that is that they're all extremely complex and hard to understand. The actual gameplay of resource points and what not, though, is kind of puzzling, and I would have honestly preferred to just stay with the traditional resource gathering. In many ways, it sort of reminds me of Tiberian Twilight; the less said about that game the better.So since Steam forces me with a ""black or white"" option with ""yes or no"", I'll recommend this game with a ""yes"", though it's probably not for everybody.

												While the base game is amazing and hilariously fun, do yourself a favor and download the Ultimate Apocalypse mod.

												I love Warhammer 40,000 Dawn Of War.This game is Superior to many RTS games even in todays standards and never fails to provide edge of the seat action and battles that keep you entertained time and again. It is very content rich and has very worthwhile DLC and is a steal in the sale which it has a very low price.Dawn Of War is a base building RTS that offers many building and tech options to unlock more units and better upgrades or better defences. You also have to manage various resources such as energy to build these things which can be very hard.I found the story to be very lackluster and i would expect and want more from this. It is basically an excuse for the races to fight eachother for no reason. It is played in a risk based grid in a sector but does have meaningful deecisions such as where to defend or put various armies.The Good:There are nine different races with each having a way of playing and have different units tactics and tech to choose from. This increases replayability and makes sure there is a race for everyone.A wide variety of customization from colors and loooks and the army name making each army unique to the player and gives personality.A wide variety of units building tactics and tech for each faction.Multiplayer still has a large communit and singleplayer skirmish can be a challenge with over 100 maps with various terrian.The Bad:Story SUCKSCannot personalize what they can wear.AI can be studip at times but is generally good.It was very hard to find fault with the game as it is just that good and i advise you get the game NOW!!!!

												Another great real time strategy game from the dawn of war series. This one is identical to the dark crusade one, but the map is now played over multiple planets which makes the strategy part a bit more complex, which is fun!Also they got new factions like the battle sisters which are quite dangerous. They are holy space marines. Their commander and 2nd commander are quite dangerous with their big aoe. Especially the 2nd commander.If you loved dark crusade, you will love this one too. The only thing i prefered in dark crusade is that it had only 1 resource while this one has the typical 2 ressources: energy and metal. This makes it a bit harder to jungle the two while kicking♥♥♥♥♥in the map.			",76,10,0,33,37,0,41

												This used to be a great game, until Sega got a hold of it and ruined it. I'd happily recommend this game if the LAN option was once again added. However this is likely not going to occur because Sega, and by extension Relic, are being greedy and overprotective over a decade old franchise. The only thing that removing the LAN option does is encourage people to pirate versions of the game prior to the THQ collapse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If I could give neutral reviews this game would probably get one. Good- Honor Guards - Unlock wargear - Two new races Bad- Maps no longer save: If you had to defend a province in 'Dark Crusade' you would start exactly where you had left off, with all the buildings you built and all the listening posts you had claimed. Now a ""defense mission"" is the same as playing a skirmish map. - No spaceport: Conquering the spaceport in 'Dark Crusade' allowed you to attack anywhere on the map and pick up what bonus/honor guard you wanted to go for first. Now you'll have to use ""old portals"" which takes much longer to move around and also allows the enemy to attack your province, forcing you to play another ""skirmish map""[TL;DR]If you're looking for an expansion pack, go for 'Dark Crusade' first and pick up 'Soulstorm' when it's on a sale. This game certainly doesn't deserve all the hate it gets, but it feels like a downgrade after DC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In DC, a level 2 area consisted of a single base, barracks only, and a few enemy squads with no additional troops. In this version, a lvl 2 area is three tier 3 enemy bases, a never ending stream of dreadnaughts, constant attacks from 4+ squads of fully geared infantry and relic summons every time you fend off an attack. It's so difficult it's not enjoyable anymore. I wish the difficulty  was balanced like it is in DC.			",28,6,0,3,4,0,8

												I would really like to recommend this game, it is by far the  best Dawn of War game. Sadly, my experience would suggest otherwise. I cannot beat the campaign simply because after each main base or settlement (whatever you want to call it) crashes infinitely. Meaning, that I cannot truly beat the game, even if I desired so.  This call was on a 50/50, for the negative recommendation, as the base game (along with  a mod that fixed the camera height)  IS my favorite Dawn of War game.This game feels dated as far as some of the mechanics and graphics go. It is all forgiven with the simply yet complex styled gameplay that only the original Dawn of War series could bring.TL:DR Game breaking bug prevents from experiencing all Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War® - Soulstorm has to offer. Despite these bugs, it is a good game.			",151,9,3,12,7,0,23

												as a big fan of warhammer dawn of war i wanted to try soulstorm after buying dark crusade on amazon, comparing the two i was bitterly dissapointed with soulstorm, the only new units it adds to the dark crusade armies were unimpressive aircraft units which to be frank were more like skimmers that could jump over impassable terrain, i wasnt impressed with the two new factions either, to be fair i only tried the sisters of battle which seemed a bit unorthadox to the authenticity of the 4Ok universe, alongside this there was no difference to any other data when it came to existing units there were the same unit pictures and descriptions, to further show the indefferences from the two games the leaders of each existing factions where not much different to there predeccesors infact they were more ripoffs if youd like, in conclusion dont make the mistajke i made when you get complacent with dark crusade ~amazing game by the way~ and think that soulstorm would refresh your dawn of war experiance.. it doesnt,			",9,0,0,1,1,0,3

												Thank god they finally got around to adding some boobs to the Space Marines. This franchise was one giant testosterone injection (Eldar exempted, of course) and the addition of some females makes the experience as a whole much, much better. And by better I mean breasts. It's not just mammaries, though: this standalone expansion also adds a new, very bad campaign, as if to send the message that women ruin everything. Gazongas + misogynism isn't really a groundbreaking theme in video games, but it's an underrepresented one in the RTS genre, so Soulstorm really fills a void that has really only been addressed by the Red Alert series. I award this game 5 out of 5 funbags!			",218,98,3,24,13,1,35

A game with good and bad aspects everywhere but a unexciting campaign and heavily recycled gameplay let this game down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That alone killed my interest but a friend convinced me to Download the Ultimate Apacolypse mod for SS which I did with a great deal of wariness when you consider most Mods only add a little, boy was I wrong as UA is what the game should have initially been like had they not decided to appeal to the casuals.Base game 0/10Ultimate Apacolypse Mod 10/10 [http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod/downloads/ultimate-apocalypse-the-hunt-begins]Get it only for the Mod it is well worth it.(Seems they have fixed the Key issue therefore in light of that I re-reccomend the game).

												[/h1]"" For the Greater Good ""[/h1]So, This my very first detailed review about DoW SS. The game was developed in 2008 by Iron Lore Entertainment andRelic Entertainment  and published by THQ.The game is an RTS which takes place in the universe of Warhammer 40k which is one of the most popular franchise of the Games Workshop. The game is a standalone expansion of Dawn of War (2004) After getting trhough the generals let's jump to the review itself[/h1] "" We are the Emperors chosens"" (first impressions)[/h1]So first of all the gameplay itself is a bit different that we have already get used to. We will ned to make a base for sure but we won't need to collect any resources. Instead we have to capture points (similar to Company of Heroes) and build generators. The first gives us the base recourse and the least gives us energy endeed. There are 9 playable races (!!! only 2 in multi if you don't have the previous 3 DoWs !!!) but I will talk about the later.The game itself is multiplayer oriented and have a very good community. People still making mods and play online with the game after 6 years  (don't forget the original game came out in 2004 so it is even more) so if you already decided to play you won't really get disapointed.[/h1] ""There is only war"" (immersion) [/h1]Ok the game can give you back the Wh 40k feeling better than anything: blood, gore, execute anymations, perfect voice actors, FOR THE EMPEROR BABY 11/10.[/h1] ""Claim it in the name of the Emperor!"" (campaign and single player matches)[/h1]The game mode which mocked campaign. Is basickly a VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY simplified version of total war where you have to conquer the land in a TBS map and play through battles in real time. You can also improove your general's wargear by counquesting. Great opportunity to try different races against each other nothing more nothing less. (ahh you expected lore? well that's a shame cause you won't get any in this game. Even Dark Crused had some coool quotes bettween different generals which has gone here.)There are Shcirmish maches which are as usual matches against AI in multi maps.The AI is well scaled... sometimes dumb sometimes not. All in all not bad.Campaign: 4/10 [/h1] This is it men, the moment of glory ""(multiplayer)""9 races. NIne fukking races. I don't know how but they are balanced (ok ok. some people can argue but in paper they are balanced in reality the only problem is that the players can't really know how should they play serteand factions.)Orks are the red army 2.0.Space Marines are musculer peace makers with very accurat but small group of soldiers.Chaos is similar to S.M. but less arranged and they have daemons.Imperial guards are the late game (which is usually the 8th minute) bullies.Eldar: never played eldar but they have stealth and they are quick.Necron super strong rush. don't need strategic point for recourse. Badass robots.Tau: good ranged and melle mixture. They aren't the best at anything but they have super long range. ahh and NO TURETTS BUT.The two new factions. Well I think they are totaly unreasonable.Because the Dark Eldars are OP And the sisters are (who plays them ?)  then say me how they are ment to be played. (are they girl space marines?)They just aren't as well made as the 7 above.But well let's talk a slightly bit about multi.Yu can play annihillation in deathmatch, 1v1, teamdeatchmatch (simple and usuall) There supposed to be take and hold victories too but honestly I never seen anybody playing them :/.The players are or veterans or new guys. (like myself)I never had any problems about communications and I never saw anyone being offensive if this matters.There can be some lagg but I get used to it after 2 matches.Balance and factions: 8/10[/h1]""You cannot immagine what we have seen with our eyes"" (Graphichs)[/h1]2004 engine did you waiting for?Graphichs and animations are bad but the textures are VERY WELL made so the game looks better than some of its coevals. You can make your own colour variations.Overall, the Graphich engine didn't age well but the textures are high quality.7/10[/h1]""shall I play the music hear then?""(soundtrack/music)[/h1]Well it is great.  :D 9/10(but sirously I can't really tell anything about music in general so I can't review this part like and expert[/h1]""DO YOU HEAR THE VOICES TOO?""(quotes ingame voices)[/h1]Ok well what do you think why am I typing qoutes instead the titles? BECAUSE THEY ARE AMAZING.I can't even tell how much time did I get virtual ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by listening to the amazing work the voice actors did with this game. Every single one of the quotes are memoable and the best ones like tzhe ork theme song or my personal favourite the quotes of the Theckpriests are shining like pearls. Making the game fun even if you lose.Everything sounds perfect the orks are funny the chaos is mad the space marines are baddases the necrons are spookie the imperial guard (my favourite if we look at the voice acting) is military and very good. If you fukking hear the gurdsmand speaking you just feeld their pain their fear their pray their hardihoodHELL this game is even woth to buy for its quotes.AMAZINGI can't say anything else.

												I rate the game Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Soulstorm 4/5. Good. Far from being just a mere expansion, this game is more than large enough to be an entire game in its own right with multiple factions and a different ending for each faction. This game lets you play full single player campaigns as The Imperial Guard, The Blood Ravens Space Marines, The Adeptus Sorroritas chapter of The Bloody Rose (AKA the Bolter ♥♥♥♥♥es), The forces of Chaos Undivided, The Dark Eldar, The Eldar, the Orks, The Necrons or as The Tau Empire.Of course, I played a single player campaign through as The Tau Empire (my favorite Warhammer 40k faction) and even when played (fairly leisurely though) on easy difficulty my campaign lasted for about 33 hours. There is also an extensive skirmish mode which can be played against the computer or, with the right software (such as Tunngle), with other people over the Internet. Because of all the factions you can possibly choose to play as, this is a very replayable game (and the skirmish mode has a LOT of maps to play on including all the old maps from previous Dawn of War add-ons and expansions) but this game can, at times, suffer from a sense of severe repetition and of course, it helps a lot of you like Command and Conquer style ""RTS"" (Real time Strategy as they are called) games. RTS games are not really my main thing and I'm honestly not that great at them.The (Greater) Good:+This game has all the benefits and most of the weaknesses of Warhammer 40k Dark Crusade. For the most part, this game is simply longer. If you wanted to play a Dawn of War game which is like Dark Crusade this is the game for you. The wonderful options and strategic freedom provided by the global tactical map featured in Dark Crusade returns in Soulstorm. All RTS games should give you the excellent degree of strategic freedom of choosing which battles to fight and in what order which this game gives you. The global tactical map which you use between battles also does a wonderful job of giving you a star-system wide understanding of what is going on in the war. If only Command and Conquer or Homeworld had given me this degree of choice. (I loved the Homeworld games but the degree of strategic choice offered in Soulstorm (and Dark Crusade for that matter) blows the linear campaigns of other RTS games away and ideally should set a whole new standard of freedom). +The controls are fairly intuitive and standard for a RTS game making it easy to learn.+Just as in Dark Crusade, Soulstorm reminds you to save it whenever you quit and never seems to freeze up. Indeed, I found very, very few bugs (other than units with long range being able to shoot through solid walls and a few basic path-finding problems in certain maps). This game never froze up for me.+The multiplayer mode options included in this game are truly extensive and there are a wide variety of multiplayer battlefields to fight on for 2 to 8 players at a time (Just like in Dark Crusade).+The game menus are very well designed and the ""cute"" little imperial thoughts for the day persist in this game on the main menu and on the game exit menu.Mediocre stuff:+/- The game has certain ""honor guard"" units which can be taken with you from battle to battle in a somewhat persistent manner. I love persistent armies in RTS games as they offer a whole extra degree of realistic tactical complexity. The armies in Soulstorm (and Dark Crusade) are only mildly persistent from one battle to another. Only certain squads are retained and brought with you into the next offensive. Most other units you ""created"" or called in during the battle vanish completely causing you to need to go through the process of ""creating"" the units command and conquer style all over gain during the next battle. This is totally unrealistic and I have begun to hate this common gameplay element in RTS increasingly as time goes by. I could understand that early computers might not have been able to keep track of every single unit you made from one battle to the next (MAYBE) but now games should remember every unit you ever called in or created and put those units to use in the next battle to lower the game's feeling of repetition. I want armies which have units which persist from one battle to another (or at least an option for the game to allow this).+/-The Adeptus Sorroritas and the Dark Eldar factions and the new ""air"" units (though they control just like ground units and even hover in place and don't act at all like actual air units should) are welcome additions. The ""air"" units however are a disappointment. When I think of air power I think of massive airstrikes or aircraft units which make continual strafing and bombing runs and so forth, not little hovering vehicles (like helicopters at best) which I can send here or there like any other light tank.+/- The soundtrack is adequate (the Tau theme is very fitting and probably the best new piece of music in this game) but as before it is largely boring and derivative (but not obnoxious, unless an Adeptus Sorroritas theme is playing) and sets the mood well).Bad stuff:-As is true in any other part of Dawn of War I, the graphics, especially by today's standards are adequate but mediocre and the color scheme seems a bit bland, including a wide range of beige and gray colors. It's odd to try to describe but the colors in this game tend towards faded colors as if they were being filtered through parchment. This might have been done on purpose but it does not suit some factions very well (like the Necrons or the Tau). The landscapes are particularly drab. The camera can be zoomed very far in and re-angled to any perspective but dense fog prevents you from being able to see anything approaching the whole battlefield in the main viewscreen. -Like in any other Dawn of War I game or expansion the view can never be zoomed out very far which can make selecting large numbers of units at a time (which is something I love to do to ensure that different types of units properly reinforce one another when I have a large army) pretty problematic. The perspective issues come together to severely limit how epic the battles can feel and instead make them feel more like a table-top RPG than I think a videogame should. As in Dawn of War, In Dark Crusade you always feel as though every battle is just a minor skirmish in the overall war because graphically, it always looks that way. This is a common problem in most RTS games however, even to this day. Perhaps this was remedied in Supreme Commander (and I know it was Remedied in the Homeworld games) but most RTS games definitely have this problem.-Like in Dark Crusade each faction has but one victorious single-player campaign ending. If your faction is defeated in the campaign you are essentially asked if you want to be booted out to the main menu. There is no bad ending, no final monologue showing what happens because you failed. Just a menu.-You cannot play through the single-player campaign mode either cooperatively or otherwise which is really too bad because this would have made for a great, ongoing, persistent multiplayer mode (Just like in Dark Crusade).-This game's battles, being very similar to battles found in most Command and Conquer games, are fairly repetitious. You need to get your little infantry units out and capture strategic points (or supplies as the case may be) early or else you will lose. There is no other really viable way to play and as a result your tactical options are always limited and unrealistic. In real life, well...a lot of things are different but its is ludicrous to have to capture resources during a battle to decide what forces you will get during that same battle. The forces you have and the resources you have access to in one battle should be primarily decided based on what occurred in the battle which occurred previously, NOT the battle you are playing now.

												Dis game crazy af.Pros-Crazy Af- Campaign lets you conquer a solar system- 9 factions- Like 50 skirmish maps-Save Humanity.  Venerate the Immortal Emperor- Sisters of Battle hot AF-Chaos is one of the most Epic factions ive ever seen. Space marines and demons!!!!!????? Bruh!- Tau Empire way OP if you want to destroy humanity.- Skirmish mode is just fun- All factions from other expansions.- Fun Cons-Campaign make no sense. 3 of the factions all serve the Imperium of Man, but they fight each other anyways. Stupid. - about as balanced as a ♥♥♥♥ing fat guy on a tightrope.-Imperial Guard is trash. All you have to do is attack them at the very start of the match and you already won.- Tau Empire wayyyyyy OP. Destroys any enemy in less than 15 minutes. -Necrons are trash-Orks are trash unless you let them get their big ♥♥♥♥ing llama monsters then your screwed- Donald Trumps ♥♥♥♥♥y daughter plays it- Most of the factions are either total trash or way OP. Absolutely no balance.			",124,5,0,17,9,0,19

												I rate the game Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Soulstorm 4/5. Good. Far from being just a mere expansion, this game is more than large enough to be an entire game in its own right with multiple factions and a different ending for each faction. This game lets you play full single player campaigns as The Imperial Guard, The Blood Ravens Space Marines, The Adeptus Sorroritas chapter of The Bloody Rose (AKA the Bolter ♥♥♥♥♥es), The forces of Chaos Undivided, The Dark Eldar, The Eldar, the Orks, The Necrons or as The Tau Empire.Of course, I played a single player campaign through as The Tau Empire (my favorite Warhammer 40k faction) and even when played (fairly leisurely though) on easy difficulty my campaign lasted for about 33 hours. There is also an extensive skirmish mode which can be played against the computer or, with the right software (such as Tunngle), with other people over the Internet. Because of all the factions you can possibly choose to play as, this is a very replayable game (and the skirmish mode has a LOT of maps to play on including all the old maps from previous Dawn of War add-ons and expansions) but this game can, at times, suffer from a sense of severe repetition and of course, it helps a lot of you like Command and Conquer style ""RTS"" (Real time Strategy as they are called) games. RTS games are not really my main thing and I'm honestly not that great at them.The (Greater) Good:+This game has all the benefits and most of the weaknesses of Warhammer 40k Dark Crusade. For the most part, this game is simply longer. If you wanted to play a Dawn of War game which is like Dark Crusade this is the game for you. The wonderful options and strategic freedom provided by the global tactical map featured in Dark Crusade returns in Soulstorm. All RTS games should give you the excellent degree of strategic freedom of choosing which battles to fight and in what order which this game gives you. The global tactical map which you use between battles also does a wonderful job of giving you a star-system wide understanding of what is going on in the war. If only Command and Conquer or Homeworld had given me this degree of choice. (I loved the Homeworld games but the degree of strategic choice offered in Soulstorm (and Dark Crusade for that matter) blows the linear campaigns of other RTS games away and ideally should set a whole new standard of freedom). +The controls are fairly intuitive and standard for a RTS game making it easy to learn.+Just as in Dark Crusade, Soulstorm reminds you to save it whenever you quit and never seems to freeze up. Indeed, I found very, very few bugs (other than units with long range being able to shoot through solid walls and a few basic path-finding problems in certain maps). This game never froze up for me.+The multiplayer mode options included in this game are truly extensive and there are a wide variety of multiplayer battlefields to fight on for 2 to 8 players at a time (Just like in Dark Crusade).+The game menus are very well designed and the ""cute"" little imperial thoughts for the day persist in this game on the main menu and on the game exit menu.Mediocre stuff:+/- The game has certain ""honor guard"" units which can be taken with you from battle to battle in a somewhat persistent manner. I love persistent armies in RTS games as they offer a whole extra degree of realistic tactical complexity. The armies in Soulstorm (and Dark Crusade) are only mildly persistent from one battle to another. Only certain squads are retained and brought with you into the next offensive. Most other units you ""created"" or called in during the battle vanish completely causing you to need to go through the process of ""creating"" the units command and conquer style all over gain during the next battle. This is totally unrealistic and I have begun to hate this common gameplay element in RTS increasingly as time goes by. I could understand that early computers might not have been able to keep track of every single unit you made from one battle to the next (MAYBE) but now games should remember every unit you ever called in or created and put those units to use in the next battle to lower the game's feeling of repetition. I want armies which have units which persist from one battle to another (or at least an option for the game to allow this).+/-The Adeptus Sorroritas and the Dark Eldar factions and the new ""air"" units (though they control just like ground units and even hover in place and don't act at all like actual air units should) are welcome additions. The ""air"" units however are a disappointment. When I think of air power I think of massive airstrikes or aircraft units which make continual strafing and bombing runs and so forth, not little hovering vehicles (like helicopters at best) which I can send here or there like any other light tank.+/- The soundtrack is adequate (the Tau theme is very fitting and probably the best new piece of music in this game) but as before it is largely boring and derivative (but not obnoxious, unless an Adeptus Sorroritas theme is playing) and sets the mood well).Bad stuff:-As is true in any other part of Dawn of War I, the graphics, especially by today's standards are adequate but mediocre and the color scheme seems a bit bland, including a wide range of beige and gray colors. It's odd to try to describe but the colors in this game tend towards faded colors as if they were being filtered through parchment. This might have been done on purpose but it does not suit some factions very well (like the Necrons or the Tau). The landscapes are particularly drab. The camera can be zoomed very far in and re-angled to any perspective but dense fog prevents you from being able to see anything approaching the whole battlefield in the main viewscreen. -Like in any other Dawn of War I game or expansion the view can never be zoomed out very far which can make selecting large numbers of units at a time (which is something I love to do to ensure that different types of units properly reinforce one another when I have a large army) pretty problematic. The perspective issues come together to severely limit how epic the battles can feel and instead make them feel more like a table-top RPG than I think a videogame should. As in Dawn of War, In Dark Crusade you always feel as though every battle is just a minor skirmish in the overall war because graphically, it always looks that way. This is a common problem in most RTS games however, even to this day. Perhaps this was remedied in Supreme Commander (and I know it was Remedied in the Homeworld games) but most RTS games definitely have this problem.-Like in Dark Crusade each faction has but one victorious single-player campaign ending. If your faction is defeated in the campaign you are essentially asked if you want to be booted out to the main menu. There is no bad ending, no final monologue showing what happens because you failed. Just a menu.-You cannot play through the single-player campaign mode either cooperatively or otherwise which is really too bad because this would have made for a great, ongoing, persistent multiplayer mode (Just like in Dark Crusade).-This game's battles, being very similar to battles found in most Command and Conquer games, are fairly repetitious. You need to get your little infantry units out and capture strategic points (or supplies as the case may be) early or else you will lose. There is no other really viable way to play and as a result your tactical options are always limited and unrealistic. In real life, well...a lot of things are different but its is ludicrous to have to capture resources during a battle to decide what forces you will get during that same battle. The forces you have and the resources you have access to in one battle should be primarily decided based on what occurred in the battle which occurred previously, NOT the battle you are playing now.

												This is the dying tail end of the original Dawn of War series. In each installment they have to bring in new armies, and units, to keep up interest. It felt like including the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar was just desperate ticking of boxes.I haven't played the Dark Eldar recently, but I found the Sisters to be confusing and useless. They should have done the Tyranids instead.			",29,6,0,4,1,0,12

												Amazing game. The pinicle of the series.Nice campaign system that takes what the previous expansions did and expands it on every front.Sadly...Thanks to some unknown reason, someone at Sega (?), has disconnected the confirmation method to unlock the factions from the side games: Winter Assualt and Dark Crusade.  No Necrons, Imperial Guard or Tau, on multiplayer, even if you already bought those games which still advertise this as a selling point.Unless this is a problem, if single player campaigns with medium stories is your thing (note all races are allowed in offline v cpu skrimish), highly recommended.If you like multiplayer, coop or otherwise, avoid until the developers or the forces that be resolve what is a damn annoying bug. Writing this as a negative review, was hard.  I love this game, but damn, I do hate it when such a simple fault steals away that which you bought and paid for...			",70,9,0,11,8,1,37

												Great game, don't get me wrong, but if you're buying this to unlock the races, don't. Apparently steam is no longer generating CD keys for this, Winter Assault, and Dark Crusade. Meaning to use each race, you have to start it's respective game, and they don't link. the only one that works properly is the Dawn of War GOTY Edition. So in short, if you're only going to buy expansions, buy the GOTY and only one other, otherwise you're wasting your money like I did.[FOUND AN UNNOFICIAL FIX http://megagames.com/download/261386/0 ]This review is still negative for terrible customer service. Do buy it though.			",85,4,0,4,4,0,6

 WAAAAAAUUUUGHHHWell this is a surprise. If uyou plaued Dark Crusade this is pretty much the same game, just layed out on a different map. You are technically conquering planets but in reality it's the same mechanics as Dark Crusade. One change is that each race nopw has it's own unique power which you can get by conquering them; a welcome change from Dark Crusade.Amnother change is defense. You will always start out with  just your base, which I suppose majkes things a little easier . No ssuper enemy entrenchments like the last time. In factm, that's half the issue. The game is unbelievably easy compared to the previous, but then again that game was only easy due to the egregious cheating done by the AI.For a game with so much packed it, it's rather odd that it should feel spread thin, but that is what it feels like I'm afraid. Wirth a total of 9 races no race feels truly distinct beyond aesthetics.Still this is a solid game for any RTS fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, but buying this supports Sega's new push to turn every Gamespy game they own into crap by breaking all old mods, removing LAN/Direct IP support, and actively punishing legitimate customers by not offering a downgrade ""beta"" to revert to the pre-Steamworks version.DO NOT BUY.  Show Sega that we need to have Gamespy-enabled games remain untouched in some form rather than being butchered in the name of progress!  Seriously, Sega, it'd take all of two seconds to add a ""retail version"" beta to the Public Betas tab, which would allow those of us who don't care for online play and only plan on LANs to continue enjoying mods and other fun stuff.  Don't punish legitimate customers by patching out features that make the game fun and forcing them to look for alternatives, legit or not.			",130,18,7,38,11,2,38

												So, I wanted to get this game for a long time because I love Warhammer 40k (like most people who play these games) and The Sisters of Battle are my favorite faction in the imperium and I was super bummed to find out that they were not in the original Dawn of War. When I heared that Soulstorm has playable Sisters, I jumped on that like a fat kid on cake.Well... after over 10 Hours of playtime, I'm angry and frustraded. I don't really play much multiplayer, I just prefere singleplayer... but... well... this game is just too frustrating and hard. I like the Idea of the campaign mode, but the execution is horrible. It is a cool concept: You pick your side in the conflict, you have your warlord that you can equip with gear and maintain an honor guard... and you generally try to conquer your way through this planetary system. You fight your opponents in little skirmish type battles and try to win. Every win nets you new perks and that is neat. So Obviously, I played Sisters of Battle. As the Sisters, you start on the same planet as the Imperial Guard and that will be your first opponent. Now, I was already kinda disappointed that I also had to fight Imperial forces but oh well. Now, You would think that, because it is just the start of the game, you could just rush through the first few encounters and get to the hard part later, right? I got stomped in the first mission. Maybe it was because I didn't knew what I was really doing but they just pushed me into my base and I couldn't do anything but watch the guard with all their troops rush me to death. I retried and won, but it still wasn't easy. I basically had to rush them as fast as possible with as many sisters as possible or I was mayorly screwed. After some more battles against the guard and getting really tired of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I finally managed to push them back to their base. Alright. Now, every faction has their own base where you have a special mission with special objectives to win. This is where things turned for the worse. The mission is basically neigh impossible. You are beset on all sides with guardsman, you have to stop a convey that can spawn from multiple locations before it reaches the base otherwise the guard gets a BANEBLADE, you are constantly fighting against the clock because after a while they start pumping out more and more dangerous units (not to mention that they send those units after you mercilessly), you can't really capture anything because you are on a timer basically, you have to multitask all the time because you can be attacked from anywhere at anytime and not even your base is really safe and while trying to manage all that, there comes a giant artillery cannon that will blast an entire squad in one shot and to stop it you have to walk through a gauntlet of turrets, guardsmen, tanks, sentinels and more more more turrets. It is literal hell and not fun. I tried this mission over and over and over for 8 Hours before I decided that this is not worth my time and I tried to cheat... and the game wouldn't even give me that way out.This is the worst time I had in a long time. Not because the game itself is bad... it is based on dawn of war and has my favorite faction in it so it gets a gold star in raw gameplay... but because the missions are insanely hard and the AI is horrendesly unforgiving on normal and brutally unbeliveably stupid on easy. I also tried skirmish matches (to try out my second to favorite faction, the Tau), set AI difficulty to normal and I got blasted harder than I have ever been blasted by a human opponent. So, I thought I'd try easy... the enemy did not try to capture any points, their guys never left the base and they never bought upgrades. It was boring to say the least. Why is this game this bad?I had fun with Dawn of War and Dawn of War 2 is also really really fun, why does the only game in the series with my favorite faction suck so much? I will never understand.Do yourself a favor and don't play this game if you don't want to play it multiplayer. It is just not worth the anger it causes. Here is hope that Dawn of War 3 will be fun and maybe even get a Sisters DLC or something.... it would at least make up somewhat for all the frustrating hours I poured into this game...

												Whilst this game is certainly one of the best I have ever played, it has a fundamental problem, specifically the steam version, and that problem is that owning previous editions of the game does NOT unlock them in Soulstorm, no matter what you do (outwith external sources).  I would suggest waiting to see if any fixes are ever applied (which I highly doubt given the age of the game) if you wish to play anything other than Eldar, Space Marines, Chaos, Orks, Sisters of Battle or Dark Eldar in this game's multiplayer.

												PROS:- Campaigns now have more varied non-stronghold missions than the simple ol' Annihilate condition.- Dark Eldar and Sisters of Battle are rather interesting new factions to play, both with rather unique mechanics.- Strongholds in campaign are harder than ever, with a different difficulty focus - rather than having an initial difficult wave and becoming gradually easier, difficulty of waves ramps up over the course of the game.CONS- Aerial units for the older factions were very clearly added as a promotion for Games Workshop itself, which was releasing kits of flyers at the time; unfortunately, they add rather little to the game (thematically there were far less iconic than many other potential options), are poorly adapted for the game engine (mechanics-wise, they are simply units which hover, and are rendered as such) and feel forced and limited in scope by the minimalistic single-aircraft-added-to-each-faction theme. (Flyers should have been in development longer to avoid them being ""floating vehicles"", and several should've been added for them to make any impact. Soulstorm was released before the rise of DLC as a common occurence, but a few aircraft added by patch would've gone a long way.)- Campaign is more mind-numbingly tedious than ever, with the decision to scrap persistent buildings between games removing what little element of meta-strategy exists and the Ancient Gate mechanic essentially reducing campaign difficulty outside of Strongholds.- The campaign plot is convoluted (cut off by a Warp Storm which allows every race bar Tyranids into the system? Huh?) and the characters rather dislikeable.VERDICT:Play it for Skirmish/Multiplayer (previous expansions and mods theretofor lacked Dark Eldar entirely!) or use it for mods (Inquisition Daemonhunt surpasses the base game in quality of models and design, and the Witch Hunters Mod puts the Sisters of Battle of Soulstorm to shame!), but don't expect an exceptionally engaging campaign mode or major gameplay changes. The campaign system of Dark Crusade was novel then, the unit additions to previous factions satisfactory and the Tau Empire and Necrons factions quirky enough; but for Soulstorm, the novelty had worn out, and the result lacked the lustre of previous entries. The game is no worse than previous entries (albeit no better), but its value is subjective based on how much you value the meagre gameplay changes and modestly great new factions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this game, just get DC instead.The sisters of battle, Dark Eldar, and flying units arn't worth the broken♥♥♥♥♥mechanics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I.Why do I say Broken? Because what the devs did is instead of making a more intelligent A.I is they punished the player. That is a big no-no. NEVER gimp the player just to make your game harder. Remember how in DC when you took land all the buildings you built would stay there, that way in case you got invaded they were there and ready? Kiss that goodbye. Now, once you take the land all your buildings are deleted. Why? Don't ask me, but it makes defensive battle exactly the same as offensive battles. But thats not all. Not ONLY are your bases whisked away as if they have other places to be after the battle, causing you to start every game from scratch, but the computer can START with 2 bases when THEY are attacking YOU! For what reason? Because the devs were to lazy to make a compitent system so they punish the player for playing the game. It becomes incredibly frustrating when you have JUST taken control of a place, only to have the computer counter-attack forcing you into the exact same battle exept worse because now the enemy will be constantly assulting you with endgame units before the clock hits 1 minute you preventing you from building your base up. This makes it very easy to become locked in place and unable to progress any further in your campaign One good part of this game is the strongholds. Every stronghold is sufficiantly unique and somewhat challenging, though some are rather annoying, like the eldar's hold. However these are also where the games storytelling comes in and it's absolute crap. For instance, when you take the Ork stronghold it tells you that Gorgutz ""somehow"" escapes. Somehow? SOMEHOW? Come on man give me some details! Did he have his mecboyz make him a makeshift spacecraft and call in the flash Gitz to pick him up? Did he disapear into the warp? Another exapmle is the necron intro. ""Nobody knows why the necrons awoke,"" What? Nobody knows? It seems like the Eldar know why they're there but according to the writers ""nobody knows?"" Who the hell wrote this stuff?Aside from what I've wrote there are some odd audio glitches but other than that it's a pretty standard warhammer 40k game. If you have to make a choice between this and Dark Crusaide, get DC. It's better and more fair in every possable way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Soulstorm is the latest and most-played expansion pack to Dawn of War. It offers the most balance, though it's still one of the less balanced RTS games, and it has the most races.The Warhammer 40K really comes to live in this game, with memorable quotes from units and mouth-watering visuals as lasers and rockets fly. Units have special kill animations during battles in melee, making them visually impressive whether you're zoomed out or zoomed in. Each of the many factions plays very differently, from the Orks and their unit-swarming powers to the Necrons and their utterly free, but slow, units.There's a replayable campaign in Soulstorm, similar to the one offered in Dark Crusade, but most players will find their playtime in skirmishes and online. I highly reccomend playing with friends if you aren't competitive. Also of note, Soulstorm has a very impressive free mod named Codex that adds -a ton- of variety and also has options to increase the population limits on battles, allowing giant wars worthy of the Warhammer name. This mod is well worth looking into once you're done with the vanilla game. ",736,212,10,147,72,7,102

This was a complete disapointment and waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to the Dawn of War base game, this game is riddled with AI bugs and fustrating glitches. Units getting stuck in walls and not being able to move and moving as a squad is as easy as a group of soldiers with down syndrome. I liove this series but really?

												Little more than a rehash of DoW Dark Crusade, except possibly even more of a grindfest. New races and units add little to the game which largely relies on the tried and tested RTS formula of defend, defend, and defend some more until you've built up a strong enough force to wipe the enemy out.If you've already played the original DoW and the first two expansions, Soulstorm will offer nothing new to you. If you haven't played the original DoW then I'd recommend buying that instead.			",4,1,0,4,2,1,12

												I would only recommend this game to anyone if previously they have got all of DoW installments, (Original, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade) and only because then you get all of the races. The races are slightly imbalanced, however, on a big map with four plus players, this game becomes more intense as a strategy than any fast paced shooter. You micromanage like crazy, biuld units, attack, retreat ,upgrade , capture, hold, lose, take back, scout, use abilities (a mind blowing amount of them too)... And then an epic battle happens with giant Relic units and dozens of different troops and troop types. Even though DoW2 is better in physics and engine and etc. it does not have the same drive as this game... Speaking of Single player, Dark Crusade is probably the best, however for more in-depth experience I prefer the winter assault, although it is more linear.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Our weapons are terror, darkness and SPEED!""Soulstorm is the last expansion for the original Dawn of War. However, instead of a last hurrah in honour of the glorious emperor of mindkind, it just a convoluted mess of gimmicks and glitches. Before we discuss the technicalities, lets look at the content. Soulstorm adds two new races to Dawn of War: The Sisters of Battle, and the Dark Eldar. Neither are genuinely unique races, but they are different from the race their branched out of. The Sisters are a cult of fanatics who wield a wide assortment of flamethrowers and use divine powers to make themselves invincible. The Dark Eldar on the other hand are all about speed and hit and run tactics. Each race also gets a new airplane unit which reflects the race's general playstyle. Both of the new races also come with their own unique resource that can be spent to unleash special abilities on the field. Both races feel rather uninteresting. The Sisters feel space marines without the brawn, while the Dark Eldar feel like a swarm of gnats that cannot really put out any damage.Unfortunately, the problems have only just begun. The expansion is unfinished; many abilities and weapons just don't do anything. The guns on some aircraft really do no damage, while other abilities just stack ad infinitum to create an indestructible unit. It is a shame, because the campaign tries to go above and beyond what Dark Crusade had set up. More planets, more abilities, more options. However, just like I mentioned before, a lot of it just doesn't work properly. To be fair, Soulstorm's development was a mess and as a result the final product is a mess. It functions, but only barely. Playing Soulstorm is like driving a Ferrari with its tyres deflated; You may have the best car in the world, but you just can't enjoy it to the fullest because there is a glaring fault wherever, and whatever you do.

So pretty much the worst excuse for a game ever. You need to use CTRL ALT DEL to quit the game because such options as any game mode the game settings and ability to quit are only available once you have... yes you guessed it, created a profile.

												This game has numerous bugs.1)when you try to move your army by clicking on a location,your army tends not to go where it's supposed to go to.Instead it spreads itself over a large area instead of trying its best to gather in one spot,even when there is sufficient space to gather.2) multiple instances of grouped units not moving at all after clicking on a location3) multiple instances of units at the back not attacking once some units at the front have engaged the enemy.4)Multiple instances of barracks not loading the infantry screen, resulting in the players not being able to buy units5)multiple instances of cadre headquarters not displaying the screen, resulting in players not being able to buy builders/stealth teams6)multiple instances of builders not loading anything, resulting in players not being able to build anymore structuresApart from bugs, the difficulty in conquering strongholds in single player campaign is way too high. despite having almost all wargear, all honor guards, the game is too difficult as you start off with a newly established base and some builders, while your enemy starts off with multiple developed bases,multiple developed defenses and elite troops right off the start.Not only do you get attacked by troops from the start, you still have to prevent the computer from securing 3/5 critical locations so that they do not get the win. Tier2/3 computer troops vs tier 1 troops from the get-go. Fun times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is the base game worth it?NO, NO IT ISN'T. The base game is absolutely horrible, the campaign being absolutely boring and frustrating. The balance of the races and the inclusion of flying units make the multiplayer worse than Dark Crusade. This game was plagued by technical issues on launch, and some of them still exist to this day.HOWEVER, the inclusion of the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod makes this game pretty incredible. It isn't really tightly knit or easy to learn compared to Dark Crusade, but its one of the most expansive takes on the Warhammer 40k universe including most of the units from the tabletop and lore.Regardless, this review is negative because I don't include user made total conversions into the base game's evaluation.I will now address the horrible voiceacting with 2 names; Indrick Boreale and Firaeveus Carron.

Here is why:Difficult to get working - took some tampering to get to work on win 7 machine, even more on win 8.No LAN option - This is the deal breaker. if you want to play with friends, always online. This hurts when you want to play at a LAN party, as setup takes much longer than it should.Fix LAN and then I will recommend.			",271,60,6,22,34,3,52

												I've never felt more helpless on the Internet, than when i tried to mod this game. Jesus f'king christ, this is just one big nightmare.Why this game has an overwhelmingly positive amount of reviews, is completely beyond me. People are entitled to their own opinions, but there's innumerable bugs that have been in this game since its release on hardcopies, that were never fixed going into the steam version. There's abysmal support when you encounter one of these bugs.I suppose it's awesome if you're a super fan of Warhammer 40K or whatnot, but i for one, am never buying more Warhammer stuff. This is abysmal! I wish i could still get a refund, but i guess i'll have to settle with removing all the files from my computer. I hate this game and it made me hate 40K			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Soulstorm is pretty much a carbon copy of Dark Crusade. It's a standalone expansion to Dawn of War that adds two new races and using the new non-linear Grand Strategy style campaign map that THQ have grown so fond of.Like in Dark Crusade there is really no learning curve for new players. You are thrown directly into the fray with no introduction to the gameplay, units or technologies and just have to wing it as best you can. Also like in Dark Crusade you can only use the new races in multi-player unless you already own the previous Dawn of War games which is really a bummer for anyone that buys this with the intention to play with friends.The single-player is the continued development of Dark Crusade and the campaign works much the same way. The introduction of two new factions have made the map a bit bigger and this doesn't help as it only adds more grind. Playing through the single-player is essentially a progression of skirmish maps and it becomes boring, very fast. The stronghold maps are quite entertaining but they are the only fun thing in the campaign so you'll often find yourself dreading going into battle against yet another pointless incursion into your territory.The new factions introduced in Soulstorm aren't quite as interesting as the ones introduced in Dark Crusade either. Firstly you have the Sisters of Battle which are essentially the super fanatical military arm of the ""Ordo Hereticus"" in the Empire of Man. Essentially they are the people you send when it's time to massacre your own people in great numbers. They have no remorse and will willing sacrifice anyone in the name of the Emperor. In game they play much like the Space Marines, in fact they are eerily similar in terms of unit composition to the regular Space Marines, only with a somewhat disturbing tendency towards pyromania.The second new faction are the Dark Eldar which are what the Chaos Space Marines to the Eldar. Unfortunately they are not nearly as cool or as interesting. They feel like some Eldar went and smoked some Chaos but forgot to inhale. In terms of gameplay they are little more interesting than the Sisters of Battle with their fast moving units but they don't really add too much to the formula.Both factions read really well in the WH40K universe but their implementation in the Dawn of War franchise feels really poor. They just lose so much of their personality when they don't have any proper campaigns, you never feel the fanaticism of the sisters or the sadomasochism of the Dark Eldar.Sound and graphics are solid as always but as nothing new is being added it's beginning to feel a little stale.Although this installment maintains that special WH40K feel that I enjoy so much it, much like the rest of the game, has begun to feel a little stale. No new story or interesting characters have been introduced since Winter Assault and there really isn't much left.Soulstorm feels like a last attempt at squeaking out the last bit of money from Dawn of War before THQ moves on to making a proper sequel.

Positives* It is a better than average game. Buy on sale, not at full price.* As an RTS fan I can say that this game has an interesting take on the subject and is fun; that being said I've never played multiplayer, so my review is based on single player only. * The single player campaign I felt was decent, not the best. I feel that the missions took too long in order to properly enjoy the story.Negatives* Single player campaign missions took too long in most cases, and made it difficult to become fully engaged into the story. Thus the story became not enjoyable.* The characters didn't grab my attention as much compared to the Dawn of War 2. The story was simple, with obvious twists; and didn't teach enough about the Warhammer Universe or history to really get me into that world. That being said I did enjoy Gabriel Angelos, but he wasn't in the expansions!* By comparison, I'd rather spend an hour listening to a documentary about the imperium of man, and the empire, than spending an hour on a single mission.* No steam achievements.ResultDoW 1 and DLC = 6/10.If you must play this game, buy it on sale and not at full price. I also highly recommend Dawn of War 2 instead; although base building is removed, I feel it is the superior game for its story.Additional NoteSeems people don't like my review, please inform me why in the comments, thank you.

												A major disappointment after how good Dark Crusade was. The two new races add nothing new (there's already 7 from the previous expansions), air units are basically flying tanks that only ranged units can attack (and there's a lot of melee units so this is kind of a big deal), and the campaign is recycled from Dark Crusade with marginal changes. Worst expansion and not worth playing over the previous releases.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is where I started seeing the RTS Genre being taken in the wrong direction. It was like Multiplayer was imbeded into singleplayer. RTS stands for Real Time Strategy, not Sometimes Reatltime Strategy. I don't play strategy games to have to wait for the enemy to ""take its turn"". That is called Turn Based nowhere in R.T.S do I see a T.B.S. Stop trying to make the entire world happy 'cause you think it'll make you more money. I recently read somewhere that SquareEnix is realizing this, and they are apparently trying to get back to just making its 'core' gamers happy. All game companies should know this - We core gamers are what helped start your empire, Remember that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A great squad-based strategy game, not as imense as Total Annihilation but not as limited as Starcraft, where you can choose among nine insane races to wage war against up to a cluster♥♥♥♥ of seven other players. Great pacing assures that things will get interesting pretty quickly and stay that way up until the very end. Also moddable, which means you can download even more races out there!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, a fun time, especially if you are getting tired of Starcraft and C&C.Not quite as good as the core game or Imperial Guard expansion. No better or worse than the Dark Crusade, just different. They added two more races but the campaign is like Dark Crusade: You try to take over all zones in a star system. Most of the maps are boring, and defending your areas multiple times per round can be tiresome. On Easy the AI is a joke, and from Medium upwards the AI is brutally efficient. Dark Eldar in particular have a bad habit of standing around doing nothing.However, theres plenty of options for Skirmish, and a LOT of maps. More than any previous version of the game. This will probably be your default program for multiplayer and AI single player, as it has all the factions and all the maps.But if you want a solid campaign experience on any difficulty, you need to play the Gold edition.

												NOTE: This is the final version of Dawn of War, and really the only one you need. Dawn of War had four races. Each expansion pack added at least one additional race. Soul Storm was the final expansion, and includes all of the races for the game (except Tyrannids, but there's a great mod that adds them!) The only things it lacks are the individual campaigns from the expansions, but frankly, they're not interesting enough to bother with. JUST BUY SOULSTORM, and you've got everything you need.Alright, the review. Dawn of War is a real-time strategy game the relies very heavily on position. Unlike most RTS games, where you can simply hunker down and build up an army, here you have to go looking for the scarce resources you need. That means taking risks. Once you have what you need, you get to see a Warhammer 40,000 army in action in a way never before seen. You move your troops in squads, and those squads act on their own. You can only do so much; march them into certain death and they'll break, panic, and end up getting destroyed. You are very much the commander here, not a fighting participant, and your orders mean less than the situation in front of them. The won't retreat, but poorly thought out orders mean a quick death.In terms of appearance, the game is authentic to the table-top models. The Space Marines look clunky, the Necrons like an ancient Egyptian nightmare, and so forth. The models are well detailed and reasonably individual. When standing idle, they look around, check their weapons, and do what idle solders do. When in battle, they really look like they're fighting it out, making contact with their enemies, and experiencing the impact of their enemy's weapons. The sound is about what you'd expect. Unit acknowledgments are race specific, so the Space Marines end up sounding like the fanatical, long-lived Army of the Damned they are. The Eldar come off as arrogant. The Chaos forces sound a lot like that guy in your office who has been stuck at the same job for twenty years, hates life, and has sworn allegiance to the terrible, dark gods. (Sorry, is that only this one guy I know?) In the end, the audio cues do what they're supposed to; remind you that there are no good guys in Warhammer 40K. The music is, in a word, generic. The campaign in Soulstorm is much as it was in the previous expansion; a territory-hopping game stretched over several planets. Each race takes turns moving, reinforcing, and attacking. It's nothing special, but an enjoyable way to learn all the races. In the end, I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn Of War: Soulstorm had promise. Two new races, a campigan over an entire system, and unique new units. The problems regarding Soulstorm is the lack of balance, the amibitious story mode which felt lifeless with none of the banter that was displayed in Dark Crusade, nothing new in terms of multiplayer, and the wargear mode is just recycled stuff from Dark Crusade. Unless you play on Hard mode, Soulstorm is a somewhat of a breeze to beat ranging from 8-13 hours. Soulstorm is nice to have around just have access to new factions, but beyond that it isn't worth time and money.			",85,10,0,23,12,1,42

												Although growing old in years, DoW is a landmark RTS and is the best WH40K game that has been made in terms of sheer content and variety. Whilst the campaign is lacklustre, having 9 races that play very differently is an incredible feat, backed up by just how much extra content you can find from the mod scene. The game was launched with ease of modding in mind and as such you can massively expand the game into the most comprehensive WH40K game that has ever been made, and possibly will ever be.

												An excellent strategy game. It's resources are based on capturing strategic locations and fortifying them with listening posts which forces you to get out there and fight. Moral is also a significant factor, and special weapons can help to break enemy moral making them easier to kill and reducing their damage which adds another layer to the available tactics. There are also a myriad different races to choose from if you own all the expansions, which are well worth it in my opinion. In this RTS fortune truly favors the bold. My only complaint was that Dawn of War never released Tyranids, and I have vowed never to buy another Games Workshop game until the finish off this series properly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a bad expansion.  Adds two new races, a new story mode.  Of the two new races i find the Dark Eldar more intresting. The Sisters of battle are pretty similar to Space Marines but with a high focus on short range weapons.  My only two main gripes with the expansion are that the computer A.I. will often try to build smaller secondary bases when on the run making battles take too long.  And the stronghold mission against the Sisters of battle is an unreasonable pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Its not hard just annoying because you have to destroy three statues while fending of a near invunerable Monsterous creature. That being said if you liked Dawn of War up to this point then this breaths in a few more hours of life into the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite being released after dark crusade, this game never shakes the feeling of somehow looking and playing worse. The graphics in-game are of course the same, but the campaign interface looks grainy and poorly thrown together. Air units add no strategic depth to the game. The map design isn't great (they went overboard trying to restrict infantry movement to make air units more relevant I guess). The AI isnt very good, but better than in DC (I think).But there are 2 new factions to play as, which are both done with the same high quality artwork, balancing, and voice acting we got for the others, so no scimping here. I would have played this game for the voice acting alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy this game and it's expansions when they get on sale, and install the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod and it's map packs. You will then have *the* best RTS game. The Warhammer: 40k universe is colorful, unique and darkly beautiful, and the plethora of unique factions in this game represent this very well. Dawn of War is easy to understand and tough to master, with hundreds of units and dozens of unique battlefield types that take you to demolished gothic cities, frozen tundras, dense jungles, volcanic wastelands and lifeless moons to name a few.Gameplay is tactical yet simple, with upgrades available for each unit and parts of the terrain that can be used to give units defensive bonuses, such as blown-out craters. Different unit types are more effective against others, making for a rock-paper-scissors dynamic that requires you to carefully choose your targets.You can also customize your armies with different color schemes, banners and insignias for your buildings and units.Multiplayer battles with friends against the computer will be crazy amounts of fun.Long live the Emperor/10			",120,14,0,33,5,0,24

												This game, plus the Ultimate Apocalypse mod, makes it insane and amazing at the same time, all the races (which assuming you own the games already you can use a race unlocker with the serial number for the games to unlock all the races in the game, thus you need not have the other games installed, useful tip for saving HDD space).I only play this on Hard with the UA mod installed now, and with all the new models, all the new modes of game play and all the massive array of maps you can get for this game, its without a doubt one of the best RTS games out there, mainly for gameplay, stategy and the shere amount of bodies you can pile up on the battlefieldRaces in the UA mod and all the other games installed or unlocked with race unlocker would include:Imperial Guard: Defensive bunch, but you do need to expand and then defend with them, so loads of turrets and walls.Sisters of Battle: Offensive ranged race, do have melee capability but similar in offensive capability to the Space Marines.Space Marines: Offensive predominantly ranged, though can melee and are an awesome race to play as.Inquisition Daemon Hunters: Offensive and Defensive, so balanced, harder to play as but specialise in anti demon or monster weaponary, so you;'d use these against, chaos, chaos daemons, orks and tyranids.Eldar: Stealthy and very much infiltrate and move around race, can be devastating if you know how to use them correctly, you'll always be moving your base around with them.Dark Eldar: Expect alot of blood and alot of murder with these guys, again like eldar these are quick brutal attack then flee again race, but essentially fleeing with the souls of your foes to feed the war effort.Necrons: A powerful offensive race, very very powerful at the early stage and even more so at later stage of the game, can be used for defence as well. effective against everything.Chaos: Offensive ranged, or melee, effective against all. Chaos Daemons: Very very powerful race at the moment would destroy most races in 1 vs 1, hell even 1 vs 2 is hard with them, they are obviously countered by the Inquistion race but are still hard to defeat, very very offensive race.Orks: Mass swarm type game play, you'll build numbers then just swarm your enemy, easy to kill any single unit but in a massive bulk swarm they can overrun most other races defenses, offensive race.Tau: Offensive or Defensive so balanced, you can build great barriers to defend your base or send in semi organic armoured units into the fray, predominantly ranged though the kroot upgrade you can build more on the lines of melee units.Tyranids: haha these are basically monsters, they are a massive swarm army and very devastating in battle, if you are to go against these its best to have a massive line of defensive turrets and alot of ranged units with melee in the front to defend the ranged, they swarm on an epic scale. Very offensive race.Anyway I'd highly recommend this game, I've had 100's of hours in it, mainly outside of steam and coop with a buddy on the online servers and battle it out on a custom map whether downloaded or you've made it yourself, a very very good game overall.

												While not having the story driven campaing of the original game (or any lore at all) it futures alot more races, you get to play around as the: Battle sisters, blood ravens, Tao, Necrons, Orks, Eldars and dark eldars! as the original game this is also super easy to mod, and has a tactical (but kinda repetetive) Conquer mode (which is called campaign for some reason). the conquer mode gives of a kinda Tiberium wars feeling (C&C) and therest of the game is technically the same, spanning the awesome multiplayer, and army painter! a great expansion that thrives best in multiplayer!

												10/10 by far one of the most accurate descriptions of how life goes down in the imperium, You might be mad or angry that they didnt add the tyranids or the inquisition or chaos daemons for that matter.But dont worry, I reccomend downloading the Ultimate Apocalypse mod The Hunt Begins. This immersive mod adds the affore mentioned races and also adds innumerable amounts of new units and other upgrades to enhance your Commanders and troops.Also just be careful about the tyranids, ive lost to them every time i have played against them you wont know the meaning of swarms till you try to fight them.           Overall i reccomend this game to anyone interested in in a fast paced and fun Warhammer 40k RTS and the best of the franchise so far. For the Imperium!                                       P.S.                                     The mod adds Titans			",61,8,0,15,11,1,21

												Difference between Dark Crusade and Soulstorm in Campain is not much big. Same rules, same objectives, but I noticed when you attacking to other races, there is not interaction between them as in Dark Crusade, just cumulatively for all. I  encounter to conversation between them. Obviously, main race bases are easier than other territories.Story is superficial and not interested me as in Dark Crusade.New races are cool, but flying units opens new strategies through air and I don't like it. Yes, you have units, which can port or jump but it has cooldown. Start game is slower, which prevents from rushing so early.If I compare Soulstorm and Dark Crusade, Dark Crusade is better, but you need to play both so you can compare it and enjoy it.

Campaign give a lot of fun, specially in later stages when your Hero is more powerful and have bodyguards(e.g some mission u can win only with hero :D). The good move from programmer is that each Fortress of each nation has different plot.About multiplayer: nowadays it is hard to find players but if you find game give you from 4 to ~30 min of entertain.

SEGA added a patch to the game that added a single new map AT THE COST OF REMOVING LAN from the game.

												Having played all of the other Dawn of War games, this one certainly seems to be the weakest of the series.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a load of fun, but when compared to the other installments in the series, this one feels a bit phoned in.  If you've ever played Dark Crusade, it's very much like that.  But, in case you haven't, in Soulstorm you choose one of nine factions to lead to victory over the Kaurava system.  The system is divided into territories spanned across 4 planets and 3 moons.  Each faction starts controlling a certain number of territories, whereas the player starts with only a single territory.  Each faction must then battle it out for control of each territory in the system.  You defeat other factions by conquering their primary territory, known as their stronghold.  In Dark Crusade the campaign played out in much the same fashion, but over a single planet rather than a system.  Furthermore, the backstory for the planet and each of the individual territories felt much more fleshed out in Dark Crusade.  The reasoning for the presence of each faction was better explained and the entire game just seemd to have more personality.Aside from this, Soulstorm is really just more of the same.  And that's great if you're a Dawn of War fan.  It's great to finally see the Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle) added to the game and the gameplay works just as well as it ever has.Ultimately, I would recommend this game but only if you enjoyed the other Dawn of War installments.  If this is your first introduction to the Dawn of War Series, I would strongly recommend playing the other games first.			",14,4,0,4,7,0,12

												This game is awesome.  It encourages you to go out and capture a significant portion of the map and take the fight to strategic points all over the game field.  Fighters are purchased in squads meaning that they are easier to manage than if they were in single dudes.  Squad upgrades are a thing.  so I can have one squad of marines with flamers and another with bolters.  The campaign is awesome.  Its a little like risk.  It allows you to get an honor guard who will start in play with your commander.  Also, your commander can get sick upgrades throughout the campaign.  Each faction you conquer gives you a unique and cool bonus relating to the over all campaign.  also, there are a lot of factions, each very different from the others.  for example, one faction's first unit is a stealth unit.  another straight up doesn't use one of the basic resources.  The only con is that with the multitude of factions, they aren't perfectly balanced.  It does not ruin the game thoughA really creative and cool game that has kept me entertained for years.

												The Dawn of War series (The original, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm) is one of the most incredible RTSes out there. It has fluid action, unit counters that force tactical play, and it even allows one of the rarest options in any RTS. . Persistant corpses. You can actually count (or lose count of) the number of bodies that litter a battlefield. Oddly, this is a feature I wish more RTSes had. I guess I'm just twisted that way.Resources are simple: You take requisition points to steadily generate requisition (the main resource) and you build generators to produce power (the secondary resource). There's good unit variety among a total of 9 factions in all if you own all of the expansions. Note that buying Soulstorm will NOT let you play factions in multiplayer which were released prior to it without CD keys for those races. You need to own a copy of each respective game to play its races in a multiplayer mode. The only gripe I have is its lack of backward compatibility with its prior games, which is a shame since you need to own those games to play those races. For example, I have been unable to get a game going with my friend because he has Dark Crusade but not Soulstorm. His game does not recognize the Soulstorm races, and we had no luck finding a patch for it. This is -very bad- for this kind of expansion style. You can however play any race in skirmish mode regardless of having prior expansions, which I also find to be a little odd, but at least you can try the races in single player.Besides my gripe on the expansions, if you want an RTS that is phenominal, I give Dawn of War two thumbs up. It currently comes with all prior expansions in one Steam pack, and Soulstorm as a seperate game. This is a must play if you are an RTS fanatic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My number one favourite RTS and one of my favourite games of all time. I had a physical copy of the game back then but I lost it so I bought this during the summer sale. Really brings back awesome memories with this game. The Dawn of War series introduced me to the Warhammer 40k lore which I absolutely fell in love with. Although the game may not be accurate in representing the lore (Bolters became assault rifles instead of automatic grenade launchers), it still does well in providing a virtual spectacle of what war in the Warhammer 40k universe would look and feel like which is destruction and chaos involving different races with their different weapons, technologies and abilities. It is very satisfying to see the forces of the Emperor purge the heretic and xeno scum in this awesome game. FOR THE EMPRAH! Rating: 10/10			",109,7,0,4,3,0,9

												In my opinion, the Dawn of War saga has proven to be a solid and timeless RTS. Warhammer 40k unvierse + Starcraft-like-engine = WIN. The campaign is rather nice with interesting voice-acting and cut-scenes featuring: orki orks, manly space marines, dark daemons, naugty necrons, stoic sisters, grim imperial guard, and crazy chaos all of which are playable races. Player created mods basically make the game a whole new experience with infinite possible new units, races, textures, etc. 10/10 I play it everyday. It can be difficult to get online to work with mods (everrrything has to match to the .0001 lol) but the vanilla game online can be quite fun!			",50,0,0,7,7,0,15

												The ultimate Dawn of War 1 game for multiplayer. It has a wide variety of armies and battlefields to choose from. But if you're more interested in playing the single player campaign, Dark Crusade might be better for you. They both have the same campaign style: letting you take whichever army you want for galactic conquest. But in Soulstorm the armies tend to stick to the same battlefields every time you play through with a different army where with Dark Crusade, every playthrough will be a little more different.

												This game is wonderful, and yet, it ALMOST ruined the series at the same time. Dawn of War: Soulstorm is the pinnacle of the first DoW series, with a maximum of nine races and the largest campaign. However, the new units, which are in particular, airborne units, broke the game, and to this day get stuck in impassable terrain and will need to be executed and re-built to provide any usefulness whatsoever. Now that we've gotten past that gripe, let me brag about this game for a while. The visuals aren't Crysis or Battlefield tier, but they're still not half-bad for a game as old as it is. The story had classic Warhammer elements, and has a maximum of nine endings, with each ending depending on what race you play. And the mods. I have maybe 15 mods on this game, which add anything from races to units to nukes (look up the Apocalypse Mod; it is glorious). So, Soulstorm, on it's own, is a decent game. Mod it, and it may as well have just come out yesterday.			",167,9,0,9,8,2,26

												Anyone who has ever played RTS games will know about Dawn of War.Soulstorm was the final iteration of the Original THQ set and honestly the best all around.The including of 2 new races the Sisters of Battle and the Dark Eldar as well as certain power abilites makes the fun even that much more enjoyable.I personally use the Apocalypse/The Grand Hunt Mod packs for badass units you can't get in the normal game.  In Regards to this, 1 on 7 Orcs is not fun I repeat NOT FUN!!!			",247,47,0,69,29,4,66

												So many armies to play with, so many maps, so many scenarios you could play out, Multiplayer is a blast!Every army plays differently, all holding a different play style for everyone to explore. There is often so many ways to approach an enemy team, you could send in a massive group of infantry and tanks, you could bomb them from afar, you could slowly take the land for yourself to win a battle of attrition, or you simply focus on defense. 8/10Graphics do show it's age at times, but not enough to hinder the gameplay or fun. The Enemy AI is either extremely hard, or extremely easy depending how you set the difficulty. Worth the 12 bucks, but if there's a big discount on the 40k franchise like there was a while back, just buy all the games at one time. I spent about 8 bucks on all the DOW 1 games and the first DOW 2.			",25,4,0,0,2,0,5

												The final of the Dawn of War series, Soulstorm lets you play as Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Sisters of Battle, Orks, Tau, Necron, Eldar, Dark Eldar and Chaos Space Marines. The single player campaign lets you choose your race, with which you must dominate the Kaurava system's planets (same world map for every race). Same Multiplayer as the previous ones, too. ****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

												Wonderfully Epic strategic game that gave me many hours of entertainment through a variety of crusades and crush matches within the campaign mode. This is made even better through available mods such as Titanium Wars and Ultimate Apocalypse Mod. Also if you like this you must try out the original Dawn of War GOTY Edition to embark upon the epic story of the Blood Raven's chapter of Space Marines.-Highly recommended for fans of strategy games or the Dawn of War 40k universe.-			",106,13,0,23,8,0,23

												The Dawn of War series (The original, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm) is one of the most incredible RTSes out there. It has fluid action, unit counters that force tactical play, and it even allows one of the rarest options in any RTS. . Persistant corpses. You can actually count (or lose count of) the number of bodies that litter a battlefield. Oddly, this is a feature I wish more RTSes had. I guess I'm just twisted that way.Resources are simple: You take requisition points to steadily generate requisition (the main resource) and you build generators to produce power (the secondary resource). There's good unit variety among a total of 9 factions in all if you own all of the expansions. Note that buying Soulstorm will NOT let you play factions in multiplayer which were released prior to it without CD keys for those races. You need to own a copy of each respective game to play its races in a multiplayer mode. The only gripe I have is its lack of backward compatibility with its prior games, which is a shame since you need to own those games to play those races. For example, I have been unable to get a game going with my friend because he has Dark Crusade but not Soulstorm. His game does not recognize the Soulstorm races, and we had no luck finding a patch for it. This is -very bad- for this kind of expansion style. You can however play any race in skirmish mode regardless of having prior expansions, which I also find to be a little odd, but at least you can try the races in single player.Besides my gripe on the expansions, if you want an RTS that is phenominal, I give Dawn of War two thumbs up. It currently comes with all prior expansions in one Steam pack, and Soulstorm as a seperate game. This is a must play if you are an RTS fanatic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The ultimate Dawn of War 1 game for multiplayer. It has a wide variety of armies and battlefields to choose from. But if you're more interested in playing the single player campaign, Dark Crusade might be better for you. They both have the same campaign style: letting you take whichever army you want for galactic conquest. But in Soulstorm the armies tend to stick to the same battlefields every time you play through with a different army where with Dark Crusade, every playthrough will be a little more different.

												The worst in the Dawn of War series yo. The single player campaign is lacking; in Dark Crusade you had missions where you planted bombs and ran off like a badass, here you blow up four HQ's and win. The witty banter between commanders is missing as well replaced with generic ""Hey we gotta go over here now"". The new air units seem pretty pointless. On the upside though the new factions are nice; the Dark Eldar seem to be about speed while the Sisters of Battle are about burning everything with flamethower mounted everything. Also Indrick Borale's voice actor is funny with his talk about BATTOL BRUTHAS.			",493,135,6,70,40,3,66

												Dawn of War is certainly one of the most addictive RTS ever released. Definitely some flaws, such as a camera way too close to the ground, and a crappy pathfinding, but the game mechanics in the W40k universe are great. The graphics are still reasonably good even 7 years later.Soulstorm and the other standalone, Dark Crusade, have aged much better than the original game and its first extension.Oh, yes, I forgot... for the emprah !

												Buy this game and it's expansions when they get on sale, and install the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod and it's map packs. You will then have *the* best RTS game. The Warhammer: 40k universe is colorful, unique and darkly beautiful, and the plethora of unique factions in this game represent this very well. Dawn of War is easy to understand and tough to master, with hundreds of units and dozens of unique battlefield types that take you to demolished gothic cities, frozen tundras, dense jungles, volcanic wastelands and lifeless moons to name a few.Gameplay is tactical yet simple, with upgrades available for each unit and parts of the terrain that can be used to give units defensive bonuses, such as blown-out craters. Different unit types are more effective against others, making for a rock-paper-scissors dynamic that requires you to carefully choose your targets.You can also customize your armies with different color schemes, banners and insignias for your buildings and units.Multiplayer battles with friends against the computer will be crazy amounts of fun.Long live the Emperor/10			",120,14,0,33,5,0,24

												This game in itself is very mediocre. It's an alright game, worth the money, and it can keep you entertained for a few hours. The campaign itself didn't really do it for me, the first DoW campaign was way better. Skirmish is really fun though.The balance between the races are really broken. The Tau for example don't have turrets or mines, so though they have a strong offence, their defence is is lacking and unless you constantly have an army at your disposal you're pretty much doomed. The IG is pretty much overpowered as their soldiers may be weak, but there are a lot of them, and they're quick to train and cheap as well.If you download and install the Ultimate Apocalypse mod however, this game instantly becomes a masterpiece. It fixes all problem (or most) such as the lack of turrets for the tau, and they even created their very own models! Combine it with the Tyranid mod and you get tyranids as an additional army, though I personally don't enjoy them too much.Highly recommended.			",19,4,0,2,5,0,10

												PROs:> Action can start virtually immediately after the game starts. Most RTS games require a period of base building that can become repetitious and makes the early game boring. Soul Storm doesn't really have a lot in the way of base buildings, although it certainly is a component of the game. Unlike games such as Age of Empires, you can choose to start the combat as early as you like.> Resources are linked to map control. You actually have to play the game and compete with the other players for strategic locations. Capturing these and controlling them gives you your base resources, with the exception of necrons> EPIC MODS: Such as titanium wars and Ultimate Apocalypse mod completely overhaul the size of the game in case you ever feel like something more> No stalemates. Unlike many RTS games, where defenses can indefinitely stall the game, Armies in SS are the dominant force. The winner is the player with the biggest gun, not shield.> Logical and straigtforward mechanics: There are two types of resources and both have very different acquisition methods, exceptions for Orks and Necrons. There are many races, and all of them are as different as can reasonably be expected. The more similar a race is, the more similar their game play. Units work by building squads, not individual units, which reduces the requirements for micromanagement in fights, which speeds up the game instead of simplifying it.> Unique game play, styles and abilities for different races.> Active Online community, with plenty of competent players> Sound track is well suited, easy to listen to for hours on end.> Play with your friends for added fun> Still highly enjoyable after 100 hours (especially with mods)CONs:> Not every race is equally powerful. Dark Eldar are objectively the weakest, absolute trash. > Multitude of balance tweaks required.> Campaign is utterly lackluster, repetitious and grinding.> Camera zoom is very close, and off-putting for your first few gamesOverall: 8/10. Very satisfactory for an RTS. All RTS players ought to try this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not having the story driven campaing of the original game (or any lore at all) it futures alot more races, you get to play around as the: Battle sisters, blood ravens, Tao, Necrons, Orks, Eldars and dark eldars! as the original game this is also super easy to mod, and has a tactical (but kinda repetetive) Conquer mode (which is called campaign for some reason). the conquer mode gives of a kinda Tiberium wars feeling (C&C) and therest of the game is technically the same, spanning the awesome multiplayer, and army painter! a great expansion that thrives best in multiplayer!

												My all time favorite video game genre has always been real time strategy, and although there are many different games that come to mind when i think of my all time favorite, its always dawn of war. I'm not sure if its the huge universe it throws you into, or the vast amount of strategy involved in a single match, I will always pick this game over any other as my favorite rts game.

												Wether your playing this game as a standalone or playing with the base games it will give you hours of playtime. Even so it is best played with the core game and the Winter assault and Dark Crusade expansions.Pros:- Good selection of playable factions. - Decent amount of maps of varying sizes.- Cood campaign that is semi-linear allowing you to choose which battles you play depending on which faction you choose.- Each faction has its own play style, strenghts, and weaknesses.- Can make your own colour schemes for use in skirmish and multiplayer modes.Cons:- Most of the factions have a very rigid playstyles.- Some factions have limited or nearly no counters to others so are easily defeated. (Stealth being the worst offender for some of the factions)- Campaign isn't really a story, but more a multi-battle system with a back story for each faction's involvement.			",94,17,3,20,19,3,57

												I cannot tell you how many hours I've played this Relic epic of an RTS prior to Steam.  What I will say is that Relic and Steam were completely awesome in providing me with a new software key to download the game through Steam (with proof of purchase of the hard CD some years ago) and keep playing.While now dated, I must say the entire Dawn of War series, with Soulstorm as the final game in the first DoW series, was nothing but one of the finest RTS games I ever played.  I cut my teeth on the old Red Alert series, Dune 2000, and others and never really cared for the genre until Relic's classic Homeworld.  DoW brought that level of RTS to the ground in the 40K universe.  While hardcore 40K fans have far too many complaints, I think DoW's strenghts have outstripped any weaknesses.  Gameplay can be repetitive however.  DoW:Dark Crusade and Soulstorm are extremely similar in campaign play.  While Dark Crusade only covers a planet, the solar system covered in Soulstorm is only slightly larger.  The usual strategy employed in Dark Crusade of entering a  new territory and base building until you have enough of a force to conquer the enemy base is repeated with little exceptions except for the capture the flag battles for webway gates territory.I do not think the weaknesses detract from campaign play too much.  Followers of the WH40K lore are likely to enjoy playing each race through the end of their respective end game content.  It is enjoyable just for that alone.  Then there is multiplayer....

												Now I do really enjoy this game. Although I feel that I like Dark Crusade more. This game as well as DC made me REEEALLY despise the Imperial Guard. Maybe it's just my play style or I suck at it, but they almost always give me a hard time. I do play as the Tau most of the time. Soul Storm is a great RTS. One of the first RTS games that I had played. Fell in love with it instantly. I also played the table top version of WH 40k back in the day.  The game-play is solid and still holds up till this day. There are a few nit-picks I have about this game, but they're really no different than anyone else who loves and enjoys the game.I wish that bases remained after a conquest instead of having to rebuild from the ground up time and time again. It can get especially tedious if you're constantly defending the same territory from the same persistant race.			",6,6,0,2,4,0,6

And then, when you think time has come to put this game to sleep, look out for some mods.And then the real Killing, Burning and Destroying starts. With nukes and titans, from Ultimate apocalypse mod, or swarming with tyranids from tyranids mod. Plenty of stuff to do with it, so do not wait and jump between your enemies.Cause this is dawn of war and there is a soulstorm on the battlefield.That means lot of enemies, and only thing you really need is more enemies !!!

												Get the game. but get it for the mods. If you know how to handle yourself and are happy to jump through a few hoops, Install Titanium Wars, If your looking for a ezy install mod go do Ultimate Apocolypse. I won't be reviewing the game itself, there are other reviews for that, and my opinion is frank, Its the best RTS out there next to Starcraft, and not as outragously competative.  What I will be doing is compairing the two top teir mods for the game.Ultimate Apocolypse; Races it adds; Tyranids, Deamons, Ordo malleusStuff it fixes; Not much (as far as I can see)For unit comparisons I will be using Space Marines, For easy refrence.Apocolypse adds in a selection of units from table top, as well as 2 titans and fair selection of the bigger tanks. However it feels like things are missing For example, specalised heavy weapons squads along with Dreadnaught Mortis.Notes; it is easy to install however it feels like a somewhat paired down version of Titanium WarsTitanium Wars;Races Added; Tyranids, Administratum, Ordo Malleus, Wictch Hunters (Semi-conversion of the Sisters Of Battle to bring them on level)Stuff it Fixes; Removal of unbalanced Air units, AI pathing, Donatioins, and High speed calculations put in, AI is also capable of using the new units to their fullest. Unit Comparison; Almost every unit from table top, However against Apoc it only adds 1 titan for balanceing reasons. However it does allow for thing such as thunderhawk deployment of super heavy tanks alongside far more unit customization.Notes; Administratum and Ordo Malleus are huge, they feel like they should and have unique units to themselves, The voice acting isn't amazing (the mod-maker is russian) and installing it is a pain due to a complicated series of events that involved a spat between mod makers. Conclusion, I would go for Titanium wars, mainly because it has a larger selection of units and it makes some armies playable in multiplayer, However if you are not after balanced and just want to feild the largest army imagenable and do silly things. go for Apocolypse. In short; Get the game. For The Emperor, For the Dark gods, For the Greater Good, whatever battle cry you so choose, but mod it. get a few friends together, get them the game, get them the mods and proceed to smash titans against each other.

												Ok so ive been a long time dawn of war fan, both the first and second series of games. This dawn of war in particular is the WORST IN THE ENTIRE SERIES. But before i go into how bad it is, i highly recommended getting it for the modification value. While this game is broken, unbalanced, and the maps are truely lazy pieces of crap, there are a TON of mods that greatly fix gameplay.Things to watch for in the vanilla game. Necrons are unstoppable. and flying units ruin the entire game. heres a few mods to look at though for the game, if you get these mods the game is great!! (a bunch of the mods even affect the campaign.)http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-modhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/purgation-of-kauravahttp://www.moddb.com/mods/titanium-wars-mod-ss ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have any interest in strategy games, you need to play this. Preferrably with all of the other expansions.This is a real-time strategy game. Not a big game of rock-paper-scissors (ala C&C, which I do love as well), or who-can-make-the-most-the-fastest (ala Starcraft, less love but more hours in my younger days).The campaigns are pretty good. I especially enjoyed Winter Assualt, despite it being very short. Call me a sucker for hopeless military stories. Soulstorm is better, though. It plays like a board game, taking over the planet, battling other factions. You win a battle, you take some land and get bonuses later. You lose, you wait until the next turn and plan your next move. Then move in and play what I think (because this is a review) is the best RTS experience since...well, nothing else I've played really matches it.Despite the huge number of different armies availible with all expansions, everything is pretty well balanced. Everything caters to different players. How do a bunch of Orks beat a bunch of Space Marines, or a group of Tau beat some Eldar? You have to figure it out. The same thing doesn't work against everyone. And when you have an eight-player free-for-all, what do you do? Endless options, endless replayability.It's the 41st Milenium and let's hope war indeed never changes.			",495,86,12,102,74,2,128

												This is the weak point of the original Dawn of War series. The new races aren't as fun as their predecessors and the air units change the entire scope of the game--it's just not balanced to deal with them. There's no point in having ground warfare and the other ninety percent of your arsenal when you can just fly huge groups of ships across the map and carpet-bomb everyone.

Even if it aged a bit the grafics are still pretty and the gamplay is still usable.Also it has a lot of original ideas and this cool atmosphere.But you should probably download the zoom mod.

												Did you find yourself playing the highly recommended Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, but wanting more? How about THREE TIMES AS LONG loading screens, and more pixellation of textures? Were you sick of all that adherence to canon and godlessly excellent characterization? Well THANK THE EMPEROR, HE HATH DELIVERED A GAME FOR YOU. It's the same game as Dark Crusade with the cool meta-map feature, but this time all the mission objectives are uninspired whenever they're not like pulling rotten teeth out of a screaming child's mouth. And the new air units are ""fun"" if you find ""poorly thought out, poorly balanced, obviously not designed for this engine"" things fun!The only reason to recommend this is that one of the two new factions you get to play as are Nun Space Marines with flamethrowers. I'm not going to pretend I didn't like playing as them, but imagine: what would it have been like if they appeared in a game that was good on its own merits?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn Of War Soulstorm is without doubt my favourite game of all time, the music is atmospheric and catchy and me and my friends have spent many an afternoon singing along to the different musical themes which go with each specific race. The Campaign is set across four worlds with a huge variation of terrains. The gameplay is very fun and it is still challenging for someone who's been playing this game for many years. For a Warhammer 40K fan there's little I find more exciting than running my 40K army at another army. This game adds two new armies, the Dark Eldar and the Sisters of Battle. The Dark Eldar are most likely my favourite race (This is the army I collect) and I feel they add a good new gameplay option with the collection of souls. The Sisters of Battle aren't really my cup of tea, but hey can be very difficult to defeat. I highly recommend thi game to any 40K fans or anyone else who likes creating a awesome army. I would also recommend downloading the Ultimate Apocalypse mod from this link http://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod as it creates massive epic battles with Titans! Thanks for reading!

												Really great game. The only thing I'd fuss about is the AI, I like to try to just build a base and see how long I can hold out against a single max difficulty AI or multiple and it seems that the AI gets stuck on something. Several games I've played they just spawn the base (cultist, mandrakes, guardsmen, scouts, ect.) units over and over and over and not do anything with them really. But if I take a the difficulty a step down it works fine. That's my only fuss, still a great game. 9/10.If anyone is interested in this game and gets into it a lot, I'd recommend the Ultimate Apocalypse mod for Soulstorm. It's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, any fan of Warhammer should download it and play it. Adds so much content, a ridiculous amount. Titans, Havocs, Stormblades, Lord of Change, Plague Barers, ect. a lot of things that make the game even more incredible. Not to mention super increased unit/vehicle cap for seriously epic battles. Dawn of War: Soulstorm + Ultimate Apocalypse 100/10, would definitely recommend.			",152,8,4,7,11,1,21

												The real hook of this game for me is the campaign mode, which in similar fashion to The Dark Crusade pack plays like Risk, but with a skirmish battle for each square taken. It's hours and hours of fun, with replayability for each faction. I guess the only complaint is that it'd be nice to randomize placement of forces and capitals.I played on easy because i hadn't played Dawn of War in quite a while, and i still found that the difficulty is challenging enough for it to not be a cake walk.

												Great RTS game, I love it however there are two cons to it. First the campaign  doesn't make sense. Such as that the space marines and Imperial guard are at war with each other, and that the Sisters of battle are fighting the imperial guard. Also You would think the Battle Sisters  would start on the Chaos/Dark Eldar planet and they shouldn't be fighting the imperial guard because the imperial governer replaced the last one. So the Imperial guard's admistration is competly replaced. These three factions figting each other is illogical.  But however the Battle Sisters are extreme religious miltants that kill anyone who isn't a follower of the emperor in their eyes. People would say that they are fighting for the entire system. In the other dlc's and differnt games such as Space Marine the Space Marines and Imperial Guard are always allies unless they are corrupt. But remember the imperial guard Governer has been replaced since the oringnal  lost the system to xenos and chaos.  Second con is the difficutly setting on custom battles. On medium the other players are too fast and on easy they are too slow. Execpt those two negatives I recommend this game, It is very fun and  challeging.  The best part of the game is  killing thousands orks  in a single battle and still lose. ",39,1,0,15,11,0,22

												In my opinion, this is the best Dawn of War game. Builds off of the great advances made in The Dark Crusade, but without going too far like Dawn of War II did. Lots of races to choose from, a wonderful main campaign that is one of my favorite rts experiences ever, and a strong replayability factor. Definitely worth the price.			",13,5,0,12,13,0,14

												One of the funnest games I ever played, a competative RTS that makes you think on the go. Choose one of the 8 races that fits your style and than addapt that army to the situation at hand. Got my friends into it, and the huge three person free-for-all that we have amounts to an easy hours worth of excitement, adralanin, and obscene yelling. This game might be old, but it hold out in todays bleak RTS world like a beakon in a storm.			",108,11,0,24,7,1,40

												Get the game. but get it for the mods. If you know how to handle yourself and are happy to jump through a few hoops, Install Titanium Wars, If your looking for a ezy install mod go do Ultimate Apocolypse. I won't be reviewing the game itself, there are other reviews for that, and my opinion is frank, Its the best RTS out there next to Starcraft, and not as outragously competative.  What I will be doing is compairing the two top teir mods for the game.Ultimate Apocolypse; Races it adds; Tyranids, Deamons, Ordo malleusStuff it fixes; Not much (as far as I can see)For unit comparisons I will be using Space Marines, For easy refrence.Apocolypse adds in a selection of units from table top, as well as 2 titans and fair selection of the bigger tanks. However it feels like things are missing For example, specalised heavy weapons squads along with Dreadnaught Mortis.Notes; it is easy to install however it feels like a somewhat paired down version of Titanium WarsTitanium Wars;Races Added; Tyranids, Administratum, Ordo Malleus, Wictch Hunters (Semi-conversion of the Sisters Of Battle to bring them on level)Stuff it Fixes; Removal of unbalanced Air units, AI pathing, Donatioins, and High speed calculations put in, AI is also capable of using the new units to their fullest. Unit Comparison; Almost every unit from table top, However against Apoc it only adds 1 titan for balanceing reasons. However it does allow for thing such as thunderhawk deployment of super heavy tanks alongside far more unit customization.Notes; Administratum and Ordo Malleus are huge, they feel like they should and have unique units to themselves, The voice acting isn't amazing (the mod-maker is russian) and installing it is a pain due to a complicated series of events that involved a spat between mod makers. Conclusion, I would go for Titanium wars, mainly because it has a larger selection of units and it makes some armies playable in multiplayer, However if you are not after balanced and just want to feild the largest army imagenable and do silly things. go for Apocolypse. In short; Get the game. For The Emperor, For the Dark gods, For the Greater Good, whatever battle cry you so choose, but mod it. get a few friends together, get them the game, get them the mods and proceed to smash titans against each other.

Ever since the first Dawn of War game was released on PC, me and my dad would play this for hours battling the Ai. I was happy to hear that it was on steam cause now i can play it online with friends, which i had trouble doing when the original PC game was in stores. For those who are deciding to get the Dawn of War Franchise, you will not regret buying this game! It's well worth the original price, but during the sale is also the best time to get it.

												If not the best, then it's definitely the second best in the entire Dawn of War series, and possibly the best out of all WH40k games. It remains more accurate in squad size than any other RTS based in the WH40k world, and keeps everything pretty well balanced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off i am a huge fan of Warhammer 40k. That being said, soulstorm is a massive let down. They added two new races, the dark eldar and sisters of battle. Along with some new units for each race. The campagin is almost the same as the dark crusade, except for the lack of meat. Almost all the missions are search and destroy. The strongholds of the races are left wanting. Almost laughable, if it wernt for the fact that you had bought it..... If you're not a fan boy of these games, dont get it, if you are then you will get it anyway, to those people good luck and hopefully you get some enjoyment out of it.			",14,2,0,2,2,0,7

												Fun but by far the worst DoW expansion.

												Really love this game, 8 different races to choose from, campaign is interesting too because of the collecting of more and more honor units and new gear for your hero. It's also great that this way the campaign is playable with every available race, not only the Space Marines like in the first part of this series.I was hoping for future sequels to take this concept and just make it better where needed, but unfortunately DoW II did not meet my expectations, so this is still my favorite DoW game of all time.

Campaign give a lot of fun, specially in later stages when your Hero is more powerful and have bodyguards(e.g some mission u can win only with hero :D). The good move from programmer is that each Fortress of each nation has different plot.About multiplayer: nowadays it is hard to find players but if you find game give you from 4 to ~30 min of entertain.

												This is the best DoW yet. It builds off the great open campaign of Dark Crusade, this time making your domination interplanetary. Plus, we get two new factions, to boot. The Sisters of Battle are some bad ♥♥♥♥♥es, I tell you. Sure, they're fanatics, but purging everything with endless flames is oddly cathartic.+9 factions to choose from, so while the campaign is basically the same for all of them, each faction is pretty unique and interesting. Well, the Dark Eldar aren't exactly unique, but they are kind of funny being an evil incarnation of Hedonism Bot in horde form.+The story is good for an RTS, and isn't riddled with overly long cutscenes like the base game+Scenery is vast seeing as you have 4 planets (and 3 moons) to work through.+One playthru took me over 22 hours, so it's worth your money.-Pathfinding is still laughably terrible. I had hoped by now it would be fixed, but I guess that was too much to ask. It requires a lot of micromanagement, and will lead to you taking a lot of excess damage at times.-Graphics are dated, but that is to be expected, and it hardly makes the game unplayable. My biggest gripe is it can be difficult to command a large army when you can't zoom out very far.-Warhammers are more prevalent than TDC, but still not 40K worth, so unacceptable, TBQH.

												Did you find yourself playing the highly recommended Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, but wanting more? How about THREE TIMES AS LONG loading screens, and more pixellation of textures? Were you sick of all that adherence to canon and godlessly excellent characterization? Well THANK THE EMPEROR, HE HATH DELIVERED A GAME FOR YOU. It's the same game as Dark Crusade with the cool meta-map feature, but this time all the mission objectives are uninspired whenever they're not like pulling rotten teeth out of a screaming child's mouth. And the new air units are ""fun"" if you find ""poorly thought out, poorly balanced, obviously not designed for this engine"" things fun!The only reason to recommend this is that one of the two new factions you get to play as are Nun Space Marines with flamethrowers. I'm not going to pretend I didn't like playing as them, but imagine: what would it have been like if they appeared in a game that was good on its own merits?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the weak point of the original Dawn of War series. The new races aren't as fun as their predecessors and the air units change the entire scope of the game--it's just not balanced to deal with them. There's no point in having ground warfare and the other ninety percent of your arsenal when you can just fly huge groups of ships across the map and carpet-bomb everyone.

												If you've played any of the original Dawn of War, then you know what to expect with this game. This is the last expansion pack for Dawn of War and it adds some new tweaks and units to the existing races alongside with two new armies to play as:Sisters of Battle and Dark EldarThese two new additions are decent additions and rack up the total army list to 9, but the primary reason to get this expansion pack is to gain access to the slew of amazing mods online that have since moved on to Soulstorm. These mods include: Codex, Ultimate Apocalypse, and Dark Prophecy.Highly recommend getting this expansion pack if you're a fan of the original Dawn of War.			",187,14,4,15,10,0,38

												Enjoyed this game immensely. Had it on disc prior to owning it on steam, so I played it more than you think. The campaign is a bit lacking, with some bizarre voice acting here and there, but it does allow you to pick your favourite race and just go on a crusade (a dark crusade?) destroying everything else on every other planet in the game.That's just single player though, the real gem is multiplayer for this game. Fantastic array of races means that you have a chance to make an 8 player game where everybody is a different race! Each one has a different build style and slightly different strategy so If you enjoy RTS and like feeling unique in a game then this is for you. ",93,9,0,12,1,1,23

												Having very little experience of Warhammer 40,000 as a tabletop game, I am not going down the road of making any sort of analogy nor comparison. While it may be a strange idea to some, over the years I have had the constant barrage of ""Oh, it's nothing like the tabletop game, you know."" despite me not having claimed otherwise. Instead I will evaluate its merit as an RPG. I will note at this point that I have also played vanilla Dawn of War and the preceding expansions Winter Assault and Dark Crusade.On first coming to this game I found it very easy to pick up. With most races simply having the two basic resources, requisition and power, it was easy enough to settle into the tempo of gameplay. Requisition is collected by taking and holding control points (so no messy resource gathering) and power by building generators anywhere you control. The races each have their own distinct styles of warfare, but when broken down to basics they all follow the same pattern with unit types consistent across all races, so understanding what to make when and how to attack/counterattack is simple. However, the technology trees make advancement slightly different, and tactics must be adapted. Some races have unique benefits and requirements, such as the Orks requiring you to fill the Waaaaaargh! meter to progressively increase the population cap and develop improvements, or the Dark Eldar who gain powers as they consume the souls of fallen enemy troops. The differences make gameplay refreshing when playing as or against the different races.The battlefields themselves are well designed for balance (for skirmishes) or to challenge your leadership (for the campaign), with plenty of terrain variations that may help or hinder your troops advancement and survivability in a firefight. The environments too are well varied for visual and, to some extent, tactical enhancement with a healthy mix of wastelands, forests, swamps and cities from across the galaxy to whet your appetite. The campaign is reasonable, but not great, and sees you vying for control of a star system (I won't spoil it) against each of the other races. There are several tactical objectives that can even the odds before you invade a territory Risk-style should you take it. If you have played the Dark Crusade campaign then there's nothing much new with the cinematic-style endgame fights when you strike an enemy's capital, which are actually more structured scenarios than those of regular territory invasions, along with the obligatory cut-scenes.There's a decent amount of customisation available throughout, with the in-built Army Painter allowing you to do virtually what would take hours of laborious armwork and make a mess of your room/shed/garage. It has to be said, there is a certain sense of accomplishment seeing your custom flag being raised as you capture a control point. What I do find to be absent is a map editor, so in that respect customisation is a tiny bit limited, and the skirmish maps are all pre-built with no randomisation beyond your starting position (which makes little difference on a symmetrical-ish map).From a graphics standpoint the game is presented very well, with plenty of satisfying and beefy explosions, eerily beautiful plasma bolts and las beams flying around (The Baneblade in particular is especially good at showing these off) and, depending on your particular chipsets (mine not being too spectacular at the minute), the game is easily one of the prettier RTSs around, even now. The AI is decent, although bumbling on easier settings, and should provide a challenge to every skillset.In short;FOR : Simple to pick up, challenging to master. Custom armies. Good graphics, even by today's standards. Nice soundtrack.AGAINST : Limited customisation. Pre-built arenas. Not very engaging campaign (compared to previous iterations).Overall, despite its flaws, I would certainly reccomend you at least try this game. I find it to be enjoyable and quite addictive!

I play the boardgame and collecting an army for that game tends to be expensive.  This game kinda lets you try them out before making an investment.  The campaign game is also wonderful.

Acctually the more greater strategy game out in the markets and you won't be disappointed by it. I'll give it 3/5 because of the campaign, i expected more story movies and a bigger storyline for a game like Warhammer.			",96,9,0,7,12,0,19

I keep revisiting the original Dawn of War games because there are so few strategy games out there with so many factions, yet each one has a truely unique look and feel. Each faction has different units and it's really such an enjoyable experience every time I play. I think it really does the Warhammer Universe proud.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i have tried to get into this game, i really have and i love the dawn of war franchise but, this adition just feels hollow with the sisters of battle just being what feels like reskinned space marines with another currency mechanic but you know i still have dark crusade. its not that i dont want to like this game, i really do it's just that part of the fun for dawn of war for me was being able to watch the action from the viewpoint of your men but i just cant get that from this and seeing the different units running forwards or your assasin while he picked off eldar bone singers. but for some reason the camera is locked to be at least at a 45 degree angle so icant follow my men into battle or watch them fight hordes of orcs seemingly outnumeredwhile still fun im going to stay on dark crusade becuase adding a sky layer doesnt constitute much when your game is mostly focussed on ground combat. ♥♥♥♥ it im going to reccomend it becuase it is a dawn of war game and quite frankly i love the dawn of war games. so if you want more of the same, its here.

												I'm a die hard generals friend.  So when I first try this one I didn't care for it.  After I mode it I did in fact get back on and give this one a go.  You can see some of the modes for it on youtube and while at first they took me some tweeking to get to work I was happy I keep trying.  There are also a how to do for some of the modes for this one.  Check em out!   You might find a new love for a older game like I did			",73,25,0,87,43,0,72

												Did you find yourself playing the highly recommended Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, but wanting more? How about THREE TIMES AS LONG loading screens, and more pixellation of textures? Were you sick of all that adherence to canon and godlessly excellent characterization? Well THANK THE EMPEROR, HE HATH DELIVERED A GAME FOR YOU. It's the same game as Dark Crusade with the cool meta-map feature, but this time all the mission objectives are uninspired whenever they're not like pulling rotten teeth out of a screaming child's mouth. And the new air units are ""fun"" if you find ""poorly thought out, poorly balanced, obviously not designed for this engine"" things fun!The only reason to recommend this is that one of the two new factions you get to play as are Nun Space Marines with flamethrowers. I'm not going to pretend I didn't like playing as them, but imagine: what would it have been like if they appeared in a game that was good on its own merits?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good, not great, but good enough to play over and over (maybe 8.5/10). Soulstorm was one of the last time that DLC (or expansion as it was called back then) was truly worth it (instead of paying for hidden locked content so common these days). Still, it was not as revolutionary to the franchise as Dark Crusade was or even as good as the first game was.The Good:The 2 new factions feel distinct from the rest, especially with their special powers. The AI definitely had improved, especially in campaign (being used to the one in Dark Crusade, the AI did surprise me when I played the campaign - no more steamrolling with 3 Guardsmen squads on easy) and the balance has been somewhat restored (e.g. Space Marine Squad with max. 4 heavy weapons and Imperial Guard can now have 5 heavy weapons per squad).The Acceptable:I have conflicting feeling about the campaign. It was pretty much the same campaign like Dark Crusade, except on a planetary system but they introduced some fun innovations like the webway portal provinces, supply lines and stronghold bonuses - all which I strongly approve. But it wasn't long into the campaign before I realized how lazy the storytelling was; the dialogues were minimal (no more taunting in the beginning or after some objectives were completed in the Stronghold missions), awkward and stiff and the characters were forgettable at most. Some cutscenes were so poorly done that you wonder if they use first-year interns to do it.The Bad:Terrible voice acting that gave rise to the legend of METHUL BAWKSES, SPHESS MEHREENS and THE EMPRAH (although the new update restored the in-game voices to the good ones from Dark Crusade for some units (SM Force Commander has Thule's, Chaos Lord has Eliphas' [unfortunately they forgot to put Sindri back]), somewhat correcting this problem). Air units, which I was initially excited about, can really destroy the rebalanced gameplay; the Tau Barracuda can wreck an entire base on its own, the Ork Bomma is similarly devastating to infantry and Space Marines will only need the Land Speeder Tempest en masse).

												First off i am a huge fan of Warhammer 40k. That being said, soulstorm is a massive let down. They added two new races, the dark eldar and sisters of battle. Along with some new units for each race. The campagin is almost the same as the dark crusade, except for the lack of meat. Almost all the missions are search and destroy. The strongholds of the races are left wanting. Almost laughable, if it wernt for the fact that you had bought it..... If you're not a fan boy of these games, dont get it, if you are then you will get it anyway, to those people good luck and hopefully you get some enjoyment out of it.			",14,2,0,2,2,0,7

												Not a bad expansion.  Adds two new races, a new story mode.  Of the two new races i find the Dark Eldar more intresting. The Sisters of battle are pretty similar to Space Marines but with a high focus on short range weapons.  My only two main gripes with the expansion are that the computer A.I. will often try to build smaller secondary bases when on the run making battles take too long.  And the stronghold mission against the Sisters of battle is an unreasonable pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Its not hard just annoying because you have to destroy three statues while fending of a near invunerable Monsterous creature. That being said if you liked Dawn of War up to this point then this breaths in a few more hours of life into the game.			",224,104,1,29,12,2,44

												Although growing old in years, DoW is a landmark RTS and is the best WH40K game that has been made in terms of sheer content and variety. Whilst the campaign is lacklustre, having 9 races that play very differently is an incredible feat, backed up by just how much extra content you can find from the mod scene. The game was launched with ease of modding in mind and as such you can massively expand the game into the most comprehensive WH40K game that has ever been made, and possibly will ever be.

												One of the best RTS games I've played. Love the different factions and squad based gameplay. I especially like how you dont have to mine resources but instead capture strategic points on the map that give you resources and act as a forward outpost at the same time. Very good game to play with friends or skirmish the CPU. Campaign is a bit boring but gets the job done. Also the Apoc Mod is a must. The sheer amount of units and content is absolutely great!

												All in all, a great game, though how to work the Apocalypse mod is a mystery to me. . . have installed it but dosen't seem to work even though the first screen comes up with it. Also the Tyranid mod seems to not work, it has the control panel, but Tyranids don't appear in game. Don't know if its cause I installed UA first though or if its because I'm running this from a Mac on the Parallels emulator, couldn't tell you about the others. There is a 23-min Youtube vid on how to install it, but I dunno how to mess around with all the directories and stuff. The game itself is really good, would be nice if whoever picked up THQ could be bothered for No.3. And all the races this time please! I am in a work in progress on what units should be in 3 and will soon be posting it on 1d♥♥♥♥♥. I'm Vasari Vorastra Kultorask if anybody once to see my work on there. For the Tau'Va!

												Even though the Soulstorm is the worst of all the Expansions for DoW1, its community is the most active. Despite the fact the game has almost 10 years (2008) you can still find people playing online.The game is just great. Of copurse it has many flaws (mostly bugs) but the amount of advantages overcomes them. You have nine very unique races that are relatevily well balanced, multiple skirmish maps, average campagin, and still working multiplayer mode.I would advise to accquire and check out all DoW1 installments and use Soulstorm for multiplayer.

Sister on the other hand like fire and holy stuff and are just a bit weaker in hp and more specialised than space marines, so if your a fan of melting your foe to the bone use the sisters,A master crafted finale to what was already a Chapter relic of a game			",158,7,3,7,14,1,12

Although not much, players must do something different or differently to grow and sometimes also must adapt to the situation. Still it gives much fun and challenging gameplay. 10/10 to prepare yourselves to purge the heretics in the next upcoming game.			",68,17,1,12,8,3,25

												This game in itself is very mediocre. It's an alright game, worth the money, and it can keep you entertained for a few hours. The campaign itself didn't really do it for me, the first DoW campaign was way better. Skirmish is really fun though.The balance between the races are really broken. The Tau for example don't have turrets or mines, so though they have a strong offence, their defence is is lacking and unless you constantly have an army at your disposal you're pretty much doomed. The IG is pretty much overpowered as their soldiers may be weak, but there are a lot of them, and they're quick to train and cheap as well.If you download and install the Ultimate Apocalypse mod however, this game instantly becomes a masterpiece. It fixes all problem (or most) such as the lack of turrets for the tau, and they even created their very own models! Combine it with the Tyranid mod and you get tyranids as an additional army, though I personally don't enjoy them too much.Highly recommended.			",19,4,0,2,5,0,10

												Bought this to finish off my collectionand it finishes the series perfectley, balancing issues, map tweaks, finally able to attach my chaplain to my terminators,Of the new races (sisters of battle and dark eldar(emo elves)) the d eldar are the weakest, having low hp and average dps, so they have fast hit and run style transports and jump troops. Sister on the other hand like fire and holy stuff and are just a bit weaker in hp and more specialised than space marines, so if your a fan of melting your foe to the bone use the sisters,A master crafted finale to what was already a Chapter relic of a game			",158,7,3,7,14,1,12

												A lot of people know Soulstorm by ""SPESS MEHREENS"", ""METAL BAWKSES"" and such. And in all fairness, if there was one thing I would critique Soulstorm for other than lack of polish, it is occasionally train-wreck level off-kilter VA work.However, occasional VA disaster aside, I would consider Soulstorm a flawed, yet still highly interesting gem. The campaign system, while no larger than Dark Crusade's, is deeper from the introduction of Webway travel and a better slew of racial bonuses on the campaign map (no more Necrons with Fury nonsense  on Turn 1, looking at you, DC) and both the new races are at the least of a different variety to the others in the game with viable differing strategies. The introduction of flyers adds at least in part another element of power-play to the game by acting as an extra combat element on the attack and the defence. Would I recommend Soulstorm for £40? No. But for the asking price offered, I would absolutely encourage people to round out the DoW 1 collection and see what Soulstorm has to offer. You might be as surprised as me.

												One of these games are not like the others... in a bad way.The DoW series has always had a different style of Campaign for each one and they were fun. This one has a terrible story (by any standard) and the campaign brings nothing new to the table but the kind of disappointment you get when you realise that the introduced airplanes into the mix and ♥♥♥♥ed them up so they act like a ground unit. We're not talking Landspeed things, we are talking aircraft. They added Dark Eldar (was exited) and the Sisters of Battle(didnt know much lore about them). They ♥♥♥♥ed up the balancing between races and completely rendered the Necrons and Orks as almost unplayable. Everyone talks about how great the DoW series was, and I agree it was AMAZING. But their was one expansion that killed it for me and everyone I know and it was this game right here. I just wished people played Dark Crusade more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And so it was that the foe who had once knew no fear, looked on in terror as the emperors own angels of death did descend from the heavens upon wings of fire. To wash clean the world, in the cleansing flames of the Emperors righteous fury. To bring battle to all who would not hear his holy word, and to deliver unto them his divine vengeance. For the foe now knew all too well, that there would be no mercy, no respite, no hope. For in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium.... There is only war!  But in all seriousness, this is a good old school rts game with solid gameplay, and a army painter to boot. I have alot of fun playing it, and it's even better with friends.			",94,15,2,9,12,0,26

												There is but one thing that I must disagree with in this game, and that is the incredibly low perspective. It nearly leaves my eyes sore staring at my screen too long, and yet I still find myself pouring hours into the game. There is just something so captivating to me about painting an army to my specific tastes, then sending them to battle against a cornucopia of different enemies, be it the long-range Tau or the resilient and slow moving Necrons, the game does well to offer variety in nearly every regard. There are nine seperate factions to play as, each is very independant of the other, and rarely is something ever copied or re-used. The voice acting is especially well done, and be it the cry for help or a taunt thrown towards the enemy, each line is spoken with skill and care for the character they are representing. I do, in fact, prefer the previous DLC, Dawn of War: The Dark Crusade's campaign, but then the multiplayer in any RTS game I have ever played has never felt quite as different as this specific title. Finally, I must say that if you are looking for an strategy game with serious a range of different factions with recognizable similarities, then there may be no better title that Dawn of War: Soulstorm. Thank you for reading, and best of days for you.			",51,8,0,11,9,0,13

												It's like dark crusade only..... well to be frank really badI've enjoyed the dawn of war games immensely, but this one is incredibly unpolished with a completely lackluster campaign mode that strips away what made the dark crusade campaigns so much fun. I highly recommend this game, if only for the excellent ultimate apocalypse mod, but otherwise....... unfortunately I can't recommend it. Buy the dark crusade expansion or the base game instead as they are FANTASTIC^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wether your playing this game as a standalone or playing with the base games it will give you hours of playtime. Even so it is best played with the core game and the Winter assault and Dark Crusade expansions.Pros:- Good selection of playable factions. - Decent amount of maps of varying sizes.- Cood campaign that is semi-linear allowing you to choose which battles you play depending on which faction you choose.- Each faction has its own play style, strenghts, and weaknesses.- Can make your own colour schemes for use in skirmish and multiplayer modes.Cons:- Most of the factions have a very rigid playstyles.- Some factions have limited or nearly no counters to others so are easily defeated. (Stealth being the worst offender for some of the factions)- Campaign isn't really a story, but more a multi-battle system with a back story for each faction's involvement.			",94,17,3,20,19,3,57

												Warhammer 40,000. This universe is where dreams come true in the form of bloodshed and misery! Enjoy the fleeting moments of silence as you gaze into the Fog Of War and suddenly, a Bloodthirster bull-rushes your men and tosses them into the air, using them for human baseballs (No, really, they do). Call upon your Predator tanks and yet you still cannot best this beast, when suddenly, your Force Commander charges in, holy hammer swinging, and jumps onto the beast's head and rides it into submission, then pounds it back into the underworld (Warp) ((Also happens, seriously, you can witness this)) Or... you could use the powers of the Warp yourself (And the powers of ModDB) to gain the advantage and send in more Bloodthirsters! (Seriously the No Limit mod makes this game that much more fun) The total anarchy of the combat and the brutality of the 'Sync-Kills' make up for the lack of up-to-date graphics. You REALLY need this game, or get Dark Crusade! Just don't get the older ones, not worth the money unless you want the story. GET. THIS. Game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of these games are not like the others... in a bad way.The DoW series has always had a different style of Campaign for each one and they were fun. This one has a terrible story (by any standard) and the campaign brings nothing new to the table but the kind of disappointment you get when you realise that the introduced airplanes into the mix and ♥♥♥♥ed them up so they act like a ground unit. We're not talking Landspeed things, we are talking aircraft. They added Dark Eldar (was exited) and the Sisters of Battle(didnt know much lore about them). They ♥♥♥♥ed up the balancing between races and completely rendered the Necrons and Orks as almost unplayable. Everyone talks about how great the DoW series was, and I agree it was AMAZING. But their was one expansion that killed it for me and everyone I know and it was this game right here. I just wished people played Dark Crusade more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have racked up over 180 hours on the steam version, but take into account that I've had the game longer than I've had a steam account. The finall expansion came out in 2008 and Here I am still playing it all these years later. The game is also supported by amazing mod teams that make the experience 10 times better. So get this game and get your friends to get it to and you will have hours of fun!			",55,0,0,7,10,0,33

												Still works to this day. The graphics are dated (obviously), and the size of the HUD vs. the size of the workable space kinda sucks, but otherwise this game is a pretty fun (and punishing if you are bad like me) game. The AI will cheat in singleplayer however, but it makes the games a lot harder (same difficulty in a 1v1 skirmish is a one sided stomp even for me), and you can get yourself to a pretty steamrolling state if you're good and quick at the campaign.For the Emprah!

												Amazing game i played all the expansion back in the day and just got SS on steam for kicks now. i reccomend the Ultamit apoculyps mod to go with this game. the game is a bit older so dont suspect to much from the graphics department but all in all it does look good IMO. the story was fun the races was decently balanced and the game play was down right fun. why in the world did they change it up in DOW 2 i well never know (not saying i dont like DOW 2 but i really missed my base building bro.)

												While playing the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod, one of my titans stepped on two tanks and six squads of infantry.On a serious note, the game has amazing gameplay and will provde you with endless hours of fun. The Ultimate Apocalypse Mod makes it that much better. Of course it's an older game, so the graphics reflect this, but i can't fault the game for this.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this to finish off my collectionand it finishes the series perfectley, balancing issues, map tweaks, finally able to attach my chaplain to my terminators,Of the new races (sisters of battle and dark eldar(emo elves)) the d eldar are the weakest, having low hp and average dps, so they have fast hit and run style transports and jump troops. Sister on the other hand like fire and holy stuff and are just a bit weaker in hp and more specialised than space marines, so if your a fan of melting your foe to the bone use the sisters,A master crafted finale to what was already a Chapter relic of a game			",158,7,3,7,14,1,12

												DOWSS recap - Updated tutorial help a little but neeed to be more helpful im still loseing 1v1s games and i have had much experience it should be more delatiled give more helpful tips.-Still experienceing broken shift clicking on br which has not been fixed which makes me lose resources costing games for years.sob and dark eldar good aditions ( sob new resource system and bikes and fast attack unit for dark eldar)-Air units added not untilised well with maps.Not 100% perfect on a scale of difficulty in executeing everything corectly and what they delivered on release was not perfect. It was riddled with errors. There is basicly not much of a difference bettween ss and dc. Some good maps were added i like the variety it help with each different way you would like to play the game qs and std ect. It effect the mindframe which in turn makes your mood good which i find quite strange it seems for a game with so much destructuion and killing how this works i dont understand. Compeditively there are a variety of builds some are completely overpowered which makes the game slightly stressful without the focus on improveing and need for more experience or playtime and learn more specfic tactics and with this the effort that would take would not be worth it. The game is fun but more need to be done to the game that could have made it more worth playing i could play 100s of game that are fun but need it needs to be more benficial in some way more then just a game i play as a hobby.That said i still i like this game it is not a negative review and  i am trying to be constructive in my post so if you read this and dont like what i have said you could simple ignore it or pass it. That said though the game was good i meet some great poeple playing this game and friendships one of the factors that brought me back the game and chaos is an interesting race for some strange reason its taken a likeing to me.8/10 multiplayer.5/10 singleplayer.

												The penultimate entry in the Dawn of War One sub-series, Soulstorm offers a freeform campaign much like Dark Crusade, but has vast improvements along with the two new factions being thrown into the mix. The ""special"" ability regions of Dark Crusade are now bundled in with the Strongholds, making them far more important and freeing up the land to hold more varied honor guard units.In regards to the battles, every faction has gained a new unit. The Necrons have gained access to another god, The Deciever, while everyone else has gained a flying unit (Attack Scarabs becoming one) capable of flying over any terrain at high speeds while melee units shake their sluggas towards the sky in frustration.

												Warhammer 40K: Dawn of  War - Soulstorm is the third and last standalone expansion to the 1st game.In this expac the factions ""Dark Eldar"" and ""Sister's of Battle"" where added rounding up the roster  to a wopping 9 factions.It also brings some ballance and unit changes.However the part that elevates Soulstorm over Dark Crusade for me is the ultimate apocalypse mod wich adds soo much to the game.Definately a must have for all strategy lovers.

												My favorite RTS of all time. Don't get the wrong impression by my game time, I've played it for years until I could finally buy it. It has great atmospheric, the battles feel huge and impactful, and the immersion is really impressive, mostly accomplished by the scream of the factions at wars in the middle of combat. Dawn Of War got me into Warhammer 40k, so even if you don't know the lore, you can still have a great time playing this amazing RTS.			",77,8,0,9,7,0,13

												Even though the Soulstorm is the worst of all the Expansions for DoW1, its community is the most active. Despite the fact the game has almost 10 years (2008) you can still find people playing online.The game is just great. Of copurse it has many flaws (mostly bugs) but the amount of advantages overcomes them. You have nine very unique races that are relatevily well balanced, multiple skirmish maps, average campagin, and still working multiplayer mode.I would advise to accquire and check out all DoW1 installments and use Soulstorm for multiplayer.

												Still one of the best RTS games out there, the original Dawn of War clearly qualifies for the ""Test of Time"" award, and still provokes hours of balance arguments!Its classic base-building RTS gameplay means there's plenty of scope to come back from intial losses and with each race over- or under-powered at different points in their tech trees, multiple strategies prove viable. 9 different armies with slightly differing mechanics provide plenty of different matchup combinations, and the modding scene has fixed the worst of the bugs and improved the AI to the point where it can put up a credible opposition.

												I Really like this game, A LOT! Storming the battlefield with space marines or blowing open chaos with tau plasma fire is great fun, my only complaint is that the zoomout for the base game is not good, and doesn't represent the scale I think relic was going for. However, there is a mod to add additional camera zoomout.Along with the zoomout mod, there is another mod which is the main reason I have played this game for over 500 hours is Ultimate Apocalypse, a glorious addition to Soulstorm which adds in three new races (adding up to 12 races counting the 9 ones already in the game, and the 3 new ones in UA) and many, many new units and even titans! Along with this, the ability to zoom out much farther is very nice. Especially for me, as I am a player who loves to use artillery such as basilisks or whirlwinds, and the extra zoomout range can help you see what exactly you are shooting at. Overall The expansion itself is great, with the multi-planet campaign and adding in the Sisters of Battle and Dark Eldar, the one problem I have with this expansion, and game as a whole is the zoomout and the fact that many of the smaller maps don't give you enough room to build your base up properly, bringing the game down to a 9/10. With mods though, you can play this game for hours (as I have) and with UA in particular, I give this game a 10/10. In fact, I might be playing this game right now.			",47,2,0,2,3,0,16
