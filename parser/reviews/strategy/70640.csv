												There are so many versions of Worms out there but the original is the one with---*Less cartoony graphics - pixel art here instead of smooth cartoons.*Fewer items - you have a good selection of weapons, but the most exotic items are the exploding sheep and banana bomb - no Holy Hand Grenade, Carpet Bomb or jet pack in this version.*Less polish - sound effects are fuzzy and the menus are a bit unwieldy.*Worse AI - computer characters never use ropes, spam the teleport awkwardly, get stuck behind cover and never ever miss with ranged weapons.But--Some (me) would say that the original game is superior to 'Worms 2' and every edition since then, most of which are esentially inferior clones or inconsequential tweaks to the sequel. The original is special. Its dated look and feel have aged respectably rather than stagnated (the bright coloured candy canes and bug eyes of Worms 2 look a bit naff today wheras the detailed, carefully-drawn objects here still look wonderful - see the Satan statues straight out of Shadow of the Beast).The smaller selection of weapons make the game more strategic and engaging, allowing it to retain an element of skill and a rising tension. And this version alone retains a great sense of fun and exploration that the many rehashes seem to replace with cynicism.Only in the original 'Worms' will you find a huge collection of gorgeous, hand-drawn custom stages that smash into pixels when you play on them, or a lovely, extremely 90's full-length re-mix of the theme tune hidden in the options menus. And only here will your worms shout 'suck on this' in a silly voice before shooting a pair of 'wanted criminals' named Robson and Jerome in the face with an uzi. With their last ounce of strength. On the Statue of Liberty. With a worm's face on it. This version has heart!			",5,3,0,2,0,0,1

												Come on, Worms surely needs no introduction, right? If you aren't familiar with this game, you're either too young to have had the pleasure of playing it or simply unfortunate enough to never get around to it. Truly a masterpiece of a game for it's time, this is the game that put Team 17 on the map and strengthened their reputation as a company. Despite it's revolutionary past, Worms hasn't really stood well against the test of time, it hasn't aged very well at all, unlike it's sequel series of games  (Worms 2, Worms Armageddon, Worms World Party) which are timeless and still loads of fun to play to this day. I'd still recommend picking up the original Worms for the nostalgia value, despite DosBox being a nightmare to work with on modern machines. If you are new to the series however, I would advise picking up Worms Armageddon instead, it is vastly superior and has been updated over the course of time to compensate for modern computers.

												Do i really need to give much information here?No, it's not what comes out yer dogs♥♥♥♥♥♥or what you get from eating frozen chips. It's Worms!Probably one of the funnest turn based games i have ever played with a few friends. Controls are a bit annoying at first, and i guarentee a load of misfires! But this is what makes the game better.Don't get me wrong, the graphics are a bit outdated (especially maybe for the younger audience), it runs in DosBox and runs in a low resolution! But the music is great, the fun gained from this is amazing and for the older players out there, the nostalgia is wonderful.Seeing you blow up 'Bob' by accident when you fire instead of jump and hearing the snidey remark said by your troubled little worm, is quite possibly one of the most theraputic things i have ever encountered. ""Oh Dear!""If you have NEVER played worms... Go eat a holy hand grenade.But seriously....(If not on full price, seeing as this game is 20 years old) Get this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When I started it up I was instantly back 10-15 years in the past, created a team and started playing with my brother. There are so many friends that I have to call now to play this with them again!

Silly accents and the triumphant swell of pride when, finally, the last of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s is in your sights, and you are a squeeze of the trigger away from avenging your fallen comrades.

												This is how this legendary series started. In 2016, after SO MANY YEARS, this game isn't probably best choice for session with friends. I mean, people loved Worms Armageddon, Worms World Party is my favorite Worms games, new players are probably in love with Worms Reloaded or Revolutions. First Worms game can be only played out of curiousity, how this all started. Older players for sure love first Worms and play it once in a while but nobody else will spend days playing it. It was my first time in two years (and first time on Steam) since I played Worms. Didn't spend much time but had my dose of nostalgia. Team17 had great idea for game and even with using same scheme in every next game (except spin-offs) they are making every next Worms game better and more fun. Old Worms works fine on modern computers and, at least in my case, didn't had any trouble running and playing it.Thank you Team17 for starting such a great series, (almost) never dissapointing. For many this game is priceless but if you ever played any Worms game and want to see how it all started, grab it at some sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played this on the Sega Saturn several years ago. Already familiar with its immediate (and infinitely more refined) sequels, Worms 2 and Armageddon, I was mostly unimpressed. I revisited it on Steam with the assumption that I’d half-heartedly play a game or two, exit to desktop and write up a review labelling it “Not Recommended,” partly because it’s been made obsolete by newer instalments and partly because it just wasn’t much fun to begin with. Not quite. Whether it’s because the Steam version is more enhanced than the Saturn port, or simply because of something I missed the first time round, I find that there’s much more entertainment to be had with the original Worms than I remembered. I expected a barely-functioning prototype to the classic Worms formula presented in Worms 2 and perfected in Worms Armageddon, but in reality it’s a solid turn-based strategy that holds up surprisingly well and, just as importantly, manages to retain its own unique flavour, distinct from any of the titles that followed it. For a 20-year-old game running on a slightly shaky version of DosBox*, it looks and sounds fantastic. There’s a lot of detail in each themed environment, every inch of which can be destroyed by the usual high-impact weapons you’d expect to find in a Worms title. It’s an impressive achievement for 1995, and one that has obvious implications on gameplay. The worms themselves look a little worse, 8-bit sprites against a backdrop that appears to have evolved without them, yet there’s a certain something in their choppy animations that, in addition to slightly awkward but otherwise well-meaning FMV clips, lends to the overall light-hearted, cartoon feel of the game. That, and a wide variety of voice banks that see your team speaking in anything from hyperactive American to thick Norwegian. The gameplay itself will be familiar to anyone who’s ever played a Worms game - take turns navigating purposefully cumbersome worms across a dangerous terrain, utilising increasingly dangerous weaponry to, you know, destroy all enemies - and in this original release it works remarkably well. Some gameplay tweaks from future instalments are missing here - once you begin to fire a bazooka, for instance, you cannot change its trajectory at the last minute. Inconsistencies in the A.I. are also present - at times, computer-controlled worms freeze for the duration of their turn; other times, they fire missiles and throw grenades with accuracy that guarantees a perfect hit. Worms has always been best enjoyed with other people, however, and that doesn’t change here. This is not the best Worms game - in fact, it may well be the weakest of the original 2D titles. But as the precursor to one of the best (if a little tired) multiplayer series ever devised, it’s well worth giving a shot, no matter how familiar you are with other instalments. And if you can allow for its flaws, there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself sticking with the original Worms for more than one round. *There are some hoops to jump through in getting Worms to run on Windows 8.1, and probably a bunch of other operating systems. Fortunately the solution is mostly straightforward, and can be found in Steam's community hub.			",26,16,2,3,0,2,9

												This legendary, classic gem brings back many happy childhood memories. Although it's not the best/most complex episode - Armageddon/WWP exceeds it, of course - it's still great, especially for its age. The unique weapons and various creative levels are compensating the somewhat poor AI, and the classic ""Worms feeling"" makes it worth at least a try.(and not to mention that the original Wormsong is still one of the best game musics ever composed)			",473,175,13,96,59,7,90

But is it worth the £4.99 maybe not, its very outdated now, the videos are poor and have not been processed correctly maybe but pixals none the less and it is not visually great no updates or tweeks, not at all smoothed out and on bigger or widescreens it will be glaring and obvious to see.But still a great game none the less and will not spoil my memories of my sister managing to throw a banana bomb down my tunnel network and killing my worms in one hit that was amazing. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game requires DOSBOX, sounds like a rip-off of money, eh? But I still buy it because it's classic, that's all. I bought the whole collection on Steam long time ago, this Worms is not an inferior version comparing to its sequels.In retrospect, it perfectly illustrates what exactly is masterpiece. Having been playing Worms series for at least 15 years, they never make me feel jaded however. Instead, I still play it on my phone, pad, and Xbox. About this oldest pixel Worms, my advice is, if you are not familiar with DOSBOX or, not from DOS era, don't play this, grow some pubes first and play other Worms instead, because they are pretty famous on mobile platfrom, lots of young people know its siblings like Reloaded from Symbian as well, you can easily get used to the control.Many people dislike pixel games because modern games have greatly advanced graphics, but most of modern games are just for fastfood culture, in another word, one-offs. Worms are not disposable, you will immediately enjoy it, and the delights will endure in your heart for a long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your first taste of Worms was on the PlayStation, good news! This is more or less identical to the PSone version.This version of the game is actually ""Worms: United"", a compilation containing the original game and the ""Reinforcements"" expansion pack. If recent entries in the series have left you disappointed, I'd recommend picking this up, though keep in mind GOG.com has it for about $2 less.			",242,64,3,29,15,3,49

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pieDirections:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I spent about $1.50 on this game and I can only think I wasted my money.Take note that all of the gushing reviews are after 0.1 hrs play and all talk about how it was great in the day.Don't get me wrong, this version works well and if you REALLY liked the first game it's still the same, but the series got better after his.AVOID, buy the more up to date versions.

												trying to calculate how far or high a weapon flies and apply wind speed and direction is WAY more difficult here than worms armageddon, land mines are practically invisible, in challenge mode you'll come across a completely ASININE mission that cannot be conquered! it's basically just a level where you can send your worms to their doom as they get obliterated into non-existance one hit at a time, no matter where on the map they are, even if you're deep underground. all you can really use is a bazooka and that's IF you can hit them at all. here's the password for the satanic unwinnable mission 15, ""good bye"" ( pager call for the grim reaper there ) apply the space between good and bye. over all, this game is WAY tougher than it looks, not meant for kids because they are not ready to play a game this intense. you need precision, patience and high gaming skill to hit tiny targets with tiny weapons, it's too much like playing golf then going to war, especially when nearly every weapon is taken away from you when you play challenge mode, what else can you do? oh yeah, did i forget to mention that the unwinnable level doesn't let you have any ammunition but a bazooka to fight back with?! i have to say the only thing about this game i really like is the animated cutscenes before the start of a match. one of the evil games of 95, i wouldn't recommend this game unless you were something else.

												Worms is a 2D 90s game where you play as a worm that can lob all sorts of artillery power against all of your worm enemies. Other than playing this game for nostalgia reason, there is no other reason for anyone to be playing this. Worms reloaded is available on steam and is infinitely better. If you are looking for some good old classic games, was too young to know about worms in ‘95, or was living under a rock in ’95 and didn’t get a chance to play this then have a go at this game in the 21st century. Multiplayer is local so you can still have some fun with some friends. Overall I would recommend against getting this game. Like yearly sports game, why would you play the older product?

												This game is a classic for any worms fan, but:- Too bad there isn't an offline singleplayer mode. - It has an average offline 2 player. I think there are better worms games out there.   => Worms armageddon has a better graphical quality, for instance. - This game runs on DOSbox.- The cutscenes before starting a game, are very bad and even have lags in them.Only buy this game if you are a fan of the worms series, or when you want to relive/play classic pc games. Otherwise I advice you to stay away from this game OR buy another (better) game of the worms series.Thank you for reading & feel free to check out my other reviews.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Differences?PC version have pixelz - Amiga version have nice graphics with styleSounds on PC version are terrible.There is no problem with HD space today but why this game required ~321MB?They should sell original/unmodified copies from Amiga, ported, not strange crappy♥♥♥♥♥♥(check out SuperFrog HD).Anyway, it's still a good old game - this version just ruin my memories.You should better buy Armageddon - it's good old-new game too. Reloaded - good version, just like Worms World Party, or Revolution - newest Worms, 2D with very nice graphics.			",206,37,14,41,39,1,59

If you are a fan of this game series, and feel wanting to distract yourself for some minutes, or just playing with a friend in the same room in a retro way, this is the game for you. This game is emulated through DOSBox but it runs at 100%. If possible buy this if you catch it on sales (2,50€ or less), 6€ is a little too much for the extremely short longevity.			",23,7,0,6,3,1,8

												Nothing like the first game of Worms.I would like it if programs included with the download (such as BANKEDIT and CONVERT) could be used.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good game whether you played it back in the 90s and want nostalgia or are new to the worms series and want to see what they came up from. It's a good game, but i'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game pretty much plays like any other worms game just it has terrible graphics. Can you blame it though? It was made in 1995. So for the reasons of it being the first worm game and being revolutionary gets a thumbs up for me. P.S. The cutscenes are awful			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worms is a classic, old skool strategy game where the basic objective is to take out the other team using whatever weapons, traps etc. are avalible to you. Its a lot of fun, but better being played with a friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
