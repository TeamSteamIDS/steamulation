												Excelent game! Time just flies playing it. It's simple, fun and insures hours of gameplay. Theres also several different scenarios with different challenges to try and complete.One thing must be noted however, if there is too many train tracks/trains/stations out in the world, the game is going to crash to desktop since it only supports upto 2gb memory no matter how much memory is installed on your system.There is a simple fix for this however, download the Sid Meiers Railroads 3GBEnabler[smrsimple.com] and follow the instructions. It removes the 2gb limit and my game hasn't crashed once since.Definitely recommend the game after the crash fix is applied. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very nice Tycoon game. Its similar to the Railroad Tycoon series. Maybe a little bit more casual gaming.You need to produce goods and deliver from A to B and have an eye for the Money.In the internet you would find more maps for that game. For a game released in 2006 it has nice lovely graphics and wonderful melodies.It's worth it.Attention: On Windows 8 64 bit Edition it will crashed and only work with a modified GameDate file. And the online multiplayer does not work anymore!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sid Meier's Railroads! is the first train tycoon game I've ever played. I don't know why; tycoon games are one of my favorite subgenres of simulation games, and I love any games having to do with transportation of any type, from cars to ships to farming equipment. In saying that, know that this review is from someone who loves the genre and trains despite being relatively new to the railroad management subset.Sid Meier's Railroads! is a game that kept pleasantly surprising me. I went into this game figuring I would be building trains and connecting the tracks to various destinations. I hadn't known it would be this in depth, and yet so easy to learn. The game and its userface is extremely user friendly, and it has a short tutorial to teach you the basics. Everything else is figured out by playing scenarios. Since I was brand new to this type of game, I began by selecting a multiplayer map but electing to play first on my own so I could figure things out. That's when I realized that even when not playing competitively, this game is a ton of fun.You start out by having a city with a small track already built that you can build off of (also, all maps can be randomized, so playing through on the same maps over and over again is different every time). You need to then decide where to go from there. Different cities request different products, and you can deliver it to them from either suppliers or other cities. This gets to be a little more in depth because you can end up having a multiple step process to have one train deliver products to various cities (for example, Train A can be set up to pick up corn from a farm supplier, deliver it to City A, City A will then convert corn to food, Train A will take food to City B, etc.). You can also have trains deliver passengers and mail from city to city. Over the course of history, trains are unlocked that have better performance. It's extraordinarily simple to upgrade these trains to better trains that have been unlocked, and all without hindering its route. This is essentially the type of gameplay you can expect. To make things more interesting, however, depending on what cities and products you decide to utilize, cities and suppliers will grow to supply your demand and vice versa. By growing, suppliers can supply more resources and more quickly, while cities may be able to hold stock of more resources while space opens up where you can build your own industries. Cities will also request supplies from time to time, offering a cash reward for a certain product. These are some of the reasons that playing a fairly long game refrains from being boring; options are constantly opening up for you. Competitive mode with the AI is also fun, though I prefer the single player building aspect better myself. With the AI, they will do all the things you do, building tracks, causing cities and suppliers to grow, etc. The difference here is that you are obviously competing for the goal you have set, while also having the option to buy stock in your competitors and eventually merge or liquidate their company by completely buying them out--provided you have enough money.While this game has been a blast (it makes me regret not trying a railroad management game before this), it does have its problems. On modern systems (I have Windows 7 64bit, for example) the game begins to crash once a good amount of railroads and trains have been built. The game is set by default to restrict itself to using only 1 GB of RAM, and once you've been in a game for a half hour or so, it will surpass this and begin crashing to the desktop. HOWEVER, there are fixes for this (see the community forums). I downloaded a .exe file from http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Railroads! that fixed everything, and haven't had a crash since. Also, the game is set by default to autosave, which saves your game every 60 seconds. Needless to say, even when it was crashing, I'd simply start it right back up and be just seconds away from where I was.In summary, this game is an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone, particularly simulation, tycoon, and management fans. I haven't been so instantly engrossed in a game in quite some time. I'm so happy I found this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Upon installing Sid Meier's Railroads, I was immediately taken by the game's intuitive design and the straightforward interface. This way, players are given a chance to enjoy the game and its numerous traits, regardless of their previous experiences with train sims. So, all it takes is going through the simplified 5-minute tutorial, and you should be ready for the challenges that come with the game's single-player and multiplayer modes. Sid Meier's Railroads boasts a unique way of allowing the player to get into the game as quickly and easily as possible. In addition, several single-player scenarios are on offer as well as a range of well-designed multiplayer maps.Firaxis managed to disregard any aspects of the gameplay that could burden the player or create unwanted micromanagement issues. Also, there's a choice of over 30 different industries to purchase and organize, 20 resources to manage and over 30 unique train models to produce and utilize. Each scenario revolves around completing a wide range of tasks, after which you can look forward to many cool bonuses - thus improving your cash balance and instituting a more stable economy for future endeavors.Looking at the graphics, Sid Meier's Railroads includes just about everything you can hope to find in a train-sim. Realistic and colorful surroundings and detailed locomotive models manage to capture the player's eye almost straight away. As your very own mass transit system begins to take shape, you'll be able to acknowledge the developer's admirable attention to detail. In closing, this game is catchy and has a little something for everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an enjoyable game, in principle, but it's just too crash-happy.  In five hours of play, it must have crashed over 15 times for me, and it can get itself caught in such a state that even though you can re-load autosaves, it'll keep crashing at the same point, effectively ending that particular playthrough.Edit: As pointed out below, the game issues are likely primarily an age rather than coding/QA thing (although there are still issues with train routing that are a code, not compatibility thing).  That said, would recommend a high degree of caution before playing this game on more modern system.s			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SMR! is one of my favorit games. I had bought a copy way back in 2005 or 06 and played the crap out of it until the disk was destroyed. I was pretty excited when I found it on Steam. And then I discovered that 2K Games decided to throw a ""classic"" up with out patching it to work on modern machines. While there is a patch created by a player to make it work (most of the time) I still cant recommend purchasing this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a big fan of simulation games and a model railroader, games which combine the two interests are often quickly added to my collection. Soon after Sid Meier;s Railroads! came out, I purchased it on disk, and played it a pretty good bit. I enjoyed it, but found it rather cartoony and unrealistic, especially compared to earlier titles in the series (Railroad Tycoon 1, 2 & 3.) I also found that your railroad builds up way too quickly and you end up making more money than you could use after about an hour or so on a map. Also the maps are incredibly undersized, and in a matter of a couple hours, you can't build another line because there's nowhere to build it to, from, or across!Railroads! is rather fun, but I completely lose interest in a map after a couple hours because there's nothing left to do. The scenerios are easy, quick and too few, steam locomotives never have tenders (which just looks wrong on most engines), and there are many features from older versions that are completely abandoned!So a quick breakdown:Pros:-More approachable for beginners-Good for quick games, unlike older versions-Great opening cinematic-More approachable for non-railroaders-Very approachable stock marketCons:-Little content-Unrealistic-Over-simplified-Maps are far too small-No tenders on steam engines-Poorly balanced-Maps take less than a couple hours to lose their entertainment valueSo my feeling is that if you want a casual Tycoon game, this is for you, but if you're a hardcore Tycoon, try Railroad Tycoon 2 or 3. (My favorite from the series is 2)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sid Meier's Railroads! is old - but still one of the best train sandbox games that there is today.  If you've played games like Transport Tycoon (Deluxe) and Railroad Tycoon (or any of its 2 sequels), then this is a must game for you.  It's a typical Sandbox style build up a rail empire type game with many fun and challenging scenarios.  There is an issue running this game on 64 bit operating systems where the game will crash with an exception error, but this can be easily fixed by applying a 3 GB memory patch which is very well documented on fan sites which exist for the game (use Google) - other than that, it's a game which will give you many hours of entertainment.I need to point out that this is not a train simulator - you do not get to drive the actual trains.I also prefer this game a lot more over Cities in Motion (if you've played it) because it doesn't require as much micro-management.  You build the track, add the trains, tell it what routes to take and what cargo, and off you go! The only additional management you need to do is upgrade your trains as new engines become available.Most enjoyable, and worth the few bob.  I am yet to find another game which is this game's equal or successor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am however diapointed by its frequent crashes  in both single player and more so multiplayer, which keep us from enjoying a long game. I wish it could be fixed. While I can still recommend this title in its current state due to its fine and fun though short gameplay, I can't help but wonder what may have been if they had done a better job during their debug period while developing it... It could have been something special, a franchise even.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always loved business simulations and the kid version of me loves trains. Even though I have both of those things in me, I just didn't like the thought of a railroad tycoon type of game even if it is from the great Sid Meier.After playing it though, its an enjoyable little game with a competitive element (if you chose). You chose the era to start and era to end the game. The game basically consists of you connecting resources, supply and demand. Resources get generated, such as oil, grapes, crops, livestock, minerals and so on. Then you connect them to towns that need them. A town will have one of three things demanding these resources. You setup the tracks, then make a train route to bring them in. It is just that simple. The towns will grow into cities. When they take the resources, based on what buildings they have, such as livestock and crops will turn into food. Minerals will turn into gold and so on. Then you export them to other towns that need them. The towns will grow into cities and get more buildings and need more resources for you to bring them. New towns will generate too.The real twist here is a competitive element (if you have AI opponents). Even in single player, you can have up to 3 AI opponents (or no competition). A game of Monopoly really. You can buy stock in the other companies. You can sell your own stock for money. You don't just get money doing routes. You also get money buying facilities in towns and cities. However, when you try to buy them, you'll end up bidding against the AI competition if you have any. You can also construct facilities yourself for a flat fee if there are any available lots in a town or city. This means, you can play Monopoly and never actually build a railroad. There's a buzz buying out your competition, but I never really felt all that threatened by them, even with all of their tracks around me. The twist of having stock and buying buildings makes the game a lot of fun in a game that wouldn't warrant replays. It is always the same map, BUT there is an option to randomize the land and cities which is very nice.With all of that said, its a fun, relaxing, yet competitive game (if you have AI or do multi-player), but the only downside is, there's not much variety here. Once you've played one full game, you've played it all. There are victory conditions, but they're not front and center, so there's no focus on it. At $10, if you're into Monopoly style games, or railroading in general, give it a go. Otherwise, wait for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fun, especially with kids.Unfortunately, it is absolutely ruined by the instablity in late-game when the system of bridges/tunnels/tracks gets more complex. The game runs track layout simulations in real time to indicate what the completed track would look like and cost, and that's usually when the crashes happen. It is absolutely game-breaking.Do not buy this game until they fix the instability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT - THERE IS A FIX FOR THE CRASHING BUG.... IT'S NOT HARD TO FIND. IF YOU ARE REALLY STUCK, ADD ME AND I""LL DO THE LEG WORK FOR YOU. Aside from a launching bug which (causes memory problems??) and can crash your system... this game, to me, is a lot of fun. There are fixes you can dl to repair the bug and it works flawlessly. Frankly I don't understand why fan's can and have patch the game to make it playable, and why the publisher can't just contact the author of the fix, ask for it, (give them some love, ahem, money for fixing their broken game) and then patch it in to the offical steam file. Anyways, that ♥♥♥♥♥in aside. As you can see, I've spend a few hours (300 plus... oh my) on this game. It's not complex. It's a fun little blow some steam off after work or great for late at night when you just want to play a fun little game that doesnt require thinking or people. Right now it's on sale for $2.74 CAN, which prob translates to about $2 US. It lakes achievements, but other than that, whats the problem? If you like train games, management style games, this is a fun little pick up. If you want gran master strats and AAA graphics... keep looking. Honesly though, i don't know why this game has mixed reviews... other than the launcher problems, the lack of achivements and multiplayer... is horrible. Oh, and the depth... there aren't alot of levels. Still, thats why you hit RANDOM people...Honestly though, here are my ratings.Fun Factor - 8/10Graphics - 7/10Music/ Sound - 3/10Bang for your Buck - Top of the Line, Las Vegas Escort Bunny Ranch value for cheap motel backlot stripper club with 50 year old plus ripper prices... 10/10It's $2... seriously...

There are a lot of train games for the PC, but few are as lightweight and approachable as this one.I’ve heard it said that everyone has a little fondness for trains and this game is sure to appeal to that little bit in a big way.Contrary to Sid’s flagship Civilization series, ease of use seems to be the secret ingredient behind Railroads and its engrossing gameplay. Setting up your first station is pips and in no time at all you’ll have an entire network of trains delivering everything from passengers, coal, food and automobiles to the various towns and industries looking to reward you for your efforts.The scalable difficulty in Railroads is a real winner too as it allows you to tailor how in-depth an experience you’re after. The easiest difficulty will allow trains to pass through each other without delay whereas a harder mode will demand you route trains carefully, punishing you with delays should you mangle your track layout.Once the money starts rolling in though, things get surprisingly addictive as you sit back and watch your trains dutifully trundling back and forth between stations and annexes, generating you cash with a very satisfying ka-ching! sound effect in accompaniment.For less ruthlessly minded players at least, the multiplayer component in Railroads is somewhat muted, with not a whole lot of interaction on offer but the whole aspect of buying out other players on the stock market gives it some real teeth. I remember once hearing it described as a corporate deathmatch more than a train simulation; something that might not be too far away from the truth!Railroads was well received on release and enjoys a small fan base to this day, but it’s a shame that the move to 64-bit computer systems has hampered this title’s ability to run effectively on newer computers. Just be sure that you check the online guides on how to get this title working properly!Even so, it’s still a great way to waste a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon that’s for sure.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm playing under Win8.1, sometimes it does crash, but it's not frequent.The game itself is a very addictive one, and the custom maps from http://smrsimple.com/ make it even better.I would recommend it for those who want to play with a tycoon game, but do no want to deal with complex game systems.This (i.e. lack of complex game system) is also a weakness of the game: since you can not control the signals on the tracks, trains sometimes get stuck by their own fault (e.g. they change rails when they could go straight ahead).All in all, despite some errors, it is a very lovable game.

												If you're a fan of OpenTTD, Railroad Tycoon 2, RRT3 or similar games: I do not recommend this game. It's style over substance.Having just played Railroads (I stopped when it crashed) I can't believe this has so many positive reviews on Steam and magazines via Metacritic. It came out in 2007, but OpenTTD was more than alive at that time and far superior. This game is brain-dead. It's a train network game, except you can't properly adjust the train network! The auto-track placement and the complete lack of manual signals ruins this game. You get signals where you don't want signals and you can't remove them. The signals do nothing more than claim the section of track from here to the next signal, but that doesn't work when the game is placing a million pointless signals. It doesn't matter if you always make sure to use the green 'extend' rather than the yellow 'fork' placement. The game still produces insane signal placement. I had one stretch of nice smooth track with a signal at either end. I use the ""double up"" button and double up the entire length and now suddenly I have 6 signals right next to each other in the middle of the track, which was pointless and just messed everything up if I wanted to try and share that line. Creating passing places is also extremely difficult and trains will often just blunder their way down the track until two are in a head-to-head deadlock either side of the signals. There's no way to reverse the train so the only solution is to nuke the train and buy it again.Also: the fully stocked train is usually the same length as the track between the resource producer and consumer! There's no room for maneuver, which further exacerbates the no-passing-places and signalling problem.Because of the stupid signals and the uber long trains, you basically have to dedicated a line to each train. Trains cannot share track. I find that pretty demented and it basically reduces the game down to laying a track, build some stations, placing a track to exclusively dominate a section of track and then simply sitting back and watching. There's no real decision making. You can't sit their endlessly tweaking a track for extra efficiency as you can in OpenTTD.Also: The track-layer is also really finicky. When trying to create branches I often ended up with lots of tiny bits of track that took me ages to delete because it perfectly overlaps the other bit of track. Given that ""lay track"" is one of the 3 primary things you can do, it gets annoying fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game for all economics and trains lovers. Like original Railroad Tycoon game from Sid Meier. A bit boring without AI competition, so you should always play against AI. After short tutorial game is quite easy to get into.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like your management sims to be masses of spreadsheets, reams of information and to survive by the difference between 13% and 13.1%? if so, go buy Railroad Tycoon 2. This is a slimmed down, dumbed down, quick-fire management game. But hell, it's fun, it's cheap, and it hides a surpising amount of depth when it tries.Plus trains are god damned awesome.

												It's fun, takes me back to the 90's when I used to stay up late at night playing the first Railroad Tycoon. If you want a good throwback that runs on modern systems (I haven't experienced any issues), this is it right here.Don't let the screenshots fool you, this game runs at a full 1920x1080 (or 1680x1050).Enter bidding wars for new technologies, buy and sell stocks, watch your towns grow as your trains supply them with passengers, mail, and freight. Buy depots and upgrade them, build industries in your town for supply-chain economics. Upgrade your engines with the click of a button. Edit routes, lay tracks, get creative. Sometimes this game reminds me of building circuits. It's not always easy to set up routes for maximum efficiency, because at the highest realism settings, trains will stop if they run into each other on the tracks. You have to be careful how you lay your tracks, but that's part of the fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game when I was younger.I originally found this game at a Half Price Books on their clearance shelf. As a young kid, I loved trains, and dropped the $2.50 it was for the game. Came with the CD and all and I fell in love.I think i've played a total of 1,000+ hours of this game with that disk. Unfortunately, I could never find another copy of this game anywhere. My disk broke when we moved houses and I forgot all about this game.The other day, this came up in the steam store under recommended (Because I had purchased Train Simulator) and it brought back old memories. Picked it up and fell in love all over again.There is a known issue, the game crashing with newer systems, and there is a steam forum post with how to fix it, so dont let that deter you if you see bad reviews about the game crashing. They just dont want to fix a fix.As for you, I 100% recommend you pick up this game and give it a try. Very simple, very minimalistic and easy to catch on to.Game review - 10/10Also, Sid Meier & Company, I'd love to see a newer version of this game, If you could please.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Three reasons why you should never waste your money on this game:1. It crashes constantly.2. Even when it is not crashing repeatedly and unexpectedly it is extremely bug-infested and problematic, particularly when the train routing difficulty is set to ""hard."" Trains will continually fall idle because the game mechanics are not intelligent enough to re-route the train onto another track.3. The game itself is very simplistic and hokey (e.g., automobile factories in 1830?) and not detailed or prolonged enough to be enjoyable with other online or AI players.Considering that the title bears a Sid Meiers marquis makes this game a tragic disappointment.

												So, the first thing you need to know about this game is that this is in fact the original Railroad Tycoon, it's just been renamed and updated to play on modern OS such as Vista and Windows 7 (see other reviews about compatibility with newer).  There's a version of RT1 on Steam that DOES NOT play on modern OS.  But don't buy it if you're not working on an antique; you don't need it.As for the ""RAM-filled"" crashing glitch, definitely dowload the patch mentioned in other reviews, but before that turn off autosave.  It saves every minute for some god-awful reason, which pushes you towards the ram limit quickly.  With that turned off, I've played for six + hours without a hitch (though I also downloaded the player-made patch, so I can't tell which did the trick, if not both).As to gameplay, as another reviewer said, there are about 15 maps, each with scenarios that take about an hour.  However,  you can play them on three different difficulty levels, with 0 to 3 AI players, and each has gold, silver, and bronze victory conditions, so there are quite a few permutations available to keep you interested.  You can also randomize the town locations, but even without that, each time you play a map, the msc resources (lumber mills, cattle pastures, grain farms, etc) randomly generate their locations.The most fun part about this game for me is efficiency of transport.  You can have up to four tracks per station, upgrade engines, stations, and towns to make them faster and with higher return values, and also buy properties in the towns for extra income.  This diversification of investments is more important when you're playing against AI---basically, you can own a piece of your competetor's pie! (Or they'll fight you for yours....)The game is one of Sid Meyer's best from back in the day, and it balances well the ability to play as a sandbox builder vs a super-competitve crazy land.  (Part of the point of the game from the competitve pov is clearly to make 900 foot high roman-arched bridges over your competetors' tracks.)  If you play it like that, it's downright zany.  Truly, early Sid Meyer.  But it's also got great mechanics and logic, as per par for SM games.The graphics are also super cute, which I particularly like.  They stand the test of time.A couple of tips to players: There's a feature that lets you go-to cities (bottom left of control panel), which is really helpful for maps that center around places you've never lived/been. (Like various parts of Europe, in my case.)  Too, you can press + or - to increase or decrease the elevation of your tracks.  There's no other way to get a tunnel when it wants to auto-build you a bridge.  Also, holding the mouse wheel allows you to swivel the map, which you can't do in RT2.If you're wondering wether to get RT1 or 2, I like both, but for different reasons.  I think RT1 is a better game, though I remember playing RT2 way more as a kid.  RT1 is more about building and logistics, whereas I'd say RT2 is more about making money.  It's also a way harder game.  The graphics in RT2 use the Tropico engine, which is actually rather frustrating for that game.  The camera also doesn't swivel; you get four fixed viewpoints.  I could never find a satisfying map angel in RT2, and I don't know about you, but that just drives me absoutely nuts.All in all, a very solid game, a favorite oldie, and definitely worth the tiny price.  It's one of my top favorites of all time, right up there with Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Go ahead and buy it!LONG STORY SHORT:Pros:+ Very logical gameplay+ Well-ordered+ Cute graphics+ Short scenario play so you can have fun but still go outside and live your life+ Multiple scenario difficulty options + Some randomization of every map+ Town Randomization available on any map+ 0 - 3 AI players+ Kids can play but adults will be challenged too+ Historic events and engine progression is sort of in the background but a lot of fun for people who are buffs/nerds of that variety :)Cons+ Need some initial fussing with it to keep it from crashing+ Game starts to freeze on my computer when I get close to having the entire map networked (I'm on a laptop though)+ If you're connecting existing tracks, make sure the arrow cursors are green, not yellow. You will get better at it, but initially you will lay track to nowhere that you can't delete because your trains are running over it and you will curse SO MUCH.+ Can't upgrade all train engines at once + Only about 15 maps; can't recall if there's a fully randomized map option.+ There's human multiplayer on this game but I'm not sure how to make it work these days; haven't tried to use it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The track laying is cumbersome at times, trains don't stick to routes when you double-track well, the electrified track is missing so electric locomotives draw pantograph power from some magical electric source in the air, and you start to get annoyed hearing La Marseille every single time you zoom in on a city in France.And yet, much like every other Sid Meier game, it still manages to be addicting and fun. Not OpenTTD fun, but it certainly provides much enjoyment. Recommended, although try to get it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great classic from Sid Meier. This game doesn't deserve the mixed reviews from the steam community as it is a very good game that passed the test of time and it's only flaw it's the compatibility with new systems, which can easly be solved in 5 minutes without any particular skill.I will post this easy procedure here, as I'm seeing in the other reviews that many people are having problems with the game constantly crashing: Download http://www.smrsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/SidMeiersRailroads3GBEnabler.zip and extract it in a folder, which I'll call ""Patch folder"" from now on Go in your game folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Railroads) and copy ""Railroads.exe"" in the previously created ""Patch folder"" Now go in the ""Patch folder"" and run Startme.bat (NOT as administrator) A command prompt will show up, press enter and then press A. Some text will show telling you that ""Large Address Aware"" has been enabled. Press enter and then E to close the prompt Now copy the file Railroads.exe in the ""Patch folder"" back to the game folder (again, usually at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Railroads) Run the game from either Steam or Railroads.exe and enjoy this great game!I hope this fix will be of any help to whom is having issues with the game crashing.

												The thing about Railroads! is that it is simple, yet addictive. I played this shortly after release and couldn't stop, even though it had the strangest limitations - take the inability to build several independent railroads on one map as an example. Despite its oversimplified character and rather controversial artstyle (though beautiful it looks more like a Toys'R'Us display than a real railroad) it provides good exercise in imagination and the purest of joys - that of building your own tracks and setting your own trains on them to then watch how majestically they deliver cargo and passengers. That itself is enough to really have a blast with the game. Add some nice economic elements and not to shabby AI competition and you have got yourself a nice purchase. Definitely recommend.

												This game is very addictive. You choose historical locations and play through time periods. The achievements in the game match the historical development of the region as technology progressed as those countries grew. You build a railroad empire by connecting raw materials with prodution facilities and then spreading finished goods and passengers. The more businesses you own that produce finished goods the more money you make. The graphics are really good, its an old game and it still looks good. The terrain features and plotting of railroads work very well.Throughout a game, you upgrade your trains and stations to keep in line with technology and to control maintenance costs. You have stock in your own company to sell at first, but you have to buy it back or someone might buy you out of the game. You can also purchase other players stock. This can be a good investment stragegy as you can sell high, but a major goal of the game is to buy out all your competitors. The music is very amusing. You feel like you are gold digging in the Old West. There are several included historical regions that range form Southwest and Northeast United States to Germany/France and England. You can also generate maps based on certain scripts, such as no hills or mountains. There is a multiplayer but I don't think it is used much.Definitely a good game. The songs get stuck in your head.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this game as part of the Sid Meier bundle from the Humble Bundle website. I was quite excited about this game as I've played Railroad Tycoon II when I was younger (and ended up buying Railroad Tycoon II Platinum on Steam a few months ago). This game has the same concept wheras you start off on a map with some money, and you are to build your first line between two towns/cities to satisfy their demands. As you gain more money from doing so, you can then start to branch out and really build your company. It's not just about meeting the demands though, it's also about doing so in the most effective manor. That way you can meet demands and make the most profits. Although the game is not exactly the same as Railroad Tycoon II, it carries over a lot of the gameplay features. Because of this, anyone who has played a past Railroad Tycoon game will probably be able to work their way around this game quite easily. The game isn't too hard for beginners to get a hold of either as it isn't an overly complicated game. I'm am writing this review after playing this game for over an hour, when I wasn't even planning to play for half of that time. Just goes to show how fun and enjoyable this game can be.

												A gem of a transport/trade simulation game. Simple mechanics - build rail lines -run trains - transport things and people - earn money - manage your finances - grow your company . After you start losing to AI bots - you start seeing the finer nuances that the game packs below that obvious layer of simplicity.  The effects of terrain , random events ,the stock market , aggressive expansion slowly start to make sense. Like any Sid Meier classic- this one grows better with time.Sadly, the multi-player aspect is gone . The graphics are surely out -of-date but in no way ugly. I had to download a patched file from pcgamingwiki - for a memory bug to be handled. Heck this game is old - ok ? It needs some help from you to run well on modern systems. But for me, the simple tweaks are totally worth the experience.I wish this was remade today with Steam Workshop support and modern graphics - with no changes to the basic mechanics.

												Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon was the third game I ever purchased back in the 1800's, no, I'm kidding (Though it feels like it at times.) I actually purchased it in 1990 not long after acquiring my first desktop PC. I have played the series religiously since. I have roughly 100 hours in this game in the original 2006 disc retail box version. It certainly isn't a successor to the venerable Railroad Tycoon III, but it's still quite enjoyable if you realize this going in. The game is more of a ""beer & pretzels"" type real time strategy game with an emphasis  on attracting more casual type gamers. The game has a charming art style more akin to an HO or N scale model train layout than the ostensible real world look of the previous Railroad Tycoon games. Industry acquisitions and playing the stock market against other AI railroad barons seem to have become more important in this title with train consists and railroad track signaling unfortunately taking a back seat. Being able to build your own train consists is possible (and necessary), but the importance seems to have been watered down compared to previous titles. Manual signaling has been removed altogether. The scenarios and their variety are adequate, but pale dim in comparison to Railroad Tycoon III. Firaxis encouraged fans to build maps and scenarios to add to the scenarios available. These additional scenarios can still be found on fansites. The game originally included multiplayer. Be advised, this feature has been truncated from the game entirely. The Steam version of Sid Meier's Railroads! has no multiplayer feature whatsover. My boxed version would not run on Windows Vista without crashing to the desktop continually. It runs on my current iteration of Windows 7 64-bit, but there is a known bug concerning multi-core processors the game doesn't like. I noticed specifically when building long stretches of track I would get crashes to the desktop. I've played the Steam version for over two dozen hours as of this writing, and I rarely get a desktop crash anymore. I miss the previous versions of Sid Meier's wonderful railroad games, but oddly, this one has become my favorite of the series. Despite its lack of seriousness, it's still challenging. The game exudes Sid Meier's influence in every pixel. It's colorful art style blooms beautifully, and the sound design which has been lovingly crafted really adds to the ambience. Music from each time period sets the tone and changes along with the times. Zooming in to view the busy animations of each industry and city building is the icing on the cake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice though overly simplified in many cases. Also the inability to speed up things is frustrating at times when you're just waiting for the money coming in. The big but with this one is huge crash issues (at least with W7 64-bit). There are several possible solutions provided, but none of them is official and none worked for me. At times it plays for couple of hours before crashing which is fine considering it is very snappy to restart, but the times when it starts crashing constantly within one minute it just becomes unplayable.

												I miss the full blown Railroad Tycoon - but I like the casualness of this version too.For the longest time I couldn't play this game at all without it crashing.  I dusted the game off this week and did the Hex Editor fix to enable large address memory.  To my absolutely amazement I was able to play it for nearly four to five hours without it crashing.  I will recommend the game - but check Steam's refund policy before buying in case it doesn't work for you (with the Hex Fix)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, unlike some other reviewers, I've been lucky and it doesn't crash for me (not that I remember anyway).I think of it as an excellent game on a casual(ish) side. If you enjoy building railroads and watching trains go by carrying stuff from town to town, it's a very nice little gem. For me, it's one of those games that I enjoy when on holidays and feel like passing some time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: September 2, 2016
												i give this game a positive review (with reservations) because i love railroads and the general design of this game is a lot of fun. However, it does lack polish and seems somewhat unfinished. For just a few bucks, though, i think the fun value is definitely worth some of the annoyances. i definitely wish they had loved this one a little more.The Good: Graphics Music/sound AI is reasonable Easy and fun to get into and play Varied strategic options Animations; Lock Cam mode Gives the feel of a real model railroadThe Bad: Train routing logic/algorithmTruly horrible stuff here. Seems like the programmers outdid themselves making this difficult on players. You cannot specify one-way tracks in the game. Also, the track signals are nearly meaningless as trains regularly sit forever for no reason (it seems) at green signals while often ignoring red ones. This often creates traffic jams which cannot be easily resolved without deleting trains. Actually, what is usually happening is that trains won't move past a green signal until they see a clear route to a station and a 'free' platform track (part of the routing logic). The game will usually suggest creating another parallel track somewhere to resolve the problem. Better solutions seem to be: Create only point to point tracks limited to one train whenever possible and avoid point to loop, loop to loop, and ""shared mainline"" routes (although the latter can be done if done properly) Always have at least two station platform tracks at shared stations  Avoid adding 'extra' signals between stations Game interface/ease of play conveniencesSorry, but they didn't spend much time working out how to make the interface user-friendly for ease-of-play. Even the original Railroad Tycoon is much better here. There's only about a hundred or so improvements which could be made to make the game play easier (like adding opponents stations and cargo to the routing/consist interface, putting the opponents stations 'colored dots' on the mini-map, having various messages come up about events (such as opponents building into new towns, etc.)), etc., etc., etc.As a result, unless you want to get far behind your opponents (who build track INSTANTLY) you have to pause the game a lot to look around and see what's going on, gather information, etc., which wouldn't have to be done if the interface provided better information. Game scale and paceThe game is most fun if played in REAL-TIME (without stop-and-go pausing) but, though it starts slowly, as the players progress and there are more trains and stations to manage the pace of the game increases DRAMATICALLY which makes it harder and harder for the player to study and manage all the changing variables. This occurs because as the players' incomes and earning power go up, the costs to build go down.Best thing to do is keep your routes as simple as possible, don't put many trains on shared sections of track, and prefer creating new routes rather than fixing old ones (which is costly in terms of 'game-time'). Financial and stock market models simplistic and silly Track building (especially bridges and tunnels) probably not costly enough No track or station maintenance, only on engines All industries cost the same (and probably too little) No local market rates (i.e. as in RRT3), only global ones Costs go down rather than up No borrowing or interest rates Can't protect yourself from being bought out no matter how many stock shares ownedAs a result of this last, every game ends pretty much the same way - a race to stockpile cash to buy out your opponents.  Only 15 scenarios, 8 of them multiplayer (is there multiplayer somewhere?)The Ugly:Game crashes a lot due to memory errors and flaws in the construction mode when the mouse cursor is held over animations. Supposedly there is a fix for the memory problem.There's more, but i'll stop here.CONCLUSIONOkay, so if there's so much that needed to be fixed and improved, why do i recommend this game? Well, despite all this, when it isn't crashing it's SO MUCH DARN FUN!:)So, for a few bucks i say OK, but sadly, i wonder how good this one could have been if they cared to put out their best product.:(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I gamed for two hard weeks because I really enjoyed screwing around with the Gmod style track placement. (Which is to me the best part of the game.) The business system in the game is simple to follow though I do wish it was more in depth. Map's are neat and well designed but little bit to small for six players at a time.

												Despite its age, there aren't many games that can be classified in the same category as Railroads. To describe the mechanics of the game, you start with a number of cities, each with a supply, demand, and number of industries. As a railroad engineer, you connect cities by connecting them with railroads, buying trains, and designing trade routes. By using industries to convert resources to products, and then selling those products to larger cities, victory can be achieved in a number of virtual decades. Mutliplayer, unfortunately, is dead, which is sad because it would be an intriguing concept to have several players working together (or against eachother) to build up the largest stockpile of funds as cities are connected in a web of railroads.This game is addicting, there's plenty of scenarios to play through, and plenty of maps to use. Furthermore, by randomizing cities descriptions and locations, there's a near-endless amount of ways this game can be played.For the current price, there's no reason why a fan of Sid Meier shouldn't have this in their collection. Get it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is quite old, but still is one of the most fun games that I've ever enjoyed playing.  It has difficulties accessing higher amounts of memory in current operating systems, but these difficulties are easily overcome with a simple download from a fan site.  There are several fan sites out there, and they offer everything from new maps to historical livery for the trains.  The module which permits the game to address higher memory also adds coal cars to the steam driven trains.  Replay value is extremely high.  The only question in my mind, especially considering what the sales figure as were, is why Sid Meier's has not issued an update perhaps with some additional content in it as he has done with his other great hits, such as the Civilization series.  Maybe someday…			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has been one of my favorite Sid Meier's game of all time, I've been playing it now for about 9 years and even though I had multiple physical copies, bought the Steam version awhile back.As a child I loved trains to the point that my parents would have to pull the car over anytime I saw one so I could watch it go by. I also had a huge train set that we built that was about 24 feet by 8 feet . These little facts might be why I love this game so much, it triggers something from my childhood.Its not a complex game, but its fun and really draws you in. It is a litte qirky sometimes laying tracks and the track laying AI of the competition is at times questionable; but it is a 9 year old game.It is a game I keep finding myself going back to for a short game every so often. Now I have NEVER had it crash once on any of my systems and I've played the  Steam version with Windows XP, 7 and 8.0 (always Nvidia GPUs). I'm not sure what is causing some people to have it crash on them. I've layed tracks from one end of the world to the other, I had it pause for a bit but never crash.If your looking for a simulation, this game is not for you at all.  If your looking for a semi casual game then give it try, with the steam refund policy just put the game through a good test to make sure it works on your system since some people seem to have issues.

												Great time killer or for when your up and down alot. No real downside. Can even stick your own pictures on the trains. Best strategy I can offer is pause the game the moment it opens into the map and find out where your opponents are (1 player of course) and if you can afford it make a cheap stop and use your tracks to cut off the enemy train station(s), then build up money as your enemy flounders then buy him out and liquidate, can sandbox and build money/acheivements etc...

												I'm laid in a hospital bed after playing this game for 71 hours straight without food or drink. That's just how good this game is. It's always been my dream to relay Germany's entire rail system and with Sid Meier's Railroads, I can. I've been told there's a 60% chance I may not make it but I don't care. I'll die happily knowing that I connected Dresden to Hamburg via high speed rail. Knowing that the good people of Norwich can travel quickly and efficiently to Wrexham without a worry in the world. Knowing that the good men, women and children can travel between Paris and Calais without worrying about safety because, unlike life, safety in train travel is eternal. My friends, I just want you to know that Sid Meier's Railroads is the pinnacle of video game entertainment and has been undeservedly ignored for game of the year awards, etc. However it does not matter, to me I would say that this is the greatest video game of all time. I shed a tear, as I'm surrounded by my family and doctors, for those who have not played this game and for those who won't. Well worth the money. The greatest game in history. Goodbye my friends, my dying wish is for you to purchase this extraordinary game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you really, really dislike someone, give them a copy of this game."" by: pfk3I have edited my review here that I previously submitted on ebay 01-25-15 (by catwacker) where I had bought a new sealed copy of this game to compare or possibly replace the download from Steam that CRASHES, CRASHES, CRASHES constantly!No change in performance from the downloaded game to the newly purchased game.I've tried this on 2 different PCs running Windows XP Pro, 3.0 GHz Hyper-Threaded CPU, 4 GB DDR RAM, 256 MB nVidia FX5500 Vid card and on a Dell Inspiron 1521 laptop running Vista Home Premium, Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core TK-55 1.80 GHz CPU, 4 GB DDR2 PC-6400 RAM, ATI Radeon X1270 Video Adapter/ 192 MB Shared base Video Memory. (dxdiag Display tab says 1662 MB approx. Total Memory.)Never having experienced the crashing issue on such a grand scale with any other game that requires only a 1.4 GHz CPU, and 64 MB video memory + 9.0 DirectX, I would have to say THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE GAME and is NOT Steam's fault.Read on: Sid Meier's RAILROADS game has more crashes than all the world's real railroads combined. Problems with the game are well known and detailed in many places on the internet. The game suffers from not being able to use enough memory to run it.Fixes/ patches that are supposed to rectify the problem in many cases only seem to make it worse.Within the gameplay there will be MANY times while laying new track that existing track will disappear, and you will see your trains running on dirt. That isn't so bad except that if you wish to continue laying track to connect to existing rails in an area that has multiple lines running in a congested area, it makes it difficult to be sure you are connecting to the set of rails intended. As the game graphics become even more overloaded, (and they WILL), you will find that the terrain map will become ""layered"" or ""jumbled"", blocking the view of the actual terrain beneath it. Areas of water will appear where there should be none, further obliterating the view. Entire cities buildings will disappear, leaving only the train station visible. You CAN do a game save, escape to the desktop, and restart the game, and USUALLY most everything will be back to normal, but NOT always. Furthermore, as soon as you start laying new track again, there go the old tracks and it starts all over.Not all scenarios cause these effects on the same plane.The desert Mesa games seem to be the worst. Too bad. A fun game when it works right, which is not too often.One more note: When the game reaches the year 2070, it comes to a screeching halt, and if you were playing a glitch-free episode and having fun, well..... yer fun ends bud. Oh, and did I mention the out and out and unexpected game crashes when you, as the player are sitting back just watching the action, and did NOTHING to cause them? 1 Star Rating because this was poorly developed and after 7+ years you'd think new patches would've been issued to finally fix this wreck.

												My husband and I both LOVE this game. There's a lot of depth to the game that really makes it challenging! When you first start up, it's best to follow the tutorial just so you know the controls. Then, see how much money you can make by shipping the correct goods to the right city--but watch for in case a town develops into a city and wants new items! You can also build/purchase a company in different cities so that you can earn even more profits. Playing with AI or other players adds a whole new level to the game when you can't use or build onto others' railroads. Instead, you have to lay your tracks around or over their tracks to get to where you need to go. Playing with another human is fun as well; hubby and I quickly found that you can force players to pay an outrageous amount of money for something they really want--or something they don't want you to get. At the same time, if you buy a company on their rail tracks, they can simply stop shipping items to your company--and you lose all the potential profits you could be making. If you make enough money, you can purchase the stocks of other players, and potentially buy out their company. Be careful about if you choose to liquidate them or merge them.... Liquidation adds all of monetary value of their stuff the the monetary value of your stocks---not to your bank account. However, if you do choose to merge their company with yours (allowing you to combine your tracks, edit theirs, and so on), you'll find that the AI tends to be rather stupid and make money--somehow--from shipping a train full of magic nothing back and forth between two cities which requires a lot of poking around to make all their stuff actually profitable for you. lol.If you like management strategy games--this is definitely worth giving a try!The only downside is the game will crash a LOT when  you first get it. I circumnavigated this issue by simply saving the game every two minutes and then loading the game from the saved files everytime it crashed anyways. There IS a fix for this crash issue somewhere in the forums. Hubby has WIndows7 and I have Windows8, and the fix (which called for replacing the game file with another one offered in the forums--or, alternatively, simply typing in a few coding changes in the game file manually) resolved the crashing issue for both of our computers. Once fixed, however, the game will provide hours of challenging track-laying and course-plotting to hopefully make you millions (in in-game currency of course, lol)!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game for all of those train lovers because it is like a simulation of having your own railroad industry. When you see a town, hover your cursor to see what they supply and demand. Give them what they demand and give the things they supply to other towns that need it. For more information, there is a tutorial in the game. Anyway, I also LOVE the multiplayer because you get to build with other people. But sadly, on the multyplayer mode they no longer have playing on internet, now you have to play with people on your local network who have this game. But overall this game is one of the best games I ever played because I love trains and building a good industry. For only $9.99 you can purchase this game and have a fun time.

 A Game for Those Not Looking for a Tycoon-Level Game     I got this game as part of the Sid Meier's Humble Bundle. Having previously played Railroad Tycoon 3 extensively, I was looking forward to a modern sequel. However, this isn't a sequel.  This game is much less advanced in it's in -game economy, track types, consist editing, and locomotive selection. AI will also sometimes have issues traversing your track, getting stuck in loops, or not using low-congestion bypasses.  That's not to say it isn't fun. You can still enjoy playing against AI or others, but it's more causal train enthusiast level than armchair railroad president.  The graphics are nice, but neither advanced, nor detailed.  Textures aren't that high of a resolution, and steam locomotives lose their tenders for the game. Overall, enjoyable, but not deep. + Ease of Use+  Art Style+ Gameplay-------------------------- Poor AI Routing- Mechanics Lack Depth- Graphics Could Be Better  Overall Score: 7/10  (Good)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've enjoyed this game a lot, but it has its glitches, and they are considerable.(1) I crash to desktop (CTD) about once an hour, maybe once every two. Inexplicably. This is common.(2) Despite having multiple maps/scenarios, after about an hour on each map, the economy is simplistic.(3) Route mapping for the train tracks is... odd.Despite these issues, I really enjoy this game. I'm a sucker for sim/strategy games, though. And I guess I've got a soft spot for model railroads -- who knew?The CTD is apparently pretty common. Auto-save every minute makes this an annoyance rather than a non-playable issue.The economy being so simple is annoying, but is an essential element of the gameplay. i.e.: this city needs this good - send it there. That's the point! It would be oddly restrictive if the objectives swapped around.I cannot abide some of the weird and usually arbitrary route mapping issues. I don't understand why every route must exist alongside or connected to a previously connected Primary Route. What is the gameplay mechanic that necessitates building routes alongside your already-existant rail routes? This is strange to me; it seems that if you want to invest in a new depot in a new city and build a new line to a new resource, you should just be able to.Apart from these issues, I still recommend the game if you're a sim/strategy/builder fan. For $10? Puh-leeze. You'll spend more on your next meal at Chipotle. Spend 20 hours or so enjoying this little gem. You won't play hundreds of hours, but you'll enjoy the time you do spend playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall the game works for me in windows 10. Changing resolution sometimes crashes the game if you fiddle around to much. I think you can get around it by changing the resolution in Settings.ini File in the game folders. Otherwise I really loved playing the demo on steam and got the full game on sale by selling some csgo guns. For nostalgia trip get it's nice. MP is dead sadly but lan games are fun.

												I have had this game for a while, and its quite fun, though there are a few tricks to it, and now and again the computer seems to loose the plot, be warned it cheats, if it sees that you are attempting to connect to a city, it will race you to it and force you to spend more to build a bridge over its line or a tunnel underneith, One thing i do like about it is that it can be run in a window, while you watch or listen to music or videos as you play, build carefully as you go, work out where you can produce steel or paper and ship it to a newspaper or car/bomb maker, it will make you serious coin, buy up your businesses as well, they pay off in the long run. buying up a competator can get you a second station in some cities, which is great if you have a lot of traffic, i will sometimes let the enemy expand for this reason before i buy them out, then rebuild their railroad. dont be afraid to restart if you get a crap map placement, sometimes you will have nothing near you to use and make money immediately, its a near impossible position to win from, so restart another map, throw the dice and see if you get good industries near by.

												After playing hours on this game and completing several of the campaign missions I have come up with the following analysis of the game.Trains:+ Well detailed+ Cars (Wagons) are well detailed- Somewhat lacking in selectionLandscape:+ Picturesque and calm+ Nice texturingTowns:+ Well textured buildings+ Decent size structure- No roads/vehiclesTutorial:+ Well written+ Does well at teaching you the gameMusic:+ Classic banjo and/or guitar mixed with piano and/or violin give the game a classic feel and sound classy.Overall:+ Great game- Multiplayer servers have been shut down.All in all I would have to say that this game would make any train fanatic happy, the detailing on the trains, as well as the landscape and the towns, is phenomenal. My only problems with this game are: while it has a great amount of classic trains from all over North America and northeastern Europe, the amount of modern trains is somewhat lacking, and the multiplayer servers have unfortunately shut down. Other than the aformentioned things, this game is terrific!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As usually with all Sid Meier games, this is a real time killer. I bought this with a bundle including Railroad Tycoon 2, which was actually the game I was looking forward to playing. Needless to say, this overtook RR2 pretty quick. Don't let the cartoony look fool you: Even though this game lacks variety or a real campaign IMO, it is still a very good game at a very good price.

												Overall the game looks nice and uses economic supply and demand similar to  the orginal game. Unfortuntely, the track laying UI is horribly clunky. I have tried to ""double track"" sections of my rails to no avail since you have to manually connect the double track to your other line and no matter what I do it just doesn't work.  Additionally, you can only zoom out a limited amount so it is impossible to see beyond a small area. To add insult to injury, I am running on a Windows 7 OS and the game has crashed on me twice in just 4 hours of play. I would give this game  pass. Bring back Railroad Tycoon!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm only rating this down for two reasons. The lesser is that I keep getting stuck in the tutorial, either due to a bug or poor explanation, so I've been forced to figure out most of the game by myself (and play on one of the easy settings to avoid the game mechanic I haven't been able to learn). The major reason is that it keeps crashing. I'm averaging about one crash per hour, and for some reason the autosave doesn't seem to work. Really frustration to invest so much time, only to have it all erased.tl;dr I'll recommend the game once the game can actually be played			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have read many reviews about this game not working on new machines or that it crashes, i bought this game about 2 years ago. i have installed this game on 4 differant computers, including my newest one that have a nvidia 1080  graphics card and they all have played fine. On the game crashing I have had it crash one or twice over the lifetime of my purchase but never on a regular basis. I you can look and see that I have put in the time 140 hrs and still playing. I think it is a good game not a great game, I wish they would make a Railroads 2 in the future. I do miss the part of not being able to play the christmas map on steam. but overall this is a good game. if someone has a problem with it crashing or not working because your machine is 2 new all you need to do is update your graphic options for this game and it will play on windows 10 with no problem.

												Ugh.  I'm a big Sid Meier fan, and played a great deal of Railroad Tycoon 1 and 2, but this thing is a grave disappointment.  The gameplay is excessively easy; run some track and trains, money pours in, woop.  There's little need to fine-tune your trains or manifests, or even plan ahead.  The graphics are dated by modern standards of course but not bad, but cartoonish; all bright colors and everything lit as if by a spotlight.  Mountains are vastly exaggerated, making it hard to see routes.  Economics is limited; there seems to be no limit to how much of a good you can send to one city, so there's little need to search out new markets.  You can't issue stock, merge with other companies, or even take out a freakin' loan!  There's no march of technology: auto factories in the 1830s?!  The UI is OK, but a little click-happy; basic keyboard shortcuts like Esc to close a window aren't always implemented.Quibbling aside, there are two deal-breakers: first, the maps are small, a fraction of the size of RR1 or RR2.  They're also cramped, packed with towns and industries.  There's no lonely prairie where trains rumble on for miles between stops.  Games are short.  It really lacks any epic feel.  This is killer because there are only a handful of maps to play, and a handful of goals to achieve on each.  Having played four short games, I've seen about everything there is to see.Second, the tracks.  Laying single track is fine; the program automatically adds tunnels, bridges, and overpasses reasonably well.  HOWEVER, hit the double track button and you get your own personal demon from hell to torment you.  The simplest operations now require careful planning and possibly some build-it-and-delete-it cycles.  Trains will take the wrong track and fail to recognize tracks that exist.  Nothing's more maddening than carefully laying out track, buying a train, setting up the route... and seeing that the train won't return to the first station, because it thinks it can only go one way on a certain arbitrary segment of track... somewhere.  Except maybe having that happen over, and over, and over again.Oh, and it's already crashed.So what's good?  Station management is simpler; you no longer have to worry about exactly catching all of a city's industries, build a station and it just works.  Trains won't get stalled to 1 MPH on steep slopes.  For an RR1 or RR2 fan, it's all very familiar, the learning curve is tiny (don't bother with the tutorial, just start a game).  Some maps have custom industries, like wineries and fromageries in France, a cute touch.  The ""patents"" system is kinda cool - you bid against the other players in a brief open auction for a ten-year bonus of some sort.  When laying track in a city, the buildings will rearrange themselves to make room, at no cost, which is hugely refreshing compared to the massive PITA that could be in RRT2, where you sometimes had to demolish chunks of a city at great expense so your railroad could catch the city and cross the river.This thing was half-baked when it was released, and never brought up to speed.  I'm tempted to try RR3; as long as it's halfway stable, it's sure to be better than this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As has been mentioned before, regular crashes do happen. I picked this game up for £0.79 so I am not overly concerned about having a dud.As a big fan of RT2, I was hoping for a slightly more up to date version, yet I found it dissapointing due to the following two things: Lack of a campaign mode, and only being able to build track upon an existing line. Couple this with the crashes and I only played about an hour before I returned to previous versions.Had I payed more than £1 for this I would be a lot more annoyed than I am.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a massive disappointment to me. So much so that when it crashed (1.5 hours later) it was a relief.The most frustrating thing is the brain dead train routing. My trains spent most of their time staring each other down, neither moving, even though there was a perfectly good piece of track right next to them and one of them was parked on the switch.In a related frustration, signals seem to pop up like weeds. Only really thorny and with deep roots, so you can't actually get them out. These signals allowed my idiot trains to blissfully drive past the switch, resulting in the starting contest previously mentioned.It is also impossible to make a station longer, meaning if a train sticks out it will still trigger the station's signal causing the whole track leading up to that to stop.The stock market mechanic is basic and fairly boring. My biggest complaint is that you have to wait ~3 seconds between every buy/sell attempt, meaning you can't just totally dump a company if their stock starts dropping and you can't pick up a bunch when it's cheap.The lack of ability to form a monopoly was also irritating. If I own an industry, I should be able to tell it to not ship goods to my competitors, and even to not buy their raw materials. Or at least pay them a rediculously low rate.My final complaint is the size of the map. I had assumed that something the size of New England would contain more than a few cities and be large enough that I wouldn't encounter my opponents for a long time. Instead, I was surprised to find myself covering a full quarter of the board after having connected only two cities and my opponents building heavily in my territory.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved Railroad Tycoon 3 and Railroad Tycoon 2, and I'd read enough negative reviews of this game comparing it to the RTC series that I held off on purchasing this game.  Well, since it doesn't look like we're ever going to get a true Railroad Tycoon 4 and this game was on sale for $5.99 I decided, sure, it's not any more expensive than a Big Mac Value Meal, I'll give it a shot.  Well, I can say this game wasn't even worth the $5.99.I knew the economic simulation of the RTC series wouldn't be present in this game - no fluctuating prices, no inefficient ""Tycoonatrons"" moving materials and goods independent of railroad to simuate how the real world works, no independent industrial growth.  That was fine.  But there are only 6 or so types of raw materials, and demand never ceases so all you have to do is hook up more and more supply facilities to the cities.  Oh and there's very few cities either, and no growth caps - Los Angeles and Tehachapi will both grow into ""Metropolises"" once you give them their materials.  The maps are TINY and build out very fast.At first I was pleasantly surprised by some innovations Sid Meier has introduced to the track-building mechanics:  Tracks and stations can go anywhere in cities, no more tedious weaving around or knocking down buildings to get your station into a city, or having to locate in a certain spot to cover as much of a sprawling city as possible.  Just plop your track and station down and the buildings automatically move around to get out of your way!  Wonderful!  Unfortunately, the double track mechanic is awful and making parallel tracks connect to each other takes an act of God.  I found myself constantly having to build switches between the parallel tracks, and even high priority trains stop every time they encounter a switch.  Even worse, there is no undo button AND NO BULLDOZER BUTTON so once you build a track, you're stuck with it.  My tracks looked like disorganized monstrosities because of this, with trains constantly bogging down at a dozen unnecessary switch signals.  At least there aren't any sanding/water towers required here...but it really doesn't matter.Once you get into a position to buy out your competitors, make sure to liquidate their assets rather than absorb them, because absorbing a well-established competitor will instantly bring the game (and I don't run a cheap system) to its' knees with freezes and eventual crashes, and that's what brought me back to this screen, completely fed up.I don't know how this game got through the play-testing phase of development.  The simplistic economy is a disappointment after the fantastic Railroad Tycoon 3 but I can handle it.... but the track building snafus are just awful, and overall I find this game just wasn't enjoyable even when it does operate smoothly.  I hope we get a true successor to Railroad Tycoon 3 someday.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I honestly had no idea I'd like this game.Fairly simple concept, send trains around to get materials to and from cities and manufacturers, with the option to compete against AI or others online to build your RR company faster and better.As a whole, I've never had any problems with stability or the like, and it's an excellent game if you like games that require you to micro manage.

												Very good, solid enjoyable game. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys train spotting or model train collecting as It is a great way to increase knowledge on your train types and models. This game is an amazing work of art both graphically and in gameplay/style, the developers must of put a lot of money, time and effort towards making such and amazing game. Sid Meier's Railroad is the best game I have ever played and hands down the best game in existence. Buy this now or regret it for the rest of your life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is actually a damned good game. A lot of people who see this probably think, ""Oh that's just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator/tycoon game that nobody cares about."" If you've ever even began to think something like that about this game, before you play this♥♥♥♥♥♥you better head down to your local church, because you just sinned in the eyes of the LORD. Upon this game Christ has laid his blessing. In fact, Sid Meier is literally the second coming of Jesus Christ, and he used his powers to make games. To prevent me from using more religious analogies, I'm going to stop describing the game like this, and instead give you a play-by-play of how this christened game works:Alright, so you start off not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. I mean, you start building tracks, and then all of the sudden you're ♥♥♥♥ing bankrupt, so you sell the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed tracks. So, now you just have enough tracks to connect the little♥♥♥♥♥♥city you start in with the little♥♥♥♥♥♥town nearby. So now you need to place a train on the tracks, right? Common sense, you little ♥♥♥♥♥. So, now you do that. Go ahead, I'll wait. I would tell you how, BUT I DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW. I simply don't understand why placing tracks is the easiest thing on earth, whereas you have to ♥♥♥♥ing master quantum mechanics AND astrophysics to place that little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of a train on the track. Anyway, once you successfully divide by zero and get a train on your tracks, that little thing starts chugging along, pumping out black smoke and successfully producing large quantities of carbon dioxide long before the invention of automobiles. 'MURICA! So, once your train is pulling its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥along the track at the speed of a ♥♥♥♥ing snail, you can start picking♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Just drive on over to the little town, pick up a few ♥♥♥♥♥s and hoes, and then drive on back. Then, grab some peeps and ♥♥♥♥♥es from that town, and brong them back. You just created a passenger train system, congratu-♥♥♥♥ing-lations. What do you want, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? If so, the next step is sticking your♥♥♥♥♥♥on the train tracks when one is coming. If not, build more train tracks. Connect a ♥♥♥♥♥on of cities and farm and oil rigs and mines and ♥♥♥♥ing everything with train tracks. Eventually you'll have a disorganized mess of rail laying all over the p0lace. You won' be able to see the groud at all, it's just 100% rail, and the money is ♥♥♥♥ing rolling in. You are the wild-west equivilent (assuming you picked the southwest map; if not, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and stop reading this review) of a modern-day billionaire. You have all of the traits: ability to kill the locals with carbon output just to save a few bucks; the mentality that you can put your tracks whereever and whenever, and if anyone had anthing to say about it, you'll shove a train in their♥♥♥♥♥ and, most importantly, the balls to charge people more, when you know nobody can afford it. So, you are a ♥♥♥♥ing LEGEND at this point. You have stacks on stacks on MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING STACKS you dirty♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have so many train tracks that nobody can go outside without being hit by a train. YOU ARE A KING. What shall we do next? Well, I can add this track he- wait... what's that? Why is the screen black? WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? WHAT DO YOU MEAN RAILROADS! ISN'T RESPONDING? Fine, ♥♥♥♥ it, I ain't even mad, I'll just try again.Alright, after a couple of hours, I got as rich as before, and I even have a more organized track layout now. Wait... are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me? ♥♥♥♥ing blackscreen? Not responding? I CAN RUN ♥♥♥♥ING CRYSIS, YOU LITTLE♥♥♥♥♥♥ I THINK I CAN RUN THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥ THIS. I DIDN'T ♥♥♥♥ING SIGN UP FOR THIS. ♥♥♥♥ YOU. I'm out, ♥♥♥♥ you filthy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Final review: 8/10 really good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a gorgeous, personality-filled, light-load, fun packed game.I first played this title a decade or so ago, and I knew from the moment I first opened a map and started building my own little railway network that this would be a title typical of the Sid Meier games (Pirates!, etc) - a polished, balanced, aesthetically pleasing game which takes the concept of relaxing gameplay into active consideration.You take on the role of a railroad tycoon, unleashed into various theaters and tasked with fulfilling certain rail objectives. You start with one town and a single station from which to grow your empire. You connect to another nearby town and start shuffling wheat back and forth. Soon you spot a third town and head off to it, gambling on a long stretch of track that you have to borrow to afford... Connecting to the new location and the huge herds of beef cows it boasts, you realise with a jolt that you have nowhere to sell the cows. Frantically you search around the map for a town which buys them, realising that the nearest market lies three or four cities away. The size of your task has grown, the ambition of your railway firm has grown, the scope of the gameplay has grown, the payoff in economic fun has Doubled, Tripled, Fourbled and Fibled! You can't reach the far cattle buyers just yet, but you are able to shuttle passengers between your little network of towns, so you build a secondary line to your freight route and get shuttlin'. You spot marginal gains in the buyers and sellers of nearby hamlets and pounce, connecting them to your network, watching them grow and provide more returns! You upgrade trains - such speed! Such pulling power! - and soon hills are as easy to scale as descents, and suddenly you finally deliver those 12 cars of cattle to the distant metropolis that is dying for them and your bank balance goes ka-ching!Dem monies, tho.This game is just solid gold fun. An elaboration on typical economic management sims, the ability to custom build your own rail routes and work out new and efficient track layouts and schedules makes you really feel like the original Isambad Kingdom Brunel. The formula wears thin once you have conquored all you can, once you have maxed out every advance and the finite maps are chock full of railway lines, but the race to this endgame is just so fun that you keep on coming back again and again. Then restarting. The wide range of maps is also quite nice, since each map is of varied difficulty and houses a goodly chunk of play hours and replayability.It's dirty cheap so buy it, and enjoy it, I love it to bits.9/10.

												I purchased the game after watching a Let's Play and this is the Railroad Tycoon I know. If you are into this and you have a system that can actually run this game without constantly crashing this is the game you need. I've tested at a friend a few others that are not what you expect them to be.Even though this is the game I was looking for, I unfortunatly cannot recommend this game.On Windows 7 (my computer is almost a year old) the game constantly crashes. There seems to be a patch available, but since that patch does not seem to come from the publisher and fairly complex to install I had to refund.I hope the publisher will fix the issue and if they do... please inform me! I would like to play it, but not at 3 minute intervals (and saving every other action).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game crashes every single time I play. Wont run for more than 90 minutes without crashing. I have played the game at least ten times and I have never once voluntarily exited - it's always closed via crashing. Average times between crashes is about 10 or 15 minutes. Nearly unplayable, but the game frequently autosaves, so you can resume without too much loss. However, recovering from the crashes takes some time and is frustrating. Game is too simplistic; Signals, routing, track layout, enigne choices, money management - everything is made too simplistic. Once you set up a train route the game more or less takes care of itself and money comes rolling in. It can be made more difficult by tweaking the difficulty settings but it remains a basic and simplistic game. The game can be mastered very quickly and is too easy. Game mechanics are limited which means that you can't lay out tracks the way you'd like.Railroad Tycoon, despite being older with much poorer graphics, is a much better game than this. If you liked Railroad Tycoon and are looking at this game to offer something new/different/better you will be disapointed. The maps are tiny and after very short amounts of play you feel like you've connected all of the towns and resources worth connecting. Game speed advances too quickly, going from the erly 1800's to the year 2020 in like, an hour and a half of gameplay. Games are fast, over too soon, and easy.Overall a shallow game that is only a little bit of fun for a very short while. Glad i got it for only a few dollars during the big sale thingy.

												""It’s been a while since I’ve loaded this little baby up and I can’t believe I had almost forgotten how much fun it could be.  Released in late 2006, “Sid Meier’s Railroads” puts you in charge of your very own railway company.  I’m not going to bother reviewing it due to its age and time constraints, but I will say that it’s still worth playing today if you enjoy business sims.  It also helps if you’ve religiously watched “Thomas the Tank Engine” as a child.""

												This game really isn't worth buying.Bought it on steam sale for £1.50 so thought it was worth a punt, but it's hugely buggy (perhaps not surprising for a game that is now almost 10 years old) with regular crashing to desktop and autosave doesn't seem to work reliably, meaning you invariably lose what progress you had made.Worst though, is the routing of trains.  There seems no limit on the amount you can ""double-up"" track - except for in stations where four lines of rail seems to be the limit - but trains do not automatically opt for the deconflicted route, and there seems no way to manually achieve this (i.e waypoints or forcing to change station).  Trains just sit there at loggerheads until you scrap them!  Also, you have to tediously create cross-overs between lines, which would be OK if the trains used these cross-overs sensibly, but they don't.Rant over.

												There are better train simulators out there. Railroads is a very basic, fast-paced, easy to learn game that unfortunately doesn't get very deep. Train routes play out basically the way they do in most railway simulators, but with a simplified commodity system. The rail-laying mechanic is finnicky and buggy, which is particulary annoying as it is the primary action of the game. While increasing difficulty does offer more of a challenge, the mechanics simply aren't deep enough to keep me interested for more than a few games (which only take an hour or so to complete, which isn't an issue, but I mention in case someone saw ""Sid Meier"" and thought games would be 7 hour long civ-like games).In the end, there are much better transportation simulation programs out there			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is broken without 3rd party patches. Bad sign to begin with.But this isn't Railroad Tycoon, or even a really compareable knock-off. It's not a grand strategy, or even much of a strategy. It's a rather simple game, with rather limited options that just make it kind of... Bland.Because, lets be blunt. If you're playing a railroad game, you're okay with getting in depth, and micromanaging. It's a VERY dry medium, even if it can be quite enjoyable. This game doesn't offer that. And, the ai is just unbearable. It's (sometimes) competent at managing finances and turning a profit, but not reliably, solely because it builds really frustratingly. A combination of ugly, inefficient and sprawling, to the point where it will unintentionally block you (or itself) from expanding. Typically the latter.I was surprised I'd heard nothing about this game until years after it's release. Turns out there was a reason for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game but due to quality issues it crashes often, a quick search of forums shows this is a known issue that 2k has never bothered to patch. There are a variety of ""Fixes"" out there all of which are either risky or just don't work.I highly recommend against buying a game that is effectively stuck indefinitely in alpha state. This game should be removed from steam and customers refunded.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game as part of a bundle. Initially I wasn't very drawn towards it, as I find trains quite boring. However, the moment I tried this game, I've been stuck on it non-stop, even forgetting to eat at times! So far I've sunk 400+ hours into this just last week and I'm looking forward to the next half-term, so I can lock myself in my room and build some trains in this game.If you are into games like Skyrim, Call of Duty, Amnesia and Pokemon, you will love this game!

												Simply put, if you can run this game, you're too smart to enjoy the game.After the long hurdle of actually getting the game to launch, you'll inevitably realize that you barely feel challenged even at the hardest setting. Sure, it looks pretty but the map is so small and disaproportionate-looking that, the more you play, all the pretty toy trains and tracks will look overcrowded. Sadly, the only alternatives worthy of recommendation to this game are Railroad Tyoon 2 and 3. For those, you'll be challenged both intellectually and graphically.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would really like to like this game. I loved Railroad Tycoon 3 and this has a lot of those elements. Unfortunately, it seems to crash for me about once an hour or so, especially when trying to do long routes between cities. There are other places where the interface isn't ideal. For example, there's no way  (that I know of) to undo track laying if it doesn't do what you want. I'm disappointed in the quality of production as I think there's a good base there.

												Nice, sweet and simple gameplay. The game is held easy, I guess mostly to motivate younger players. Nevertheless adults can as well have fun with it. Its one of the games you can relax at because you don't need to think as much as you have to do in other games.The problem is: the game crashes every time you try to build rails just a little more complicated than one rail from one town to another. When the game didn't crash when you placed the rails it will surely crash when you place the trainstation. Really, Sid Meier? How could you give your name for such a technical piece of s**t? The games is unplayable! Unless you don't have a problem with restarting it every 5 minutes. When you google the problem you will realize, that you're not the only one with the problem, which means it's simply bad programming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like the classics.... stick with the classics! At any rate, don't pay more than $5 for this one! It is so dumbed down, buggy, and just plain unloved by Firaxis, it may taint your memory of the whole franchise.I know what u're thinking: ""This game LOOKS awesome!"" And it does! I give the art team an A+ and couldn't ask for much more out of them!But the designers and programmers should all be fired. (Sid too!) Again, it's dumbed-down to make it more accessible. W/E. But if you are seeking the deep, complex economics etc. of old RT games, forget it. And if you're thinking ""I'll just turn up the skill."", that will probably only make it more frustrating.Not enough in the way of innovation and LOTs of needless regression. No longer supported by the devs in any meaningful way. (requires fan-patch to run properly on >2GiB RAM; still crashes plenty, but not as bad as pre-patch.)I've played every RT game and RT3 is IMO the highpoint of the series; & 2 is close!Demo exists.

												This game outshines more recent clones like Train Fever by a long chalk!  Gameplay is easier, more logical and intuitive, and the graphics are much, much better.  The constant crashing mentioned by other reviewers -- runtime errors, the software algorithms run into logical defeats -- can be reduced greatly if you daisychain your tracks as per the turorial and don't try being ""too clever"" with collection/dropoffs on extended lines, or completing (quite by accident) a ""circuit"", since the calculation tables used are flat arrays, not paradox-susceptible loops.  Playing with an AI oponent also increases chance of crashing, as the AI is essentially stupid. This means half the supplied scenarios, which depend on you buying out all the stocks in AI opponent companies, cannot be played beyond sandbox mode. Using older graphics cards can make the animation jumpy, so you'll need a PCI-express based system at the very least.  My best AGP card, an ATI Radeon 1650 Pro, had trouble keeping up.  This is a wonderful ""update"" on an old PC title from the DOS era, and worth looking into, whether or not your played the original.One small niggle: no ""passing time"" control beyond normal and ffwd, the set scenarios are time-dependent (in game years) and this ticks away faster than you can build up your empire to the required ""win"" standard.  A ""llama"" or ""tortoise"" speed would be helpful.  Otherwise you have to put the game on pause to assess your next moves, and on pause you make no profit.Another niggle: not enough single-player scenarios.  Once you've learned how to play without crashing every five minutes (it's possible, I've done it), you work your way through the provided quest maps very quickly.  But hey ho, play them again for a higher score in the Hall of Fame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kind of have a love/hate relationship with this game.  For myself, it is an addicting little title.  It is fun to play for a few hours and come back to a few days later.  The game doesn't have much depth, however, and mastering it takes very little time.  It is a fun little Stratedgy/Sim but has a ton of flaws as well.  Being an older game, some of those can be forgiven.So, the Pro's.As mentioned, I find this title to be a bit addictive.  The map randomization allows for a different game each time you play.  The graphics aren't bad, considering this came out in 2006, and it's one of the newest Train management games out there.    The game runs very smoothly and is fun to watch.  You're always looking for new resources and at your existing track, looking for the best routes and tie-in's.Now, the Con's.Crashes on Windows 7 unless you get the Patched .exe from the forums.  Online multiplayer service is no longer supported.  Cheaty and annoying AI, which isn't very smart and tends to build track which would normally be impossible for you to do so yourself.  Very limited city management.  Games run on a timeline which makes everything feel very linear.  No real Sandbox mode.  Winner is usually determined by who starts out in the ""sweet spot"" with best resources near them.  Map edges are not very well utilized and you tend to have everyone too close when starting.Sometimes, the AI in the game becomes really annoying.  They'll neglect resources which they could use and instead lay track to a city you are already running a line to, hindering both you and themselves.  Also, like most AI, they do as they please and it makes me wonder if they actually have the $$$ to do what they did.In the end, it's a very simple game mainly about train management, routing, and gaining $$$ the fastest in order to win.  It would be nice if it had much more management, maybe maintenance costs or random events on your tracks.  Once you route to many of the resources in your area, the game can play on auto-pilot, somewhat.Is it worth $10 which Steam has it listed for??  If you like trains, like to play new Sim/Stradegy games, then probably.  However, it is an older game and a simple game, which can grow old fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game outshines more recent clones like Train Fever by a long chalk!  Gameplay is easier, more logical and intuitive, and the graphics are much, much better.  The constant crashing mentioned by other reviewers -- runtime errors, the software algorithms run into logical defeats -- can be reduced greatly if you daisychain your tracks as per the turorial and don't try being ""too clever"" with collection/dropoffs on extended lines, or completing (quite by accident) a ""circuit"", since the calculation tables used are flat arrays, not paradox-susceptible loops.  Playing with an AI oponent also increases chance of crashing, as the AI is essentially stupid. This means half the supplied scenarios, which depend on you buying out all the stocks in AI opponent companies, cannot be played beyond sandbox mode. Using older graphics cards can make the animation jumpy, so you'll need a PCI-express based system at the very least.  My best AGP card, an ATI Radeon 1650 Pro, had trouble keeping up.  This is a wonderful ""update"" on an old PC title from the DOS era, and worth looking into, whether or not your played the original.One small niggle: no ""passing time"" control beyond normal and ffwd, the set scenarios are time-dependent (in game years) and this ticks away faster than you can build up your empire to the required ""win"" standard.  A ""llama"" or ""tortoise"" speed would be helpful.  Otherwise you have to put the game on pause to assess your next moves, and on pause you make no profit.Another niggle: not enough single-player scenarios.  Once you've learned how to play without crashing every five minutes (it's possible, I've done it), you work your way through the provided quest maps very quickly.  But hey ho, play them again for a higher score in the Hall of Fame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cannot, with a good heart, recommend this (anymore). It's very much a ""light"" version of a railroad empire sim. The interface tries to be too intuitive, especially when it comes to laying down track, suddenly your straight track has deviated around a mountain, hooked up with another track and ended in a near vertical climb...seeing trains doing 180 degree turns on the one line then doubling back to turn on a junction is funny at the first watching, by the 50th time you want to strangle the guy that coded the pathing. Dare I say going back to Railroad Tycoon 3, whilst not looking as good, certainly trumps SMR for content and depth, but unfortunately it's unavailable on the Australian Steam store, presumably for licencing reasons (apparently available in other regions on Steam), but it is available elsewhere for download.

												I would recommend this game.  Read the forums for some crashing help.  I have played TS2013, TS2015, TS2016, Trainz, RailroadTycoons and this game beats them all!  Fun to lay tracks, complete scenarios and play against AI.  Laying track is easy, you can raise or lower intuitively and there are some really fun community created maps.  Pros:  Ease of use          Game play           overall game play is stable or at least for me          I play this over and over.Cons: It will crash at times          won't load custom maps (but see forums for help on both crashing issues)          Not being updated anymoreVerdict:  I would buy for $2.50 and enjoy every minute!  I paid around $10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played it just over and hour, did the tutorial, tried the first single player campaign, just realised how cool it was that the small towns have grown into large towns/going on city due to my rail network, and then the game crashed... again. The 2nd time in an hour, very anoying, I'm probably not going to waist my time with a game this crashy, its just more anoying than its worth/enjoyment from it. If it didnt crash I could spend proably another hour or 2 on it, but thats about it. The best train sim/tycoon Ive seen yet, happy with how to game works, its simple (compared to other train tycoons) but you can control and do a lot of things with the more simpler interface.

Mouse will move but I never see the game landscape, it stays on the loading screen (usually a picture of an old train mogul with a description of them).  Tried to apply for a refund from Steam but if I try to get my money back it says they will also take away a game I purchased separately, Railroad Tycoon 3, which I love.  No way to talk to a human being to sort that out.  I'm seriously miffed.   Steam you're going to lose your user base if you keep up this crap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played the Railroad Tycoon games before and you can't play them first and then play this one.  It just doesn't compare to them.  It is a simplified version that can be quite frustrating when laying track.  That being said I still wanted to play it but the game is crashing too much on Window 8.1.

I haven't played it in over 4 years, and can't believe its still for sale on Steam.Pros:Graphics are pretty.Cons:Its so dumbed down from the legendary Railroad Tycoon series, you basically have no challenge.Apparently from other comments it crashes a lot. (I never had that problem, but its so boring to play, crashing would be entertainment).There's only 4 scenarios to play. That's it.

												Don't get me wrong -- this can be a fun game to spend time on; however, it suffers from a lot of serious issues that detract from the experience. The routing system is illogical, joining and splitting tracks is a nightmare, and then there's the random crashes every now and then when you are trying to do something seemingly simple. I got this on sale, and for the $2 and change, it wasn't a horrible decision. It provided a few hours of entertainment, and now these bits are no longer welcome on my harddrive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a good game. Not awful, just not really fun. The highlight of my game was naming my train company: ""Makin' it Train!!!!!"". The rest of the game is kinda buggy (crashes), trains have bad path finding, and often just stop and stare at eachother, while your second track gets unused. I'm pretty sure all trains are prejudiced against that second track, and are playing Chicken to see if the other train will move over to it at some point. Like... they then win the ""Manliest Train"" award or something if they can scare other trains onto the second track, and never use it themselves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply not fun. The game consists mostly of waiting for a route to make enough money to buy another route. By far the majority of time spent here is watching the game play itself. Coupled with the constant need to micromanage your maintenance, bid for patents, update locamotives, etc...the game simply has too much going on. It might or might not be fun to manage the spreadsheet running in the background, if that's your thing - and its not mine - but its not very fun to actually play the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not recommend that you buy this game.  The simple reason is that it is flawed.  Steam should NOT be selling this. It does not work on 64 bit versions of Windows.  Don't waste your money.It is temperamental when laying track and trying to run trains on the track.  The first time you play it, it can crash 20-45 mins into the game for no reason.Then when you try and play it again, It crashes before it loads.  You try and load it again and it gives you a blue screen of death.STEAM ARE YOU LISTENING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - YOU NEED A BIG DISCLAIMER SAYING ""DOES NOT WORK ON 64 BIT VERSIONS OF WINDOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""No - most probably not.

												On my phone, on an app, on a forum, an old post, from 2002, from a boy, about a game he wants to make and  play. I'm reading, ""Character desing"":--A sad boy. It wants a marble rose held in a lithe, salmon anime forearm, extending from the screen. It takes it, and upon realizing that it has also turned to stone, or it was always stone, because it is fake, blows frozen smoke from both nostrils. While interacting, Talk and conversation sequenced by chats transcribed automatically, like subtitles, like autotune, obfuscated, and embarrassing, delayed and echoed so they linger, making it sadder. Is typing...: a shield is just a shell with #swagger. Like.A rapper tracksuit, at the mall, where electronics that ruined its life were bought by the people that love it most, and maybe only. Its power: a magic spell that turns crystal to glass to fiberglas, to clear plastic,  to glue, over a lifetime.-- night on the Stockholm street, hundreds of emotional bodies climbing over each other, dripping in watered down grey paste, placing soaked newspaper flyers on a giant Papier-mâché bust of anthropomorphic digital animal. I crouch on the outskirts, watching. They're all wearing oculus rift HD low-latency 3D VR headsets, I smile but not really. I don't care. I know they don't know. I don't care. Torches flicker and smoke.ANd then, I realize I am wearing one also,, an oculus rift. And this is the truth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Written from the perspective of someone who wanted an up-to-date version of the Railroad Tycoon series...This game was okay, I suppose. It missed a lot of the joy from the older, similar games. Track laying was both a positive and a negative; it was incredibly complex, which could be good or horribly frustrating.Overall, I guess it was alright, but if you, like me, were looking for a Railroad Tycoon replacement, this, sadly, isn't it.

												This is an overly simplified poorly built table top train game. There is no complexity what so ever, reasources mean nothing industry is two dimensional at best the train models look nice but the pathing they follow is so poor that late game railroads will grind to a halt as 5 trains are stopped trying to use one rail line ignoring the 20 other clear paths they could take. The only way this game functions when its not randomly crashing to desktop is when you create separate lines for each train but even then they will screw it up because you will be forced to link lines together at stations which only allow for 4 connections at which point your train will attempt to use the most congested line possible and your railline will come to a halt.. then crash to desktop.

												For someone who's played Railroad Tycoon 3, I would recommend RT3 over this game.I would say RT3 has a better interface, which wouldn't require you to go through a complete tutorial before you are able to properly play the game. This game requires you to play the tutorial first before you get the hang of it. I wouldn't say this is a con but I get to enjoy RT3 much more compared to this.However, I would say that this game's objectives are much more realistic, in the sense that the goals are attainable. RT3's conditions to achieve gold is kinda harsh, which can be quite irritating sometimes when you played that map for hours.Yeap, the game crashes quite often too.I can only recommend this game if I'm new to this genre, but I'm not.

												Buy Railroad Tycoon 2 or 3 instead. Whilst they won't look as gorgeous as this game, the game play is vastly superior. Firstly, pathfinding is broken for trains - they will often just sit at signals (which you can no longer set yourself) for ages, before simply passing through trains anyway. Secondly, it's buggy - senarios can span a century, and the game can't handle the number of railways you will build in that time. Trying to build tracks late-game can be frustrating - most of the time you'll wait a minute while it catches up and the rest of the time it'll crash.Avoid and play the much better RT2 and RT3 (latter is more complex and in my opinion more rewarding, former is easier to play)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Steam wont touch it.   Crashes right after i start a session after the main menu.  It's $9.99 too expensive.  Game is too old to bother anyway. I'll cut my losses and uninstall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I won this game in a giveaway.First, the graphics. compared to the previous railroad tycoon games, the graphics are much better.It is not realistic, but it is unique and sort of like illustrations in a children's book.Now, the gameplay. The gameplay is awful and nothing like that of the previous games.It feels severely lacking and sort of slow and clunky. The track building is kind of stupid. It doesn't feel like the previous games, and if you build through a town, it simply pushes the buildings out of the way of the track. also it lags when placing down large sections of track.There isn't much of an economy in this game, it is simply ""this place has this, this other places wants that""and there are so few types of goods you can haul.the stock market aspect of railroad tycoon 3 was so much better than this game. in this game, there is a few ""tickets"" that are somehow stocks, and you buy them. I don't exactly know what you do with them because i stopped playing this game.You can barely zoom out. you can zoom in pretty close, but you can only get about a hundred feet into the air, unlike RT3 where you could zoom out to see pretty much the entire map. In the third screenshot they show of this game, that's pretty much the limit to your zoom.In railroad tycoon 3, there was a detailed level editor and scripting feature so you could design your own scenarios to share, or play with your friends. After playing this game, I can't find any sort of level editor.Overall, this feels like a game you would give to your kids and let them play it while they are still too young to understand what a good game is. It does not feel like a successor to railroad tycoon 3, It seems as though they just took a good series, created a pile of unoptimized, dumbed down junk and slapped sid's name on it.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Train routing is quite infuriating in this one. Compared to titles such as Simutrans or Transport Tycoon, there is no way to influence train's movement and even the best network can fall prey to constant gridlocks (even having one-way tracks would be a godsend). Pretty much the only way I could avoid the issue is to give each line a separate track, which is kinda crazy. Or, play on difficulty lower than hard (with unrealistic train behavior), which in my opinion misses the point of a railroad simulator.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On my phone, on an app, on a forum, an old post, from 2002, from a boy, about a game he wants to make and  play. I'm reading, ""Character desing"":--A sad boy. It wants a marble rose held in a lithe, salmon anime forearm, extending from the screen. It takes it, and upon realizing that it has also turned to stone, or it was always stone, because it is fake, blows frozen smoke from both nostrils. While interacting, Talk and conversation sequenced by chats transcribed automatically, like subtitles, like autotune, obfuscated, and embarrassing, delayed and echoed so they linger, making it sadder. Is typing...: a shield is just a shell with #swagger. Like.A rapper tracksuit, at the mall, where electronics that ruined its life were bought by the people that love it most, and maybe only. Its power: a magic spell that turns crystal to glass to fiberglas, to clear plastic,  to glue, over a lifetime.-- night on the Stockholm street, hundreds of emotional bodies climbing over each other, dripping in watered down grey paste, placing soaked newspaper flyers on a giant Papier-mâché bust of anthropomorphic digital animal. I crouch on the outskirts, watching. They're all wearing oculus rift HD low-latency 3D VR headsets, I smile but not really. I don't care. I know they don't know. I don't care. Torches flicker and smoke.ANd then, I realize I am wearing one also,, an oculus rift. And this is the truth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is TERRIBLE, it is the FAILED attempt at a sequel to Railroad Tycoon 3, which is a GREAT GAME.  Sid Meier created the first Railroad Tycoon, then passed the creation onto another team for Tycoon 2/3 (which were great games) then unfortuantely he decided to get involved for the 4th, changed the name (and also the series....)

												This is a great game but please be aware of two issues. 1.  Without a fix for a memory flag in the executable it is unplayable.  Instructions are available on the internet for both a manual and automatic fix.  Just ask Mr. Google for ""Sid Meier's Railroads fix"".2.  If you also have Sid Meier's Civilization XX installed this game confuses that name with its own and insists on storing its files under the Civilization XX's folders.  I could not find a fix for this but the file names do not overlap so no harm done as long as you remember where it is putting its files.  It does not hurt the Civ game.On a positive note it has adjustable difficulties and is cheatable so you can fine tune your gameplay with precision.  Cheating requires editing the game's XML files so backup and be careful.Also the screenshots show the old 4:3 screen ratio but there are options for other ratios/resolutions.  I play on a 1920 x 1080 screen and it looks great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is without any doubt, the best train sim game ever made. I really wished more content dlc would have been published. This is my most played game ever (counted in hours). The graphics are really impressive, it is fun every time again, because there are many difficulty settings to choose from. People saying it crashes, yes can be, for me no, because you need enough ram and 64bit game. search google for SidMeiersRailroads3GBEnabler, this enables more than 3GB of ram. Now it crashed maybe ones per 24 hours, you can live with that. If you like sim games and like to build with all freedom and all kind of varieties within the train theme setting I promise you will like it. You can ride and zoom in the trains, the sound and music are great and not so easy as you may think when building real train track from simple one sided tracks to multi tracks, the possibilities are endless.

												The game is a definitve setback from the older Railroad Tycoons.* The routing of trains is awful. One basically has to build an own track per train or they will lock up (or one has to play with easy routing)* The 3D interface makes it very difficult to lay track as one likes it. And more often than one would expect switches will not work. I managed to had a whole track in a station unuseable for mysterious reasons. Routing wouldn't use it, Trains could not be set in there.* The 3D look is also more like a model railway than a real one. Especially the way height is overscaled looks ludicrious (the Western US seemingly mainly consists of peaks and valeys). Also one can only zoom out very slightly, giving no good overview of the landscape.* The economy model is quite simpel. Lots of X delivered somewhere => Price of X decrease slightly everywhere (if the fluctuations were even caused by delivery action). You can overdeliver a good to an industry (exhausting its storage capacity so it is thrown away) and still get full pay.* The differences between the engines are quite simple. One isn't even told their climbing abilities.* And finally if one wins a scenario (at least if one does it an age earlier than expected) the game crashes to desktop.The older Tycoons were better. A more realistic, albeit more abstract model of railway management is e.g. ""Rails across America"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What's happened is this: They took a previously very successful game (Railroad Tycoon) and brought it into the modern age. At the same time, to make it more accessible, many complex features were removed and replaced with very basic ones, if any. Pathing is awful, hence the addition of a ""pass through"" feature, where a train blocked by another can slowly phase through it. Even on the more difficult levels, you can't really go wrong. A lot of the industry feels pointless, the maps are too small, and the AI is awful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My grandfather used to smoke alot. He would smoke 2 packs of smokes a day. He smoked so much that he would cough and wheeze all the time. The smell around him would burn my eyes. Until one sad afternoon, he died of lung cancer. It crushed me on the inside. I closed myself from on the inside. For months I wouldnt talk to anyone. I promised to myself that I would never in my life start smoking and put my family through what my grandfather did. Anyways I regret doing that because this game still gave me cancer.

												Circa 1991, I received the game Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon as a gift.  I was a big Sid Meier fan.  I started with Pirates, then came Railroad Tycoon, and his masterpiece fo Civilization.  Each game sort of built on the last which was nice and there were clearly graphical similarities.  I played the original Railroad Tycoon for countless hours in my youth.  It was a great game in spite of it's problems (""rate wars"" where the loser had to tear up his track and leave town never struck me as historically accurate).  Fifteen years later, Sid Meier's Railroads hit the scene.  Yeah, his remake of Pirates was kind of crap.  And yeah, all of the Civilization games beyond Civilization 2 are not so good (Civilization 3 is entirely unplayable).  But this is Railroads.  It's going to be awesome.No, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥too.  Somewhere along the line, Sid Meier lost his magic.Pwninator score: 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not as detailed or difficult as the Railroad Tycoon series, Railroads is still a fun game for any train fan to play through. The gameplay is really dumbed down and simplified, but if you're looking to pass away some time without frying your brain, this isn't a bad thing.Like other players, I noticed that the game does tend to crash a lot on Windows 7. Also, it can be a pain in the neck to install custom content. Any new locomotives or cars you want to add to the game involves messing with xml files and code.Overall a decent game. If you like trains and its on sale, get it. If you want a more difficult and realistic railroad game, go for Rairoad Tycoon 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a delicious game that bring the player in the wonderful world of trains and railways, from the dawn to the future, through the main steps of trains history, with technologies and ""leaders"".

												WARNING THIS GAME CRASHES!however there's a simple solution that worked for me on the steam forums(http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1090651)it's an old game, you gotta put in some effort to get them running sometimes.----------------------------------------GameplayThis is a very interesting game.  It takes a simple topic of trading and vastly improves upon it.  People have said that the track laying system isn't very smart.  However I think this is a good thing, it's functional so I can always do what I want, I just have to actually put in more effort (3 or 4 mouse clicks) which makes it almost a puzzle to make the most efficent train tracks!The AI is acomidating to new players and simply adding more AI's can make simple maps much harder.------------------------------------------UIThe ui isn't wonderful to start out with, but once you play it for a little while it's very functional.  It is buggy a higher resolutions so I suggest sticking with the default.-------------------------------------------OverallI think this is a wonderful game if you're willing to put in a bit of effort, and it's very rewarding when you do.

												Railroads! is a great management/building game, especially if railroads interest you. It features scenarios to try and beat and set high scores on, much like civ or roller coaster tycoon or a ""tabletop"" mode that just lets you build out a railroad without having to worry about money or objectives. Where I think it really shines, though, is the multiplayer. In this mode you compete with other players to try and score the highest by the end of an era or, more likely, till you buy everyone else out. While the original game servers are down, services like Hamachi and Gameranger dupe the game into thinking you're playing LAN over the internet.It is worth noting that most people will have to install a patch that fixes issues with RAM and crashing, but there is an installer online that will do all the dirty work for you.

												With everyone being so negative about this game, I think i should voice my opinion of it. THIS GAME HARDLY CRASHES IF your computer is decent. Mine is halfway decent and I only had two crashes both because I ALT + Tab'd out which is a breaking point for any old game.Understand: This game is really fun!Pros:-AI's are smart. Very smart. I would go as far as saying they are ""Turnt af"". Yes, I did just use that in a sentence. -Making Railroads is very intuitive and once you learn the key-bindings, becomes second nature.- Finding the best ""Get rich quick"" scheme is a task and usually different with every play through. Example: one play it was gold that ♥♥♥♥ed the economy raw and another time it was food that did the trick.- ♥♥♥♥IN TRAINS! new trains, old trains, red trains, blue trains (Yes, train customization)Cons:- sometimes the tracks get all messed up and are hard to click on without selecting something else- Tunnels are very difficult to manage almost to the point where you would save more by just going around- AI's are smart as ♥♥♥♥. Like assrape you sideways smart.TL:DRGet this if its on sale cause you will spend lots of hours staring at trains trying to get the most cash and doing missions out the♥♥♥♥♥ Its fun.

												Fabulous, once you get the hang of it.  Lots of different scenarios and variations, so you won't get tired of it.  Fortunately, the game has a built-in time limit, otherwise one might easily play for hours on end, forgetting the outside world.  The game involves connecting natural resources to the industries that need them, and transporting them efficiently.  You also will want to connect cities to profit from passenger travel.  If you can't get online players to compete with, the game comes with up to 3 built-in opponents with sophisticated A.I. (artificial intelligence).  The graphics and sound effects are really charming (and if you zoom in, you may see some people walking around).  I recommend this game and I definitely plan to check out some other Sid Meier games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

WIsh they would make a sequel to this game. Multiplayer works fine through Hamachi as long as you change a few settings in the network config.The game is very addicting. But once you have it down on how to play it, it can get too easy to play and that can make things really worse than better. I still recommend playing it, just play it on hard to get more playtime out of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really cool game, old but gold. I like it better than RailRoad Tycoon 2 and 3. This one is easy to understand, not too complicated. The only downside is that you have to be aware that you can't make loops in your tracks, because if you do, the trains will start behaving weird, turning around on the rails and never getting to their destination.But other than that, fun to play!

												Wow, this is crazy.  Like others have said, this game crashes every few minutes even with autosave off.  The developers coudn't have fixed this?  I should not have to seach and download a third party patch for fixing their game!UPDATE: Okay, so after being really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that this thing was crashing every 5 minutes last night when I was playing on my new Windows 8.1 laptop, I decided to give it a retry this morning on my older Windows 7 laptop.  I purposely built some extensive track work and IT NEVER CRASHED - NOT ONCE!  I even left autosave on.  It was rather fun and I think I would have recommended it if I was using this computer.  So . . .  Buyer Beware. . . I would not recommend it with Windows 8 but will recommend it with Windows 7.  I can't of course do this, so it is up to what version your computer is I guess.P.S.  One interesting thing I found out this morning is that you can actually build a track route that is independant of your network by running a temporary track to the area, build your ""non-connected"" route, and then delete the temporary connecting track.  Pretty cool.UPDATE:  Just crashed for the first time on Windows 7.  Kind of give up here.UPDATE (8/10/15): Okay, I'm going to change my rating. I was very unsure, but I gave Windows 10 a try. Then I tried this game again. It has not crashed once and is running fine. So for $10 I feel the game is worth it. It's not as challenging and encompassing as the Tycoons, but it is visually interesting and pleasant enough for the money. So if you have Windows 10 and want a simple, fun, and visually stimulating way to pass some time, this will do it. It's not the greatest gameplay, but it's a cute diversion.And today I discovered and downloaded a map mod which included the entire USA!  Now the game has become even more interesting and enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just a heads up, you will have to fix the crashing issue by adjusting the size of the .exe header. If you are not comfortable with troubleshooting crash problems, I actually wouldn't recommend this game. If I find the file to adjust the size and the instructions again, I will post it. Now for the second problem to get out of the way: the game automatically places trains on your tracks. Very often you will have open track for a train to use, and the game will unfortunately use track that already has a train on it, causing both trains to be stuck if set on the highest routing difficulty. There are also a number of smaller things to keep an eye on where a small slip might be confusing for a while at first. Sometimes you forget to put a depot somewhere at all, sometimes your track doesn't reach the depot, things like that. It will generally be frustrating at first. Finally, multiplayer is based on Gamespy, and thus doesn't work. However, once the crashing is fixed, and once you learn how to make up for the routing problems (which you shouldn't have to), it really is a fun game. At first I thought it was going to be too easy, as I quickly moved up the difficulty ranks until I was at all but the highest difficulty level. Then for whatever reason I started doing worse, so now I play on medium difficult (mogul). There is a fast forward option for the late game phase when you are often just saving up enough money to buy out another rr. You can also pause it, and do stuff while it is paused. It is generally very laid back, but not too easy. Somehow I want to compare it to a more skill-based version of monopoly, I suppose because you are trying to buy out your opposition. Unlike Monopoly, it is nice to have a certain amount of cash available instead of buying up everything right away, since other characters can start auctions at any time. The fact that you can keep an eye on your opponent's current cash can give you very helpful insight into their intentions, though. In short, this game is not recommended for those who are easily frustrated. With a little work, both in getting it to work at all and learning the unfairly bad train placement, this game works fine and is pretty laid back without being too easy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's great if you like simple train sims, but if you're looking for something with more depth this may not be the train game for you. It's unfortunate that there isn't any DLC, workshop, steam cards or achievements, but it's still a great buy if you can catch it on sale. Only downside is that it seems to crash a lot, but that could be my laptop, or a Windows 8 issue. Seems to come and go. I can play 4 games back to back with no issue, but then have it crash on the next 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you a fan of tycoon-like games and have even a remote interest in trains, but you don't like to have too much hassle or too much management and construction detail? Then this might be the game for you!It's an easy to learn simple railway tycoon game that has simple construction mechanics, simplified management system and has neat graphics and a good sound design to make this a bright little train tycoon game.However you might experience random crashing (I think it's 64bit and more than 3GB memory related). This can be easily solved by replacing a few files with an ""updated"" version of the executable which resolves this.http://steamcommunity.com/app/7600/discussions/0/622954023416871417/Or look for threads on the Steam discussion forums telling you how to fix it on Win 7 or 8 or so. It's should fix the game to enable it to use more than 3GB.All in all I think it's a bright and fun little game for any age!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoy playing this game online with my friends (using a CD install, the 1.1 patch, the RailRoads.exe fix & GameRanger)  but its not my favourite game for making railway networks: Open TTD is (with its 32 bit graphics texture pack & the ""Pineapple"" trains texture pack enabled) because like in TTD, players can place signals for their trains to follow.Things I like about SMR:* Its 3D graphics and presentation.* Its train engine selection screen.* Its selection of trains engines with a different set of engines for different countries.* Its sound effects & music.* Its intuitive interface.* Its economy and share trading gameplay mechanics.* Its patent and town industry auction auctions.* Multiplayer games can be saved (like in Open TTD)Things I don't like:* The Steam and disk releases aren't patched to allow it to use more than 2GB of RAM: so players who have a computer with more than 2GB of RAM must download a fan provided .exe patch to prevent their game from frequently crashing.* A problem all the Railroad Tycoon series games have (except maybe RRT 1): Players can't make proper railway networks because they can't manually place signals for their trains to follow preventing them from making single direction railway lines and double line loops. Instead a train will always take the shortest route to its next station. So players must either make trains share bidirectional rail lines, stopping in passing places to pass each other (or driving through each other if easy/medium difficulty routing is enabled) or they can opt for the efficient, cost effective, unrealistic option of having one train per bidirectional rail line.Internet gaming requires the use of free third party software like GameRanger or VPN software like Tunngle: this game's developers could have given its players a ""direct IP connection"" option. I've not been able to make my Steam copy work with GameRanger but my CD copy does.The RAM fix:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1090651 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as I know, there are three Sid Meier railroad games out there.  I like each one, but this first one -- simply entitled ""Railroads"" -- is my favorite.  I guess when it comes down to it, it's the simplicity I like; #2 & #3 are definitely more complex and are really geared for people who like to mess with numbers and markets and such.  To me, #1 here is more about the building of railroads, which is really the point, right?  There is a market system, yes, but it's clearer and more manageable than the two successors' are.  And I have to say the actual building of a rail system is a lot easier and clearer as well.  Building a railroad in #2, for example, seems to be taking a step back in terms of graphics and ease of controls.The one (MAJOR) downside of this first game is that it seems to crash quite often.  I've tried it on three computers, each one noticably different than the others, and the game just crashes at seemingly random points on all computers.  If it weren't for that, this easily would be one of my favorite games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 TL;DR    this is a very fun although initially buggy game that I believe is for sure worth it----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Actual Review  This is a surprisingly addictive game in which you set up railroad tracks from city to city while also connecting them to different types of resources such as sheep, coal and oil to name a few. Your main goal is to transport goods from point A to point B while making a profit, completing some challenges, and beating your rivals. I'll start off with the negative aspects of this game which are: the game will crash on you about every 2 hours which is very annoying but there is a patch you can get online to fix that so make sure you get that or this game will be broken, the game can be buggy at times although rarely game breaking it can get annoying and games do start to feel a little repetative. The games in general don't take overly long to play there's a niceAlthough once you get some third party help to fix the random crashing the game becomes very enjoable even if the games can be a little short. Some positive aspects of this game would be: the graphics do look pretty nice, it's fun planning out where to place your rail roads to maximise on efficiency, slowly buying out your rivals, bidding against your rivals for perks that will aid you, getting new trains and planning the route you want your train to take. These are just a few examples of what make is this game fun to me.Although initially buggy and crashy at first once a third party patch is added it makes for a very fun game that you can sit down and play a nica simple game for short periods of time. This game may not be for everyone just because of how simple the game can be comparred to other simialar games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very fun game that does have crash issues. Still, when I bought it, it was on sale, so... It is a sad thing that they never fixed those issues.Pros:Fun, Railroads, Imaginative.Cons:Crashes, needs more maps / scenarios (it came with a good number, but I've beaten then all), care is needed when placing track.

												The game looks very nice, but unfortunately the gameplay is very poor. The maps are tiny, the economic model is basic and the management and track building concepts are very messy. Very quickly the situation on the map escalates out of control and makes you lose the fun of playing. If you want to play a good railroad game, it's better to buy the older Railroad Tycoon 3, which offers way much fun than this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Railroads could be a great game. The mechanics are great, the multiplayer is fun, and the overall experience is very well thought out. HOWEVER, and this is a huge however, the game was released in an extremely buggy state and has not been fixed.  The likelihood of it getting fixed is very low.  This effectively makes the game very difficult to finish playthrough in, and impossible to play multiplayer. Too bad, this could have been a wonderfull classic if it only worked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As the introduction suggests, this is less a tycoon-esque game and more like a giant toy train model track.  Only it costs you ingame to add more rail (as oppose to real money in RL).I have some criticisms;-The maps too small/cramp, everything is too close to each other with not much space to breath. This is not a problem early on but later on when you have a lot of trains it doesn't give you much room to give them room.  This is likely why theyimpliented a system where building move to make way for you, if it wasn't like that there would be  lot more problems.  -I often find after a while about 4-6 trains just glitch and end up in a part of the map where their routes are not located bugging out. Only way to solve the issue is get rid of the train and replace it. (edit: turns out like Transport tycoon, hich had the same problem, if you keep trains on their own tracks and DON'T link to toother tracks, they never got this bug.  So a cattle train must not connect to a passenger rail, it works anyway as the trains rarely also get in each others' way)-Ugliness.  Once you start building 4 track stations your map begins to really look an eyesore.-The double rail system is annoying.  Once you connect a double rail track to another rail you can't continue to make that track double rail.  Transport Tycoon never had this problem, its an older game.  And Railroad Tycoon doesn't bother being overcomplex. Both have better rail systems in game. Those are the things I've encountered.  Still the game is fun and a attractive alternative to playing the Railroad Tycoon series, its fairly simple.Some advice;-For those who cant make a buck; ignore passengers, they get you no money.  Even if the train hs to come back empty in one direction, it will often make far more money then city to city passenger and mail services. I figured this out after two games and now just ignore them unless the goal of themap states to do a certain amount. Processed goods should be your main focus of set up, the sooner you get drugs to hospitals and things like that, the sooner you make big bucks.  The game tries to push you to shift this inthe tutorial as  early train load, but I've encountered more profit at the begining regardless ignoring them.  Passengers and mail are easy, hence why its a lot profit service, as you're justgoing from town to town. Even later on, trains will not provide much profit even when faced with a 100mph train attached.  You cn earn a buck with these, but this involves setting up a single train to go around every town. -If a industry is going to even hint it will mke money before you start a train unloading there buy it; usually within 15 years with regular supply by your trains it earns back the cost and goes into profit.-If a trains says it handles ""frieght"" stuff, but its slower then that passenger train capable olf 100 mph, still buy it.  The ideal cargo thing actually pays off, for 20 less speed it often hauls just as well or slightly better speed. -If you can afford a train and the maintance cost of id train is cheaper, upgrade.-You don't have to upgrade every train to the latest model, but bare in mind their cheaper and if you have the cash its best to.  Short of money?  Ether you've set up your trains wrong or just resort to every other model upgrade until you have millions in pocket.  But don't ignore upgrading completely. The newer trains haul cargo at a faster pace.-Invest in patents even if your the only player in the game.  That early purchase often hs huge benefits and later on in the game, you will soon back tht 50,000 you spent on it within seconds often. If you have enouh room to create a short cut rail between different stations, do it.  the fastest single problem this game has, particular when faster trains come out is the overload of trains to every station.  If you have find room for a rail that will avoid a train being somewhere it doesn't need to be thisis great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sid Meier's Railroads is a great game, it is just so fun to watch your little railroad company grow to a huge empire with giant cities, fast trains and everything getting really busy.It is easy to just pick up and play, the rules are simple and there is not much variety, this is both the games greatest strength and biggest weakness. It is really easy to learn but you get quite bored of it after a while, it is only fun to play for about two hours a day. But it is fortunately not possible to play this game for a long time because it crashes, a lot. It gets really annoying:-Remove wrong part of the tracks that doesn't exist anymore but still shows up : Crash-Accidentaly build overlapping tracks : Crash-Taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥in rl and then coming back : CrashSo you really need to save a lot, but it not only crashes, it has quite some bugs too:-Often the double railways don't really detect the stations so that no ""dropoff zone"" is being created-Trains clipping through each other-Trains taking unnecessarily long ways to the dropoff stationBut, do I still recommend it?Definitely!If you can get it for a really low price you will have quite some fun for a few hours, but important:SAVE!Or you will get really angry at the game.It is just really fun to watch everything evolve and something for a nice sunday afternoon with not much action and a really low difficulty.

												This game is fantastic in a lot of ways. The game brings me back to my 'Railroad Tycoon' games and is wonderfully fun with competitive stockmarket sharing and everything! The game incorporates several different maps, resources and resource types across maps. Releases new technology as time goes on -- the game is exciting and a lot of fun....BUT. I do not recommend this game unless you wish to sit there and have consistent disappointment for one reason. The game looks like it would be fantastic in multiplayer but I dare not even try it because EVERY THREE MINUTES -- the game just crashes. It seems to be a consistent problem across many of Sid Meier's games too. Fix this problem! The game would be recommended with the best rating I could give it if it was not for this REALLY annoying factor. Also, to add to frustration - the game claims it saves every so often. Where? I cannot find any mention of any save file. I could just save it myself but unless you wish to save every 15 seconds -- and I mean, literally -- then you will continually keep losing data again and again with this game. It's just not worth the time.[EDIT: If you download a patch that can be found online, and use it to override your copy of this game - it works perfectly. Like a charm. No more crashes and the game becomes awesome again. I'll change my rating to a thumbs up but BE WARNED all - you will need this downloaded patch to play the game, after you get it - it becomes awesome again].			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you a fan of tycoon-like games and have even a remote interest in trains, but you don't like to have too much hassle or too much management and construction detail? Then this might be the game for you!It's an easy to learn simple railway tycoon game that has simple construction mechanics, simplified management system and has neat graphics and a good sound design to make this a bright little train tycoon game.However you might experience random crashing (I think it's 64bit and more than 3GB memory related). This can be easily solved by replacing a few files with an ""updated"" version of the executable which resolves this.http://steamcommunity.com/app/7600/discussions/0/622954023416871417/Or look for threads on the Steam discussion forums telling you how to fix it on Win 7 or 8 or so.

												This is a great game when you want a break from FPS games.  Much like Sid Meier's Civilization this game subtly teaches a bit of railway history.  This game is not a Railway Sim game that you need to aquire the keen skills of driving a train.Most of the time I have played this game in single player mode againts 3 A.I. players. The A.I. can be ruthless when playing playing at hard levels. The A.I. generally doesn't waste money and calculates the best return on investment. With a bit of strategy you can compete for the same resources making it more costly for them to operate.I have played this game on a LAN with four players.  Multiplayer game play feels more like a single player map early on, Once you have expanded you railway empire, it starts to get really interesting as you complete for the same limited resources.  The game may eventually crash after all the players railways have grown very large.   You will need to find the 3GB Ram fix to make the game work with large complex maps.There are a number of community maps / mods that can be really fun to play and introduce you to new areas of the world.After playing Sid Meier's Civilization I found zooming out to see a larger area (FOV) of the map is very limited. This is somewhat like using a flashight in a cave, you only see small areas of what may be an enormous space.Maybe one day they may entertain the idea of developing a Sid Meier's Railroad 2.

												This game is incredibly fun for a tycoon game.Although a bit ""watered down"" as far as all tycoons go, this game is fun if you want a laid-back fun experience or a competitive and difficult tycoon game.Also, fun if you love railroads.Note: I play the game on Windows 8.1 64-bit, and when launched through Steam the game has no crashes. If you experience crashes in similar conditions, refer to Furanos' method of changing the GameDate file. Note 2: Due to GameSpy shutting down their servers, the online and internet multiplayer no longer functions. However, you can play with AI opponents in singleplayer and as far as I know the LAN multiplayer still works.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has got to be my all time favorite game. Its relaxing, its challenging and it has trains! Plus to me the interface is just a joy to use unlike a lot of similar games. The actual game consists of moving goods from one city to another via trains. You need to balance price of the train with potential income form the root. It a little dated and lacks maps (although looking at the amount of time Iv put into this game, no amount of maps would have been enough), it does run a little strange on windows 8, I get some clipping, slow down and a few crashes. But this does not distract to much from gameplay (if at all).  There are user created mods/ extra maps that you can download, little bit of a pain to install, but well worth it. All in all the is probably the best game ever made! I actually think the steam estimation of time is about 1/9 of the actual time! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game when you want a break from FPS games.  Much like Sid Meier's Civilization this game subtly teaches a bit of railway history.  This game is not a Railway Sim game that you need to aquire the keen skills of driving a train.Most of the time I have played this game in single player mode againts 3 A.I. players. The A.I. can be ruthless when playing playing at hard levels. The A.I. generally doesn't waste money and calculates the best return on investment. With a bit of strategy you can compete for the same resources making it more costly for them to operate.I have played this game on a LAN with four players.  Multiplayer game play feels more like a single player map early on, Once you have expanded you railway empire, it starts to get really interesting as you complete for the same limited resources.  The game may eventually crash after all the players railways have grown very large.   You will need to find the 3GB Ram fix to make the game work with large complex maps.There are a number of community maps / mods that can be really fun to play and introduce you to new areas of the world.After playing Sid Meier's Civilization I found zooming out to see a larger area (FOV) of the map is very limited. This is somewhat like using a flashight in a cave, you only see small areas of what may be an enormous space.Maybe one day they may entertain the idea of developing a Sid Meier's Railroad 2.

												Not as good as the other tycoons, in my opinion misses a lot of the first games options such as putting electric railroad and the gameplay and zoom out of the map view is not as good, there is no breakdowns, nothing. The older ones were simply better in those gameplay options and were way harder. But it has nice graphics, and it's still a good game overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not as detailed or difficult as the Railroad Tycoon series, Railroads is still a fun game for any train fan to play through. The gameplay is really dumbed down and simplified, but if you're looking to pass away some time without frying your brain, this isn't a bad thing.Like other players, I noticed that the game does tend to crash a lot on Windows 7. Also, it can be a pain in the neck to install custom content. Any new locomotives or cars you want to add to the game involves messing with xml files and code.Overall a decent game. If you like trains and its on sale, get it. If you want a more difficult and realistic railroad game, go for Rairoad Tycoon 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another excellent Sid Meier's title and good from a historical perspective. Although not as deep as the older titles in this series, I find the focus change to be more like a RTS refreshing. It keeps the games shorter. On easy, one can defeat the AI within an hour or so. On harder levels it is a bit more difficult. The game has great replayability and I am happy to have found it again on Steam.The game itself is aging and it would be nice to see something similar on a modern game engine. Most of the train games made now are more into the simulation of running a train and not the overall business from a historical perspective.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For me it's a game I keep coming back to, the newer games have lost the simple functionality that made this game great.A little buggy on Win7+. May start crashing if you play a very long game. Also AI is too easy, if you can get into the best stuff (wine/cars/arms) early in the game it's all a win, if you don't then you probably be bought out half way through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoy playing this game online with my friends (using a CD install, the 1.1 patch, the RailRoads.exe fix & GameRanger)  but its not my favourite game for making railway networks: Open TTD is (with its 32 bit graphics texture pack & the ""Pineapple"" trains texture pack enabled) because like in TTD, players can place signals for their trains to follow.Things I like about SMR:* Its 3D graphics and presentation.* Its train engine selection screen.* Its selection of trains engines with a different set of engines for different countries.* Its sound effects & music.* Its intuitive interface.* Its economy and share trading gameplay mechanics.* Its patent and town industry auction auctions.* Multiplayer games can be saved (like in Open TTD)Things I don't like:* The Steam and disk releases aren't patched to allow it to use more than 2GB of RAM: so players who have a computer with more than 2GB of RAM must download a fan provided .exe patch to prevent their game from frequently crashing.* A problem all the Railroad Tycoon series games have (except maybe RRT 1): Players can't make proper railway networks because they can't manually place signals for their trains to follow preventing them from making single direction railway lines and double line loops. Instead a train will always take the shortest route to its next station. So players must either make trains share bidirectional rail lines, stopping in passing places to pass each other (or driving through each other if easy/medium difficulty routing is enabled) or they can opt for the efficient, cost effective, unrealistic option of having one train per bidirectional rail line.Internet gaming requires the use of free third party software like GameRanger or VPN software like Tunngle: this game's developers could have given its players a ""direct IP connection"" option. I've not been able to make my Steam copy work with GameRanger but my CD copy does.The RAM fix:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1090651 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Standard pick up and delivery train game, with Sid Meier flare. Nothing amazing but a relatively relaxing sort of game. If there is a negative I have to say the lack of a map regenerate option at the beginning of the game similar to what Civ 4 etc have. Sometimes the resources and town production are totally out of whack when doing random generation. Would be nice not to need to go all the way back to the main menu and start over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARNING: THIS GAME CAN BE BUGGY!  EXPECT IT TO CRASH!  SAVE FEQUENTLY, AND YOU WON'T HAVE ISSUES!Now to the review; I haven't really played this game as hard as I would like to, I usually just go and play what would be equivalent to 'sandbox', and just enjoy time time passing by.  I got the game through a Humble Bundle, and I do enjoy it as a part of my collection.  If you're into casual games, but with some though, this one is for you.  JUST BE SURE TO SAVE OFTEN!

												Great game, less complex than Railroad Tycoon 1-3.  Plagued by constant and random crashes - which is a major shame.  Only upside is the autosave feature, meaning I never lose more than 1-2 mins of game play.  Recommend for game, dont recommend for stability issues (Windows 7).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game when you want a break from FPS games.  Much like Sid Meier's Civilization this game subtly teaches a bit of railway history.  This game is not a Railway Sim game that you need to aquire the keen skills of driving a train.Most of the time I have played this game in single player mode againts 3 A.I. players. The A.I. can be ruthless when playing playing at hard levels. The A.I. generally doesn't waste money and calculates the best return on investment. With a bit of strategy you can compete for the same resources making it more costly for them to operate.I have played this game on a LAN with four players.  Multiplayer game play feels more like a single player map early on, Once you have expanded you railway empire, it starts to get really interesting as you complete for the same limited resources.  The game may eventually crash after all the players railways have grown very large.   You will need to find the 3GB Ram fix to make the game work with large complex maps.There are a number of community maps / mods that can be really fun to play and introduce you to new areas of the world.After playing Sid Meier's Civilization I found zooming out to see a larger area (FOV) of the map is very limited. This is somewhat like using a flashight in a cave, you only see small areas of what may be an enormous space.Maybe one day they may entertain the idea of developing a Sid Meier's Railroad 2.

												This is a classic Sid Meier game.  For the price it is extremely fun, and you can finish a game in a relatively short amount of time. Build the most efficient railroad, and then buy up all of your competition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: Highly addictive, very intuitive, high 'fun factor'.  Easy for beginners but challenging if you want it to be.Cons: High click-count to manage the details, once your empire starts to grow.   I'm experiencing a lot of crashes.			",25,5,0,12,26,1,23

												what can i say? it reminds me of the 1800's train board game.s its a bit weak in areas (i.e. stocks and companies) but over all a fun and quick strategy game. (4 player human game max time maybe 30-45 minutes toplay a full game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Old isn't necessarily bad. There are a lot of games out there like this one, and this was not the first. For me it's a game I keep coming back to, the newer games have lost the simple functionality that made this game great.A little buggy on Win7+. May start crashing if you play a very long game. Also AI is too easy, if you can get into the best stuff (wine/cars/arms) early in the game it's all a win, if you don't then you probably be bought out half way through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game for sure but be warned if you have an OS of Vista or higher this game will crash allot so my advice is to save vary often. Other then that 10/10 for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
