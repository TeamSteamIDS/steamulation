												[Edited first two paragraphs for clarification.]I will not write a complete review, there are enough of those here. I will not rant, either. I have played the game and I like the concept; the complexity, micro-managing and pace are fine by me (except you either get declared war on by everybody immediately or nothing happens at all). When I started playing it, I had fun.However, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game for a very simple reason: It's incomplete and has several hefty issues with elements that are vital to the gameplay (AI and performance), and thus borders on a scam; at the very least, it reflects poorly on BattleGoat's business ethics.This game (main game and addon) was supposed to receive additional attention after release, adding several more features (including a fallout/radioactivity and an environmental impact system). The game did indeed receive several content updates and additional features but, sadly, BattleGoat abandoned the game before the addition and/or revision of several critical features, leaving the game with a stupid AI, pretty damn buggy and, worst of all, content incomplete (which shows - there are buildings, designs, research that are completely pointless because the corresponding parts of the game were never implemented).I therefore recommend that you avoid this game (and other games from BattleGoat) at all cost. This game is basically a polished Alpha and if the devs couldn't be bothered to finish this game, even after people already bought it, they are not worth your attention. Business practices like that should not be condoned or supported, so think twice before you buy from them - There may very well be a better, finished game out there.EDIT: Since one of the devs commented on this 'review' (and my full response doesn't fit in a single comment), I will add his statement and my response to it to the 'review' itself.chrisahl [developer] wrote:""Many statements in this review are completely false. The game received multiple updates for approximately 18 months after release of the core game including the life cycle of the expansion pack. The game is no buggy, it is one of the most stable titles on the market. I'll hold it up to anything else out there. Features such as radioactive fallout where never promised and many never promised features were added. The content was also completed with multiple campaigns and scenarios. The tech tree is complete containing hundreds of technologies to research. Unit designs are all buildable and as usable as their specs warrant.""I don't know what game you're talking about, Chris, but it's not this game. I played it a lot more than my record says, and there are few games that have crashed so often on me as this one (which is why I eventually stopped playing when you guys announced that you were moving on - it got to the point where it was simply not enjoyable because the game became more unstable [and lost a lot of performance] as the world progressed and units were built). And that happened pretty much in every session because, of course, you need an army to get stuff done. For what it sets out to do, the game is not nearly optimized enough - and that's not great but we can chalk that up to a lack of experience if we want to be nice about it.That, however, does not apply to the crashes. Those are bugs (unless you want to call it a feature?) and gamebreaking bugs that are left in the game at the end of its lifecycle (which is technically not over since Steam allows you to still make some sales) are not exactly a sign of good business ethics.As for fallout and environment: You can say they weren't ""promised"", great. And I realize that I implied that you didn't add anything to the game (which I have rectified), which is unfair. But it still doesn't reflect positively on the development team when they obviously intended to implement it, put in some elements (and adjusted tooltips to hint at this feature and tell the player what he'd need this building or that research for), then decided ""Oooh, lets do this, this and this first"" instead of delivering on what was already halfway done and, finally, announced that they were done with the game when there were still a lot of loose ends. The least you can do is go through it and remove the redundant content. Yes, that would have been extra work for you guys when you were eager to create your Cold War version of this, but it would have been at least an attempt at making it look like you were sorry about it.(As for the other things you mentioned [campaigns, tech tree, units]... Well, I don't really know why you did. I didn't put their existence into doubt and their being there doesn't change that some other features simply did not receive enough attention.)

												Supreme Ruler 2020 Gold is the combined product of Supreme Ruler 2020 and Global Crisis.Produced by Battlegoat Studios and published by Paradox Interactive. (R1)It is the child of the former *Supreme Ruler 2010 and It has expanded on the original game. (R2)Note, please go to the bottom for a TLDR summary.1. IntroductionThere are 3 game modes. ● Campaign● Sandbox● ScenarioCampaign and sandbox are more or less the same.If you have decided to play a campaign, you are presented with 3 campaigns to pick from World 2020, Global Crisis and Shattered World. (You can mod in more if you wish.) Once you have selected your campaign you can chose from 182, 184, and 248, respectively.You can play as the Superpower of the United States or the weakest of minor powers Malawi.in World 2020 and Global Crisis.OrYou can play as a state in the former United States or a sec of former Russia in Shattered World. There are a lot of nations to choose from, just depends on how you wish to play.Scenario, as its name implies, has a goal to complete within a given deadline.Now you're given 3 main categories. ● Supreme Ruler 2020● Global Crisis● Custom ScenarioEach one has certain scenarios from their own time frame. Of course, Custom Scenario has only custom scenarios.2. GameplayThe gameplay is quite unique. I have yet to find a game that does a real-time strategy like this, it's nice.Let's just say we are playing as South Carolina in the campaign Shattered World. 2.1 Interface2.1.1 TopAt the top center of the screen we have the following; Treasury amount, nation played as, game menu, GPD/c, pause/play, game speed, time and date. All of the above are just information except the time and game menu buttons.2.1.2 BottomOn the left corner/center of the screen, you have a sidebar with tabs of various areas.● Land● Production● Research● Finance● State● Operations● Defense● Unit CommandOnce you have selected one of these the left center/corner will show you the tab and the information related to it. Here you will have the option to change various sliders related to the tab you have selected. Or change the highlighted parts of the map.On the right center/corner of the screen, you have your minimap and your email (notifications).You will receive an email if there is anything of importance happening that the game thinks is important to you. You can change the settings for what you find important or not in the options menu.2.2 EconomyAs South Carolina we have to get a production of coal and metal ore. If we don't we will go into a huge deficit as we are import loads of resources to supply our factories. So we have to build some Metal ore/Coal mines till the demand is met. But, if we are not careful at how many we build we will have to start importing industrial goods, which cost us more money. That is just one aspect of the economy. Before we go to war, we have to make sure that we have the proper supply coverage is provided, the military goods produced to feed our solders, and the unit of solders themselves are trained.It's rather detailed and I have only covered the most basic idea behind the economics behind the game. I don't know the deepest secrets it offers as I have only played around 20 hours of the game.2.3 Research/TechnologyTo be able to build a clean energy building or improve your coal power plants must be researched. Even the equipment your solders use and missiles your planes fire must first be researched as well. (Unless the nation you're playing as starts with the technology.)Researching a technology is simple, it depends on the number of Research Centers you have and if you can afford to pay the employees.Here is a small list of the main technologies you can research.● Warfare● Transportation● Science● Technology● Medical● SocietyEach one is linked to the others in some way. Some are more beneficial than others. It's your job to find out which ones are better for your situation and goals than someone else.There is also another type of research, Unit Design.● Army (Ground)● Naval (Sea bound)● Air Force (flying units)● Missiles (ammunition for missile for various land, air, and sea units)All the categories above have multiple sub tabs in them for example the Army tab has,● Infantry● Recon● Tanks● Anti-Tank● Artillery● Air Defense● TransportWith all these options you can tailor the Army/Navy/Air Force however you wish.2.4 Warfare.Warfare is very limited to how long your economy can support it. And how fast you will win/lose the war depends on the technology you have researched. It requires strong supply lines, some planning, and a bit of luck.After you go to the State tab you can conduct negotiations with other nations, or just declare war. Although, just being aggressive will make you get kicked out of the UN and other nations a valid casus belli.Once you have a valid reason to go to war or you just declared it. You may now order your units to attack and cross the enemy’s borders and slowly moving your nation’s borders over the claimed territory. The map is made of small hexes so it is rather detailed on the terrain you can claim. Each unit has a condition bar which shows you the state they are in and how much manpower they have. If the bar is red you are likely out of supplies. If it is almost empty the unit will soon be destroyed because of the lack of men in the unit.Warfare is like Economics, it has some great details to it. I just cannot do justice explaining all of it.3. Conclusion.I enjoy the game very much. But, the only thing that I find to be a large drag is the fact time moves so slowly even on the highest speed setting. The highlight of the game is the complexity and details they made for us to conquer the world with.This is a wonderful game I enjoy that is made by Battlegoat. It’s a great buy, especially for any real-time grand strategy game fans.4. My Game Scores and Reasons behind them. TLDR; Look here.Gameplay                7/10The game play is amazingly depth. Before you can even think about going to war you must first stablise your economy, have a surplus income, and research and produce the units to attack. I believe that this game delivers the ""Conquer the world or die trying"" idea really well.Music/Sounds           4/10Sounds are nice, they go well with it. They just get repetitive after a while of playing. Just like most other games of this category. Music as well, but that can be fixed with anything you want it to be thanks audio players!Creativity                 8/10A nice and original idea to the real-time grand strategy games are. The creative depth and research that was put into the game was amazing.Graphics                   5/10Okay graphics for a game made in 2008. I suppose if they were much better than they are most computers at that time couldn't handle all the calculations the computer has to make.Replay Value            6/10The replay value of this game is really dependent on the player, for me it's a good bit. But it's still dependent on my ability to set a goal. So it will be yours as well, as I cannot set goals for you.Enjoyment               8/10I enjoy this game and I can see myself coming back to it at least for a hour or 2 each week. Who knows, might even play it for a few hundred hours.Overall                      6/10This game has a lot of potential that is only limited to the players' want to conquer the world and how you want to do it. Diplomacy, War, and Economic Supremacy, but at the end of the day, it's still a war game.!!Funny, I hit the charactor limit.!!References.R1 = http://www.paradoxplaza.com/press/2009/9/supreme-ruler-2020-gold-marches-out-to-retailR2 = http://www.battlegoat.com/supreme_2020_GOLD.php ",604,160,28,105,88,3,161

												I know it says I've played 250+ hours of this game, and I've certainly played quite a few, but probably half of that is letting the game run on its own while I was asleep, or having fallen asleep playing it.The concept behind the game is really great, and I wish it had been implemented in a way that made it fun to play, but it wasn't.I did play the original (SR2010) and it is certainly an improvement over that version - less buggy, better controls. But the core problems with the franchise remain.Basic gameplay is excruciatingly slow; the fastest speed is a tenth of where it should be. Virtually every game mechanic is completely opaque, and zero effort is made to explain any of it. The economic model is absurd and way too easily exploited - even playing as Malawi (the poorest, most technologically backwards country in the world)  I can turn it into an economic powerhouse in just a few game years.Since no effort is made to balance the various countries, conflicts are rather pointless. The AI is terrible no matter how difficult you make the settings. You have to make your own game objectives because the game itself has none.Then there's the ""engineers"" problem - if you lack the tech to build a really good infantry unit, engineers are a very strong infantry unit that can be built with no tech. Although very oddly you can't actually research the unit, you need to trade for the design - but anyone will trade it to you for some cash. The engineer has massive advantages - it's cheap, it can cross rivers, it can bridge terrain for other units, it can accelerate production and repair of buildings, and it can beat the tar out of far more advanced units without breaking a sweat. Why a zero-tech engineer can pound the hell out of many types of advanced infantry units is beyond me. The economy and force distributions aren't the only wildly imbalanced aspects to the game. Research is ridiculous - if you have the cash you can buy and use techs way way way beyond your tech level. Diplomacy is virtually pointless, as is any other form of non-warfare interaction with other countries.The UN mechanic is also dubious, there are no substantial benefits to being a part of the UN, and a significant economic penalty is attached to being good by them, when it should be the other way around. It's to your advantage to purposely get kicked out, so that you don't have to pay their escalating membership fees - for which you get nothing in return. An example of how trying to stay good by the UN hurts you: it's apparently perfectly acceptable for a neighboring country with whom you are not at war to allow passage of enemy units to attack your territory, but if you attack that neighbor for that act of war the UN will despise you for it. Your advisors are just as bad as the AI elsewhere; if you trust them to do anything they will mess it up badly. There's a system of implementing priorities for them, but if this has any actually effect on their behavior I haven't been able to detect it.The only thing this game does well, gameplay-wise, is tactical unit management on the hex map. If you can slog through all the opaque mechanics and the gruelingly long setup time before a typical country can start invading others, that part is reasonably satisfying.Other mechanics, like the loyalty mechanic, are just stupid and appear to directly contradict the ""realism"" goal of the game. Either eliminate that mechanic, or do it properly! Like its predecessor, SR2020 is a great idea that doesn't really work well as implemented.			",4,3,0,7,1,0,4

												Honestly, this is a great game for people who really love strategy games. It goes so insanely deep with you having control over every little thing, and it's just astonishing how much you can really do. Scenarios, diplomacy, products your empire carries, imports/exports, and what's great is that most of that you don't even have to keep doing yourself, because your advisors can take care of most of it (With some guidance, of course. Don't make that economic advisor bond your nation to debt now...) And with how much you can do in the military! It's great being able to micromanage everything. Plus, it's real-time, and all the wars happen at once. There's no turns like in the other games like Civ, and you can really do a lot at once. And, if you really love global RTS, you get all the nations, plus some scenarios to make the world even more varied than before, like a ""Shattered world"" map. If you don't want to take the time to learn it, then of course you'll hate it. But once you get it, it's a load of fun every time you play it.			",66,7,0,5,22,0,14

												An impressive game with it's scale, it's rather difficult at first, the learning curve is steep if your coming from a Sid Meir game, but once you get the hang of it, your better prepared for trying your hand at Victoria 2. Unlike Victoria 2, the ultimate goal of this game is world conquest, that is your goal, but don't just invade countries willy nilly now, that's rather stupid. You have to take it slow and plan far ahead, that's what I like about this game, not to mention the research and trade systems. Seriously, have you ever sent the United States 1,100,000 barrels of oil in exchange for top notch military designs? Seriously oil is worth more then money in this game, the game is somewhat predictable, if your Russia and playing the Global Crisis scenario, China will usually invade you, but things can happen differently, depending on factors such as your military production, because a nation can become rather hostile to you out of fear of your military, it's a very indepth, somewhat complex, but yet surprisingly easy to learn, rousing goodtime of a Grand Strategt RTS.

												Probably the most underappreciated grand strategy games of all time, largely due to the relatively rudimentary graphics. But make no mistake, this game has a level of strategic depth that will melt your face! Also one of the best national economic simulators ever. If you like grand strategy, economics, and/or war, then you owe it to yourself to get this game. Beware though, it is not for the faint of heart. No one has ever just jumped into this game and said, ""Oh yeah, I totally understand how this game works."" I probably logged 50 hours before I truly had a grasp of the core mechanics, and then only with the assistance of a lot of online research/forum reading... TOTALLY WORTH IT!			",311,68,1,53,77,2,96

												So...this game is really good actually...here is what happened on my most recent playthrough I started:Started the game off as Germany in 2020 Sandbox.Got a few reserves ready scattered a little around Berlin and Munich and a little around the Western borders.Deployed 3 Tornado jets ready with missiles in Kiel.Played for 9 days in-game (Like 15 mins), it is now the 9th of January 2020, and I have made an alliance with Poland, France, UK and USA. But as soon as the 9th of January actually came along, I that Belarussian forces were entering Poland with T-72s and Grad Rockets. So, a week later (10 mins), I sent 5 Eurofighter Typhoons escorting 3 Tornado attack jets fitted with missiles ready to launch to Warsaw. 2 of my Eurofighters were shot down before they destroyed a coloum of 4 T-72s, which was a distraction as my other Eurofighters escorted my 3 Tornados to the southern border with Poland, where they blew up a town killing 10,000 civilians before returning to the allied airbase in Warsaw.By now, it's the 16th of January, and I have around 20 units of A1 Leopard tanks fighting a few kilometres East of Warsaw, as I see Ukrainian T-72s and numerous BTRs enter the Belarus southern border. As 4 villages are instantly lost to the advancing Ukrainians, I send in 2 units of Artillery to bombard a town nearby the Ukrainian forces.A day after, I enter into an alliance with Ukraine, sending 30 units of several types of BTRs to reinforce the Ukrainian advance which is now sieging the enemy capital.But the attack is repelled as 3 nukes hit ares around Kiev!As soon as the nukes land, I see numerous tanks and other war vechicles from the small Russian area just North of Poland advancing south heading straight to Warsaw!So now, I get really annoyed, and send 20 carpet bombers all the way from Berlin to bomb 3 towns in that Russian area with several missiles, killing 80,000 innocent Russian people. As the war rages on, I end up sending another 50 units of A1 Leopards into Belarus, taking their capital, and fighting the Russian frontline as UK enters the war on my side, attacking Leningrad with paratroopers.So far so good, and guess what...it's only the 1st of February! I love this game!960/376 would nuke Moscow again ",46,3,0,9,14,0,24

Posted: July 19, 2014
												First of all, please, do not be fooled by my low play time - I bought the game quite some time ago and have played it for hundreds of hours. And I am long standing fan of the series, starting SR2010, now playing SR1936.To sum it up, my recommendation is positive, but, please, read more as there are few objections and e.g. Bjoern has quite a few valid points. I would not recommend this game to just anyone.The game is very ambitious, wide in scope and quite complex with sharp learning curve. Of course you can assign some tasks to AI, but why let computer play my game? Especially as decisions of AI advisors are often quite poor. In general, game more or less delivers what it promises - choose any country and run it as you wish in global environment.However, there is quite a feel of unfinisheness in some aeas. I think the scope of project was too wide to deliver within set  budget and timeframe. Quite a few ideas are implemented only partially or got axed in full (NBC, environment, tourism and business centers... )Now, to cover aspects of the game:Research: there are several hundreds of technlogies and units in technology tree, but their effect is very often ""research and forget"" without any significant effect. Still, quite a few technologis do have very visible effect. As for the units, you can do well enough with lets say 7 units for most of the game (see warfare). Researching hundreds of unit models covered in game is marginally interesting. Tech level is a bit strange concept - it is possible to have tech level of year 1990 and run phaser hover  tanks... Diplomacy is quite strange (but I fail to recall any 4X game with really working diplomacy model, and I played many of them - Galciv probably got closest). E.g. casus belli is mostly based on active unit production capacity which gives way to many exploits (as AI is unable to control this aspect), but you will always face up ""all computer coalition"" in the end. However, I find diplomacy no better or worse than in any 4X game.Economy is based (I believe) on Joseph Stiglitz theories. General idea is the more government spends, the better economy performs. Economy view aside, this leads to not very realistic in game strategies and exploits. It is very easy to start as - e.g. - Madagascar and triple GDP/c in a year. Moreover, there is very nasty bug related to price mechanism which I will cover later. I do feel economy to be somewhat ovrsimplified, but working (but mind you, I am economy geek :) ). Warfare is acceptable. Building few hundreds of APC (preferably laser ones) and several naval transports is enough to conquer the world. Everything else is just nice to have. Long range AA and fighters helps limit APC loses against air powers, few dozens of stealth srategy bombers (B-2) are great to override entranched aeas. I found very limited use for tanks, and no use for AT, Recon, most naval units, range AA and most of the aircrafts... There is just no real need to build these types of units. AI does its job to provide resistence, but is by no means real oponent. As for the nasty, game and save breaking bug I mentioned before... Using artifical production buildings (like synth fuel factory) does increase the final product price. This has positive feedback to output price of buildings which use his product as input (e.g. oil power plant), especially, if it the only input. If ANY country manages to create ""closed circle"" - like most of the oil produced in synth fuel plant, most of the electricity (used in synth fuel plant) produced in oil power plant - prices will get out of any reasonable range. GDP skyrockets and after several weeks treasury of this country will get out of range which game can handle. This destroys world market and after another few weeks, population gets out of control (not sure if by standard game mechanisms or the data just get overwritten). The game is not salveable in this state. There are workarounds (either conquer the country before it gets there - only handful of countires can get into this loop), or casually check the countries and if they start going this way, load one month old save in multiplayer mode and destroy these buildings. BTW, with careful handling this bug can be used as exploit to get unlimited treasury. The most usual culprit is Moscow, by the year 2029. IMHO this bug should not have escaped testing. Apart of this bug, I found game stable, if resouce hungry.To sum it up, even as I highlighted some negatives, my overall feeling of the game is positive and - as I bought it for 22 euros and now just added to my steam collection for 2.5 - one of the best values for a buck despite its flaws. I would not hesitate to recommend buy for any global 4X games fan, who can handle limits of the game. And I hope Batlegoat will continue to improve the engine as Paradox did with Europe Univrsalis or HoI.			",73,44,3,127,71,1,92

												Absolutely a great game, extremely in depth strategy that is difficult to master but feels so rewarding. If you buy this game prepare to grind through rough times before you understand the game, and be ready to watch plenty of barely helpful youtube videos to try to understand it all. It'll be hard but once it all clicks amazing things happen. Protip: Blitzkrieging only works a couple of times early in game. Once you get later in game you will need high level artillery and nukes so start researching and building them early. When you're ready build a wall of infantry and armor and place your artillery behind them and move up slowly while obliterating anything in your path. It took me 9 months (in game) of shelling Moscow to get it to fall. Have fun!			",37,1,0,3,4,0,21

												This has definately climbed the ranks as one of my fave strategy games of all time.  The moment I got into this, I was really hooked.  The depth and detail is just superb and engaging.  Pretty much every country in the world is playable from the year 2008 and in Shattered Worlds scenario ( which is awesome ), US States are playable, Canadian provinces are playable and even certain European cities are to.It provides a great ""What If"" scenario and puts you in charge of your nations hot seat.  Research, Military, Diplomacy, Trade and Re-Election are all a thing to this game.The game is very slow paced however.  This is not a game like a Rome Total war where you have around 3 months of a year go at one turn, no, this game is days at a time.  You have to have paitence and you cannot rush it.  But it makes it so rewarding in the end.Do recommend, go forth and conquer the world!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game in my opinion is extremely underrated. It is a grand strategy, and as you can expect you can play as any nation you want too. be it Argentina, Germany, Russia, Haiti, Afganistan, Niger, Somalia, Israel. any modern country you have intrest in, well you can bet it'll be in this game.You control your government in every way, economic, research, the millitary, Diplomacy, and espionage.  and while the game does take some time to get used too, if you stick too it, then im sure you will come back and play it over and over.

												One of my favorite games that in the past i purchased. Buggy as hell but still a great game i bought for myself and friends to play. Pick it up its only $11 im sure you will love it if your a fan of hardcore geopolitical sims! My Final Verdict is 8/10 Only Reason its not 10/10 is because of the buggyness and the Dev team not coming out with enough patches and leaving the game reletivly unfinished,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Supreme ruler 2020, how long have I been searching for a game like you...The answer is about 3 or four years. So what is this super-duper game then?You can take any country in the world (even Andorra, never even knew that existed, its between France and Spain) and command it economically and politcally and militarily. But the best thing is that for once IT IS SET IN THE PRESENT, which makes it more intriguing. No longer are there obvious antagonist states such as Japan Germany or the USSR. You have to make them powerful. Obviously there is North Korea, absoloutely a must play. and China and Russia who are fun to play as. The real excitment lies in playing as Britain or France and attacking europe.Graphically it is incredibly intense, maybe not in the same way as battlefield (the water is terrible), but displaying litterally TENS OF  THOUSANDS  of units can destroy your computer.You can also play with real life military units. They are much better than some games (the sort that have light medium and heavy tanks) in that you can take american aircraft carriers and Russian tanks and then throw them into battle so it is one enormous, accurate, set of toy soldiers.What could be better?

												Supreme Ruler 2020 is a grand strategy game- what that means is that you get to take control of any country in the world and lead them to global dominance. (Or local dominance if you don't want to get sucked up in a really long match.) The challenge in the game is turning your nation into the best by correcting a faltering economy, and by creating an army that no other can hope to challenge. I used to recommend not getting this on Steam, but there's absolutely no reason to avoid getting it on Steam since it was updated! It's good fun if you're up for a reasonably simple but in-depth experience at trying your hand at playing a modern nation... or if you're feeling nationalistic, one of the split-off parts of a larger country. I personally love taking Oregon and conquering the American Northwest.			",260,76,4,47,18,0,48

												ive been playing this for quite some time now. Since i am a fan of strategy games i decided to give this game a go and i am very glad i did! the AI is a bit weird at times though. when they declare war theyll start attacking, and when that force gets defeated, theyre done. no more invasion for them. that so far is the only downside ive seen. it has been pretty fun to take some random country, like Romania, and make them a new world superpower and empire! the economy works great, unit supply is a little weird but still works, and the ministers are awesome when youre not yelling at them for sending your units in the middle of the sahara for no reason or crashing your economy. also half the time i play this it seems like they just send them away from the fight at half health, but oh well			",15,7,0,4,12,0,5

												You're going to need a good weekend off before you check out this ""Bad Larry""! The game is great, it is very in-depth economically and technologically and I have had a lot of fun with it, however, this is not your typical real time strategy and you will be waiting a lot for things in game to complete such as techs, units, and buildings. So if you want to just pick up the game and go this might not be for your average strat player, it's stylized along the same lines as the old school WW II games which does indeed involve strategy and a lot of planning to ""acquire"" your neighbor's territory. For people who like to play video games and do things around the house like me this is perfect for you, as long as you're not at war you can literally let the game play itself and just watch your country grow. Other than that it's a good quality game that I would give an 88/100!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very hard game only for the true strategy gamer. Supreme Ruler is a game that combines rts and board game type senerios with the best world map I have ever seen in a game. The way the game is set up is you choose a nation and begin conquest. Very impressive nation managing. Makes you believe your a real ruler of a nation with all the hardship and glory. Best played with freinds, not many online games but lan works fine plus you will not simply win a game in a day. The game also features hundreds of scenerios which my personal favorite shatterd world where everyone is thier own nation even the United States is split up into fifty countries.

Because it is a little dated, the servers are not up anymore, but there is some software you and your friend can get for that problem! (And it's free.) So, should you get this game? YES.

It goes down to earning money by screwing over your people. But be careful, they like to leave. Third, the military game play is amazing. The countries will actually get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and refuse diplomatic offers! But, if you declare war on too many countries, the other countries start declaring war on you. So play wisely...

												This game (and every other game in this series) seem to be a small view of the great things that could have come with this game. This game had the potential to be an extremely in-depth geopolitical grand strategy game. Instead, it is a hollow game about military conquest and making money, masked by a clutter of interface options all showing stats of little to absolutely no significance.This game also feels as if the developers were currently working on a feature, and decided ""HEY! Lets add this!"" and completely forgot about the task at hand, or could not be bothered to finish said task. A prime example would be the environment system. You may think, ""Why, there is none!"" and you would be mostly right, however with many Society technologies, they all have to do with the environment, and some even have to do with nuclear fallout (another thing that is not to be seen). And some of the techs say, in the ""effects"" portion of the tech, ""Environmental rating +x%"". Well, why would they say it has these effects even though most of these techs dont do anything? Well, the answer is simple. The developers were working on environmental effects to your actions and the actions of other nations, and these technologies would help the global environmental situation. And by hints from the technology, nuclear fallout would be an issue too. However, the developers either did one of two things. They either thought ""lets put this in, and this, and this"" but never went back to the task at hand (as I said earlier) or had a hard time creating these systems (which I imagine would be complicated) and gave up completely. Not even bothering to remove the technologies that talk about environmental impact, blah, blah, blah.Also, many (probably a majority) of the technologies have literally no impact. It is literally useless fluff put into the game and branded with a sign saying ""THIS DOES SOMETHING"" however, it doesnt. Yes, I grant you there are also MANY technologies that do a lot, however if you look at the grand strategy games put out by Paradox Interactive, every single technology has a large impact and is essential. And all in all, this game is largely unfinished. The developers did update it years ago, however they still left behind the game, and left it very hollow indeed. They moved on to create THREE new titles, all as hollow as this, but with a shiny new interface, map, and a better AI (which is TERRIBLE in 2020, by the way).Sure, this game can be fun to play even now. However the bad practices that Battlegoat has proceeded with for 4 games (Not sure about SR2010) should not go unnoticed. Practices such as, leaving behind an unfinished game, using said unfinished features and leaving them in other titles (environmental impact ""modifiers"" still implemented in their SR titles to date). I would also rant about how they pulled Supreme Ruler Ultimate from Early Access and ""releasing"" it in an extremely unfinished state, however I have a review on that game for you already.All in all, I would not reccoment anybody to support the bad practices Battlegoat has gone through with many times, and I urge you to turn away from this game and have a look at Paradox Interactive's titles instead. They are very finished, always releasing updates, finishing their games, and have many features. I am sorry Battlegoat but I despise games being left unfinished. Especially 4 games in a row. I would be weary when thinking of buying a game from this company in the future.			",82,6,2,10,39,0,31

												Not intuitive.  It's almost impossible to figure out how to load units onto boats to fight across the ocean. very little help exists outside of the game, as people explain the apparent and obvious reasons it doesn't work.  I need to know why it doesn't work when everything seems like it should.  Like why sometimes i can load troops onto transport ships, and it says ""40k ton vehicals fit!"" and yet my 3k ton tank isn't allowed on. Wars seem to go on forever, which is part of the fun.  Game is so close to being everything I was looking for, but large scale invasions are impossible, unless you want to take 3 hours of your time moving individual units onto air crafts and boats, and then have to deal w/ them not fitting even though it should.  The game is designed so you have to basically daisy chain supplies w/ your outgoing forces, while you build up reserves, so it's like they want you to make giant invasion forces, but make the process just so god awful.  Don't bother unless you're a fan of the series, because they didn't really change much.			",94,27,1,29,31,1,45

												I recently wrote another review for this game but today i decided to delete the old one and write a new and more accurate one. This game has major issues, but i could've left those asside and just play the game, thanks to it's beautiful complexity. The problem is that the developers of this game have implemented something to stop players from hacking the game, problem which will fallow you even when you buy the game .I tried all tactics from the internet to fix the issue and even more, I've send 3 emails to battlegoat support team , and i waited for weeks only to see that they don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their costumers! Shame on you battlegoat support team! This not how you treat your costumers! Today i asked Steam to refund my money, as i bought a game that can not be played. Nice piece of bussiness Battlegoat!

												Rating:  7/10I strongly recommend to buy the newer Supreme Ruler:  Cold War over thisPros:*Supreme Ruler makes you the leader of a nation and for people who have played games like Age of Empires will find this much more complex, game features tax system along with social services and puts you in charge of your military, education, and healthcare spending and much more*Game lets you research weapons like Nukes, powerful tanks, missiles to fight REAL WORLD countries today as any country you wish to play as*You could play as Russia and make alliances with the former Soviet states and wage war against Europe and the U.S and take over the entire world, but will the United Nations and countries be happy and continue trading with you?*Game lets you take controls of several units in Real-time and order them to launch a nuke on a city or perhaps ask you artilery to bombard a town where there is enemy garrison or even ask your jets bomb the enemies tanks to oblivion, its all up to you and your choices*Play with Friends online to wage war against each other and see who could conquer the world or maybe ally with your friends and help each other's countries take over the worldCons:*Regardless of wether you have a beast P.C time in the game passes by slow and this is due to the engine, this is especially frustaring in Multiplayer where playing on the fastest speed can result in waiting for 2 minutes for a day to pass*Graphics are not that good, but certainly not horrible, the newer Supreme Ruler:  Cold War has improved graphics when it comes to terrain*For people who would like to play in a more real-life world it can be irritating, the problem is that it is routine for countries around the world to all ally with each other wether it be Jamaica and Iraq or Japan and Nigeria*Playing online is not very simple, it involves having to get third party software like Hamachi or GamesRanger to play with your friend or anyone in factUltimately get this game if you have an imagination and crave being able to be put in charge of a country in a real-life sandbox, but do not expect a Triple A game that runs smoothly and has stunning graphics, you have to have an interest or liking for complex grand strategy games			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have given this series so many attempts because of the concept being very interesting. It fails at deliverying the ease of use and understand that is crutial to strategy games. The UI is really the killer of this series and especially this title. The UI is clunky and nothing really tells you what it does, It lacks the refinement to help you understand what is going on.
