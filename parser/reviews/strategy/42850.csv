												Similar to it's fellow HOI2 mod Darkest Hour, AoD is HOI2 with some pretty nice improvements. While DH added more actual game content (including WW1), AoD focuses more on improving upon what already existed in HOI2. The result is that the WW2 you fight in this is a better experience than the vanilla game, and that was an excellent game already. With that said, I prefer Darkest Hour to this simply because there is more stuff there even if it is not quite as well-polished as it is here.Strategy nerds and fellow psychos will find much to like here. It's old, but still good. :)			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												on the negative side:- It is a bit hard to learn if you are not familiar with hearts of iron series of games. it has some kind of tutorial, but that is nowhere enough to understand all the features.- no fancy graphics [well, you may even say no graphics at all, as you will turn out the animated sprites after a fer hours of gameplay and use counters to represent units/armies as they are much more informative at a glance.- a game can take very long from start to finishBut if you don't mind a long learning curve, and have a lot of time this is easily one of the best strategy games you can find.It is a big improvement over HoI2 in all areas. If you liked HoI2 you will love this.			",24,1,0,8,0,0,6

												I come at this as one who originally played HoI3 followed by Darkest Hour. AoD focuses very much on domestic and economic issues (repairing provinces, civic investment as a means to alleviating dissent as opposed to simply cranking out consumer goods). It's really sliders galore. The implimentation of over-arching, nation-wide policies is also nice.What this game could use, however, is a bit more UI polish. To use the technology tree as an example -- colors seem stark and non-period while useability refinements such as historical years within each tech's respective title should have been implimented. The AI also makes questionable ahistoric decisions, leaving history-minded players stuck. If you're open-minded and wanting unpredictablity though, that might be right up your alley.All that being said, I recommend this to players wanting diplomatic and policy-heavy gameplay without losing military action.

												If you play Hearts of Iron III, you just might find this version more fun if you're playing by yourself. Being able to escape the confines of history by going into the 50's and 60's gets crazy with the Cold War gone hot.  Plus the tech tree is much more fleshed out, and you can more easily (with time and patience) play as micro powers. Politics are also a tad more interesting. Overall I was very surprised by this little gem.			",44,1,0,13,10,0,33

												WW2 Grand Strategy at it's finest. It's hard to change the course of history, compared to some other games of this type - but it's possible.What else to say - hundreds of different types of authentic WW2 units, events, research tree, leaders. So many different tactics and strategies you can adopt.C.O.R.E. Mod is highly recommended, it just makes everything better, expands the game, adds a ton more historical events, makes all the unit and research options, combat system more authentic.

												Very thorough remake of Hearts of Iron 2 - it is wider and deeper than original game, which itself is very wide and deep in terms of every fan of turn-based global strategies.It was released not as mod but as a separate game due to significant amount of gameplay changes above the original HOI2 game. And it is still under development! Get me right - Arsenal of Democracy is a finished product, yet there are always room for some improvements and additional campaigns and stuff. And yeah, community is friendly, and welcome for any newcomers, but...But I won't recommend you to start with Paradox games from this title. There are way too many options, details, charts and graphs to sink in... So you'll get by better starting from Europa Universalis 3 or even Victoria 2, than with Arsenal of Democracy.So I do recommend the game - but only for prepared ones, who grown up above the basic things Civilization taught us, and ready to spend dozens or even hundreds of hours on single separate scenario, making his own history. There are so many scenarios and mods to prove yourself on... And if you'll be not getting enough, you can always make some of your own.Finally, I must inform you that there are a major bug still troubling some players - a flickering screen problem. For some people the game works straight out of box, some have to go to Paradox forums and download patches (Steam is releasing 1.04 version now, and current patch on Paradox is 1.09 or maybe 1.10 already). And for some systems flickering goes on forever, like how it goes with my laptop. So I warn you! There is a possibility that this game will be unplayable, no matter how great it is...My mark is 8/10. I'd like to give the game more, but flickering bug is still a big issue, even after 5+ years after game release.			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												I learned to play this style of game on Hearts of Iron I.  It was difficult to navigate at best.  My friend, who is a code monkey, and I had discussed adding changes to the game that we would find helpful.  The next thing you know, most of them did happen in HOI2.  I was hooked.  Darkest Hour and Arsenal of Democracy are both fantastic.  If you appreciate a top-down strategy game, this is for you.  It can be a pain in the butt to learn (~10 hours), but it is well worth it.Disclaimer: I am a history teacher.			",51,1,1,3,12,0,25

												Never Cared Much for the Hears of Iron games. But this version of Hearts of Iron 2 is spectacular. Choose a country you want to be. Most that existed are in the game. Go grab a co-op buddy or buddies and fight out world war 2...If you are good enough you can do just about anything you can imagine. 8/10 it's good for what it is. but it's not without its bugs or glitches. in the 100 hours played my game has crashed about 5 times but it has a good autosave system.*i have now played a bit of Darkest hour, the other major mod for hearts of iron 2. I enjoyed AoD a lot more. if you want world war one gameplay then i would recommend darkest hour. if you just want a world war 2 grand strategy then this game is the way to go.*IMPORTANT!:Just wanted to add that contrary to popular belief the game was not abandoned. I don't know the technical details but they just aren't posting updates to steam.1.09 Was released in June (2015): https:// forum. paradoxplaza. com/ forum/ index. php?threads /development -of- aod-1-09.661336/Just paste this to your browser, remove all spaces and enjoy.Note: you may need a paradox account to download.

												Arsenal of Democracy: A Hearts of Iron Game. The hint is in the title, a Hearts of Iron game. This is not really a game however, Arsenal of Democracy is a free mod available to all Hearts of Iron 2 players and this retail version only has a few minor advantages over the free version.If you want to know whether this game is for you then you should not be reading this review, rather you should find a review for the regular Hearts of Iron 2, everything said in there is true for this game. With one notable exception however, none of the Hearts of Iron 2 mods will work for this.It is a strange sense, to pay money for the retail version of a mod only to be denied access to, what is otherwise one of the strongest modding scenes around. Arsenal of Democracy does have some mods available made specifically for this game but they are few and far between and none have the scope or polished quality that is readily available for Hearts of Iron 2.All in all, do not buy this, simply don't. If you are such a big fan of the genre that you must play every incarnation out there then save yourself some money, go get Hearts of Iron 2 instead and download the Arsenal of Democracy mod free of charge, you won't be missing out on much and should you want a slightly different total conversion of the World War 2 Grand Strategy experience, you simply download another mod.

												This game was great to begin with, but it has recently undergone some major updates in the form of version 1.09. Sadly the latest patch is not available on Steam, but it can be downloaded from Paradox forums, where you can register your game and get access to the patches https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/arsenal-of-democracy.462/There is even a 1.10 patch in early alpha stage, the patch will attempt to adress the ancient bugs and problems with the game engine.Graphics arent anything wonderfull, but this is about grand strategy, not fancy fireworks.Game in itself is straight up Hearts of Iron, if your a Paradox fan, then you will love AoD aswell. Multitude of variation in strategy, tactics, diplomacy, large techtree, plenty of unit types and so much little details to think of that after years of playing, you still learn new things every now and then. It has the best replayability value that I have ever seen in a strategy game. If you have not played Paradox games before, then you are up for a long and hard path of learning the game, but it is very much worth it.The AI is not terribly challenging once you master the game, the difficulty setting just grants it more bonuses rather than intelligence, but luckily there are alot of mods that improve the AI and gameplay generally, such as my own mod which can be downloaded here:https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/improved-1936.673291/Best way to enjoy this game however is in multiplayer, there are various forums where you can sign up and try to find an MP game to join, Paradox forum is a good place to start. You need GameRanger to get access to online game as the game itself has no lobby function anymore.In multiplayer the game springs to life, as you can co-op as Axis or Allies, or a desperate struggle as Poland/Czechoslovakia with your friend, the choices are limitless. But best games are the ones where all the major powers are controlled by a human player, that is where things get real. The games progress relatively slowly due to amount of players, but in also forces you to cooperate with your allies and form plans and strategies which can be equally fun as playing the game itself.All in all, this is my favourite WW2 Grand strategy game and has been since its release. No other game has come even close, so I can recommend it with all my heart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Page 2 of the manual explains which ports to open in order to play online, but I was unable to play with a friend over the internet after we both forwarded the correct ports. However, I was able to connect 3 computers in a LAN game over my wireless network. Even as a singleplayer experience this game is still enjoyable, and can be run easily on almost any Windows system.

												To correct several reviews below: This game WILL run on modern displays, the resolution can be changed in the launcher in the games folder. For some reason Steam skips this and launches the game .exe. To do this right click on the game in Steam and go to properties. In properties go to the local files tab and click browse local files. In the games files look for Arsenal.exe.This launcher will allow you to change the resolution to suit a modern display.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know there is already a World War 1 mod out there, but that ends in 1922, it would be really nice to have one that starts in say around 1913 and go through 1963.

If you like the Hearts of Iron series this is a good pickup if you have always wanted to continue your game for a longer period of time.  In the older versions you had to pretty much use cheats in order to take over the world but not in this one, you get plenty of time to spread your empire through conquest.			",10,3,0,4,4,0,3

Unfortunately, while the game was being updated up until 2010, it no longer runs properly on monitors with higher resolution than HD, making the game unplayable on modern PCs due to overscan issues.Since Paragon are still holding their hands out for money for this game, and accepting it, but not updating the game so it runs properly, thumbs down is the only viable option.

It has a sister game Darkest Hour wich offers a faster gameplay. For those that Enjoy a good WW2 experience I can recommend both and even HOI3 or 4 nowadays. It's charming and appeal it's great that even today I keep going back to it.Also another game I was able to make Brazil Great and what it should be after all these years without a corrupt government :)			",434,99,6,150,94,4,187

												Love this version of the game and highly recommend it to anyone into strategic war games.Though i continue to be plagued by the Americans when ever i play as the Germans... Latest Game:Year 1943 January - Germany controls Europe (only Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, England/Ireland and Finland not occupied), control north Africa along with Italy. Pushed the Soviets back passed Moscow and only getting sparse resistance from this at this point - also control most of the middle east. The US finally enters the war on the side of the allies (something i had been expecting since 1941).Year 1943 April - United States performs Torch Landings in North Africa (Casablanca), brush away the 3 divisions of garrison infantry (1941 tech level) - with 6 mixed divisions of their own. I move my quick response army group - comprised of elite mechanized and armored divisions, 12 of them in total under Rommel (level 6 general) to hit them - expecting to crush them (as to date my groups like that have crushed anything they have ran into) - the 6 american units blast the snot ouf of my quick response unit. Im a little shocked, but things happen in war - luckly i had two slower moving army groups near the area and moved them to intercept the american force will withdrawing my battered 12 divisions...  hit the americans with a further 24 divisions comprised of mix forces, artillery. AT, assault guns, ect..ect.. still going up against 6 divisions... get my♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to me again. Double check my intel on USA - agents tell me im more advanced than them in tech in all areas of ground combat - so totally confused at the loses.Year 1943 July - American forces have pushed me back to italian held north africa. Ive halted my advance into russia and agree to peace treaty with them and start moving units from the eastern front back to the western front. British try landing near Gibraltar, but i crush it with garrison forces. But for what ever anything i throw at the americans bounces off. Had a total of 40 divisions in north africa get pushed back... even after i diverted 90% of my luftwaffe to strike them (from what i could tell i had complete air superiority).Year 1943 December (Present) - US forces control North africa all the way to the suez. Repeat review of intel tells me im still more advanced than the americans in every category of ground technology. Even with fortress in tubruk and such, the US army just rolls over me repeatedly. I have nearly 70 divisions sitting across the Suez, most have been sitting there for weeks - so fully supplied and rested. But some how i suspect the US is just gonna roll over me again. (and usually they hit me with at most 6-10 divisions per engagement). British try repeatedly to attack in norway and france, and get squashed every time... then the US lands in Spain and steam rolls the defenses i have there too...again swatting away 12 panzer divisions like they were nothing.Have no idea why i cant beat the US forces. Though its been fun actually getting pushed across Africa, though i was hoping for successful counter attacks a few times - especially when i starrted throwing my very experience russian front unit at them... never been handed my♥♥♥♥♥♥so badly before.

												Arsenal of Democracy is a community-made, improved version of Hearts of Iron 2. If you enjoy Hearts of Iron 2 and grand strategy games in general, you'll enjoy Arsenal of Democracy. If you're not a fan of either, then the extremely steep learning curve will and the endless micromanagement inherent to this game will probably turn you off quickly. Personally I'm not a big fan of Hearts of Iron 2. Where the grand strategy genre---which is effectively dominated by Paradox Interactive---is concerned, I recommend Europa Universalis 4 or Crusader Kings 2 instead.			",71,10,0,17,11,0,37

												Over all, fun but buggy. Second, kinda bad, but HIGHLY addictive. Everyone has their fav contries, and in this game you can play as them, and even conquer the whole damn world, and that is fun as hell.Good things: -Historically accurate, but still can change the history if you wanted.-Hyper realistic, maybe littlebit too much, since it takes FOREVER to make a one single division of Infrantry.Bad things: -Many bugs-United Kingdom,France, much annoy			",124,26,17,17,33,2,24

												По сравнению с DH она выглядит попроще, но это только внешне. Да, с виду AoD не привнес ничего нового по сравнению с предыдущими версиями Hearts of Iron 2: карта осталась та же, кампании те же, добавились только новые бригады, новые задания для войск... вроде все.Но зато следует отметить, что в AoD ИИ гораздо умнее, чем в DH. В смысле от него можно ожидать больше сюрпризов типа внезапной высадки американцев не в Нормандии и даже не в Алжире, а в Конго. Поэтому я играю и в ту, и в другую.			",250,34,21,45,85,0,153

												9 of 10The game is very in-depth with managing your country without sacrificing the military part of the game. The only thing that keeps it from a full 10 is that there is no editor for AoD like the first Hearts of Iron and the worst part is that the description is a lie. There is NO editor with the game nor is there a seperate editor tool, the only way to edit is the old fashioned way, screwing around with save game files using wordpad and/or notepad.Even without a real editor however you can still accomplish a great deal with wordpad editing with hoi 1 and 2, something hoi 3 lacks is the freedom to edit with wordpad (most hoi 3 files, mainly the save games and scenario files, are   in a file format not compatable with wordpad.)Overall it is better than the successor, hoi 3 in every way except map graphics, particularly because the regions in hoi 3 on the US dont take into account the accurate shape of the states where in all hoi games precedding, the states are accurately shaped by region and province shape.They should remove from the list of features that (or at least rephrase it to point out that the files are wordpad editable instead of insinuating a non-existant editor) the hints of an editor that doesn't exist before someone decides to bash them with false advertisement OR solve the problem altogether by making an editor for AoD much like the first Hearts of Iron Scenario Editor which had an interactive map in which to set province ownership and the like.If an editor exists for AoD then I would appreciate anyone messaging me or leaving a comment on my profile if the former is not possible with information on where to get it.Aside from the lies about an editor however the game is great and is both historical and ahistorical as the AIs don't always make the same choices every game, meaning a lot of ""what-if"" scenarios can happen (Like the possibility of Germany mobilizing late, Stalin deciding not to purge his officers or Japan not attacking Pearl Harbor, though the major historical events the AI usually chooses the historical outcome often.)So all in all, great game, 9 out of 10, if they put in a user-friendly editor to make the lies not lies, then it would be a 10, until they decide to do that however, it remains an imperfect yet high 9/10.I highly reccomend this game with or without an editor due to the large array of choices you have at your disposal when managing your country (such as taking steps to turn america into a dictatorship, or being a non-insane hitler who focuses on the USSR instead of world domination or even playing as the Soviets and being the reason for WW2 instead of germany or even the very difficult yet still possible scenario where France doesn't become a cheese eating surrender monkey and actually fights the second world war.)

												I wish it was more engaging.  I   r e a l l y   like these types of games that have depth in detail,, supply, logistics, research and development and so on.  weather!!!  Too!  The weather details.  Even without 3D graphics, this is ok.  The detailed 2D weather indications and effects on the units is it!  There is a game that models,, to where you can bring the ships into dry dock and add the latest in technologies.  You can also bring them into dock and load crew and equiptment.  I's all 2D, but the depth of the details brings it to life in a way moreso than a boring 3D model that is,,  not much.			",3,0,1,1,11,0,10

												I tried getting into this, but, it's just not that fun. I don't regret playing it but I doubt I'll ever go back and play it again. I expected something complex to understand but  a game that would build up into something fun and what I got was something that was okay to learn and barely fun at all. Don't buy this unless you already know you like it, you want to support Paradox Interactive, or if you collect HOI games.All this being said I am looking forward towards the next entry into the series that's set for release late 15 early 16?

												There is cleary a lot of content here, and it seems to be a labor of love. That said, there are some issues here that make it difficult for me to recommend. Most of these issues boil down to learning curve and how much time you're willing to commit to figuring the game out. There are a few in-game tutoials, and the manual is easy enough to find on-line, but it's still a very difficult game to get your arms around. The tutorials are enough to get you started, but probably cover about 1% of the in game scenarios. The manual gives a broad overview, but didn't shed any light on issues that I had with playability. I found units behaving contrary to orders that I was giving frequently. I had no doubt that the behavior was rational given the rules of the game, but became frustrated trying to figure it out without any feedback from the game. This was a shame, because the level of effort put into historical accuracy is impressive, as is the amount of control the designers are trying to offer. I really wanted to like this game, but after three hours of wrestling with the interface, I decided to try something else. Maybe I gave up too soon, but with the number of available games on Steam at this price point, it seemed like I was needlessly banging my head against the wall instead of enjoying myself.
