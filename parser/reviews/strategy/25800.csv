												I know this applies to a very small population of Steam users, but for those of you who have Macs; don't buy this version. Europa Universalis 3 is amazing,  but this version is far from being the ""Complete"" version. The App store sells the ""Chronicles"" version. ""Chronicles"" contains ALL of the expansions. If you want the full experience of Europa Universalis 3, buy ""Chronicles"" on the App store. Other than that I highly recommend EU3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, this game is very complex and takes some time to truly understand how it works.  In the end I have to say it is one of my fav games of all time.  Yes EU4 is out, I would recomend EU3 over EU4.  I own both and 4 is great but its missing all the stuff thats in 3.  This is one of the best strategy simulation games out there.  If your into this I recomend this game.			",81,8,1,15,33,0,44

												I want to create a nation of peace and prosperity but some retard declares war on me, I destroy them, my infamy goes up. Another retard declares war on me, I destroy them too and my infamy goes up. Then another retard warns me not to go on any wars because my infamy is too high, then attacks me, I destroy them and my infamy goes up. And again and again.I felt like the silent kid that sits at the back of the class and gets bullied all the time and when he finally gets fed up with the bullies he rips the balls of the bully and feeds them to the dogs of the neighborhood.♥♥♥♥ you France, ♥♥♥♥ you Hungary, ♥♥♥♥ you Castille, ♥♥♥♥ you England and most importantly ♥♥♥♥ you Austria for declaring war on me even though I ♥♥♥♥ed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your country couple of times and still going on to the war with me with your last two remaining provinces.Still the one of the best games in the grand strategy genre and this was only my last playthrough with Mecklenburg, I thinkhave 400 hours more in this game just not on Steam. I enjoyed very good campaigns with Mecklenburg (3 times after counting this last game) Utrecht, Milan, Denmark, Bradenburg, Luxembourg and Sweden.I haven't played EU IV yet, but III is very good nonetheless.P.S. Although they seem like an underdog, Mecklenburg is ♥♥♥♥ing great to play and the easiest nation to form German Nation.P.S. France is too OP.			",231,58,10,24,37,2,59

												Highly recommended game, absolutely worth the money, got it a couple of days ago and ive been playing it nonstop! dont be detered by the somewhat crappy tutorial, the game explains itself as you play (after a few restarts ;) )  the only bad points i can come up with are that at high game speed the pop ups can occasionally become somewhat overwhelming and you end up missing stuff, but this is to easily fixed by just playing at a lower speed anyway. i was extremely impressed by the sheer amount of different available starting nations, from Scotland to The Golden Horde (and everywhere inbetween) and also by the fact that you can pick your starting date to the exact day, of the exact year that you want, anywhere inbetween 1399 and 1820, with historical events that happened at that time irl, shaping the world in game, allowing you to reshape world history however you want. in addition to that the game includes an extremely indepth system of government, which you can tweak however you want, as long as you dont mind the instabily and revolts that may follow if you try to change your policies too rapidly, or you overtake a province not used to your tyrannical, ironfisted rule. I could go on but id much rather you just scrolled up and bought the game so you can experience it for yourself. What are you waiting for? The world isnt going to rule itself....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest grand strategy games around, EU3 takes a very strong stance as you fight and earn money for your nation. There are many different ways to advance your country's score along the leaderboards, with the economy, diplomacy, and tactical wars being chief among them. The learning curve is pretty steep in the beginning, but you'll be able to manage the economy and diplomacy fairly quickly. I haven't even mastered the combat yet, as it takes a very RNG approach to it. Even with huge numbers and a decent general, it is still possible to lose to less-equipped forces.8/10. Some minor bugs and crashes aside, this was a quality title and I recommend it for anyone who wants to get into grandstrategy games.			",525,130,22,118,68,2,132

												Was a great game in its time, but occasionally a game will come out that just renders your old flame completely obsolete. Europa Universalis IV does that in a big way to EUIII, so while I am giving this the thumbs up on the basis that it was a solid game for its time, there is basically no reason to choose EUIII over EUIV.

												I am seriously addicted to this game. For me this game took strategy to a whole new level, instead of being infantry tactics and generalized warfare it turns out to be just as much strategic in the economic, political and social point of view. You need to develop your nation to achieve your goals of domination either by: Amassing a unstopabble Army, Using your political influence to get strong nations to help you, or simply buying strong nations off from the roots of trade. This game taught me that you do not need to be the most large and sprawling nation to become an global dominating empire.			",51,5,0,4,12,0,13

												Empire Total War looks nice and has real time battles but EU 3 is a far better game in terms of diplomacy, war, empire management such like. Make sure you get all the expansions as EU 3 Complete isn't complete. It misses the last couple of expansions Heir to the Throne and Divine Wind which make a big differrance to the game. This was included in EU 3 Chronicles. So remember this if you have also played the demo which didn't include these.I've barely covered what is contained in this game in terms of the hours I've played so far and the content but surfice to say this is quite comprehensive. I don't feel the need to get EU4 anytime soon. I also recomend For The Glory which is an improved version of EU2			",32,0,0,14,8,0,31

												Like wine, Europa Universalis III is a game that seems to only get better with age. Arguably one of the best games of its genre, Europe Universalis III provides the player with hours and hours that stack up to days, weeks, months and years of fun, challenge and not to forget, infuriation. With In Nominae it is possible to play any date between 1399 to 1821, with surprisingly good historical accuracy. For a game that hasn't been updated for 3 years, it's still very enjoyable for those who've been playing since its birth. With the Divine Wind DLC and the latest updates and patches, the game has graphics that are fair on the eyes, to compliment the already intricate and enjoyable gameplay. If you're new to Paradox games and want a good place to start from, EUIII is the game for you.			",2,7,0,5,4,0,8

												Although largely oudated by its successor, Europa Universalis 4, especially for those with a passion for grand strategy, Europa Universalis III remains a solid entry in the franchise. Great for those new to the grand strategy genre, ths game runs well on most machines and, with the expansions, looks great too. With over a hundred hours in ths game it remains one of my favourites of all time. Definitely worth picking up, especially if on sale as it can often be found for less than $10. Recommended overall as a classic grand strategy game.			",70,8,0,13,15,1,27

												Much better than the new EUIV. This version feels less ""gamey"" and more like a history simulator with a living, breathing world coded in. That makes the learning curve a bit steeper, but accomplishments seem all the more grand. The graphics are a bit dated, however I see this as a plus as even the cheapest of laptops can run the full experience. I cannot recommend this game highly enough!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played this for hundreds of hours without Steam and thoroughly enjoyed every minute, It's better than EU 2 and obviously not as good as 4, but you may want to buy 3 even today since it'll easily run fast on your laptop while 4 will not and, I stress this, you'll get the full collection of expansions, DLC and whatnot with 2 purchases for ~30 € while with EU 4 software piracy is still the only sane option for a completionist.Playing EU 3 will make you smarter even if you don't want it to. I can strike up a conversation about Swedish steel or Galician independence any time thanks to this feature. When I become king of Estonia I'll make this game mandatory.			",45,23,0,11,6,0,6

												The now classic 'Grand Strategy Game' Europa Universalis III, with its four obligatory expansions 'Napoleon's Ambition', 'In Nomine', 'Heir to the Throne' and 'Divine Wind', should perfectly well manage to both engage and challenge any avid intrepid strategy gamer out there.The Europa Universalis strategy series (by Paradox Development Studio) is a good supplement or alternative to Sid Meier's Civilization strategy series. Playing the two franchises 'in tandem' is feasable without getting overwhelmed by ""strategy fatigue"". The two franchises compliment eachother and opens up for enjoyable strategy gaming experiences.Unlike its successor Europa Universalis IV, Europa Universalis III is no longer in development and no further expansions or dlc (downloadable content) has been announced. In other words; the game is complete.And on that note, I can higly recommend a purchase if you find the whole idea and prospect of starting Europa Universalis IV a little bit daunting.I enjoyed Europa Universalis III to the utmost. And I still from time to time boot it up for another interesting challenge.Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first tried Europa Universalis 3, I got bored of the game within an hour. I was considering to get a refund for it, but decided to give it another go. And am I glad I did. This game for me feels like the grand strategy of the Total War seires on steriods. It requires patience, as just going on a massive warmongering spree will just end in half the nations on your continent starting a war with you and you nation being excommunicated. I still have know idea what I'm doing at times as at time of writing, I'm still waiting for Henry V to take the throne (King Henry IV just won't die!). To cut to the chase, if you don't mind the complete lack of action and are a big fan of strategy, this is a title you should keep an eye on.			",129,15,3,19,11,1,24

												The main value of this game is first unlocked with the Expansion packs Heir to the Throne, and the Divine Wind, which is what i will be giving a review of.The game's graphics are average, nothing fancy here...However, for replayability, it is almost impossible to run out of countries to play, from the Americas to Asia, and from Africa to Scandinavia. There are more than 250 countries to play as through history, from Napoleon's France, to the (I think Qing Dynasty??) In China. The map also has more than 300 provinces to capture and rule.Story-wise: You make your own story, for your chosen country, say you're Norway, can you break free from the claws of Denmark and re-establish your former glory? Or Brandenburg, who is struggling with being part of a ""Personal union"" with Luxembourg. etc.Aside from that, there's little events that pop up at random points during gameplay. This can be lots of things, from a meteor sighting (Those are nasty) to gaining a free advisor!So if you fancy gameplay over graphics, then this is probably a game for you!			",105,12,3,20,33,0,61

												As far as I'm concerned, this is the best game ever - especially in this version with the first two additions to the game.To a certain extent, it is comparable to the Total War games, if they only included the map mode, which would here be simplified to armies only being able to move from province to province and not within a province. However, you have a more complicated diplomacy and domestic policy to deal with.Another thing that makes it different, and, for my taste, better than the Total War games, is the greater realism and historical accuracy - in this game you can't just conquer everything, and it remains challenging for the more than four centuries that its timespan covers.The fact that the game never becomes ""too easy"" is what makes it so good: You know early on that you want to make the country as which you are playing as successful as possible and to that end, you have to position it so it can rise to the challenge while always remaining watchful for your rivals.Some (minor) things which might make the game a little less enjoyable are the huge random factor in battles - one of the factors that determine a battle outcome to a sometimes massive extent is the game literally casting a dice, which might be a little frustrating sometimes, especially when your and your opponent's armies are roughly equal. Precisely this is also the next minor annoyance in the game: Armies are quite often equal, aside from their exact size, as you do not have a lot of options in structuring your military - which, while rather straightforward and easy to understand, is a bit disappointing, as the game's focus, while definitely present in diplomacy, trade, colonisation and policy, is still mainly conquest.Also, and this has more to do with the store page than the game, I'm almost sure some of the screenshots are not from the version that is sold here, but from a version where one or both of the further DLCs (which are not included in the ""complete"" version) are installed.All in all, a definite buy, as long as you are into (grand) strategy games, and don't need a game to be too action-laden.EDIT: As I've now bought all the DLCs to this game, I am now rather certain that some of the screenshots on the store page aren't from this game at all, but rather from Europa Universalis IV, which would definitely be an avoidable mistake on Steam's side.

												Whee. Europa 3, like its predecessors and its cousins Hearts of Iron and Victoria (Crusader Kings as well, but that isn't as hard to learn), is an extremely complex game that is notoriously difficult to learn, not helped by crappy tutorials. I had an edge having been playing this series since its first installment, but it still took some time to get used to everything. So right from the start expect a significant time investment on learning how to play the game, and learning to do well at it. War, Diplomacy, Trade, Exploration, and more. It's all here.But it is worth it. Oh yes is it worth it. EU3 is a -gigantic- game with near-endless replayability and a player-driven storytelling ability (creating a story from your own experience of playing the game) in the same league as the Civilization and Sims games. You can play as any country in the world, though the game is a bit euro-centric considering the time period it covers (1399-1821) is the period in history when Europe came to dominate most of the rest of the world. Those who know their history also know that there is a MASSIVE amount of stuff contained in this time period: The fall of Byzantium and the rise of the Ottoman Turks, Columbus' voyage to America and the mass colonizing that followed, The Protestant Reformation and the horde of religious wars that came with it, Independence movements in the ""settler colonies"" of the Americas, and finally the French Revolution that leads to a gigantic war at the end of the game.However, little to nothing is set in stone. Byzantium might not fall. The Spanish may not be the ones to build a massive American colonial empire. The Protestant Reformation might just be a tiny local event, and the French Revolution might not even happen in France or at all. In other words, there is considerable variation, and much of that can be the result of the player's actions. Events can follow history or lead to an entirely different result. I've seen just about everything happen while playing this game from the Aztecs never being conquered, the Ottomans being extinguished early on (or built into the kind of monster empire you can see in my screenshots), Spain never being united as a single country, and so much more. And if you are a masochist of the highest order, you can try to take over the world as the Ryukyu Kingdom (Okinawa).How will things go? It is up to you to see. :)			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												My hours for this game is a good landmark to base off of how much I have enjoyed this game.While in some cases buggy at one or two points in all of my hours for this game the game itself is still very good, and deserves high praise. My main complaints to the game is its slightly bad ui otherwise the game is great.While the game has been showing age, it is still highly enjoyable, and if you don't have a good enough computer for euIV this is the game for you.

												If you're interested at all in grand strategy games, you should definitely play something from the EU series. EU3 itself is mature and full of content; I still prefer it to EU4 for single player sessions, though the new EU4 expansion, the Art of War, may just change that.			",56,5,3,4,10,1,10

												I, first, played this game because it reminded of Civ V. I have been addicted to it ever since. It is much more complex than Civ V due to the openness of the gam, which is good. The AI is much more unpredictable than Civ V, which has it's disadvantages. I, once, declared war on Connaught, an Irish province, and the province-state requested the aid of Portugal and France... which they requested the aid from their allies. Pretty soon, I was engulfed in a  war with over half of Europe.			",266,40,2,37,14,0,20

												You'll understand the grandness of this EU3 when you start out by being able to choose 1 of 250 historical nations between 1453-1789.  From that point, you can lead that country through various historical moments over 3 centuries.  Can you take the role of the Aztecs and dominate Central America and fend off the European invaders?  Or perhaps go to Japan and become Shogun.  Or unite Africa.  Or take a European nation and rule Western Europe.  All those options and more.The tutorial will give you the basics of the interface, but depending on your country, there are so many more things to learn.   If you decide to try another country in your campagin, you can even save the game and choose a different country.This is a massive grand strategy game for all war game fans.			",216,46,3,78,67,6,110

												From the day one this game has been one of my favorite games. It's hard to master, true, but once you get the hang of it, you can't get enough. Want to build a dynasty in the 16th century England? Be my guest. Want to rule South America with Russia? Go ahead. All you need is time and skill :) You can put a challenge in front of you and say: I will keep North America free from European powers - you will most likely fail, but you can sure try. And that's the beauty of this game - challenges are always there and once you start the game, you can't stop. It's detailed, it's complex, and it's definetely a game that is, in my opinion, still worth playing, despite being nearly a decade old.			",31,17,14,14,13,1,12

												Note: Get the collection bundle - ""Complete"" is missing all the DLCs which make the game better.This game is an RTS where you can advance time as quickly as you want or pause. The game spans the whole world and runs from 1399 to 1820. You can play as any nation and start at any time between those years. Play a western nation and colonize the new world or play a native American nation and try to survive. Stop the Mongol and Islamic conquests of Europe or instead play as those nations. Play as a fledgling US seeking independence or reconquer. This is my best value steam purchase if not my best one period.			",55,1,0,8,3,0,10

												Europa Universalis III is a grand strategy game and a part of one of the most renowned empire building strategy franchises of all time. EUIII gives you control over a nation of your choosing (and there is plenty material to choose from) and absolute strategic freedom to assemble your future world hegemon. This game combines a perfect balance between all areas of strategy (such as depth of war tactics, exploration, diplomacy, religion and government structure), as well as makes sure all of those stated above are realistic. Don’t expect to have an easy time defending against a Great Power with a minor. The game also introduces a lot of historical aspects into it, such as the great people of the time, geographical accuracy and random historical events, that will give you some unique experience with each new nation you play. Also, the map of the world and the amount of nations is outstanding.+ Excellent music+ Excellent historical correctness+ Unique traits for different starts and nations+ Many starting options from different historical periods+ Huge replayability potential and a lot of content for hundreds of hours+ Huge amount of strategy options to approach your empire management- The resolution is pretty terrible.- May be quite confusing in terms of gameplay compared to EUIV (more thorough explanation is below).Now, here is one important distinction I want to address – the sophistication of gameplay. And I’m not talking about difficulty, exactly, although EUIII has enough of that. If you are a kind of person who enjoys a lot of details and thought put into management of your country, dynasty and international stance, etc. – then EUIII would clearly be a preferable choice for you. However, if you prefer a smooth and dynamic gameplay, then, in my opinion, EUIV does have an advantage in that regard. Once again, I own both games and both are pieces of game art, but I just thought it was important to put this out there. Enjoy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game, with many eccentricities for diplomacy.  However, how the AI thinks diplomatically is still a black box.

Still prefer CK2, but where this kind of 4x goes, CK2, HOI 3/4 , Victoria 2, EU4 and the EU3 Chronicles version, are the best games ever in this genre. Some come close, some are lame failures but nothing matches But in the end regardless of the trash pit that can be Paradox on many levels, they certainly OWN this particular genre of 4x and have yet to be matched.

Only fix i found was to save more often and if the specific load crashes i load an earlier save and cross fingers. Love the game enough to overlook the setbacks. win10			",10,1,3,4,16,1,23

												Paradox puts out some of my favorite games.  I've played EU and EU II and find EUIII to be superior in every way.  A truly sophisticated game for the sophisticated gamer.  Action lovers, beware.  Not a lot here.  Thinkers, however, should rejoice.  The game is global and you can play virtually any country on Earth.  Extensive historical research not only incorporates real world history (I love games that also teach you about history) but allows you to diverge from the historical reality to something very different from what happened in real life but still remain very realistic in terms of the capabilities of the nation.  Hundreds if not Thousands of historical events are incorporated into this game.  If FPS's are your thing, don't get this.  If hard-core braniac strategy is your thing, this is the game for you.  I've never played in multiplayer, only against the AI (which is tough enough).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the most indepth empire building/grand strategy game i have played.  You have control over everything and LITERALLY the whole world is yours to conquer.  The only bad thing is it takes awhile to learn what you are doing, and the game is VERY unforgiving.  Mess up moving your economy sliders the wrong way and you can royally screw yourself.  But after playing the game for a good couple of hours you finally get the feel for it and that's when it gets enjoyable.  There are several ways to run your country from military badass to money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The way the game is setup there are actually several ways to win wars other than just beating the other guys armies.  For example, navies can be powerful because you can blocade a country and bankrupt them, easily winning a war without firing a single shot which is really interesting.  (I also like any game where navies are important :D)  Basically a fun empire building game but it takes sometime and effort to learn.			",193,30,0,41,24,0,52

Do you want to conquer world? Dominate the Holy Roman Empire? Spread Orthodox beliefs? Restore the almighty Byzantine Empire starting with 2 provinces against mighty Turk? (My favorite :)) Or just form a super-rich Trade league? Or conquer Europe as Japan?All of this in one game spanning centuries in past. Playing from 1399-1820 takes about 30 hours.

												If you can master this game... or come remotely close to mastering this game, then you should be deemed King of Strategy games.A multifaceted strategy game that will keep you busy pulling out your hair for hours; the complexity of this game is both a strength and a source of limitless frustrations. :) With that said, it is well worth the $15 that is now being charged for it.Works seemlessly on Windows. Perhaps one day I will get around to installing it on my Linux box.			",11,3,0,9,7,0,7

												It's like one of the Total War games, except that it's developed by Paradox so the learning curve is just about vertical and the graphics suck. Still, it's a game developed by Paradox, so regardless of these shortcomings it has that magic addictive SOMETHING that makes you come back to it and sink hour after hour into it.  Call it fun, I guess? Doubly so if you like history.If you're going to buy this, get the Divine Wind expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Paradox have a fantastic collection of history based Grand Strategy Games. Think 'RISK' with a little bit of politics, and that's what you're going to get from Europa Universalis III. Those going in expecting amazing graphics and detailed animated battles will be disappointed, as it's simply not _that_ game. Fights are math/dice roll based, which take into account unit type, general, terrain, etc so there is depth in the battles. However, visually they are represented by single unit graphic, numbers, and literally dice rolls. I don't mind this, as it suits the desk top game nature that I've come to admire from the Paradox Clausewitz Engine. Once you overcome this the games become incredibly indepth, with various scenerios based on history appearing throughout the game. You can either follow them as we know them, or change the course of history.To give you an idea of the scale the game can potentially last over the course of 400 years (if you have all the expansions) from 1399-1821. So you can start at the end of the 'Hundred Year War' and finish around the time of 'Napoleon' with all the history in between.The latest DLC 'Divine Wind' adds the Far East to EUIII (Japan & China). I haven't had a chance to fully test out this area of the game yet, but it sounds detailed and exciting. If you enjoy Empire Building (and a slight Dynasty building element), and don't mind a lack of detailed animations to keep your attention span, then this game might be for you.

												EU3 is a strategy game and historical simulation.  You can take on the leadership of any nation or province you choose, and your decisions decide the course of history.  It's a complex game, there is a lot to do and a lot to learn, and the game doesn't explain itself well.  The tutorial is broken, and can't be relied on, so you can expect a lot of confusion at first.  Once you understand the basics, the scope is incredible.			",175,41,6,32,22,4,50

												Probably the cleverest concept I've come across in any computer game bar Hearts Of Iron 3. The research that went into this game is unbelievable. I've learnt more about history from this game than any game I've ever played. Tough learning curve but the effort learning it is rewarded with hours of thoughtful, strategic and addictive gameplay. The complexity adds to the experience rather than detracts and doesn't stop it from being fun and compelling. In fact, the complexity helps make it so compelling.			",78,26,19,19,16,3,63

												I honestly can\'t reccomend this game (and all it\'s DLC, which are MANDATORY) if you can get EU4 *AND* and it\'s DLC. But, There is some fun to be had here still. The biggest difference between this game and it\'s sequel is that you can quite easily play this game like \""Risk\"" and just put your country in a near-continous state of war. Is that a good historical simulation ? No, not really, but it can be quite fun to conquer the world as some minor regional country. Also, there are some mechanical differences, which really aren\'t important unless you\'re playing the game in Multiplayer. I will say, it\'s extremely hard to ever make a non-Western country defensible against a Western one. Even the Ottomons will regularly get taken apart by the 1700s due to the way military techonlogy progresses in this one. The sequel is better, but it\'s expensive.

One thing about them though, is that seeing as there is no plot in them, it's completely pointless to purchase this game, while newer titles have come out, that essentially just expand on what was good about this game. Europa Universalis IV is the game to get, or Crusader Kings II. That said, this game is really excellent. A true time consumer, that takes diplomacy and strategy to a level most people cannot follow. You cannot win this game, and being successful in it, is a true challenge. If you have a day-time job, and you want to make an attempt at world domination in this game, you might be looking at a few years of playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An odd sort of RTS, this take place on the world stage, which combines the grand scale usually attributed to Turn based strategy while still keeping the pace of a good real time strategy, it does however have an annoying learning curve which means you will lose your first few games and the tutorials arent much help, but once you get past that it is an incredibly fun game, the best thing to do however is to not give up with this game, the political and military stage is changing constantly, in most RTS I play its easy to see when you have lost, yet this game is different, you could easily lose half of your territory and then claim it all back. The time span is good (1399 to 1821) giving a lot of time for experimentation and fun as well as Change. Each faction has a number of ways to change it, depending on your tastes, this is done through a number of policy sliders as well as national and religious policies, these could be anything from adding a liqour tax to the union of an entire country (there are many of these such as forming Britain, Germany, Italy and Russia), which can make the game incredibly fun, over all I would give this a 9 out of 10, the only problem being the learning curve and subpar Tutorial			",88,9,0,18,22,2,44

												Europa Universalis III is not realistic, it is almost real. All the details that you dive in drives the game into a significantly different direction. I also had the chance to play EU2 and I can easily say that the game has been drastically improved. To all fans!			",15,0,0,2,9,0,22

They won't even discount it under 50% because EU IV players have realised that this is actually better game than the one thay are trying to play.			",261,46,7,65,27,0,69

												The peak of the classic Europa Universalis Formula, now with the 3D graphics that produced YEARS of salt in people like me. Europa Universalis was fun, Europa Universalis II was great and this one takes Europa Universalis II's features and adds even more depth to them. This game might not be for someone used to EUIV, but it's worth it. Even moreso i you liked EU2/FTG and are willing to give PDX's 3D a chance. I'm still a loyalist to the hand-drawn maps and PSX-style rendered soldiers of EU2 but I won't deny it's a great game.			",21,9,0,13,7,0,28

If however, you want to be lurched over, pulling your hair out about the fact that everyone in your kingdom hates you, france hates you, spain hates you, scotland and ireland hate you but the Dutch for some reason love you, then this is the game for you.I've already figured out that it's going to take me atleast another 6-8 hours of game time to figure out what I'm actually doing and once I've done that I know that this will be an exeptional game and take up many hours of my life.

												Firstly let me say, if you don't like strategy games and you don't feel like spending a bit of time feeling like a lost puppy whilst attempting to learn one, this game is NOT for you.  Go play Pac Man or Streetfighter or some other button masher, because this game will just hurt your wittle feelings.   It's old.  The graphics are mediocre at best and god help whatever tonedeaf goober composed the soundtrack.  None of which takes one iota of shine off the proverbial apple that is this game.  Simply put it is a masterpiece of strategic gaming.  To date this is Paradox's definitive opus.  It somehow manages to maintain beguiling simplicity side-by-side with byzantine depth.     When you first start playing around with it you will probably fumble around like a weetodd on a trampoline(no offence to all you 'todds out there), but you'll STILL be able to make satisfying headway.  And once you have a firm grasp of the mechanics you'll be orchestrating Machiavellian plots that will bring massive swathes of the world under your evil (let's just face it you warmongering bastage) grasp.  If you can master the mechanics of this baby you're well on your way to being a fully qualified field marshall of strategic gaming.  I highly recommend this game to anyone just getting into Paradox's line of strategy games.  It's a far more refined product than it's successor game EU 4 is at this point.10 out of 10 and you can take that to the bank.			",230,37,0,65,50,0,51

												If you are into a game where you can manage a country or you want a nice game to kick off your addiction to Paradox games, this is the game for you, yes it is a rather old game and I hear you say ""...Why not get the newer version"" well my young apprentices I believe that the newer EU & most newer paradox games are more complex (of sorts) and this is an excellent game in order to get use to these types of games, the idea is simple yet effective and I enjoyed this game 110%. The music is great but to be honest I normally play with the music off but it was still lovely to listen to when I first heard it, the game runs perfectly on my desktop and I also tested it on my old rubbish laptop which has been in a cupboard since 2008 and it runs perfect on that too so if you have an old desktop/laptop this game is fine. As far as a story goes the story is... well you make the story, you pave your countries future although main timeline events do happen and you cannot change that you can effect the events.Graphics - Good (for the style of game & age)Gameplay - Does the job perfectly.Story - The story is whatever you make it.Music - Lovely.Mechanics - Does the job perfectly.Overall - I'd give this game a solid 7/10 edging to an 8.

												The monolithic historical simulator from Paradox gets a makeover with lessons learned from Victoria, Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron. The most noticeable improvement from EU2 is the 3D graphics and polished interface. The graphics don’t do as much for the look of the game as much as it simplifies the look of the map. Gone is that “boardgame” feel of EU2 as land, cities and armies have more of an organic feel to them rather then just being markers.A great new improvement is national ideas. By specializing your country in certain aspects of warfare, trade, exploration and colonization or religion, you can get your goals accomplished easier. What is interesting is you will see some nations choose some very ahistorical ideas. In other words, imagine Poland recruiting conquistadors to colonize Central America. (Would they even be called “conquistadors?”)The AI in EU3 is considerably harder and smarter. If you post an army at a neighbor’s border, don’t be surprised if he does the same. Beyond warfare, allies will betray you, rivals will rush to colonize the best provinces, and nations will band together to stop your expansion.Overall, EU3 just plays differently than its predecessor. Random events aren’t as “random” as before and every choice you make effects the decisions you will make in the future. This makes the game play along more natural storylines.The retail version comes with a beautiful 145 page manual that describes pretty much all you need to know to play a game. The tutorials will help you navigate the interface but the majority of learning comes from playing the game itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you know of the great Swahili Empire?  Starting in 1399, The Swahili Sunnis rapidly expanded along western Africa, by 1430 they had taken Ethopia, Mutapa, and Adan along with smaller provinces.  They bid their time, eyeing to make the Hajj to Kabba in Mecca, but under a different set of circumstances.  They struck in the early 1500s, after a series of insults and casus belli was declared.  The Swahili Empire soon spread to the far reaches of Morrocco and Algiers to standing at Byzantines Walls and along the Caspian Sea.  Rather than foolhardedly attacking Europe and risking another crusade, The Swahili's played a defensive war along the European front, instead focusing on the east.  Soon the Swahili's, after many years of consolidating the Muslim world, the conquest of India and South East Asia in the 1600s, turned their eyes to Europe.  They broke through Southern Russia in an attempt to avoid upsetting the Catholics hoping they wouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the Orthodox heathens, Alas! Most of Europe declared war upon the Swahilis,  After a series of mishaps and severe losses on the battlefield. The Swahili was swept back to present day Turkey by about 1660s.  India at this point also had several intense rebellions, and along with a huge blow to prestige the Swahili Empire crumbled and peasent rebellions littered the middle east.  By the time the Swahili Empire had subdued and put to rest the rebellions.  It stood at about 1850s Ad.  By this time France Had been on the warpath in Europe.  England, Italy and Spain lay as their vassals, and Austria, Poland, Russia were breathing their last breath.  By the time the Swahili Empire had started to move their troops to Granada and Turkey France moved like a tank powered by a jet engine.  First Granada, then Morrocco and Turkey.  France then cut a swath south torward Yemen cutting the Swahili Empire in two.  The Indians rebelled and soon were occupied by France.  By 1950 the Swahili Empire was  no more, and France lay as Supreme empire occupying most of the three continents.Tl;DrNever Invade Russia in winter...or ever.♥♥♥♥ France....just ♥♥♥♥ it.10/10			",381,90,8,58,60,8,92

												*This review is about EUIII Collection(Including DW)EUIII was my first Grand Strategy game(not steam version though), and the gateway drug that introduced me to other Paradox drugs. It lacks lots of clean intefaces of EUIV, however possesses great potential of becoming a more addictive drug with mods. In addition, the map graphic of EUIII makes player to feel the real atmosphere of medieval-early modern period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When you play a game you want to get further into the game.Every game made by Paradox (including this one) Makes me feel that I am building an empireThe game is hard for example if you expand to fast everyone will hate you and therewill be revolts everywhereIf you expand slowly some other nation will pwon you.Also the game is not for people who are not patient because in two hours you can build a small empire and still not be #1The game requires skill and once you play your cards right everything will go in your favor. The game is complex as in I can talk to you for hours on the best way to play the game. You make your own plot and one of the best features in the game is yo can play as ANY nation between 1399 and 1821 while changing nations DURING save files. Once you get past the learning curve you will have a great time playing this. (I know this game is old but I am bored so I wrote this :3) Sorry for any spelling errors I moght make			",60,3,0,5,9,0,18

												Kannte lange nur das alte ""Knights of Honor"" und fragte mich oft, warum kein Entwickler ein neues Spiel dieser Art auf den Markt bringt. Da entdeckte ich die Europa Universalis Reihe. Absolut bahnbrechend, sehr gut durchdacht und für jeden Hobby-Historiker eine Freude. Denn viele historische Begebenheiten (zwischen 1500-1820) wurden eingebaut. Man braucht zwar einige Stunden um sich ins das Spiel rein zu fuchsen, aber es lohnt sich. Mittlerweile ist der vierte Teil veröffentlicht. Den muss ich mir noch holen. Dieses Game erhält von mir die Bestnote.			",13,0,0,0,9,0,4

												If you prefer a game that involves alot of in-depth thinking, planning and are willing to have paitience, I'd suggest picking this up, its a good buy for large scale strategy, empire building and re-writing history as you see fit, its difficult to start but once you figure everything out its highly enjoyable			",242,57,4,68,94,4,87

												Game is slow and tedious. The A.I. can be totally crushed in a region and wont surrender or conced defeat. Its stupid. Why do I have to invade Spain to claim victory? Isnt conquering the entire New World from them a victory that I can take to the negotion table? Nope it wasnt. They refused any peace treaty. This was a game I started after the American Revolution and therefore had no history or anything of that sort. I find it amazing I can conquer two continents and they wont even accept a peace treaty where I give everything back. This game sucks. Its old now too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this games approach to economic development and diplomacy over the main focus being war, exept for the fact that no matter how good your relations are with one country they constantly insult you till you have below a 100 friendlyness rating then attack you and the cherry on top is they take all your money and provinces exept your capital ! Unlike total war were you could be a weaker faction ,but rise up, this game screws you over at every corner as a small empire, Expecialy when later on the country no longer exists.

												Map Painting Simulator. If you love map painting, then this game is for you - all the politics in Europa Universalis III is about one ultimate goal: Annihilate everyone until you are the only one left or you get bored and start all over, preferably as a different country. Some countries are better represented, other are just there to exist and perish, but overall there are enough interesting states to provide a huge amount of gameplay, especially with all the add-ons. Unfortunately, for me this game is a rather bland experience. I would vote ""average"" if it was possible on Steam, however, it is not. This is the worst series that comes from Paradox studio, because it doesn't provide any internal politics like Crusader Kings, nor any interesting economics and population control like Victoria. The wars are not as detailed and do not require much thinking either, this isn't anything like Hearts of Iron, where the player is challenged and has to adapt to the changing war and apply appropriate tactics. Europa Universalis III is just about attacking smaller country and overrunning it quickly with army, taking it over and repeating the same thing all the time. It has other elements of gameplay, but nothing of importance. Unlike other Paradox games EU III doesn't focus on any particular aspect of running a country, hence it is quite void of content and feels bland. I would recommend playing Victoria II, Crusader Kings 2 or Hearts of Iron III over Europa Universalis III, depending on what exactly are you looking in such a game, because EU III has nothing special about it.

												Being from 2007, this game looks TERRIBLE. There are crashing issues as well.Also, this game is not great. Lots of clicking to get simple things done or to get information that should be readily apparent.Recruiting units is a pain: Click province, click unit button, click unit. Click next province, click unit button, click unit. Click next province, click unit button, click unit... on and on ad nauseum. You have to click on individual armies and open up a dialogue to see how large they are. There is no indication for this on the campaign map. Good luck keeping everything straight. Oh, and good luck selecting a fleet, instead of the port it's next to; or not pulling your hair out trying to get just the ships you want out of a group of fleets (group select, and then individually close each individual fleet you don't want... instead of being able to simply select the one you do want).Oh, and nations are not labelled on the political mapmode... what's with that? They're color coded, but if you want to see who that is, you have to click on one of their provinces and hope you didn't actually select one of their neighbors who's a slightly different shade of yellow. Again, good luck keeping anything straight. Trade and diplomacy are similarly inscrutable. They have mapmodes, but centers of trade are not labelled, and there's no visual indication of how trade flows from one place to another; unless you open individial trade center menus and learn to read them. Not for the faint of heart or the casual player. Basically... skip this one. The only reason I played it at all is that EUIV has trouble running on my machine and I can't afford an upgrade just yet. But even if this were the newest outing... there are a lot of gaps where any game dev who was giving it serious thought might easily have tripped over a better solution than what they have implemented.

This epic strategy game lets players take control of a nation and guide it through the ages to become a great global empire. Unparalleled in its depth and historical accuracy, Europa Universalis III gives the player unprecedented freedom in how they choose to rule their nation from an impressive choice of over 250 historically accurate countries.

												Seen from a distance - with no playing experience - this game seems interesting. ""A grand scale strategy game"" and all that. In the end, though, the whole deal turns into numbers going by and the player hoping for something to happen. Status Quo is maintained as far as possible. I'll rather read a history book. It would have helped to design this the same way the Total War games have been designed: turn based strategy, real time battles - or even the same way Civilization has been designed (I'll have to give EU III this: the game mechanics aren't as corny as in Civ... but EU still manages to be less interesting). In EU III you can drop a merchant, a spy, or an army somewhere and wait. That's all the action you will get. The game might be good otherwise but really, the player doesn't have a whole lot to do in it. Sometimes something happens but it's way too minor to keep me interested for long. If you're a natural born bookkeeper you will love this game.It has to be mentioned that I read books and play chess, too. It's not gore that I'm missing: I don't like shoot-them-ups for several reasons. Also, I'm not a kid any more, so my attention span is pretty long. Not long enough for EU III, though.

												Updated one year later: Broken as all hell, UI looks like it was designed in 1999 I'd love the play this game as I'm a big strategy game fan, played the crap out of Civilization 4, but in it's current state the game is more frustrating than fun. The 'tutorials' in this game are a complete joke, never have I ever seen a less useful game tutorial. All it does is♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with it's narrow view approach to the game. They don't explain how jack works, they just say here is the here and there is the there. Oh, you wanted to actually know what the here does? HHAHAHAHA ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!! FIGURE IT  OUT YO ♥♥♥♥ING SELF YOU ♥♥♥♥ING MORON HAHAHAH YOU THOUGHT A TUTORIAL WAS ACTUALLY SUSPOSED TO TEACH? AHAHAHAHHA LULZZZLZLZ  TROLLLLEEDDDDDD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!!!Oh, what's that? want to learn how combat in the game works? HAHAHAHHA ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!! We will tell you to move units to x province and when they get there..... NOTHING, ♥♥♥♥ING NOTHING1!!!! AREN'T WE JUST THE ♥♥♥♥ING FUNNIEST DUDES TO EVER DESIGN A GAME? ♥♥♥♥ bug testing, we are much too busy pulling DLC out of our own arses just to keep you checking the store every month just to make sure your edition is still the 'complete' edition. LULZZZZ TROLLED YA ♥♥♥♥♥ HAHAHAHA.Getting back to the UI though. Looks like it was designed in 1999 for 800x600 displays. I mean there is NO UI scaling when playing at 1080p so get used to squinting at your monitor or invest in one of those mountable magnifying glasses they sell for reading books. Or you could just give up and play at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low resolution like Paradox wants you to do. Oh and the defualt refresh rate is 25Hz because..... reasons. The UI is just damn outdated for a game that came out in 2007, I mean come on. Original review:Buying the DLC does not fix the any of the aforementioned problems, I have the complete edition and the game still glitches when playing the tutorials. I was told to move my man at arms to a neighboring county in one tutorial. I've done so repeatedly and it never registers with the game. I also have to disable one of my monitors (I have a duel setup) just to launch the game, at it's default settings the game runs at 30 fps which for some reason for me makes the screen flicker much like a CRT monitor, I had to bump it up to 60fps for smooth play.That's not all, the font at 1920x1080 is all but unreadable. I pretty much have to press my nose to the screen just to decipher the terribly small font they used. I've tried lowering the resolution only to have my monitor go out of range forcing me to hard boot my PC thereby loosing a topic I was writing about in my browser.All of the first tutorials require restarts after successfully completing one or the game will crash upon attempting the second. Load times are a joke for such a small install game and the time it take initially to precache everything is close to 5 minutes, and this is with me rocking a SSD.Of the little over 60 minutes I've invested in this game at least half of it has been waiting screens and the other half chasing down glitches in the game play. 0/10 Unplayable mess.P.S. before you inevitably down vote me for expressing my dissatisfied experience as a paying customer please let me know exactly how my analysis is incorrect and what I'm doing wrong. I'd love the play this game as I'm a big strategy game fan but in it's current state the game is more frustrating than fun.			",325,126,8,61,53,4,114

												Uhh, first off, I got this game on Humble Bundle, so I really didn't know what I was getting into. I gotta say though, the game looked promising. Once I opened it, the interface for a game was very clumsy. It was hard to select a unit, and hard to do other basic things that should be easy to learn. I found nothing interesting or intriguing about the game, so after watching a few tutorials, and playing for 2 hours, I gave up. Maybe I am missing something, but this game is lacking in many areas such as UI, gameplay, and controls. Maybe I was spoiled by the simplicty of Civ:5, but I would not reccomend this game to beginners of this genre.			",105,11,3,5,4,0,7

												Europa Universalis III was promising from its advertising, but the game itself is a broken mess of disappointment.  I was looking forward to the level of depth and intricacy the game promises, but I was wholly disappointed in the actual product.  The detail is pointless with a broken, unintuitive UI and Paradox fails to maintain a level of product quality.  Animations and images would randomly not display and the gameplay was stilted at best.  Save your money for a future version that hopefully fixes all the issues.			",130,13,2,8,10,2,39

This is not like Civilization, if you take a crappy country it will be a lot harder.  It has a steeper learning curve but the open nature of the goals and the historical context make it well worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is one of these games that take you a while to figure out and then grap you to that ""one more turn"" feel during hours.I have played plenty of it outside Steam and asure with hundreads of hours that if you like either Risk, Crusader Kings, Victoria, Civilization or other slow paced grand strategy titles you will problably apreciate playing this game over and over.PS: mods are amazingly easy to do, easy to use, and adds to replability, sooooooo, look for it at Google, it has some for every taste.

												In my opinion, this is the best grand strategy title that Paradox has made.  If you are a patient leader, you will quickly spend hours dominating the world from any starting point for a campaign that spans nearly half a millenium.  Grab a drink, pop on some music, and get to ruling.			",82,30,1,19,15,2,25

												One of the most complex, enormous, and entertaining strategy games I've played. Play as any state at any time between 1399 and 1821. Although Crusader Kings II provides more heart and story options, the direction you take your country in this game always feels meaningful and the results of your choices are satisfyingly realistc. This game is sadly dated in interface and graphics, but some of the most memorable experiences I've had in gaming come from this title ... and its gameplay feels a little less gamey than the newer, less patched and befitted with expansions sequel.

												A unique game, EU3 is history come to life.  You play as one of hundreds of states, from tiny city states to massive empires, as you navigate your way through the centuries from the end of the middle ages to the dawn of the 19th century.  The game can be frustrating to new players, but well worth exploring - especially the many free mods which change gameplay experience dramatically.			",66,68,1,66,37,2,41

												Labelled as a grand strategy and rightfully so, Europa Universalis is epic in its scale. The game takes place between 1399 and 1820 and takes a lengthy amount of time to finish. Steer your chosen country to the spoils of conquest, trade, colonisation or diplomacy. EU3 maybe be considered a hardcore game, but while it's depth may seem initally daunting, is a deep contributor to its long lasting success and dedicated fanbase. If you need help to learn the game I'll be happy to help, I fell asleep on my first play through, but I stuck to it and consider this game as one of the most underated of all time. Civ players may wish to avoid and stick to their soft, pastoral, relaxing TBS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the Best Paradox games published. Its great to start out with a few cheat codes to get into the game and learn all the curves and edges of the game but just so you can get to play it without them of course ;). Since its better to have the real challenge with the normal game instead of just get everything you want with the cheats but i found myself better into it with them to be honest :/. All in all you can have fun as a new ruler or as an advanced player. The game offers all the opportunitys you need and want to get YOUR game rolling. Especially the Complete bundle backs this up. If you want to form the world in the shape you want this game is the right one since it offers the most time and the most diversity so i recommend it highly			",37,6,0,15,8,0,15

												Every time I have played this game with someone else, they've shown me a rule or menu I've never seen before and often, I'll show them the same. This is after over 200 hours of play. It is a complex game that challenges the player to explore the mechanics and bend them to their own purposes while remaining playable at different levels of experience. I've spend several hours at a time just watching the in game time pass and the other countries gain and lose ground. The amount of joy that can be found in doing this and in checking older saves to see how Europe has changed over time has led me to affectionately refer to Europa Universallis III as Map: The Game.

												If you're not looking for a biased opinion on this game; Don't look here. I absolutely ADORE this game. I honestly can't get enough of it. Though it has a massive learning curve after you get the basics of economy, stability, and diplomacy you'll find that this is one of the best of it's kind.Set in a time period between 1399 and 1821 you begin the game as one of the nations that once (or still does) own any ammount of land throughout the world. From there you manage relations, economy, military, technology, and many other things as you attempt to create a large and glorious nation for your people. Build alliances with your neighbors or lay seige to their lands but beware the Golden Horde of Eastern Europe, or the mighty power of Ming for they have a vast empire and are not to be trifled with. So, mighty King what have you to say for your nation? Are you the mighty who strike with an iron fist, or those who would like to buy out the world? Can you lead your people to greatness, or will you lead them to an early grave? Gameplay wise the game is fairly simple. Through many menus you'll be able to manage your money, how much you invest in your military and technology, and what policies your nation will take. As for the battles in the game it's all based on the terrain your armies fight in, if you've given your army a general and what general is more effective, and army composition. (Note: You do NOT control what happens in the battle. You just tell your army to attack the other and the game generates an outcome.) Overall this is a really great game, and I'd recommend it to anyone particularly those into grand strategies such as this. I'd recommend playing as England (Just take Scotland and Ireland then use your Navy for defence),or France (HUGE military power in this game. Only reason these fellows don't command the world is due to the large nation of Spain to the southwest, England being a island with a large navy, and the Holy Roman Empires sheer numbers.) 9/10.

												Great Game. Really historical and strategical. The wasteland is kind of restrictive in terms of colonization and the tutorials flat out don't work, but besides that it is a very addicting stratagy game. Only recomended for the pure stratagy lovers (if you think Risk is a long game, I would not recomend this). One of the most historically best maps you will find. This is the most historically acurate game and includes as much history as it can, while still making it fun. Civilization V has just civilizations, and not nearly as many (but each one is unique), with no acurate map included with the game. Total War has an accurate map and great combat systems, but not nearly as many nations and is restricted chronologically. The Europa Universalis is truly the most historical stratagy game series you will find.*Note, this review is for EU3 with Divine Wind			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defiently one of my favorite games of all time. If you are a fan of history, this is a must. Taking a one province and forging it into an empire is truely satisfiyng as well as ahistorical outcomes such as the one game I played and made a Scottish Canadian Empire and continuously fought the English from a tyranical rule of the British Isles. Or the one game where I reclaimed Isreal from the Ottoman Empire as the Knights of Rhodes. With a little imagination, some luck the possibilities are endless. Defiently not a waste of time despite many hours poured into countless countries and campaigns. Only bad thing is a steep learning curve in the beginning that might disaude people form playing. After a game or two however you immerse yourself in the many aspeects of EU3, you will never regret it! Especially at the price it is right now so cheap for endless hours of entertainment.

												If you are a strategy fan, it is hard to go wrong with this game.  Countries of different sizes, locations, tech groups, religions all make for lots of replayability.  It's a long game, and can eat away hours at a time in a single play session.  The Complete includes all the expansion packs which added new mechanics and modified the vanilla game.Perhaps my favorite thing about the game is there is always something to do.  Long term goals may be to become the biggest superpower, best trader, largest colonial empire, or perhaps take over the world (muhahaha), but each play session you have shorter term goals to get there, from increasing your tech to balancing your economy, to forging alliances, to converting the heretics within your nation.  A lot of fun, and one of the best values for my gaming dollars.			",30,17,0,30,1,0,6

												Great Game. Really historical and strategical. The wasteland is kind of restrictive in terms of colonization and the tutorials flat out don't work, but besides that it is a very addicting stratagy game. Only recomended for the pure stratagy lovers (if you think Risk is a long game, I would not recomend this). One of the most historically best maps you will find. This is the most historically acurate game and includes as much history as it can, while still making it fun. Civilization V has just civilizations, and not nearly as many (but each one is unique), with no acurate map included with the game. Total War has an accurate map and great combat systems, but not nearly as many nations and is restricted chronologically. The Europa Universalis is truly the most historical stratagy game series you will find.*Note, this review is for EU3 with Divine Wind			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really amazing game.For those who don't know, it's a Grand Strategy. It's like Total War, but on a much larger scale, enveloping the entire world. You can play any nation from any corner of the Earth from 1399 to 1821 (with all expansions) and play it in your own way. The entire game (aside from the events) is completely unscripted and plays differently every time. Majority of the time you see England conquering Scotland, but then one game you see Scotland annexing the entire British Isles and invading Europe. History will never be the same each game. The expansions add so many more gameplay mechanics, simplify some things and make some complex, it's really adviseable to get them - they're what expansions should be, it's not some silly DLC.However, this game is really hard to get into for a beginner to Paradox's grand strategy games. It takes a long while to get used to the mechanics and settings of the game, but I believe that it's worth the effort.Try it if you're a fan of the Total War series or Paradox's other games, it's a gem. Expansions are highly recommended, as they add a -lot- of value to the game.However, now that EU IV is released, you might want to consider getting that, since It has similar features and easier to approach for a beginner.

												Anybody who likes grand strategy games should enjoy Europa Universalis 3.It offers a convincing historical setting where you can play as one of the great nations of that time (or as one of the minnows), and try to alter history as you see fit. There are no set goals, you can decide freely about what you consider to be a succesfull campaign. The game does suggest you choose from a subset of nations that were worked out in detail, but the game feels so well made that it isn't impossible to play as another nation.The AI of a strategy game is always extremely important. This game doesn't handicap the player or boost the AIs economy to be challenging, which is always a good sign. It does suffer from predictability in the diplomatic department, and sometimes decisions that don't make strategic sense can only be explained through game statistics (example: ""Ah, I see, they hate me and they can't see my armies so they attack me even though it's not in their best interests."" or ""Their war weariness is quite high so even though I entered the war on their side they still accept a disadvantageous peace almost immediately.""), but on the whole it is very satisfying to ally with or fight against.Where this game shines most is in the multiplayer department. This truly is the new Risk as far as I'm concerned, but better, much better. Convince your playgroup to play this for a few hours each week and you won't be disappointed.Some might be bothered by the fact that there is no real goal and thus no real winner, but I actually adore that aspect, it is a matter of taste. Some might be bothered by the lack of tactics (battles are fought mostly by statistics and dice rolls), but the strategic depth is such that I firmly believe that was a wise decision from the developers. And some will be bothered by the lack of flashy graphics. The look is purely functional, and the interface with all the menus and buttons already felt archaïc the moment this game was released. Anyway, for those people there is the Total War series (which I love as well), but those are the only real advantages that franchise has over this one.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big fan of paradox grand strategy titles. Sadly I upstarted with EU4 before this one. But after playing a lot of EU4/CK2/VIC2 I wanted to try out the earlier games. Well I might say the graphics can't be compared but the gameplay is similiar and kinda harder on the older titles. Lots of mechanics got simplified and expanded on the latter titles. For those that don't want to spend all the money on EU4 and it's DLCs this one is a safe bet and really cheap on sales for you to start on paradox grand titles.I really recommend it and might say it's a very safe purchase even if you own the others/latter games.

												If you're ready to be steeped in war, intrigue, and a slew of royal marriages this is the game for you. My only criticism is the learning curve. The sheer depth of gameplay makes it very steep. If you've been playing Europa Universalis then that's not an issue. Otherwise, get ready to devote a few hours to learning mechanics. After that, though, get ready for rewarding strategic gameplay unparallelled by any other game on the market. Play politics, trade, and expand your empire, with religious upheval, rebellion, rival nations and the Vatican all breathing down your neck.Unique and wonderful game that will ask you to devote tens of hours to your empire just to make a small mark on the world of Europa Universalis.

												The best of the Europa Universalis games in my opinion. EUIV focuses too much on making money by releasing ridiculously small DLC and upsetting game balances.You're in charge of a country, whether this is a historical country or a custom one, and you have to set yourself a goal. World domination will take you weeks, months, or even years to complete depending on how well you dig in and plan your battles ahead of time. Try going for something a little bit less ambitious; like wiping a neighbouring nation off the face of the planet, or being the first to circumnavigate the globe.Balancing everything in your nation from political to economic to simply trying to figure out why that one pesky province keeps rioting against your (fair) rule is a full-time task, and while you may be forgiven for setting the clock speed to very fast to see that one project to completion, your neighbours may use that precise moment to invade your nation.While EUIV adds some extra bits and bobs, EUIII is challenging enough in its own right to keep you busy for a long time.

												Very complex, and steep learning curve, but a blast once you have the hang of it and endless fun for history nerds like myself. A game which starts in 1399 will usually look completely different from how it historically did in 1820. Even better, there are third party converters available to continue your finished game in Victoria or Victoria 2For your first game, it's recommended to play France. The tutorial only scratches the surface and there will be a lot of trial-and-error and learning from your mistakes, but a powerful nation like France gives more room for error without having to quit.Incredible alternate history possibilities spanning over 400 years of history. Did I mention that you don't have to start at 1399? You can pick the specific date you want to start, which accurately recreates the world in that time. Plus the ability to play as any nation, tribe, or state in the world, and you have a timesink of an epic scale. Buy it and take the time to learn it. It's worth it!			",456,80,12,42,72,8,102

												This is one of the most complex and well-designed games I've played. It has a steep learning curve but once you've seen the amount of variety on offer you'll be impressed - there are a lot of differences in playstyle between a European colonial empire, a member of the Holy Roman Empire, the remnants of Rome, African tribals and Native Americans, to name a few. Yet each one has sets of well-thought-out rules to make it unique and challenging to master. Time-consuming game though, and requires patience, it's definitely not for the casual gamer.

Well I might say the graphics can't be compared but the gameplay is similiar and kinda harder on the older titles. Lots of mechanics got simplified and expanded on the latter titles. For those that don't want to spend all the money on EU4 and it's DLCs this one is a safe bet and really cheap on sales for you to start on paradox grand titles.I really recommend it and might say it's a very safe purchase even if you own the others/latter games.

												If you're ready to be steeped in war, intrigue, and a slew of royal marriages this is the game for you. My only criticism is the learning curve. The sheer depth of gameplay makes it very steep. If you've been playing Europa Universalis then that's not an issue. Otherwise, get ready to devote a few hours to learning mechanics. After that, though, get ready for rewarding strategic gameplay unparallelled by any other game on the market. Play politics, trade, and expand your empire, with religious upheval, rebellion, rival nations and the Vatican all breathing down your neck.Unique and wonderful game that will ask you to devote tens of hours to your empire just to make a small mark on the world of Europa Universalis.

												First off: I have played this game waaay too much. This steam version does include the time I spent playing a bootleg version with a friend of mine in high school. This game was great: I was Berry and he was Austria. By eating France, I became the most dominant power, and though my army was twice as large as his, he got me everytime we went to war through the use of spies. Spies always getting up in my business, rebellions bringing my homeland down to its knees, making a 150+ province berry crumble into a one province theocracy. Good news: His country collapsed similarly, and Europe was liberated from our opressive regime....for about 100 years. Oh, then the cannon balls flew. 10/10.			",17,2,0,8,2,0,6

												After two hours I stopped trying to figure out the game and watched a bunch of videos of people playing it on YouTube. I still don't know how to do a lot of things but I feel like I have a better idea, I've managed to complete several missions, bring my stability up, rebuild my economy, etc. I do find that even on high speed there's a lot of just watching, though maybe it's different if you pursue war more actively.The main problem though is that it tends to crash on me a lot. It does autosave at the start of each year, but it's frustrating, especially since I haven't noticed any particular cause except during the tutorial. (If I did one lesson it was fine. As soon as I went to click a second one, crash. I had to load it several times to get thorugh the whole tutorial.)I did get it on sale, so I'm not out much money, and I will keep playing it, but it's not as satisfying as it could be. Advice for other people? I don't know. A lot of players don't seem to have any problem with crashing, so it might be something to do with how it interacts with my specific system. (Almost new Mac, newest OS.) I'd say wait for a sale if you do get it.			",2,5,0,3,2,0,2

												My friend had this game for a long time, and had always been put off by the poor graphical display offered to me by Steam and You Tube videos. But. And I mean But. This game man! Since buying it I have not been able to kick the addiction. I'm a big RTS guy I’ve played all the Total Wars, AoE blah blah blah. But not much comes close to the world sculpting that can be had in EU III. So let’s get the Negatives out the way... I have mentioned already that the graphics aren’t the best in the world, but who can blame it; it’s from 2007! I had barely finished collage for Christ sake. Also when compared to its smoothed out big brother EU4 well I can seem rather flat, but this is not where the magic is.Secondly, the learning curve. Wow, now I’ve played RTS’s but Paradox was all like here is the deep end; to some one whose body was so unprepared for this kind adult swim. Don’t get me wrong it is hard, yes; and the tutorial might as well not exist, but if you have patience (at some points of a god!) then you will be rewarded with a game that you constantly want to re-work and shape to your tyrannical desires. Right, now that’s over positives. Depth of game play. An all encompassing statement I know, but I cannot overstate this enough. If you want to get as close as you can to that real empire builder, the management of All the expenses then here is the game for you. As I said before the learning curve is steep what with having to fight wars, deal with intricate economic politics, diplomatic management that encompasses the entire globe, region culture, religion, crusades, jihads.The list is endless; and so are the out comes no two games are ever the same. One moment your Muscovy and destroying your Russian and Lithuanian nemesis! Then Denmark loses its Personal Union with Sweden, and all of a sudden you have a western power house mercilessly pounding a nail into your snowy Finish skull.This game is so big, so enthralling and ever changing; that it is very difficult to get board of it. Get some friends and jump on multiplayer and you will see just how much bigger this game gets. Get this game!			",11,0,0,3,11,0,16

												This game isn't easy to pick up. The older Paradox games are notorious for their learning curves, and this game is certainly no exception, with its vast and complicated mechanics. Honestly, I spent a longer amount oftime than I'd like to admit only sieging provinces via assault. Still, there's a reason that I've played this game for over one hundred hours, and it's not just because it took me that long to learn how to play; this game is really fun once you get the hang of it. It lacks the polish of the newer games (and I must confess to playing more of those nowadays) but it's still very fun in its own right, and perhaps a better option if you don't want to wait for the next Steam sale. If you're a fan of Strategy, I'd reccomend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game for stradegists.Unlike most games set in the Medieval Era, this game allows you to play and country in the world dating from 1399 to 1821. But the game is very hard to those who haven't played  many strategy games, because it requires you to think hours ahead of the actually action. I recommend this game to strategists everywhere.

												Great Game. Really historical and strategical. The wasteland is kind of restrictive in terms of colonization and the tutorials flat out don't work, but besides that it is a very addicting stratagy game. Only recomended for the pure stratagy lovers (if you think Risk is a long game, I would not recomend this). One of the most historically best maps you will find. This is the most historically acurate game and includes as much history as it can, while still making it fun. Civilization V has just civilizations, and not nearly as many (but each one is unique), with no acurate map included with the game. Total War has an accurate map and great combat systems, but not nearly as many nations and is restricted chronologically. The Europa Universalis is truly the most historical stratagy game series you will find.*Note, this review is for EU3 with Divine Wind			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Defiently one of my favorite games of all time. If you are a fan of history, this is a must. Taking a one province and forging it into an empire is truely satisfiyng as well as ahistorical outcomes such as the one game I played and made a Scottish Canadian Empire and continuously fought the English from a tyranical rule of the British Isles. Or the one game where I reclaimed Isreal from the Ottoman Empire as the Knights of Rhodes. With a little imagination, some luck the possibilities are endless. Defiently not a waste of time despite many hours poured into countless countries and campaigns. Only bad thing is a steep learning curve in the beginning that might disaude people form playing. After a game or two however you immerse yourself in the many aspeects of EU3, you will never regret it! Especially at the price it is right now so cheap for endless hours of entertainment.

												Possibly the most indepth, and complex strategy game I've played, especially for this Era.  Play as any country in the world in the time period of 1400 - 1900. Also has things that need to be taken into account such as inflation, war attrition, country stability, and global reputation (infamy).  Also when you get bored of single player, theres ip/lan (can work at the same time) option, as well as up to 32 player games you can create / join on the main server.A must have for people who love to fiddle and customize their country into the shape they want it to be.  Warning: has a steep learning curve, and their WIKI page is a must read after you start playing the game a bit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off: I have played this game waaay too much. This steam version does include the time I spent playing a bootleg version with a friend of mine in high school. This game was great: I was Berry and he was Austria. By eating France, I became the most dominant power, and though my army was twice as large as his, he got me everytime we went to war through the use of spies. Spies always getting up in my business, rebellions bringing my homeland down to its knees, making a 150+ province berry crumble into a one province theocracy. Good news: His country collapsed similarly, and Europe was liberated from our opressive regime....for about 100 years. Oh, then the cannon balls flew. 10/10.			",17,2,0,8,2,0,6

												Paradox games are the creators of the ultimate strategy games, the first amoung them being EUIII.  Taken to a depth I didn't think possible for a game, it's surprisingly realistic for a 14th-17-th century strategy game.You are literally able to take control of any nation in the world from 1399 to 1600ish.  Along the way historical events occur and are subverted, as chance has it.  The attention to detail is incredible- the decisions you can make vary from tax levying to religious reform to restructuring your government to forming a new nation.This game has a learning curve from hell but it epic as all♥♥♥♥♥♥  Give it a shot.

												Really complete strategy game where you get to control the economic, military and religious parts of a country. You can explore multiple roads to greatness in this game, you can either become the biggest trading republic with monopolies in centers of trade or have a big army and conquer everyone else. It takes a lot of hours to learn how to play properly, but be patient and you'll be rewarded with an awesome experience.			",129,18,2,25,9,0,25

												A very deep and rich strategy game for the mature audiences. There is so much you can do in this game if you put your mind to it. Its well worth learning all this game has to offer in terms of mechanics and strategy. There are some great roleplaying moments as well. The game spans about 300-400 years begining in the 1400th century, with all the exiting historical moments to keep you occupied for hours on end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the fact that Europa Universalis IV released quite a while ago (and improves on many concepts of the series), I still find that this game is actually just as enjoyable as EU4, and maybe even better on multiplayer, which is still working (amazingly).If you're new to the Paradox Interactive series, this is the greatest game to start on, too. It's slightly more forgiving and understandable, and probably not as frustrating.			",55,1,0,15,7,0,14

All in all an excellent game, and it turns out different every time. Always fun to see the Papal States colonise South America..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EU is not for everyone, games are time consuming, the mechanics take a while to master, and sometimes you'll find yourself in an unwinnable war. That having been said, it's still a great series, and EUIII is my favorite installment in it. My total time played may be a bit deceptive seeing as how I have a nasty habit of leaving it paused while I run off to work or have it in the background when I'm doing other things, but I have still spent a considerable amount of time doing everything from rebuilding byzantium to trying to befriend the great powers as a west african state. Great fun and definitely recomended for anyone interested in imersive strategy.			",50,16,0,26,16,0,21
