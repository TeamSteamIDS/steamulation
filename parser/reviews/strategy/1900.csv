												Let me start with saying I am a huge fan of the earth series,-Earth 2160 continues the story of its predecessors through 4 campaigns of around average length that will most likely keep you busy for a while. -The game features 4 very unique races which vary greatly in terms of playstyle.-Lets you modify your units as you see fit to execute their job perfectly.-It comes with a skirmish mode and supports up to 8 players for lan and i-net multiplayer. Has a bunch of extra maps added to it, some of which I recall seeing in fan patches. -The game natviely supports most modern resolutions up to 1920x1080.-Despite its age the graphics are still very neat to look at and features like its day and night cycle make the game quite pretty.-Note: You will have to register the game ingame via its product code allocated by steam to unlock its full content, which might scare some people off but I dont exactly see any harm in it. (not like most modern games dont require you to make accounts :p)Gameplay:Eurasian Dynasty (ED)The ED originated from Russia and while they may not be the fastest, they certainly have some of the toughest units in the game featuring heavy tanks, artillery and bombers. They weaponry ranges from conventional weapons to heat rays.Their basebuilding consists of placing a main 'core' at the center of your base from which you build pipes to connect a variety of structures and generators to power your network of buildings. They can also build walls and a variety of other defenses.Their ressource gathering is done by mobile refineries which can hover from depot to depot and process all ressources gathered on the spot for a steady income.Strength: Very tough units, able to turtle quite well using a ring of walls around the mainframe, simple ressource gatheringWeakness: Slow units, buildings are vulnerable to get disconnected from the frame and can get disabled due to lack of power, basebuilding takes up a lot of time and needs to be planned ahead a bit in order to make room for future buildings.United Civilized States (UCS)The UCS originated from the United states of america, they have a variety of mechs and jets at their disposal and use a lot of energy based weaponry as well as ballistic missiles.Their basebuilding is probably the most 'normal' and executed by flying drones that place structures which then build themselves as they drain the ressources needed. Their bases have the unique feature to use add-ons to enhance buildings in a specific way, such as making generators create more power or making refineries generate more income.Their ressource gathering is rather traditional and has flying harvesters land on top of the ressources, gathering them and returning back to the nearest refinery for dropoff.Strength: Fairly easy to master, strong missiles backed up by laser weapons, simple basebuilding which doesnt need babysitting. Can place turrets and walls to some extend to provide decent defense. Can teleport freshly trained units.Weakness: Their structures while efficient can get costy to replace with a bunch of add-ons added to them and expanding to get more ressources does require you to set up additional outposts. Their laser weaponry is prone to get tackled by shields early on which renders them inefficient.Lunar Corporation (LC)The LC created orbital colonies and initially settled down on the Moon. They were able to study alien technology and feature the most advanced weaponry out of all the races. Their vehicles are hovertanks, infantry has jetpacks and aircraft are speedy.Basebuilding for the LC means placing a basic module on the ground and stacking other modules on top to create a tower which depending on modules you places can fill in a variety of roles from research and unit training to combat modules to turn them into tough fortresses. They can also place external turrets and laser walls and all structures can be placed anywhere as they are dropped in from the sky. (you can only call in a limited number of buildings at a time though)Their ressource gathering is as simple as dropping a mining base next to a ressource field. They will harvest and process it automatically.Strength: Some of the fastest units in the game, very strong weaponry that is specialized to usually fit a single purpose, probably have the ability to expand in terms of ressources easier than any other race, can build foward or hidden bases anytime, anywhere.Weakness: Due to their 'stacking' mechanic of modules their structural integrity is often at risk and they are prone to have their buildings get sniped which are even more expensive to replace than fully modded ucs building, their early game units while fast are fairly weak in terms of hp.AliensThe aliens are a new addition in Earth 2160 and feature the most unique playstyle using cloning and evolution to create their units and having no ressource gathering in the traditional way.They can morph strong defensive structures which are able to provide heavy cover for units while they clone and evolve or block off ressource points from your enemies.Instead of ressource gathering their units absorb a small amount of ressources to evolve into different species, starting with a basic unit that has no way of attacking and a basic mothership you have to clone them to create more and evolve those into different strands to create the perfect army. Note: It is advised that you keep at the very least one basic unit to replicate as you might be unable to reproduce if you dont!Strength: Strong structures, heaviest aircraft in the game, fast and lethal units, can easily poke at hostile bases and harass them.Weakness: Beyond static turrets no way to defend yourself, take great amounts of planning and macro management to keep track of your units and their evolutions, easy to get harassed and crippled if cloning units are exposed.Virtual Agents:Virtual Agents are 'Hero units' which will offer their services for the highest bidder. As Aliens have no means to store ressources they are unable to obtain any. Agents pop up every now and then , initially after a few minutes three random ones will pop up and ask if the player wants to hire them. You have to be quick and go for whichever suits you best or simply bid on them all if you feel generous with your ressources. Your enemies also have the chance to obtain them and can make them a better offer. In the end they will join whichever side is willing to spend the most money on them.Once hired you can spawn the VA anywhere you like and they will remain in your service for a limited amount of time till their contract expires, after which you have to pay them again. If they get killed their contract is also terminated.Those Virtual agents offer a variety of bonuses for certain playstyles, such as reducing the cost of flying units by 25% or having your ground units start as veterans. The VA's also come in a variety of shapes and often are a powerful unit on their own that if used right can pack quite a punch.You can have up to 3 agents at a time which will most likely start to chat with one another at some point. This usually leads to quite some hilarious conversations which might entertain you if you like bad puns and sarcastic comments.Note: Virtual Agents can be disabled during game setup if you dont want to have them around.Thats about all I can tell ya, if youd like to know more you should just take the game for a spin, especially since its currently on offer for a laughable price. The rts genre usually doesnt bring forth as many games as other genres do currently which is why many of us still play 'older' games to pass the time.This one is a little gem, sure has its flaws but it can be a bunch of fun, especially if you're looking to get it to play with some friends of yours who are also willing to spend a single dollar or euro to get it.

												Earth 2160 is the third game in Earth 21XX series, a polish RTS that tried to put small innovative features. It came out in 2005 and then got Steam release in 2006, quiet early stuff. Didn't get any expansion packs, unlike Earth 2140 and 2150.So, let's get to technical part. Around half of negative reviews that you see over this game comes from people beliving that game requires full registration, with your name, adress and such, for it to work fully. Actually, what is required is ""Activation"", which is inputting CD-key and then authorizing it on Internet, while ""Registration"" is optional and can be skipped. It's like in old PC games where they would ask if you want to ""Register Now"" after installing the game.On bad side, some people on forum seemed to have trouble with CD-key itself. I don't know, I had no problem there, but maybe it's related to reinstallation on different computer.Surprisingly, widescreen is supported and works as intended, so to say. Even interface looks fine. But widescreen will often show parts of game's cutscenes that weren't supposed to be seen. You will often see that space background is just textured wall that was placed over the ground of current's level, not helping immerison.As for multiplayer, it's either local or Internet. And Internet option is possible only through EarthNet, which, from what I heard, was shut down a while ago. To be honest, I didn't bother to check past account registration for that. And I doubt that many people were playing it nowdays. But could be wrong. I, myself, count that multiplayer is dead there.Story is that all 3 factions escaped Earth as it was about to be burned by sun. Lunar Corporation, an advanced faction of womans who lived on moon previously, came to Mars first. Eurasian Dynasty, soviet-like faction from Earth, arrived later and now tries to take it's place in solar system. In meanwhile there were no news about starship of United Civilized States, factions that uses robots heavily, even as leaders. And then some self-cloning aliens started to pop up.At the core, Earth 2160 is same old classic spammy RTS, which was getting old as W40k: Dawn of War came out year before. Classic because it still makes you build bases, command directly any amount of units you want and has limited recources, making you move around. Spammy because you want to have more many buildings to produce many units to send into battles. You would even want to have no less than three research centers, otherwise you will not be able to research everything needed even in a hour. It did introduce population cap, but it means that you have to build lots of storages.It takes some features from Earth 2140, some from Earth 2150 and doesn't forget to bring it's own. From Earth 2140 it got Infantry. Doesn't play with idea of any kind of friendly general AI this time around though. In all honesty, I didn't find Infantry useful outside of early Skirmish games. They die very quickly and don't seem to be cheap enough by comparison to spamming light mechanized units. They can capture the buildings or something, but base defences in this part are too strong to allow that.From 2150 it keeps customization of non-infantry units. It kinda improves, as you get to choose a bit more. Though, some chassis allow only some kind of weapons, but seeing how you get to choose from 4 types most often anyway, it's still awesome. And yes, it's built with counter mechanics in mind. You want to put armor against what your opponent uses and put weapons that will counter his units. 2160 is quite focused on countering: if you try to use laser weapon on unit with reflective armor it may take half of a minute to destroy it, while with counter it would have took just few short seconds. Goes same for base defences, you either use artilery or die.No, they didn't keep those clunky tunnel mechanics and basic terraforming it had. It's already overwhelming with all features that 2160 got.And 2160 adds Aliens race and makes the 3 factions from 2150 even more unique to each other. They also gave us aircraft that you have to manually call to attack something from airbase. Sadly, they are bad. They have to see object the whole time that they get there. As soon as, say, your soldiers get destroyed around turrets and fog of war covers it, they will immeditly turn back around and will refuse to bomb anything until they return. And they added Virtual Agents. In campaign they are heroes who have inventory. Outside Campaign they are powerful units, who give passive benefits to your base, while being strong enough to possibly turn the tide of battle early in the match. The interesting part is the way you hire them when they randomly pop-up: it works like auction between all players! The highest bidder get them. Is it worth chasing after the increasing price? Or maybe you want to increase price for other players? Or maybe you are just trying to stale time while you are winning the battle? Fun addition. They also bring in a bit of personality, each with it's own car and even recognising and chatting with each other.Races are mostly different in the way that they set up a base. As well as many smaller changes in units. Or the way that they use only two recources out of three available. It's a good fun to learn them all.ED connects buildings around colony base with pipes. They can also build walls with wall turrets they can slide around freely. LC build tall towers, placing additional buildings on top of a main base. UCS feel mroe traditional by comparison, but they put 6 of basic buildings into field and then build additonal upgrade-buildings on sides of them. Aliens just clone and upgrade, sucking nearby needed recource.Hm, I remember reading interview where developer warned that LC towers shouldn't be built too close together as they may fall onto each other if root building is destroyed. Sadly, no physics feature made it into final game. The only physic thing that remains are rocks that you can shoot at in campaign.It has a campaign which is nice on theory, all four races being connected by ongoing storyline, while game slowly introduces you to game mechanic. But it's flawed kind of RTS campaign, where each mission drags on slowly, with times when you don't have anything much to multitask or to even do. And sometimes it's also difficult in such way that you will have to replay it. Like, in the last mission of ED the heavy weapons of tanks get disabled and you have to find traitor, who spawns in only when that happens. And you don't know where traitor. So you better restart mission and pre-place units in location where traitor will spawn, otherwise waves of Alien forces will overwhelm you. And well, I gave up on campaign at that point, kinda was too bored in some spots.Skirmish is quite intense and fun by comparison. Don't expect AI to ever let you space to breath after five minutes or so. Now, he is weak if you expand early and take all recources for yourself, but if you let him have some bases for itself, he will not be so weak. He may even wreck you good. If at one moment you will be destroying his army with laser weapon, then in next moments you will be facing laser-resistant army that will be destroy yours in seconds instead.It's a shame that audio-visual enjoyment is a bit more lacking when compared to 2150. That game had different soundtrack for each faction, shame that 2160 uses only one for everybody. While graphics were spectacular when it came out, with bump-shading even on infantry and cool special effects, I felt that more atmospherical effects were lacking. Like explosions on ground. Or lighting during night. In 2150 it was looking great to see bases slowly activating red and white colored lights. Kinda weak here.So, it's RTS which is usual at core but tries to be unique with it's own features, not unlike other Earth 21XX games. It's a bit clumpsy, a bit too spammy. Still joy to try all factions.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												This is one of the best RTS game released in 2005 but graphics and design still very impressive even in today's standard the gameplay is deep with technology research ,units customizing and unique base building techniques for each faction. Earth series very powerful brand in strategy games. if you didn't play earth series game before (earth 2140,earth 2150) I recommend you to read this wiki page to understand the story behind each faction in earth 2160 (Eurasian Dynasty, United Civilized States, Lunar Corporation, Aliens) . http://earthseries.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Wiki ",75,0,1,1,5,0,37

												To all those who complain about the supposed need to give out personal info: LEARN TO READ.You do not need to register to play the full game, just UNCHECK the box for registration and press the internet activation button and you are done. Honestly, if you tell the game to register, then of course you have to give your name, birthdate and co., but you only have to ACTIVATE.All those thumbs down to a generally decent game, just because they cant read properly. Steam should delete such invalid reviews and never give refunds for this game if such a reason is given.I admit, I at first didnt read properly myself, but then i just used the back button and read properly, noticing the checkbox for the registration with no problem at all.

 ""Leadership comes in small acts as well as bold strokes.” Earth 2160 is a very good real-time strategy game with four unique factions, a remarkable grade of unit customization and broad spectrum of tactical opportunities. The most interesting aspect of the game lies within the customization of the loadouts of individual units upon construction, while progressing through the impressive research tree.Compared with the predecessors the differences and specific characteristics of the factions were further developed (e.g. unique base building and unit types).In addition the micromanagement of units and buildings has been simplified. On the other hand the clarity of the user interface still remains an issue, which would have needed more attention. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												Featuring four races, each unique and interesting in their own way, Earth 2160 has an average storyline that doesn't really enthrall or engage in any way. There are three groups left from Earth who are fighting it out and trying to maintain a foothold in the future of mankind. Add to that an interesting alien race that has some especially unique features, and you have a recipe for a fun game. Earth 2160 has a campaign for each of the four groups: The European Dynasty, Lunar Corporation, and Union of Civilized States represent the groups from Earth, and the aliens representing the fourth playable race. If you're looking for a deep single-player experience, you're sure to find it with Earth 2160, as it takes time to work through the campaigns for all four groups.During the campaigns, you'll find out that each group really is different and depends upon a certain strategy to achieve victory. Another great aspect is the ability to research and create new units to combat the enemy tactics you encounter. Unfortunately, if you find yourself up against a unit that your newly created and research units are ill-equipped to defend against, you'll quickly find yourself on the losing side of the battle. Relying on a single strategy, weapon, or defense type will quickly lead to defeat. The key in Earth 2160 is to maintain a constant vigilance and be on the lookout for what sorts of technologies your enemies are employing, and work to create your own units to combat them. There is a ton of strategy involved in this, and it works to great effect.The interface for getting around, controlling your units, building your bases, and handling other options is a bit clunky. There are icons that have convenient tool tips that appear, which makes things a lot easier, but when you're looking for a specific action, you don't want to have to hover your mouse over each icon to find the one you are looking for.Graphically, the game is one of the best looking real-time strategy games I've ever played. You can zoom in to insane levels, and each unit looks as good up close as it does from a distance. Battles between groups of enemies are fantastically exciting and explosive looking, providing a brilliant show that almost overshadows the results. The environments are large and pleasant to look at, and once you've gotten your bases built up and lined with defenses, it's like gazing at a landscape straight out of a science fiction movie. One of the coolest things is the transition from day to night; watching your units light up the night is extremely cool. Another great graphical aspect is the trails that your vehicles leave on the ground. Tire treads, steps, it all looks amazing and comes together to form a fantastic-looking experience.Sound, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. One of the worst aspects of Earth 2160 are the voiceovers. The soundtrack is pretty good, and changes with the action, which is nice. It's nothing really excellent, but it does provide ambience and helps with the suspenseful atmosphere.There is a skirmish mode as well as multiplayer, and if you get tired of the lengthy campaign, you can always find a friend to play against or take on the computer in the skirmish battles.Earth 2160 is an excellent title that is sure to stand the test of time for real-time strategy fans.

												10 years after initial release and the game is still amazing.  4 different factions to play, one with extremely different technology then the others.  The three primary factions have serious differences beyond what you see in similiar RTS games from the last ten years.  Played this game not only on Steam but also via CD and DVD versions.  Only flaw in the game was too small an advertising budget.  After many hours of playing I discovered the first person view for your units, pretty cool in an RTS.  Even more features remain to be discovered in this gem.			",277,30,2,66,42,0,107

												So, Earth 2160 it is. I first heard about the series many years ago. I only played Earth 2150 back then, but then I heard about Earth 2160 about 6 years ago and decided to try it. To my surprise, it came out to be a fantastic game. Much better, than its predecessor, the 3D setting of this game is quite revolutionary for a 2006 strategy game! I love it! And the gameplay? Amazing! You can customize your units as you wish, give them many different weapons, and level them up. Though, there are some unsatisfying things. When playing against the Alien race, the LC faction is quite weak against them. The second thing - you can't really tell what damage you are getting from the aliens... I tried all kinds of armor against them and none worked... Also, it seems like the shields aren't doing their job... they SHOULD absorb all kinds of damage... and not let any projectiles or beams through... so devs, PLEASE, patch these glitches to perfect this game! It's already a beautiful game as it is, and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this to any RTS lover! Enjoy! :)			",61,2,0,22,3,0,10

												Gameplay is gr8glitches kind of mess it up, such as the glitch where the infantry go inside each other, this isnt a prob tho because infantry is almost useless. XDmissions can be kind of boring at a few times, but skirmish is fun AF.I remember playing this game a long time ago :P had so much fun, i love how the game updated! Good work guys! x3I dont see a problem with the registration thing because maybe steam doesnt support the network for them... I mean they do have their own website...the dialogue for anything without a helmet is ridiculous... theyre saying somethin like ""Ok, I will meet you at the Kitten Lab"" and it looks like theyre saying something like bla aaa la la play il lalolThe story is great, some things could be added but my favorite part about this was the mass amount of units and structures.complete the registry form or your a noob.gj m16a4's			",43,9,1,5,13,1,12

												Best RTS ever? Well there is 2150 but 2160 is at least as good. What surprises me is that not only it is an absolute classic, but also, it runs perfectly, or was adapted flawlessly to modern OS/PCs. The AI doesn't let you fool around much, even on easy, if you like challenges this is the one. Graphics still look really good too! Best Topware game easily.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Earth 2160... Where do I start? This game is buggy, central multiplayer server is dead (altrough direct connect still works and will most likely work forever), lots of mechanics are annoying, DRM activation works but demands your personal data......And despite of that, this is one of the most enjoyable, complex strategies you will ever see! I am writing this review over 10 years since the game release and it is still unbeatable when it comes to many aspects.Let's start with factions: there are few of them and all of them are completely different - not just when it comes to most obvious things like visuals or different ""game finisher"" end-game units, but also the way they build the base (and not even single faction reminds typical strategy, with most familar one being UCS), recruit their units, research technologies and how their army fights. In addition (major spoiler alert) one of factions don't even have buildings except turrets at all, but their units can duplicate and evolve to the more advanced forms. The biggest differences are in base building:UCS base building look most similar to other RTS games, but all their buildings are semi-modular, meaning you can extend them with additional parts (for example, refinery can be extended with parts giving additional extractors or with storage facilities raising your population cap). Their energy network is rather crude, with power plants as separate buildings and need to build energy relays to extend the network.ED bases are basically huge, modular buildings - complexes with multiple power generators, barracks, storage facilities, turrets etc. connected together. The only constructions that can be built disconnected from complexes are walls and turrets that can move on these walls like on rails. Energy pool of this faction is bound to single complex (but you can have more than just one).LC philosophy is ""build up, not wide"": their bases tend to be relatively small compared to all other factions, you can stack most buildings on each other as long as tower is kept at sane height (if you have big towers close to each other, destruction of one will start domino effect). Their walls are made from energy walls connected with turrets, in addition attempt to fly over them will result with turret insta-killing the enemy air units with energy ray. It is the only faction with global energy pool.Micromanagement which is very common in this game might be seen as pro or con - this is matter of preference, altrough in case of one of factions amount of micromanagement grows exponentially with game duration and quickly reaches stage in which it is very difficult to take care of everything needed.From technical side, game have some serious flaws when it comes to pathfinding: land units have big troubles finding a path to the target, it is almost impossible to get them out of complex base, armies with different move targets will often block each other. AI don't really ""know"" how to play using ED faction, but can be challenging especially when playing against Morphidians, but don't really expect any surprises from it. Graphics are still relatively good for over 10 year old game, with nice looking physics and big attention to details like visual representation of damage. Music is nice, but don't expect hearing too much of it - something is wrong with music system, so it plays very rarely. Sounds are acceptable.If you look for very good, complex RTS with base building + careful resource management and bugs/other annoyances don't scare you - then this is the game for you, especially if you have few friends to play with. If you look for something similar, but more modern and polished - trying Grey Goo might be good idea (that game takes most of its gameplay elements from Earth 2160, but simplifies them and removes most of micromanagement).

												Earth 2160 is a great game but might not appeal to everyone.The game seems a bit outdated by today standards, especially graphics wise. Furthermore it's a somewhat slow paced game that requires time and thought put into it.It's a science-fiction based RTS game featuring advanced base building, ressource gathering and combat. The economic aspect of the game is quite basic. Gather ressources to fund your base and units, base building is pretty extensive depending on the factions. The combat is quite good but challenging. One of the most important mechanics is the unit customization, through research you can design your own units with various strengths and weaknesses. This allows for some major tactical planning and you really need to think what type of unit is effective against another type of unit. Overall this mechanic is very rewarding but can be frustrating. Sometimes your units will just be annihilated and you won't have the time or patience to find a new design that suits your needs.Two aspects of this game that I find very appealing are the factions and the campaigns. The factions are completely different and feel distinct. Each faction has a unique way of playing and focus, some have completely different structures and designs that opt for different playstyles. The mission campaigns are extremely well done, especially for an rts game. You have dialogues and cutscenes, some rpg elements as well and a decent storyline. Furthermore you will have several campaigns at your disposal to play.The multiplayer is seviceable and works quite well. So are the graphics and soundtrack. Nothing to complain about.

												Weaker than Earth 2150 but still an underrated and decent RTS game that brought some interesting changes into the franchise for the better and the worse.Also:Aliens are interesting but you may or may not like them as a playable faction or as your enemies.

Fortunately, my judgement was wrong and I have been enjoying the game so far. The graphic quality commendable considering that this was released 8 years ago.

												Although it is getting pretty dated by this point, this is a pretty good game for fans of the old Westwood Command and Conquer type games.  That's pretty much what it is: You mine resources to build units which have been researched.  You protect your base with some while wiping out the enemy base with others.  It is nice that there are at least three different 'factions' in the game, each with their own completely different technology trees, which keeps it interesting for quite some time.  The characters and story are pretty corny, but fortunately, they don't get in the way much.			",157,20,3,19,15,0,27

												It's awesome with explosions!!!Edit: Overall I liked this game, but it does have it's failings.Pros:Great graphicsAwesome looking basesInteresting UI that can be quite powerful once you figure it outRebindable keysAwesome base building mechanics, which are different for each factionLots of tanksLots of explosionsCons:UI is still clunkier than DoW or StarcraftHardcounters are way too OP, for example, most units do 30% of their regular damage vs buildings, while artillery does 1000% their regular damage vs buildings, meaning they can kill a building in 2 shots while your entire army does no damage at all to the enemy base.  This even extends to regular units, for example, if you have a tank with regular armor, it will only take 10% damage from regular attacks, but 100% from everything else.  So if you happen to guess what the enemy is using, they're ♥♥♥♥ed, if you guess wrong, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.Unit customization only leads to more hardcounters, and doesn't really give you much freedomAnti-missile defenses don't work properlyUnits feel cartoony and wimpy compared to Earth 2140			",21,8,0,9,11,1,27

												That's a tough one ,hard to review it ,haven't played it too much yet but as an RTS superfan ,I loved it! It has great mechanics ,the 4 factions are completely different which is just awesome ,3 different recources make the make even more fun. The only 2 things I don't like are: The graphics ,well it's an old game so the graphics are obviously outdated but for some people it may really feel annoying (Not for me though) , the second problem is that basically ,there's not tutorial whatsoever ,you should have to practice and discover the game yourself through skirmish mode. (As I did) Hell ,you have to make your own units as one of the factions which is great but might be really REALLY hard for beginners. Overall a decent RTS game!			",21,3,0,4,1,0,13

												No matter what I say, I think http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976344679/recommended/1900/ summed it up best.There's too much good about this game to list, so I'll list the negatives, what few there are.1: Strike + Return aircraft seem a little bugged as they'll just dryhump their taget unless you micro them well (they also can only target they can't ""move"")2: The voice acting was much better in the previous installments.3: Aliens (as the new race) are pretty crappy as they don't build bases and are venerable to being out-rushed, hard countered, out-turtled, etc.But hey, endless custimization, 3½ vastly unique playable factions, super weapons, FPS unit control (granted you use arrow-keys to move), fun with friends (Use ""GameRanger"" as the servers are sketchy otherwise), continued campaign (not as good as 2150s campaign, but doesn't have the timer), and... Well really it's the custimization that I absolutely love.  Why ""recruit"" units when you can DESIGN units.Your army is obsolete?  Destory and improve...			",394,68,7,64,48,5,91

Still if you want something similar with beautiful diversity, maps, unique wall system, and a really neat PIP-window mode that allows first or third-person viewing of a platoon of your battling troops in a picture-in-picture while you command your standard starcraft style screen; this game is a fun piece of unique diversity in the RTS universe, and the AI can be quite interesting.

												The only real downside to this game is the fact that you need a registration giving personal info, that is only due to the fact its run by a third party site. The glitches everyone else brings up dont effect overall gameplay. For one example, when cloning multile Martian Queens (as the alien race) one may be encircled and will be stuck until the rest are move. Yes that is annoying but you can work by it. For me, the game doesn't crash, the exit button is just EVERYWHERE, if you see a message saying 'Are you sure you want to exit?' and you are just trying to leave a menu click no and use the back button. You we all must admit, these graphics are just (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)👌 for 2006.			",85,14,0,14,17,0,17

												It's a fun game, but some flaws are really stupid/maddening:- Your troops won't attack the nearest enemy on their own. Seriously, if you leave your guys unattended and the enemy attacks en masse, there's a really high chance your troops will try and pursue the farthest unit, ignoring everything else.- Only ""Hold Fire"" and ""Pursue Enemy"", no ""Defensive"" stance (if you've ever played Age of Empires 2, you know how much of a difference the 4 stances make when leaving troops unattended)- Order too many troops from point A to B and they'll happily move in a line (like in C&C Generals), easy pickings for entrenched enemies- Tech Tree is somewhat confusing.- Fog of War is a static on areas you haven't explored yet. Without shades/shadows like in C&C Generals or Age of Empires, enemies simply ""pop up"" from nowhere, since you don't know what is your exact visible field.The game does have some really interesting points, though:- Factions are VERY different, from base building to unit training- You can edit your units and create variants with parts you researchI won't recommend this game to anyone but RTS junkies			",184,13,3,15,11,5,33

												Quite a nice RTS, dunno how I missed it when it first came out. Bought it when ported to  GNU/Linux. The game falls short of Starcraft (either 1 or 2) but is way better than other contemporary games, like Red Alert or Tiberian Sun. The graphics are good, but surely dated.The game is somewhat complex (which means less fast than say, SC), it has 3 different resources, but every race uses only 2. You get a lot of micro management, like drivers can exit vehicles, soldiers level up, you can design vehicles (from limited options) and you have ""hero"" units (called agents). Base building is great, and varies a lot depending on what race you choose.The races are kinda reminiscent of SC, but each has it's original story and characteristics (not widely original though). You got the soviet like Dinasty, with heavy units, the United Civilized States, more agile and fully robotised (some units kinda look like T-800), aliens that look half like a zerling, half like a bug from Starship troopers, and the all female Lunar Corporation, that looks like they come from a 1970's Sci-Fi film.Bottom line: Get it if you liked RTS 10 years ago, but don't expect it to be up to today's RTS standards.

												I can see why this game has mixed reviews. Beyond the registration thing, which I didn't really mind (just lie about everything), the game itself leaves much to be desired.Graphics weren't great, but I didn't expect much. I don't need a good looking game if the mechanics are solid.As for mechanics: the first mission, they tell you that you need to rescue some soldier that were captured. okay, let's go! The strategy of this seemed to boil down to ""BUM-RUSH, LOSE A WAVE OF MEN TO KILL ONE ENEMY MACHINE, REPEAT UNTIL YOU'VE CLEARED TURRETS, ETC."" Summary: even if you buy this super cheap, it probably won't be a heavily played part of your library. Note: I will try a different campaign and see if this changes anything. Maybe just that mission or faction is crappy.			",107,10,1,25,23,0,39

												After playing Earth 2160 for awhile. I have to say it's a really good game. The one major thing I like about the game is the fact you can custimize your own troops with Armor, Weapon, Speed, Shield/Repair to help you fight against the race you are facing. There is tons of different unit combinations you can choose from for each race and it brings out the full RTS.The Battles are fairly epic as well. If you are just trying it out, I recommand to play on easy difficulty. Medium/Hard is over the top for the AI's on some parts so you have a good challenge and epic battles. Overall the game is entirly just fun. Sometimes you can get lost in it and lose track of time from having so much fun.			",226,33,7,56,61,3,124

												It is a simple strategy game, which pretty cool mechanics where you may have your soldiers defending posts and even taking cover in some bunkers. The mechanism to collect the provisions is also cool and interesting, even though there is not much to this. The game plays well and looks well, so why the negative recommendation? Well, the drm is pretty bad and pretty much spoils the entire thing. If you can, somehow, endure it, then, well, you may as well buy the game, since it is pretty cheap and you can get for a pretty cheap price in a sale.

												a rather cheap and amazing game all 4 races fight and play entirely different, each race harvest 2 out of the 3 resource types, this allows for some diversity among the factions.The UCS are a faction that is entirely populated by machines, there entire army is mechanical walkers that are usually in between the speed and Armor of their enemies. The UCS build a central hub and attach 4 other buildings to that structure their mines are built as a refinery which sends out termites that harvest metal and crystal.The LC are a faction who ever soldier seems to be female, their vehicle style is entirely hover tanks, the fastest units in the game but not very armored. their buildings are built on top of one another as towers, while their mines are planted by the resource and mine directly from it, harvesting crystal & water.The ED build by connecting each base to a central hub, this provides their bases with a decent defense, their vehicle style is tanks they are usually the slowest but have the best armor. The Ed mine by using mobile miners that just sit on the resources harvesting metal & water constantly.The Aliens, are an entirely mobile and aggressive force moving from resource site to resource site absorbing a different resource depending upon what breed of alien is feeding, to allow them to grow in-strength and size. they don't build a base instead their morphidian units clone themselves after absorbing enough water, or metal or crystal. this also allows that unit to then evolve into a new breed of Alien soldier or vehicle equivalent.overall a good game although still slightly flawed but the only flaw with 2160 is they took out my underground bases from 2150..

												The game is addictive.  The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack sets the mood.  The AI is challenging and realatively adaptive.  It is reminiscent of Warzone 2100 in that you can design units, albeit with some limitations.  My only complaint is that you can get into situations where cheats are almost nessecary.  On big plus for me is that there is no hard unit cap, only what you have built as far as structures.  If you want a fast paced RTS, then you will enjoy this.  Be warned though, if you want to avoid cheating, have a good idea of what your faction has available. ",84,6,0,18,5,0,20

And I found myself enjoying every moment of it, wanting to play more even after I collected all of the cards.A must-have must-play for those skeptical of the RTS genre, it will bring you into it and this is a good place to start.  Even if you're not into  science fiction or the whole futuristic outerspace scenario. I would still recommend this title as I think it is much better than the original Stacraft or of the older Red Alert series. Be sure to find the class that suits you best.HINT: This game doesn't have a complete tutorial or at least I didn't find one yet aside from it telling you how to build, so it might take some prior RTS experience to be fully competent at this game.

												i like u can modify ur units, what weapon, what armor what kind of engine, shield ect. so many possibilities to create different units. also each Faction has its own diferent styles, the maps are incredible. the one thing i dislike is if there is a lake or large mass of water it does not♥♥♥♥♥♥as water resource there for it cant be harvested. other then that the game itself is really fun.

												Playing this game is fun. I have a steam version and I still have to go through ridiculous actication process(and this process is soooo not fun and stupid that I do not recommend buying this game)... Wnat is the point in that? I am using Linux and obviously my ""hardware"" and ""OS"" are simulated by wine for this game(which would be fine unless... stupid activation process that requires them to stay the same). I am using not just Linux, I am using Gentoo Linux, which is one of those distros that has continous release. That means my OS can change every day meaning I might have to re-active the game every time I run it. So, I decided I want to play this game on my machine, I started it and... it is not activeted... wtf... okay, lets spend 30 minutes providing all the data it needs(your full name, full address, zip code, gender, etc....) to be activated again... oh they gave me a code that I have to re-enter every single time even when it is already activated? Oh, I remeber that I already had that lots-of-digits-code somewhere and lost it... Oh, well, the time I had has passed, I did not play the game and now I have to do other things... and the attemt to actually play made me upset...Activating this game it so frustrating... and honestly, I just should not have to do it at all, since I am plaing it through steam! Steam already has all my information and proof that I legaly bought that game. Cost of the time I spent on going through activatoin/registering the game is many times more than the game's price. If I had lower moral standards I would probably pirate/hack/disassemble this game, since it would cost me less time and nerves than legaly play it!It thinks I am using NVIDIA GTX 470, but my actuall GPU is NVIDIA Quadro K4200. Which one should I enter in the actication menu? What about my OS? MS Windows XP something something(exact version simulated by wine version THEY provide) or something like ""4.4.21-gentoo #2 SMP Fri Oct 21 19:36:30 MDT"" or simply ""Gentoo GNU/Linux""? It also wants to know my sound card - hm, well it is part of the chipset(Intel HD audio? or should I write Pulseaudio/ALSA instead?), so I do not even know what to enter in that field. Game wants to know my personal phone numer, and e-mail(those are mandatory fields) - so they are probably going to send me a message to verify my number and when it is verified send some third-party spam?(who knows) Game also wants my full postal address, are they going to send me some mail. Well, good thing I do not have to enter my SSN and driver lisence number. The fact that this game requires me to enter all that information in order to ""verify"" my copy of the game(which is already veryfied by me purchasing it though steam) makes me think that the data they collect is collected intentionally in order to be missused even if they claim otherwise. Their FAQ says the game does not send the data it collects to their servers, though all those fields with personal information are mandatory.			",59,5,0,4,9,1,22

												Short version:Don't buy, bad game, waste of money.Longer version:Earth 2140 was solid RTS game, Earth 2150 (TMP/LS) was very good one. Earth 2160 is awful. I'm big fan of the series, but honestly, I can't say many good things about Earth 2160.pros:+ graphics+ return of infantry units+ experience is gained by pilots rather than vehiclescons:- balance (Morphid air fleet is virtually indestructible)- cliched story (in E2140/E2150 story didn't actually matter, in E2160 we get mix of all sci-fi movie themes you can imagine)- pitiful voice acting (actors don't even pretend to try)- missions (""good old"" objectives like ""get from point A to point B"" or ""gather resources and wipe enemy base(s)"")- ""improvments"" to good ideas from E2150 (research tree now fits into one screen, too bad it looks as if someone barfed on the screen, different armour types introduce mess and confusion rather than diversity)- soundtrack (it isn't bad actually, but there are very few tracks that are faction exclusive, it's huge step backwards compared to Earth 2150)- activation (it kind of made sense when game was released, but now it's just ridiculous, on the other hand - LC campaign is broken and, as far as I remember, multiplayer servers are down, so going through activation process is pointless)- AI (I was playing last mission in ED campaign on hardest difficulty and I was surprised how AI was ""sending small groups of units to certain death"", in the same mission AI ground units were getting stuck over and over in narrow valley)			",655,202,10,77,56,3,94

												sadly, i felt that this is a rush tactic game like the old Age of Empires, it bugs me that when you build an army you have to control specific unit types to gain the best combat advantage, this game will punish royally the person who builds 1 unit type as the AI will just build its counter so you end up having to rebuild constantly. saying that, the AI is quite responsive but at times will mass produce rush units that are a pain in the harris.now this game is not my personal preference, i'm pretty sure theres peeps out there that thrive on this type of micro management of units but its something thats been around since westwoods Battle for Dune on the Saga and it naffed me off back then.so basically its a rock paper scissors using tanks etc incorporating expansion and domination like every other game of this genre, i dont feel this brings anything new and is over shadowed by more up to date games.its old, not very pretty and is fun for a select fan base.  buy on sale if at all			",93,10,0,14,22,0,19

												One of the most difficult RTS games I have ever played, and still one of the most entertaining despite a somewhat buggy client and no longer supported multiplayer servers.Each race has a different building style, and you are able to customize and build different units.  The customization adds an interesting level of change to a game because if you research heavy into laser based weaponry and your opponent recognizes a pattern they may start to develop more units with reflective shielding making your units less effective and forcing you to change to rockets or bio weapons.  Paying attention to little details like the animations of weapons fire, or looking at the type of armor units are equipped with can be really important.To wrap up, if you are a hardcore RTS fan this game may be for you because of the difficulty and complexity.  If you're a beginner or unwilling to look past a games flaws to see how much it actually has to offer, then you should probably stay away from this one.			",331,40,6,86,26,3,60

It's so complex: armor type, damage type, different kinds of evolving systems.One species build towers, one builds a maze, one have no buildings at all, etc.One species have tanks you need to develop and plan before you make them, one species have units that develop themselfes.It's really interesting, didn't play much, but it was worth it.

												I came across this title when it was around a dollar, and even at the normal five bucks it's more than worth it.Let's get the cons out of the way first: the game explains almost nothing, and has tooltips that simply describe what a building or unit or upgrade is within the universe rather than WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES in game  For example, there are base upgrades for the UCS that use random technobabble instead of describing it as ""provides more power to the UCS power plants"" and such.  It gets confusing, and you mostly have to learn by trial and error.  I imagine the campaign may help and serve as a sort of tutorial, but I never made it past the first mission.The tech tree for each race is also fairly overwhelming at first glance, and you basically need to sit alone with the aliens for a match or two to slowly figure out how they work.  Again, trial and error. Also, the AI is extremely hard.  Even on the easiest difficulty, my friend and I who are fairly new at the game have to go two against one, and often barely scrape by with wins.  Granted, we are new, but the easy AI should not be anywhere NEAR this hard.  It's fairly ludicrous.Also, the factions don't appear to be very well balanced, at least in the vanilla (un modded) game.  Late game, aliens are invincible in most cases.And now to the pros!The factions in this game are my favorite I have ever seen in an RTS, and I am not exaggerating.  They all feel COMPLETELY different, unlike most games where the factions are basically reskins of each other, build slightly differently, etc.. It is quite fun learning how to play each of them, and figuring out which one best suits your style.  The three non-alien races have their own different tech trees, and you can also construct custom units to make the perfect army.Another thing: the battles are epic in every sense of the word.  Just in the last match I was playing, my friend and I were fighting with the computer over the middle ground of the map.  My buddy was the alien faction and moved in with large cruisers, while I supported him from the ground with anti-AA tanks (in this game, you can build custom units with different weapons equipped: in this case I outfitted tanks with anti-rocket flares, which protect your air from AA rockets).  The computer mobbed at us with endless anti-air units and large mechs, which my flare tanks mostly took care of, while both sides were being bombared with long-range artillery from each player.  Random other ground-on-ground tanks battled in the middle.  Lasers and flares and rockets all exploded overhead, and explosions were everyhwere.  Battles like this happen all the time in Earth 2160.  It's extremely fascinating to watch, and the game gets incredibly intense in pitched fights.This is probably the longest review on the game, so I will shorten it up and conclude with this:Yes, it has flaws, some of which are fairly aggravating, but when the game shines it truly shines.  It's a grind to learn the factions at first, but if you have some friends to play with, you'll find few RTS titles with more intense battles or more interesting factions.  Worth five bucks, easy.

												Earth 2160 is a somewhat unappreciated RTS with a number of nice features mixed in with a truckload of bland. It will provide some decent entertainment in the here and now but it will never be remembered for anything.Earth 2160 sets you in the future, corporations fight for control over the Solar System's dwindling resources as a new discovery rocks the power structure and sets the game's events in motion. As you start out you get to play as either a generic male dominated corporation or the curiously female dominated Mars corporation. They both, not surprisingly, turn out to be evil rather quickly into the campaign and you eventually get to play as the ""good"" faction, a generic robot corporation that really has no personality and eventually, a menacing alien horde.The storyline really isn't anything to write home about, it's all pretty standard stuff, good guys works for the bad corporation but eventually rebels against them. The dialog and cut scenes are of a particularly low quality that will often make you cringe at just how awful it really is. Where Earth 2160 gains a points is in the gameplay however, each faction has a unique set of units and a unique way of base construction, the Mars women for example focusing on individual strong point structures that can have additional modules added on top for research, defense or unit production whereas the alien horde have no real base construction instead focusing entirely on cloning and evolving their units.And as if this uniqueness to each faction wasn't enough each faction come with a complete research tree and the ability to customize each unit with various types of weapons, shields and engines allowing you to really make the faction your own. This customization does have it's flaws however, particularly where single-player is concerned as the AI does not adapt to your unit builds it is fairly trivial to make an exact counter to what the AI is building and just stomp them using rock-paper-scissors.The slight RPG elements wherein you occasionally have a hero unit or two that can pick up items feels somewhat misplaced and rarely add anything beyond something to worry about as losing a hero often leads to a game over.Earth 2160 is not a bad game and it's a game you can get a lot of fun out of especially if you skip past the cut scenes. it is however not a game that will stand the test of time and as such it's not really something I'd recommend anyone buys any longer.

												I've played the old 2150 series (Escape from the Blue Planet, Moon Project & Lost Souls) and I really wanted to like this new part of the earth series ... Sadly that's not really possible.Maybe I'm overly nostalgic from what earth 2150 has and 2160 hasn't but even as a fan of RTS games this game feels very halfhearted.1) The Unit EditorThis is why the Earth series felt so unique: Build your own army, by picking a chassis, add weapons & shields and voila. Earth 2160 even added a few extra features. Now you can add engines, armour as well as gimmicks such as auto repair drones. In the old Earth games, shields kept you alive deflecting plasma or electro canon fire. Now armour is way more important than shields as most weapons simply bypass shields. What sounds like a great feature simply turns the game into a game of rock, paper, sicssors, lizard, spock. Either your army wipes the floor with your enemies or they get crushed within seconds. Reload, build units using other armour and try again. Once you get to the enemy base, the game really starts showing you the middle finger. Almost all weapons have reduced damage against buildings and if you don't want to get shreaded by basic defense turrets you'll need artillery units to slowly tear the base down bit by bit. Remember how much more fun it was to have your army charge in and blow up buildings? I do -.-2) No Mainbase / Veteran unitsRemember when you could do research between missions at your mainbase? Now you'll have to do all your research during missions. It helps that each research center you build no longer gives a timebonus, but instead allows simultanious research yet in the end you're just waiting for new chassis to unlock. Very boring.Veteran units you can take from mission to mission can no longer be picked by you, instead the game apparently randomly chooses units from previous missions as starting units. Granted, each unit now has a pilot who earns the XP and can be placed in another vehicle, but it's just not the same. 3) Hero UnitsI loved ""Fang"" from the previous games, so I was curious how this one would play out. Fang was pretty OP, but not as OP as the new hero units in earth, that can take out armies without breaking a sweat. Not to mention the horrible dialogues and voice acting. No idea why the games doesn't pause during dialogues *or* why I can't control units during this blah blah *or* why everyone wants to talk during attacks. 4) Bugs bugs bugsI was stuck on a mission because I've taken a different path to my objective, not triggering a dialogue. Still not as fun as  watching my units drive right next to the enemy before opening fire or simply not attacking at all despite ""follow enemy"" settings and being under heavy fire.

												This game sucks. Its rules are opaque - you have no idea what individual units can do, what the benefits of specific buildings are, why you can't even BUILD some of them (research center I'm looking at you). This is IN SPITE of a fairly long pdf rulebook. The controls are crude, oafish, clumsy, the units can't be trusted alone. The music gets in the way and the voice acting is hokey. I got up to the One Against All mission upon which I battered my head for days, unable to hit on any combination of tactics because I HAD NO IDEA WHAT MY UNITS OR THE ENEMY UNITS COULD DO. When I gave up and tried to load a new game and play a different faction, well guess frigging what - it won't ALLOW you to play any other faction unless and untill you've finished the sucksbigtime Dynasty missions. The game looked promising and I looked fondly at the original one - but this one? a mess			",18,3,0,4,1,0,7

												Those who like the 'Earth 2150' they will also like the 'Earth 2160' too. You can customize you units arsenal, and you can play four completely different factions. The story is continuing, the game sticks to its style. Good things: 	-You can pause the time and while give the orders. 	-You can customize your units arsenal. 	-You can jump forward in the time, and if some trouble happening the time jumping it will stop.Bad things: 	-Rarely the effect and voice sounds not loaded. Just reload game. 	-Sometimes when you playing the numbers keys wrong working. Just reload game. 	-In skirmish mod 'Hard' and Expert difficult the AI is cheating. They always build their units and rebuild buildings without collegians resources. I recommend this game those who have played 'Earth 2150' and you like it.			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

Clearly labeled, and easy to use. I was able to quit the game and uninstall it much more quickly than I was able to with 2140.If you love the franchise, you already know you'll like it.(so go enjoy it) If you know nothing about it, maybe that's a good thing.(and you should keep it that way)			",95,12,4,3,4,0,4

												No. I did try, but the interface is so clumsy! Very painful to just set up your units who simply die in one second each.This game suffers from the same problems games like Red Alert have. The AI knows what you field, and they know where you are, or how your base is defended, so they will constantly produce counter-units to your's and attack you where your base isn't defended.Is there even a plot to the campaign? Maybe there is, I admit I didn't play a lot into it.If you enjoy games like Red Alert, Earth 2160 is a cost-efficient deal to try out. As for myself, I can't play these.			",112,11,0,30,7,0,22

												While this game reminds me of games such as Warcraft, and Starcraft it has not aged nearly as well as those games have (if it ever had anything to begin with that is.), partially do to the fact that you must jump through hoops to even access the game content by having you write down, and repeat multiple codes, and forking over your personal information such as your Home Address, Phone Number, and Real Name, I can see where this might be a protection against piracy, however it hurts those who bought the game more then it does the pirates who might stoop so low as to illegally download a game as useless as this.aside from that the games graphics, and story is mediocre at best, and far from original, I'd recommend downloading one of the Starcraft, or Warcraft game titles if your looking for a great classic with origianl, and gripping content ",80,19,1,17,8,1,2

												After the destruction of the EARTH in 2150, the leaders of the Eurasian Dynasty escaped on board an evacuation fleet. Now they are fighting for the survival of the human species. Their base is one large building comprising of smaller variable parts. The Lunar Corporation is already on the Red Planet and has to fight to find a new base and home after the destruction of the Earth. LC buildings are built one on top of the other, similar to a skyscraper, but with one big difference - they have the ability to defy all the laws of gravity to move quickly to a new location. The UCS (United Civilized States) machines evolved from the UCS battle machines. During the long flight to Mars, the computer decided to kill all human survivors and then initiated a plan to conquer the solar system with its own mechanical army. The Aliens - alien renegades were imprisoned a long ago, deep in the unknown history of Mars. In 2160 the landing of the UCS ships awoke them from their long sleep...			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												When I first saw this game i was very interested because i LOVE RTS, so i got it when steam sale it for a dollar. At first it was pretty cool but then i was very disappointed by the game.since other people have already complained about the invassive registry process, so i will not go over it.I first tried the campaign, but i counldn't even bother to finish it because it was so boring.  It was just a regular skirmish mode with some limiltations and cutsceens. there are few mission where i controll a single unit and do stuffs.....but they are pretty boring as well.The factions in games are also miss repressentive, i mean the ED stands for Euroasian dynasty, so you prolly excpecting Russian and/or Chinese together right? But no, appearently they are American.  The voice acting are horrible it would have been better if they just showed us texts, the voice actors are just reading the script without acting. They didn't even bother to fake an accent.  The units voice are also horriducily act.Plus there are a lot of bugs in the game that make you don't want to play, for example if you have a fighter engage in air to air combat against a group of gunships, the fighter would get stuck on the other gunship nearby when it strafe the target. The fighter can't be moved unless the gunship that it stuck to is destroyed. Tank  skim side way instead of turning.  Then the unit itself are so unbalanced, one shot kills are common, i understand the devs trying to make us mix units and make different type of armor and custmoze my army, but it just too much when you have a gunship with sheild at full health with armor good against laser to be one shoted by anti air that fire missile.The path finding in this game are also terrible, veichles all clogged up when in tight area which make them unable to move, this is especially irritating in the campaign because it has a lot of narrow pathway. infantry would dance around the edge of the clif instead of finding a way to go around it, have to manually guide them. They also tend to""stack"" onto each other making it almost impossbile to select them indivusially.Graphic wise the game was ok for it's time, the explosion is pretty nice looking and the day/night cycle lighting are very good.The animations are horrible most unit don't even have any other animation beside move stop when they die they just have a huge eplosion and dissappeared, when infantry die they fall like they are in a 3d max testing animation so unnatural,  ground control 2 was released in 2004 and it has far better animation than this game.But since i got this game for a dollar i didn't losing anything, You can give the game a try but don't expect much.

												WARNINGthe game wants your personal info (adress full name postal etc.) in order to give all campaigns and MP...read about it B4 u buy it.<UPDATE>I finished the first (ED) campaign, and decided to put some info into that ""registration"" form bull'sfecies...I'm playing through LC camp. now.The game itself isn't bad. Has some fun ideas, mini RPG system for heros (who you can't get killed or mission fails). I like the armour types vs damage types (rockPAPERscisors like). The energy shield doesn't work like in other games, it's only vs energy weapons... hence the name: energy shield ;PSo imagine my suprise when my uber,3000 shield pts. tanks got wasted in a matter of seconds vs enemy tanks when I put the wrong armour on them... :|			",34,1,0,8,6,0,22

												It is bugged unplayable and the difficult just makes you play a mission for 10minutes like 4 hours because emeny makes you dye fast and recharge is taking just very long.. i stopped until i finished ED and tried LC..alien are overpowered and you just spend 1-2hours mkaing effort in useless battling for an underpowered LC..i regret i did rebuy the game after losing my DVD i bought when this game was released..search google to find all the problems you will experience its not the players..its the game its unbalanced gameplay..its unbearable long play making style..the darkness 2 took me similar lengh like i played here for 1 campain nd getting in the second one..but i played it 2 times one easy go and one hardcore walkthrough was enjoying...IT ISNT ENJOYING MAKING A GAME HARD AS HELL WITH A UNBEARABLE GAMEPLAY! EVEN BACK IN 2006 THERE WERE FAR BETTER GAMES LIKE ""ACT OF WAR DIRECT ACTION"" WHICH WHERE PLAYABLE AND HARDCORE!!If i would be you i wouldnt try this game you just get regretting it even if it is indeed with ncie story it doesnt make the terrible game good enough to play even 12 hours to be so frustated like i was when i was a kid not nothing what to do..

												Absolutely disgusting. I bought the game. It brings me to a page with irritating music (no mute button, mind you) and asks me for A PRODUCT KEY. I bought it through steam. And it wants a product key.Steam gave me the product key, of course, but I BOUGHT THE GAME THROUGH STEAM.It then demands 'to access full features (sound like premium mode to you?), you must register.' Already pretty put off, I click 'register via internet.' It asks for my name, first and last. Age. Gender. CITY AND HOME ADDRESS.""After successful registration, we will send you an email with instructions on how to download your missing content.""I bought a game. But I didn't GET a game. I got a ♥♥♥♥ing freemium piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I'm sending in a ticket to return it. This is an absolute SCAM, and stay FAR away from it.			",58,5,0,19,8,0,26

												""Hey guys, let's throw out half of previous games awesome stuff - that awesome multi-map simultaneous mission command, make gameplay so boring that there is special button which completely skips time until something happens, add godawful heroes, and try to ripoff warcraft 3 hero system with custom items, maybe add rpg-like inventory but do it as crappy as possbile. Oh and throw in awful music, and especially awful one for main menu theme"" < sounds about right. Earth 2160 throws series back to the same pit of crap they crawled off while they were transitioning from 2140 to 2150. Don't get me wrong, tunneling system aside - 2150 weren't anything special either, really. It basically completely ripped off warzone 2100 just like 2140 ripped off c&c. But it had playability and some interesting hooks. This game does not. Sad.			",277,54,1,22,66,2,56

												I tried to get into this game, especially because it was 69 cents when I bought it... but first off it makes you basically fill out an online application just to register the product to be able to play it, as if paying for it wasn't enough?  Total fail.  Then I played the demo for a few because I wasn't going to sell my soul for a game I already bought to get the ""full features unlocked.""  It was pretty bad honestly, putting aside the older graphics because I'm sure they were okay for its time it was still bad, I had three vehicles taken out by 4 basic infantry and that's when I quit.  The building system was pretty horrible too, had to build single square connectors to put my base all together, making it like one huge lump that there was barely a way around.  Yep all in all I can't say I would ever reccomend this game to anyone, even at 69 cents I just want my money back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First Impressions: I'm sure I got this from an indie bundle, because I would almost never purchase a strategy on purpose. To get ""the full experience"" the game has DRM that requires you to manually type in a 16 character Key, enter your name, address, and pc info, then write down and track some access code. Fun start. Presentation is kinda cruddy, though, it's an older game, so I don't expect the best graphics, but older games did a better job with what they had in my opinion (intro video to ED campaign looks fake, talking characters are just jabbering their mouths in animation). Pathfinding is non-existant - instead of the AI finding the best path in a mountainous valley, you have to manually click them through the path. My ""hero"" died after the first group of enemies after I earned a squad, then my team was massacared by the next. I'm sure I'm just ""playing it wrong"". I may give this game another chance in the future, but considering I don't play strategies much, I'm more likely to look for a better game in the first place.			",965,265,43,131,97,11,157
