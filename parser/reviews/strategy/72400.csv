												Very simple game that brings back a lot of memories of the original lemmings. For just $1 at the moment (as part of a groupees bundle) its good value for money and just the sort of mindless fun you sometimes need. The mouse control seemed like a good idea but to be honest activating the special clones via the keys is so much easier. The interface is simple and clean and once you get the hang of the different clones its a good way to while away time.Can get a little annoying on some levels when the exit point doesn't beam your guys up (Sometimes the detection is a bit off) but there is a nice tutorial for every level in case you get stuck which shows you how you should do it.

												Easily the best game i've ever created :)I really enjoyed the 2-player mode of Lemmings for the SNES growing up.  Years later when i started LAN gaming i wanted to relive that gameplay but sadly discovered that there was no networked (or even modern) version available - so i decided to create one and convinced a friend to help.Clones is our tribute to the Lemmings-style, with modern features like leaderboards, map editor, various gamemodes, team multiplayer, and co-op for singleplayer puzzles.  Multiple checkpoints can be set so you can explore different solutions to the puzzles without having to do parts of the level over again.  I prefer the the multiplayer for the strategy and quick thinking - just like the old days! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a lot of people already said, this is a Lemmings clone. A VERY good Lemmings clone (maybe calling the game ""Clones"" was a joke in itself? I'd love the developers if that was the explanation.), which has multiplayer too, so you can virtually get an infinite bundle of enjoyment out of it.The general look of the game is a little more cold and sterile than good ol' Lemmings, but it's not that bad! Clones make it up a bit with their cuddly cuteness.If you are in search for some suicidal-critters nostalgia without having to deal with outdated graphics and outrageously low resolutions, then this game will be your cup of tea.

												Lemmings was always considered an absolute classic of a puzzle game, and this really does feel like a modern adaption of it!  It's got basically everything you'd want from a Lemmings game - control options, leaderboards, multiplayer, level editor. If you've liked Lemmings before, you should definitely get this.At the moment, it's only got a 71% approval rating, but judging by the (lack of) content in the negative reviews, I think it's really unfair.

												I reccomend only if you are a die-hard Lemmings fan.  IF you are new to the genre - treat yourself to something else.Clones is not bad, but it's made so tedious - simple things become stretched into hours lost doing nothing but repeatition in game.Not streamlined, not quite there, but good idea.  A bit more effort and polishing and this would have been a great title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played the original Lemmings games since I was a kid, and I was super happy about this game. Some of the later levels are somehow extremenly annoying and you (for some reason) cant even find help from the internet.Now don't get me wrong, the game is overall really great!

												If there's an update with ""overhauled UI"" dated after this post (2nd July 2016), it might be worth it. Otherwise, steer clear : the menus are hard to navigate, there are a million clickable things that aren't clickable, etc. Number on problem: the ""skills"" require you to target the CLONE first. (consider the basher from lemmings. Remember how hard it is to time the click right? Now imagine having to pick the lemming you want to use first, then finding the correct button for the bash, then get the timing right. If you get it wrong, you have to repeat from step one. All tools work this way, it's so frustrating, and there's a reason lemmings did it the other way.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It lives up to its name of being a Lemmings clone and does that in an amazing way. Firstly, don't be thrown off by the colors and such. Once you play and have a feel of the game, you feel more engaged, and it was honestly really surprising and fun when I played the first few missions. Secondly, the multiplayer is really fun! I like the way they added it to the game, makes it much more interesting and, at a few times, funny. In short, if you really want to go back to your childhood and relieve those Lemmings moments and play with some cute yet suicidal blob-creatures/""Clones"", then this game is a must-have for you!9.5/10 from me!

												I was expecting a crappy asset flip by the screenshots, but was pleasantly surprised that the game is a very compitent ""Lemmings"" clone. The interface isn't great, the voice over made me laugh, and the game overall looks very amature, but the core mechanics are definitely there.  I haven't played long enough to speak about how the difficulty curves out, but it seems like it has a ton of levels, and has a branching level structure that should help if you get hopelessly stuck on a level.P.S. For those of you born after 1990, lemmings is a puzzle game where you direct helpless little creatures in order to get them home safely. Later levels became very boring because the solution was often to build a bridge over some obstacle, but overall the game was good for it's time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
