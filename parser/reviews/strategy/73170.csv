												In this game, you can play as FDR, the well known imperialist who conquered South and Central America in the early 1930s, and went on to pre-emptively invade Japan. His famous speech on the day of the invasion will be remembered as ""No seriously, guys. I am a time traveller. Japan attacks us in late 1941. That's why I transferred the entire Army to the Marine Corps and based the entire US Navy in Guam."" The Belgian Prime Minister, when questioned about his decision to build a massive line of backwards fortifications on the French border facing into his own country answered ""The Germans don't actually stand much of a chance against the French and British in 1939 if the Maginot Line continues through Belgium."" The Swiss Prime Minister, when asked why he devoted his country's entire GDP to Nuclear research and nuked Berlin in 1944 famously stated ""♥♥♥♥ Hitler"". tl;dr Alternate History is great.

												With the 1.03 patch we have plenty of scenarios, including the 1945 one which is fun to play ! In my opinion Darkest Hour is better than HoI3 because is easier to learn and the UI is really friendly for new players . Unlike Hearts of Iron 3 you can have different aproaches on the game , based on your decisions , a communist Germany for example right from the beginnig of the 1933 scenario ! On the official forum you can find many mods which can extend the regular timeline of the game , for example New World Order 2 mod ( a Cold War Mod ) and Modern Day scenario mod ! Alternate history:Kaiserreich (What if Germany had won the First World War )                             Fatherland (What if Germany had won the Second World War )       All in all I really recommend Darkest Hour !

												I am going to be honest with you.This game has stolen many, many hours of my life. I have changed the course of History in an infinite number of ways, and have played most nations, from Germany to the USSR to Cuba to Portugal. It is the best 20th century (until 1950, anyway) grand strategy game in existence. It is far better than Hearts of Iron III.But what is just fantastic about this game is two things: the community and the mods.The community is one of the greatest, best bunch of history maniacs and armchair generals I have ever seen. Going to the forums is a rare and wonderful experience. And they are exceedingly nice. And they will advise you and help you. And they will discuss intricate, microscopic details of historical events with you. And you will learn. And you will like it. And you will make friends. A fantastic bunch of people.The mods, as if the game didn't have enough content already, are incredibly fun to play, and some are incredibly detailed as well. They are not that difficult to install, and you will have a ton of fun with them. I personnally recommend Kaiserreich (Germany wins WWI) and New World Order 2 (get to play during the Cold War as well, including alternative history events for a German victory in WWII). And, of course, the community has also dedicated itself to these mods, especially Kaiserreich.I have been playing strategy games since Civilization (the first one), and this is the best strategy game I have ever played. Period. If you like strategy games, it is a must own.			",73,11,2,10,39,0,38

												I was playing as the Nazi Germans, and was in the fight of my life against the soviet union, playing on Hard. My Army Group South's advance was stalling out, and I couldn't break the Soviet Defenses around Leningrad. Army Group north was closing in on moscow, but the feirce winter had my troops stuck in their tracks. Hoping to avoid Hitler's folly, I had build up winter equipment for my men prior to the invasion, but however these extra insulated uniforms and felt boots haven't done much to increase my chances of sucess. After just losing a key battle on my way towards Moscow I decided to pan down to North Africa. Here I had blitzed through the British Lines with my Italian allies, however it was becoming more apparent that we were going to be surrounded at the suez cannal. However I just had to hold the province long enough for my fleet of troop transports to go through the cannal and escape the mediteranian sea, where they would then drop reinforcements off in Somalia to bolster the failing Italian defensive lines. Then It happened. Out of no where the English navy blindly stubles into my fleet of unarmed troop transports and they sink every single one of them. Eight Divisons, a total of 104,000 Soldiers died at sea because of my blunder! I then saved my game and decided to pick it back up later. After just getting off the game, It hit me that I've been playing this amazing game for so long, and never publically voiced my opinion about it, so I decided I'd give this game and the developers, the credit it deserves. I have to say this is by hard my favorite grand strategy games of all time. The gameplay allows for endless possibilities such as alternate historical events and outcomes. The events triggered in the game catter to shaping a world that you desire. The game also has a plethora of many great Mods for it, such as ""The Grand Campaign"" which bridges the World War 1 Sencario with the World War II scenario, allowing you to start in the year 1914 and end in 1991. I've spent about 212 Hours playing this game on steam, however I've easily spent another 400 playing this game on Multiplayer via Game Ranger, which at the moment is the only way to play this game with your Friends, however it does not launch the game through steam. Not only will you being scultpting the world, but you also learn a great deal about history and geopraghy at the same time. This ultra realistic diplomacy, political, and war simulator will, Darkest Hour a Hearts of Iron game, will always hold a special place in my heart, and I do not think Hearts of Iron IV will even be able to top Darkest Hour. My Favorite Strategy Game ever! Totally worth the buy! If you have it and are discouraged, don't give up, once you learn how to play this game you can have so so so much endless fun with it!

												Darkest Hour is one of my favourite games, hands down. but why? I think I will list them in bullet points to make it simple-Compared to HOI III it is much less complex and much, much easier to follow-Graphically compared to HOI II it is a massive improvement. However, I also think that compared to HOI III it looks much better, but thats just my opinion, you should look at screenshots if graphics are important to you-I find the game to be Historically accurate, with interesting scenarios that can happen, caused by the player or sometimes not caused by the player at all. -The WWI senario also has an interesting amount of choices which no matter who you're playing as will have an interesting affect to the game as a whole, and are plausible-The WW2 scenario is pretty good though I always want to think of alternate events that can happen etc. etc. and there are certainly some missed oppertunities, but nothing major. -Mods, firstly the AAR mod, which gives the player an extended timeline from 1914 until 1964-Mod33 a French mod that gives new nations, new events, new units, new desicions, it is a very good mod, however the event text is in French, so it is also a way to practice your French-Modern Day scenario, a very good mod, as it says you get a modern day scenario, with all new techs, all new Units, and a load of new events, not to mention all new leaders, -And Finally Kaisrreich, firstly no 2 Kaiserreich games are the same, they always turn out different, in one the USA becomes Syndicalist (no communists), in another the Qing Empire re-unite China, in another game you might see an independent Siberia, chanes are you will see many of these in a single game, you might also see none-Kaiserreich is an extremely interesting scenario, the Central Powers win WW1 and you believe that scenario, in fact it is done so well, to the point where I remember someone on the forums saying ""I don't play Kaiserreich that often, but when I do, I forget real History""			",14,1,0,5,5,0,19

Also, at least half of my 1600+ hours in this game was spent with the mod Kaiserreich, which is based on the idea that the Germans won World War I, so check out the mods, there are a number of well-developed ones out there.

Posted: May 26, 2015
												I played many hours and many campaigns in HoI ages ago and enjoyed it. I hoped to enjoy DH: HoIG as well, but really couldn't.Why?1. The advantage of HoI was that you could do alternate history, changing the course of events, etc. DH pretty much forces you into a very pre-determined course. I tried playing as Yugoslavia, 1936 and in spite of beefing up an army, fortifying borders, doing my best to stay out of the coming war, having excellent relations with Germany, Italy, etc, come 1941, scripted ultimatum by Germany, your choices are ""become a puppet"" - game over or ""be invaded"" - game over. Tried playing as the Soviets, HoI gave you a choice ""do Stalin's purges, lose a third of your generals"" or ""don't do purges, see your dissent skyrocket"". DH gives you no choice, purges just happen, you lose a third of your generals AND your dissent skyrockets (weird actually, since the purges had a rather opposite effect, putting everyone in line with the dictator's commands). So, basically the player has very little freedom of action, outside of the developers vision of how a scenario should play out. This, to me, defeats the purpose of a sandbox grand strategy game...2. Bias or unbalance. I got a distinct feeling the game was very pro-Germany biased. I tried a 1933 Soviet scenario and tried to play a ""nice Stalin"" one that helps and liberates, rather than opresses. Got involved in the Spanish civil war, took over the troops, helped Republicans get a clean win. And the thanks for my effort? Minimal relations increase, no alliance, a puny 1% dissent decrease (but for changing a minister I ger a 2% dessent increase), no military experience, basically nothing. Got involved with the Chinese in fighting off the Japanese invasion, by inviting Commie China into an alliance. Automatically Nationalist China also becomes an ally. I soundly beat the Japs, annex Chinese territory which automatically transfers to (should at least ask me which China I wanna give it to) Nationalist China. Japan asks for peace giving all Chinese territory back and Korea and Pacific islands too. I accept, Nationalist China becomes huge, but both Chinas immediately break off the alliance with me and go into negative relations. I immediately liberate Korea, but my belligerence goes up. I get no option to liberate Pacific islands and am forced to give them to Korea if I don't want rebellions. I don't give any ultimatums or invade Finland, but they still hate my guts and try to assasinate my ministers. And French and British keep trying to assasinate my ministers. I don't accept Hitler's pact to divide Poland, but he still invades it, just instead of getting half of it, he gets all of it. My belligerence is still in its 70s just for helping liberate China without keeping a single province to myself, while German one after invading the entire Europe is in its 50s. I fortify my western border with bunkers, behind rivers, upgrade all my troops to latest level, research nothing but land tactics, beefing up my ground forces to latest standard of warfare, got 1941 tanks in 1939, good and skilled generals in command. No good. When the Nazi decides to invade, he's got at least 100 divisions more than me and in spite having lower organisational rating, still cuts through my lines like a hot knife through butter. Oh, and Lend-Lease. US sent over 20,000 tanks and airplanes to the Soviets. What does DH game give me? Not a single tank or plane, but 50 units of roads instead. 3. Airforce is entirely useless. When the Nazi invades, I got complete air dominance (his planes are likely over Britain). I pound an advancing column with my entire airforce of 4 Tactical bomber groups, 4 close-air-support groups and 12 fighter squadrons all in their latest 1941 upgrades. And all I kill is 400 enemy men out of 100,000, practically don't even scratch them. No organisational disruption. No advancement slow down. Nothing. All money spent on (expensive) airforce is completely wasted.4. Diplomacy. Pretty useless. Any alliances, non-aggression pacts, demanding territory, outside of scripted ones are practically impossible to achieve. 5. Intelligence. Pretty useless. Chances for any actions are so low and so expensive, that the money is utterly wasted on them and coups, sabotages, etc are practically impossible or if they happen they're definitely not worth the money in the minimal effect they have.I suppose the only way to have a chance is to invest everything in a thousand infantry divisions with artillery attachments and all the money into research boosts so you get blueprints for stuff every time. All the other features are useless and a waste of time. I'm a stubborn person, so I tried same scenarios several times, trying to make some optimal decisions to enable me to gain the upper hand, but the game just keeps blocking any progress I make by its punishing mechanics, limiting diplomacy and disruptive random events. Maybe I should just play as Germany and steamroll everyone.Verdict: Forced. Unbalanced. Biased. Frustrating. Unrewarding. Punishing. Irrational.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Darkest Hour differs from Arsenal of Democracy (2010), the other modded product of Hearts of Iron II (2005) in that it expands the total number of provinces and functions as a fully moddable core. While improving Hearts of Iron II, Darkest Hour also includes a number of historical scenarios ranging from Operation Overlord to The Great War (World War I). Although it lacks the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 or the 1948 Arab-Israeli War offered by Arsenal of Democracy, Darkest Hour provides one of the greatest user modifications ever made -- Kaiserreich.Available for download on the Paradox forums, the Kaiserreich mod follows the ""Legacy of the Weltkrieg."" In this scenario, Wilhelm II secured victory in the First World War causing the Allied Powers to fall into disarray, and rendering the Nazis and their rise to power null. Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States all experience turmoil and strife offering the player a large number of decisions -- the UK turns socialist, the US becomes fragmented... Mittelafrika is ruled by Hermann Göring... it's all very engaging.During my playthrough as Romania in both Arsenal of Democracy and Darkest Hour, Darkest Hour kept most historically accurate during the 1936 Road to War campaign. However it should be noted that Slovakia is formed almost always in Arsenal of Democracy.I highly recommend Darkest Hour to the armchair general sort of strategy fan. Its successor, Hearts of Iron III, is unfortunately bogged down with unnecessary complexity with an Order of Battle organizational structure that leaves users micromanaging at all times.

												This is THE BEST GAME EVER. Firstly, even excluding mods it covers: - WWI- WWII, including a two pre-war startdates- Beginings of Cold War/post WWII restructuring of the world stage.Second, the features are awesome. You can trade and claim land, determine your government type, install puppet nations, preform espionage, and found alliances. It has a boat-load of events and decisions, too. And they are not deterministic, the game is not a complete sandbox, but it has several alternative paths, nations, and events for several senarios.Best of all, its entirely moddable, and has some amazing mods. It has mods to improve each senario and even a killer mod to add in Cold War Senarios and events.And the best thing? Its still being worked on~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another great Paradox game. If you enjoy WW2 history and grand strategy this is the game to get. Although focused on WW2 originally, you can play from the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), WW1, WW2 and into the Cold War time period. It might come off as a bit complicated to begin with, but with a little effort its difficulty gives way to its constant replayability. A massive tech tree, tons of units, hundreds of historical events, this game is incredibly detailed, without being overly complicated. The UI can take a bit of time getting use to, but once you start playing, it comes naturally. For the price tag, this game is really worth it, as you can easily sink a lot more time into this game in terms of replayability (why not go Communist Germany in 1933 for a change?) than it costs.

												Darkest Hour is definitely a better HoI game than HoI3, despite its age. There's no unnecessarily complex OoB system that you'd need to graduate West Point to master, there aren't a billion shapeless provinces in sparsely populated areas, and although the map and UI are pretty dated they're comfy to use. In contrast to the dryness of HoI3 which has maybe half a dozen decisions solely for the purpose of railroading the AI into doing what it's supposed to do, DH has plenty of dynamic event chains, and it feels like you're really impacting the world. DH also has more of a sandboxy feel to it, with different outcomes every game, but in HoI3 once you've played each of the 3 factions you've more or less experienced it all. Then there's the timespan, with a grand campaign in DH potentially lasting from 1914-1964, 50 years, compared to 1936-1948, or 12 years, in HoI3. And last, but definitely not least, DH is tremendously easier to mod than HoI3, and so has a very active and skilled modding community. Which brings me to my last point:Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg. The amount of detail put into this alternate-history mod for Darkest Hour is pretty stunning, and is definitely a justification all on its own for buying the game. If you have even a slight interest in alt-history, you'd be doing yourself a huge favor by picking this up and installing KR.The base game is easily a 9/10, but Kaiserreich bumps that up to a 10/10.

I spent good bunch of hours making the ottomans great again, from Greece through Crimea and Suez all the way to India. Some play this game to win. I don't. I find this boring. I always take some minor country. My goal isn't a world conquest, it's to take as much as I can bite and then survive as long as I can. Of course I lost that Turkish campaign. But this game was so full of emotions. Especially because there is a counter that tells you how many manpower you've lost. You see this and think ""over a million people died to hold the line"". It surely brings a tear to my eye. Seeing my empire decline, with all the people dying one by one. At the end of the war there was no one left to reinforce my troops in the desperate defence of Anatolya. That's why I actually nominated this game for the “I'M NOT CRYING, THERE'S SOMETHING IN MY EYE” award.			",173,33,7,17,19,0,41

												Hearts of Iron 2 is the greatest WW2 grand strategy game to exist, period. This is a mod for that which makes that even shinier. Course this is a super-complex game that will scare people, but... nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? Also you can fight WW1 in this too.Also there are mods for this mod too, as quirky as that sounds. Some of them are quite good.Anyway, this is fun for strategy nerds and psychos like me.

												DON'T UNDERSTIMATE THIS GAME FOR BEING OLD or BEING BASED ON A OLDER HOI2 ENGINE!!!Seriously this game it's sooooo deep and good that will make you lose hours of your life into it.I know HOI3 or even HOI4 are out nowadays but this game adds lot's of different stuff and a very acurrate Historical scenarios.Also if you want the best experience Download THE GREAT CAMPAIGN MOD (TGC). it makes the time go from 1914 to 1991.... I can't begin to tell how much replayability that adds, especially because it's so well made that it has a bazilions of events and connect all the timeline together very historical and nicely(if you want).Seriously this game especially with TGC offers like 1000hours of gameplay... And for a very low price, if you are a Grand Strategy fan this is a must for you.Overall Score 10/10			",434,99,6,150,94,4,187

												For me, this is the best Hearts of Iron experience. I enjoy playing with Darkest Hour Light mod which adds more options to the orginal gameplay, but doesn't change it too much. I would recommend buying this over the original, since this inclued also the orginal game (as you have option to play without mods) and the easy to use launcher lets you select higher resolutions for modern systems (instead of the old 1024x768 fullscreen).Word of warning to Win8 users though. You need to play around with settings-file and play in windowed mode, because the full screen mode is not working properly (poor fps and sometimes mouse cursor missing).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderfully crafted game. It is much more flexible than HOI3, and it is less overwhelming since there aren't as many provinces. The base game has many opportunities to change history- you could do a German invasion of England (but I actually used paratroopers to get a beachfront ;) ) and set up a puppet state, or you could annex it outright. The World War I scenario is also a neat feature that the other games don't have by default. The mods for this game are wonderful, and someday I'd like to make one myself. I'm not what you'd call a master at this game, but it sure is a lot of fun!			",2,1,0,0,1,0,1

Posted: February 4, 2016
												Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game was my first foray into the world of Grand Strategy games. Unlike many other games, where you can pick up and play immediately, this title required a little study on my part. The in-game tutorials give some of the basic concepts, but fail to connect the dots between the various resources, province improvements, economic impacts, decision points, and WAR. It also fails to provide the dizzying array of factors that go into waging war on the land, sea, and in the air. Thankfully, the manual more than makes up for this bare bones set of tutorials, and browsing a few popular steam forum posts regarding getting started can fill in the few missing details that the exhaustive, and lengthy, game manual fails to provide. All told, I had at least 4 miserable attempts at cranking up my German war machine and 3 hours of studying the manual and online material from other players before the game actually clicked. But once it did I found the experience to be more rewarding then any other strategy game I have played. Planning is key in Darkest Hour and the game will punish you for trying to switch horses in mid-race. You wanted to invade Africa with your newly formed Afrika Corps under Rommel? Too bad, you have been gearing up for an airborne invasion of England and neglected to station a fleet in the Mediterranean, and now the Brits have closed the sea to you with strong garrisons at Gibraltar, but think ahead next time. You have been throwing back the fascist surge into your Soviet Motherland and now you wish to strike at the heart of Berlin, but oh no! Your aircraft are being chewed up by a powerful Luftwaffe and the edge of your armored spear is blunted by withering ground fire that starves your leading troops of supplies, should have planned for better AA or better aircraft to take on the advanced German machines, but you foolishly invested extremely heavily into tanks alone. You are playing as France and your doom lurks to the East, but you masterfully united your country by focusing on monetary gains and consumer goods while spending lavishly on decisions that lowered your dissent and strengthened your economic base, while simultaenously extending the Maginot line like a family of beavers on cocaine, maybe this time Fritz will not have such an easy stroll through Belgium into the north coast. These are only a tiny fraction of the possible ways to lose or win in Darkest Hour, and I will not even get into the actual warfighting, as 50 pages of manual only starts to do it justice. If you are crazy over 20th century history (yes WWI and one of the greatest mods of all time ""Kaiserreich"" is available in this game), you often ponder or discuss the blunders of Imperial Japan and the Wehrmacht, or you just love the thought of Stuka's pouncing on your broken and retreating foes to inflict additional casualties, this is the game for you!!! Unlike Civ V or some other strategy games, this one is about WAR. Playing peacefully is sometimes possible as a smaller nation, but play as a major power. That is how the game is meant to be enjoyed. Watch your Reich grow, or spread freedom to the enslaved peoples of the globe as the USA. But remember, if you wish for peace. prepare for WAR!			",66,14,0,8,11,0,22

												Darkest Hour is the best WW2 game published by Paradox so far, and with its selection of mods makes it a fun and entertaining game for fans of the Grand Strategy Genre. The Base game offers an experience that makes you feel like you are conducting total warfare on a grandscale, and offers both Historical and Proposed plans and events (For example, the British plan to invade Scandivavia, Plan R 4, can be conducted by the UK and at the penalty of upsetting relations with the USA and other free countries, you can eleminate the German war-machine's steel and oil resources from Scandiavia.)However, it is important to note that this game was made back when Paradox was in a more niche market and did not feel the need to modernize or streamline their games. As such, newer players of the Grand Strategy genre may be put off by the look of the game, IC system, and minute details. It would be wise to look at the tutorials and read a guide about Darkest Hour before one tries to plunge into the game. Additionally, the game is more on rails than HOI4, so you won't see anything crazy happen like the USA undergoing a communist revolution or Britain allying itself to Germany. Additionally the game does not technically run from steam so there is no steam overlay while playing the game.When it comes to mods however, this is where Darkest Hour gets most of its replayablilty from. Mods such as ""Kaiserreich"" radically changes the entire game and provide an entirely new feel and experience for the player. ""Fallout Doomsday"" is another mod that changes the game into a Fallout strategy game. Additionally, there are mods for increasing the difficallty of the AI and making the game more historically accurate or providing what-if scenarios (Such as a Communist Germany in the 30's).Ultimately an essential game for Grand Strategy players and fans of WW2 if you are willing to get over the somewhat outdated UI. The game earns a 8/10 for its fun factor, replay value, mod support, and the fact its the most historically accurate Hearts of Iron game made so far.			",87,11,0,15,23,0,34

												If you like HOI2 (or HOI3 in my case), then you would probably enjoy this. You don't have to hassle with finding mods and unlike some mods which either go forward or backwards in time, this does both. You can play from 1914-1964 all in a HOI style game (no having to convert other games).

												Remember Hearts of Iron II? To me, it was far superior than HOI3 (haven't played HOI4). Darkest Hour is a fan made expansion that is the ultimate HOI2 experience. Darkest Hour is a grand strategy world war II experience where you play from 1933 through the end of the war as nearly every nation. There is also a good world war I scenario.Each major nation (USSR, Germany, UK, France, USA, Japan, etc) has events and decisions that will allow you to follow a historical path, or make alternate history choices. Units are on the division/air wing level, with individual ships being modeled (small ships like destroyers and submarines are grouped into flottillas) you have full control over the technological research and unit production of your nation. You can build whatever units you want in endless combination. Want to invade the UK with a huge army of paratroopers? You can do it. Want to crush the Russians with strategic bombing? Worth a try.The game also has an extensive modding scene, from alternate history (Kaiserreich - what would happen had Germany won WW1) to increased difficulty (World in Flames mod) to historical realism / flavor (Total Realism Project).I have hundreds of hours in game and it is still one of my go-tos if I get the grand strategy craving. Great value for $10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have dedicated 400 hours of my life to this game and I have loved every hour of it. Great game for strategists and it educates you on World War II, the Great War, and the Cold War. The tech tree is really cool and if you play after World War II ends you have the opportunity to research supersonic aircraft, ICBMs, Air Cavalry, etc. Darkest Hour is much better than current HOI games because of its complexity. If a HOI game is simple then it is not good enough. This game provides an in depth experience. Although the game is complex and therefore requires hours of gameplay before you get any good, it is still the best strategy game on steam hands down. This is grand strategy at its finest! 10/10			",15,0,0,2,8,0,19

												Darkest Hour may be based on 2005 Hearts of Iron 2 engine, and comes with its limited possibilities, but some improvements (like the newly introduced deicions) and great mods - Kaiserreich, Fallout Mod, Between the Wars, WiF, and others make it an interesting choice.Kaiserreich and Fallout mods are the best ones in my opinion. Hearts of Iron 3 with BICE might provide a superior experience of WW2 than Darkest Hour with its WW2 mods, but the setting of those two is nothing short of amazing. Kaiserreich depicts a world in which Germany won the Great War, both France and UK succumbed to left-wing radicalism, US is on the verge of another Civil War, and you are able to customize your state like in no other HoI game. No two playthroughs are the same and extreme amount of new events make this mod probably the most immersive of them all.Fallout mod provides great setting from a great game. If you are a fan, it's so much fun to fight the Enclave as the NCR, uniting the world with Master's Army, looking for tech with the Brotherhood of Steel, rebuilding the Empire as the Kaiser's Legion or playing some of the other, unique nations - both known from Fallout games like Hub, Klamath, Reno, as well as unique ones like the Robot Nation, Former USA or Dark Cathedral.I realize that this review is all about mods, but those are really what makes this game worth a shot. Overall it is slightly improved HoI 2, but its mods are what made it outstanding and why I still play it while not really playing HoI 4 at all.			",70,60,7,45,108,1,58

												This is a fantastic game. I have about 2000 hours in it, and I don't at all feel like I wasted that time. It's a bit old and clunky, but if you're willing to look past that, mod it a bit and learn the mechanics, it's well worth it. It's a bit less complex than Hearts of Iron 3, but I feel like that's more of a perk than anything. This is a strategy game, not a logistics simulator. Order of Battle and supply lines are not as important as your plans and your armies.If I had to say one bad thing about this game, it's that it has a pretty poor domestic focus. Food is not simulated at all, and anything that doesn't contribute  to your war effort is lumped into the non-descript ""consumer goods"" category. Diplomacy is also a bit weak. Without an event or a specially coded AI tick, the AI is highly unlikely to agree to anything you suggest. War really is the best way to solve anything, and that's fine. The game accells at war. It is a bit frustrating that the belligerance mechanic punishes you for going to war, when it's often the only way to progess, but it would seem weird to leave it out, so that gets a pass.But for the love of god, do not play vanilla. It's fine. Vanilla Darkest Hour is a very good, enjoyable game. But you're seriously missing out by not playing Kaiserreich, Boneparte Legasy, New World Order, Fatherland and the mirad of other awesome mods you can get on the Paradox Plaza fourms. It's worth the small headace of installing.			",199,18,2,18,33,0,41

												Even this many years later, with Hearts of Iron III and IV being out, this is still the best Hearts of Iron experience out there.I've mostly played Darkest Hour with the Kaiserreich mod for its alternative World War II, but either way the number of tweaks and features between this and basic Hearts of Iron II make it a huge improvement on the experience that has yet to be topped.

												Thought that this lasted from the beginning of WWI to 1964, the standard ending of HoI2. Unfortunately, the WWI campaign originally ends in 1920 or 1942 based on settings. Regarding that, it was a huge disappointment as I planned using one of the minor European countries and making it a huge force before the beginning of WWII. Apart from that, WWI campaign seems decent. If you didn't like HoI3 just like me, this can be a good option for you until HoI4 comes.			",231,58,10,24,37,2,59

												I think Darkest Hour is much better than HOI2, especially in its real, complete and detailed map. I love ""Patch 1.04."" I usually play Japan. It's more historical for East Asia now not only in more historical events but also in more historical map. Thank you so much. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ ❤* I love Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game! It's the best WWII game! \(^o<)YA			",1043,454,37,176,157,18,243

												Get it cheap and enjoy (I got it for 2 dollars and have seen it that price several times since). It is well balanced and the AI is more fun than regular HoI2 Armaggeddon. I enjoy it as a few of the AI nations develop their own nukes and seem to make smart naval invasions that force me to preemptively defend coastlines.			",23,4,0,2,9,0,13

												This is the best Hearts of Iron game on the Paradox Interactive's original Europa engine. This game is a result of a collaborative effort between PI and HOI modders, and it implements the best aspects of HOI2, adding much more, making it one of the most stable and mod-friendly Europa-engine games.The only reason many people even play this game still has to do with mods, such as ""All In One"" mod pack or the Kaiserreich mod, as well as many others.I give this game 8/10. It is perfect with mods but even the original DH version is a fun experience, especially if you were left disappointed by HOI3 or HOI4. I have found that DH is much more easily customizable, versatile and moddable game than other HOI titles, making it a perfect WWII grand strategy game. Its only flaws are an outdaded Engine, which have to be tweaked to run properly on newer systems, and also that one has to get into modding in order to get the most from this game.

												My favorite from HOI series -Simple but lot of depth after almost 200hours of gameplay still think there is much to learn.-Might be hard for first time player but just keep playing :D-Mods so many of them  like fallout, new world order 2 kaisserich and many more. -For 10€ there is lot to play here check it out if your strategy game fan-So many starting points for your own save as any country you want in that time periot.But i need to be honest this game is not perfect (cons) -Biggest con is that this game crashes specially in (Win8) not all the time but like example leavingmultiplayer match game usually crahes there -Some weird bugs sometimes in multiplayer more, not so much in singleplayer-in Win8 this game has weird fps problem it never goes over 30 fps for some reason there are some fixes in internet, that said thought its not problem for me atleast because you actually dont need more thand 30fps to play this because there isnt much things happening on map also all the animations etc work just fine with 30fps.Overall great grand strategy game, my favourite :P			",57,1,1,5,4,1,10

												This game never gets old, I love the new HOI but it just doesn't have this charm. This isn't overly complicated like other Paradox games. You could pick it up anytime, whehter you're new to straegy games or not, and have an awesome time. First time I played this I played as China during WW1, first real HOI game I had. I sucked, like a lot, but learned so much. It was amazing.This game is worth every penny, and I still come back to it after all this time. That's why it derserves the ""TEST OF TIME"" award in my opinion. It's just one of those games that I'll never give up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some games have the ability to inspire the player to read books, watch documentaries and truly indulge in the subject the game is exploring. This is one of them.While I'm not watching 'WW2 in colour' to supplement my gaming experience I'm currently 30 hours or so into a UK play through.The interface may look cumbersome but I've found it fairly simple after an hour or so. I'm finding the small tactical changes I'm adopting are making a difference. Finding a balance between historical events and your own style is very rewarding. D-Day approaches!

												No matter how many HoI series Paradox releases, this is the best of all that has come from their games. This game wasn't made with big bucks or buy a multi-national company. This is the product of very dedicated modders and enthusiasts of the series and of WW2 as a whole. My tribute goes out to them for making such a great game, with hundreds of mini mods available for it. Overall, yes, yes, yes. Buy this game if you truly wish to see the world and play as one of the super powers during 1936. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great, not to mention  the Kaiser Reich mod which although not historically accurate (not meant tobe) is awsome. The gameplay is very good and worth the 10 bucks and deffinatly worth it same gameplay style as HOI3 but better in my opinion. Rewrite your history as you want it, if you can manage it take over the world as Louxembourg(forgive my spelling if it is not correct), or as any other nation you want Germany, USA, UK, France, or Russia just naming some Major Powers. Fight WW1, WW2 and control the fate of the world during some of the cold war (not sure how far it goes havent gotten that far in it yet). Change history and invent the Atomic bomb as Morrocco (if you can manage that which would be extremely hard I'd say).			",99,3,2,10,35,0,61

I do have a couple of gripes - the game seems to crash on occasion (so be sure to set the autosave feature to monthly)Also, the AI seems more interested in grabbing territory rather than strategy. It will often send units to capture territories, even it it means them being cut of and eliminated with ease.Overall 8/10 - Will be conqured again.			",8,0,1,2,9,0,11

												Even outdated this is one the bes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥estest games ever if you don't mind sitting around idle pondering and organizing.The base game has campaigns in WW1 and WW2 where you can lead any country on earth pretty much,even like Tannu Tuva(based tannu tuva)or Nepal.Unfortunately by default the interwar period is not interesting,there is a mod called the grand campaign which supposedly fixes it but I've never really got it to work properly which is a shame.Which gets me to the real greatness of this game:the modding community!!There are so many great mods that will allow you to play in all these different time frames and scenarios with the same polish and fun of the base game pretty much.There are mods that improve the base campaign(total realism,world in flames,mod33,etc)mods that are set in other time periods(modern day scenario,new world order 2(cold war),even napoleonic wars)and mods that COMPLETELY CHANGE THE TIMELINE into a ahistorical one which are my favourites like Kaiserreich(germany wins ww1)abd even a mod that let's you play in the wastelands of the fallout universe!!The only problem is the game is really showing it's age and doesn't work great on new OSs and the engine doesn't allow for much more to be done with it than it already has,so we are just left to hope hearts of iron 4 improves on boring overcomplicated soulless hearts of iron 3,which doesn't involve you into the experience of leading a ♥♥♥♥ing war one single bit in my opinion.

												This game is awesome and the Kaiserreich mod is even better. This is a classic grand strategy game. Command your armies and aim to become to most powerful nation on earth. The game has realistic features like having to decide where to use you industrial capacity, from upgrading your army, to supplying them, to producing new units and factories, and to creating commercial goods to supply you citizens and make your wealth. Another realistic feauture is after moving your troops long distances their organization will be low and they will be not effective in combat. Also the game iis very cheap and the Kaiserreich mod I mentioned earlier is free. Overall it is a great game and I think all strategy lovers should get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Base game offers an experience that makes you feel like you are conducting total warfare on a grandscale, and offers both Historical and Proposed plans and events (For example, the British plan to invade Scandivavia, Plan R 4, can be conducted by the UK and at the penalty of upsetting relations with the USA and other free countries, you can eleminate the German war-machine's steel and oil resources from Scandiavia.)However, it is important to note that this game was made back when Paradox was in a more niche market and did not feel the need to modernize or streamline their games. As such, newer players of the Grand Strategy genre may be put off by the look of the game, IC system, and minute details. It would be wise to look at the tutorials and read a guide about Darkest Hour before one tries to plunge into the game. Additionally, the game is more on rails than HOI4, so you won't see anything crazy happen like the USA undergoing a communist revolution or Britain allying itself to Germany. Additionally the game does not technically run from steam so there is no steam overlay while playing the game.When it comes to mods however, this is where Darkest Hour gets most of its replayablilty from. Mods such as ""Kaiserreich"" radically changes the entire game and provide an entirely new feel and experience for the player. ""Fallout Doomsday"" is another mod that changes the game into a Fallout strategy game. Additionally, there are mods for increasing the difficallty of the AI and making the game more historically accurate or providing what-if scenarios (Such as a Communist Germany in the 30's).Ultimately an essential game for Grand Strategy players and fans of WW2 if you are willing to get over the somewhat outdated UI. The game earns a 8/10 for its fun factor, replay value, mod support, and the fact its the most historically accurate Hearts of Iron game made so far.READ MORE  Was this review helpful?

												Very good game on all three parts of it, yes three parts, there is the original game then two other mods for it, they dont do much except change the layout, i would personally go with Darkest hour full. Depending on your nation, which you chose, you have to sort of keep to the limits of what you can get. If i was the russians i would have to be a bit behind on technology as they dont have the best tech teams. If i was Germany then i would be ahead of the curve. The entire game has set events such as the start of WW2 and the end. Depending what nation you are you will have to either follow them, make your own, or do nothing. If i was germany, i could start war with poland in 1933, or attack the west and ally myself with the russians etc. In Short, know your history. 11/10 would be mien fuher again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you ever wondered what would have happened ...If the United States entered the Great war on the side of the Central Powers If The British Empire joined the axis in its war against CommunismIf the Japanese won at Midway and the Coral Sea if Italy managed to take full control of the MediteranianIf the Soviet Union launched an full scale attack on the Western powers in 1945 If Nazi Germany had developed the ICBM and the Nuclear bomb Then I seriously recomend this game its timeframe expands from the death of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 to the failed Bay of Pigs in 1962. Durring this period you can play as any nation on the planet from the superpowers of the time such as UK and Germany ( includes all Germanys durring this period Imperial, Wiemar, Nazi, Allied ocuppied to East and West) to the smalest nations on the planet. The game's unique Grand Stratagy will be complex at first it is easy to pick up. ",63,6,0,2,16,0,21

												A very strategical game, in which the Hearts of Iron UI has been taken one step further. More complex, more sufisticated and more challenging. If you into CIV, HoI kind of games, this is definitely a mod for you. The UI and gameplay in itself is more text based and needs thorough understanding and study. It is not a game which is easy to understand, but that is not what we expect, is it? Really looking forward to HoI4 next year! If it is enywhere close to EU4, it will be a thrill!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Darkest Hour is an outstanding grand strategy game. You can play one of scores of countries during the world wars and the first couple decades of the cold war. Internal politics, espionage, research, and military affairs will require your attention as you lead your people to victory (whether in terms of hoisting your flag over Berlin or accomplishing what if goals that you set for yourself). Unlike Hearts of Iron 3 it is approachable by mortal men, boasts lots of historical flavor, and is well worth the asking price.I can’t recommend this enough. Darkest Hour is clearly the best of the Sim Stalin series. ",380,53,11,47,48,1,97

												This might be the best grand strategy ever.Very deep political gameplay and a complex military system makes this game incredibly inticing.Drooling graphics fans will not find much here but for those interested in history and politics on a high level there is most certainly a great game here.The engine is ridiculously moddable and brings us everything between simple taxes and investment mods to enormous interwar and cold-war mods, both from the community and by the developers themselves.There is plenty of alternate history scenarios.Play as a major power and win world war II as a communist Germany allied with the USSR.Play as a minor power and align yourself with one of the blocs as a usually neutral country such as Sweden or Switzerland.Rush to develop air and armor in WWI or rush to develop rockets and nukes in WWII.Great gameplay.Great replayability.Graphics could be better but for ♥♥♥♥s sake, if that's a dealbreaker for anyone they can go shove it.

												The quintessential WWII strategy game, Darkest Hour is one of my favourite games, period.Despite being relatively old, at least by game industry standards, Darkest Hour is my go-to WWII strategy game, thanks to its balanced mechanics, fun yet challenging gameplay, and populous modding community.I would reccommend buying this over HOI3 mainly due to the fact that it is much more rounded out - while HOI3 is much more in-depth in terms of military, every other aspect doesn't measure up.

												Well , that's good for 2011 ! I love it ;) .Why ? First , is old , but you can do everythings from 1914-1920 (Great War) or from 1933-1948 (World War II) .Second , modding , is soo far good (bad english ?) , add techtree , unit , weapon (pretty the same because unit need weapon) , and change the time line , ehhh , yes but hard , but , you can change the end year ! Like i play Japan from 1933 , breaktrough the entire India and east , and can finish in 1970 , and other Third , is a good strategic game , you do micromanagement (a little bit hard) , manage your oil , metal , rare ores , energy ,  ...  , and the make that quite good but hard .Thy only bad point , i think , is the cheated AI and the old graphics (the two things is the same , mechanics of game) But , is a good game, i hope you love strategic games , just go listen a littlebit of gameplay , tutos , and other for the beginning ;DNote : 18/20Good time everyone ! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't mind the playtime, I've played a lot more of this game before I bought it through steam.Take the Hearts of Iron series and streamline mechanics and interface and you essentially haveDarkest Hour. Due to this it has less complex features, especially in the political system and ininternational relations. But from it still having the spirit of the games, it is still quite fun.If you are looking for a deep war game, this might not be it, but mods like Kaiserreich and NWO2 make it tons more enjoyable.

												It's pretty much the most in-depth WW2 strategy game ever conceived of. Manage diplomacy, production, upgrades, reinforcements, technological advancement, military deployments and fight the biggest war in history.To be completely 100% honest the game is mostly a Germany Curbstomps The Earth simulator. The game is challenging and enjoyable with clear goals defineable by you or the nation you choose. Basically, Germany can choose NOT to start the war. Or it can do so much earlier. However there's a mostly 99% chance that as other countries, war will visit you in a semi-historical fashion. As USA you will be attacked by Japan in 1940-1941, and as any country but Germany there's no chance that the Germans WON'T invade.As fun as this game is, I feel like it's seriously limiting sometimes. I've played the game for 800 hours and I still don't understand all the mechanics, but that's my fault (and let's face it, a hopelessly convoluted Naval Model for the ship combat doesn't help either). The limitations set in when you try to completely alter history. The game is designed to facilitate historical outcomes until the war starts; as a result Germany is stronger than Poland when things go down, and the Germans will have success in France and maybe even the UK. However Germany AI never really does well against the Russians, and usually by 1942 you're dealing with Communist France.The entire game is basically designed to be played by one of the major belligerents. If you choose to play as a minor territorial expansion and leapfrogging to greatness is possible, but extremely difficult and time-consuming. Leading Cuba to conquer the Central Americas took 20+ years. The game starts in 1936, and my first invasion kicked off sometime in the late 40's.The game is extremely complex and is basically an OCD person's worst nightmare. You'll spend hours just organizing and planning offensives before they even begin, and keeping it all organized as you advance is the real challenge. It's too easy to forget about a unit you sent that way only to read they were encircled and destroyed; the scale is such that you can suffer serious information overload.Also, lots and LOTS of info. Constantly being relayed to the player. I recommend this game but with a HUGE caveat:- If you're not super into the strategies and tactics of maneuvering armies in WW2, but are more interested in the small scale, I suggest other games. The entirety of this game is played through a map of the world. Units are represented in terms of 15,000 men instead of squads of 4 like in some RTS games set in this period. - If you don't like micromanagement, then avoid this game. Micromanagement is part and parcel of the experience.- If you don't have patience then I'd avoid it as well. This is a game with a learning curve that is more or less a straight cliff. You absolutely MUST read the manual and play the game multiple times before you can understand how to play well. My first game as Germany, the Polish occupied Berlin. It's also a very time-consuming game. I call 5-6 days of continuous play a ""quick playthrough"" - games can often last upwards of weeks or even months. This is the best WW2 Grand Strategy game available, but it's also not very user friendly. Those without the patience to learn how to play should avoid this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is simply one of the best Hearts of Iron Games, it is very moddable, has a great replayability(Who wouldn't want to try your hand at winning WW1 as Germany, or surviving WW1 as Russian Empire?). It is a simple game, that has lots of historical events, which might also teach you something. There is quite a lot of mods, so everyone can find something. You want Cold war? No problem, just find the mod on the forums! The community is very alive, and the game is updated from time to time, with big updates. It also has no technical issues, at least there isn't any major ones.Overall, it is a great game, that is worth the 10 euro's price, although it is on sale for 2 or 1 euros at the times.

												A really great game with lots of opportunities to re-write history. It's really in depth with lots of management and research to take into account, but the replayability is endless. I always enjoy when my soviet armies storm into the German heartland and I topple the fascist pigs regime. It's something to get if you're into grand strategy games.			",76,25,0,38,13,0,29

												I wanted it to be easy so I picked the Soviet Union, the first thing I did was invade Romania, apparently Russia did the exact same thing, I think it's kind of a testament to the accuracy of the simulation. You just can't possibly resist invading Romania, your troops are massed there, it's the only possible decision. I conquered about half of Romania and fought off the Nazis until I ran out of steam. I didn't know how to make new troops, and then I got bored and stopped playing. But it is certainly fun and interesting, I look forward to learning the mechanics a little better and trying again.

												Hands down the most refined historical WWII simulator on the market. The ""vanilla"" darkest hour is amazing but I've heard mods can take it to the next level. Don't let the clunky UI full you. It's quite functional once you know where everything is located and you can automate almost anything (eg. trade, promotions, leader assignment).

												I am seeing that many (including me) are complaining about Hearts of Iron 4. This is not a suprise to me when I think about what Paradox have accomplished in the past with Hearts of Iron 3 and Hearts of Iron 2. I strongly suggest Paradox to look back and see what they accomplished. Perhaps they should also look at userremakes like Darkest Hour since this one is a great improvement of the already fantastic Hearts of Iron 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although quite daunting at first (I didn't even touch the game after my first attempt for a few weeks), Darkest Hour proves to be an extraordinary stratedy game. You have the ability to play as any nation you can imagine, from New Zealand to Liberia, and take reign as the world plummets into chaos. There is a learning curve, however, as one would have to spend a few dozen hours playing as different nations just to fail and play again adapting to the previous mistake. I think that this is what makes Darkest Hour a great game, it's unforgiving and refuses to hold your hand, something that has become a rarity with most modern video games.			",25,4,0,3,2,0,3

												Very good at simulating the world between World War 1 and The Cold War. You can play as almost any country like America, Britian Russia or the small countrys such as Frace Ititly or Holland and everything in between. You can try to improve relations with allies or, just ya know be a war morngler that nobody likes. You can make peace deals or attack be a techoglnical center and build screat wepoans. If you like war histroy or stragity games this is the big one for you			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy: Does not work/unsupported.This is a Paragon turn based strategy game set in WW2 Europe.  Unfortunately, while the game was published in 2011 and updated up until 2015, support for modern PCs was never applied - overscan/DPI issues make the game fail to render properly on monitors with higher resolution than HD. However, as they are keen to leave their hand out for people to give them money for this on Steam, even knowing it doesn't work on modern PCs, I am forced to leave my hand out too - with a downwards thumb.

												Dont know what to write, so I will write a recipie for pancakes.ingredients100g plain flour2 eggs300ml semi-skimmed milk1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable, plus extra for fryingpinch saltMethodBlending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.Flipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.

												If you have an AMD graphics card avoid this game like the plague.If you want to actually play the game without crashing upon startup you need to disable unit sprites, country specific graphics, and run the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode if you have Windows 8 or 10. If you follow these steps the game will work, it will just look terrible even for a game where graphics are not important. All the unit icons are replaced with a simple X that makes your armies even more of a cluster♥♥♥♥ to manage.Apparently the issue is AMD driver related. So alternatively you can rollback your drivers a few years if you don't care about playing any other games. Maybe then the game will actually work correctly.Despite supposively being the best Hearts Of Iron experience, my experience has been the game repeatedly crashing upon startup then spending half an hour trying to fix it just to find out I would have to play without any real graphics once I went to the forums. AMD and the developers are aware of the driver problem but are either unwilling or unable to fix it. You can still play the game without these sprites and graphics but the lack of them makes managing your armies more difficult which ruins the game for me.I'm not too mad since I only got this game for $2.50 once it was on sale. The only reason I am not refunding it is that I might be able to properly play it in the future on a computer that does not have an AMD graphics card. Until the driver problem is fixed I do not recommend this game for anyone with an AMD graphics card.			",72,15,0,25,20,0,42

												Do not buy if you are running on windows 8 or 8.1! It doesn't run on these versions of windows! Take your money elsewhere!Just think of how horrible it must be, in 2015, to download a game off of Steam of all places - to then have it not run properly simply because your using 8.1, you'll have lost £8.00.It's not a bad game, but to have it not play on the most recent windows operating system is revolting, and to think some poor sod is going to lose their money because they haven't been informed before their purchase by the seller.

												Game doesn't work on Windows 7 64-bit with an AMD GPU.I checked for fixes, but the only reasonable one I found didn't work. It makes my monitor go 70s with magneta & cyan colors when I start the game.If I disable unit sprites I can get into the main menu, but whenever I try to start a scenario it still goes 70s.The other fixes involved moving around dll files & editing the registry. You should never have to do such things to play a game, it's current year +1, not 1970.			",177,18,2,28,31,0,52

A re-install does nothing - same exact problems. No support is provided on the Steam forums. My ""58 minutes"" of playtime is me trying to get the game to a working loading screen.To use EU4 parlance, I would not trust this game to die properly.

												Literally the worst strategy game I have ever seen bearing Paradox's name. The original HOI's are way better than this piece of you-know-what-i-mean.In the name of 'loyalty to history' DH force history down your throat.  However hard you try, even if winning the battles of impossible, they will make all your effort void using their 'historical' events.Take 1914 Republic of China for example, dissent +5% events pops up about bi-monthly pre-civil-war, and the minute civil war starts, they take away every single general you have, leaving literally no one to command your troops for you.  You would think that should make it hard enough?  Not even close!  The best part is, you losing or winning the battles against revolutionaries does not even matter, at all!  Even if you disband all you troops, just sit and watch revolutionaries occupying your territory, they will stop at south Yangzi River anyway.  What if you manage to slowly turn the table, beating them and drive them into sea?  Same.  The war will suddently stop by the exact same event and you will handover more than just taken-backs to the revolutionaries.  Oh wait, there is actually a difference, any troop you left on the suddently surrendered territories will just be gone for good.  So the best way to pass through the silly event chain for that period is actually pull all your armies far from revolutionaries and wait them be stopped by the event of destiny.  Yeah, that's the best thing you can do, seriously.Don't even try, just let history reveal itself.You call it strategy game, I see it visual novel.  Not even a good one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is difficult to learn. The tutorial is not helpful in the least. I could go on in length about the good parts and the many bad parts of this game, but I can sum it up very quickly. You can micromange 100's of things. You can do so much in this game. There is diplomancy, combat, strategy, etc. However this game does not do any of the well. This game is not entertaining or enjoyable. I am a vertan if strategy games stemming from the Command and Conqure series as well as Age of Empires and Civilization. With Age and Civ, a lot of things are generalized. With Darkest hour, everything is too granular. I bought this game because I wanted a very granular strategy game experiance. While it technically provides that, it does not go it in a manageable, learnable, or enjoyable game. Unless the HoI series of games is the only thing you have been playing over the last 10 years or you are a developer for the HoI series, this game will likely not be enjoyable for you. Unless you are willing to read the entire manual about 3 times over and watch many hours of online tutorial, walkthrough and gameplay, and you are wanting a strategy game this have absolutly no instant gratification, then this game might be for you.

												Absolute garbage. Doesn't run until you downgrade to a one year old video driver (AMD).When it does, you have to run it in low resolution so that the text is theoretically big enough to read. You still can't read it though, because unless you're on a very old screen (lower dpi), it won't render correctly. I can't read it. At all.DO NOT BUY!			",34,6,1,6,15,0,18

												In the interest of full disclosure, I have not PLAYED this game at all.  Here's why:I purchased this game during the holiday sale (Dec 22nd)  for $1.99 and I think I got ripped off.  As far as I can see, I need to register the game with Paradox.  I created an account and attempted to verify with the link provided in a return email.  The link lands on a ""This page does not exist"" error.  The email includes a second link ""In case"" the first link doesn't work!  It does the same thing.  The email thirdly includes a ""Contact an Administrator"" link which sends an email to same which just got me an automated response.  It's been just over two weeks, and I have yet to receive any other response from them.  Taking into account the holidays I'm extremely disappointed.  I indicated that I had uninstalled the game and would considered it to be a complete fail on their part.  If someone from Paradox actually reads this (which I highly doubt), feel free to cotact me via Steam.			",37,10,0,11,9,0,9

												Darkest Hour is a very good game, if you have the will to learn quite a bit, initially, seeing as this isn't exactly a Total War game, or even Risk. (Although, it does have components of each of those in it) This game involves a lot of learning through trial-and-failure to begin with, but once you get the hang of the basics, like managing your economy, technological development, as well as unit production - but, once you do figure it all out, it's a very good game, and all the time you've sunk into it does become quite rewarding. (Especially say, if you attempt and succeed at taking over Europe as Poland, for example!)			",231,38,10,53,38,2,64

												Wow, this game only cost 20 USD and yet, I have had more enjoyment out of it than most of my games on steam, this is Darkest hour. Darkest hour is a Political/Military simulator, spanning from as early as 1914 to the 60's. You can pick any nation you want, ever wanted to see france defeat the german Blitz * Although this is extremely difficult.* ? And say you don't enjoy playing the nation you currently are, but you don't want to start a new game? You can just load up the scenario and pick a new one! In Darkest hour, you research tech, and try to maintain your nation. There really is no "" Victory"" in Darkest hour , its only what you want to achieve. Also, since this is a paradox game, the community is great for Darkest hour. There are tons of mods, Like Kaiserreich, Fallout mod, Modern day, etc. I myself usually like to play kaiserreich, where its a ""What if"" Scenario of Germany winning ww1, and the world is drastically diffirent.  For example, in one of my games I played as the Qing Empire. After amassing enough forces, I started to conquer my neighbors in order to re-unify China. But then, I had a major war * I won* in which I had to throw germany out of Central china and Indo China. So what are you waiting for? GET THE GAME SKRUB			",141,6,1,12,10,0,29

												Yet another Hearts of Iron 2 Spin-Off, though the best I have played so far.You can choose from a variety of scenarios, for example the 1914 scenario and the 1933 scenario. Also all of the former ""titles"" are included in this.The old manpower-system has been replaced by a Conscription and Mobilization system. Also there are more provinces included, as well as some changes to the units. The new system also has its flaws, but I think it is a good change.In general you have to say that this game increases the depth of Hearts of Iron 2, while keeping distance to the overpacked Hearts of Iron 3. This is how HoI 3 should have been.So, to sum it up. You did not like HoI 3 and want a game, which is closer related to the greatest of Hearts of Iron games? Then you can go for this game without any remorse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I ever played. Focused on historical accuracy and detail rather than graphics.The complex game system requires time to get used to, but guarantees long singleplayer fun and challange.You can battle the enemy by air, sea or ground and develop a number of tactics to beat them.Provinces can be fortified or improved but this takes time. Overall the game is very balanced.You achieve victory by using the right tactics rather than with numbers.Personally I would recommend this game to every player who loves Strategy and World War II games.

Thrown in some very handy features like claiming territory, decisions, etc, and you have what is probably to pinnacle of what can be acheived with the Europa engine, upon which HoI2 is based.And with a 100% compatible and up-to-date Kaiserreich mod out there, you can't go wrong.I pick Darkest Hour over Hearts of Iron 3 anyday.

												Anyone who has spent any time in the Paradox Universe generally knows what they're getting into, so I'll try to keep this short. This fan-created spinoff on one the most popular EU/HoI time frames is truly spectacular. It's level of depth is enough to engage the most hardcore simfan, yet accessible enough to catch at least a wandering glare from passersby. At the risk of getting in trouble, I'd recommend buying this game, then uninstalling it from Steam, and reinstalling it from it's mother directory. The proliferation of mod material (strangely unavailable in the Steam community last time I checked) only serves to enhance this games playability.			",24,5,1,11,19,0,26

												If you are a fan of the multitude of Paradox Interactive titles, from Europa Universalis to other Hearts of Iron titles, then this is for you. New players may be daunted by the steep learning curve, but it is a game to stick through if you enjoy grand strategy, where you get total and complete control of your nation during WW1, WW2, and the Cold War.And with the easy support for mods, it really adds longevity to this game. Anything from extended playtime, alternate history mods, and even a Fallout mod!If you are a fan of the classic Hearts of Iron 2, then this game will be familiar. But it adds fixes, and an extended time-period, and updated map, and better unit graphics. A shoutout to Doomday's Fallout mod and Kaiserreich - the mod where Germany won WW1!			",38,4,0,15,11,1,55

Even without them however it is an extraordinary game as youd see by my hours of play, although thats not counting the time when i brought it direct from paradox on my old computer so its probably near to 1000 hours of gameplay, Ive played all the latest ones including HOI4 and they just dont live up to DH.

												This game deserves better reviews than the ""11/10 would [insert stupid joke here] again"" nonsense.Most reviews assume that you have played Hearts of Iron II before.  I never have, so jumping into this game was one of the most daunting things I've ever done when playing a video game.  Seriously, I've taken college courses that were easier than learning how to play Darkest Hour.  There's a ton of things to understand if you're going to be successful.  If you think I'm exaggerating, get this: the manual is 158 PAGES LONG.  On top of that, there are not many Let's Play videos of Darkest Hour on YouTube, and there are even fewer good ones.  There are not many people on the forum, but the few people there are very helpful.In short, learning this game as a newbie is going to be a steep uphill battle.  This game will punish you for forgetting to click a certain button or set a certain slider.  There are tons of little details and the interface is pretty hard to navigate.HOWEVER, this game is like a dream come true for someone like me, who has always loved reading about the 20th century and has always wondered what would have happened if Germany won WWI, if Japan attacked the Soviet Union instead of the United States, if Spain joined the Axis and attacked Gibraltar, etc.  The complexity of this game makes all the potential outcomes much more plausible, and therefore more entertaining.  And there's nothing like looking through the divisions you're commanding and finding the one your grandfather served in.tl;dr: this game is HARD.  Learning it will take many hours.  I'm not even close to mastering this game.  However, it's well worth the effort.  Winning a multiplayer match on any of your shooters isn't nearly as satisfying as winning a hard fought war and changing the world.			",54,7,0,15,15,0,10

												Like any game of Paradox that is based on it's more older engines, it has a learning curve. My main reasons for recommending this game: Mods Kaiserreich : http://cs.servegame.com/kaiserreich/. They even have their own forum, although they also have the mod on the paradox forum, but you can't see that unless you register the game. Anyway, apart from the Kaisserreich mods there is an enormous variety of excellent mods that far outstrips any other WW II game that Paradox or other developers have produced. This game has excellent moddability. Strategy The strategy in this game is excellent, although the economy side is a little underdeveloped compared to Arsenal of Democracy. The strategy in this game with the available missions on land, air and sea far outstrips anything other games can represent.  AI The AI is competent, the AI will destroy you if you don't follow your plan. If you deviate too often from your set plan the AI will absolutely destroy you since they are competent at doing the missions. The ability to control your puppets or the smaller countries in your alliance makes up for any incompetence they might present. The expeditionary forces ability gives you the ability to help your ally in need without the hassle of controlling them yourselves. Tech teams The number of tech teams is based on your Industrial Capacity, this means the more IC the more tech teams. The tech teams are a better alternative than the HOI3 model of just leadership points. The techteams have certain areas where they are competent in and the level determines how good they are. This means that some nations have an edge in some areas of research.			",71,7,0,12,13,0,23

												This is a must have game for anyone that enjoys playing strategic simulators based on the 20th century. It's basically a revamped Hearts of Iron 2 but it is very well done. Plus there is many mods from the Paradox Interactive Forums that allow a lot of scenarios and replayability such as Kaiserreich or New World Order. If you like the Fallout universe, then there is a mod that allows that. This game gets a 5 out of 5 here.			",17,7,0,3,9,0,15

												At the time of me writing this, I have played only one out of twelve of the game's scenarios for about 68 hours, and I am still not bored yet. If you enjoy running amok in the midst of wars, changing the tides for the losing side in their favor, or sealing the fate of them, then I would suggest this game, a great strategy game with little to worry about.

												This game, in every single aspect, is a masterpiece. I've logged many hours into this game, and I must say it was time well spent. I've played as almost every country, in every situation. I can be a democratic and peaceful nation when I want, or switch to Germany and be a fascist warmongerer. It is a far better game than HOI 2, or even 3. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes history, strategy, or war. It is well worth the $10! Good luck playing it!			",23,4,0,5,3,0,3

												I swear to god playing older paradox games gets harder and harder. Darkest Hour is what it's name implies. A Grand Strategy game that tests your ability to lead a nation in peril or in greater times during certain scenarios like WWI, The great depression, WWII and post WWII. I only have 40 minutes into the game but someday I know I'll come back playing this game for another good 40 minutes just to know what the hell is actually going on. I keep telling myself that I'll figure out how to actually play this game and I already have with CKII and EUIV and I'm damn proud of myself that I did I wish my friends would sit and give grand strategy a try but all they play is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MOBAS and LoL and I just can't stand the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Here I'am off topic... *sigh* give this game an alcoholic shot I know I did.
