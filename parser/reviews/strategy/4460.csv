												This is really a tough review to write, because I really like a lot of what is going on here.  But ultimately I just never found it engaging on the level of, say, SimCity.  This has an awesome street view version that lets you walk around and actually FEEL like part of the city, and if you like that sort of thing then this game is definitely one you can have some fun with in that fashion.In terms of the choices on how to build the city, it all feels a lot more abstract than SimCity, because of the way that there are these social groups and so on.If you're looking for an entry into the city simulation genre, then probably SimCity 4 (despite its awkward controls by modern standards) is the way to go.  If you're into citybuilders as a genre and are looking for another good one after having exhausted others, I can definitely tell you that I had fun with this one despite my gripes.  But it's not one that held my attention for dozens of hours.I was really on the fence as to whether to give this a positive or negative review.  Ultimately I felt like I had fun and got my money's worth, though, so that's the main criteria that I guess I should use.  The developer should be able to do better, and I hope they get a chance.  I'd like to see this evolve in future sequels, but so far it was already fun for what it is.			",338,76,9,38,50,4,55

												This game was fun for awhile, but ultimatly it got boring. Theres always people complaining when you upgrade your city, but if you downgrade it, there's no way to get the population up. Factions that get close to each other fight, and they end up burning down a portion of the city, they make crime go up, or they destroy the economy. Essentially you can work up to a certain point, and the entire city will fail before you can expand further.Another point to make, is that the business's in the game don't have any bonus's added to them, so the best way to run a city is to find the smallest building, and pack them together, because doing that will give absolutely no negative effects. I'd definitly reccommend this if you want a simplistic city simulator, but I greatly prefer Tropico 4 over this. The only fault with tropico is that the road system is absolutely terrible, and the only way to fix traffic is to redesign your city to situate the traffic better.			",341,60,5,34,28,2,37

												A really interesting game. It puts a unique twist on city builders by having what they call ""subcultures"". They're arranged in a hexagon, with the higher up ones being richer than the ones below. Those touching eachother on the hexagon are friendly, and those opposite are enemies. For example, the blue collars hate the yuppies and vice versa, the elites hate the blue collars, and most of the rich classes hate the poorest class. The key is that a fully fucntioning city needs people of every class. Someone has to be the janitors and grounds keepers. Artsy Fartsy people need doctors and firemen, and Executives need waiters at their restaraunts. People will not commute to the other side of the city for a job, so you need to manage where housing gets placed for each subculture. It's definetly worth looking at if you want a unique twist on a city builder.			",404,52,5,38,67,5,111

												Much like Cities XL, this too is another Sim City knock off. However, with the current SimCity game sucking balls, I recommend trying this game out as well. It is a little more detailed than Cities XL.			",54,15,0,20,27,1,29

												This game for its pricing and age is absolutely amazing truthfully! There is a little lag in between games which is expected on Windows 8.1 running a game that was from 2008. Once you get understanding on the business to housing down and benefit the needs of all of your people, it works out great! I would suggest just reading over the tutorial that is there and testing out things slowly, adding a house here, then a business there and watching your money as you do so before diving head first into adding lots of houses and businesses.

												2 hours and done.  im ok with that but its just not enough facing all the other similar games.  i know i will never play it again because (1) you know exactly how all the City sim games are going to play (2) the nuances of this game is akin to taking a sports game and forcing you to deeply manage the vendor supply chain - you just dont want to go there when the city build aspects for me are the draw...  no regrets to purchasing but wont ever go back.

												When I first read about it, the concept sounded really interesting - new layers to city building that were different than Sim City, which I will lose myself in for hours.  But when it actually came to playing it, the system was broken and the game itself was so glitchy and sticky that I just gave up on it.  Juggling faction territory was a pain, balancing upgrades with population mood was a pain, and basically trying to do anything was a huge pain.  There is such thing as challenging and fun, but this was just challenging.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Try Banished instead.			",50,24,0,5,12,0,7

												I played this game 7 years ago when it first came out, and I got addicted to it quite quickly. I never knew it was on steam, because I didn't come there until 2011. I was searching the steam store and I found that this game was available for purchase. I'd say this is a game to play to anyone interested in this type of genre.			",52,1,0,6,16,2,20

												Fun, and with some interesting concepts. I really like the idea of social classes occupying residential areas, being able to build per social class services, and different social classes not tolerating each other (meaning you may want to avoid mixing them up).But this implementation of these ideas is very buggy -- it freezes up way too often just to display a bunch of errors on my screen. It also does not tolerate alttabbing (this is on 64bit Windows 8.1 and NVidia GTX 770). And I may be missing something, but I can't see autosave happening.This means I've started off a couple of times already, but don't have any savegame to speak of.I'd say you may want to try it out, but bugs mean I found it too painful to actually play the game -- especially in face of competition.

												I could probably get away with saying the games management, you can place down a house then a business, you can plan out city areas very well, but it has it's deficiencies, i get a lag when i zoom in, it's not a good feature, the helicopters that aren't simulated, not very well done.Probably getting lag issues cause i'm on windows 7, but sim city is better than this already, and we all know the disaster with Sim City not enough space and all that. Cities Skylines is still better at the moment for city building, but of course this game was released in 2008. I didn't expect much to be honest.			",71,4,1,4,28,0,23

												There does not appear to be a random map generator, and you're limited to a tiny corner of the map at the start of each game.These factors alone are sufficient to make it inferior to the first three SimCity games (Though it is likely still not as bad as SimCity 4 or SimCity 5).Also the camera controls are extremely wonky.Other than that it's pretty clever and good.In summary, by todays standards it's absolutely great (much better than CIties: Skylines or SimCity 5) but today's standards are VERY VERY low.
