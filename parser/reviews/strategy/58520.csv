												You will lose. repeatedly. the other team will slip past your perfectly organized defenseyour defenders will get knocked out somehowyou'll fumble the ball when it's right in front of your player you will miss a throw, fail a block, lose players and watch everything you've so carefully organized be pummeled to gibs.But you'll get better.the more you play it, the more you'll understand the rules and how the nature of the game works.you'll have that moment where a perfect play comes together, or you see an opening in the enemy team's defense and just go for it. And when you do score that touchdown? It feels great. It's a difficult system to master and I'm sure as hell not there yet either. But from what I played on the 360 version and this, it can definately feel really rewarding when you nail it. And even if you don't? You can at least make your opponent have to work for it.

												Recommended for anyone looking to get a start with playing Blood Bowl. Blood Bowl 2 has come out however the editions of BB1 are great value since they have more teams available and BB1 still follows the same rule set.As for the gameplay, its essentially a combination of football, chess, and dice rolls. Many things do come down to random chance, but the goal is to ensure that you take chances in your favour to give yourself the best possible chance of success. Eventually all your players will die, you will lose the ball in the most random/unpredictable way and you with hang your head. No the dice are not stacked against you, and your not going to win every game. If you cant handle that than this isnt the game for you.			",70,27,1,10,26,3,30

												""WELCOME, SPORTS FANS! ARE YOU READY FOR ANOTHER SKULL-SPLITTING, BONE-CRUSHING GOOD TIME?""Ah, what fun it is to play the good ol' Blood Bowl! I used to play the tabletop version and fell in love. This version has all the charm (and frustration) of American football gone medieval, the best strategies lain waste to bad dice rolls, and multiple races with all the expected strengths and weakness common with Warhammer fantasy. The upgraded commentary from our two favorite Blood Bowl aficionados, Jim (Vampire) and Bob (Ogre), keep a smile on your face with every result... even the ones that go against you. The rulebook is also included from the tabletop version to define everything you need to know about the game.I prefer playing the turn-based ""Blitz"" mode, which allows for some customization of your teams, players, and adds additional flavor of spells, crowds and riot-causing fans, as well as player equipment (upgraded helmets, pads, etc which add to your abilities), bribing the ref, and many more. I love to win and hate to lose because this game make you sweat for every inch of the Pitch (playing field)!For the first time player, tutorials are included. The game is easy to learn but does have some complexion in the variety of rules to be tracked. I recommend to put it on easy mode and play a couple games to get the hang of it after you do the tutorials.Multiplayer mode is also available and I use it! My friends who play with me love to rant and rave about the worst roll or that last second catch at the end of the match that scored the game-winning touchdown! WARNING! This game will test your frustration limits! I mean, COME ON!, how does a strength 2 halfling charge a strength 6 minotaur and KO him!?? WTH, man!? LOL!Again, I loved it back in the 80's when I originally played it tabletop, and this brings back all the fun! It did so well that it received a go at ""Blood Bowl 2""!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												American Football meets Warhammer is probably the best way to describe Cyanide Studio's sporting epic called Blood Bowl which throws gamers into this deadly universe. Apart from sporting and a healthy dose of violence, there is even some RPG and management aspects added to the game to keep things quite original and fresh. Throwing together a variety of characters from the world of Warhammer, gamers can now experience a sporting game with a difference as Orcs, Humans, Goblins and the like all fight for victory on the field and although these games were quite popular in the yesteryear of gaming, it's great to see a developer run with the idea again.In terms of gameplay, Blood Bowl Legendary Edition is not your traditional sports game but you’ve probably guessed that already. As opposed to the console sport games, this title is a turn based strategy. The biggest change to this edition as opposed to previous games is that the developers have included a variety of new races into the mix such as High Elves and the Undead. Elves can also ""glamour"" their foes which does allow you to control them. The secret is 11 new playable races! Then you have the streamlined online play that actually makes it more fun to play it online as opposed to single-player. The only issues with online is trying to find another player and with offline, the AI is a little less than challenging.If you haven’t played the board game or the previous  PC game, I thoroughly recommend that you follow every step of the tutorial because as opposed to American Football, there are quite a few tweaks and changes to be found. From kicks to tackles and dodging, the learning curve of this title, especially if you are unfamiliar with American Football or rugby to an extent is quite high. Things become even more challenging with the inclusion of Blood Bowl rules.Once you have completed the tutorial, the story mode is probably the best place to start which allows you to put your skills into action…slowly. In this mode, you play a mercenary trainer or ""coach"" for your selected race,as you play a variety of games. Another fun mode is the campaign mode which offers you a plethora of levels or games to play but offers some unlockable content as you gain new powers and players.However the star of the title is playing the game online as you engage in a variety of matches and leagues. There is a new commissioner tool that has been added into the game. This gives the owner of a particular league, some power in terms of resetting matches or replays. This is how Blood Bowl should be played. Just be warned that dying sucks...  especially when one of your stars decided to take a dirt nap from getting killed by an opponent or opponent. Or those pesky vampires that get blood lust and wish to feed on not only their opponents but also the fans!Despite some flaky matchmaking and an apparent ability for less scrupulous players to 'predict' incoming dice rolls, online play in Blood Bowl is still a whole lot of fun. Custom leagues exist for those of you that want to dodge the minefield of random play, with a thriving community dedicated to providing decent opposition and eradicating the sort of rage-quitting and general idiocy that unfortunately rears its head during regular play with strangers. Also it's worth noting that due to the hugely expanded roster the Legendary Edition remains very much open to questions of imbalance, but in part that's simply a design choice. Choosing a smaller team such as the Halflings will never give you a fair crack at winning, but including the weaker races will placate a large section of the audience that wants an authentic experience and a distinct challenge for veterans. Yes it's disappointing to see a bewildering lack of instruction to new players on how to avoid the more obvious mismatches, but you get the feeling that developer Cyanide rarely took their eyes off developing a title that served the old guard first and foremost - the type of people that will be only too happy to have a large range of playable races and head into every game fully prepared for the likely challenge of encountering each. The graphics mirror the board game perfectly and all the characters look like their real-world miniature painted figures. The animation is good as are the stadium backgrounds and special effects. It’s funny seeing these mythical creatures compete in a sport game similar to American Football with its all regalia. The stadiums look pretty cool as well and there around 10 new areas for you to compete in. The soundtrack with its rock inspired mythic focus suits the game well as do the sound effects. Overall, it’s a good looking game, especially on high detail.So do I recommend this game? If you’re a fan of Blood Bowl, than you’ve come to the right place but just be warned that online play is a must. Sports fans would probably be annoyed due to the limited control of the players but once again this game is a strategy not an arcade sports title.			",2267,868,87,236,310,22,349

												(tl;dr below)After reading reviews and watching some videos, I discovered that this might be a tough game to learn. With that in mind, I bought the legendary edition for full price, thinking I could upgrade to the chaos edition after I learned how to play. That was yesterday. Well, today, the Chaos edition went on sale for $12 for the next 4 months. How positively unfortunate. Well, for those of you looking for more info and less facepalm, the game is a blast...so far. I jumped straight into an offline campaign (classic mode, hard difficulty). I've only played the first 2 games, but they were both nail-biting, edge-of-my-seat fun. I won both games (first one came down to the last 2 turns, second one was much easier). I'm sure the competition will get harder as all our teams level up.I noticed in the reviews people complaining about the RNG, claiming it's all dumb luck; after watching several games and playing 2 myself, this really isn't as bad as they make it out to be in my opinion. Look at all your options each turn, take the low-risk actions first, then go for the high risk actions at the end of your turn (or don't even take the high-risk actions if you don't need to). It's a strategy game about risk management, not a blind RNG hack and slash. You really need to think things through, or you are really going to hate the game. Yes, there's dice, and yes, sometimes those dice will want to violate you. Painfully. But it IS within your power to severely effect the LIKELIHOOD of such events. I was able to end the bulk of my turns by clicking the ""End of Turn"" button rather than bad rolls. The few that were ended from bad rolls were mostly high risk actions that I knew full well ahead of time might end badly, and I was sure to take those actions last for that very reason.During the first game, I used up the full 4-minute time bank almost every turn to really look over my options. 4 minutes might seem like a lot, but when you are new to the game it goes by fast. At first I had trouble frantically trying to get through everything I wanted to before the time ran out. Fortunately, somewhere between the first and second game I started being able to regularly figure out my plans and execute them with a cool head and time to spare. It helped that I watched several pvp matches before I bought the game.I can't say much about the rest of the game (all the different team strategies, game modes, skills etc), as I haven't explored it all yet, but I can say with confidence, I most certainly will. I do know that every team plays different, and that the way you set up each team (funds, skills, roster, formations etc) makes them play vastly different as well. Those different possibilities coupled with the fact that there is RNG involved really means there are many different game experiences to be had, and I look forward to trying them out. I am very excited to add this game to my library and wear it out, even if I DID buy it for full price the DAY BEFORE IT WENT ON SALE FOR 60% OFF FOR THE NEXT 4 MONTHS!Sheesh...Just gonna forget that happened. Eventually.tl;drGame -> GoodBuy.Play.Be happy. Or infuriated due to dice rolls. But still somewhat kinda happy somewhere deep down.			",106,31,9,26,47,1,14

												For sale on steam: Membership to a cult.Specifically, the cult of Nuffle - Chaos god of random♥♥♥♥♥♥happening in an amusing way.Welcome to Bloodbowl, a turn based tabletop sports game/religious ceremony of Nuffle based off the Warhammer fantasy boardgame of the same name.For those unaware of Bloodbowl and what it is. It is essentially what happens when you take (American) football and set it in the Warhammer universe. For those who don't know American football, players take a ball and try to run it into the opponent's endzone, at the other side of the field.This scores them a point, and whoever has the most points at the end of the match wins.Unique to Bloodbowl, however, is that it's heavier on the action. Orks don't particularly enjoy making a run with the ball to see if they can score that way. They'll just get together and try to punch their way through the opponent's lines. And this can lead to injuries or even deaths on both sides.Also different from the physical sport is that this is mainly turn based(A real-time mode exists too, if you prefer that). Players take turns moving their players and performing actions. It is surprisingly strategic and you need to think about your moves. You can do a lot of risky things, but your turn ends immediately if things go too wrong. If your players go down, if you fail to pick up the (Often slippery) ball, you score a point or you run out of time to make your moves - That's the end of your turn. This, combined with the chance based mechanics (It is based off a boardgame, dice are involved in pretty much all actions) and a critical success and failure system means that anything is possible. You can come back from the worst of positions, and you can always end up losing from the best of positions, but there is skill to be found here other than just random luck. Skill, and strategy in Bloodbowl is not twitch based, build orders, or micromanagement. Instead of that, It's your risk management. If you can position your players so that they force your opponent to take risks, then it is likely that he will at some point fail at it. And then you can come in, get the ball loose, and try to score. If you do not know how to attack the opponent's defensive formation without taking unnecessary risks, you'll end up with players laying down and the opponent stealing the ball away from you. The lack of 100% winning strategies, and chance based things mean that every match is different, and as such it has great replayability, variety, and new situations almost every time you play, while the online play, private leagues, and team progression means you will be able to play a long time without getting bored.When things go well, and your worst player slaps down an ogre? Praise Nuffle! When your elf catcher trips on his own shoelaces and breaks his neck? Praise Nuffle!The end result of a match isn't the goal you're playing for. It's the journey there - If you don't take it too seriously you'll be able to enjoy this game, but if you can't stand bad luck where you can just roll critical failures every turn? It might just be frustrating then.For fans of games that do things differently, or just fans of boardgames, I can recommend this. And if you're wondering about Legendary and Chaos edition then don't worry. They're compatible with eachother. You'll be able to play with people who own the other version too			",162,24,0,26,61,4,94

												Its a faithful board game conversion that I am certain (despite rampant criticism) does not cheat.  Unfortunately, the AI is so bad I sometimes wish it did.  Even so, the game is fun in single player and more fun in multiplayer.  As for the board game itself, it is strategic and occaisionally random enough to make it interesting.  Game balance is kind of wacky (in the board game as well, some teams are difficult to play on purpose) but this only adds to the charm in my opinion.  The bragging rights one wins when scoring a touchdown as the Halflings counts as a buff in my book.			",69,4,0,22,22,2,43

												I loved this game, Khemris are so fun to play, crushing other players is SO fun!If you liked the boardgame then you must want to get it already, but for the newbies i'll try to describe why this game is so good. The number of teams is really nice because each team represents different playstyle : the humans are pretty much balanced and you'll be able to throw passes or run through the opponent's line whereas elves' playstyle is based mainly on passes and dodging tackles due to their agility, Khemris will try to litteraly crush the opponent's line to get their holder of the ball to the touchdown because they can't do a single pass while gobelins will play dirty by using unconventionnal weapons during the match such as chainsaws, pogo sticks etc...At the beginning you'll be a little lost if you didn't play the board game because nearly nothing is explained, you'll have to read the rules book and that will take you about 1h to get through this but when you master the rules it gets really fun. You should start by playing the campaign mode because that's how you'll learn most easily.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												My old review for this was positive. And it technically still is. Blood Bowl is a great game. The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.Keyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.Ordinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game.

												Board game to video game translations are rarely any fun to anyone except players of the original board game.  Blood Bowl: Legendary Edition continues this grand tradition by being completely impenetrable to anyone that's not completely familiar with the board game.  To be clear, I've spent two hours trying to figure out the rules, I've played through the tutorial several times, and I've even browsed the official rulebook.  I still don't have the faintest clue what's going on.  Just for the hell of it, I played a match using the biggest handicap I could muster.  I was completely murdered.If I had to guess, and at this point that's all I have, the problem is with the source material, not with the translation to a video game.  There's apparently a die role for EVERYTHING.  Want to walk forward three feet?  Roll a die.  Want to kick the ball?  Roll a die.  I can't see how anyone could actually play this on cardboard.  Strangely enough, all these rules become a bigger problem in the computer version.  The elves just scored a touchdown and I can't figure out how...they passed at least a dozen skill checks, and they went by too fast for me to understand what happened.So, for a final word, if you like the board game, you'll probably like the adaptation.  There are a ton of teams in this version and it looks like a ton of rules have been implemented.  As a newcomer to Blood Bowl, however, I was completely lost and the game did nothing to help me.

												Definitely a  different take on Football.  I have always admired Games Workshop for their awesome tabletop selection, however the original Warhammer and Warhammer 40k figures were a bit out of my price range.  Overall this is a really fun and challenging game, with plenty of humorous commentary to go along with the over-the-top concept of Turn-based Football Warfare.  Highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys Turnl-based strategy and table top war games.			",166,5,4,12,9,3,12

												Blood Bowl is an awesome game, full of trolls and orks and violence and football. Or rugby. Kind of a rugbyfootball. I had never played the miniature game, but having grown up in comic and game shops, was exposed to it and always loved the concept. As far as I can tell and from what my buddies tell me, this is very faithful to the core mechanics of the miniature game, as well as the teams available and rules for how to make up your teams.Don't be fooled by the single player feature, this is a multiplayer game. Unlike most games however, this isn't not a pick up and play game. Don't get me wrong, you can, but this is a game designed around leagues and competition.There are thousands of laughs to be had and I reccomend this game to anyone who loves tactical strategy titles. When your star player reaches level 5 when most other players in the league are 2 at most, you'll really learn what Blood Bowl is when you watch him die as the medics fail to revive him because an angry fan threw a rock at him.

												Jolly good! A marvelous and sophisticated, sportsmanlike activity, which compels rugged, dashing and well mannered players to gently push each other out of their paths, as they valiantly attempt to transport the ball into their opponent's goal line. Whereupon each side humbly congratulates the goal scorer and bears no grudges upon the next kick off. Friendly medical staff stand by to treat the occasional scratch or bump that the players might suffer now and again. All-in-all, this is a very gentlemanly sport, which promotes goodwill and .... AAAAAH! Who am I kidding? If you believed that crock, then you should not buy this game!!! Because you'll only find violence aplenty, grudges, spikes, bad tempers, kick-em-when-they're-down tactics, haymakers, broken backs, ugly ruffians, even uglier players, blood red grass, bribery and all those other things that fans enjoy in a ball game. RAAAAGGHHHRRR!! (That part was added just for effect)			",52,19,0,19,12,1,21

												I know there are a ton of fans of this game and it's later releases, but one thing I need to let people now, this game has a ton of rulesand a very steep learning curve.From the way the store page is set-up I got this game thinkingit was a turn-based version of American Football with a fantasy theme.I couldn't have been more wrong.The game requires a LOT of reading, practice, more reading through Wikis,rulebooks and online videos.*** This is NOT American Football simulator ***.This is a statisical sports game that uses dice rolls, a ton of rules andeach player has different abilities that you have to know what each one if for,you have to know how the odds and dice rolls affect every action in the gameand it even uses Crowd/Fan reactions to determine how a play is carried out.A very confusing mix and sports, dice, and magic abilities.I know American Football rules very well and they did not help me at all!The tutorial is not straight forward at all and seems to come at you asif you understand a lot more about the game than you would.When something isn't explained the tutorial just tells you to read the rulebook.Sorry guys, but unless you already have played the board game and understand it,OR you have days and weeks to dedicate to learning an entirely new type of sports game,that has as many rules as a D&D gamebook, then you are going to be as confused as I was.I honestly thought this was ""Madden with Orcs"". It is nowhere near that.I am not downvoting this because it's a bad game.It looks like if you had the time to learn everything yourself,(The tutorial does NOT do it's job) then, this game might be something worth playing.But if you come into this with the same expectations I did, you will be upset and feel lost.I am downvoting this because the store page for this game did sell it as a ""Madden with Orcs""type of game, nowhere in the videos or descriptions did it make it clear justhow deep of a learning curve this game requires.

												I bought this game several years ago. I'm not quite sure why I did but it was on sale and I thought 'why not?'. I got a good 20 or so hours in but the whole time I didn't really know what I was doing. I didn't bother read the rulebook and I was going about the game by feel. Yet somehow... I was having fun. I didn't even bother with the story mode or anything. I just kept setting up games with teams I thought looked cool and had at it! Fast forwarding to now, I had a strange urge to play Blood Bowl again but this time actually learn how to play. I did the tutorial, read through the rulebook, watched some YouTube videos of people playing the actual board game itself, and played some of the campaign with a nice dwarven team I called ""The LIttle D's"" with the motto ""Our♥♥♥♥♥♥♥are small but so are you!"". From what I've seen on the discussions, you will NEED to read the rulebook or else you won't be having much fun here. The game really isn't that hard but there's a slight learning curve that I really think isn't so bad. Now onto the game...When it comes to core gameplay, it's quite fun! It's essentially just the board game so in the chance you've played and liked Blood Bowl in real life, you'll enjoy this too. After you create a team and really make it your own, you can then play through the campaign or make special matches or whatever. During each individual match, you set up 11 of your guys however you wish. The ball gets kicked and then you and your opponent take turns trying to grab the ball and take it to the end zone to score a point. It's really not that easy though! You'll be constantly moving players around trying find the best position, knocking guys over, pushing through walls of enemies, tossing the ball, and so on. There is an element of chance in there though that forces you to be careful. Each one of your guys may only move once BUT if a 'turnover' occurs then you must immediately end your turn and you'll only get 16 turns total in a game! At eight turns the game resets for it's halftime. For a turnover to occur, you might drop the ball, fail to pick it up, one of your guys gets turned flat on their face, and more. Imagine only moving one guy out of eleven and then your opponment moves all their fellas! That's a massive setback. The risk-management of this game keeps you on your toes. Not only that, who knows what could happen! Maybe one of your guys screws up what should have been an easy task or someone just flat out dies! If you want a game that relies 100% on skill then this isn't for you. To me, I prefer 100% skill but it's still quite fun nonetheless! I will admit, I've enjoyed this game so much that I'm considering buying a physical copy of Blood Bowl and buying the sequel Blood Bowl 2. If you got the cash, it might be better to just purchase the second game over this version but I haven't tried it so I can't say. Also, apparently the board game version released a 5th edition just last year on the gamesworkshop website. It's 99 bucks. If you've never done miniature wargaming or the like before, people often times paint their miniatures. Gamesworkshop sells special paints you can use to paint the models it comes with. I look forward to doing that myself. In regards to multiplayer, I have yet to try it. Personally, this feels like the type of game I'd rather play with friends, family, and maybe folks at a games shop. Even still, I don't have an opinion outside of that. I'd assume most folks have moved on to the second version of the game but I can't say. Singleplayer has been very fun and rewarding for it feels somewhat like a sandbox game to me. I can come up with all sorts of scenarios to play through and mix the rules up a bit or whatever I want. After all that windin up, I just let it go and see what happens! The game is really best played from that perspective over just purely winning in my opinion. RNG will do nothing but♥♥♥♥♥♥you off for this is a game with lots of risk involved. Every match is an adventure with a whole rollercoaster of ups and down and twists and turns. I've had games where I was just about to win and then something crazy happened like I tripped up or somehow the enemy managed to catch up with me. It's all these little things that keep the game exciting and fun. If that sounds good to you then I highly recommend giving Blood Bowl an honest try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10This game is perfect for anyone famliar with the bloodbowl game. Brutal at times if you're not caeful, always best to double check the route your taking and tackle zones when moving around as that auto route can be a little wonky sometimes, but other than that flawless representation of the board game.Note for newbies, this game is brutal and punishes mistakes harshly, make sure to put the time in the learn how the system works to avoid getting frustrated.

This game makes you care about your team like no other.The learning curve is steep but there are plenty of begginers guides on youtube to help you.

												Turnbased fantasy sports game, is pretty kickass. Kind of like merrican football (maybe? I dunno, merrican football is whacked as all hell) but heavily based on dice rolls whenever you pass, catch, tackle etc.It's all about positioning, weighing up risk/reward etc. pretty deep stuff. There's also a ton of races each with their own way of playing the game and specialties that fits rather well, and somehow ends up being fairly balanced (although dark elves kick♥♥♥♥♥deal w/ it)If you like the idea of orcs beating on elves and then screwing their cheerleaders, should check it out.

												Loved playing this as a tabletop in person, and I love how the game recreates that exactly... only with animating the action. Personally I favor playing undead. Which quite frankly suck as a just starting out team. And yet it's a fun team to play too. The stratagy is deep, although bad luck can ruin even the best stratagy. Conversely good luck can allow a bad stratagy to pull through too. Definately not an easy game, but a very fun one.			",30,4,0,9,5,1,4

												I know that blood bowl II is available, and that it has a better graphic, but this game is still the way to go IMO.And now to the serious part!: let the review begin!He tackles, he runs, heeeee fumbles and fails miserably (not again)!- blood bowl is not a game for the faint of hearted or those for whome random misfortune always strikes (trust me it does, things that will only happen mathematically 0.014% has happened to me in a match xD).With this being said it is highly competitive, great to fight your friends in your own league and often times fine to fight the more experienced players who has leveled up a team or two.I can recommend reading the rulebook, as most aspects of the game will be explained here and it will give you a way better approach and understanding of the game.But if you like sports games, tactics and a bit of violence here or there I would definitely recommend picking up bloodbowl legendary or chaos edition (stick with this version as you have assess to so many more teams than in the 2. :) ).Best of luck to you and happy gaming dear reader!

												This is one of those games. I wish that had a neutral response for a recommendation. However, as a first  timer of this game. I must say it's really fun, and really challening.First off, this game is great for the fans who played the table-top version. If your a fan of the board game, then you'll be a fan of the games. Although not perfect, the game is at least enjoyable for the fan.However, for the casual gamer who didn't play the table top version and decide to get this game for whatever reason. The learning experirence might be ""straight-foward"" but in reality it requires trial by error. Meaning, in order to get better at the game you'll have to lose a bunch of times in order to get better. My advice? Play with a friend who owns the game. But don't go straight to the multiplayer, the tutorial is there, but it doesn't come across as ""helpful"" sure it might sound easy enough, but that is why there is the ""in-game manual"" in that manual it broaden's the game and really get's in-depth.The game overall has a bunch of stuff: teams with their unique players and stats. You can customize them, and fight in some very amazing locations. You have two modes a Blitz mode that can tailor your experience, and a classic mode that follows the rules of the table-top.Lastly the game has a ""luck"" system. Sure it might not be so direct, or it could not exist at all and is mainly player error. What I am trying to say is. If you ""rage quit"" it's not the games fault. The game has everything right then and there to help you. And if you have to lose in order to win. Go ahead and lose at least you get the experience to make yourself better. Don't hate the game because it's ""un-fair"" no it's because you need to fully grasp the game's concept and mechanics.Overall if you like this sort of game. I recommend it.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												I have been a fan of the game since its original version of the mid 80's (which was cardboard cut-outs) and every version since.  BB is one of the most well designed games ever produced by Games Workshop, and the classic timed *turn-based* computer version is a faithful emulation of the boardgame.  The game has three formats--the classic version of the game, the classic version with some additional rule variants and customization options (which can be fun), and the 'real-time' Blitz version.  Of the three versions, the most fun for me is the classic version with or without the variants.  I do not enjoy the Blitz version of the game at all.  Regardless, the title is worth owning.  For me, the replay value is very high and I especially enjoy playing against my son in multiplayer mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I thought about buying it because it seemed like a football game. It is not. It is a board game.That being said, it is an amazing board game with tons of strategy to be used by each individual race. Yes, each race has positives and negatives, but if you play your cards (rolls) right, you can beat any team with any other team. If I were to compare its strategy to any sport I would say soccer with a small mix of football. Marking players and utilizing tackle zones is your best bet. All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy, violence, or Warhammer. All 3? Absolutely get this game.			",20,3,3,3,1,2,7

												The game is a pretty good bit of fun, but a huge issue is that literally 90% of the game is dice rolling. And they don't pretend to hide it either. Basically the entire strategy of the portion is to limit the dice rolling to be in your favor as much as possible or to try and avoid it alltogether OR to stock up on rerolls. Now again, the game is pretty fun, when things work out in your favor. But it can be incredibly frustrating when playing a neck and neck match with someone and then losing your entire turn the first move because you failed a dice roll.There's also some serious balancing issues with several races being incredibly worthless and a few being super powerful and still easy to play. Regardless, the game is an interesting take on a 'fantasy football' (Yes, that's what I'm going to call this) type of game with some amusing commentary... for the first 3 matches. For a game that's been rereleased a dozen times I'd expect it to be more polished, but if you want about a few hours of enjoyment from a unique turn based strategy game then you can't really go wrong here.7.4/10.

												Focus home interactive are complete morons unable to do a single thing right. However they still couldn't completely destroy the spirit of bloodbowl. This game isn't entirely as fun as it could've been with version 3 of the rules, but the version 4 version makes the game play faster ; ideal for the computer. Beats having to remember and calculate stuff when playing the board game version. Version 4 of the rules means strength has the advantage over agility though, making it not as well balanced as it could've been. Nevertheless. It's a good game. Just turn off the music and comentary once you've heard all stuff it has to say (in like 5 minutes).			",1280,529,93,186,187,22,306

But instead of getting some good gameplay and an idea of what Blood Bowl is all about it breeds frustration and leads to rage quits and players bursting out in rants on how the game is cheating. This could have been avoided with a more thorough tutorial, the option of a more forgiving gameplay and a less step learning curve. As it is now it just makes me sad.			",167,53,5,32,23,3,67

As usual I'm gonna start talking about what it does worse, then move up from there. First and foremost, the worst part of the game has to be it's difficulty for new players. It's a board game of sorts directly ported to a video-game... But as it usually happens, good board games are complex as all hell, and that translates poorly for new players. It also doesn't help that the difficulty spike is directly at the start: you create your own team and then suddenly you're thrusted with little knowledge of how to play against teams that actually DO HAVE QUITE THE LEVEL ALREADY. Your team will be on a sick losing spree from the beggining because, even though the game says there's around 140 or so teams on the game, you'll be playing against the same mid-level ones over and over. If I start on a 0 prestige league, WHY THE HELL PUT MID-GAME TEAMS ON IT, EVEN ON THE LOWEST DIFFICULTY!? IT'S STUPID. However that's switched around later, when your team actually gets levels and becomes decent, the enemies are actually rather easy to predict.The second other problem this game has is actually related to that one, too. Remember when I talked about this game being a board-port with tons of rules? Well, this game has a tutorial that last around 10 minutes and all it does is teach you how to move characters, knocking people into the ground and the bare minimum to start playing. It's kinda pathetic when the game has so many damn rules and can be so damn challenging and outright painful to play for new players. The worst part of it all is that I did a bit of research online, and on the Steam forums some people say that to understand the game correctly you gotta read the manual, and also giving a link to a PDF file of said manual... WHICH HAD OVER 50 BIG PAGES OF RULES. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥. IT'S A F#CKING VIDEOGAME, NOT A SCIENCE PROJECT!Taking that aside, though, what do we have left? A really fun and adicting game, once you actually learn what the f#ck you're doing.The gameplay, after you learn about it and get over the start difficult spike, is fun as all hell. Now sure it feels lame when the enemy team pulls off something completely stupid that somehow works, like a ball carrier somehow dodging three players and scoring a touchdown, but all races have their own advantages and styles of play. Wood elfs for example are great at doing large passes and evading blocks, however they just S#CK at melees and end up with multiple injured and DEAD players at them. On the other hand you have guys like the Orcs and Dwarfs, who are violent and while not having much control over the ball, can just win by injuring and killing other players. IT'S LIKE MADDEN MIXED WITH WARHAMMER, ONLY ACTUALLY FUN!Talking about races, there's like 30 or even more of them, lost count. That's A LOT of variety, I'm pretty confident anyone can find a race that fits their playstyle, me actually going Dwarf because F#CK YOU, YOUR STAR PLAYER IS NOW DEADER.The multiplayer is also fun. I've only played one match so far online but it was so fun and competitive that I can see myself going back to it once in a while.Lastly, the commentators are actually quite fun to hear, as they comment on the races of each team, their characters and such. It sucks that the variety of quotes for each one of those is quite low, but hey, can't have everything.Do I recommend this game? It depends. If you like board games and have tons of patience, then you'll have lots of fun with the game. If however you don't have much of that, stay away FOREVER. The game is HARSH with new players that don't have any damn idea what this game is all about. It also doesn't have Steam Overlay support, which is stupid.TL;DR Edition: Fun board game ported into an actual video-game. The learning curve and difficulty spikes are some of the most harsh ones for new players, however once you learn about it you'll have tons of fun with it. And the multiplayer is fun too, still with players on it.			",167,20,8,24,14,4,23

												It´s very difficult to recommend this game, because is a turn based game that uses dice rolls to decide the outcome of all actions you make. The problem is that the dice rolls are wrong. They sould throw random numbers, but this is not the case. Dice rolls usually favour the computer player.The game seems to have broken mathematics and maybe some bugs. You can make limited re-rolls to avoid bad rolls, but usually this re-rolls do not have effect, as they throw exactly the same result too many frecuently.Also, in some situations, you get low probabilty results (like doubles when making a foul) with a very high frequency.Get it only if you plan to play exclusively online against human players. Against the computer, the game is totally frustrating due to the AI cheats/bugs.			",128,17,13,18,12,2,49

												One has to be a die-hard GW fan to appreciate it through all the little irritations this game provides, which pile up in to a massive pain in the rear. Tutorial teaches nothing in a game based on 100500 detailed moves. Autosave is non existant, and one will assume that there is an autosave, because the manual one is hidden so deep that it will take you a few restarts of the campaign to realize where it is. Crashes, glitches etc. It was cute at first but now its just frustrating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would probably overlook the squishing, but every 2-3 seconds I get a frame freeze (it's small, <0.5s), it's noticeable and very annoying (my setup is way beyond min. requirements).

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #26 - Blood Bowl: Legendary EditionI had heard of Blood Bowl, and knew it was based on a tabletop game, but otherwise I did not know anything about it.  So going in, I had no idea what to expect.Since I hadn't played before, I started with the tutorial, hoping it would help me understand how to play the game.  After waiting awhile for it to load (longer than I would have expected), it opens with a pair of commentators to explain the rules of the game, with some groan-worthy humor thrown in.The tutorial starts out simple enough by explaining the basic camera controls, and how to change cameras.  Then it covers ""tackle zones"" and placing your teams starting positions for the kick off.  It also explains the concept of re-rolls, which allow you to re-roll a die result, with each team only getting a limited number of these.But things quickly get complicated once the actual gameplay starts.  The game is filled with all of these different skills that players can have.  Each skill acts as a conditional modifier, depending on the situation.  For example, when picking up the ball, the game will ""roll a die"" and if the roll is too low, then you'll fail to pick up the ball.  But, if your player has the ""Sure Hands"" skill, then the player gets a second roll when the first one fails.It seems that pretty much every action in the game has one of these skills associated with it.  If I try to pass the ball, there's a 'Pass' skill that lets you re-roll a failed roll.  The game also starts talking about stats like Agility, and some kind of ""Agility Table"" that is used for skill checks, but apparently you have to read the rules to see that.Next the tutorial moves onto blocking and pushing past defenders.  Now even more skill checks are coming into play.  Here the roll is based on the Strength stat, and not only are there skills for influencing the block result, but also whether or not players get injured or not.As the tutorial continues into movement, dodging and blitzing, and even more die rolls and skills, I can feel my eyes starting to glaze over.   By the time the tutorial gets to the first turnover, I am pretty much lost.  I'm just kind of reading and nodding along at this point.  Just to give an idea of how quickly the tutorial starts piling on skills, here's one of the things it tries to explain to me:  ""Since Krug Painspear has the tackle skill, Jean-Paul mussen is knocked down with a 'Defender Stumbles', even though he has the Dodge skill, which would normally allow him to regard that as a simple push-back.""The commentators swear that although it sounds complicated, it's all really easy after a few games.  I'm not so sure.  I'm reminded of this episode of Star Trek where Kirk has been captured by these gangsters, and he introduces them to a card game called Fizzbin.  Only the game doesn't exist, and Kirk is making up the rules as he goes, and the gangsters are completely confused as Kirk tries to explain the game.  That's exactly how I felt after finishing the tutorial.So clearly there is a learning curve here.  So it comes down to whether or not it's worth spending the time to learn the game.  If you are a fan of the board game, then it seems pretty obvious you'll enjoy this as well.    If you like tabletop war games in general, and aren't intimidated by rules, then it's also likely you'll enjoy this.  But if you are more of a casual player, then this game will likely go right over your head as it did mine.			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												Graphically, whilst it doesn't look amazing, it does look good and the character models are very nice. Sadly, that is where the positives end. Given that they only really had to implement the rules of the table top game with some net code, I didn't think they could mess things up, but it really appears as though they did their best to give the user the very worst experience imaginable. It felt as though they put in very little effort from a UI perspective. No excuse for such a shoddy menu system in this day and age. The menus were slow and clunky and navigating between pre-match screens took overly long. Also, I found it impossible to set up a 1 off game with a friend over the net. The only clear way to play against each other was to set up a league and we weren't allowed to only have 2 teams in the league. Then, creating a custom team was a pain. When I finally gave up trying to play against a human opponent (which was the main reason I bought the game in the first place), I decided to play a match against the AI, so the game wouldn't have been a complete waste of money. The game and AI was very buggy. The game crashed multiple times and during 1 match, after a few turns, the opposing AI team failed to move a single player for 4 consecutive turns and for each of those turns I had to wait for the turn clock to run down so I could take my turn. This is a second rate implementation of an excellent table top game.			",379,106,14,33,36,10,71

												An impossibly difficult game which does not allow for the growth of the player. The way this is justified by saying that on 'easy' the opponant moves randomly, 'normal' the computer is overpowered compared to the player to ""increase challenge"", and on 'hard' the computer is impossibly hard. Basically, no matter which strategy you try you will always be beaten by the computer.Two player is alright, but only because a human opponant is not random or super-powered.			",93,26,1,9,26,1,11

												Unsurprisingly, everything about the game system is there and feels great. However, the amount of bugs has been (and remains) shocking and the game is currently unplayable - unless you're willing to ignore countless lost saves, stuck positions etc.Just to demonstrate: You've got ONE save per campaign which can last a hundred hours. You got no autosaves, meaning you REALLY got to think about saving. On balance, once in EVERY game you play, things (meaning engine/camera/technical sh*t, not your dice rolls) go t*ts up and you must quit and restart (losing an hour of gameplay at least, since you only can save at certain poitns). And you better pray you rememmer NOT to save before quitting, because otherwise you're saving the bug as well.Result: Unplayable. Believe me, I'm a Blood Bowl vet, I've really wanted to love this game, but technically it's so far beyond failure it's touching Dodo and the Dinosaurs.			",71,25,0,31,8,1,26

The overall feeling I get while playing it, is either the devs were rushed, or had no love for the game while making it.I wish I had my $8.00 back, but thank god I got it on sale.I was expecting the kind of polish that Dawn of War had, taking a tabletop game and making a fun and involved game out of it.This feels like a mod for some other game. A bad mod. One that should have stayed free.			",331,44,6,68,42,3,80

												I think I just need to stay away from Games Workshop type games altogether. I'm not going to claim that the game is cheating however, I don't have the time to study each individual opponent player (literally it gives you a timer) and devise a decisive strategy when there are SO many factors involved.  The game just feels overwhelming.  So the mistake I make is just use a common stat compare strategy and go for it.  Granted this is my problem and I'm not giving this game a gripe for it but personally I'm just not having fun.  Its way to frustrating and it is just not my cup of tea.  I'm just not a fan of constant dice rolling, especially digital dice rolling.  If your a fan of the tabletop game then go for it but as a standalone strategy game.... meh, pick it up when its on sale but I can't recommend it if your easily frustrated and angry at life to begin with.

												For anyone who has played the board game then this game is a welcome addition to the realm of Blood Bowl. However if you are new to this then I can see why some will cry 'foul' as the tutorial is nigh on useless considering the huge amount of rules and factors that are applied within it. BUT.. Stick with it and view some of the vids on Youtube (particularly the Blood Bowl Basics by Totalbiscuit) which are VERY useful. You'll soon be 'Mighty Blowing' your way through the game. My 11 year old son has mastered this and regularly beats me (which can cause tension), so ultimatley anyone can play this fun, mindlessly violent game :) !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is gosh darn awswome. It is frustating at times, but frustrating in an endearing sort of way. You will also never get closer to the tabletop game and a cheaper version of it. There is also a lot of intricacy between team customization that leads you to figure out the intricate details of how best to beat the game. Another cool feature of this game that it has local multiplayer where you can play with a buddy of yours on the same computer if they don't own it.

												     Blood Bowl is a great tabletop game... this is not.  If you enjoy long loading screens for pointless animations, a frustrating and poorly designed user interface that required more effort to learn than actually playing the game, a campaign mode with no auto save that requires manual saves every 5 minutes, then by all means get this game.     The game is not fun.  It is frustrating.  Not because Blood Bowl is (and it is) frustrating at times, but because Cyanide failed to produce a playable and enjoyable product for an otherwise great title.			",5,2,0,7,6,1,16

Captains Log, 26.10.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Blood Bowl – Legendary Edition. Referee paid! Beer? Bought! Secret Weapons for the sidelines? Activated! Okay, we are set for a round of bloody fantasy football then! Let the blood be spilled!  [I have not tested the real-time gameplay. Consider that while reading the review.]First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]So this is a Warhammer game huh? Okay. But….it is about football! Well, not exactly Football. More like Blood Bowl! This game is really a tactics game with a lot of layers of tactical shenanigans you can get up to if you 1) understand them 2) take time to think about it. The game presents itself as a “favorite sport of orcs, elves and other warhammer races” kind of a turn based sport themed tactical game of quite the challenging difficulty and satisfying gameplay:Being set in the Warhammer Universe Blood Bowl gives the player a choice of different races and factions as a base for the team. Each Team has different skills they excel at, for example smashing heads or running very fast, blowing themselves up or calling for outside help! There is a rulebook included in the game which represents the exact rules for the boardgame parent that this game was fashioned after. And then some more! Because it is not only a conversion (and a good one at that) it is also an expansion because there is a realtime mode and a turn based mode available which changes the game a lot. Sadly though for this review the real time mode couldn’t be tested (will be done as soon as possible)There are different game modes to allow for different sets of gameplay, speed and challenge. A tutorial is include (with fully voiced commentary from of the field-very nice!)It is a game based on dice rolls. But don’t fear! It is not Spacehulk! (See my review for that sad board game sibling) You have enough options and tactical add-ons to prevent the dice roll to be all deciding. There are of course situations in which you still cringe….that is just the thing with the dice. (I guess at this point it is: take it or leave it)That being said: It is a very complex, intriguing, diverse, entertaining and challenging game of sports themed warhammer based strategy with so many layers that a regular onion starts to get jealous.Look and feel and sound: There are announcers in the game, they comment on certain moves, mistakes and outcomes of the game. The music is really well done. The sound effects, while not overwhelming, are solid enough to not distract from the game. The graphics are fitting, while not overwhelming. Camera controls are perfect and the game creates a nice atmosphere of actually standing at the sidelines and commanding your werewolf runners to “blitz that puny elf out or I’ll gut you like chickens after the game” *coughcough* I mean…you feel drawn into the game at a satisfying level. For me at least that was the case. In a good way.Captains Orders:You don´t have to be a sports game fan to like blood bowl, but it might tip the scales in you favour if you are. If you are into complex rules behind a pretty straightforward game concept (meaning you can just start playing and get better with each game)  then Blood Bowl serves your cravings. If you like Warhammer as a theme, it is a bonus. Not necessary! Verdict: Cargo!  It is a game that you have to invest some time into to get the rules and figure out your own tactics. It is really not for in-between. So for me, due to lack of time, I will have to wait until I touch this solid tactics game again. But I will. Definitely. And then I might even try the RTS Mode that exists!

												Clunky and ugly with an incoherent tutorial that reads more as a virtual companion to the tabletop game than as a standalone alternative. Fans of Blood Bowl in its physical form will find its digital counterpart to be playable, and some may even be able to take some kind of enjoyment from what is essentially a high-quality Breast/Cloth/Grass physics simulator. The game features a multiplayer option that doesn't seem to work in the off-chance that you find some kind of third-world orphan or withered hermit with a computer, an internet connection, and literally nothing to do except play this ♥♥♥♥ing game, who wants to play with you. The graphics are ugly and the menu design is confusing and overall this game reeks of ""Barry from Public Relations knows how to make low-quality games, lets start a company and obtain the license to an obscure Games Workshop property and ♥♥♥♥ it up"".Overall, high-tier Amazonian breast-jiggling and Grass swaying - that's about it.3 out of 18 stars.

												Poor AI takes away from what fun is to be had. Interesting game, but the AI makes it near impossible to play. They have issues picking up the ball, issues catching, and issues scoring as a team. The enemy AI on the otherhand has no issue with this and catches a pass perfectly, runs the right way, and has smart routes. While some people like the AI to have an advantage there is a difference. As your team can not actually play the game itself and you will find yourself losing for stupid reasons. I'd save yourself the time, money, and the frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I Like Bloodbowl and have played the wonky xbox 360 version (even worse!) , boardgame and recent cardgame. I would not recommend this Pc port though - as its lazy, there is no keypad support and very little options you'd expect from a pc game.. I've come to expect money-grubbing terrible gameplay from Games Workshop, as Blood bowl is one of the few game rules sets that is playable in their franchise.. I knew it would be a rough game but man do i feel buyers remorse!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is alright but the thing that brings it down is how it crashes.You can get like 1 game maybe a 2nd but not a 3rd game before it crashes.Since the game doesn't autosave (To what I know) when it crashes you will lose all of your progress, which sucks.(This is based on a little bit before I wrote this review, so it may or may not useful if they have updated the game)This game is alright even if you don't fully know how to play.The tutorial isn't to bad for learning the basics.

												As a game that tries to faithfully re-create the mechanics of the table-top game of Blood Bowl, this game does a good job. It is not, however, a football game with a fantasy setting; and it is this point that frustrated me the most. As someone who had not played the table-top game before, much less possessed any skill at it, I found making effective use of the mechanics in this game hard and the results were disappointing due to the very steep learning curve; successes were rare and offset by the frustrating ease with which failure occurred for even the simplest of tasks, and with little in-game guidance it was very difficult to even grasp at what I was doing wrong. What I have since learned is that this is not really a game about strategy with random elements, but rather ongoing mitigation of the high randomness that occurs turn-to-turn; and that just rubs me the wrong way.If you enjoy the table-top Blood Bowl game and/or you are very familiar with its rules, you'll probably enjoy this game. If not, this is likely to leave you just as frustrated as it left me; save your money for something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT buy this game because it has a warhammer title. Do some research on how the game mechanics work, it is turn based not action or entertainment based.After an agonizingly long tutorial you realise how bland and boring this is without even a hint of the epicness  you might expect from a warhammer game. The character models are awesome, but that's about the only thing I enjoyed about this game.The announcers are probably the single most worst feature of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An attempt at converting the Blood Bowl boardgame over to PC has mixed results. While the controls are intuitive and the rules make sense after a period of play the lackluster AI is bolstered by horribly pre-scripted success chances. While theoretically the AI rolls the chance dice as well they almost never suffer failure despite long odds. Wild examples include being able to dodge around 3 defenders simultaneously and throwing the ball the entire length of the field multiple times with no failures. Couple that with key moments of ""bad luck"" for your team at crucial points (bad dice rolls that result in your team dropping the ball right before putting it in the end zone, failed re-rolls, missed blocks and dodges, etc.) and you have a recipe for consistent frustration.

												I really wanted to like this game because i think it's a cool concept but it's really not worth it. Short version, it's outdated and dice based meaning that even if you play perfectly you will lose due to crap rolls of the dice and there is nothing you can do about it.Long version, every time you go to block you have an equal chance of hurting yourself as you do of hurting the enemy (who thought that was a good idea!). This becomes stupidly apparent as your trying to pound your way through eneny elf lines (elves are not strong) and yet you still injure your 7 strength deathroller when he tried to tackle a runner for the elves. Now the dice roll stupidity is a thorn in the side but seeing as how it's based on a board game i was willing to look past it. What really killed this game for me is that when you go to start any campaign or tourny you will have a fresh new team and the enemy team will have (not kidding) 5 or 6 level two players and sometimes a level 3, because winning with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dice rolls wasn't hard enough. If you like a game where strategy is key and you want to dominate your opponent into the ground, this is not your game. If you like a game that will be unfair and will force you to lose multiple times before you can build up your team, then go ahead and give this game a try.			",37,3,0,7,5,1,5

												The game is so close within a few rules options of bloodbowl that I almost call it perfect. The game play is easy. The only thing I might manage better is the options for creating a league. Ask anyone who own BB and no one knows the difference between a cup and a championship, how it translates to the BB league play, etc. There should be a straight up tutorial on how to set up a league and what each of the league options actually means. While some call the dice rolling og 16.66 percent over time a sign of fair play, I see it as a weakness of the game. Real life dice DO NOT roll each side and equal amount of time. Because of this, you can predict pretty much when to shut the game off and keep playing until the dice become more favorable. Basically the close you get to so many dice, the closer the game ""catches"" you up on terrible dice to offset the earlier good ones and it all comes in clumps. Due to the faulty RGI, it doesnt feel like BB, at least the TT version. The dice are a huge factor as to why I DO NOT recommend this game and I pray this fix this in later releases. Give me truly random dice please.			",1,0,0,0,0,3,3

												If you're not a fan of the table top game there's a chance you'll come across this and not be too interested. Get into it though and this is a great turn based sports game which is rare to find. Once you figure out the nuances of the rule set refined by dedicated game players over the years and start to find out more about the more unusual races and creatures available the depth and online scene should be enough to keep you coming back. It's not a perfect game but it's something different and worth looking at when on sales.There is the Chaos edition around but have to admit to not upgrading for a couple of extra teams but if only a pound or so more why not pick it up?

												You can liberally call this a 1:1 translation from a old (and not exactly small) boardgame into a PC-game. I never played the original game, but the interface feels nice and is easy to use. Which doesn't mean the rules ares easy to grasp (they're definitely not simple). But the game contains a basic tutorial and THE COMPLETE RULEBOOK in text form. Ye, that's 50 pages to read, but if you're a fan of Dice-RPGs, you will love it.Be warned though, as a dice-based action sport RPG, it is HIGHLY random and brutally unfair at times.Other then that, a nice pick up that can, if you are thoroughly interested, be a cheap pay for hundreds of hours.

												Others would say this game is a good one, but I say, nope.Here's why:RNG is not random at all.  There's no random anything, because I've seen dice rolls before, for this game on table top, and they aren't nearly this one sided even in the worst of cases (mini wargaming has videos with them playing this table top version, and even then they aren't nearly this bad).Difficulty setting?  No reason to lie, its hard, extra hard, might as well not play.  Actually, I'm wrong, it goes: don't bother, don't bother, don't bother.No change to difficulty changes any part of the game.  Meaning that you put it on easy?  It's still going to bend you over, put it on hard, it still, guess what, bends you over.  They make dodge after dodge, gfi after gfi, single dice blocks and double against and nothing happens.  The player?  First dodge fails, or second dodge fails (I haven't done double dodge moves because of this), single dice blocks are attacker down 90% of the time, rerolled into attacker down or both down, and double against?  Might as well buy another player at that point.This is the worst case of RNG I have seen in a game, in forever.  There's no reason the dice couldn't be actually ballanced or the rolls be actually random.I wouldn't buy anything from this dev, so long as it's a game that's supposedly an adaption of a table top game.  Since they have BB2, and the reviews are down right ugly for that game, I will not be purchasing or playing this game again.And if you've gotten this far, and wonder how someone could say such things about this game without playing it for a while?  Look at how many hours I've logged, and you can see I have given this game way more time than it actually deserves.1/10.  The one is for graphics, since these, although clunky and weird at times, do make the game look semi nice.I urge you, as a final note, not to get this game if you haven't already, and if you have, don't get BB2, you can read their reviews and see the issues, but lets face it, they took a turd, polished it, and handed it back to you...  What's that saying?  Polish a turd, its still a turd?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is usually my type of game, and I'm very forgiving of games in this type of genre and style.  I just thought I'd precursor saying that, because with that in mind - this is without a doubt, one of THE WORST GAMES I have EVER had the unfortunate displeasure of playing in my entire life.  I had seen some generally unfavorable reviews of the game but ignored them for the most part because I figure the general public usually wouldn't like a niche game like this.  I should have listened to them, and you should listen to me if you don't want to make the mistake of throwing your money toward one of the most unenjoyable trash games ever to be created.I don't even know where to begin.  Forget the steep learning curve of the game.  You can learn everything there is to learn about this game and it still won't be fun.  Unless you find having a guy who's wide open 2 squares away unguarded from an unguarded passer both with a ""passer"" skill and the receiver with a ""cather"" skill and still having the ball fall to the ground, ending your turn (because anytime you have something go ""wrong"" in this game, your entire turn ends.  Fun huh?)  then witnessing the enemy come up, pick up the ball, run through your entire defense and not get taken down at all and score at will - fun!If you like watching a ball get kicked off right to the ground beside your receiver who has ""sure hands"" skill, and still watching them try to pick up a ball and have it fumble off and end your turn again, then watch the enemy just jump through your defense and pick up the ball before you can even pick it up as you fumble turn after turn after turn in this awful sorry excuse for a game.Got a player that you really enjoyed having on your team?  Spent money on the ""apothecary"" (which is basically suppose to be something that prevents 1 injury to a player per game, of which there will be many) so you don't want your favorite star player to die and be gone forever?  Oh dont' worry, it won't do you any good.  I've played probably around 50 games and not ONCE has the apothecary ever worked when trying to heal someone.  Do you enjoy using tactics and strategy to win games?  Then this is not the game for you.  Do you enjoy having literally every simple stupid thing chocked up to the luck of a 6 sided die, that mysteriously the AI will always have go their way and you never will?  This is the game for you then.Do you enjoy halftime periods that are so awkwardly timed that any chance at having an exciting end to a game or half will without fail ALWAYS end before you can actually have... you know.. FUN at a game, and instead just end up thoroughly disappointed because you never get to witness anything awesome in this game?  This game is also right up your alley then.Do you enjoy having every little thing chocked up to D6 rolls, even the winnings when you actually are so fortunate to have won a game, your level ups when your players are lucky enough not to have died on the field or had a game ending injury, or literally every single kickoff of the game having some random event sway the game in your opponents favor, even if you have all the ""stats"" such as twice as many cheerleaders as the opponent and twice as many assistant coaches?  Once again, I've got a game for you - Blood Bowl, Legendary EditionThe only thing Legendary about this game is how awful it is.  There is ZERO fun to be had in this game, only frustration pain and suffering.  May the developers of this game be ashamed to have ever put something this god awful out on the market and actually profit from it.  Such a cool concept for a game, hopefully someone else will attempt to make similar games.  Without a doubt it wouldn't be hard at all to top this gutter trash of a game.0/10, there is literally NOTHING redeemable about this game.  At least most awful games can have something good said about this, but not this one.  Avoid this game, no matter who you are, unless you are a masochist.			",135,29,1,39,26,1,25

Even on easy mode, everything's against you from the start, the dice all seem loaded, it seems there's not a single roll made wrong on the opponent's team while everything you do is blocked or countered 90% of the time. For a fun game, one that makes you want to play it again, or to have any real value to actually giving it the time of day... Blood Bowl fails, and it does so epically.			",53,8,0,1,7,1,1

												Blood Bowl je igrica sa fenomenalnom idejom, izvrsno zamišljena igrica i stvarno ima potencijala.Međutim izvedba je katastrofalna, nakon nekog vremena kada ćete htijeti pobjediti malo teže protivnike (normali/hard) naići ćete na prepreku. Recimo jedan scenarij: kaos protiv wood elfova. Kaos je moja ekipa. Ja sam kiker i super opalim loptu ode na suprotni kraj terena od onog koj sam naciljao ali nema veze to je tak svejedno kuda lopta ode, pripisujem to šlampavosti mojeg kikera. i sad njegov wood elfe hvata loptu bezprjekorno i preće u marš na tuch down. meni u prvoj sekundi onesvjeste minotaura i još jedno od opakijih tipova. Ok nema veze pošaljem 4 obrambena igrača na napadača i napadač mi s jednim udarcem sruši 2 od moja 4 obrambena igrača. ostala dvojca ga dovoljno zadržavaju da dođe jos 4 mojih igrača minotar se osvjestio. Padaju još dva moja igrača od strane istog napadačkog igrača. Minotaur dolazi u bitku njegov napadač je sada okružen sa 6 mojih igrača od čega ih je 3 u nesvjesti, a jedan je minotaur. napadač udara mog minotaura i zadaje mu teške ozljede da nemože igrati do kraja utakmice. nakon 2 minute intenzivnog mlačenja napokon uspijem rušiti napadača. Pošaljem svojeg napadača po loptu. isklizne mu iz ruku, pošaljem opet, izklizne mu iz ruku. sada je več prošlo 20 sekundi hvatanja lopte po terenu sakupilo se 4 protivnička igrača oko mojeg bjednog jednog kada je uspio uhvatiti loptu. Brzo loptu šalem preko da izbjegnem napad protivnika. lopta uspješno poslana protivnik ne presjeca loptu.... lopta mojem igraču koj ju hvata ispada iz ruku. prošlo je 15 sekundi dok je moj igrač podignuo loptu s poda svi protivnici več e okupljaju oko njega. pokušavam dodati loptu kada mi ispada iz ruku. Ponovo pokušavam podignuti loptu nakon 5 neuspjelog pokušaja, lopta odlazi protivniku pod noge, on ju iz prve podiže napravi uspješno dodavanje, njegov suigrač besprjekorno hvata loptu ja šaljem svoju vojsku na njega (kažem vojsku jer šaljem 6 igrača). prvi pada gotovo u sekundi drugi se drži neko vrijeme no on isto pada. nakon pol minute borbe mojh 6 igrača ruši njegovog jednong nakon što ih je meni palo 4. napokon trčim u napad. Prvi obrambeni igrač protivnika ruši mog napadača u jednom hitcu, no mog napadača je pratilo 5 ljudi, tako da u roku od 40 sekundi uspjevam vratiti loptu na moju stranu, zapravo na pod gdje ostaje idučih 15 sekundi. Oke moj igrač napokon hvata loptu i trči prema liniji nakon što je njegovih 4 kolege onesvješteno i pada mrtav wood elfe ga je u jednom udarcu ubio dslovno ubio. super sada imam 9 od 11 igrača do kraja tekme jer mi je minotaur ozljeđen, a jedan igrač mrtav...... da ne opisujem dalje na kraju uspjevam protivnika dobiti sa 7/5 rezultatom (otkrio sam taktiku da ako sve igrače krečeš skupa ko hordu su jači i možeš čak doči do kraja).Igram 2 utakmicu i sve se ponavlja iz početka računalo pokazuje nadmoč no ja sa taktikom glavom kroz zid upjevam dobiti i drugu utakmicu u sezoni...Započinjem 3 utakmicu sve isto komp vara  ja sve svoje držim na hrpi i ovaj put uspjevam izvuč cak 11/2 ostalo je svega 25 sekundi do kraja imam zagarantiranu pobjedu. No igrica je imala drugačiju viziju od mene, te se rušu 25 sekundi preije kraja tekme.Ponovno palim igricu i idem loadat, kad shvatim da nisam saveao, a igrica nema auto save niti ga je moguče upaliti.Sav moj trud je izgubljen i gubim volju za daljnjim igranjem ove igrice.

												This game has a very difficult interface when it comes to playing with your friends. You need to register a new username and password with them and log in every time, and it does not always work! And then, if you manage to log in, you need to search for your friends in order to start a game with them, instead of just going through the Steam Friend List, and again it doesn't always work. Even after you have started a game, both of you can get kicked out in the middle of the match. I really did not have a good time with this, and both me and my buddy feel like we wasted out money. When we contacted support we got no replies, and when we asked other players, they said that this was standard for this developer.			",138,48,9,21,41,5,34

												This came in a $1 humblebundle I bought for another game. After the awful and uninformative tutorial I still had little of an idea how the game worked when I started a exhibition match. They went way overboard with the rules and overthought this game big time. All that happened when I tried to apply the tutorial rules in a exhibition match was I made two moves that I learned, the screen said ""turnover"", the enemy made about 15 moves, killed 3 of my guys and surrounded my guy that had the ball, then it was my turn, I tried to move my guy away from them, he fell down and died. I think it's something about roll modifiers and rolling a number higher than 3 and 4 to make handoffs and passes and blocks, but take that and complicate it with about five more layers of rules and you have this game.It requires a load of rulebook reading since the tutorial didn't help with♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's just what I want to do in my games: spend hours reading a rulebook. Even if I did learn it so what? This is just not a great game by any means, more clunky than anything.One of the more nonsensical, unfun, unintuitive, uninformative tutorial, impossible to win games I've ever played. -300/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												This game is probably the only way i could appreciate American Football. Its a really fun game, and as a massive warhammer nerd its strikes a particular cord in me. The game play, though turnbased, is pretty frantic and though its a game taht requires patiance and alot of restrain (from throwing out your PC when your star player dies). You will find this game addicitive i promise. I know BB2 has come out but from what i have seen it doesnt even come close to beating this game besides graphics and the little animations. As your players level up they will learn new skills with which to beat the other team (most often literally) from extra strength to mutations! Its fun is what im getting at, if you want fun, in single player AND Multiplayer, this is the game for you, great value. Because nothing makes me smile more when one of my dwarves slams one of those pansy elves in the ground when they try to dodge past with the ball ;)			",104,9,0,15,28,3,40

												An amazing yet infuriating game set in the Warhammer universe. Blood Bowl takes a turn based approach to American Football and with the help of a unique roster of 20+ races and factions, turns it into a violent and chance based struggle to the endzone. The less patient or and those easier to become enraged at RNG may not like it as you live and die by the dice and a single bad role can turn something as innocent to trying to pick up the ball into a bloodbath with multiple players dead and the enemy right at your endzone for the next turn. However, those that play and enjoy the game will learn and be able to do amazing things like kill the ball carrier, then retrieve the ball with another player, pass it to the team's star gutter runner (if you built a skaven team) and have him run all the way down the field dodging numerous defenders... only to break his neck when he trips in front of the endzone since once again, you live and die by the dice.

												Love this game. I know Chaos Edition is the way to go but I wanted to play the storymode and learn the history of the league, and for the sale price it was worth the fun. Think of the story mode as an extended tutorial for those of you unfamiliar with Bloodbowl... because getting used to the nuances of this quirky game does take awhile. The storymode sets simple goals for each match... sometimes you only play half a match... and you master the basics (or in my case re-remember how to play because its been several years since I used to play on my xbox 360). The bad luck rolls will drive you nuts and when your favorite player dies it breaks your heart but hey, that's Bloodbowl! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The PC version of Blood Bowl is as faithful a conversion of the brilliant Games Workshop board game as you will find. Each match is a tense sequence of tactical gambles, weighing up the odds of success and failure with every move. When played as such the game takes on chess-like properties, mixed with ludicrous victories and face-palming defeats.			",165,41,5,25,33,7,70

The AI is a little stupid, but you can always find a good match vs a human with the online multiplayer. You can also play hotseat, which I think is an amazing feature.

												Fairly obscure table-top game if you are not into that whole Wizards of the Coast scene, but this package makes it very very accessible and best of all -- no clean up and no cluttered tables for weeks on end!  The downside, of course, is that you can't customize your players with special paint jobs and poses, but I'm sure it's a matter of time before someone makes the next generation computer Blood Bowl game.  Until then, there's Cyanide's BB Legendary Edition -- all of the fun with none of the hassles!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An RNG at its finest. Build a fantasy team from the world of warhammer and have them play ""football"" or just have them kill one another. There is some skill involved, but this is most definitely a game for the pessimists. If you plan for failure you can only succeed, or fail miserably and kill your characters to then waste a roll to revive them. At least then you will be givien the option to have them either be dead or be dead. Seriously though, this will provide you with hours of entertainment, if you play a season mode I would recommend avoiding ""blitz"" mode as there are bugs and unworking features.

												1. It's a turn-based game which has a turn timer that can't be turned off. It is hard to come up with a sensible strategy in the limited time available.2. If you leave a match for any reason, even if you save it first, you will get hit with a loss in campaign mode.- Keep in mind that the above is in solo play. So there is no legit reason for the above.3. The AI teams you play against in campaign mode are all a lot better than yours. Going by the ratings that are given, the opposing teams are 50% better, and as I understand it, remain this much better than you even as you improve - and that's a best case scenario. So even if you set up your players in a semi-intelligent fashion, the AI can just dodge past you or run you over, since their guys have a lot more individual talent than yours.I gave Blood Bowl Legendary plenty of time because I usually like games like this, and I really liked the Blood Bowl game that was released in the 90's. But eventually I had to throw in the towel and concede that this game is absolutely terrible. It's the worst game in my library.If you're interested in playing a turn-based American Football style game, check out Frozen Cortex which is a lot better than this.			",33,14,1,22,26,3,7

												As a table top fan this had some high expectations to live up to. But it's a faithful adaptation of the game and thankfully doesn't try to mess with a winning format. Sure, the interface (especially multiplayer) isn't great and the graphics aren't mind-blowing however, it's highly playable and worth picking up on a special.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I suggest getting this game, but only if you are willing to put effort into reading the rules and looking up stategies and how the mechanics work. Get this game when it is on sale if you love the Warhammer universe and are interested in Blood Bowl.I put a lot of hours into this game, but I have not progressed very far because I keep starting over. This is a very wierd game, turn-based to the core where your fate hides in each roll of the die...or is it?Truth be told I absolutely SUCKED at this game, god awful loss after loss after loss. It wasn't until recently I decided to play the game again, except this time I spent more time reading up on what things meant and some basic strategys. Now my Chaos, Skaven, Orc teams are now winning many games and the die rolls do not seem unfair at all once you know how far to push your luck. Real-time isn't too bad but it isn't really great, I feel it should have been expanded a bit or gutted to focus more on the other parts of the game. Worth a play or two, but it might not hold your attention for long. Do not get this game soely for this feature.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blood Bowl is a faithful transition of the tabletop game to the screen.  This game handles many of the fiddly bits of the tabletop game for you, and is fairly good.  Even for a relative newcomer to the game, it is fairly easy to pick up (unlike the ball) and tends to give you explanations for why things went hilariously wrong.  That said, if you want those explanations you'll have to read the dice log - things aren't handed to you.With a very little bit of offline reading (there are several good sites and Youtube videos which explain the more complicated aspects) you'll have a blast.The game has run pretty stable for me, and I've encountered very few bugs (though there are some graphical glitches I've seen).  There seem to be features that are incompletely implemented, but nothing that has hurt my enjoyment of the game.			",230,64,6,65,41,7,98

												A very good title if you enjoy table top games.There is enough strategy and customization in team setup to keep you interested, and each race and even player within the race offers a good range of depth and diversity.The commentary is witty and will keep you amused even when it repeats a million times. The campaign mode offers nice progression and with player injuries and deaths you constantly have to adjust and manage your team.I have not played much of the online leagues, but the few games I've had were fairly fun. Overall people tend to be friendly and focussed on having fun.Overall a good game. Not for everyone but it is worth a try if you like strategy, tactical gameplay, table top games, or simply enjoy the Warhammer Fantasy universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah... old Gamesworkshop board games. While I wont claim to have played the original boardgame of Bloodbowl, my family does have the original box somewhere in the loft, but let's just talk about this version. This version is great, abit jarring to get into and confusing on what most of the stuff in the game does but once you figure it out then it's a blast to play, all the races you expect to be in a Warhammer game are here, from Halflings to Wood Elves, from the Undead to the Orcs, this game has pretty much most of the races, although both Chaos Dwarves and the Demons of Khorne are missing (They are in the Chaos Edition) In short, this game is worth a try if you're into board games.

												I bought Blood Bowl in a steam sale for just over a fiver. It's great. Very addictive, incredibly deep and just damn good fun. Strategy meets sports in a bloody mixing bowl of legends...or something.Busy online community with loads of leagues for competitive play and a lot of options for building your own team any which way you like to test yourself against coaches form all round europe.Bulging single player with a lot of games and modes and stories and campaigns as well as the multiplayer where you can get a mate round and play hot seat taking turns or go online. This will keep you busy for a while.Love it.			",92,19,4,3,11,1,13

												Never tried the tabletop game before, but fell in love with this straight away. Races play very differently, but still somewhat balanced, a testament to good game mechanics. The slow building up of your team over matches is extremely satisfying! Despite its quirky humour and dependance on dice-rolling, its a fun tactical board game that has lots of depth even as you clock in those hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love games where you dance through laughing and singing, walk slowly away from this game. If you, on the other hand, love games with intense action, nailbiting chance-taking, horrible injuries, death, frustrating adverseries, gore, brink-of-insanity like gameplay, this is definately the game for you.Whether you like to play nimble play through actual tactics and rules, or you love just smashing the brains out of the opponents team and stomp them when they are down, this is as hilariously frustrating as it gets. There are rules to the game, but mostly you really dont have to follow them if you dont want to - you can always bribe the referee so he happens to turn the blind eye when you are jumping on an opponents head. Or you can, you know, not care and just do it anyway.Within the first few games on ""Easy"" difficulty, three of my players had died, two had severe permanent injuries, my team was in ruins, my economy was too low to buy new players and I had lost all my games and most of my sanity due to yet another loss against an all Halfling team. Most games I instantly shift from manic-like laughter when I see another teams player sent to the morgue, to quiet sobbing when I loose my own Star Player due to a broken back.

												I have played Blood Bowl for a couple of decades both on tabletop and on the free alternative to this game.The gameengine is ok - nice graphics - only thing that is REALLY missing is an 2d option.It has a few bugs but they are smaller and fewer than ever.The problem for me is the statistics and the ingame community features are boring and you do not get a feeling of being part of af huge community.(at least the spectate option is there now)There is alot of games where you play someone that obviously has no idea what he/she is doing. It ends up in an extremely onesided match - where more often than not the new player gets either mad and uses profanity or just leaves the game on - for you to wait for the timeout every turn. The other problem is the huge percentage of games where the opponent just quit (without any significant penalty).The game also had an weird priority in which races should be availeble first - but that is history now.I love Blood Bowl in all forms - so I really hope they overhall the commynitypart of the game - and creates something like divisions for coaches. So everybody has to play XXX amout of games in ""the college divisions"" before moving to the ""NFL"".That would give everybody a better experiance - the new coaches would not be preyed upon - and it should result in a higher percentage of close matches.

The campaign and skirmish matches don't have a storyline and fall mainly into a play this to prepare you to play online.If you can find yourself a good group of people to start up your own online Blood Bowl league do so. The game really shines when you have other people to enjoy it with.			",103,32,0,19,6,4,24

												Blood Bowl is a faithful transition of the tabletop game to the screen.  This game handles many of the fiddly bits of the tabletop game for you, and is fairly good.  Even for a relative newcomer to the game, it is fairly easy to pick up (unlike the ball) and tends to give you explanations for why things went hilariously wrong.  That said, if you want those explanations you'll have to read the dice log - things aren't handed to you.With a very little bit of offline reading (there are several good sites and Youtube videos which explain the more complicated aspects) you'll have a blast.The game has run pretty stable for me, and I've encountered very few bugs (though there are some graphical glitches I've seen).  There seem to be features that are incompletely implemented, but nothing that has hurt my enjoyment of the game.			",230,64,6,65,41,7,98

												What can I say sports fans.  If you like your fantasy football to include chainsaw's and throwing team mates, beer and violent fans, then this is the game for you.  Based pretty well on the original board game, it is a solid attempt to recreate the fun of the dice rolling version.  A wide choice of race types, with enough variety to suit almost any style of play.  Several different settings, and fairly straight forward interface.  The way you level up experienced star players allows specialist development, and giving them names of your choice allows you endless oppertunity for self congratulation or giving a friend a ribbing.  For those who remember the original, this will be home sweet home.  For those who don't, welcome to the party.  Get scoring!			",19,3,0,5,4,1,30

												A very good title if you enjoy table top games.There is enough strategy and customization in team setup to keep you interested, and each race and even player within the race offers a good range of depth and diversity.The commentary is witty and will keep you amused even when it repeats a million times. The campaign mode offers nice progression and with player injuries and deaths you constantly have to adjust and manage your team.I have not played much of the online leagues, but the few games I've had were fairly fun. Overall people tend to be friendly and focussed on having fun.Overall a good game. Not for everyone but it is worth a try if you like strategy, tactical gameplay, table top games, or simply enjoy the Warhammer Fantasy universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And, of course, half the point of the game is to beat the living daylights out of the other team and/or kill as many of them as you can before scoring a touchdown.

												This game is just so disappointing.  Clumsy and cluttered UI lead to games being decided by misclicks rather than skill way too often. Lots of bugs that the makers are very slow to fix or even acknowledge. Constant new releases that mean dipping into your pocket once again for an update while they should be working on a lot more basic issues. Some like it,  but for me they don't like BloodBowl by doing so. Looks pretty but you soon get over that and want some substance which just isn't there.

												Ah... old Gamesworkshop board games. While I wont claim to have played the original boardgame of Bloodbowl, my family does have the original box somewhere in the loft, but let's just talk about this version. This version is great, abit jarring to get into and confusing on what most of the stuff in the game does but once you figure it out then it's a blast to play, all the races you expect to be in a Warhammer game are here, from Halflings to Wood Elves, from the Undead to the Orcs, this game has pretty much most of the races, although both Chaos Dwarves and the Demons of Khorne are missing (They are in the Chaos Edition) In short, this game is worth a try if you're into board games.

												I suggest getting this game, but only if you are willing to put effort into reading the rules and looking up stategies and how the mechanics work. Get this game when it is on sale if you love the Warhammer universe and are interested in Blood Bowl.I put a lot of hours into this game, but I have not progressed very far because I keep starting over. This is a very wierd game, turn-based to the core where your fate hides in each roll of the die...or is it?Truth be told I absolutely SUCKED at this game, god awful loss after loss after loss. It wasn't until recently I decided to play the game again, except this time I spent more time reading up on what things meant and some basic strategys. Now my Chaos, Skaven, Orc teams are now winning many games and the die rolls do not seem unfair at all once you know how far to push your luck. Real-time isn't too bad but it isn't really great, I feel it should have been expanded a bit or gutted to focus more on the other parts of the game. Worth a play or two, but it might not hold your attention for long. Do not get this game soely for this feature.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played Blood Bowl for a couple of decades both on tabletop and on the free alternative to this game.The gameengine is ok - nice graphics - only thing that is REALLY missing is an 2d option.It has a few bugs but they are smaller and fewer than ever.The problem for me is the statistics and the ingame community features are boring and you do not get a feeling of being part of af huge community.(at least the spectate option is there now)There is alot of games where you play someone that obviously has no idea what he/she is doing. It ends up in an extremely onesided match - where more often than not the new player gets either mad and uses profanity or just leaves the game on - for you to wait for the timeout every turn. The other problem is the huge percentage of games where the opponent just quit (without any significant penalty).The game also had an weird priority in which races should be availeble first - but that is history now.I love Blood Bowl in all forms - so I really hope they overhall the commynitypart of the game - and creates something like divisions for coaches. So everybody has to play XXX amout of games in ""the college divisions"" before moving to the ""NFL"".That would give everybody a better experiance - the new coaches would not be preyed upon - and it should result in a higher percentage of close matches.

The result of this is that on a good run you kill the opposing players team he has been building for weeks, and on a bad run the team you have been building for weeks is slaughtered...so you will never be able to get any team going you like becuase sooner or later your best players will die.

												The PC version of Blood Bowl is as faithful a conversion of the brilliant Games Workshop board game as you will find. Each match is a tense sequence of tactical gambles, weighing up the odds of success and failure with every move. When played as such the game takes on chess-like properties, mixed with ludicrous victories and face-palming defeats.			",165,41,5,25,33,7,70

												If you never played the tabletop version, you will not understand this game. If you never read the actual copy of the Blood Bowl rulebook, you will not understand this game.  If you think the game is confusing, as stated before you probably never played the board game itself, what can you do to play this game without getting frustrated or write a negative review on it? Get the actual rulebook to this  game from your local comic shop or any game shop that specializes in Roleplaying games, or else you'll never understand the gameplay or the rule concept behind Bloodbowl.  All of the elements of the original boardgame, are compressed into a video game, I have spent a few minutes on it and I understand with just by messing with the tutorial.  Again, read the rulebook, it's in the game where you start the tutorial, download the pdf version, or get the actual board game. Or else, you won't get it at all even with played tutorial, and I know people these days don't even bother read anymore.Overall, with time and practice, it can be a very very fun game and a real blast with friends.

												The classic mode is just like the board game, since it essentially is the board game. Having AI opponents is great for when you want to learn how to play and get through a campaign relatively quickly.Since it's based on an already awesome game, I fully recommend this to anyone who likes turn-based RPG-style board games about fake sports in which players are routinely crippled or killed.

												I actually hate this game, due its dull, repetitive, non-sensical and completely dissimilar play/combat style which does not fit in with the Warhammer world in the slightest. Bloodbowl my♥♥♥♥♥However, I am going to recommend this game in the hope that others make the same mistake that I did and buy it, so that I won't be alone in my disappointment and can whine aimlessly to somebody who cares just a tiny bit.

												Ok so this is a great game, could try and explain why but Sport, fantasy, turn based strategy, mayhem, injuries and comedy sounds bleh... However it is fun and a highly complex game with many layers and offers every playstyle and playing mode possible.Plus it has semi naked cheerleaders.....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												American football in the Warhammer universe with a mix of Speedball thrown in. Good times.Shame the game crashes so often making it unplayable and there is no tech support at all.  Game dev screwing the gamer again.			",201,26,1,51,12,4,58

												I'm not a fan of american football, but this game surely has a lot of interesting feats to it. Both the real time as the turn-based gameplay options offer a lot of fun and skill to play, matches are fun yet challenging. Game progress is at a correct speed so you won't have an overpowered team early, yet face a little more powerful teams constantly, offering little space for error and requiring time and practice.

												So I picked this game up for ten dollars. Was it worth it? I don't know. It plays like chess, only it's not chess. I feel like this game could be so much more if so many things weren't contingent on dice rolling. It's like I'm playing some Final Fantasy Tactics board game and every so often my nephew walks by, kicks the pieces off the board, and then everyone and everything is ♥♥♥♥ed. Just ♥♥♥♥ed.7/10			",215,28,0,33,6,1,21

												This game is a really good turn-based strategy game. While the voices do eventually get repetitive, they're acceptable enough, and the ""classic"" game mode is everything you could want it to be. The player experience is even more interesting, making team values and handicaps something to actually consider in a real multiplayer season. Check it out			",325,66,9,31,42,5,65

												Great game for those without the time to get into the tabletop version as all dice rolls are sorted out for you. The single player mode is a little lacking but multiplayer more than makes up for it!			",18,3,0,7,0,2,9
