												The store page description and screenshots only show a small part of the game.  Each Westward game prunes away the repetive aspects of the previous one.  The player can control any ""good"" character; it's just that your main character is the most versatile.  Most towns start from scratch.  You build several.  There is a ""world map"" where you travel from town to town.  The world map is also used to move to the next challenge the player unlocks.  It is almost like Sid Meier's Railroads and Dragon Warrior VII had a child.			",8,6,0,4,20,0,38

												This is a surprisingly solid little game just don't expect the biggest and baddest anything.  There is nothing complex about this game and can almost feel a little slow at times but overall it's a great little time waster that scratches an itch most people don't realize they have until they've played a game like this.  The controls are extremely simple but get the job done. The story is an after thought but the but overall has character.  Simple yet still enough to keep the game flowing with just dropping commands on you to complete.Pick it up when it's on sale and give it a go, you could do a whole lot worse for a couple bucks.

												This casual game is a lot more polished, better designed, and deeper than a lot of strategy games that aren't.  You might expect a light and simple game that you can play through in just two or four hours, but that's not Westward IV.  As the final chapter of a strong series, it has developed to a point of balance.  You need to balance the normal stuff - getting certain base goods like wood and coal, and then build various buildings.  But there is one huge base map that you explore and build off of for the whole game, but then you have to build your railroad in another city or fight off bandits on some other map, so you have these short scenarios mixed in with the various objectives on your main map. It's an extremely well detailed game, and one that is really fleshed out.  Many casual strategy games have just a handful of buildings, decorations, and such.  Just enough to wet your whistle.  Not so here.   Here you have a very fleshed out economy.  And if you explore maps you'll find side quests, and unlock secret plants for your farms or animals for your ranches.  I put around 20-25 hours into my first play through the game.  That's worth it.It's a casual game that can certainly be played as such, but it also transcends the genre in many ways as well.  I stand by how good it is. ",73,58,2,65,49,9,71

												One of the best casual-strategy game I've ever played, the pure childhood.I'm still having lot of fun with this game even though I haven't finish the game yet since I was childhood. (Gonna do it now!)If you're thinking that this game will be so short as the casual name says it, you're damn wrong!Very shame that the series's dev is gone and no more sequel as far as I know. Plus this game is way underrated than anything else. :\			",96,14,1,8,17,1,3
