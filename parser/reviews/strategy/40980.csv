												This game is probably the strongest of the newer strongholds but still has some problems. If you're into RTS games that are fairly simple give this one a look. There's a wide variety of units with three different fantasy factions to choose from and each has a unique playstyle with their own strengths and weaknesses.ALSO HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥FREE UPGRADE TO STEAM VERSION FOR ANYONE WHO HAD THIS PREVIOUSLY GOOD JOB FIREFLY I SORT OF FORGIVE YOU FOR MAKING A 5/10 SHC2 THAT REALLY STILL NEEDS PATCHING AND OPTIMIZATION			",41,4,0,11,12,1,7

												So after 7 years of the game being released and me owning it on steam as part of the stronghold bundle they did for something like 2-3 years i always wondered how such a great game wasnt supported individually. Well as i was just logging on to my pc about to sit down to playing some of this i get a little update message and i nearly broke my chair i sat up so fast. This is an absolute star in the stronghold series and I dont see how it got the hate it did on its first release. A+++ support firefly/steam you've made my month. 11/10			",6,3,0,4,11,0,5

												My favorite SH game tied with Crusader 1. It got a lot of hate on release, but I really enjoyed the vast array of new troops, and the diffent building styles based on the factions. Also loved the feature where you could turn all your peasants into troops with 1 click (as opposed to clicking 24 times to make 24 troops...). This game is a lot more combat-centric than the previous SH games, but given the huge selection of interesting troops to use, I can hardly knock it for that.Beyond shocked to see this given a proper Steam release WITH Steam multiplayer, achievements, workshop support, etc. Thank you FireFly! Here's to hoping they update the other games as well!			",122,20,0,13,15,0,28

												So if Steam logged all the time I had playing this game on the Disc, I would legit have over a couple thousand hours. This game was my childhood, and a few years ago I convinced my friends to play the multiplayer with me. Once we were finally all into it and knew the mechanics, they closed the multiplayer servers not two months later. Devestated, I still played through all the single player modes, but I did so long for the multiplayer back. But, Steam delivered, and upgraded the game to the Steam edition, reviving the community for the game and allowing us to play multiplayer again (While adding a few new cool features! Workshop is so nice). While my friends and I (Sadly) don't play this game as much currently, as League of Legends has consumed our lives, whenever we get bored, or when I'm feeling in a particularly mediaval mood, this is always the first game I turn to, as every time I play it I am filled with that sense of nastolgia, and am able to relax to the nice sounds of my catapults tearing down my enemy's walls.

												First of all, i am really surprised that my precious game got updated with all this. After 7 years that is. But it's still awesome. It felt so refreshing after all that Crusader 2 and SH3. ( boi how dissapointing they were. ) It's really great seeing this game back, which was cursed in the released times, i loved it back then, i still love it.For the folk who didn't play it yet, and is curious how good this game is +One of the greatest unit designs SH series have ever done.+Multiple strategic factions. They all have their own way to win. And own way to lose. +""A fantasy SH? WHY?"" you might say as i did when it came out but to be honest firefly really did manage to fit fantasy world into this, It's so much fun to use different kind of monsters to siege over the walls and stuff. +For the first ♥♥♥♥ing time, oxs carry the iron, not some peasent, doing it one by one. *sigh* +Some of the soundtracks ( especially ice land theme ) is pretty mind consumingBUT; there is still a huge optimisation problem wtih win7 and upper of it. If the screen has more than 100 units, the fps will drop insanely, in a really annoying level. -The swordmen and pikemen are no longer that resistant to arrows ( ofcourse still resistant just not the old way ), it took 30 archers to do it in a quick way in the older games, now it seems easier. I don't feel forced to recruit crossbowmen anymore.-The graphics are a bit  extra eye tiring. -Rushing witches are a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥			",79,20,0,18,12,0,17

												Stronghold Legends is a great RTS game. After finishing its singleplayer campaign. You can join a fast paced multiplayer lobby. The game features three factions, each with unique units based on their theme. The goal is to essientialy decimate your enemies lord whilest defending your own. while doing so you can create structures and fortifications, since the units vary and can be countered you can experience a extremly dynamic game. The game itself is very simple for beginners in comparison with a hardcore RTS like the wargame franchise. Sadly the amount of players is extremly limited and playing alone is quite bland, so if you have a friend who you enjoy playing with, I would definitely recommend it, seeing as playing skirmishes against bots is as satisfying as winning against players. In conclusion I recommend it for RTS fans who want to get one of the best stronghold franchise games. I rate this game a 7/10. Since it gets quite repetive and if you dont have anyone to play with playing multiplayer is overall tricky, since fewer and fewer people play this game worldwide.			",61,10,2,4,14,2,11

												Great game. Will defiantly play a bit more now that its been updated. Can't wait for similar support to come to Stronghold 2.Edit:As for the steam upgrade, it doesnt look like they did anything to the game itself, which is sorta disappointing. And on top of that, now I have problems launching the game (it won't unless I run it as an admin), and it crashes constantly. It also has some optimization problems, where even on lowest settings if a game drags on frames drop like crazy. Also, sometimes when I try to set the game to certain resolutions, it won't start. Of course, these problems with the game starting might just be on Win 10's part, because it is awful. Its a good game, but jank as hell... Which I always found strange, since Stronghold 2 came out before this, and that game's way more polished. Still can't wait for that one to get its update.			",130,21,0,19,13,0,10

												Although it lists me as playing for a mere twelve hours as of this review, I've actually played this game a long time ago, and quite a bit, in all honesty. The game is solid in terms of a Stronghold game (which isn't saying much), but I do have a few problems. Pros- Pretty Decent Graphics for a game released in the early 2000s- The economy system, while much more simple than other games, is still very important in Legends- The Three Factions are surprisingly similar in playstyle, but with just enough differences to make them unique. For example, the Good Side has more emphasis on hero powers than the other factions.- There are three campaigns, each of which provide their own curving difficulty- Dragons. No explaination neededCons- Legends doesn't have a Free-Build Mode, like in previous games.- Multiplayer is 4 player only. Other games in the series have 8 Player multiplayer.- Despite the Combat being much more streamlined and varied, the economy aspect is a downgrade from Stronghold 2's economy. This is all about taste, and, for some, this would be perfectly fine.- The Mythical Units of Legends are powerful, but they really don't change the game all that much. Even the Dragons don't really change the game enough...VerdictThe game is flawed, but so is the rest of the series. If you like deep Castle Sim gameplay, Stronghold 2, to be blunt, is a far better choice. However, I would still recommend Legends, despite its flaws. The game, although it pales in comparison to its predecesor, has enough differences and improvements to warrent at least an hour or two of playtime, at least. If anything, just play the game for the campaign, because even the good side (the easiest) is pretty difficult at the end.Also, this game has dragons, so dragon fans are going to be happy, even if they don't last that long.

												Stronghold Legends has great medieval sights and sounds...esp the music. Totally fitting for the period. The gameplay? Well, I've played every other Stronghold game and the learning curve was gradual and reasonable. In Legends, when I play a skirmish (and to a lesser extent, the campaign) by the time I have begun to put out some archers on my very basic single walls all is lost when enemy catapults show up along with gangs of archers...and this is only five minutes into the game. AND, it's on baby-level easy difficulty! The balance between me and the AI limits my  games to about 20 minutes...no casual planning and admiring your castle that you worked so hard to  build, the enemy will show up when you are a quarter/halfway into your building and, from there, it's a frenetic battle that leaves little time for me to enjoy the game..I spend the time putting out fires. Maybe it's me, but I've completed Stronghold where the difficulty was gradually increased. Legends has me feeling so incompetent it's maddening. These are my major gripes, though....if the AI didn't have all their stuff researched and produced at warp speed, this would be one of my top ten games. I still recommend it, though...a Monarch should be proud, but not SO proud that he dismisses, outright, any incompetent behaviour on his part. No, no...a great leader is more realistic and contemplates his incompetence and, thus, can learn from it.In my opinion, the pro's outweigh the cons.			",232,30,34,45,71,3,95

												This is still my favourite Stronghold game to play. Combat is more fun and interesting than other Stronghold games due to the added fantasy units, allowing for much more fun when besieging and defending your castle. The multiplayer is now working again which is great but I am getting occasional crashes back to the main menu during games, which is highly annoying!!

												i would recommend this game if you love others stronghold games, i mostly played stronghold crusader and so it's a bit weird to see this kind of animation of game, which is cool and i like to play everyone single one these stronghold games even if it's bad because the 1st game i loved was stronghold crusader which i played #alsorecommended			",40,9,0,6,12,0,5

												This game looks like loads of fun, it really does. The controls and getting use to how it works with building and managing taxes and such take a small amount of time to learn and are fairly easy to master. The graphics are fine for it, when you get the setting right for the game to even load up. This game has a severe issue with any oporating system windows xp and newer. It constantly crashes, freezes up, or gets stuck allowing you to pan around but not select anything while bandits beat the hell out of your piddly structures and men. The main issue with this game is that it is nearly unplayable at all. Forget multiplayer as well, it will crash, freeze, or just take a memory dump on you. Using anything above the lowest setting usually causes the game to crash. This game triggers multiple virus warnings on avast and maleware warnings on malwarebytes. Even after adding it to the exception lists however, as per the companies pitiful bit of support topics, it resolves no issues and the game still doesn't work. Forget about game support as well, the company that made it doesn't respond to queries. It could be an awesomely fun game, if it worked.			",105,16,0,28,18,0,29

												An amazing RPG/Strategy/RTS game. Not nearly as amazing as Stronghold 2, which is what introduced me to the series, but still a good game. If your looking for a more focused and more legititmate Castle Sim then go to Stronghold 2. Legends focuses more on the RTS side of things, which is why their are rediculous units compared to the other titles. It does provide some Castle Sim, but not nearly as much as Stronghold 2 required. So if you don't like micro-managing a town while fighting another lord, then this is your game. But, if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 it would definitely be a solid 7.5. It's not quite there, but it's more there than Stronghold 3  and Crusader 2.			",128,7,1,15,22,1,11

												Wahoo! Just got the Steam Edition of this game and I CANNOT WAIT to delve into it :D Currently eating though so it's gonna have to wait at least 20 minutes or so..Stronghold Legends is a MUST HAVE for any RTS fan - This is by far one of my most favourite, alongside Anno 2070 I think, and massively beats Stronghold 3 hands down (Stronghold 3 was a serious letdown).I can't comment on the 'remastered' version as haven't played that yet, but in general the games graphics are old, but that doesn't stop the game being amazing fun! Now with workshop support, achievements and multiplayer?! Yeeaaaahhhhh let good times commence all over again :D Highly recommend!11/10 - One of the games of my life.			",93,18,7,16,24,1,15

												Sometimes when I'm getting wrecked like Haldir in the Two Towers I ask myself, ""Do I suck, or did anyone play test this stuff?""*See video for accurate portrayal of my defeat.*


YouTube™ Video: Haldir Death Scene 

			Views: 1,776		

			Scene from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002).		

*Now watch it 20 times in a row to feel like me after trying the same mission 20 times.*It keeps me up at night, bro.BUT HEY! YOU CAN BE DRACULA AND SUMMON DRAGONS. Not many games can boast that. So I got that going for me... which is nice. All in all, Stronghold Legends is OK. It's not the greatest RTS out there. I mean REALLY not. The original is a classic, and it has its design quirks too. In some ways though I feel like Legends takes a few steps backward from its predecessor, i.e. there are inuitive design features I feel like I need that are missing. Stuff you would expect out of an RTS from 2006.There are also a smaller variety of units (unless you get characters), and a smaller variety of buildings, which is disappointing. Again, if you want something more in depth, a true castle simulator, then you'll want the original Stronghold. It's sad to say, but it's very true. The game has a lot of character and flair I do respect. Every mission has a voiceover and artwork I love. The problem is that the actual gameplay is missing any of its character. Try as I might, I can not recommend this game. That hurts because Stronghold was my first computer game with my buddy. I wanna like this game, I do, but it's severely underbaked, and after my short time with it, I feel like I've seen all it has to offer. Sorry Stronghold. I do love you guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My Thoughts on Stronghold Legends....Dear Fire Fly Studios, You have built a great empire with stronghold but it has begun to crumble with each game.You made Crusader…. A decent game with some new things tacked on.Then you made the graphically superior Stronghold 2.Now I had my issues with some of these…. However Stronghold Legends was not only a fail In RTS terms (balance) it was a fail in Simulation terms. That is all of it in a nutshell. (In short)Wait! You’re still reading? Well then I’ll list the good and bad things then.PROSSimple RTS gameplay that has some great value to it like the “spam and rush” type gameplay.The campaign is great! The story follows King Arthur (the good guy), Vlad the Impaler (the bad guy), and much more.Strongholds original soundtrack will always have a good place in my heart.The Steam Workshop maps and mappers.CONSFrost Giants is how you win in multiplayer.Bats are how you win in multiplayer.Knights are how you win in multiplayer.Siege Towers with Crossbowmen on them is how you win in multiplayer.All of the CONS I just listed also apply to singleplayer.SPAM! SPAM! SPAM!ALL OTHER UNITS ARE ALMOST USELESS.Lack of Simulation makes everything Stronghold was….Gone!STRONGHOLD LEGENDS HAS STOPPED WORKING!This game goes so fast that the economy barley exists! (Compared with the older games that is)Final thoughts this game It can still be fun….but with so many problems what can one do?Remaster it and not fix the bugs?AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!LinksNewave will still play this game however I will not recommend it to poor helpless people who don’t know what they are getting themselves in.As these are my thoughts and not others this is how I experienced this game. Yours may be different.			",68,8,0,26,9,0,12

												TLDR: Buy it if you want to know how cool it's to build your Stronghold in glorious 3DDont if you cant stand bugs and stupid stupid stupid AI And this is my rant!So I got the Stronghold bundle long ago but never touches any of it more than 1hrs, i just want to feel the nostalgia on steam. Hundreds of hrs was poured into SHC non-steam though. And then suddenly we got this Stronghold Legend Steam Edition. Let me make this clear:I love Stronghold, I went out to buy Stronghold Crusader 1 day after i tried Stronghold.Stronghold 2 was 3d but the gameplay and engine was pure trash.Then we got Stronghold 3 and Crusader 2 using new engine  with Havok physic for more flashy sieges but those game are not Stronghold.Back a bit to the Original Stronghold Legend. It was the one that stick 80% true to the original game. 20% was the fantasy stuff that annoy the hell out of me. Still when you considering a Stronghold remaster, this one fits the bill. About the game:The graphic is pretty much the same (to me, still meh) The rest you can gather from the store page, they are there.But How the hell, can they break THE GAME. It's already broken when they made it and somehow they manages to break somemore!!!!!!!Play the 1st act of the campaign.................you will notice........when your troops walk, clanking those shiny armours with annoying sounds. And somehow, when they stop, those sounds goes on for 5-10 secs. It's like after they stopped their balls still have some momentum left and keep dangling inside their armour, making those clanking sound.I remember archers can shoot from the ground to kill the guy on the wall and yet in this version, somehow, they cant and what i got is 1 guy left on the wall who manages to snipe down my 40+ archers. REMASTER ? REALLLY ? MORE LIKE ""HEY GIV US $$$ AND WE WILL HELP PUT ANOTHER NAIL IN THE STRONGHOLD COFFIN FOR YA""Did i mentioned the game crash when i try Skirmish ?And did i mentioned the game load long as hell ? Like Vlad was doing some dirty thing in the background preventing me to load the game. Even Total War Warhammer loads quicker than this!!!!Please Firefly, make a decent Stronghold like the ones in 2001 and 2002 please. Your latest game is 5$ DIRT CHEAP ON HUMBLE BUNDLE.

												While this may be a good game, I can't get it to run. The farthest I can get is the initial loading screen, where the loading bar fills up most the way then the game decides to stop working. Windows 10 Asus UX305F laptop. I've attemped default recommended settings, the ""low"" setting, windowed mode, launching as administrator, with compatibility mode for Win7... I've gone through the gauntlet with no success.I appreciate them giving this out to current owners, but hopefully they plan make it playable to those that shouldn't have an issue.

												The stronghold games never seem to innovate and really get better and this is the same.  There is little shake up here with the same tiredsome formula that the games franchise have been doing all along. The food production buildings industry, unts, etc, aren't much different to past ones. There ARE differences (I can't recall if the older ones been multiplayer, but I've got little interest in multiplayer it). If your hoping for something new out of the series...Nah.  Better graphics... More voices... A few dragons... Magic.  But its the same old game underneath.			",111,36,4,62,48,1,41

												Game:Dear Firefly, you are still a One Hit Wonder. This game just shows how hard firefly is trying to bring back the Stronghold Hype. The first Stronghold + Stronghold Crusader (Which is pretty much the same) were awesome but every game after this was like much worse. Maybe Stronghold: Legends would not be a bad game if you wouldn't compare it to the older Stronghold Games but sience these are cheaper and a lot better why you should buy this?Steam Version:The perfomance is just completly bad for what you get. Graphics are pretty decent, not ugly or something but the perfomance is just super bad. I run between 30-50FPS with a GTX 770 and a i5-4460@3.2GhZ.

												I wish I could actually have something to say about the game, but I can't because the graphics and frame rate are so bad it makes it impossible to play.  My hardward is up to date and can run whatever mainstream game I want, usually on high or ultra, but for some reason this game plays at 2 frames a minute. There was a fix I found to shorten the draw distance and some other things which helped once, but having to do that each time I open the game is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and even that doesn't work all the time.  I was really looking forward to this game, too.			",6,0,0,2,2,0,1
