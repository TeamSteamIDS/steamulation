												Whoa! Let this be a lesson to any other devs who want to ship a poopy port. Put a bit of love and elbow grease into it, and holy crap, the magic you can do. Awesome job guys. I don't think its too little too late, I think its a good job for a great game, and I appreciate your effort. Everyone deserves to play Munch, the way it was meant to be, and now they can.

												OddWorld: Munch's Oddysee is an under appretiated masterpeice. With wonderfully designed characters, an awesome soundtrack, hillarious and strong story, strategy, action, and good old platforming, it is a game beyond compare. It also provides plenty of backstory, so you don't even have to had played the other games. And for only $5.00? Get out your moolah and buy this game now!Abe is a hero among his people after destroying Rupture Farms and Soul Storm Brewery. He has saved a great many of his Mudoken freinds from being turned into lunch and tricked into slavery, but he always knew there were more of his brothers out there. Munch is a Gabbit who has lost his people. After the Glukons, those who were behind Rupture Farms and Soul Storm Brewery, used nets to capture all of the Gabbits from the ocean, Munch has been left alone without any hope of seeing another of his kind again. But together, with their psychic abilities, they will bring down the Glukons and Vyykers Labs once and for all, and get the last can of Gabbit Eggs to save Munch's race. But not without saving the Mudokens and the Fuzzles of course!Some people critisize this game because of it being a port, but I think there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of the controls, graphics, or anything whatsoever. This game is a purchase you will not regret, and I also recommend the others in the series as well.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much as I have read on here that people have had bugs with the game, I hate to say that the Pc port works fine for me, I grew up with this game and I'm glad I can expereince it on Pc, since I don't own the original Xbox copy anymore.Simple, fun, easy to pick up fun for £3.99, some may see it as linear, I see it as uniqueThe one problem I have is the Keyboard control, I personally recommend changing the controls if you plan on using the Keyboard.Also would like an HD update soon or enough, so for that I rate this 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Your scrolling through the Steam reviews in order to determine whether to purchase this game. You see a lot of reviews saying that this game is unplayable and is a waste of money and this once was the case, however, not anymore... The devolpers of this game announced that they are fixing it, and making it into ""Munch HD"" with updated textures and a proper working port. I have tried these updates and they seem to fix all the issues (crashing to desktop, not launching and generally slow) These updates are currently only available if you enable ""beta updates"".To get these updates for yourself, right click on Oddworld Munches Oddysee, then click properties. On the propeties box, click on the betas tab. You should see ""select the beta you would like to opt into"". Click the dropdown box and select ""beta"". Steam should then download an update for Munche's Oddysee. As I said, I have done this and this has seemed to fix all the issues and has made it playable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally played this game on the Xbox as a 4 year old. Over 13 years later the game is still just as fun and has lost none of the replayability value. The gameplay has a good dynamic to it, retaining some of the aspects of the Abe's Oddysee games (such as being able to tell the mudokons what to do and have them follow you around) but also introducing several new gameplay mechanics with Munch. Each level is a puzzle; it can take tens of tries to complete a level, but it is extremely rewarding when you do - and more so when you save as many of your allies as possible. The game ending rewards you for saving the mudokons and fuzzles so I'd encourage you to try your best to do so!The game is a bit awkward to control with a keyboard due to the turning mechanic and I didn't find it easy to adjust the controls to fix this so I'd recommend buying a controller to play this game with (the game was designed to play on an Xbox controller, and works find with a USB Xbox 360 controller, and others may work too). The gameplay is smooth and surprisingly polished for a console port. I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you have the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I purchased this with the oddbox I was extremely excited to be able to finally play this on pc, huge fan of Abes odysee! Then I was completely dissapointed with the crap that was Munch's Odysee on pc. The port was utter rubbish.NOW however, thanks to hard working programmers and smart people types, it's been fixed! After a good year or two, I decided to boot the game back up to have a look at what had been done and wow, it's great! Ok, it's not a perfect game but its a fricken hell of a lot better than the steaming turd pile it was when I first purchased it. I think now, it's a game that I'll happily add to my...umm........backlog....But yes, It's certainly good!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Munch's Oddysee port for PC has had its share of problems in the past, but recently Oddworld Inhabitants released a brand new port of the game. Most, if not all of the previous problems have been fixed and the game runs beautifully on Windows 10 over the Steam Link. While the game indicates it has only limited controller support, I have had 0 issues playing this game with an Xbox 360 controller.In addition to playability fixes they have updated many of the graphics and models. The game still doesn't look truly 'high-res' by any standard, but it's enough of an upgrade to make this 15 year old game a bit more pleasing to the eyes. The audio has had a makeover as well,  removing almost every instance of the cartoony (and highly annoying) sound effects that were present in the original game. They have been replaced with much better sounding, non cartoony alternatives. Hopping around with Munch and a bunch of Fuzzles has never sounded so relatively calming, let me tell you.GameplayThe gameplay has obviously not changed at all. In all fairness, Munch's Oddysee was never the shining pinacle of amazing gameplay. It had its fair share of issues on the Xbox and those issues still exist today. The camera can be highly annoying at times, controls are sometimes really twitchy and the design of certain levels leaves much to be desired. Some of the objectives in a level are very repetitive (Egg Crates, anyone?).Out of the original 4 Oddworld games Munch's Oddysee is generally regarded as the worst one, deservingly so. However, that doesn't mean the game isn't enjoyable. It has its fun moments, an interesting story and considering the game is 15 years old it does deserve a little slack.The game costs 5 dollars as it is, it's regularly on sale and comes as part of the Oddbox as well. And if you don't own any Oddworld games the Oddbox is what you should be buying anyway. Either way I would recommend this game to anyone who likes (old) 3D platformers, even if it hasn't aged greatly in some areas.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 If you're considering buying this game on its own and haven't played it before, I suggest you avoid it.  I had played and loved the first two Oddworld games on PS1 and I was excited to pick up the Oddbox while it was on sale.  Given the amount I paid for the bundle, it was well worth the cost.  The camera controls for this game make it a huge pain to play.  If you're using keyboard and mouse, the mouse is supposed to move the camera.  In my experience, it only moves the screen such minute amounts that it is barely noticeable and instead, the Function keys (F1. F2. etc) have to be used instead.  If you have an XBOX360 controller plugged in, the camera controls are hard-mapped to the D-Pad.  SERIOUSLY?!  Sure, back when this clunky 3D game came out, camera controls were notorious for being bad, but we should be able to switch the setting so that the camera is controlled by trigger buttons or the right stick.I tried to give the game a serious try, but after an hour I've given up.  Once platforming gets more difficult in the game, it's going to be impossible to play effectively.			",196,28,9,16,15,0,11

												To start off I would like to say that I am completely biased towards this game.  I used to play Munch's Oddysee all the time, when I was kid, on the original xbox.  The emulated version of it on the 360 made it impossible to hear anything.  So when I found out that not only did they add both the PS1 games and Munch's Oddysee I was excited.  From all of the other reviews they were mentioning things that I've somewhat experienced like crashing and bad camera controls.  On the crashing side, i'm pretty sure they fixed the starting crash that I experienced when this was first released back in like 2013 or somewhere.  When it comes to the camera side, I have no issues with it whatso ever.   Maybe I was already used to bad camera controls or what but I didn't really notice it.  I first played this game with the 360 controller and had no issues with it.  Then later on I copied the game to a USB which I would play during class using only mouse and keyboard.  For anyone who wants a single player puzzle game with a weird twist on lore, this is your game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been an Oddworld fan since childhood, and started Munch's Oddysee with enthusiasm, only to be disappointed on the first moments. This is not just a bad Oddworld game, it is a bad game in itself, for any kind of player.There were the usual intro cinematics, for the title screen and for the game itself, as good as always, with that familiar feel and style. The creepy design of the creatures, the dark mood of the plot, the toilet humor, everything was fine. Then, inside that cave where we start playing and learn the commands, I press the jump button and Abe springs cartoonishly on the air in an instant making a muffled ""boing"" sound. This is the condensation of the main flaw of this game, it is too goofy for what it tries to do, with almost no sense of menace.When I played Abe's Exoddus, I loved its unique style, gameplay and personality. I was scared by its mood, challenged by the threats, amazed by the crafstmanship of the design, animations and backgrounds. The humor balanced well the overall tone of the early Oddworld games, and I assume every fan will agree that these traits were their main qualities and the soul of the franchise. Munch's Oddysee took the challenge of taking it to the new generation, but did not make it successfully.It's understandable how the early formula would not translate to 3D, but what formula does this game adopts then? A generic platformer not unlike many others from the Nintendo 64 era, with bland gameplay and with every of the characteristic Oddworld traits either absent or toned down. For example, in the early games, it was amazing how the characters moved in a very organic, realistic way. Abe jumped a small height upstraight, runned smoothly, and climbed ledges with effort. In Munch's Oddysee, he moves like a bad version of Mario or Megaman, severely breaking the gritty feel we all love so much.The level design was very rich and pleasant, with that Ridley Scot Alien vibe on some environments, and a fantasy native vibe on others. Here, the backgrounds are very basic and unpolished. The first level, for example, wich is a set of woods, fades into a fog at a short distance. None of that huge constructions, ruins and statues on the background are to be found. None of those rich details like the coccons with skeletons on the walls of Necrum, or the structures os Monsaic Lines also. The industrial levels are as generic as they can be.The gameplay is, probably, the worst part, because it really strays off the spirit this game tries to convey.First, now everything you do depends on these bright green balls you collect on your path, from the possession powers to opening doors. Yes, bright collectible itens inside an Oddworld game. It's a really clunky way to limit your possession powers and it just does not fit well on this fictional universe. Instead of sneaking your way to sabotage some machine or find some lever or control pad, you walk through an obvious trail of globs and chant to a door when you have gathered enough.Second, the enemies. In the early games, you were almost completely helpless for 99% of the time, and almost everything could kill you instantly, because there was no lifebar. Guards, wildlife, machines, everything was either a monster or a murderer, and you were just this malnourished running slave with near zero fighting capabilities. Then, the emphasis was on stealth, puzzle solving and occasional ofense when the circumstamces allowed. In this game, there is a lifebar, wich means many of those old enemies are now much less of a threat. The sligs, slogs and scrabs don't scare anymore. You end up runnig past many of them just because you don't have the patience to deal with them, not because it's your only option.There is also a combat system. You still interact with characters like in the old games, but instead of them being more helpless than you, needing nothing but rescue, now they can fight for you, weather you play as Abe or Munch, and is really disappointing to see an unarmed slig being slapped to death by a mob of wisecrack mudokons. The vikker interns being eaten by fuzzles are just a little better. In the end, it is just too silly and you don't feel any menace or urgency, which means that killing the enemies is not very satisfying, so the combat gets repetitive and boring.Storytelling was always simple in Odworld, but the franchise tries to create this epic universe, which Munch's Oddysee tries to expand, and such would require more thought through. The plot then just throw events out of nowhere, leaves many things unexplained, and doesn't really know how to pull off its ambitions.Certain franchises just do not make good transitions to newer game designs, but on top of that Munch's Oddysee makes many bad decisions that undermine all the key features of its legacy, specially the dark, menacing setting. This leaves the humor unbalanced and the overall mood uncharacteristic of the franchise's style. But, as a standalone game, this is also a poor effort, with not many good points to make it a fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What I liked about this game:-It bring me my child memories.-Theres updated graphics-Controller Support-60 FPS-a new walk & Sprint mechanic (slow down when I need to take things slow so I dont run into mines but speed up when running from those sligs)50-50-new sounds (quiets down some loud sounds that gave me jumpscares in my childhood but it doesnt bring back the nostalgia without old sounds)What I Didnt like about this game:-Non Dynamic Background music (Unlike the Xbox version where the more happens the more intense the music is)-Music is much more slower than Before-Some glitches here & there, such as inability to free some Fuzzles-addition to the Jumping ability (makes me jump foward instead of straight upwards which makes me ricochet off walls & Ledges into Aqua Mines as Munch)- The dumb down of the shocking ability (have to face the enemies when Shocking which makes me focus on 1 guy while im being attacked by 2 more)- Some cutscenes are in lower resolution & audio is lower quality than others-Not enough Abe nor Munch to keep me Odd.What Does it need:- More time to fix a few bugs and patch a few features. not a whole lot, just about 2 or 3.- A controller loadout (such as the Southpaw/Default settings) or a way to bind keys together- A way to change sounds, not just a soundpack but some options to change sounds such as: old Munch walking sounds or new? old Vykker Intern sounds or New? old explosion sounds or new?Do I recomend this game. Yes for those who want to relive their childhood and for those who want to try something newNo for those who wanted to hardcore this and speedrun without helping the ones in need. you will regret the ending you face. Take time and rescue those who need it, it will save you in the long run. a change in fate shows true Masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although a pretty good game, I find this to be the weakest game in the series. Being able to command Mudoken warriors to fight back is a huge plus but overall it lacks the Grim depressing feel of the previous games that I feel made Oddworld so unique. Munch's oddysee almost feels a little kid friendly in comparrisson.Still its a fun game, definately worth buying the Oddworld Box Set.			",176,113,0,75,35,0,95

												 Don't be put off by all the negative reviews, some work has been done on this game.I'm not gonna review the game itself, by now anybody who's interested in playing this ""Odd"" game probably played it back on the OG Xbox. Let's just say it's as fun as it was back then and the artistic direction is as weird and fantastic as it looked backed then.Now, the port itself. Finally, we have a playable, bug-free, controller-supported port of Munch's Oddyssey. After having the old port refunded about a year ago, I bought it again to see if the new port was any better and thank the developpers, it's MUCH better than the last port. The controls respond well with my DS3 controller and I assume the same goes for Xbox controllers. The graphics are okay, helped with some HD assets but the strange beauty that emanates from the characters and creatures makes the dated graphics forgivable. It also runs well, getting stable 60 FPS shouldn't be a problem even on low-end systems. Overall, a great working product, a classic that finally got the treatment it deserved.Now, I'm a simple man to please and I don't have much to complain about, except the lack of graphical options. Though it may not be necessary to tweak this game as much as modern, more demanding games, it would still have been nice to at least be able to choose resolution because though the games looks and play really well, some people might want the original resolution since the cinematics have been stretched and they look pixellated. I would've liked having an option to have original resolution cutscenes and higher resolution gameplay. But this is really my only complain, the games looks good and plays well, that's what matters with such a classic. Easily one of the reasons I loved my original Xbox so much.At the time of purchase, I paid  C$ 1.37 for this great game and the normal price is C$ 5.49 as of July 26th 2016. At this price, unless you're on a very tight budget, you have no reason to buy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After 6 long years of waiting lorne finds himself perplexed as his eyes scan the horizon of his designer scenic view apartment.The edges were made of glass trees, drained from a night of celebatory escapades and indulgence.He knew the pounding throbbing sensation that slips over mind, it was a feeling he had come to be familiar with but this was something different.Something, Real.Lorne clambers along countless kitchen tiles bone and flesh slapping with every pivot of his elbows.""What could it be? I have everything and yet I feel so empty."" He thought to himself as he bumped what was left of residue on the counter from his journeys into the other realm.He had fought with lizards before, infact ever since he could remember, he had suffered the scorn of the lizard people.His mind began to race as his pent up insecurities unbuckled from their fasten, he knew they would be coming, it was only a matter of time before the secret council would picture frame my deeds, and they would be hungry.He couldnt hold it in anymore.The main course lobster had become a stewing mucus of acid and flem as it fountained from his mouth soaking his work desk in pretty yellow dough.""Ive gotta do something now, I cant let these godamn reptiles beat me!"" He knew what had to be done, the guilt had rolled over his chest like a 4x4.He reached over opening his side drawer to reveal a single grease stained notebook and a small tube of pre-prohibition Quaaludes.Lorne lay his hand on the cover of the journal. ""Just add water? Huh, easy enough."" he told himself, as he prepared his will for one last round.Only this time, it was for justice. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:+ Oddworld universe+ Puzzles+ Switching between two characters on the fly+ Unique gameplay mechanics like possessing enemies, cooperating with fellow Mudokons, etc.+ Improved visuals with widescreen supportCons:- Broken gamepad support (works but needs weird tweaks)- Game felt very unstable, crashed occasionally (for many people it doesn't work at all)- Two achievements won't unlock no matter what you do- No V-sync option (NVIDIA panel won't let me force it since it's OpenGL game)- No FPS limiter, my PC run hot and loud because it tried to push as much FPS as possible (300 FPS or so)- No FPS limiter also made the game feel too fast- Minor graphical glitches, especially broken draw distance made stuff dissapear partially just to appear again in a secondSupposedly the game is gonna get the HD update in the future. I truly hope so since I really enjoyed playing it and overall this is a good game. I would totally recommend it if all of the aforementioned bugs would be fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nostalgic game at it's finest. I guess the game is kinda ruined by the auto-direction the playable character makes when you move him around, but that's what walking and tip-toeing is for! And super-bizarre characters too.Sadly, if you didn't play this game as a child, it would be harder to connect with the levels. But if you're smart enough, going through the levels should be a breeze without the need for a walkthrough. On top of that, come on, it's only six dollars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The problem with these games is Oddworld Inhabitants, the compnay that made them, probably isn't in the best position financially. As a result, these games tend to work best on the platform they're made for. This is most certainly evident for Munch's Oddysee. Couple that with the fact that it's arguably the worst game of the Oddworld series, and it'd be fairly understandable that people would pass it up.I personally love each addition to Oddworld, and this game is no exception. It may be the worst game, but that doesn't automatically make it bad, it's just not as good as the others. While most game series made their jump to 3D in the N64/PS1 generation, Oddworld did that with the Xbox... and I can't really say it was effected negatively from it. The game looked gorgeous (back then, though still kinda does here and there now), the controls were simple enough to understand, it certainly felt like an Oddworld game. Honestly it pretty much took the series into it's next logical direction. Abe is still there rescuing Mudokon's, but all in all, he's a free man... mudokon... thing. So are majority of his friends. The spotlight is all on Munch and his problem with being the last of his kind, who just happens to have a very valuable set of lungs. And did we wonder why Abe was (kinda) the only Blue Mudokon seen throughout the series? Well, it just so happens that The Almighty Raisin (roll with it) has discovered that if he helps Munch, he'll discover that.It's a game of partnership and cooperation (in a single player way). Neither can do this without the other, there's always need for them to work together in each level. It does it splendidly. Couple that with Oddworld's... 'oddness', the humour, the weird looking creatures, it's as appealing as the other games.The problem is the port to Steam. If you'd played Abe's Oddysee or Exoddus on Steam as well, there's a few problems, graphically and control wise, particularly with the controller. The graphics tend to be easy enough to sort out, but the controller for the previous games was a no-go. This game however, it is very recommended a controller be used. But unfortunately there's a few problems with the thumbstick movements and such. In the menu's, navigation doesn't work at all, only the buttons do. I use the arrow keys on the keyboard for navigation in them. As for the gameplay, I wouldn't say it's incredibly game breaking, but it definitely gets very annoying. Particularly in some of the levels where you're practically running gauntlets.It's like the movement locks itself, suddenly stiffens when moving in a random direction whenever it wants. If not moving at all, at least very slowly. It's especially bad when it comes to Munch when he's swimming, or using his wheelchair. When running from enemies or trying to make important jumps, it gets a little frustrating if the movement is suddenly stopped or slowed down.So far the only good ports controller wise for Oddworld games to Steam have been Strangers Wrath and New 'n' Tasty. I hear there's a Munch's Oddysee HD on the way, so if that's true, then hopefully these issues won't be there.As it stands right now... I do recommend the game, but I also say brace yourself for some control frustrations. If you can push past them, the game is pretty damn great.			",142,14,2,6,15,2,7

												I commend Oddworld for having the guts and the will to revist a port of one of their old games, and it just so happens to be the one I've actually played in the past. Sure, there might be better game they've made, but dammit, this is the one I've actually had memories playing.The past horror stories about the then-current PC port made me hesitant to get this version of the game, but the updated port beta was interesting enough - and I'd say it's won me over even in its rough state. Actual game is pretty much a typical 3d collectathon platformer, which would feel instantly familiar to anyone who played Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Super Mario 64, or (in my case) Rareware's 3d platformers. However, as should be familiar to players of past Oddworld games, this game heavily relies on puzzles from the two playable characters, both of whom play differently and offer their own host of challenges.So far I've only played enough to get my bearings, but this new port is really well done. On my 2k monitor and GTX 970, it runs like a dream, without many visual flaws for something that's originally from 2003. I would probably add post-processing sharpening and shaders, but the visuals could keep me playing. This game also controls well on a 360 gamepad, though I had to turn down the walk speed on one of the characters, who felt a little slippery to control in my opinion. Camera controls well, though I had to remove the inverted X axis for it to feel natural. Options are a little lackluster right now, hoping that resolution and quality options can be added in the future, and that the X360 controller controls could be more clearly indicated than using ""Button 10"" and such.I have a few issues with this while I've been playing. For one thing, the tutorials in Abe's section - can that shaman tutorial guy shut up and not halt me in my tracks with obvious crap when I'm trying to enjoy myself? I've also found it fiddly to grab Mudokons in order to toss them, feels like that could use a more generous collision box. Also, in order to active an environmental trigger, I found that you can't be right next to it, contrary to my own instincts. Finally, when multiple Mudokons chant, the audio of them becomes obnoxiously loud. I'm hoping that these issues could be addressed or tweaked in future beta releases.For $5, this would be a purchase that's well worth your time. Just remember to use the beta version of this game for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*sigh* One of the best games I've ever played! The nostalgia, the decent graphics from the year 2006 (maybe, just guessing), the Mudokon Pops! *Ahem!* Anyways, the Oddworld franchise has made quite a few changes from Oddworld Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus. Instead of the normal gameplay of sidescrolling 2D, you are now emersed in a 3D world with no insta-kill bullcrap! You can actually get mauled by Scrabs and live!!! Pretty much, just enjoy the new improvements of the game and always love Abe! MYAAH!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Munch's Oddysee is a game for the fans of Oddworld that wanted to see more of the world and its inhabitants The story, although a bit of a re-hash of the previous games, has an interesting narrative and a good humour to it; some of the poetic nature and grim undertone of the world has been dialled back a bit for a more comedic tone, it still works but the atmosphere has altered a little. There are new characters and enemies, none quite as memorable as the likes of Big Face or Molluck. Overall the story element is good but has been done better in previous games.Gameplay is trying at time, with the difficult controls and an annoying camera. Characters have the ability to respawn one another from an egg, so dying is more of a temporary setback than a penance. The ability to respawn one character by using another is handy in gameplay but does take out some of the stakes of dying, as you rarely value your life when playing.  Overall the game is another chance to get experience Oddworld, with the same humour, characters and world. I recommend Munch's Oddysee because it's just enjoyable game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It pains me to give a thumbs down to an oddworld game but munch's oddysee is still as underwhelming as it was when it was brand new.Relentless hype may have played a role in my initial disappointment. The screenshots looked superb, the familiar oddworld cosmos would be expanded into three dimensions, allowing more complex interactions with its talkative inhabitants, a deeper story, a sense of discovery. Almost none of what was promised actually ended up in the game we got. I'm not sure who dropped the ball on this one: Lorne Lanning for trying to out-Molyneux Peter Molyneux or Microsoft for rushing the game out to boost sales of its xbox console. I guess it worked, I bought one of those ugly black boxes specifically for munch's odyssee. Fortunately Stranger's Wrath and Jet Set Radio Future kept me from smashing it in frustration.15 years later with the hype properly killed I tried to give it a fresh new chance but alas Munch's Oddysee is still underwhelming. Sandwiched between the almost perfect classic 2D platformers and the much more creative and well-rounded Stranger's Wrath it stands out for its incredibly tedious redundant gameplay and frustrating fidgety controls. Even without the other titles in the franchise to compare it to, you have nothing more than a very mediocre platformer. Without the admittedly gorgeous design and atmosphere of the oddworld cosmos (that is still among the best in the business even 20 years after its first incarnation) there would be no reason to play Munch's Oddysee.I applaud the effort to ""save"" this game by polishing its graphics and fixing the PC port but the graphics were never the big problem, it was always the gameplay, the lacklustre level design and the lack of vision. If you wanted to save this game you'd have to rebuild it from the ground up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off let me say I LOVE this series and I've been told this game is a great installment in the oddworld franchise. However, the product you are looking at here isn't a game. It's not even worth the $1 it's on sale for right now. I wish I could say I've played this game but I could never get this thing to even run for more than 5 minutes without crashing. I've spent more time trying to get the game to work than I have actually playing it. In fact, I even bought a copy for the xbox, but found out that it won't run with any audio on the xbox 360. I'm sad to say that I've lost faith in one of my favorite game studios. I grew up with Abe's Oddysee and Exodus and they are both fantastic games and I definitely reccommend buying them both during the sale because they actually work. But save your dollar, you will sadly only be throwing it away on a messed up pc port that this company will never fix.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I reccomend it.Why I like it pt. 2: While fighting is part of the game it is more of a puzzle game as simply rushing in can get Abe/Munch or their followers killed. Not just another kill-stuff game. It has a quick save which comes in handy for the tricky parts. Also you don't have to worry about boredom because of the diverse(Both functionally and visually) levels. Also the game is visually appealing. And if you ever stop to smell the roses you can entertain yourself by burping or farting. Classy.For parents: Remember this game can get pretty dark at times. (Example: The human-like mudokens are escaping being eaten/enslaved by other sentient beings, and the fuzzles/Munch are escaping cruel experimentation. And some swearing/vulgar language can be heard, though some is bleeped. And Abe can possess the minds of enemies and make them kill themselves/other ones, or explode(rather gorey).Concern: I personally miss the old quirky jumping/hopping noises the characters used to make. But I would imagine it gets on some peoples nerves. I would like to see an option to toggle between the old and new sound effects.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just as amazing as it was on Xbox. Most Oddworld fans don't like it as much as the other Oddworld games but I don't know what they are talking about. They claim the puzzles are tedious and repititive but I remember Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus having repititive puzzles as well. Just like the other Oddworld games, this game will have you rescuing Mudokons. But it's not just Mudokons you rescue this time. You also have to rescue Fuzzles and Mudokon eggs. And there are also lots of power ups. It also features the same awesome cutscenes and political commentary found in the other Oddworld games. My only complaint is the camera. If you're playing on keyboard then the camera will feel kind of bad. I suggest playing on controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me just say this : I LOVE ODDWORLD. Next to every game i love from Abes oddysse to exoddus to strangers wrath they are all absolutely brilliant games (With my favourite being Exoddus) that i have played the hell out of, but saying that even though i really tried with this one i just think Munchs oddysee is a bad game.Not the worst but was just bad.It didn't look that great astetically all looking rather generic, the control i found to be way too sensitive with no natural progression behind it when doing tight platforming with abe jumping too high and running too fast on the platforms, the puzzles were honeslty kind off pathetic compared to the originals. the music was alright but didn't seem to fit with the game and its look feeling out of place and at times it didn't even feel like a oddworld game as for me a lot of the things that made oddworld what it was was gone.I will say on a positive note on how the cutscenes and overall story are still enjoyable to witness with great writing and that sometimes the controls actually accomadates the level design, but overall i didn't think it was honestly any good. I Love oddworld and if anything after i played this i played Exoddus again just because it reminded me but even if you are a massive fan and you really want to try it out DEFITNELY approach it with caution. 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												munches oddysee is one f my favourite past time games. and like the original the munch save icon is bugged so the ame freezes or crashes when you use it in the beginning of the game. however even though i was enjoying reliving this game using the Abe save icon my play was eventually cut short at the beginning of the second phase of munches story line. this game has always had bugs like this, and big woop! i can start from that check point right? ... wrong! when i tried to load my game no icon apeared no matter how much troubleshooting i did. however when i convinced myself it was ok to start again, the abe icon was ""Currently in use. Are you sure you want to overwrite this data?"" WTF now i'd love to reccomend this game to all my brothers and sisters even my mum out of love, but at this stage it would only♥♥♥♥♥♥them off... i know because thats how i feel!

												Munch's Oddysee is a mediocre game. Let's just say it's not one of the better transitions of a series from 2D to 3D. It just doesn't hold a candle to the first two games and even Stranger's Wrath.IMO it feels rushed and not very well thought out, the game is supposedly mostly about Munch, however I found myself playing as Abe about 80% of the time. Surprisingly, there isn't too much story around either, although all of the present cutscenes are expectional. There are fundamental issues with the game's tone and nature of the gameplay though. It is one thing to give Abe a life bar and a completely different thing to see him slap a Slig to death. Arming fellow Mudokons and sending them to battle is kind of hilarious at first, but gets old quickly and doesn't fit in at all with already established concepts. Lastly, the game's just too repetitive, most of the levels see you doing the same thing and it just gets uninteresting and old real fast. It's not a bad game, but it certainly isn't a good one.The PC port is pretty bad as well. The original 2010 release was full of bugs and crashed literally every 2 minutes. They've got rid of most of it, but it is still pretty bare bones. Controller support is rather bad, the analog control on my XBOX One controller was insanely off, the game crashes on modern hardware when trying to use Anti-Aliasing (thank god for Super Sampling), in-game options are incredibly lacking (Sound Effects & Music have 3 states, Mute - Soft - Loud, good job lads...). And yet it still crashes from time to time, so I'd recommend you quicksave often.Overall, I'd pass this one. If you played the first two games and want to see how the story unfolds, just watch the cutscenes on YouTube and move on to Stranger's Wrath which is a masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game, It has been a part of my childhood on the XBOX and it was always great!Unfortunetly, the port over to PC was far less pleasing than the original.Don't get me wrong, the game is still the same and ofcourse still have the fun side to it, it's just that the controller-support is not where it should be, and the keyboard+mouse layout is a joke with way to many buttons compared to the few used for controller.To top of the controller issues of the game after it has been ported to PC, it crashes.... constantly...In less than 45mins of game times (trying to do all stuff) I have crasched 9 times already, with the first crash coming before even getting out of the start-cave.If anyone would consider getting this for an original XBOX, do it, I would highly recommend that due to the game being great, however, if you consider buying this for the PC, then reconsider that, unless you somehow get to not crash constatly and manage to make a keyboard-layout that works well for you, you're gonna get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game.

My only qualm with the version here is that it doesn't teach you which keys to use, and often refers to the buttons on a controller rather than a keyboard, making it somewhat hard to learn.  Other than that, once you figure it out it's quite good, save for the crashes I've had now and then when loading levels.			",33,5,0,8,5,0,0

												I enjoyed this game on the Original Xbox, despite some issues with freezing and slow loading. I would love to enjoy this game with all the performance benefits from PC hardware, but I cannot as it has serious crashing issues.Exit the first cave, crash. Slide down the first cliff collecting spooce, keep running and colliding with something, jump into Well which shoots me back to the top of the cliff, slide down again, manage to move this time, crash.Although this game does not deliver the same (and in my opinion, better) experience of it's predecessors (Abe's Oddysee/Exoddus), it still has a lot of heart and imagination to be enjoyable. The characters of Oddworld are enough to make this game fantastic.But I am reviewing this game based on my past experience of playing it on the Xbox as the crashing on the PC renders the game unplayable.7/10 when the game works (if memory serves me well)0/10 for the Steam version, until they sort out the crashing. Stick it in your wishlist, fixes are apparently coming with the HD version, I just hope they dont expect us to pay for it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great title. I was new to the Oddworld series but this game has some nice videos that will help you catch up with the story.  Speaking of the story, it is very well done and awesome. This game was originally on xbox and had a few issues when it was ported to pc. Most of those are pretty easy to fix. The current developers are VERY helpful on the forums and have patched almost every issue. I recomend playing this with a 360 controller but you will need to apply a fix in the settings to make it work. The game is tons of fun and extremely cheap for what you get. I heartily recomend this title to platformer fans and anyone who likes a good story line in their games. ~PR0XIDIAN			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played this as a kid, you get some nostalgia value on this very well made at the time game.However, The game ages horribly, The ""Backstory"" Is voiced by Abe (One of the main characters) And his voice is similar to a five year old Squidward with a cold, And is hard to listen to.The controls are slippery, The game crashes randomly, The game is Super unfair, It's hard to predict your jumps, Catering for Abe and munch at the same time gets annoying Because munch (The other main character)'s voice Sound like a 200 Year old black guy with Siffilys, All in all the game stands up very poorly by todays standards, The graphics are okay, but trust me, If you pick up this game you won't play it often, Unless you played it as a kid, Then you get some joy out of ""Oh wow i remember this game it's so fun~!"" If not, Avoid it.-Cakepants			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in the day I was a big fan of the Abe games so when Munch came out (and I didn't have a p̶l̶a̶y̶s̶t̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶Xbox) I was quite disappointed.The good: the puzzles were generally all pretty clear. I very rarely got to a point and had no idea what to do next. Decent enough story and execution thereof.The bad:- Limited level designs, like maybe 2 major types of area are used in nearly all the levels,- The group that ported it to the PC clearly did the least amount of work possible. Want to quicksave? You have to go to the menu every time.- The controls! Space is both jump and interact, order to work and attack are on the same button, etc. I can get why you need to do that for a p̶l̶a̶y̶s̶t̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶Xbox release but it just makes the game super frustrating when you're playing on a PC.- The camera! Oh god. :( It will swing around based on the room layout and where you are, but because the movement is relative to the camera you'll be running, the camera swings, and bam. Dead. A significant amount of time I had trouble with puzzles not because I didn't know what I needed to do, but because the interface got in the way and made it difficult.So yeah, unfortunately I can't recommend it.

												A kind of decent Oddworld game. Easier puzzles and more action-oriented than the previous ones. I found it a little tedious at some points (good job solving that puzzle, now do it 20 more times!), but I still played it all the way through. It's worth playing if you really like the series but I wouldn't recommend it in general.Note that you have to opt in to the beta in order to get it running these days. And maybe it's just the beta, but the graphics actually don't look as good as they do in the screenshots. The lighting is pretty flat and the colors look sort of dull.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More cartoon-like than I thought it would be, but still a very good game. It does want to communicate many messages and opinions of the developers. But they are touched on just enough for you to get the hint, and not cross that line between hinting and preaching. Very different from its predecessors but in a good way. I would definitely suggest buying the OddBox and playing the earlier games first. Starting here, you are much more reluctant to go back to them. The gameplay is far more fun and fluid with a controller. And much of the art is scary and cute/beautiful at the same time, something I have never encountered before. It reinforces that this is a whole other world, while at the same time allowing us to sympathize with Munch.  Though there are not nearly as many puzzles as before and they're definitely easier. With the introduction of combat, it suddenly the game far easier. Arguably in a bad way. In several puzzles, you can just possess something and kill all of the enemies instead of solving it. It has some flaws but definitely worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although I put a yes at the same time I would like to say no. Just like Strangers Wrath I played back on the orignal Xbox and it was fantstic. I love Oddworld and everything inside this twisted world. But the proplem with this port of Munches Oddysee is that it's really buggy (at the time of writting this) and this feels like a direct port of the original version. From how it plays to the visuals. Although I don't judge a game by it's look I don't get why the HD version is not on Steam yet it's on other platforms. If you are new to Oddworld then you would want to pick it up via the Oddbox but maybe give it sometime and see if they fix some of the bugs.8 out of 10 (Will be changed to a 10 when the bugs are fixed) But I still love you Oddworld :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have respect for Oddworld Inhabitants taking the 3D approach back in 2000 and it was also very brave considering their fans were very upset that they didn't stick to the usual 2D approaches. But that still shows that the fans care a lot about Abe and I certainly do myself as he's a beautifully designed character with a great personality.Considering that my favourite Oddworld games are definitely towards the 2D ones, Munch's Oddysee is still a great game. The controls can be awkward at times but you tend to get used to them after a while. The level designs are nice with graphics being good for the time. Would recommend if you're a long time Oddworld fan.8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved the Abe games, but puzzle platformers wouldn't work too well in 3D.This game is like lemmings, you get a bunch of mudokans to follow you around and attack Sligs (which I consider a bad thing, this game loss all the moments of fear you'd have in the Abe games). It's also never hard, you get plenty of Mudokans and just tell them to attack.Sometimes you have to carry the mudokans from Point A to Point B which could take 30 seconds... but you have to do it 9 times cause you have to bring lots of mudokans. This game never gets hard or complex, it just becomes tedious.The controls and physics can be annoying, it feels like it's selective if it's a 8-direction movement game or 360 degrees game.No memorable narrative or plot.It just did everything Abe's Oddysee/Exoddus did but worse. I only recommend this to big Oddworld fans. It'll bore you, but it doesnt do anything to make you hate the series.I played this  March 2016 on Windows 10, I think they fixed most of the bugs. Only 1 crash, and thanks to quicksaves, it wasnt a big deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Munch's Oddysee is the first in the Oddworld series to make the jump to 3D and is the unfortunate victim of a somewhat muddled development cycle. It was originally a PS2 game which was hastily ported over to the first Xbox when Microsoft realized they needed more exclusives. Due to the combination of those two things the game neither looks as good or plays as well as it should, but despite its flaws I found it to be an enjoyable experience in the end. If you're a fan of the series and can put up with some general jank it's definitely worth playing through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This time you not only play as our old friend Abe, but also the new and polite Munch! You play as the two and together you have to save Munch's species, the Gabbits. As Abe is now a free mudokon, you get to roam the villages and wilderness of his native land. As Munch, you get to slowly make your way through the industrial environment of the Vykkers, until the two finally meet and you now have to control two characters. This works very good and opens up for alot of new puzzles and ways to approach the game.The game is executed very well and with a controller, the controls and gameplay works really good. The levels is a mix of puzzles and action, as you always have to figure out some puzzle, while taking care of enemies and saving your friends. With two characters you also get two different sets of playstyles. Abe who can move fast and agile, will posses and do most of the physical work. Munch, who is native to water, moves slowly on land, but often have to move around sneaky and open up the paths for Abe, while fighting alongside his new friends: the Fuzzles. Munch even has a newly attached neural implant, that can shoot electric shocks if boosted enough! This makes him able to take control over mechanical structures and weaponry, for an explosive exit.The graphics are nice (compared to the time) and the cutscenes are just awesome. Sometimes the puzzles can get a little tedious, but that stops as you progress further into the game. While playing you are constantly entertained by funny minor things such as jokes, posters or items found around the world, that has that special oddworld-humor about them. I had a lots of laugh as I played while listening to Abe and Munch debate, or reading the newspaper, that shows after each level. Some items are just so lame, that you have to laugh, like the Vykker's invention; The Buttflo! <- Yeah for a hard stomach I guess. The story is very good and deep, which leaves you really cheering for Munch's cause.We are introduced to new things and species, such as the Vykker. If you paid attention in Exoddus, then you'll have noticed a blocked doorway to their lab. We even get to see more of how the lives and such are inside the industrial world of Glukkons and Sligs, which is really interesting and fun. Yet we still get to see familiar things such as Mudokons, Slogs and our dear friends, the Paramites and Scrabs.One sad thing is that 2 achievements does not work, and some a bugged. This is really sad. Another problem is that you can't change the axises for the camera in settings, which is annoying. After you get used to that, it won't really affect your gameplay, but can be tricky at times. I also read that alot of people have had problems and crashes. Some were never even able to launch the game. I must say though, that I had zero problem and the only crash I had was when I Alt-Tab'ed alot in a short period of time, so that is most likely my own fault.I will suggest that you take notice and think of how well you PC has been doing previously, when handling games that could be a bit tricky and fragile. If you have had alot of crashes and such in previous games and don't really have the info to fix it yourself, I suggest you may not buy this game yet. If your PC usually play edgy games or ports good and you rarely have had crashes, then just buy the game.7/10This is only due to the lack of fixes. While I personally had no problems, I did experience achievements not to work, which is not acceptable, when you compare to the time they've had to fix it. If it ever get fixed, I will gladly return to give 10/10.			",62,6,0,5,1,0,1

												This was the first Xbox game I every played, when I got an Xbox in 2004. Nostalgia trip aside, it's better than I remember.Munch's Oddysee is a comedic anti-commercialism and anti-animal testing 3D platformer and IT IS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FUN. However there are more bugs in this game than in the real world. For me it's worked with no problems except if you save the game while checking health/quarma, the game will crash on a reload due to LIGHTING errors! There's controller support and supposedly the updated content from the HD version that's on PS3, PS4 and PSvita IS coming to PC in a future update.That was sometime last year,Netherless it's a good game when it works. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People are  at my old review.tl;dr: It runs decently now, not that great, still like a shoddy port of a pretty old game.Basically, my last review was stating that a huge portion of the playerbase couldn't run this game.Just recently (about mid 2016) the game was updated to run ""okay"" on new computers. Keep in mind the release date on this. That's right: It didn't work for years, for a large number of people. The company sucks.Anyway, enough of the game's legacy, on to the game.It's pretty dated, but as an artist, I oddly don't care about graphics really. The graphics are pretty fine for the time period, it's aged about as well as Tony Hawk's Underground 2, to give you an idea.The player is a bit funky to control, there's oddly an option that allows you to change the run and walk speeds of both characters, which should definitely be in a number of other games (cough cough 2D Sonic games cough cough.)The camera is funky, but you're gonna have to deal with that, Sonic Adventure's camera is a well-refined tool compared to this one.The game still has crashes here and there, you're gonna have to deal with it.Basically, if you liked the game, get it, if you didn't don't get it. While I feel the universe was incredibly cool, I wasn't a fan of the games, so I'm at like a 50-50, I'll upvote it so people stop crying in my comments.There, I updated my review, are you kids happy?

												When I first notice this game on the OG xbox I wanted it, but that never happened because I lost interested.  Many bloody years later I heard this game hit PSN for PS3 I wanted it & I still didn't get it because I owned a Xbox 360 but couldn't afford a PS3 & still don't have one of today.  So here is my PC review of Oddworld: Munch's oddysee.Story:  Munch's oddysee is about a Gabbit called Munch whos kind have been fished and one day Munch goes out to find them & ends up getting captured by Vykkers & taken to their labs who attach a electronic device to Munch's head so the Vykkers can get Munch to capture other wild life for experiments.  Meanwhile Abe & his Mudokon friends are being told by the Almighty Raisn about Munch's captivity & sends Abe out to save the Gabbit. When Abe & Munch return to the Almighty Raisn they are giving another task to save Mudokons & Fuzzles shutdown factorys & get the owners factory's the Glukkons to donate their cash to Lulu a homeless Gulkkon to buy the last can of Gabbiar eggs from an auction.Gameplay:  Munch's oddysee is an open 3D world puzzle platformer set in Oddworld.  The game starts off as Abe where you have to get to a big well with Abe's friends to get to Vykkers Labs to save Munch.  Abe & Munch are the two playable characters were you can use Abe & Munch can collect spooceshrubs that you need to open loacked doors. Abe's prossession ablity is changed into a small ball of energy that you an control for limited time if you have enough spoocshrubs & you can chant to grow more spooceshrubs so you can bring back dead native Mudokons & level up to make them fight enemy's.  Munch's ablity's include swimming, taken control of machines that allow you to pick items, ememys & booms. Munch can chat to Fuzzles talking & to get them to attack enemys.The game also includes vending machines that have power ups for charactors for Abe to jump higher, go invisble & run faster.  Munch's power ups include swimming faster, jumping higher & zapping ablity to attack ememys that knocks them back.I did have some glitch's with the game like dropping a Slig or a Slog in front of a van that have them running into it & blowing them away instead of stucking them in whitch is just odd & funny, but the one glitch that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was trying to get a number of Mudokons to activate a few levelers & they end saying ""theres nothing to do Abe"" that forced me to restart the level just to get my task done.          I highly recommend you play this game with a xbox controller because I couldn't handle the controls a mouse & keyboard to play this game.What I Hated: There are some things I hate about this is 1. There isn't no chat option with prossessed NPCs. 2. There is no stealth. 3. Picking up Mudokons as Abe to toss them over from area from another whitch takes up so much f**king time. 4 Not to meantion that glitch I brought up. 5. Why do the Paramites sound like pigs? 6. There is no sense of fear. 7. Why the hell does this game make you pick up sheep like animals at one point & putting them into a area while the 4 other mudokons were too busy chanting that seems more inportant to than doing there work?  The lazy b*****ds.Final Verdict: Is Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee worth getting?  umm kind of.  The graphics are a bit old & the cut scenes are just great & for the controls its best to play it with a controller, but you can handle the keyboard good on ya. So yeah its okay ish. This game & the rest of the Oddworld games (The Oddbox) are available on the Playstation net for PS3 & as of now Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee is also Avaiable now for moblie on Android IOS.

												This is an enjoyable if flawed game. In it you play Munch as well as Abe with the ability to switch back and forth between them to progress through the levels. Abe is able to jump higher, recruit Mudokons to help and can possess enemies. While Munch can swim, recruit critters, and can shock enemies. It works quite well and is a good idea in the game.The worst and biggest flaw in this game however is the terrible camera. I played on an Xbox 360 controller and it's controlled via the direction pad instead of the right stick and you cant change it. I briefly tried m + k and it's no better. Given the characters seem to move slowly unless the camera is directly behind them it makes some sections difficult like trying to jump from one platform to another for example. There is a button to centre the camera but it doesn't always help with the slowed movement problem.Good points:- Typical brilliant Oddworld humour and characters- Being able to use both Abe and Munch in tandem works well and is implemented nicely- In general the game is quite fun and has the feel of the enjoyable platformers we had in the late 90's/ early 00'sBad points: - That bloody camera. It really does hold the game back and makes doing simple things a lot harder. The fact you cant map it to the joystick on the controller is ridiculous.So overall a good game that could have been much better with a bit more polish and some attempt to fix the problems with a camera. The problems with it may put some people off but stick with it and theres an fun game here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This time you not only play as our old friend Abe, but also the new and polite Munch! You play as the two and together you have to save Munch's species, the Gabbits. As Abe is now a free mudokon, you get to roam the villages and wilderness of his native land. As Munch, you get to slowly make your way through the industrial environment of the Vykkers, until the two finally meet and you now have to control two characters. This works very good and opens up for alot of new puzzles and ways to approach the game.The game is executed very well and with a controller, the controls and gameplay works really good. The levels is a mix of puzzles and action, as you always have to figure out some puzzle, while taking care of enemies and saving your friends. With two characters you also get two different sets of playstyles. Abe who can move fast and agile, will posses and do most of the physical work. Munch, who is native to water, moves slowly on land, but often have to move around sneaky and open up the paths for Abe, while fighting alongside his new friends: the Fuzzles. Munch even has a newly attached neural implant, that can shoot electric shocks if boosted enough! This makes him able to take control over mechanical structures and weaponry, for an explosive exit.The graphics are nice (compared to the time) and the cutscenes are just awesome. Sometimes the puzzles can get a little tedious, but that stops as you progress further into the game. While playing you are constantly entertained by funny minor things such as jokes, posters or items found around the world, that has that special oddworld-humor about them. I had a lots of laugh as I played while listening to Abe and Munch debate, or reading the newspaper, that shows after each level. Some items are just so lame, that you have to laugh, like the Vykker's invention; The Buttflo! <- Yeah for a hard stomach I guess. The story is very good and deep, which leaves you really cheering for Munch's cause.We are introduced to new things and species, such as the Vykker. If you paid attention in Exoddus, then you'll have noticed a blocked doorway to their lab. We even get to see more of how the lives and such are inside the industrial world of Glukkons and Sligs, which is really interesting and fun. Yet we still get to see familiar things such as Mudokons, Slogs and our dear friends, the Paramites and Scrabs.One sad thing is that 2 achievements does not work, and some a bugged. This is really sad. Another problem is that you can't change the axises for the camera in settings, which is annoying. After you get used to that, it won't really affect your gameplay, but can be tricky at times. I also read that alot of people have had problems and crashes. Some were never even able to launch the game. I must say though, that I had zero problem and the only crash I had was when I Alt-Tab'ed alot in a short period of time, so that is most likely my own fault.I will suggest that you take notice and think of how well you PC has been doing previously, when handling games that could be a bit tricky and fragile. If you have had alot of crashes and such in previous games and don't really have the info to fix it yourself, I suggest you may not buy this game yet. If your PC usually play edgy games or ports good and you rarely have had crashes, then just buy the game.7/10This is only due to the lack of fixes. While I personally had no problems, I did experience achievements not to work, which is not acceptable, when you compare to the time they've had to fix it. If it ever get fixed, I will gladly return to give 10/10.			",62,6,0,5,1,0,1

												I bought this game for pc near it's (re)release back in the ending of 2010 / start of 2011 (-ish)  for 9.99 Euro, because I remembered that I had loads of fun with it as a kid on the original xbox. Unfortunately this game is barely playable, since it crashes very often, and the controls could be a little more fluid, even when using a controller. I don't recomend buying this game since the developers clearly have abandoned this unfinished port, thanks a lot... I would rather have no game, THAN A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UNPLAYABLE ONE!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish I could give this game a good review.Before playing the PC version of Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee, I only have good memories of playing the original Microsoft Xbox version as the very first console game I purchased. I know for a fact that this is a great game, Ive played through and beaten it before and enjoyed it in all its glory back in the elementary school days, but the PC version couldn't remind me of that.Mostly because the game doesn't work.The PC version is littered with crashed and bugs that take away from the experience entirely. Miraculously, I did make it through the game; after tweaking, restarting, and autosaving my game every minute. From what I hear, the only difference between this version and the Xbox version is antialiasing. No upgraded textures, horrible button remapping, and the menu's resolution reminds me of a pixellated arcade game.I dont know why Oddworld would stop their support for this, but doing so has left a bad taste in my mouth for what I feel so nostalgic for. Verry disappointed to have purchased this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It does not live up to the standards of its predecessors, and I only recommend it to the hardcore fans of the Oddworld franchise.The transition to 3D is great, but the levels are more confined to smaller environments and feels disconnected from one another, unlike Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus which featured large, connected environments that made you feel taking part on an epic journey. In Munch's Oddysee, the levels are small and short, and completing each one takes you to the next with no continuity or explanation except for a few instances. For some reason the detail of each locale in the first two games are also gone. There are only two to three environments recycled throughout the levels, and each one of them looks bland and uninteresting.Although the title of the game is Munch's Oddysee, I found myself using Abe most of the time. Abe is sufficient for most puzzles, save for a few. The puzzles are also usually exploitable. Instead of forcing you to think of the intended solution, there are many times when you can just bypass it by simply possessing all enemies and blowing everything up. There are some annoyingly repetitive sections which serve no purpose but to give an illusion of length to a rather short game. The puzzles start off quite interesting, but become monotonous later on until the last few levels. Some elements (Fuzzles, Interns) make severely limited appearances throughout the game.The saving grace is that the story still feels like an Oddworld tale, with its classic humor and social commentary. The cutscenes are excellent as well. I still enjoyed the game, only because I am a fan of the franchise. But I don't think this game is for someone who's still trying to get into Oddworld (try the first two games for that). This certainly is the weakest link in the main Oddworld series.

												Munch's Oddysee was one of my favorite games as a kid and usually sells for dirt cheap. Playing it on PC with maximum resolution was a new experience, and the only bugs in the game were also in the original release. [Removes nostalgia goggles]The gameplay was pretty fun but there aren't many new mechanics introduced after the first two hours to make the following 10-15 hours as fun. The camera works very poorly with a mouse and there's no setting to turn off inverted y movement. Design other than gameplay was all-around good. There was tasteful use of cutscenes and a lot of fluidity to the game's progress. Some scenes still gave me genuine excitement after a decade since playing it the first time.Final verdict: 7/10			",143,11,2,6,12,0,24

												""There's my buddy""Great game ported really awkwardly, you're gambling when you install it because of what issues the game has. Incredible game with lovable characters but the jarring problems with crashing and optimization sort of ruins it. I'm reccommending it sheerly for childhood purposes. Controls on PC are pretty butt compared to the old xbox version. Incredible game, just wish the steam version was pulled off better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh my goodness, this game is awesome. I remember playing this as a kid on my small little playstation, and only wanting to wake up to munch and abe kicking some bad booty. I could not remember this game as a child growing up now and it hadn't stuck into my brain, but i persisted because i loved it too much to let this old favorite go. I definitley recommend this game and all the other oddworld games to be bought and be proud of having it in their games folder.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The xbox version of this game is one of my all time favorites, but this is a terrible port. If I use my keyboard, I can't get out of the opening level before the game crashes. If I use a controller, it will crash as soon as I touch a button. It doesn't matter what compatibility mode I run it in, this is the best it will do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fantastic game running on a horrible PC port. I can't even finish the first level without it crashing non-stop. I was really hoping that they did it right, as when I was a kid I played this game non-stop, but seriously guys, I hate to say it but don't waste your money on this horrible port, you would be better off buying it for the original Xbox.

												A must have for fans of the origonal oddworld games. This one being in 3D might cheese some people off, but the creators have put a lot of effort into this, making new types of enemies to fight, out-think or control. The humour is fun as always and the chance for multiple endings will entice you for multiple play throughs.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												Let me just preface this with the fact that I am a recovering marijuana addict. Now that I got that out of the way, let me tell you about the miracle cure to my disease that is Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. This game has shown me a disgustingly accurate parallel to my own life through Abe's eyes (or rather, a third person camera following him). Every little detail from his lack of impulse control collecting these green spores (which is a direct correlation to my lack of impulse control snorting marijunanas like it was no tomorrow) to the way he barks orders at his subserviant friends (the way I used to hike up pot prices to 16 year old kids who didn't know the difference between kush and kale). My eyes are opened and I now know better than to ingest more than 1 marijuana a day. Thank you, Abe.			",226,18,1,26,7,0,5

												I admit, I thought this game is going to be better, unfortunately it's not close to the level of it's predecessors. Sure, we have Abe again but it's kind of watered down both in the maturity (no more dark comedy) and in the difficulty department. Not to mention the quality of the port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not entriely sure why this game is so fun. It might just be nostalgia, but the overall feel of the game being the environments, silly sound effects, voices, etc, are what make Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee such a great game. You come to love the humor inside the well-put together cinematics along with the characters and their backstories. Speaking of which this game comes with the option to view the cinematics from the first two games (Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee / Oddworld: Abe's Exoduss) to give you an idea for what has happened and where the storyline currently is. I actually never really got to play the full game, just the demo-disc from the original Xbox, and even that was a bag full of awsomeness. Now I truly get to experience the whole ride, and I'm loving it so far!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												there are some Bad points to this game all being technical issues my copy of the game crashes endlessly. I remember playing this on the Original Xbox back in the day, you know how you have fond memories for a game but you play it again & it never lives upto what you remember, we not so with this game this game in fact is better than how you remember it. This is a lesson on how to build seriously original games, with endearing Characters.From the opening cutscreen this game will grab you & demand to be played, & is probably the most emotional moment in gaming history. The game has a lot to live upto after that cutscreen & it delivers & delivers consistatly for 23 levels. You control 2 characters the first is Abe & you also Control the star of the show Munch.Never before has a game entertained both myself & my children so much. Mario 64 is widley considered to be one of the best platform games ever made we this is better.Essential purchase no matter what game genre you usually play. it's just a pity Munch's Oddysee Crashes so much on pc			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really fun game that I fondly remember from the old Xbox days...but maybe I'm seeing it through rose-tinted glasses.Camera controls and controls in general are just beyond atrocious.  Why bother allowing the mouse to control the camera movement at all if it's just going to reset it back the instant you start moving again?  Default camera positioning is terrible (get a nice view of abe and munch's♥♥♥♥♥ and can't ever tell what's going on because there's virtually no height to the camera positioning, so everything's always overlapping everything else, making it super difficult to get a sense of depth.Honestly devs, fixing the camera system has to be just about the biggest benefit to cost ratio imaginable.  As it is now, the game is just too much of a hassle to play.Side note: other minor problems with the PC port (that I'm pretty sure they're already fixing) include my head being crushed like a soda can between my headphones by certain random sound effects.  Possessed a slig for the first time... don't remember their pants being so deafening. ;)EDIT:  Worth noting: I'm playing on the beta branch, which has the latest updates, but I tried to take that into account when writing the above review. Camera problems still exist in regular game.			",90,21,0,4,15,2,15

												For about a year now, this game has been unbootable for basically everyone.Not even a 1kb patch, and they still haven't figured it out.Pathetic.Oh, and when you go to the launcher, make sure to set the compatibility to windows 95 and hope to ♥♥♥♥ it actually plays longer than 5 minutes, or past the first section of the game.Even better, there's been talk about an upcoming patch since 2013. We're nearing 2015.No real PC controls, you can use the keyboard ONLY, I knock off 8 points for this, as there's NO excuse for something that stupid.DO NOT BUY THIS, EVEN FOR NOSTALGIA'S SAKE, THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SCAM!Just so you understand the severity of this problem, this isn't an early ♥♥♥♥ing access, this is a game released in 2013, it's been like this, for a ♥♥♥♥ing year. STOP ACCEPTING MEDIOCRITY & SCAMS-2/10 lowest score I've ever given a game. Which is unfortunate, since I grew up with these games when I was a young lad, guess I gotta pull out that Xbox and relive the glory days with that big♥♥♥♥♥controller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a vast improvement over its predecessors, but it's still not great.  The camera is totally wonky and I had to invert the horizontal camera movement for it to feel less unnatural.  Graphics are better than the previous games, but voice acting isn't much better.  Trying to remember the numbers for commands is tedious, and don't seem to work all that well in the first place.  Certain levels are more difficult than others, but the minefield level is by far the worst and most frustrating.  I also hate the fact that the action button and jump are the same, as you'll need to use both functions quite often.  Half the time the game does the opposite function, which gets old real quick.

												I can't Recommend this game. The only way for it to work is if you launch it outside of Steam with the exe file. This will disable the Steam overlay so you don't get your achievments and can't take screenshots. Also if you play this with a Xbox pad or Ps3 pad you have to sweak the keyboard so the pad works correctly. This Is an amazing game but the ports needs work. ( hours ago Oddworld posted they they would be working on the game, I hope so. In the meantime ill downwote this game. Don't buy it in this state.			",770,119,31,28,18,9,49

												5/10 - Mediocre. Only get it if you're a fan of the series and it's on sale.Much of the sense of wonder, inspiring visuals and stellar sound design from the previous games are totally gone in this one. Since nothing is pre-rendered anymore, a lot of things look blocky and dated. The environments are samey and really, quite boring for the most part. The new races/creatures in Munch's Oddysee aren't anything overly interesting. Vykkers are just thrift store Glukkons. Fuzzles are just mentally challeneged kuriboh's -- even Munch himself is an unlikeable toad thing who tries to sound like Abe used to. The only new characters with a somewhat interesting personality are Raisin (who you'll barely see in the game and is just there for exposition) and the Shaman (who's just there for tutorial purposes and more exposition) I'd be surprised if there turned out to be more than five tracks in the game. There's a generic ""Uh oh! Trouble!"" tune, a generic ""We're outside"" tune and a ""Now we're in some factory place"" tune. Levels don't get their own music anymore, and the music that IS there doesn't get altered in an empowering manner like it used to when you'd possess someone. Even combat sounds from hitting someone with your bare hands, to electrocuting and shooting now sounds like slapstick schlock.The combat went from requiring strategy and timing, from just gathering AI allies to gank on other AI characters. It's in combat that you'll notice how things went from harsh and violent, to cartoony and risk-free. In previous games, getting shot at meant you were DEAD. Here, your character literally yells ""Ow!"" as kid-friendly star particles show up, instead of just blood. Hell, even things that SHOULD dismember enemies (such as meat-cutting machinery and Abe's post-posession explotions) now just turn baddies into a bunch of drumsticks. COOKED drumsticks, so they're not even red.Previous games used to take pride of how different they were. There was no lifebars, no power-ups, no direct means of attack. You depended solely on your wit and your resourcefulness. Now you can just slap ANYTHING to death and bruteforce every level into completion. Not to mention you gotta go around collecting those stupid ""spruce"" things to be able to possess enemies (if you don't wanna just slap them to death yourself) and the game now has powerups in the form of conveniently placed vending machines -- almost making the other games seem subtle and realistic in comparison.Surprisingly, rescuing your allies is even more tedious in this one. Sometimes you'll have to carefully position yourself behind other mudokons to grab them and toss them to places they can't otherwise reach. Sometimes you gotta count every single unit before engaging in combat to make sure you didn't suffer casualties. Don't even get me started about labor eggs and cranes.Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus were tough acts to follow indeed. As an Abe fan, I really gotta say Munch's was not worth the disappointment I felt; when I learned it was an Xbox Original exclusive back in the day.			",209,27,3,20,9,2,13

												I never played this game when it was on original xbox so there's no nostalgia for me. I tried. I really tried to like this game. I gave is a couple hour effort because I played Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath and liked that, but not this. This game is just kinda cheesy. Strange sound effects, weird voices, and bewildering story. It was not bad with the puzzle parts though. They were a little interesting, but there wasn't much to do.That doesn't mean it was a terrible game, it just wasn't for me. It seemed to run well and from what I can tell everything worked well. It's just so...2001.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really fun way to kill a few hours and have some laughs.   This game is a great casual game with a lot of hidden jokes - adertisements in the game etc.   Very simple game -with occasionally annoying controls (keyboard and mouse).  However, I play the game for the fun of all the consumerism jokes making fun of the things we see in everyday life - like advertising.   Besides, nothing is funnier than the way some of the villians are killed.  I have enjoyed this game for hours in the past (not on steam) and could not resist buying it and playing on Steam since I no longer have the game on a console system.			",94,47,1,17,7,0,20

												I don't usually write reviews for games but I felt like this one is needed. For those who bought this game awhile ago but found out it is a bad port, JOIN THE BETA, I just tried it today and it works great. Before I would get below 10 frames and most of the time I couldn't even get into the game but now its a steady fps of 50, it sometimes drops to 45 but barely and either way thats a lot better than below 10. I used my Xbox one mini controller and at first the controls for the movement and camera seemed inverted but a simple switch and now its alright but when I got out of the cave, the movement controls were messed up again but just reset them and good to go, other than that I haven't found any other problems for far. This is a great game and its awesome they finally started to try to make this port better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game brings back so many childhood memories. Playing on the old school version Xbox years ago. So when I saw it was available on Steam, I bought it straight away! I loved this game back then and I still love it now. You play as Abe, who was part of the previous Oddworld games and also a new character called Munch. You work together to beat the bad guys and its pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥ Munch can swim and Abe can possess and chant people making it awesome! The game includes saving Mudokons which you had to do in the original games. The one thing that annoys me from playing this on the PC is moving the camera angle using my mouse and it can sometimes spaz out, but other than that, its a beautiful game which doesn't require a brilliant computer. Highly recommend this game to all! Full of puzzles, challenges and well you can make Abe fart as well....so overall rating8.5/10 :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
