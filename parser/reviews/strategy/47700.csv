												Do not buy this game.Many people gave this game a bad review because the many changes in the game formula. Is fair to say that this is not a sequel to Command & Conquer, It is much more like a action strategy spin-off. That is not the reason why this game is bad, but here are some reasons why you should not buy it:- Permanent online connection require to play. In the middle of the campaign EA servers went down and now i simply can't play until they decide to go back up. Now i am here, angry, writing a review.- Requires you to login and input your password every time you start the game.- Unskippable cutscenes- Lack of mission variety, is most of the time build troops and walk around the map destroying everything in empty skirmishers style maps. Is really hard to believe that this game was released in the same year that Starcraft 2 came out.- The new mechanics are really average, there is not much do to. They cut out resource collection, all you do is choose the appropriate MCV to the situation and walk with your troops.- Units are ultra resilient. It may take minutes of firing to kill an enemy armada. Combat is not fun.Edit: You also lost the mission progress when the game lose connection.			",201,53,1,41,7,0,33

												I'd give this game 1/5 stars.In all fairness, the gameplay is a completely different concept from the previous games. As a concept it's... unique and might have some potential, but they certainly didn't pull it off. If you're looking for a steroidal version of Tiberian Sun and Tiberian Wars, this isn't it. If you're looking for closure to the series, then the end of the storyline is worse than the books following Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. The story is stupid, the acting is worse, and more immature and childish than Red Alert. Do you really want to know how this series ends? Fine, here it is: Kane makes peace with GDI for free, and in both the GDI and NOD campaigns you are protecting Kane on his quest to cross the portal to join the aliens. The end. Horrible game, total waste of time and money, horrible end to an otherwise great story.			",34,2,0,18,2,0,21

TL;DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars ReviewCommand & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath ReviewINTRODUCTION:Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is a real-time strategy game developed and published by Electronic Arts. This title serves as the official sequel to the critically acclaimed C&C 3: Tiberium Wars  and acts as the final chapter in the decade and a half long Command & Conquer Tiberian franchise.PLOT (No Spoilers):The story picks up 15 years after the end of Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath. The Scrin has been defeated, Kane has successfully recovered the Tacitus and the Brotherhood of NOD is merely a shadow of its former self. Despite the Scrin's failed invasion, all is not well as Tiberium now spreads in an ever more rapid rate and human extinction is almost inevitable. The game starts with Kane offering the remaining world leaders a solution to this problem.PROS:+ Return of live action cinematics but...(See CON #1)+ Good sound effects and voice acting+ Interesting veterancy system with visual upgrade changes for each level of veterancy+ Good special effects and graphics (but average art style)+ Interesting new unitsCONS:- Poor costume quality for the live action cutscenes- No base building- No resource gathering- DRM Stacking (Always Online + Log-in requirement every time you start the game)- Unlock and account level up system that ruins the game's unit availability: (meaning you can't jump to multiplayer immediately because half of your units are locked.)- Population Cap- The game is lore deficient, with a rushed and confusing story- Poorly written and poorly executed attempt to establish “emotional depth” by giving the Commander a wife that most players won't care about.- Lack of mission variety and the fun stealth missions were completely removed- No side bar like the old games; the entire UI looks bad as a whole- Too much deviation from the C&C source material meaning it neither look nor feel like a C&C game- Ridiculously low damage and high HP for every unit that results in...(See next CON)- VERY slow paced action- Pathfinding problems- Severe balance issues- Very short campaign time- Small and poorly designed campaign maps- The game as a whole feels rushed and cheapNEUTRAL:+/- The 'Crawler / MCV' unit building system is an interesting idea but it shouldn't have been implemented on an already existing franchise such as C&C because it already has an established (and working) formula.CONCLUSION:A VERY BAD sequel which stands as an insult to the fans of a 15 year old franchise. In EA's attempt to “innovate,” they failed to see what made the Command and Conquer games fun for a lot of people.WORTH IT?NO, the game is not worth it. I would not recommend this game to anyone even on a sale, specially if you're a fan of the old games. You're better off buying the previous titles like Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars and its expansion.FINAL NOTES:I would have been kinder in my criticism of this game if it did not have the Command and Conquer name on it. Tiberian Twilight would have sold better and would have been received better by the community if it was merely a spin-off rather than the finale of the franchise.This video expresses clearly what I feel about this game.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												This game virtually forces you to play with other people in multiplayer online.

I tried this game for awhile, and finagled myself into a CPU only match but it was a big hassle and the gameplay is not as satisfying as the previous titles. I do not recommend this to fans of the series. I would only buy this game if you are also a hormone fuled 12 year old looking to embarass other kids online.			",214,64,4,32,52,2,35

												An utter abomination of a game that only earns the right to use the C&C logo because of the live action story involving Joe Kucan as Kane.  Seriously, C&C4 completely abandons every core element of what made the Command and Conquer identity in the first place.  #1) Battles take place more in arena venues than true story dictated maps.  #2) Your unit count is so small that you can forget building an army #3) You cannot build base fortresses and your production capabilities are easily lost and recovered meaning you've got nothing important to defend and no ultimate goal in smashing your opponent's key structure. #4) The ingame economy is so simplified and anemic that it removes any remaining strategic decisions so that it becomes impossible to out-produce your opponent. #5) Progress is slow and boring since you must tediously earn experience points in order to unlock better units. #6) The visual language of the unit designs is no longer clear making it very hard to understand why one unit is superior to another, and not only that but all the units are extremely wimpy with little ability to decisevly break through enemy forces.C&C4 started out as an experimental idea for a cheaply made free-to-play RTS game and was then forcibly upgraded into a C&C game.  The live action story moments are the only thing worth mentioning about this game to anyone with a passing care about the Command Conquer franchise and for that just go to Youtube where you can see it all for free.  What a terrible, unforgiveable waste of time and resources this game is.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

Absolute total tosh.No base building, no resource gathering, no huge army, you HAVE to have an internet connection at all times even if you're only playing single player, small variety of units that you need to level up to gain access to in the first place...and well, you get the idea.I tried to get into the game, I really did, but an hour is all I could manage before I made up my mind.I've played C&C ever since RA95 and loved every other C&C game upto Kanes Wrath. RA3 wasn't too bad, but it isn't really great either, Uprising again, wasn't too bad, but not great.This is just the final nail in the coffin for this franchise...or I guess in EA's terms, this game was the final check on their list of ""Excellent Game Franchise's to ABSOLUTELY destroy""NotEvenWorthARating/10, as it's just that bad. Kane is very disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												That is a sad truth that both players and the C&C series itself have been stripped off of its well deserved proper ending. EA created a chimera (apparently trying to take likeness of the other RTS titles) forgetting that this game has been an icon and should not be so awfully transformed. Thus dies C&C from house Westwood.Adding injury to insult the new hybrid of a game is not even enjoyable to play. Tactics and strategy were limited to just positioning your mobile base and produce produce produce units. No money means just keeping the number of units at maximum and trying to utilize their not so useful abilities to win a mini skirmish after another in hope of reaching the mobile (sic!) enemy base to destroy it. The process gets boring after an hour of gameplay. On easy, the AI is practically dormant. On normal, computer produces units all the time that it becomes overwhelming.I won't rate multiplayer as I dont care about it. I wanted a good and fitting story to end a legendary plot. What did we get? A slap in the face. They might as well just put the credits at the beginning and be done with it. A MAJOR disappointment. I hope someone picks up the torch where C&C 3 left it. Kane WILL be back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried really hard to like this game, as it's the final C&C game that it looks like we're getting in a long time - could even be the last the way EA is heading with their BS. This game shows a fantastic idea, a fantastic concept, something that could have worked out great - IF IT DIDN'T HAVE THE LABEL AS A FULL ON SEQUEL TO THE TIBERIUM UNIVERSE C&C GAMES. As a spinoff, this game would have been mediocre, but as the official sequel and ending to the C&C storyline, this game is abysmal in every way possible.Not a single thing feels C&C about this game - theres a tiny population cap, there's no base building, there's no resource collection, maps are small, the campaign is abysmal with a terrible storyline and cutscenes that don't just look bad - they are legitimately stuff someone likely recorded with their iphone camera and slapped into the game! Just watch any sections that involve the ""public"" speaking rather than paid actors. The only saving grace in the storyline is Joe Kucan, who as always takes the role of Kane and makes an extremely badass villain until a terrible ending that's the same regardless of which faction you go with - AN ENDING THAT'S THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHICH FACTION YOU GO WITH. Let that sink in.The progression system is terrible - yes, there's a progression system. This game revolves around collecting tiberium crystals INDIVIDUALLY and using them to upgrade your MCV to higher tiers to unlock better units and such. However, when you start, you are level 1 and have access to absolutely NOTHING. Only after you level up several times will you unlock the 2nd tier of technology which at first is completely worthless without a single thing used for it. Everything has to be unlocked through progression and this BLATANTLY makes anyone who's a higher level than you stronger than you with no workarounds based on how good of a player you are or anything, PERIOD. For example, you have to pick a class - offensive, defensive, or support. If you go defensive, at the beginning of the progression scale you only have access to 3 infantry units. No vehicles of any sort, period. While these infantry units CAN be used to counter other infantry, vehicles, or aircraft, they're all infantry and can be MUCH MORE EASILY COUNTERED by a diverse enemy army.This is a game that again, has a fantastic concept that was soiled by something that clearly had the goal of being made with the least amount of funding possible, the least motivation possible, and the smallest amount of time necessary to produce it - probably so EA wouldn't have to pay people to work on this game any longer than they would have to before it was BARELY functional as a game and could be pushed out the door, which is exactly what they did.And what sucks is, if everyone is maximum level on progression, the multiplayer can actually potentially be fun. It feels like the game was designed for that, but it was just unfinished, so to pad the length of the game and make people play it longer, they slapped progression in to make you grind to be level 20 (the cap).Do not buy this game. If you want a good C&C game from recent times, go with Red Alert 3. Just don't expect any multiplayer options since this is the ONLY C&C GAME to not run on Gamespy and the gamespy servers are going to tank here in a month.			",280,35,7,24,85,3,94

												With the new Steam Awards gimmick, I have proposed this as a contender for the  'Most Effective Franchise-Killer' award.I have to go; looking at this thing makes me vaguely nauseous.Oh! As an added bonus, and proving that even EA themselves cannot bring themselves to give any appreciable fraction of a f**k about this game, they have since botched the authentication; even if you wanted to subject yourself to this mess, you can't.Good job all round.

												Falls well below the standard many have come to expect of the C&C brand. A passable attempt at co-op, but hardly worth it, given the vast number of games that do it better.Avoid at all cost for those looking for singleplayer.			",30,1,0,2,4,0,11

												It made me cry. I first got a hold of Command and Conquer with Red Alert Retaliation on the PSX when my dad came home from Bosnia. When I asked him if I could play it, he said it would just make me mad. I was maybe 6. I didn't know what to do. I learned how to select and grab units by holding down the X button and moving the directional buttons. I selected all my units and would move them about. I didn't know that big♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing truck could turn into a structure that built more structures. Boy, was I ♥♥♥♥ing excited then! I used to leave my playstation on in the morning and come back after school to continue with my skirmishes. I'd like to play ""Peacekeeper"" where I'd prevent the cpu's from killing each other off. Then I got the Firestorm pack. Fast Forward to about maybe 9 years later and I had a pc in my room. One of those prebuilt ones your mom and dad give you when they get a new one. I bought the Pack that contained Red Alert 2. Red Alert 2 Yuris Revenge. Renegade. Tiberian Sun. and Firestorm. It was with Renegade that I got on the internet and found out about Gamespy. ♥♥♥♥ I miss the ol days. It was great. I was ignorant and didn't know about the greed of companies yet. Then eventually CnC3 came out. I was HYPED! I thought I was for GDI. But then Kane's Wrath came out. Now Im a Noddie fer lyfe! Then.... Then IT came out. The abomination called CNC4. I bought it of course. I kept telling myself that it had to have base building in it. Why would they do that?! Why would they turn it into a cash grab?! Don't they care about us? I never played the campaign. I didn't want to. Until today. March 24th 2017. I will face the campaign and deal with it. Because I know EA will never part with the IP. They suck companies dry and then throw them in the pit of the dead and move on to the next ones. RIP Westwood and my childhood innocence. Goodluck to Petroglyph.And may EA and every Executive there burn in hell.At 4:44 AM on March 25th. I finished the NoD campaign. I feel sick to my stomach.			",135,2,0,11,13,0,34

												Mandatory EA account required. Locked out of most units until you have played the game enough to acquire arbitrary XP amount set by developers (even in skirmish mode). Inferior visual quality, animations, and gameplay when compared to C&C 3 (which is an earlier game by several years). Kane is no longer the Messiah. Tiberium saga ends with a wimper instead of a bang. Would not recommend.			",13,5,0,4,4,0,9

Posted: June 17, 2015
												Okay so i have been a fan of C&C for about 20 years now and I can safely say this is THE most disapointing title I have ever played.I'll start with a positive though I did like the asthetic, It wasn't half bad, The nod didn't look quite how I'd expect them to but overall it was okay. However that is the only positive I have about the game and not a very strong one at that, now for the negatives.Lets start with the most glaringly obvious one which i think everyone feels the same and that's the campaign... This had to be written by some emotionless, imbecilic monkey. It literally starts off going THIS NAMELESS CHARACTER IS YOUR WIFE CARE ABOUT HER!!!! (uhhh okay???) Okay seriously why would I care about this character, I've literally never seen them before but the game just expects you to care about her and really really obnoxiously tries shove it down your throat it's insane because aboviously they're going to use her as a plot device. I think a bloody 5 year old can figure that out.The campaign is insanely short as well I completed the whole thing in about 2.5 hours, that's it... the whole thing.. and like an hour of it is a tutorial. It ends so suddenly as well I was like wait is that it. I just did like 4 missions after the tutorial crap and then poof, done, over. I can only imagine that they were planning on bringing out a tonne of garbage DLC for this just to unlock more campaign missions.Now for the Gameplay... It's terrible just flat out terrible, it's watered down from other games and lacks any sort of depth or strategy.This is literally it it, You start off with your main ""structure"" called a Crawler, now you move your crawler to whatever objective you have which is either one of 3 things: Capture thing, kill thing or Defend thing. (defending thing being the most annoying since you have no control over said thing it will generally just run into things and get itself killed, it's like ""Hay you know what would be a fun idea, lets walk face first into that big horde of enemies over there. I'm sure things will be completely fine!""). Now as I was saying here's what the gameplay is: Move Crawler to objective, Deploy Crawler, Throw♥♥♥♥♥♥at problem until it goes away, move to next objective. That's it, that's all I did, I didn't have to care about what units I built since all i had to do is build the spider tanks with the big♥♥♥♥♥tesla coil and throw them at the enemy, I didn't even have to worry about them dying since if you build like 3 or 4 engineers everything you have is pretty much immortal anyway. i didn't even have to worry about my base since there's no base building to worry about and the base came with me anyway so screw defenses. Oh and for tech it's literally hay see that red crystal over there? yeah pic that up like 1 or 2 of them and you can INSTANTLY unlock every single bit of tech you want.So that's it that's C&C 4 in all it's terribleness. The only way I could possibly recommend this game is to play it just to see how bad it is.			",165,24,1,32,9,0,25

												This game is everything that is wrong with the C&C series. Ever since the closing of Westwood Studios the entire franchise has been plummeting to it's death brought about by a starvation for innovative game play that remains true to the original series. Tiberian Twilight proves that there are no new good ideas left and C&C needs to be put to bed or have the reigns handed off to someone more responsible. This game ended up being one of the worst RTSs I have ever played and the person who bought it for me felt the need to apologize for the rotten pile of progamming that sits in a place of dishonor amongst my Steam games.

												Took me almost half an hour to start this up because the required registration page wouldn´t allow me to create an account. (Support also requires you to be logged in already, I bet the guys at EA find that hilareous)The point where I could not go on because it was so ultimately boring was about an hour into the game.Until then I really suffered through the bad interface and the annoyingly low zoom out possibility.There are other RTS franchises out there already that are a lot closer to what a good C&C used to be. Have a look for them instead, your money is not only invested much better, they also actually deserve the support. I had this in my library for quite some time since it was part of a bundle. This was a good reminder for me why I stay clear from EA titles as much as I can.			",338,106,9,52,31,2,67

												Long story short, this game was a waste of my money and has shaken my faith that any game with the CnC name against it can ever be good enough to make up for this train wreck. I have played the CnC games since the very first game and have eagerly followed the series and even have followed the Red Alert spinoffs. This particular game is the poorest of the entire series, in my opinion and manages to take several steps backwards from the previous CnC Tiberium Wars. Multiplayer is only truly available after several hours of grinding in the single player campaign so that you can unlock units or some such nonsense. The graphics are worse than the previous game! The game menu forces you to be logged onto EA's public chat rooms or whatever crap they think is best for a paying customer to be logged onto when playing a single player game and this entire experiment of a game is repulsive. The game is poor and best avoided. CnC 3 is a much much more enjoyable experience in both the single player and mulitplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is no base building, uninspired and somewhat lackluster units, and a weird leveling system (you unlock units as you gain levels so someone with level 10 units could join your campaign and breeze you through it hilariously). The multiplayer is not much better. The story is forgettable and the acting is mediocre. This game can be avoided altogether.			",158,46,0,33,12,0,29

												(SUMMARY OF THIS REVIEW: DON'T BUY THIS GAME. EA KILLED CNC WITH THIS GAME)With this game, Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, electronic arts put forth their single greatest INSULT to the gaming community, and ultimately one of the dumbest business decisions in gaming history. In a pathetic, short sighted attempt at trying to push the highly coveted Command And Conquer brand onto a new generation of gamer, they have destroyed everything CNC has stood for.In order to appeal to a NEW playerbase of (GUESSTIMATE) 50 000-80 000 players from a NEW generation of gamers, they have created a fast paced RTS that is so heavily disconnected from the ENTIRE CNC genre up to this point, it is unrecognizeable as an actual command and conquer title, and more closely resembles a next-gen mobile-tower defense game.In doing so, EA Games made its BIGGEST mistake. In order to appeal to a NEW small audience, they ALIENATED the older audience which comprises over two MILLION players, probably more. From both a lore standpoint and shockingly a business standpoint, CNC4 was a BIG mistake.While CNC 4 is in itself a good game for what it is, not a true RTS but more an RTS based mobile tower defense game. Good graphics, good gameplay, good story, brilliant unit balancing, as always to be expected from a CNC title. But, the game is NOT command and conquer. The original CNC games were base building, calling on MASSIVE armies of PC shattering numbers of units into HUGE, tiny or small battlefields.THAT is what the players of the CNC series grew up with. Thats what they fell in love with. THAT gameplay mechanic of building a fortress and a massve army was what drove CNC fans down its very long history to make it one of if not THE greatest RTS-defining franchises in gaming history.Command and Conquer universe - with the exception of CNC Renegade (an FPS based in the tiberium universe) - has been defined by base building, resource management, resource collection, base defense, tactical decisions and heavy strategy that have molded playstyles that have blown away other RTS games, and even set the precedent on what to beat for the entire RTS gaming industry.Command and Conquer Generals and its extension Zero Hour, STILL have a loyal fan base, online community and very extensive modding community that, years on, is still loyally playing a game they've had for ages, completely ignoring anything NEW you try to produce. Most true CNC fans will buy CNC4 because its command and conquer, but will NEVER play it after the first few times logging in.But, for now i shall leave you with the following review of CNC4 Tib Twilight:For what it is, it's a good, fun game.Good Graphics.Good gameplay.Good story.Good skirmish modes.Challenging AI.But these do not excuse it. It is NOT command and conquer, and for this reasonI DO NOT CONSIDER THIS GAME, CNC4 TIBERIAN TWILIGHT, TO BE CANON TO THE CNC FRANCHISE.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			",56,7,2,10,9,0,27

												Why fix what ain't broken? Seriously. EA killed the series. Cons: 1. No base building/ tiberium harvesting= loss of the rts feel. What I mean by this is that 4 is more for the starcraft spam multiplayer than anyone else. Without base building or real tiberium harvesting where every purchase is much more impacting in the long meta of a mission, everything here becomes a rock paper scissors contest of what you can deploy to counter 1 to 2 enemy crawlers. Without base building the story also seems totally rushed.2. The story is terrible. Either way you end up really lossing and with the worst cliff hanger that implies EA not progressing the story past this game. Its like we began with Turtledove, rich in universe detail and description with Tiberium Dawn thru tiberium sun while forgoing character development. then in 3 we hit an SM Stirling kind of narrative with really indepth background about the universe, annecdotes about characters like Havoc from Renegade, and crazy battlefields like red zones and yellow. Then we hit this...this slop. If you are here for the story I suggest you find it elsewhere for Tiberium Twilight will make you hate yourself. 3. Multiplayer is stupid unbalanced due to unit unlocks versus experience. If you're a new player online prepare to have your first majority of battles to be like Dark Souls; lots of death and much frustration as you have tier I and maybe tier II while your opponent has tier III and more. It's going to be a bad time. hint just rush support. Air OP. 4. Still too expensive for how bad it is. Pros: 1. Kane is back. Kane backstabs GDI. 2. Scrin towers actually are explained.3. Missions are generally quick.			",57,14,0,18,26,1,48

												A disgrace to the C&C series. Do not buy it! Even if they offer if for a free weekend, the price is too high for its worth. What made this game so crappy? The gameplay, the story, and the idea of taking away the concept of base building and resource gathering. Every fan knows the story of GDI vs NOD. GDI's purpose is to contain the Tiberium and stop NOD from using it as a tool. NOD wants the tiberium to claim it as the next step in human evolution while informing the world that GDI are a bunch of fascists that care for the rich and abandon the sick and poor. BUT C&C4 throws that all away when Kane uses the Tacitus, the item that the 2 factions fought so hard to obtain and unlock the secrets of it, to ally with GDI and destroy the Tiberium that infested the earth. I bought it because i love C&C from the start of playing red alert. After Westwood was gone, it all went down the drain. C&C3 was good, but aliens?! blah! I would have loved to see CABAL come back, but EA made up for it with Kane's Wrath. But this...this is like a giant middle finger to all the C&C fans from EA.			",199,7,1,18,11,2,43

												Command and Conquer what happened to you. You used to be the king of RTS. Your cheesy live action cut-scenes were the stuff of legend and we eagerly anticipate your every release.Now what have you done to yourself? No resources, no armies, no bases? What is this? A shadow of what used to be?YOU ARE NOT COMPANY OF HEROES!Why can't you stay the way you used to be? We all loved you and cherished every memory of you? Why do you have to cheapen what we have?Why? WHY? WHY?!It is difficult for me to articulate my feelings about Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight. All I really know is, I don't like it.In some misguided attempt by what I can only assume is an ill-informed marketing department somewhere deep in the bowels of the EA mega structure this installment of the Command & Conquer franchise changes everything about the previous games. They even went so far as to remove the live action cut-scenes that, despite being where B-movie stars go to die, had become a benchmark in the industry.You no longer build bases or harvest Tiberium, instead you get allocated a number of points that can be spent on units, when a unit die you get your points back and can try a new combination. It takes what used to be a very balanced RTS experience and turns it into an entirely micromanagement experience, and not a terribly good one at that.This is not unlike what you might see in the later Dawn of War games but where Dawn of War balanced it with RPG elements making each unit seem important here you are just sending mindless, faceless entities towards a bunch of other mindless, faceless entities in the hope of beating the map objective before you mind rots from the monotone boredom.Command & Conquer might be viewed by many as the classic simple RTS, but it was the one that monopolized the best on that approach and it was the franchise that more than any other made the real time strategy genre a force to be reckoned with.Now it is nothing more a boring mediocre clone of a game, trying to do with all the other cool new RTS's are doing but not doing it nearly as well and losing what made the game special in the first place in the attempt.It is a sad end for what was once such a proud franchise. The older Command & Conquer games will forever hold a special place in my heart but this makes me hope the series will die before another abomination is released.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Sooooo............. C&C 4: Tiberian Twilight..........I've have been a C&C fan since I was 4, aka from 1998. The first game was perhaps the first game I have ever got and was the series that got me into both gaming and real time strategy games. So as you can see, when I heard abotu C&C 4, I was prepared to enbark on a good bye party for my beloved franchise. However, I had to scrap it when a leaked beta information on the gameplay changes the game was gonna make. Therefore I avoided the game like the plague. Once the game was finally released, did I feel guilty of having to abandon the party?Apparently not cause not only did the reviews show little discouragement but 98% of all the C&C fans like me cryout in anger for the series. Obviously this game recommendation from me was Hell no (and I'll repeat it again at the end for those who are too lazy to read this and skips to the end. So why is the game bad? Well the first problem is the gameplay. The gameplay in terms of C&C gameplay felt like it was design by satan. Rather than traditional gameplay where you would collect resources and build both a base and an army to conquer your enemies, the game went Moba like based game with a unusual population limit (which drew me away from the game) and a requirement of playing from other people. Another thing that the game is known to have been hated on is the story. Now I haven't played the campaign but from what I heard, it's a cluster f*(k. So is there one thing I like about the game? well......... I do actually enjoy the music which is actually pretty good.In conclusion, if it wasn't for C&C being in the game, it could have been ok, but the C&C is a perminate damage to the game for I have to say I do not recommend the gameFor people who want to skip to the conclusion on whether to own the game or not, the answer is HELL NO.

												So I am a massive fan of the Command and conquer games and I heard about this game and simply had to try it, something i regret. First off this is not a sequal to an amazing game this is barley even command and conquer. There is no base building, no resource gathering, the community is dead, and this game is SO over priced its not even worth your time as a F2P game, and im one of the suckers that got tricked into buying it for 20 bucks, yeah i feel real stupid, please please please do not buy this game take that 20 dollars and buy one of the previous games in the series that is a true command and conquer game this is not CnC this is EAs attempt to squeeze as much money out of a game as they possibly can. And wtf is wrong with the Super dedicated Rock Paper Sissors style of units? it would be fine if they had COUNTER UNITS that could take on 2 diffrent types at once but there isn't its all just one unit ment to counter another no versatility and that breaks the game it means you just wasted alot of time building one type of unit to counter what you thought the enemy had only to realize he changed his army and before you say OH JUST BUILD A BUNCH OF DIFFRENT UNITS that won't work because you really do need an army of one type of unit to have any impact on the enemy, you could use that stratigy like i tried to but it simply fell apart and i was fighting bots at the time, the class system was interesting for 2 minutes till i found out aggressive support or campy defense is the best way to win. Here are my pros and consPros (the few the proud)Its a newer take on a stratigy game.It adds new units to the game.Works well enough with friends.I had no lag issues and minimal game crashs.Fast unistall.Cons (here we go)Nothing like any of the other CnC games so I simply can't label it as CnC.There are no counter units meaning you just have to guess what the enemy is building and build units accordingly.No base building and no resource gathering which is the corner stone of the CnC universe in terms of gameplay.Some units are either broken op or so underwelming its just stupid (like the commandos that used to be badass).Its way over priced.Gameplay is increadably repetative.Graphics are subpar to say the least.The story is the weakest the CnC series has ever had.If you do play with people its either a steam rolling support that focuses damage or rushing assault. There is no balancing in my opinion between the classes. No more fight the enemy to the death its now just who can get the most points by capturing points of intrest around the map ( the very limited amounts of maps).Slow install.SummaryEA once again found a series everyone loved and worrshipped and decided to destroy is for the sake of money the game is simply not fun its over priced its not CnC, I understand a game needs to evolve but you do need to keep those core elements in the game that make it that game something the devs don't understand and btw at this point in time the game is hacker central so if you do for some reason decide to buy this game have fun with that. 2/10 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

												Shocking that this can even be called a Command & Conquer game. I heard about how bad it was, but decided to buy it since it was on sale for $5. It is atrocious. All the base building aspects are gone, instead you are given a ""crawler"" which you can set up and produce certain units and structures/abilities depending on if you chose offense, defense or support. I only suggest buying this if you hated previous C&C games since this is the complete opposite of past games. I plan on finishing the campaign, on easy to get it done with faster, and to never play it again.EDIT: You may enjoy the game if you liked World in Conflict's multiplayer aspect. The whole game plays like it, where you are forced to pick a strategy and stick with it. However, it is more limited because in World in Conflict you could still make most units, however in this game you are forced to only make what your strategy allows. There is no overlap at all.

												This game is just a grind.  You have to work to permanently unlock things that you would generally unlock and upgrade every game in previous installments of the game, so if you play online you're guarenteed to get steamrolled by someone who has played longer.The game offers different spawn ships that only allow certain units to be built with each and are supposed to follow certain playstyles but ultimately just end up limiting the game and the amount of fun it could have offered.I love the C&C series, but this game has had some horrible decisions go into it.  If you want an RTS, I'd reccomend picking up either C&C Tiberium Wars 3: Kane's Wrath, or C&C Red Alert 3, as both are top notch games from the same series, and infinitely better than this waste of code.

												When i was young i played C&C and seeing it on steam made me remember those times way back when...Games back then were made to keep you there and were well crafted to give the player a feeling of accomplishment after you beat each level.-breaths inTHIS P.O.S. REMINDS ME OF HOW BAD GAMES GET AFTER A BEATIFUL SERIES GOES UNDER!what happened to building your base up and and having to mine for resorces while being gunned down by your enimies. what happened to kane being the coolest vilian ever in C&C. what happened to the stratagy that was suppose to be in this game. why do i hvae to level up to use my whole arsenal. why did they disable wasd as the camera controls, using the mouse and having to use shortcuts without having a place to start from on the keyboard sucks. the graphics are cool but why would developers EVER put graphics befor the story or game play.this game is a flop and should just be buried along with E.T. in a big landfill.this game is a horrible sequal to a grand series.this game is the killer of the C&C Series.the only way out is to make another red alert and the third one was pushing it. besides we are tired of red alert and ww2 based games; or at least i am.good bye C&C this game just ended our relationship.

												Tiberian Twilight does not deserve the Command & Conquer title. It's a chugging slow C&C wannabe with kindergarten storyline, irritating and clumsy interface, and a huge learning curve even if you've played the series from day 1. Also dont expect to be able to play AT ALL if for some reason you're unable to connect to the internet. While C&C3 kept me busy for hundreds of hours, this one made me feel complelled to leave mid mission, before my first hour was up. I'll need to be seriously drunk or delirious to try this one again.			",182,22,8,19,4,1,22

												A kick in the teeth to the Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars series. If there was an actual story at all, it was more bland than a box of uncooked rice. The pvp system is absolute crap, and you will find yourself needing to be carried to even begin to be able to fight with one specific class of army at a time. Because to hell with unit diversity.This was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of the RTS genre, and frankly I want to set my copy on fire, but since it's digital, I guess a giant thumbs down works.

												I have been a lifelong CnC fan, but this game really screwed up the formula rather than innovate it. The lack of base building or resource gathering means that the game is just a mad rush to build as may units as possible, throw them at the enemy, and repeat. Only one of the classes can build defenses. the leveling up system means that you are grossly underpowered in multiplayer matches until you grind up to the top. This complelety destroys the balance as you could only have access to tanks while your opponent is using Mastadons. Also, the story and the acting is awful. It's college level bad.

I will say having been and still a CNC fan and supporter and have played then from the CNC, and RA  to this CNC3  and RA2  and the exp packs i was well entertained and very happy with the series as a hole then came this steaming pile of code.... this is a true example of GIGO  (Garbage in garbage out). i suffered through this jest to get the story line. of which was also disappointing. Dont waste your money on this..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible. Absolutely the worst C&C game ever made, without a doubt, I don't know how EA could make C&C 3 so incredibly amazing and then do a couplete U-turn and make this. This may well be the worst game I have ever had the misfortune to play. I paid under £5 for this and it was still too much. I feel like EA should be paying us to play this.The ""always-online"" that EA has a big hard-on for lately is a nightmare.The only reason I bought this was to concluce the CnC tiberium storyline and even that was terrible. Did you know there's no more tiberium in this game? Literally, it's pretty much all gone. No base building, no harvesting resources. You can train units without any cost but only up to a very, very limited unit cap. I'm talking REAL limited. Like you can only train enough units to have a decent attack force or a decent defense force. Not both. I expect that kind of limit on a console RTs but not PC.DONOTBUY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a big fan of the C&C series I had big hopes for this game based on the previous episodes. It's a complete disappointment, it's absolutely different than the previous games, they took everything from it that made it C&C, no base building, no money, lack of story and proper games modes... The only thing I can mention as positive is the graphics.If you are thinking about buying it, let me give you an advice: Do NOT buy it!			",63,13,1,8,5,0,8

												Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight (C&C4) is the lackluster follow up and conclusion to the beloved Tiberium storyline of the Command and Conquer series. While crucial for story-enthused players, C&C4 breaks up the traditional base building and attempts to create a rank-based multiplayer game. The constant mobility leaves you feeling that every mission is a commando-based offshoot and fails to satisfy classic real-time strategy fans. The ranked multiplayer makes most matches feel unbalanced, but  there are opportunities for co-op gameplay. All in all, C&C4 leaves much to be desired in every aspect, but the game still holds the conclusion to the series.			",339,112,2,23,21,4,34

They took most of what i loved about the other games and tossed it in a blender. No base building, No creation of giant forces, and no tiberium mining. Plus to worsen the game more they threw the story into the blender as well, the story was short, stupid, and made a terrible ending to the tiberium seires of command and conquer.

												Pretty much as bad as you have heard. The campaign is a very brief set of 17 missions, 3 tutorial and 7 each for GDI/Nod. The story is on par with a cheesy Sci-fi Channel movie and is largely the same for both factions. Gameplay's not terrible once you get used to it, but it's pretty boring.  The main challenge is the incredibly small unit cap which in turn leads to an incredibly small army. This is exacerbated by the bonus units found on most maps which are counted in the cap and can put you over the cap. So if a crucial unit like the repair Engineer is lost you can wind up in a situation where you have to self-destruct 2 or more units to replace 1 that was destroyed. You also have to ""level up"" in order to access the higher tier units even in the single player, though in practice most of the bonus units are the powerful tier 3 so this is more inconvenient than anything.

												EA screwed up big time on this one. They failed the developers who had built an moderately interesting fast-paced RTS game that really had nothing to do with C&C and slapped the brand name on it, hoping it might sell to some hardcore C&C fans. The game itself never got the chance it might have deserved, because it could never be judged on its own merits but always as ""The Conclusion to the Tiberium Saga"".They failed the fans of the previous games, because they delivered something that did not understand the value of the gameplay of all the previous titles and threw out time-honored traditions just for the sake of cleaning house.They even managed to fail the brand itself. If EA has to send out an email that ensures ""fans"" that they have brought back resource harvesting, removed unit caps and similar basic fundamantals, then it is very clear that the brand itself have lost tremendous value and C&C4 almost solely bears that whole responsibility.Overall this game fails, not because of what it is, but for what it sets out to be.

												Really disappointed.. I bought this without reading anything about it. How the hell did they remove base building and still call it command and conquer, that's literally the best part of C&C, this is just trash.. utter trash. Whoever worked on this game should be completely ashamed of what they did to this franchise. Who the hell signed off on this. Absolutely disappointed.			",54,15,0,7,10,2,6

												Fraudulent. A mockery.This game isn't as bad as they say it is ... it's worse!!! :( Like me, you might think ""It's C&C. how bad can it be?"" Answer: world-class bad. A complete corruption of the art form by people who don't understand the first thing about what made C&C cool and different from other RTSes, and have ruined the franchise. Highlights: no more concept of ""economy"" or ""base-building""; plodding, ineffectual units; linear ""progression"" of uninspired unlocks, meanwhile each faction can build fewer units -- not to mention structures -- than ever before; and of course a laughable ""story"".  C&C has ""wives"" in it now, did u know?Overall, it just exudes that particular EA-Games flavor of disgust. $5 I wish I had back, and the bottom line: wherever you may rate this game on the scale from ""just plain"" bad to ""seriously I can't believe how bad it is"" bad, your time is most assuredly better spent elsewhere.Disclaimer: I never met a C&C I didn't like. ( .................... up until RA3 which, questionable as it may be, is still infinitely more playable and ""C&C"" than /this/ POS.)			",421,51,12,29,35,1,87

Thay took all that C&C stand for and trow it away.No base building, no resource gathering and Scrin whas gone even if i whas not that huge fan of them geting in Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars. But taking out the main core of the game and re-build the game to have walkers making units for you and tiberium nodes and crystals that give you upgrade points. The lvl system for unlocking units and upgrades is not good for a singelplayer or multiplayer.I do not recommend that anyone buy this game even if thay are a C&C hardcore fans.

												As a fan of the original Tiberian Sun C&C game I expected this remake to be at least as good as the original.  It is TERRIBLE!!!!  The fun in C&C games, because they seem not to have understood it,  is to be able to build strong defenses and large bases, outposts and a solid economy ?!? With the machanics of this version, it is absolutly IMPOSSIBLE to accomplish, at all!!!  This thing with the crystals to gain access to slight advantages absolutly sucks.  You need to play many hours before gaining access to 50% of the units available using only boring to play and weak mech_infantry units.  From my point of view, they would rather keep the unit layouts and apply the game mechanics of the provious version...  At least it would be playable.  What a rubbish!!!  DO NOT BUY THAT, unless 1-2$, very frustrating game!!!			",30,4,0,16,23,0,46

												For anybody who loved the older Command and Conquer games: STAY AWAY! Command and Conquer 4 strays so far from the original Command and Conquer formula that it is virtually unrecognizable as a Command and Conquer game. Gone is the base building and resource gathering, replaced with a ""mobile crawler"" and a rather stifling hard ""population cap"" as well as a need to gather experience to unlock other units. What Electronic Arts was thinking when they put this one together is beyond me, and while it may have been a good game on its own, it's not a Command and Conquer game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Very few people can say anything bad about the Tiberian series. Then there is this ball of rot. Looks bad, terrible story, horrible voice acting. Is this even a Command & Conquer game? People used to say C&C Generals was bad. I doubt anything could be as bad as this game. My advice? Don't buy this game, and if it's free....don't even bother taking it. Just say NO.

												a poor rendition of a command and conquer game, and this is coming from a hardcore fan.the campaign is extremely short, far from engaging and the story line is lacklustre. it lacks the depth of its predecessors and i believe has fallen foul of the trend of many games as of latethey have spent far too much time trying to make it look nice that they have forgotton what C&C is abouti would recommend red alert 2 any day of the week as still being the best command and concquer game			",82,4,2,17,1,0,15

												This game is an abomination to man. Everyone involved in the development process ought to be taken out back and shot in the head. Every programmer who worked on this game should have his fingers chopped off and be forced to watch as his/her wife/husband is subjected to the torture that is playing this game. The lead game designer placed in charge of this project should have his eyes gouged out and replaced with the testicles of a rhinoceros. All studios working under EA should be permenantly embargoed by the free and civilized nations of the world to ensure that an atrocity like this never happens again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game.  I enjoyed the other games in the C&C Tiberium universe, and the setting feels like a good continuation of that... but I just cannot get past the gameplay.  Screenshots and videos might be staged to make this look like it plays like other C&C games, but it really does not.  There is a big focus on small unit tactics, limited armies, micro-management, and territory control.  In truth, this would not make a bad PvP skirmish game, with short session times and persistant leveling to build an army.  Sadly, this model does not fit well with a single player campaign game, particularly if one expects a more traditional C&C experience.  I might recommend this if you just wanted a skirmish game, but odds are anyone who wants that experience will go looking for something more dedicated to that purpose.  Anyone who comes to this looking for a traditional C&C game will come away disappointed.  I cannot recommend this title without major, major caveats.			",369,178,5,66,49,5,58

												Biggest waste of money ever. They have changed the way you play the game completely. No more resource gathering, the aim of the game is no longer to destroy the other players but to capture points and also, you are forced to have a time limit and a point limit. Oh and you can't build bases anymore too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I stongly dislike the game. it is a bad contrabution to the C&C trillogy. They cut out resorce collection and replace it with an abatrary ""command point system"" that limits you to a group of units so laughably small that its not worth training in the first place. you can destroy your own units to free up command points, but the enemy can destroy (most of the time will) these decomissioned troops while they are doing what i can only assume is dragging a katana slowly through their torso.The campain is♥♥♥♥♥♥and the only challange in it is that you are faced with threats that merely outnumber you and most of the time are completely without strategy. Roughly 90% of the campain are training missions that would even make the most incometant of workers face palm with I already know that frustration. They divide up units into classes of offence, defence, and suport. This makes most unit combonations impossable without help from a friend or the use of two computers and copys of the game at once. You can only use one mcv at any given time and there are detecated mcv's for each class (also no scrin which makes both me and my brother frustrated). The upgrades which are bought with tiberium (which the collection of is now tedious and frustrating) which any unit can transport and must be delivered to deployment zones that the mcvs are deployed from. the only deploy zones are on the top/bottom of the map or in the very small patches that are hard to maintain control of (it dosent help that transportation of tiberum slows your unit to a grinding halt). The upgrades are mostly useless like the mcv cloak as almost all units are stealth detectors.All in all EA messed up This game. 0/10 dissapointed fans.			",104,11,1,13,15,1,10

												If you are a C&C fan from the early days, and didn't jump on the band wagon around the release of Red Alert 3, then do not touch this game with a 50ft barge poll. It is the biggest waste of time and the multiplayer is horrifyingly painful to even look at. I love C&C for its base building with very little restriction, the units and the stroyline, this game has none of that. The ending of the story was a disaster as well. If you were like me and were dying to see the end of the Tiberium story line, just watch the GDI and NOD endings on YouTube and you'll save yourself the time and pain of it all.			",83,5,0,2,7,1,25

												The game itself plays very differently from the other C&C games and it seems like not everyone is a fan of it. Like the game play or no, do not buy this game. I was only able to play this during the first installation and when I had to reinstall the game again, I keep getting prompted that my ""CD KEY is already used"" and am unable to play it every since. Also, it has EA's signature horrible online DRM so even don't think that you can play this offline when EA pulls support for this game.In short, if it's an EA game and has online DRM, you say NO to it.

												seriously the most terrible game i own, thankfully i got it on sale so I didn't waste too much money. here's an idea EA, if you have a new idea and direction you want to go, make a completely new series, don't screw with what works. You ruined the series with this one piece of crap. my friends and I have sat around and tried to figure out how to make this game worse, we couldn't come up with anything. Q.W.O.P. is a better, more thought out, less buggie, more enjoyable game, and it is free and online. You crapped the bed with this one EA.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i get what ea's trying to do by mixing stuff up in order to ""revolutionize"" the genre, but really they murdered it and took away the one thing that made command and conquer unique and fun: base building.sometimes its better that things dont change and stay the way they are instead of changing stuff around so much.multiplayer is complete garbage and skirmish isn't as fun as other CNC, havent touched campaign. soundtrack's alright (especially Nod's)offense is basically if you wanna kill people. i like playing support because aircraft and support powers. as for defense its the closest thing you'll get to base building since basically your crawler is your mobile, terrible base. expect to play a LOT of games in order to get all the high tier units and level up. yeah....

												They ruined it by calling it C&C. Nevertheless the gameplay itself is good, fresh and quite challenging. It's a fast paste RTS with a lot of micromanagement and much more strategy as you might think. The leveling system and the low player base could be better but after all, i recommend it for the sake of the game, not for the name.			",77,3,2,7,10,0,23

												This is not your typical C&C by any means, the rumors say that this was EA's attempt to push C&C to eSports, but because market was overwhelmed by MOBAs and other quality RTS games, they decided to slap 4 and ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE story on it to lure in loyal C&C fans, and the final product we have now does look and play exactly like it was initially planned to be. The only reason i give this game a positive rating is because i had a tons of fun and positive memories playing it with my friends in coop/compstomp and just skirmish with AI. If you play this game without thinking about past C&C games, it's actually fine, runs great, plays great, looks great. Let's do a breakdown :Reasons to buy it ( only if it's on huge sale and you are desperate ) : - Tons of fun in COOP with friends or vs AI alone. - Very pretty environmental/map design. - Sometimes it's very challenging. - Visuals. - 5v5 players possible.Reasons to avoid it and tell me that i am stupid for giving it a positive rating : - Abysmal plot written by a madman in a few hours. Probably taken from DeviantArt fanfiction section. - Questionable units design. - Horrible FMV actors performance. - There is almost no way to beat campaign alone, it's designed to be beaten in COOP. - Unit cap. - Has almost nothing to do with C&C, hence no base building or tiberium harvesting. - The ending cutscene ( which is the finale of whole C&C series presumably ) is so horrible that you might want to kys after it. - Most of the super/special weapons feel weak. - You need to unlock units in order to use them.If reasons to avoid it don't scare you + it's on a huge sale and you have a friend to play it with - then you might want to get it just for collection and full playthrough with people you know. If you're looking for extra content for it - don't. Game doesn't have mod support, but it does have few custom maps.But if you want some more good old C&C - don't get it, it's not C&C, it won't be fun for you, infact it might leave you with few dead brain cells, just like me.

												It would be hard to say whether this game shall be recommended or not, I will say 5/10. BUT DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON IT. Pros:-Fun new units and elements to test and greater visuals comparing to CC3. The plot may be too short but is reasonable. Blue tiberium core upgrades are fun to try out. -Great, epic music.Cons:-Cartoonish visual effects, an unpleasant retrogress to the realistic CC3 feeling.-Very short campaign length. The only bonus campaign require preorder, but it was 6 years ago and unable to download or purchase via DLC. -Scrins did not come back as it was assumed, which disappointed many players. -Gaming balance is totally destroyed. Weapon types have be significantly simplified and units turned out to be lot harder to kill, which require lesser micros and strategies for good matches. -Need no resource to produce units. It is a very controversial change, as it makes no sense.-Require online network for gaming, but afaik EA is going to shut it down someday nevertheless.Personally I do not disagree with this new yet controversial building quenes applied in this game, but producing units without the need of resources simply won't make sence for gaming balance and result in lot of TR vs. TRGuess EA won't continue on CC anymore.

Basically you don't build bases and units, you pick combinations of units that just unlimited spawn from your bases with a unit cap. This style is feels like the worst possible cobination in an RTS. Ruined the CnC franchise for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am 28. I experienced most Westwood titles (c&c 1 / ra 1 ...) and this is by far, the worst in the serie but not only that, it manages to be THE biggest disappointment in the RTS history:Gradually when went like => C&C 3/ Kanes Wrath (great) => Red Alert 3 (average) => RA3: Uprising (horrible) => C&C 4 (TERRIBLE).In short: No more base building, Joe Kucan (Kane) doesn't act that well anymore and is an hero (... after being the anti-hero for 15 years...), no defensive strategies (you need to capture points and thus need to go all-on offensive else you lose)...So many failures in such a great franchise.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

												I think this game isn't so bad as it is described in reviews (although some bugs make me agree with them). Advantages: quite interesting (though too short) company, epic soundtrack, variety of units that allows to use different strategies. Disadvantages: dull skirmish, restrictions in units' gap, to open hi-tech units it is necessary to spend a lot of time in a game, lack of third-party. So the game is worth of purchase only on sale and bundled with other games of the series since its is strongly overpriced, and in my opinion this game is only for fans of C&C. And yeah, the game is required to create an account if you don't have it, don't buy this game as it is already impossible to create it. (5/10)			",38,1,0,7,3,0,22

												I personally do not find this game to be that bad, besides a few moments in the campaign that made me mad, there really havent been to many problems with the game. The idea of classes is interesting to me, and each one adds variety to the missions and multiplayer. While i do miss the base building, there isnt much to make me hate the gameplay. The story is where i'm a bit unhappy, as it feels lacking to me. I can understand the hate this game recieves, but also can say that there was a lot to live up to in comparison to Tiberium Wars and Kanes Wrath, but will definitely say that this game is nowhere near awful to me.

												Besides what most people say, I like this. Ok, maybe it was a really bold step to go with such a new concept in a so well known and well established game series. The story of Kain is finished with this one, with an ending I really can approve. The singleplayer is also playable in coop, which makes in a little bit too easy in my opinion.The multiplayer is still challenging, because you get to coordinate in larger teams. The game is fast and the two factions are well balanced.			",329,81,4,42,21,7,79

												I actually quite enjoyed playing this despite the bad publicity it has. Yes, EA do what they typically do and use a name to sell a game that's completely different from what is expected of it. It probably should have been an offshoot instead of a sequel. If you can ignore that then it's not that bad of a game and has no serious technical problems.The game is basically just dumbed down and casualised RTS that's good for playing for 30 minutes. All the more complex aspects such as base and resource management are thrown away leaving you with the job of looking after 1 master unit, the Crawler. You collect Tiberium crystals to receive upgrade points and when the Crawler is destroyed it respawns at a drop off point. The Defense type can construct buildings but only buildings such as the Obelisk and Nuke/Ion Cannon which require the Crawler to be alive to operate. Support buildings can also be captured but cannot be destroyed.I completed the campaign and played some skirmishes. The skirmish mode is a little shallow and some extra customization would have made it much better such as increasing the unit limit for games with more players. I'm going to give it a thumbs up for that at least. If you want or expect a traditional C&C experience then don't get it and stick to C&C 3 or the older games.			",50,7,0,2,2,2,4

												If you love the C&C series like I do, dont buy this game. Lately EA games seems to like taking their games in a ""new direction"" where they remove what the fans really loved about their favourite series (see also: Sims 3). So because of this it feels like your not playing a C&C game anymore. But im not saying that its terrible for being different just that its become something it never should have been. The best way to describe this game is that it would be a great E-sport game.See alsoWarhammer 40,000: Dawn of war II			",543,127,8,73,57,4,103

												As an avid RTS player CnC 4 strays from traditional RTS games and focus's on action.  The game has some RPG elements to it which you can cap within 10 hours of non stop playing.  The dev's did away with base building and resource gathering instead you get a crawler similar to a command center which is mobile.  It creates all your units.  You get 3 crawlers to choose from either side.  Support, Offense and Defense each class has it's own unique unit's and abilities.  At first I enjoyed this game.  But removing resources and base's takes away a huge elemnet of why enjoy RTS games to begin with.  No economy to manage and no real ""home"" to protect 2 factors which add depth to RTS's.  Being able to manage those and your army add's alot to the gameplay and I miss it when playing this game.  If you don't appreciate those things in RTS's and prefer to get right into the action then this game is for you.  But not so much for me.  I bought it mainly to see the conclusion to the storyline. 6/10			",152,7,2,23,22,0,37

												I would recommend this game for a few reasons only. First off the gameplay is NOTHING like any other C&C game, there is no base building, no resource collection, and no big strategy.  This game does have a good story line to it, I’ll give them that, and that's why I recommend this game.  Most people love games not for the gameplay or graphics, but for the story line, and this game has a good story line.  This game may be nothing like any other C&C game, and that’s another reason why I would recommend it, it's new, not just a knockoff of the other games, it's different, and some may hate that, I don't like it but I respect that they tried something new.Now if you’re new to Command and Conquer let me say I would not recommend this game to you, if you want to get into this franchise then try out C&C Generals, or if you looking for something on Steam, then try Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars.

												My overall rating 4 out of 5 starsHonestly i don't understand why this game got such bad reviews. At no point are you ever forced into multiplayer, like one of the previous reviews said. I've been playing the campaigns and did a few skirmish maps with the AI to level my profile. Which does lead into one partial negative. That being the near necessity of playing one of the campaigns before you start skirmish modes. Apperently the unlocks are tied to yoru profile rank which is persistant in the campaign and skirmish. Game play's not really that aweful as some have described. It's more of a elite squad based kind of strategy take on C&C. That may be off putting to some, but you do have a ""base building"" option with the defense crawler. Just don't expect massive bases like in C&C3. I did find myself useing the offensive crawlers a little bit more than i would have liked.So the story lines a little anti climactic. Sadly given that it's the end of the series, it would have been near impossible to have actually finished it properly for the majority of the fan base. So i can't fault it for that, though i do find fault in how the cutscenes follow through. It's like there are parts missing. That being said, if you run both campaigns, you'll get alot of the plot holes filled in by the opossite campaign.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but when i get a chance, i'll add that review.

After getting your eyes replaced with plot devices, you must decide between siding with Kain, Grand Poobah of the Brotherhood of Mod, many of them have been lead astray by such evils as skyrim JRPG mods. However, Commander Crazy Black Lady refuses to see the good MOD can bring to humanity so she kills your wife after you agree to side with her to ensure your loyalty.So after you fail to pay your phone bill so you can't call your homies at PDA to tell them to stop shooting, you kill them and then regardless of whichever path you take, Commodore Baldington says ""F*** this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm going into space"" and then he goes into Space, the end.

The game also has the best units in the game locked behind a level wall buuuttt the leveling was made me play for as long as i did and the voice acting is nice tooo.

												Behold disciples of Nod, for the end is soon upon us. Electronic Arts’ award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series’ history.It is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this ""Tiberium Control Network"" without GDI’s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.After 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world’s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.With a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience.

												Its a fine game. Its not as fun as the old command and conquers but it gets more right then wrong...kind of. it has good graphics,fun multiplayer, decent combat but suffers from some problems like how every unit is a tank, the awful rock paper system, the story is....just the worse and there are just most units that are there just to fill a requirement rather than bring fun new tatics. The game also has the best units in the game locked behind a level wall buuuttt the leveling was made me play for as long as i did and the voice acting is nice tooo. Oh the game also has drm which means it can't be a classic like its predecessor's.Its ok but very underrated.5/10 average			",18,1,0,5,1,0,3

												I can only recommend this if your a true fan of the sries and want to see the last of the Tiberium Saga.  While its not a bad game in its own right it defies a lot of typical conventions that C&C has had since its inception in 1995.    However if we forget that this is a C&C game and judge it on its own merits.  I'll say this, first its a fast paced game and unlike  previous C&C games it requires you to think about using your units right as each unit now has a strength/weakness mechanic more so in this title.Graphics wise its visual fideltiy is pretty impressive for an RTS game and even though the ammount of units you can have is limited the battles do in fact feel big, which is a plus.  As this is a C&C game you can expect well acted real time cutscenes and these are the most impressive I'vse seen so far.Now for problems.  One of the major issues is that players can level up outside multiplayer and then take that rank/level into multiplayer, meaning there's no sense of progression and someonne can just anhilate you in multiplayer because you've not unlocked all the units/upgrades.Bottom line this can be a fun title if you can forget it has anything to do with Command and Conquer, but it also appeals to true fans.  Generic RTS fans may want to avoid this title.  Which is the only reason I can recommend this title.			",239,13,0,15,27,0,45

												I think the devs really did an astounding work on this game, bringing it a completely new engine and game design which is why some people love it and some hate it. I personally love the game's way of playing it, constantly making you play as if you really are always on the battlefield, rather than just turtling up and waiting for your superweapon to get ready so you can bombard the enemies and win the game easily. No, this game makes you think and strategize way more than any other strategy game, and its' micro-manage-enducing gameplay will grab anyone on the spot, who is a fan of games such as chess (like me) where you have to think 2-3 moves ahead.The only problem - the title. It shouldn't be a C&C game, it ruined the game's reputation while it could've been incredible to have a classic old strategy which gathered everything good about every C&C so far, the devs tried something new and now they're the bad guys for it ?  Buy this game if you wanna try something new and refreshing !			",267,33,10,24,12,4,45

												Don't listen to the people who say this game sucks. C&C4 is a legitimate step forward in RTS mechanics, distilling the fun of what you used to call ""base building"" in the game's offense/defense/support crawlers. I picked Defense and played through the campaign. Guess what, it's anything but ""Defense."" If you could call crawling up in the enemy lines, plopping down defense towers and bunkers next to their♥♥♥♥♥♥ and letting your therefore heavily shielded infantry tear everyone up, ""defense."" The game shows that there is pretty much no need for RTS games to go through the traditional stages of build-up and then push. In this game, you just push. Or get pushed. All day. Can't take it, well, there's Starcraft for you people who like having to memorize tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t before actually playing the game.See, there's a reason why people enjoy games like DOTA-like games. It's because they took the fun parts out of the RTS and put them in a game by itself. Give C&C4 some credit for doing the same thing but for base building, army composition, and micro. In time you guys are going to look at games like C&C4 as the first (though mis-advertised) baby steps toward actual computerized strategy games where it's easy to pick up and play but the strategy is really deep like chess and Go.

												So, I was in the break room at work one day, and there's this car insurance commercial on the television. Two co-workers are watching it, laughing to themselves over the absurdity that each insurance company claims to be the single best provider. ""They can't all be the best at the same time,"" says one. I agreed, adding that it's much like how each religion insists that it is the only true belief. I'm met with a look and, ""Well, I know I have the one true Word and the one true God."" I shrugged and said, ""Oh, I have State Farm.""Long story short? Never, ever play C&C4:TT. It's more awkward than discussing religion at the workplace and rarely ends with such a quippy anecdote.

												Do not get this game. It's an awful, terrible, extremely sad neuterization of the C&C series.Given that you still think you may like it, consider this: In order to actually do anything (multiplayer) you must unlock units. You start with a whopping 3 total uinits: light infantry, light vehicle and tank. All of which are completely worthless if you play against someone who has, for some reason, put time into the game. And that is just scratching the surface of the problems!Even if this product is on sale for 90% off, avoid it at all costs.			",230,15,2,38,26,1,42

												The first... IDK.. Dozen or so games were great.  Red Alert was the first game I ever played all the way through as a kid.  Once upon a time C&C was selling a first decade collection, those are all great games.  But the franchise lost something in the last... well since RA2, whenever that was, that was the first C&C I got bored with before the end.  And this one... Trying to turn it into some sort of mmo hybrid?  Why does every game have to me open to be played with the world now, needing help from strangers to make progress?  I suppose this game could be fun to play as a LAN party, but I don't see any other way to make this game remotely fun.			",47,15,0,15,5,0,14

												Out of all of the Command & Conquer games I've played, this is the only one I've ever regretted buying. As it's shown through gameplay, it does NOT resemble the traditional build-up-your-base-and-army aspects seen in most of the previous games (Renegades is an FPS game). There's a limit on how much units you can use at one time. It's also not a destroy-the-enemy-base game anymore as it's more like a hold down points of the map type of game.However, the biggest disappointment I found would be the online portion. First, an internet connection is required at all times even if you're not playing online. Second, because there's a level up system which determines how much you can use (and both factions have separate level progresses), it limits a player's choices within the first hours or days of playing. Lastly, playing online can match people unfairly (players may have considerably large level gaps), leading to games where a new player doesn't have the units a higher level player does, especially powerful ones.If you're a player who has played CnC games throughout the years, it's likely you'll be disappointed with the change in gameplay mechanics. I really don't think this game is worth playing, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm saying ""don't buy it"". Buy it if you want, I'm just saying it's not worth it.			",54,3,0,8,4,0,8

												I have so many mixed emotions about this game.One of my biggest beefs with this game is that it's just plain short.  There are only 7 GDI missions,  7 NOD missions, and 3 common missions.  I finished it all in 14 hours.  Not much room in there for story.  The story they did have, and the cutscenes, seem very low budget and thrown together.  No Hollywood actors this time around.  The final cutscene in each campaign is literally the actors standing in front of a white sheet with a drawn picture.  If they had doubled the number of missions, I would be recommending this game.  It seems like they're trying to bring a lot of focus onto multiplayer, but I'm only interested in the single player aspect.One thing that took a little while to get used to is that they changed the gameplay style.  Previous C&C games have had the formula of building/defending/expanding a base, managing your economy and power, and trying to push out as many units as you can.  In this game, you have a fixed number of points that can be redeemed for units, another set of points for structures, and third set for skill upgrades and expanding your tech tree.  There are no power plants, harvesters, etc.  And if a unit is killed or a structure is lost, you get your points refunded, and can build it again.  A key strategy is to continually move your MCV forward, towards the goal.  This makes most of the maps very linear.  Once you can get past the dramatic difference in play style, the game actually gets enjoyable.  Though some of the time, it just feels like you're filling up your build queue so you can spam the enemy.With the new all-in-one MCV style, they added something that I thought was not well executed.  Instead of just one kind of MCV, they now have three:  offensive, defensive, and support.  Offensive is mostly for making units.  Defensive is for setting up structures like cannons and bunkers.  Support was totally useless to me, as it's for making repairs and setting up airstrikes.  The reason why this wasn't well executed is that you could only have one MCV at a time.  So you can't be defending a structure and attacking the enemy's MCV at the same time.			",103,11,0,1,3,0,11

												I bought this game to play with my roomates after we spent a year playing c&c 3 and Kanes Wrath. If you are looking at this thinking it is similar to the other games in the franchise, I beg you to run away. Exit steam and erase any evidence you looked at this game. The only good thing about it is that you get a good laugh from some of the cutscenes. I highly recomend C&C 3, Kanes Wrath, and even Red Alert 3, but I cannot recomend this game and sleep at night.

												My review is based on my personal experiences and with the background of having played and enjoyed Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars right before purchasing this game. It is to be said that this game and its dynamics, even the approach to it all, differ fundementally from the previous installment. The game is rather based on having mobile bases, not only encouraging of establishing only temporary bases, but even forcing you to hastly settle down only to for the most urgent actions and to move on in a giant caravan of units and your mobile command/construction building in order to survive. In the sense that [spoilers!] the planet is a Tiberian wasteland invaded by an Alien species in this installment, it gives off this nomadic post-apocalyptic feeling, which might be quite matching but hurt the gameplay experience in my opinion. Everything feels less permanent, rather like an action-packed campaign mission where your goal is not to build up a base and start offensives from there, but to utilize the little you have to outsmart your (in this case, also) mobile enemy.I personally love building up a base and having the responsibility of using terrains to defend its chokepoints and entrances. I was surprised and rather disappointed after playing the third installment just before this one. The graphics are less realistic and although this might have been the intention of the developers to return to the 'semi-comic'-feel, it felt sloppy and like being let down after CnC 3: Tiberium Wars.

												It is not often that I am disappointed and depressed by a video game but unfortunately C&C4 has got to be one of the most awful games I have ever had the misfortune to have played.  Before I start the criticism of the game, I feel that it would be fair to mention the one redeeming feature because there is only one and that is Joe Kucan reprising his role as Kane, about the only thing satisfying for a long time fan of the series such as myself.  Now on to the downsides.1. The complete lack of base building and resource gathering.  How you can even label this game as an RTS without these core elements is beyond me, instead of the staples of the RTS genre, units cost a certain amount of ""Command Points"" and that's it.  No tiberium, nothing to be gathered or collected or used tactically, just a limit placed on you at the start of the game and boom click a button, create units up to the limit and that's it, that's the extent of resources in the game.  And as for base building, much the same applies, you have a power limit so you place down a certain number of defensive turrets up to the limit and that's really all there is to it - on both fronts a complete lack of anything in-depth, evidence of a second rate game aimed at a minor market being shoe-horned into something much bigger than it actually is intended to be.2. The units/maps/graphics.  The units provided at the start of the game are weak and ineffectual so in order to obtain more units you level up and then unlock them which sounds like a fairly simple concept, that is until you realise that exp. for leveling up is difficult to come by.  The lack of exp. becomes apparent after still not being awarded any after completion of the third mission in the story meaning that in order to progress your tech, hours of play time is required to unlock even just mostly mid-range units.  The weakness of initial units isn't alleviated by the fact that you can make large numbers as the Command Point limit applies so you are restricted to small squads of units, not the massive armies you expect from an RTS game.  To go with the theme of a small number of units, the maps which battles are conducted on are best summed up as tiny, cramped arenas with very little room for manouvere meaning it's goodbye to any tactical thinking and hello to comabt which feels scripted and unintelligent.  As if the unit/map situation was not already bad enough, this steaming mass of disappointment is served up in a graphical style more akin to a comic book setting, gone is the sleek, futuristic, powerful look of C&C3, it is instead replaced by  out of place, chunky, Megablocks style units, which completly destroys any sort of serious mood the game intends to create.  The graphical style of C&C4's units is so far removed from C&C3's that they're not even in the same universe, nevermind the same page.3. The story.  It's fairly obvious that the story is terrible from pretty much the word go as one of the first scenes has you, as commander, greeted by your wife.  Yep, that's right, your wife because that's just what an RTS story needs, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t love interest forced into the game.  From then on the story goes rapidly downhill, not aided by the dire acting of all those involved (with the exception of Joe Kucan) and then ends with the equivalent of ""And they all rode off into the sunset and lived happily ever after.""  Seriously? After having fought now at this time 4 Tiberium Wars, having battled across the globe and faced all manner of foes whilst still wondering about the mystery of Nod and Kane and what the ultimate goal could be, it ends with ""Kane and all of Nod travel through the alien tower and leave GDI behind on a tiberium-free Earth having left them peacefully"".  I have to wonder what it is with EA and their amazing ability to consistently screw up epic storylines and disappoint faithful fans of a beloved genre because that ending is just utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and reeks of a rushed writing crew being forced to pull something out of their asses.So to conclude, C&C4 fails to deliver on all fronts: from dreadful mechanics and weak units, to poor acting and a storyline that could arugably have been concieved by a 5 year old, C&C4 smacks of poor quality, despiration and coporate greed.  A truly disappointing end to a great series, something that should not have come to pass.  I cannot urge you strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Oh and one last thing... EA please if you would kindly go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves bloody with a rusty sword that would be greatly appreiciated, you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",120,10,1,11,40,3,69

												this is the WORST C&C yet, a HUGE emberassment, the textures and graphics are like EA went back 7 years in graphics (seriously, compare these graphics on maximum to C&C3's graphics, C&C3 had best graphics of the series) you liked your regular Riflemen and Militants? TOO BAD! they're gone and replaced with robots with lasers, adding onto that EVERYTHING HAS LASERS you need internet connection JUST TO PLAY, liked making complete custom bases and liked making other bases around the map? NOPE you get a small circle, I could barely play 20 friggen minutes of the game W/A being utterly disgusted on how the Nod, the GDI, and the ENTIRE GAMEPLAY was BUTCHERED, and if your only buying it for the story etc, you may aswell watch the cutscenes on youtube.

EA has taken the game and twisted into something so horrible that words are incapable of ever describing the disust I feel.This isn't a C&C game. This is utter garbage and other words so foul that they don't even exist. There are no words that exist that can describe how utterly putrid this ""thing"" they call a game is. Do not buy this.

												I have been a fan of strategy games for a very long time.  Im a casual player and stick to single player vs ai and campaign themes games.  I was hugely impressed by C&C 3 and enjoyed the Red Alert Series and Generals.  Sadly C&C 4 is a terrible addition to the series.  It adds a confusing system of a mobile base with the ability to generate units on the fly but the system itself is flawed and the game play and visuals are poorly executed.  The campaign missions are confusing and later levels are extremely frustrating because the AI knows what units to utilize and what works while you are trying to get units to work.  Then you have vehicle units that have an ability that requires you to manually reload their weapon so instead of unleashing them and leaving them alone to focus on other events you need to babysit them to make them reload and its not like they have a large cash of ammo but like 30 or so rounds tops and can go through that almost instantly.  Do not get this unless you wish to suffer through the incompetent gameplay to finish the Tiberium storyline, because even i couldnt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You build a base, expand, create troops, etc...then strategically move to take out your opponents.If you love Command and Conquer, RTS games, or...games in general, I guess, then stay away from C&C4. It's not even a game, it's a joke. It's so far from the rest of the series, it's mind-boggling, and not only because it plays nothing like them, but because the other games are great and this one is practically unplayable.Do yourself a favor and avoid this game.

												Dont Buy. For God's sake do not waste your hard earned cash on this game. I kid you not, i started it up and thought it was going to be the sequel to the amazing C&C 3 Cains wrath, and i was blown away by how horribly wrong i was. This doesnt even classify as an RTS game in my opinion. This game is so wildly bad that it honestly looks like the Developers wanted to kill this series of C&C so they didnt have to make more of them. DO NOT BUY.

												I am a big fan of The command and conquer franchise.... usually.        This is THE WORST (so far) of all the C&C games I have ever played.        Firstly, the concept of a base was totally DUMPED. instead, you have ""crawlers"", which create units and can pack up and move around. this seems cool, but only the defense crawler can build defenses (obviously). the crawlers can be upgraded in skirmish and campaign, but you have to LEVEL UP for good units and crawler upgrades. nextly, rather than money, you use Points. (at level 20((the highest level)), you get 60 to use) Say, a nod venom, which is a TINY tier 1 hovering missile plane, takes 3 points. A nod Leviathan(HUGE) takes 20 points(you can have three of those and nothing else). See the problem now? another pain is that it needs internet 24/7, so if i go to ski, i cant play. Lastly, it gets very boring after a while. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. GET C&C GENERALS AND C&C GENERALS ZH (not available on steam. it kills me to say that ((HINT HINT STEAM)))Thanks for reading,sigmagames1			",10,2,2,3,8,0,7

												I would not insist on buying this game, with all due respect to EA. This game is nothing alike to C&C3 and is gravely disappointing. The entire layout of the game itself is different and suffers without the classic base-defense. I was hoping that the story would lift off after C&C3: Kane's Wrath, but it seemed to stray from the storyline itself. C&C3 is my top favorite C&C. I am happy that I bought this game for a real cheap ~4$ during this year's Summer sale. I would be furious if I wasted 20$ on this game. I would hope EA would develop a C&C5, but the ""fans"" insist that they don't even try and let the series die with dignity due to the horrid C&C4. If they are to make a new C&C, it would be like the classic and traditional C&C.			",66,3,0,4,5,0,7
