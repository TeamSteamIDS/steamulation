												The first time I saw this game, it was on a massive sale. I am someone who enjoys the naval part of games and figured what's $2?The first thing to take note of is the extremely low graphics. It is an Indie low budget game, so that does not actually take away from any quality of the game. It could have been a redeeming factor when everything else fell on its face, but no major concern. I booted up the game and looked for a quick tutorial option. There wasn't one. Even Rock of Ages has a tutorial, and that is a game that a tablet could play. This was built to be more complex, and it is. I figure that I have played enough games in my day to figure it out as I go through, I was let down again. It is not obvious what keys do what. It is also not obvious what condition your ships are in. I was let down yet again.In conclusion, this game lets you down at every single turn. Poor graphics, poor controls, poor UI, poor replay value. In short, do not buy this game, nor should you gift it because your friend will simply get frustrated and be mad at you.			",38,2,0,2,3,1,10
