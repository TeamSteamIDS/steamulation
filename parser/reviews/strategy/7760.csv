												In Memory of the Dujardin Brothers.On June 13, 1999, Squaddie Henri Dujardin, age 32, and Squaddie Bernard Dujardin, age 38, were killed in action during the defense of Berlin, Germany from the Alien menace. Many civilians became chryssalids within hours, and upon the arrival of X-Squad 3 the city was overrun. The Dujardin Brothers were the first out of the Skyranger and began their mission with fervor. Captian Leonid Torban, their comanding officer, was very fond of the two, ""Bernard could hit a muton from 15 tiles away and never miss! Henri, well, I guess he was good with grenades? He was the only one to not kill his own squadmates with explosives"". Soon, however, the two were separated from the rest of their squad due to a cyberdisk pinning them in a small building. Nearby chryssalids soon took advantage of the situation and attempted to swarm the isolated agents. The brothers made a final, valiant stand inside the house. Henri set up multiple explosive traps at the entrances to the building and Bernard provided covering fire from the second floor. It seemed the Dujardins would make it.The cyberdisk was destroyed by fellow X-COM agents in a flurry of missiles. As it exploded, it caused a breach in the walls of the Dujardin stronghold. A lone chryssalid was able to infiltrate the building undetected, and while Henri had his back turned, the chryssalid impregnated him. The transformation was swift. He became a shambling, grotesque mockery of his former self, his mind devoured by the chyrssalid's poison. Bernard witnessed his brother's demise in pure shock. Sensing this was his final turn, chose to make the ultimate sacrifice. He placed a number of high explosives inside the room he was barricaded in, and pressed the detonator. The only thing that remainded of the building was a single ruined wall. Bernard had managed to eliminate 5 chryssalids as well as his former, turned, brother. Unfortunately, there was no body to recover. Berlin was saved, but at a high cost. Hundreds of civilians lost, 5 agents lay dead, and one turned in to an alien. The victory was sour.Bernard was promoted to the rank of captian and Henri to sergent upon their team's return to their HQ somewhere in the apparently unimportant part of Europe.With the alien threat gone, Berlin began to rebuild. Destroyed structures needed to be cleared to make room for new construction. Only one very special ruin was spared. The wall. It was made into a memorial, the Dujardin Memorial. It lists all of those who lost their lives in the battle, with Henri's and Bernard's names at the top. A new warcry has been established by the agents of X-COM: Remember Berlin!10/10 would relive again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When people ask me: ""Mark, you like PC games, what's your favourite game?"" I respond with ""X-Com, with the - in it"" and they often get confused with the modern XCOM, but I further clarify with ""The one from 1993"". Which is normally the point where they pretend to look at their watch, make an excuse and walk out of the room.So why in 2015 is my favourite game still this? Well firstly, I'm going to outline what makes this game so special. And then to wrap it up, I'll tell you how you can enjoy it in the modern world. Because for me this game is still my personal favourite.X-Com puts you firmly on the back foot from the very start. Aliens have invaded and it's your job to mount Earth's final defense against the Alien foe before we are all killed or enslaved or something happens (the intention of the invasion isn't clear to begin with). What you spend most of the game doing, is trying to shoot down enemy UFO's with your rubbish fighter jets, and then trying to fight the Alien's at the UFO crash site with your poorly equipped troops.I use terms like ""rubbish"" and ""poorly equipped"" because you are fighting Aliens here. Not Germans, not Japanese, not another nation - but mother-♥♥♥♥ing ALIENS. These guys have better weapons than you, better vision than you and more resources than you. They flew across the galaxy to fight us, and the only thing you can do at the start of the game is fight them off with humanities best and brightest, which just isn't enough.This means that your troops will die. A lot. And it's mean, and it's unfair and the game is obviously hard because of that. But at great cost of life, humanity is able to claw it's way back and slowly put up more of a fair fight. As you recover Alien technology from your encounters, and spend time researching it, the X-Com scientists are then able to reverse engineer the technology into better equipment. This can be armour that can survive a few shots, or better weapons, or ground and air vehicles. Slowly but surely, humanity is able to avoid extinction.You are fighting for the very survival of the human race, and that's not meant to be easy. Fortunately the game equips you with the systems you need to be successful but it's on YOU to work out how to do it. This is a game where you might have to watch some tutorial videos on YouTube or read the manual[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com]. And if you do these things, you will be rewarded with one of the deepest and enjoyable single player experiences that you can have.So if you read this and you're willing to invest a bit of time to enjoy the game. After all, it is only £3! I recommend you use OpenXcom[openxcom.org] to play the game. You won't be able to launch the game through Steam, but it gives you much better performance on modern systems than playing the original game through DOSBox. The alternative is that you check out Xenonauts which is a faithful recreation of X-Com using an updated UI, better graphics and a bit more automation (such as not having to order ammunition and things). I know it sounds a bit odd, but Xenonauts is so faithful to X-Com that if you don't think you can cope with how dated this game is, I would encourage you to treat this as a review for Xenonauts. Other than very minor tweaks, and a change to air combat, they are essentially the same game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Also known as UFO Enemy Unknown. The original (1994) was super buggy and nearly unplayable on newer systems, but thanks to these guys (the people working on the openxcom project) the game is now playable and with lots of bug fixes.The game is pretty unbalanced and exploitable, here are a few tips: -  Don't exit the craft in the first turn as the aliens, that have visual on you, will have full AP and will likely reaction fire. -  Always have the maximum number of soldiers in the landing craft (while this might be obvious, I saw people that don't do this, usually the same kind of people that spend all the APs exploring instead of having some AP for reaction fire or retreat).  - Put the most expandable soldiers closer to the exit of the landing craft because the first ones out are the likeliest to get killed.  - Don't hurry, especially getting your troops out of the landing craft.  - Advance slowly, only extend yourself when you have an alien’s location and you can kill it because you don't want it to have a full turn while you are in sight. Expanding on this, try to kill all the aliens that you see in the same turn that you see them; that's why it's usually best to advance slowly (to have lots of APs) and have lots of soldiers (and implicitly firepower).  - You should use scouts (~rookies) that at the start of the turn will try to advance but also retreat at the end. This way you'll create a buffer and decrease the chance of enemies sneaking close enough to the rest of your (more valuable) soldiers.  - Exploit: After turn 20 the aliens are generally going to come and try to find you, useful for landed/crashed UFOs.  - A very good starting location is in west Lebanon so that you will have cover over Europe and a lot of the downed UFOs could be in North Africa where the desert maps are pretty smooth.  - The beginning (or better said the first half of the game) is going to be pretty brutal, use all the force that you can and don't shy away from explosives and leveling buildings even preemptively in some cases. Pros: great feeling, nice combination of tactical game, researching stuff and base building while under pressure to survive. Cons: exploitable, unbalanced, bad spotting/FOV mechanic, you see as much as the aliens only in full light which will lead to a lot of frustration. Rating: now, we are prodding *them*! Recommendation: only if you are into this kind of games and you can tolerate/like the graphics.http://pixelloot.com ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is freaking awesome, after 20 years it's still amazing.There are so many good things to say that is difficult to decide where to start ...- turn based strategic combat, take your time to decide your strategy- research based on alien captured technology, this keeps me motivated to keep playing- management of resources of your bases, full control of your assets- recruit soldiers and see them evolving ... and dying :)- if you are spending too much money, you could sell things and even fire people!- air combat is simple and effective- and every element is this game has an effect on other parts: A) resources captured in the battlefield will give you new research paths and money B) research will give you new stuff to build C) stuff you build will make you more powerful in the battlefield D) more battlefield missions will give you new resources As a Sci-fi aficionado this game will give you plenty of funny hours.Absolutely recommended, if you haven't played, do it now!!This game is a masterpiece!!

												I do own the new xcom enemy unkown and within, and i must say even though they are both really challenging and enjoyable, they don't compare to the original.X-COM: UFO Defense has an tense feeling, like everything could go wrong at any moment, something thats present in the new one but not as strong. I swear while doing missions, my hands shake, especially if i've grown attached to a character, who could die at any moment. The game gets difficult fast, any free time you have should be spent preparing for battle.Pros-tense music makes the missions scary-whenever you lose a soldier that you took the time to name, it hits you right in the feels-aliens arn't pushovers, they will mess you up-addicting, I always have to get my fix, that only the original can provideCons-I wish i could choose my starting base layout, i always have to move stuff around-black characters apear white on the battlefield, get hard to keep track of good people-can't undo actions on the battlefield, somehow this makes he game more tense-knee high walls make the worst cover, and you always have to walk around them leaving you open to alien fireObservations and tips-civilians are stupid as hell, and they always run into the aliens-alien in corn field = death-never stand next to a window, you will die -never pull the pin on a gernade unless you have enough action points to throw it -first soldier that steps off of the skyranger always dies, choose wisely-don't get rid of any weak soldiers, use them as meat sheilds for your better soldiers-DO NOT GROUP YOUR SOLDIERS TOGETHER, aliens have super gernades that will kill all of them-always have a few worthless soldier on your team to look for aliens, or take gun fireI would recommend this game to any person  who loves turn based, squad management games.

												""If aliens invaded the earth, how would we respond?""I think X-Com: UFO Defense answers that question perfectly.Launching its attack against players in 1994, X-COM: UFO Defense (UFO: Enemy Unknown to Europeans) has the player building bases across the globe, researching alien technology, and keeping the aliens from taking over/destroying the earth and making humans their slaves.Touted by many strategy fans as the best game ever, the game has a rather high difficulty, but the learning curve isn't that steep, thankfully. The aliens start sending more and more of their better troops the better you do, though.I'm not sure if they were going for a Nightmare Fuelish atmosphere or not, but they sure managed to get one, especially on the game's battlescape, with the only music being just a low, pulsing drone. It's especially creepy during the nighttime missions.If you're looking for a challenge, this game can certainly give you one, and yes, it IS fun. I feel confident you'll like the game, so I can recommend it in good conscience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Classic Turn-Based Strategy Game      Don't let the hours played fool you.  I bought this game back in 1995 for the Playstation 1.  It was cheap, and I didnt really know what it was.  Gave it a try, and it hooked me.  Im sure I have over 1000 hours into this game.  Several play throughs, alone, and with friends hotseat each controlling a base, and finally was able to crack the super-human difficulty setting.       Graphics are very dated, but the gameplay and challange is more than still there.  No hand holding here.  It really easy to go into a mission and have your whole crew wiped out really fast (Blaster Bomb).  Or once the aliens find your base, defend it or its gone.  Once you meet your first Chryssalid, Sectopod, or Ethereal, you will throw all your old strategies out the window and want to give up.      Buy it if turn-based strategy is your thing.  You won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												one of the greatest pc games ever made.originally released in march 94', looking back, it was amazingly ahead of it's time. it introduced isometric tactical turn-based combat over a full year before tactics ogre (the game credited with setting the console standard for modern tactical RPGs.)  then include resource & base management, reverse-engineering tech trees, and randomized events & environments...  it's STILL an amazing game, even by modern standards.*caution* this game came before in-game tutorials, and streamlined interfaces.  due to it's complexity, i recommend you read the manual and/or watch some gameplay explanations on youtube before attempting your first game. you have been warned.

 Originally posted on November 11, 2010 I've been occupied by XCOM for the past two weeks straight, and it's been a blast. XCOM: UFO Defense is simply one of the best games ever made.The gameplay is deep, addictive and atmospheric, and does a surprising amount for a game from 1994. Your task as leader of the newly formed project for the defense of earth from aliens is to stop alien raids and abductions by shooting down their ships, ambushing their landing parties, and destroying their bases. Eventually you are tasked with taking the fight to the aliens and defeating them altogether. There are two modes of gameplay, the Geoscape and the Battlescape.In the Geoscape (real time, variable time speeds), you build bases around the world, dispatch interceptors and dropships to deal with UFOs, do research, manufacture and purchase weapons and vehicles, and try to please all your sponsor nations so they don't reduce their funding. However, it quickly becomes apparent that both human technology and the funding from sponsor nations are both completely inadequate for the task. In order to survive and stop the aliens, you need to capture alien technology, research it, and produce your own copies, and then sell the excess loot for mounds of money.The Battlescape on the other hand (turn based tactical, top down) allows you to control your squad of soldiers (who improve over time in surprisingly sophisticated ways) in attempts to stop the aliens. But don't think it will be easy. The Battlescape is an unforgiving world filled with aliens waiting to snipe at your men from distant cornfields and ambush you from around corners. The first several missions you play, it is likely that you will fail spectacularly. This is entirely intentional, and really contributes to the atmosphere of the game. You really feel like you are learning on the job, facing a totally unknown and technologically superior enemy who holds all the cards. A genuine feeling of satisfaction accompanies finally being able to defeat the aliens in a mission (albeit with heavy losses), or re-engineering your first bit of alien weapon tech. The lack of a tutorial actually helps the game in this way, as it is much deeper than it first appears, and it feels very authentic to learn the ropes of the game in this way.The graphics and sound are marvelously retro, and might take some getting used to for some of the less open-minded gamers out there, but I assure you the reward is worth it. Overall, this is a game that you MUST play if you call yourself a PC gamer at all. It joins a myriad of other gems from the 90's that modern gamers are continually ignorant of, though they inform modern developers every single day. There is no better indication of the current stagnation of game development than playing a game like XCOM and seeing how incredible it is. This game with an extreme facelift would be strategy GOTY.

You don't want any X-COM remake? You want good old stuff? This is what you should 	definitely do!1) Buy this on Steam2) Go to http://openxcom.org/about3) Install OpenXcom! (and maybe some community mods for fresh gameplay)4) Enjoy OLD XCOM OPTIMIZED for both new and old generation of players""The goal of the project is to bring back the tried and true feel of the original with none of the issues. All the same graphics, sound and gameplay with a brand new codebase written from scratch. This should give it:Fixability: Play the game natively without any need for emulators or fancy hacks, with none of the limitations and bugs that plagued the original. No more 80-item-limit, personnel limits, funding overflows, disconnected facilities, broken proximity grenades, floating soldiers, etc.Moddability: Tweak the game to your heart’s content. Sure the original was pretty good, but maybe you just think it could be that bit better. A nicer base layout, better laser weapons, maybe challenge yourself with a custom game mode, or just put in all the crazy stuff you’ve always wanted! None of it is hardcoded.Flexibility: Port the game to any platform you like, customize it to your liking, or use it to make your own far-fetched remakes. The code is fully documented and open-source so anyone can take a crack at it.Originally posted by your parents:It's 10/10 and you should try it!PS: Images that will make you say OMG what a good clickbait![openxcom.org] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Full disclosure 1:  yes, I played the game back when it first came out.   So one CAN accuse me of a nostalgia bomb.    But I am  not reviewing X-com UFO defense from my memory of playing it 15 or so years ago, I am reviewing based on recent play throughs.   And it still has all the charm that it had from the start.Full Disclosure 2:  I played the Vanilla steam version for a while, then noticed comments on something calld OpenXCom.   (easily found on the net).    It's a free, extensive overhaul with many mod choices built in.   Very easy to set up; you do need to have a vaniilla version (steam version works for me...no disc required, and it is pretty cheap).    Some of the many choices are PSI on/off; improved H. Lasers,  choices for setting up your first base rather than accepting the default, and so on.   Highly recommended.Ok, the actual review.    It is one of my favorite games of all time (not judging it in its release time frame, but CURRENTLY).      The graphics are last century, iti is true.   But the gameplay is +++++.     It is tough; there is a lot to figure out, and things never seem to happen in an orderly fashion.   Sometimes you just have to give up a mission;  sometimes you just have to give up a game.    The aliens like to win, LoL.   It's a lot of fun to grind through a mission successfully, but there are no guarantees.    One of my criteria for a top notch game is whether it provides not only fun, dangerous stuff to do throughout, but once in a while something unexpected happens that blows me away.   Like  when I found out if I through a grenade on a roof, that it could bounce, and if it bounced into an alley it would fall to the ground, and if there was  a hidden alien there you would hear a muffled explosion and then....the alien death cry  you hardly expected.    First time that happened I had to save and quit for a while...I was laughing too hard.If you like challenges, tactics, and turn-based games, this is a must try out.   Good luck, andI I hope you can stop those monsters! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ignore the low playtime, while using OpenXCom Steam doesn't log your hours. Speaking of:  GET OPENXCOM. It's a free, open source upgrade that you can use to fix a bunch of bugs and make the gameplay experience much smoother.That out of the way, X-Com has aged surprisingly well. Sure, it's a DOS game, so there's a certain degree of clunkiness to it that you can't quite shake, but the gameplay mechanics are all solid. This is a game that punishes mistakes harshly, but that also rewards a deep understanding of mechanics and effective tactics. If you've never played it before then you're going to have a rough start, but don't give up just because you get crushed a few times. Eventually you'll figure out how to keep your rookies alive long enough to deck them out with lasers and power suits. When you get that far and the alien invasion starts to pick up the pace, things get intense.And, for the time period, the art and music are decent. They're a little quaint by today's standards, but you may still find yourself humming along to the simple loops here.For $5 you can't go wrong. This is a serious gem and a permanent classic. It gets copied by other franchises all the time for good reason.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Man, what a tough game. The main thing that makes X-COM different than Enemy Unknown is that this does its best to be a full simulation. This entails a lot of things.Room's full of smoke? Don't run around in there too long, or he'll run out of energy and go unconscious. Guy with a live grenade in his hand took a plasma bolt to the face? No problem, just run over there, scoop it up, and lob it over yonder. Want more global UFO detection and interception ability? Build more bases, and struggle to keep them funded.This game's so hard, Beginner mode is damn tough. Half the fun in this game is learning from every time you lose, unless you're a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me and savescumm constantly. I still get a kick out of it anyways, especially when the skyranger drops you directly into a house (random map generators for combat encounters).PROTIP: Get OpenXCOM after you buy this game. AFAIK the Steam version doesn't use OpenXCOM, and OpenXCOM almost completely eliminates compatibility issues with modern systems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much the original strategy RPG.  While the game has aged, the features that made this one of the most solid titles of the 90s are just as present now as they were then.  Provided you ignore the frame rate drops during base invasions, I really have nothing bad to say about the game.  Definitely something to pick up if you like Retro titles or you're a little strapped for cash.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still one of the best squad based strategy games ever made, though I personally prefer it's semi-broken sequel Terror from the Deep. Take note, Firaxis. This game isn't as pretty or customizable as yours but has a functional strategic aspect, economic aspect, allows the construction of multiple bases, and in fact, has a functional enemy AI that isn't simply a RNG based reactive prescence but something actively trying to kill you on both the geoscape and battlescape from the moment you start playing. 10/10Would go through the Chryssalid flow chart experience again.

												X-Com:UFO Defense, also known as UFO: Enemy Unknown, is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. No list of the best games of all time is complete without it. (I have put many, many hours into it, just not through Steam).The 2012 remake is a very good game, but still doesn't quite do it justice.<Public Service Announcement>: Make sure that you PLAY IT WITH OPENXCOM.http://openxcom.org/git-builds/OpenXCom is a free rebuild of the game that utilizes original game assets (so you still need to actually own this game). It fixes a bunch of bugs, and improves various interface inadequacies. It's still the same game, just polished more.It also adds easy moddability, with some mods already added to the base installation but completely optional. So you can play completely vanilla, with an experience indistinguishable from the original game except for the absence of bugs - or you can play with a number of common sense improvements - or you can download mods that change and expand the game.</Public Service Announcement>Now, why is X-Com so awesome? It's got an enjoyable X-files-like atmosphere of investigating aliens. It's got difficult but rewarding tactical combat. It's one of the few games I know where ""emergent gameplay"" is not a meaningless phrase  - the way you can chain your low level actions into fantastic strategies. For some very simple examples, you can have one guy carry missiles and pass them on to another who carries the missile launcher, or have have one guy set the timer on a grenade, throw it to another, who throws it to another on the front line, who then throws it at an enemy... the 2012 game doesn't let you do that.It lets you name your characters and watch them grow in abilities, which causes you to become attached to them and invested in their survival and success. And yet the game can be very unforgiving, and anyone may die with a single bad decision or some bad luck, no matter how skilled and well armored.The research, base management, etc. are fairly simple but fun. And then defending your base against alien retaliations, and seeing the same layout but on the tactical combat screen, is quite satisfying. You've built your base too open and without enough choke points around the entrances to defend against a swarm of enemies? You're going to have a hard time...One of the best things about the game is how you're essentially fighting against a ""master race"", the Ethereals, who dominate all the other races they send against you with sheer mentalistic power. Their psionics sow terror and confusion among your troops, and are powerful enough to augment their atrophied bodies and let them be as fast, strong, and dangerous with weapons as their client races specifically bred for muscles or whatever. And then you can build a squad of soldiers who can beat the Ethereals at their own psionic game. Humanity, ♥♥♥♥ yeah!There are many other reasons, big and small, but I'd be here all night.What's not so great about this game? Very little any more, at least if you patch it. But historically:Bugs. The most notorious was the difficulty bug, which meant no matter what difficulty you chose, you were playing on the easiest. I'm not sure if Steam uses the patched version, but play with openxcom, and it won't be a problem.Interface woes. Again, use openxcom and most of it goes away, even though the game looks almost exactly the same.Balance woes: - Psionics are overwhelmingly powerful, which means that as soon as enemies start using them against you, you're in trouble, and as soon as you develop your own psionics, the game becomes easy even on the hardest difficulty level. You can send a few psionic soldiers to the supposedly super difficult final mission, and have them beat the final level on Turn 0 by chaining a certain ability... This is satisfying, in the ""nothing is allowed to be THIS AWESOME in modern games any more"" way. It does lower replayability, though, and I'd say the remake does psionics better - at least if you compare both games in their vanilla state. - money can be too easy on higher difficulties, because of all the enemy equipment you'll be selling. These issues can of course be fixed by playing the game via openxcom. For example there's an in-built ""line of sight psionics"" mod, which makes psionics a lot less abusable. There's also an option that makes enemy weapons explode when the enemy dies, like in the 2012 remake, which cuts down on profits from selling enemy gear.Still remaining weaknesses include dated graphics (for those misguided souls who care about that), and some interface clunkiness. The gaming industry did learn a thing or two since 1994, there's no way around that. Nevertheless, we're looking at a timeless classic that I still come back to from time to time and never fail to have fun.Edited To Add - Note to Warhammer 40k fans:If you enjoy this kind of a tactical game, look up Chaos Gate. It's largely X-Com in W40k universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in the day, a friend of mine had a Shareware copy for X-COM.  It only had one small mission, but I was hooked the first time I played it.  This game is the reason that I worked an entire summer to buy my first computer.  I told my parents it was ""for school"" but I knew better.  That summer job was dirty, hot, sweaty, and tiring while loading people's junk into trucks and warehouses.  I cleaned out attics, basements, and barns that hadn't been touched in ages, stunk like rot, and had dead things that used to be furry woodland creatures.  But it was all worth it.  By the end of the summer I had two grand to plunk down on a 486 DX2 50mhz with a 350 meg hard drive.  And I made sure it had at least 4MB of RAM in it, because a game like this deserved it.    So, yeah, this game is a definite thumbs up for me.  It had so many layers - RPG, Strategy, Research, Politics, Finance.  And you were responsible for all of it. Forget to load up that special ammunition you needed from storage?  Move on bud.  If your prized soldier bought it in a fight? Then it was too bad.  Put your team too close together and they get wiped out by a grenade?  Tough luck.  Sure, you could reset/reload but that was not the way the game was designed.  You could even get nasty with your tactics - load up a soldier with as many grenades as he/she could carry and run him/her right into the alien ship.  Most gamers have a game or two that they have such great memories of.  For me this is X-COM.  It is a little rough around the edges compared to today's games.  There are portions that are not ""convenient"" and some missions just go sideways even though you think you did everything right.  But it is still a solid turn-based experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is for the few who want extreme realism and control over everything. You have to buy every single cartridge of ammo or every single rocket yourself, then equip them to your troopers. You pretty much have to do everything yourself. Never forget to research new technologies, then construct the results. There is no tutorial, once you position and name your first base, you are entirely on your own. If you have never played it before I'd reccomend either Xenonauts, which is VERY similar but slightly mordenized or the new XCOM game, which is more simple and user-friendly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best tactical game you can buy. This title started the X-COM franchise which has had it's ups, downs, and it's long periods of absence - but it endures. Modded or not, UFO Defense excels at creating a narrative, stories that are told by the gameplay as well as information filled in by the player. You'll develop odd attachments to X-COM agents even though there is little-to-no detail given about them aside from which ridiculous haircut they have. Very difficult, but no in an unkind way like it's successor Terror from the Deep.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The time shown that I have spent playing this game in no way reflect the amount of hours the I have played this game in it's original three 1.44MB floppy disk format and the amount of floppies I had to replace when copying it from a friend when one of the disks failed. This game for me is one of the greatest games ever developed and the sequels and remake don't come close to this game. I have never experienced a greater sense of fear as I did landing at a scout ship crash site early on in the game, proceeding to the ufo with no resistence. My soldiers having no armor and the beginner rifles with laser weapons still under research then opening the door to the ufo and coming face to face with an Ethereal with a heavy plasma rifle...

												There are games that are good. There are games that make you addicted. Then there is XCOM...It's the end of the 20th century. In response to growing alien threat, few governments decide to fund and XCOM organisation, solely dedicated to neutralising forementioned threat. Player becomes Commander of the force. Game consists of two levels. On the Geoscape, you manage bases, research (come on, all this sweet loot left by deceased gray cabbage. I know you want it.), manufacture and more. Starting with single base (preferably western europe, you have radar coverage over whole Europe, part of Russia and Northen Afrcia), few soldiers and fighters equipped with conventional terrestial weapons. It is sufficient for the first few weeks, but after recovering UFOs and aliens, both dead and in custody, you will get better equipment: Laser weapons with unlimited ammo, powerful plasma-based armament, durable armors, UFO-looking fighters or even possibility to make your soldiers use their Psionical abilities against aliens. But to get this, you need to get some UFOs down. Send an Interceptor, and use his persuasive rockets to make aliens crash. Then, Tactical level starts. Before engaging remaining UFO personel, you have to equip them: only equipment on the Skyranger (XCOM troop transport) will be aviable. Then you investigate crash/landing site, eliminating survivors of the crash and savaging their technology (ones that havent been destroyed during firefights, that is). Honestly, these are emotions: when panicked rookie accidently kills enemy Muton (typical tank) that was hidden in the fog of war with a rocket launcher, ready to kill my whole squad. Taking your first Etheral alive (remembering these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can mind control♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you). The moment you have to choose wheather to lose your best soldier and have few remaining ones get back to Skyranger to escape, or risk all of them to finish the mission. Taking out your first allien base. Oh, yes, different mission types. Other than fighting with crashed/landed UFO crews there are few more battle types. In order to make XCOM look incompetent, aliens can launch a Terror mission on one of the cities. In these missions, your score is determined not only by your casualities compared to the aliens killed, but also civilians alive at the end of the mission. Not engaging in this type of mission makes it almost certain that nation will sign a secret pact with aliens and leave XCOM project. On the other hand, when you encounter 10 chyssalids on the terror mission (community hated, extremly dangerous terror unit), that country can go **** itself. Having a base close to the battlefield makes everything a bit easier. Therefore, it sould be no suprise that aliens will try to build bases on the earth. For you it's a pretty nice target: tremendous amount of artifacts can be salvaged, as long as you manage to neutralise the crew. To make it all a bit more balanced, you might find that one of your bases (you should have few of them, to have world covered by radars) will have visitors from outer space. Just saying. Last mission type is obviously visit on the Red Globe, where you put end to alien invasion. IF you won't get destroyed by the time you are ready.Research and Manufacturing are important parts of the game, though simple: Labs discover and invent things, and engineers make them. Amount of the research topics is also worth mentioning, since there are no fewer than 60 topics, most of them giving new items, few of them giving you UFOpaedia entries, and few ones required to go to Mars.Overally, i find it quite sad, that this game is much more complex than many modern games. If you manage to get through ancient graphics and interface, a bit challenging controlls and few other tiny problems, you get very good and addictive strategy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												X-COM UFO Defense. To clear up some easy confusing this about the original X-COM, not X-COM Enemy Unknown that for some bizarre reason is marketed as UFO Defense in the USA.UFO Defense was a bona fide classic even back when it was released. You play the role as the supreme commander of earth or some such and must build bases, train troops and research technology as you try to stem the tide of invading aliens. Most of the management aspects take place in a pseudo real-time interface where you look down on the Earth and pick where to build what, which soldiers to send where and so forth. Once you've shot down a UFO or simple found one that's already landed however the game switches down to a Turn-Based tactical map where you must find and eliminate every alien you see. Different elevations, as well as the ability to remove cover and peak into buildings by using explosives keep the game challenging.As you progress through the game a bit of storyline unfolds as the aliens ramp up their invasion of earth and you are through a series of events lead towards the opportunity to stop it once and for all.UFO Defense is a classic game that should be played by any fans of strategic/tactical games. It might not have held very well with age but it's still one of the best games in it's genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You don't need that month of your life.  Or sleep.  Or food.  You need XCOM, and the deep satisfaction of creating a chain reaction of Cyberdisk detonations.This game has earned its legendary status.  It's not the graphics or the research or even the plasma weaponry.  It's the gameplay mechanics, which seem to me to likely have their roots in strategy games one might play with dice and miniatures.  You have to choose what kind of attack you make, what direction, and when.  You have to choose which item to research, what to build, and most importantly, try to predict your enemy's actions before there's a grenade in the middle of your squad.  I love this game, even if a single combat can keep you invested from dusk till dawn.			",24,1,0,7,2,0,14

												For me, it's the game of games, the best one among those 500+ in my library and 1000+ I've ever experienced on any platform, not to mention thousands and thousands of hours in my life I've spent on gaming.My reasons for this choice are, in order of importance:1) it's a turn-based strategy, so I can think or drink as much tea as I wish between turns,2) it's very role-play friendly, since invasion is happening in our times, on real planet Earth, within lots of real countries, you can place your bases anywhere, and you can name every soldier as you want,3) it has an enormous amount of various quality content — graphics (art for technologies and interface, the interface itself, gameplay graphics), texts (the whole story and technologies' descriptions), gameplay items (loads of light, automatic, heavy weapons, clips, explosives, equipment), sounds (both interface and gameplay), music (simple but atmospheric),4) it's incredibly simple to play even if you have no user manual or have little to no knowledge of English (the only issue would be to progress with the story, but even then you may play tactical battles infinitely and enjoy them),5) it's random enough to have high replay value, but rather consistent to be played with many different tactics,6) it's sci-fi (and I'm tired as hell of elves, orcs, zombies, World War II, and alternative history),7) thanks to OpenXcom project, in our days the game is fully cleared of all bugs, and the interface has all necessary enhancements since the latest patch from the long-gone MicroProse,8) again owing to OpenXcom project, the game is fully moddable and has outstanding total conversions like XPiratez — you should eventually check it out if you have another spare lifetime.This is my favorite for almost 20 years, and will remain the same till the very end, whether good or bad it is for the industry.

It takes time to get used to it.Other than that - it is the best must-play turn-based strategy, in my opinion.Like in new XCOM, there are two parts - turn-based combat and economical simulator on global map. In the global part you set up the base (up to 6), build all kind of facilities, in order to research, copy, manufacter and then sell alien technology-based staff, thus making yourself financially self-sufficient. Build lots of storage rooms and collect prescious ellerium. Lots of ellerium. Also, there you hire soldiers, screen off weak, and manualy customize the strong ones. Make up capable squad.You have a lot of freedom in the global part to make a separate game from it , however the real kicker of the game is the squad combat part. If you are new to a game aliens will often beat you up on easy difficulty. And it hurts. After 100 h X-COM becomes something like chess. You start using exploits like it was designed to do so. There you can master superhuman difficulty. After 200h of playing and reading a lot of material from X-COM wiki you can easily kick chrissalid terror mission's butt during the night on superhuman using only conventional weapons. And even then, when you feel super confident, sometimes, soldiers, you became so attached to, you trained so well, all die, due to grenade relay malfunctioning. In one big kaboom. Well... when humankind is on stake, no person is irreplaceable and the fight continues. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though replayability still nets the same result, it is as good of a game today, as it was when it was released. In fact, with the OpenXcom project it is even better. If there was more scenerios, objectives, endings, play options, etc. I would probably play this game every day, but there is only one ending, one objective, one way to play.Still a great game with memorable music and sound effects.

												I'm 46. I've played Xcom EU/EW for awhile But i'm getting my ♥♥♥♥ kicked all the time. Seems i'm not that good at playing them.So the other day and with all the hype around Xcom 2 getting my attension I bought X-COM: UFO Defense AKA XCOM: Enemy Unknown (1994) as I had £1.20 on my account, The Game was only 74p.Best 74p I've ever spent. Downloaded OpenXcom as it better than DosBox, More Option etc. Well ♥♥♥♥ Me this game is Sadistic but a hell of a lot fun.First time I've had to the read the manual for a game in a long time and it's 134 pages long in English only. Not like the modern day manual 10 pages in 10 different laguages. This game is worth every penny 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For this game, it's almost mandatory to install http://openxcom.org, as it will provide you with higher resolution options and fix countless bugs.I was quickly introduced to a violent world. Our Earth was invaded by alien aggressors and it was up to me to save our species. Every nation sent their best, hoping to stop this interstellar threat.The feeling of control and power are tangible and feel awesome. The investor's mechanic at the closing of each month add another layer of tension that was appreciated. Tutorials are non-existent, but if you patiently preserve, you’ll be rewarded with a solid strategy game packed with more options than any of the most recent entries in the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My Score for this GEM is 11/10.ATM, it's free @ HumbleBundle. Grab it!If you are a strategy games fan but are too young to have seen this game, please get it and play it on DOS box (to make scrolling slower). Resist your urge to quit when you see the pixelated DOS graphics.One of the best strategy games ever, with many sequels and successors and hardly any of them reaching the greatness of the original. Of the modern offerings, maybe X-Com Enemy Unknown and Xenonauts come somewhat close. Still, the complexity and ""realism"" of the original is amazing. Fire rockets which put grass and trees on fire, which then spreads, creates smoke and illuminates environment at night. And smoke blocks vision and can gradually make soldiers unconscious. Complex line of sight calculations in 3D when a soldier uses a flying suit in a partially destroyed multi-stock UFO. Fully destructible terrain and loot. Motion sensor grenades and guided rockets. Hardly any of these things where decently implemented anywhere else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, my original version of this review was terribad so I've decided to redo it to do this game justice. First and foremost, this is one of the best games ever made. It has been over 20 years since this game was originally released and it is still every bit as good now as it was back then. Not even Enemy Unknown (Expect a lot of comparisons by the way) can quite match up to how enthralling this game is.   So let's get some problems out of the way first; As much as I wish XCOM: Enemy Unknown would let you have more than a maximum of 6 soldiers in a mission at once, this game goes completely ♥♥♥♥ing overboard with it. At first it's not too bad, letting you initially field 14 soldiers a mission at once. It gives you a generous amount of troops without it being too unwieldy. However late game once you get the final transport you can field 26 soldiers a mission. This not only makes soldiers feel a little too expendable (Which can lead to some pretty hilarious things to happen when your higher ranking officers are in trouble) it also makes some battles incredibly laborious especially when you're unloading your troops from the transport. Then there is the user interface which will be completely baffling for new players. Seriously, it can take a while to actually get used to it. If you can get past it, though, then I guarantee you will fall in love with this game.   Okay now that that is out of the way; The actual strategic battles that take place are perfect. Fully destructable environments combined with every weapon being able to freely target any tile adds countless strategic value and can make or break any situation. Then there is the time units system. As great as the two move system in Enemy Unknown is, it doesn't exactly work as well as the time unit system in UFO Defense. Let me explain: Time units act as a kind of currency given to each unit on the field in order to perform any action be it moving, crouching, shooting, or looting. Oh yeah, that's another thing that's better about this game, you can loot dead enemies as well as fallen XCOM soldiers. This is a really good feature that allows you to have tiny victories by letting you take some alien artifacts or carcasses even when the aliens have almost completely annihilated your forces. Then there is also the game's night missions. Unlike in Enemy Unknown, depending on where the battlefield is taking place, night missions can be legitimately creepy and frustratingly difficult early game. It helps to build this really tense atmosphere that even in late game still retains a little bit of its magic, and it's only amplified if there's a chryssalid lurking around.   Okay now let's move on to the Geoscape... well there is a lot more micro management in this part than both the Battlescape and Enemy Uknown combined. I personally like it; it makes me feel more like I'm running a military base with all the little things that ultimately don't add much value to the overall game, but are pretty nice to have anyway. However I will always always ALWAYS prefer this Geoscape over Enemy Unknown's Geoscape. Why? Because this Geoscape actually let's you be proactive by letting you patrol your interceptors over areas that seem to have a lot of UFO activity instead of that god awful satelite mechanic in Enemy Unkown (which I will explain in more detail why it is bad in my review of Enemy Unknown once I finish the game.) The interceptor battles themselves don't have much more depth in this game, but they go by so fast it's not a glaring issue. Also, deploying your troops to deal with aliens doesn't run as much of a risk of losing a country's support as it does in Enemy Unknown, and as a result makes the aftermath of the council report much less annoying.   There are some things that I haven't addressed about this game in this review, but it's already long enough and I feel I've covered all the important stuff... Even if this turned into an old XCOM vs new XCOM, but after playing both games a lot it's really hard for me not to compare them. It's still amazing how well this game has aged over a couple decades as opposed to others, and I still stand by what I said in the first paragraph that XCOM: UFO Defense is one of the greatest games of all time.10/10 (Because I can't refrain myself from giving games I review a score)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still one of the greatest games of all time.  Deep turn based tactics and an enthralling overworld strategy combined that have still never been outdown.  They pull as much character and feel out of the graphics and sound as humanly possible for the technology at the time; if you can forgive the graphics, the aethetic is amazing.  Can also check out the ""openXcom"" remake for what's essentially the same game with some fixes and slightly revamped UI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Super game! One of the true classics, and - according to me - one of the best games still in modern times!Note: A patch openxcom.org fixes pretty much all of the bad usability issues in the original game. This is probably a must-have if you are going to enjoy the game today.This game is super for people who likes strategy and management. Unlike the later series of X-Com (partly but mainly after Apocalypse (game #3)), the features of the game has been overly simplified to make the game suit a much wider audience. This game, however, is the real deal... superb for those who like a good challenge and the management involved.Pros:- Best inventory management ever, including later X-Com, and possibly most/all other games as well. - Excellent base management, economy management etc.- Quite realistic; maybe apart from that aliens are attacking the earth.- Decently good turn based fights.- Each soldier has unique stats- Units are ranked in far more stats than the later games (again, this game is a bit hard core, and may not fit everyone).- ""Missed shots"" may actually hit someone/something else! Just because you don't hit your main target does not mean that the shot is harmless; which the two latest x-com games need to learn from! Standing 5 units in a line is a really bad idea.Cons: - Psionics is far too powerful. I would prefer having line of sight to the enemy in order to use it. Once you've got a few good soldiers with psionics, the rest of the game is pretty much over - and with a little bad luck only, you can lose pretty much an entire squad if you lose a soldier in the ship on the first few turns.- No heavy armor option available from start - requires research.- Blaster launcher is perhaps a bit too imba as well.For example: If you need object X from a mission, if you've picked it up and successfully evaced the soldier, you've got the item later in the game as well; unlike many later games where you can't pick up stuff from the ground.If the mission is going south, you can load your soldiers with as much valuable items as possible prior to evac... in many other games, you cannot pick up bodies of enemies, carry extra weapons (carry 3-4 main-hand weapons, just for transportation) etc.Note: A patch openxcom.org fixes a lot of the bad usability issues, like that it was impossible to save equipment layout, set an order in which units start the missions etc. For all players (new and old), I highly recommend downloading this!

												Kiss your life goodbye. You're with X-COM now.X-COM UFO Defense is one of those few classic games that truly changed gaming forever. It's right up there with DOOM and Civilization as one of the greatest games of the nineties.It presents enormous value for money, since it will keep you glued to the screen for many months on end. Pick this one up and kiss your social life goodbye.X-COM is as complicated as you want it to be : if you want to study base defenses and statistics, fine. If you want to blow the crap of aliens, you can do that too. Either way, you're in for a whole lot of fun 'cause this is a BIG game. As in, it could conceivable take you many months to finish, depending on how much hours a day you play it.The isometric tiles and character sprites are another example of how the limited technology was exploited to its fullest. And the artwork looks genuinely cool and coherent.Play this game till the sun comes up and you will know: this is truly one of the greatest games of all time.Category Description User ScoreActing The quality of the actors' performances in the game (including voice acting). 4 out of 5AI How smart (or dumb) you perceive the game's artificial intelligence to be 4 out of 5Gameplay How well the game mechanics work (player controls, game action, interface, etc.) 4 out of 5Graphics The quality of the art, or the quality/speed of the drawing routines 3 out of 5Personal Slant How much you personally like the game, regardless of other attributes 4 out of 5Sound / Music The quality of the sound effects and/or music composition 3 out of 5Overall User Score Average 3.80 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its your easiest way into this game as the interface, while simple in practice can be overwhelming at first due to this being a DOS game.Well worth downloading Open X-Com to go with it if you want the best experience.Favourite moment: I didn't really know what to do with the rocket launcher.  I sat my muscular Russian woman heavy weapons expert out in the open.  An alien appeared from an unsecured shed and took a pot shot missing by miles.Tatyana replied by reaction firing a rocket straight back, blowing up the whole shed and two other unseen aliens within it.Most successful mission ever.

												Alright first off, I do admittedly have some serious nostalgia goggles for X-COM, I played the game as a kid.I have to say, it still holds up to the test of time, with some exceptions. You do need to know what you are doing at least somewhat or you will get stomped into the ground, and the UI isn't exactly modern.The DOSBOX version for sale here, however, is marred by terrible performance issues, and i'm going to repeat what other people have said, play this with the OpenXcom rebuild, as that optimizes for modern systems, and has a ton of mod options built in. It's well worth the effort.This game is notoriously difficult, especially for new players, so take your time, and as a tip for those who don't know, drop a smoke grenade on the base of the skyranger ramp.All in all, this game is a gem, and a classic.

												X-COM UFO DEFENSE is a classic. This game is a rough hybrid of RTS and TBS that really makes you have to claw your way through to see humanity's survival.  You play the role of a commander of the E[X]tra-Terrestrial COMbat unit. Your international organization pools the best soldiers, tech, and money the world over can give. However you find early on that it's not really enough on your own.I originally started playing this game back on the PSX in 1999 and have constantly come back to it, each time trying to get my ""foot in the door"". It's a hard game, but fairly so that makes you want to improve for the future. With it as cheap as it is there is no excuse not to get it.			",655,134,32,120,86,3,104

If you like your soldiers being killed by aliens, turned into zombies and when those zombies are killed, more aliens hatching out of them, then you'll love this game! To this day X-COM UFO Defense remains as the greatest strategy game of them all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Truly the best strategy game out there. If you're a die-hard fan of tactical turn based strategy that can be BRUTAL at times then you need this. Even if it may be 23 years old it will still hold up (probably not graphic-wise). But if you're one of those ♥♥♥♥♥ idiots that only care about graphics, then you would be wise to get the reboot/remakes.I have yet to play this game even more. I've only been playing for around 7 hours and I'm still enjoying and getting into it. Who knew defending the earth against aliens could be so much fun! :DGameplay wise, it is amazing. Tons of options and paths of play you can choose. Tip: If you are completely new to theX-com series then you WILL need to look up at guides as this game doesnt come with a tutorial. Even on Beginner difficulty you still will wanna prepare.9.1/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A classic strategy game with punishing difficulty. If you have some money leftover in your steam wallet buy this game and play it on a rainy day. Be prepared to get your a$$ kicked. Then ragequit and go play the most recent X-com games because those are good games too. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best examples of a well made game that exists! I remember playing it when it came out, now after returning to play it as a retro classic, I am amazed at how ""full"" the game still feels. Hands down a solid 10/10 score can be given to this game, it may not be the most ""up to date"" graphics but the game is older than most steam users i would guess. Dont miss out on giving this game a try, well layered with RTS/RPG/SIM, ramdom events, economy and lots of items. GET IT, its worth much more than the asking price.			",132,16,4,34,14,0,29

												This is the game that XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Xenonauts was/are trying to remake. That right off the bat should tell you that there's something special about this game if people are trying to recreate it ~20 years after it came out. That there's something here that people just can't let go of.Turns out it's the truth. The UI is extremely archaic, the graphics speak for themselves, and the game lacks many of those ""modern improvements"" like autosave and such. With that said, this game was vastly ahead of its time. And its still good despite its age. It's very similar to Enemy Unknown in many respects (aliens invade, shoot their UFO's down, stop terror attacks, eventually eliminate the alien leader, etc), but there's alot that didn't get to that game as well. Multiple bases, no class system, larger battles in general (the top level air transport allows you to bring something in the order of ~26 troops into a fight), assaults on your bases if you don't chase aliens away from them, and more. It's harder than EU, longer than EU (took me close to 50 hours to beat this opposed to 20-30 for EU), and in some ways is a larger game as well.It's still a great game, though some might be turned off by how it looks. But if you can give it a shot, you can very well find a game that, even if it is one of the oldest games on Steam, is still an excellent mix of fun, challenge, and replayability. Just watch out for the Chryssalids. They are much scarier in this game. o_o			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-X-COM: UFO Defense is a strategy game developed by MicroProse Software Inc. in 1993, at the time the game was revolutionary, and is commonly cited as one of the first strategy games many people played, the game is extremely difficult, especially if you've never played it before or any other X-COM games. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  I would love to give more details about the story... but, I haven't progressed very far into the game, so all that I can say regarding the story, is probably what you already know; ""X-COM is a project that is supported by various nations to defend the Earth from Alien Invasion"".You will have a great degree of control over the location your base will be constructed, buildings inside your base, troops, scientists, engineers, aircraft, and weapons for your troops or aircraft. Being a strategy game lover, the only way I can describe the detail put into this game from the 90's is ""beautiful"". ...I just wish I was better at playing it. Game Play: As I eluded too earlier in my review, there's a lot of customization available in the game, generally starting out most people have the same strategy, and if you intend to pick up this game, I highly recommend checking out guides online, or steam guides. You will most likely need them.It should be noted that the fan base for X-COM have put out updates for the game, I never took the time to look into any of them, but they supposedly make the game much easier to play. I just decided I will work with what steam game me. (something with the DOS Box, updating DOS box, or downloading a whole new client, etc. If you want to know more, Google or go to X-COM: UFO Defense forums)For people in the unique situation where they HAVE played X-COM: Enemy Unknown, there are a remarkable similarities in game functions, and strategies. I was able to figure out most of the beginning Base, overview, scientists, and engineering controls and tasks, without needing to look up anything online......It was the battle phases that lost me, I spent 2+ hours of my time learning how much fun it was to get murdered by aliens, (mind you: I'm playing on easy difficulty, I thought I could take a few shots to the face... nope, just nope. Just one *zap* and you're toasted-carbon-molecules.) Achievements: Beating this game, or getting far into the game is an achievement. It's called ""being good at old/classic video games"" and I wish I was, I really do. But these games help remind me that even though I succeed in most video games and get achievements for jumping off cliffs and dying, that I really have achieved nothing. Regarding steam achievement... Nope,  nada, and that's just fine with me! Price:  X-COM: UFO Defense is $4.99, a package deal getting you five classic X-COM games goes for $14.99 (best deal, if you know you like these games). I personally bought this game from a Humblebundle. Conclusion: Here's the real question: ""Will you enjoy this game?"" and the answer is... probably not.But this is someone's childhood, just like Commander Keen is mine, therefore I cannot cast my vote to ""not recommended"", this game is really amazing that it was from 1993, and it started the ball rolling for an outstanding strategy game series that helped shape strategy games today.

												Finally, I beat the game. Long winded, fun strategy game that makes you feel like your always trying to keep your head above water. You will have the most fun if you accept your losses(not reloading a save to improve an outcome) and take your time. After losing bases and high ranking soldiers It will take a long time to recover, but with some research and skin of your teeth luck can overcome the obstacles the game sets for you. After a hundred and eleven hours I was ready for the game to be over, but along the way I gained many good memories of the epic, tense battles to look back on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahhh... i miss my old copy of this game...It's not for the faint of heart.Seriously, this game will ♥♥♥♥ you up, bro.In between the brain dead rookies who seem to only be able to hit their own guys, the Chrysalid who WILL raep every last one of your soldiers, and the secret pacts the UK is making with the aliens, you'll find that this game can easily catch you off guard with its difficulty. You'll constantly find yourself fighting a losing battle against the aliens, who are every bit better than you as you'd expect. If you're not prepared for what this game can throw at you, you will be rekt. Even if you are prepared, don't expect them to just hand that win over to you. you've got to play hard to win.Despite all this however, there is something amazing about this game. maybe it's how i can name all of my soldiers after my friends/enemies, and have a nice chuckle about the ridiculous circumstances that they died it. maybe it's the time i mind controlled on of them, giving them a taste of their own medicine, all the while having the most satisfied grin on my face. Maybe its that one time i actually brought down that Battleship.Whatever the reason, this game is very satisfying. the way it makes you work for your victory only makes it better. For once, you'll feel like you earned this win.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original X-Com is one of the best strategy games ever made. The constant balancing on the edge of ruin, slowly researching the unknown and making headway against a superior enemy, makes for one of the best gaming experiences you could ever have. If you want something a bit more modern, the new Firaxis Xcom games capture the feel with a modern twist, while Xenonauts is pretty much a slightly improved, HD version of this one.

												X-COM: UFO Defense is a fantastic game if you are the sort of person who likes turn-based combat mixed with basebuilding and management.The gameplay consists of managing your base on a world map, where UFOs show up at regular intervals. After you've scrambled some jets and nailed those suckers, a ""mission"" becomes available. The mission consists simply of sending out your forces to the crashsite where you have to eliminate survivors in turn-based combat.During the game your forces will become stronger and with the help of research, new and better equipment will be available for production. This will come in handy, seeing as the aliens also become stronger and more resillient as the game progress. I find that the difficulty curve is quite nice, up to a point when the most powerfull weapons become available, after that the game becomes a little trivial. Still, this does not happen untill late in the game, and that's more than a couple of hours of gameplay.The turnbased combat I find very entertaining. There is a load of different aliens with different abilities, all of whom are dedicated to kill your elite soldier squad. Some will make you moan in annoyance, as they take control of your soldiers, and others scream in terror as they charge forward and impregnate your soldiers turning them into ""zombies"". Atleast that's what I did when I first played this game as a very young little boy.The graphics and sound in the game is well, old, but many a great game survives purely on gameplay, and this is one of those games. The graphics are probably the games biggest weakness, but also one of it's charms I think. This is an old school game, for old school gamers, specificly for the type that likes turnbased combat with a mix of basebuilding. So take a trip down memory lane and give this little gem a chance - also make sure to get help on the boards on setting up the game...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Warning this game is Hard. This game is infuriating. This game can be rage-inducing  But man if this game isn't fun... This game is just another one of those games that comes right out of my childhood. I remember when the first laptops where open to sell to the public and the military had given a free laptop with training on their use (wow right?). My dad got a Compaq Presario, which I still have, This game was on there along with Colonization, Civilization 1-3, and Warcraft. However this game holds a special place in my heart, I was terrified of this game as a child and would  have thought of it as a horror game. But I digress, this game is what the latest game XCOM: Enemy Unknown is based on. This game is insanely hard even though the difficulty setting is a myth. Now mind you this game is old so graphics are not 2016 quality but, that being said this game still charming in a soul crushing way. You can set up every mission with 14 soldiers and you should expect a 50% mortality rate being a good mission resolution. Now on the plus side you can have multiple bases all over the world and set them up how you want. Research is slow and the aliens have a clear and painfuly humbling advantage to you even when you develop laser weapons which are one of the first research option. Which is a testament to its difficulty. Terror mission are the last thing you want to see on your map, and the best solution for the alien menace is to chase them down over the ocean and then shoot them down so as to hopefuly delay the inevitable beating you will recieve by the aliens long enough to get tech that it won't be a massacare. The only forgiving feature is that you don't loose council members and just a small portion of funding which can be suplimented by selling things you make.Inspite of its age with clunky controls and sometimes absurd difficulty I recomment this game. It is affordable and its sequal, X-COM: Terror From the Deep is even crazier than this game. If you are a glutton for punishment and want a challenge and enjoyed the updated version. I would highly recommend that you get this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I consider X-Com: UFO Defense to be the greatest PC Game ever made. Obviously that's just one man's opinion, but the fact is, no other game has captured the depth, the simultaneous feeling of slow strategy and panicked decisions, the infinite replayability, the enemy AI that has it's own agenda whether you're ready or not, forcing you to get your♥♥♥♥♥in gear as quickly as possible... If you haven't played this game, you owe it to yourself to buy and play it. $5 is about as good of a price as you can get for one of the best games ever.			",195,42,2,8,22,3,25

You will get mad. But you will keep coming back.

So x-com:ufo defense is a rpg strategy game where you command a group of soldiers and kill all the aliens in a area. You will also build a base and add hangers barracks etc to it (You can select where the base is located in the world). You must know that x-com is very old and very hard, aswell as beeing hard the game never explains what any buttons do to find that out you can either google it or find it out yourself. This game is a true gem and should definiatly be experienced and keep with it because it will take some time to get used to it.			",66,12,0,15,5,1,8

												After playing the new XCOM, I couldn't get enough so I ended up purchasing this game. One of the best decisions I've ever made. While the graphics are incredibly dated, but for being 20 years old (and counting) aren't bad at all. I highly recommend finding the Open Xcom mod after downloading, it updates the UI and makes the game playable by modern standards and fixes many, many bugs (and is the only way I play the game). The formula made familiar by the new game is if anything stronger and more sandbox-y as you get complete control over your base layout, your teams are 14 instead of 7 and there are a lot more events and pressures than the new one. It is also much harder, but as a result more rewarding when you beat it.The only real negative is the lack of a strong cover system (it's fine, but not the awesome system from Enemy Unknown).Score: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was one of the first games I ever played on the PC back in 1998 and a classic turned-base strategic shooter. You take your corps of men and hunt down and research all sorts of thing based on the alien life forms. As you research more into the alien alloys and alien artifacts, your squad becomes tougher and stronger in their armor and weaponry. You develop new aircraft and armaments based on their technology and take the final battle all the way to Cydonia. A terrific classic that anyone on the PC should experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												X-Com is a game I have become very fond of long after it's time has passed.As a squad tactics turn-based strategy game, it's by no means for the faint-hearted, as overly-aggressive tactics are almost always promptly punished with the loss of one (or more) of your own units.  This is a game where being OCD can usually pay off.Featuring a massive tech tree for both the aircraft to shoot down UFOs, and for your ground forces to have better weapons and armor to defeat whatever aliens may actually make it to the ground, not to mention the amount of detail put into the game's research entries, the game has a sound amount of content.The actual combat is solid, featuring mostly destructable terrain, and a lot of gratification for successful operations, and plenty of chaos for a turn-based game.  It's detailed enough for a strategy-game fan to get immersed in, if he/she so wished.All in all, it's an often-overlooked gem that I believe everyone should play at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a old game but is one of the good ones. You start with normal ordinary weapon and armor and men but when you get in to the depths of the game its intense. In my opinion its better than the Xcom: Enemy Unknown game. The only thing I disliked would be that some the death screams are disturbing. It is about 20 years old and still has a price in the store so steam must think its cool too.This game really good but if you can have the patience It'll be awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is challenging, even in the first difficulty setting for beginners. Graphics are alright, considering it came out in 1993. Sound effects are generic, and the soundtrack is okay, to say the least.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I gotta say, I have XCOM enemy unknown, with all of its DLC, and I bought XCOM 2 with all of its DLC, the same day that I bought this in the complete pack. This is the one that I'm addicted to. I've never played it growing up, so I'm not nostalgic over it or anything, but I'm honestly more addicted to this game, than the new XCOM 2. That says a lot. I feel like it's almost infinitely more in depth, but in a somewhat simplistic way, compared to the new two XCOM games, and that's why these older ones will always stand the test of time. They're just great. The new ones are great too, so don't hesitate to check them out either. The only problem with these older games is that they run off of DOS BOX, which means that they save to your computer, rather than the steam cloud. I have a desktop, and a laptop, and I play games on both, and I have to play two seperate campaigns, because the saves don't carry over. It's totally ok though, I'm more than happy, and can't complain. Check this game out, it's a classic!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even with Firaxis' recent additions, XCOM and XCOM 2, this still remains the Best X-COM game to date. Better than X-COM in a fish tank (Terror from the Deep) and the very different, creative and awesome Apocalypse as well as the fantastic modern re-imaginings... this is the original X-COM ... baby!

												I have enjoyed this game since it came out in 1993. I believe it still stands the test of time. Graphics are great for a mid 90's game. I haven't played any turned based strategy game that comes close to this game and its sequel (Terror from the Deep). The game can be brutally difficult and frustrating. But it provides a truly satisfying experience when the proper management of resources and implementation of careful strategies combine to achieve victory.A real classic.

												[Edit] - OpenXcom is not a game, it's only a mod. Keep in mind, that I am wrong in the review below!6.8 megabytes of fun.It's pretty ruthless for beginners of the series, since you don't have a clue what to do, how to do anything (all the buttons in the fighting mode for example, no descritpion at all) and when to do something. When to buy another base, hangar and so on. This is my first X-COM game I have played in my whole life and it is a lot of fun. But to be honest? I would rather play the new XCOM game called ""Enemy Unknown"" if you are new to the series, since it features more modern visuals (duh) and is far easier to get into. X-COM: UFO DEFENSE though is not a watered down version is definetly more complex. You get to make more choices, but the downside of all that is its clunkyness. Those game mechanics are more than 20 years old, keep that in mind. I had no problems playing this game on Windows 10, so this is definetly not a worry you should have. My advice anyway: get OpenXcom. You get to play at higher resolutions and you are able to zoom out, which is pretty neat. The game was not meant to be played in 1080p on 27"", so OpenXcom is a neat ""alternative""...which is free of charge. So, before you buy - try OpenXcom first. It's more or less the same game, so you get to know if it's worth the 5 bucks for the original.			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

												Said to be the best strategy game of all time. Not an understatement exactly. It's not as needlessly complex as most turn based strategy games. It's not as hectic as realtime strategy and it's not as shallow as most indie strategy out today. This is a really well balanced strategy game with destructable environments, funding, research, base maintenence and manufacturing. Very entertaining game and well worth the price.Story - What's it all about?X-COM starts on January, 1999. You are in charge of X-COM, an extraterrestrial defense force, funded by almost all of the major countries from back in the 90ies. Russia, Brazil, China, USA, India, South Africa, Libya, Egypt and all of the major european countries like France, Germany, UK and not some others like any Nordic ones or Netherlands, Austria. Probably because these countries wouldn't or couldn't fund a project such as an extraterrestrial defense force. Regardless, you are now supposed to cover the 'entire globe'. Well not entire, you will only have to cover the ones that do fund you and since many countries actually doesn't fund you, you can safely let aliens land in their areas. But if you're like me, you will probably want to go ahead and cover as much territory as possible anyway.Gameplay - How does it play?You are in charge of everything. You put up your base, you intercept and shoot down all of the UFOs, you lead your tactical squads on mission, conduct research and manufacture weapons. This game is amazing in all you can do and research is vitally important to you as it leads your progress throughout the game (like research bloody should!). At the start of the game you know nothing about these aliens and even as a player that kinda frightens you because these aliens, already from the absolute start of the game, they utilize far more superior weapons than your own. As the game progresses, the aliens don't really, but if you're able to stay in the game for long enough and have spent some fair amount of money in scientists you will realize that you can reverse engineer the alien technology and even construct even more superior weapons than them: GENIUS!Criticism - But what isn't that great?Well for instance, the aliens start out vastly superior to your people in every respect. This is not bad in of itself but it makes some of the future things you can construct somewhat redundant. For instance; you can construct armor for your soldiers eventually, but it doesn't protect well as the aliens fire incredibly damaging salvos of plasma matter at them which basically melts the armor instantly. Without the armor your soldiers only have 1 hit point as far as you're concerned but even with the armor they barely raise that to 2 hit points. Also, when one of your people dies; you cannot recover their armor. Which means that you must make a 20000 dollar armor for every individual you want to protect.     My other criticism with the game is that many of the expenses doesn't make much sense. For instance; you never buy interception planes. No you RENT them! What the earth? And when they get shot down (not if), you don't even have to pay anything. I think they could just as well have sold the interceptors instead, but seeing as it is the very first plane for a very long time I can see why they decides to make the planes that way. The funny thing is that the rent of bloody 600'000 dollars and you have to pay every month! I know it's state of the art but holy cow man. USA's funding is barely 700'000 - 800'000 and they expect you to have a base there plus at least one interceptor to keep all of the aliens at bay!?     Of course I am nitpicking a little but that's what great with the game: It doesn't really have any flaws other than that. Sure the aliens are hard as balls to fight but that's the point of the game!Conclusion - So what rating do you propose?I propose a rating of 6 out of 6. This game is bloody amazing strategy game. It's almost as if it was made for me. The amount of content in it is huge for a DOS game of barely 6 MB and even by today's standards it's incredibly fun to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nothing holds a candle to the original XCOM.  Even if you have already played the original and have fond memories, do yourself a favor and get it again and check out the amazing OpenXcom community.  There are some amazing mods that improve AI, Movement, add weapons, add enemies, technology, maps, factions, alter difficulty, and improve balance.   There is even one mod (Piratez) that completely overhauls the original game and changes it into you leading a band of mutant space-babe Pirates on a mission to loot and pillage across the globe 600 years on an earth subjegated by aliens.  If you want the challenge of taking a crew of mutant-babes armed with flintlocks, cutlass, and chainsaws and pillaging spaceships with them.... then it is worth it.  There are even one or two Let's Plays on youtube that are worth checking out if you are hesitant.  I've been playing it for hours and I've only hit the tip of the iceburg on all the new content added into this mod.  Check this or other packs out if you feel like you've already mastered the amazing original!			",32,13,0,14,11,1,9

												Remember that show you watched as a kid about that super secret elite fighting force that protected the earth against an evil menace that wanted to destroy/take over the Earth? This is about those guys.You play as a paramilitary organization tasked with defending the Earth from an alien invasion. Of course, the bad news is that the aliens equipment is extreamly more advanced than what you can field in the beginning so its up to you to even the odds. Gameplay takes place in two screens, the Geocape which is where you manage your bases, conduct research, launch missions, and monitor alien activity across the globe.The second screen is the Battlescape. This is where you take the fight to the aliens.Gameplay here is turn based as you move your troops around the battlefield trying to kill aliens before they shoot your troops in the face with a plasma bolt.You will shake your fists in anger as your rookie trooper fails to shoot a sectoid that is right in front of him. You will morn the death of your favorite veteran soldier when they die heroically in the line of duty, you will smile with glee when you finish building a shiney new weapon that you reverse engineered from alien tech and prepare to use it against the alien menace, and you will shreik in terror when you experiance a snakeman terror mission for the first time.This game maybe old, but it is a must play for any fan of strategy games out there.(Recently, OpenXcom was released which adds a whole bunch of features (including mod support) and bug fixes that is a must have if you play this game. OpenXcom is a free download so feel free to get it after you buy this game.)			",80,3,0,6,12,0,23

												A classic game. If you are like me and enjoy classic and challenging games this game is for you.Difficult and overwhelming at first it rewards you for spending time to learn not just the aliens but also yourself and the gameplay mechanics. It is a masterpiece in suspense, gameplay control and exploration. Far less streamlined than the newest entry into the series and more challenging it also contains tons of flexibility from troop equipment to base building.Make sure you protect your base though. Otherwise the aliens might decide to raid you for once.			",245,34,0,47,14,4,31

Posted: June 12, 2015
												I have completed the game at super human difficulty short after initial release.X-COM is the father of all turn based, tactical squad combat games and still today far deeper than modern games of the kind, although few.Compared to the new release of X-COM which is the closest modern game available, UFO Defence is back on graphics, modern interface, tutorial and simplicity, but if you do not mind graphics and tutorial and like to venture deep into finding a complex game secrets in tactical squad combat and out of combat strategic decisions, UFO Defence is not a choice, it is your only choice.X-COM in terms if time and what you see is the exact opposite of total war games, the 'map' which is the entire planet runs in real time or faster if you choose, and when you take any action like bases management or entering combat time pauses. In combat you play in turns, all other actions out of combat like base management are simply interface choices at paused global time.Starting up, you have an underground base with some basic few equipment and personell. You job is to deal with alien threat on earth. To do that you need to intercept UFOs with you planes when you detect them so you crash them and then land and explore with your squad. Also you need to react to other alien activities already on ground like city attacks. At the end, you squad lands near the incident, kills alien opposition and accomplishes the goals. But kill the alien opposition is not exactly easy. The second part is about three main activities. Research on alien equipment, dead and alive aliens and theories will give you knowledge for better combat effectiveness, stronger bases and progress your investigation on aliens and to understand your enemy plan - the initial title was UFO Enemy uknown. The second is manufacturing, usually based on alien findings after researching. You can manufacture weapons, armor and gadgets for your combat squad, plane fighters and their weapons for stronger interceptions, better squad carrier crafts, base facilities and defences and other. The third thing is about your bases. You start with one but you can build 8 total.The magic about X-COM is that you can do anything that later X-COM or X-COM like games restrict and present them as new revolutionary gameplay elements. But for X-COM veterans those were just restrictions. You can have a fully custom squad, from 1 man show to 32 total soldiers, replacing 4 with a mechanical small tank if you like, or two or as many tanks as you like, soldiers equipped with whatever gear from a large variaty of existing and later researched and manufactured options. You can complete a mission with dozens of real different tactics. You can expand your bases any way you like. You can build a 'research' base, or a 'factory' base or an 'interception' base or a 'military' base as i call them. Or just all your bases can be all-around.As a matter of fact, any style you want to play is doable. And every choice has effect. A tank unit for example is definatetly stronger than a soldier at start but it does not gain any experience. Soldiers improve mostly after they kill aliens. On the other hand, if you have the transportation space you may get a tank with you to salvage the situation if all goes ill. Or just do not use tanks - i do not for example. They are not overpowered or anything, but i do not like them, i prefer soldiers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest games of all time.  The gameplay is classic and has aged well, even the dated graphics are servicable, and not without charm.  Turn-based tactical combat in varying settings against aliens is perfections as far as I am concerned.  The light RPG element of watching your soldiers develop over time and get better as by far the most satisfying element of the game.			",239,66,4,29,24,1,37

												Let me start off by saying:This was one of the greatest games of all time.Pretty hefty statement is it not?  Unfortunately, if you didn't grow up in the DOS era or played the game, you would find what I say difficult to believe.  However, believe when I tell you that if you can get past the dated graphics, turn based gameplay, and some minor compatibility issues.X-COM is one of the most rewarding and fun games to play and is an absolute MUST PLAY.Shoot down UFO's, capture alien technology, then research the technology so you can use it yourself and equip your squaddies with it.  The fun part is in turning your squad of rookies into elite Captain's and Commanders equipped with the latest and greatest weapons.  This is definitely one of those games you have to play with for a bit in order to really appreciate it's excellence.			",96,11,0,15,6,0,16

												I had never played this game before, I hadn't even heard of it.  The fact that this game is from 1993 is immediately apparent from the outdated graphics and UI. With no instructions, I failed my first mission. I promptly learned from my mistakes. The game is difficult, but fair, and even the glitches affect your enemies as well as you. The first levels are difficult if you have not read instructions, and it is only marginally easier after you know what to do. After a certain point, you feel like you aren't losing, but you never feel like you're winning. Not until the credits roll.The difficulty of the game makes it more rewarding than any recent games, despite what was expected from The lack of plot and the (really outdated) graphics. If you want to fix those problems, you can play X-COM: Enemy Unknown. It is an extremely simplified version that lacks most of the depth, but is still good when taken on its own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UFO - Enemy Unkown, the seminal classic turn based strategy game of the early 90's. If I had to sum up the game in 3 words I'd have to say brutal, rewarding and erm...old which brings me to my first point. Due to its age it definitely may not be everyones cup of tea. If you can see past the age related interface niggles there is a truly deep strategic experience to be had here.Truth be told I've had issues running this game for years and years but with a little reading I was always able to get it playable. There was absolutely zero tinkering needed with the Steam release, it runs in a completely acceptable state on my Win7 64 machine :)This game stole a year of my life and a year of my friends. While everybody was out enjoying the sun during the school holidays my friend and I were working on our vitamin D deficiency, huddled round a pc waging war on the Sectoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and their slithering minions.This is not an easy game. It can be absolutely rage inducing when the RNG gods mock you from above while your crack squad get minced during a terror attack. On the flip side, the feeling you get when you beat some of the things the game throws at you later in the game is intense. The suspense of what this brutal game will throw at you next is just perfect. I loved it 23 years ago and I still love it now, while some things have not aged well the basic mechanics of the game remain as beautiful today as they were back then.A true classic in every sense of the word			",262,60,23,26,29,2,49

												Still the best game of all time in my book.  Open X-Com is a must, so get it!  The new XCom made it clear that X-Com's future is a dumbed down and simplistic one (yes I played through it), so the original title is probably all we will ever get that scratches that itch.  Thankfully Open X-Com really rules.  I recommend checking out the Piratez mod for X-Com vets.  Really fantastic full overhaul!			",15,1,0,5,1,0,6

Old Timer, bringing back some MemoriesIt's a long time ago, when those games were programmed and sadly, some of the games didn't get the setting as well as the original back then.Even in modern times this game still has a lot to offer, it's a hard squad style round based strategy game, oh and don't worry, you will start to hate the game as much as any new games.The squadmembers are mostly nothing more than cannonfodder, and you have to keep in mind that there are several things that you have to keep in control.Pros:Not all DOS based games run perfectly even in DOS-Box with contemporary machines. This one offered during play not one crash.A classic game, which gives a lot about the old lore of the series. Of the old series, this is the best.Cons:If you are a player that wants to have every game in your library on par to the capabilities of your PC this game might not be for you, it's old and it shows.I actually had forgotten how anoying it was to see your squad decimated one by one... oh, and check your squad members... they might choke in weaponry and amunition.Recommended just for purpose of NostalgiaThe game is good, as always, and it will always be good - if you look at the remakes made recently, you see that the story still holds a lot of live juice inside. It still fascinates players today.This given, the game actually is a game people might not used to nowadays, it's hard even on easiest mode. The Aliens often have a lot of advantage against the player (comes as no surprise though). And yeah, the endscreen can be very bitter... especially when you lose.			",1554,811,52,244,215,11,265

												This is a really addicting and fun stragety game. if you have played the more recent xcom games this is what that is except about 5 times more complicated and hard. the premise of this game is that it is 1999 and UFOs have been spotted all around the world and it is up to you as the commander of X-COM to stop the aliens from killing all of humanity but it won't be easy.The things i like about the game is the two different types of gameplay, there is the geoscape which is basiclly base-management in which you can tell your engineers what to build and where to build it and to tell your scientists what to rescearch. Then there is the battlescape (the main part of the game) in which there are a few different types of missions: UFO landings, UFO crash sites, and then the dreaded terror missions (terror missions are when aliens invade a city and will kill any civilians they can see). Another thing i like about this game is the graphics because for its time this was a good looking game. Now it's time to talk about the negatives and one of the negatives is the aliens themselves. The aliens are a bad thing because for starters they can MOST of the time they can kill your soldiers in one shot and during night missions it seems like they can see you from half-way cross the map (there is one alien you will hate no matter what the case is) ! Another thing I don't like about this is that it becomes way to complicated later in the game. Also you will lose almost somewhere around a possible 25-50 soliders and whay is that? Well thats because this game is BRUTAL even on the easiest difficulty i still struggle to beat a mission without losing one soldier (you will need a metric ton of patience to play this game). The hud it's self if very impossible to understand unless you have watched someone play this or played it before. Also there are a few bugs here and thereOverall this is a great game dispite the few issues it has it's a awesome start to a equally awesome franchise and with it's price tag of about $5 it's worth it. (If you do get this i HIGHLY reccomend you download OPENXCOM. It fixes the games bugs and improves preformance on newer computers and it also improves the gameplay with certain options. Also my overall my playtime is about 10+ hours. Ignore my playtime it shows.) Score:8.7/10			",51,7,0,13,12,2,16

												Depending on your initial entrance to the PC gaming genre, you may not know about X-COM. Turn-based, squad-based and definitely a game that grips your by the seat of your pants. A game that, 17 years after release, continues to scare the crap out of me while giving me a deep and fulfilling strategy experience. They don't make games like this anymore - and for that reason you owe it to yourself to play X-COM. Especially if you missed it the first time around. X-COM promises to give you a couple dozen hours of alien killing, research trees, base building and soldier naming. You will, after all, be losing lots of noobs those first few missions...

Product received for free
												I know what the hours say, but they can't count all the years I used to play this game back in my shortly after high-school days (both PC and Sega CD).  I'll be honest, I hadn't even thought about this game since roughly those days.  Thanks to HB for this blast from the past.I see that a lot of folks picking this one up right now are mostly younger than this game is, and that's great.  The only sad part I see are all these people who try to detract from this masterpiece of 90's PC genius.  ""It's too hard.""  ""It looks dated.""  Those are the two biggest complaints I'm seeing from them...Is the game hard?  Damned straight it is, but not too much so.  It's got a huge learning curve, but it's nothing that a litle practice can't overcome.  Not to troll, but ""get gud"".  Seriously, though, it just takes some geting used to is all.  But, that's because it's not generally like other strategy games out there. As for whether or not it looks dated...  Well, that's a matter of opinion.  But even if it does, that's a good thing, because it still looks really awesome for the level of graphics tech at the time this game was produced.  Yes, some of the characters look cheesy with their huge Guile-esque flat tops, but at least the devs were forward thinking enough to include female soldiers as equals to the males.  So, hey all you SJW's, this game is PC friendly.All in all, if you can get it for free, definitely give it a try.  What have you got to lose, but some time?  If you can't get it for free, what's $5?  The game is well worth that and more.  Would recommend 100 times over.			",44,11,0,7,8,2,5

												great game!  this game may seem old and dated, but i still love it.  the the way in which you move tile by tile, eatting up units of envery and the revealing of the map as you move makes the game kind of a thriller.  you never know what is around each corner.  the discovery of alien tech/weapons is the serious reward to all your hardwork.  it makes you feel unstoppable when you manufacture your own alien rifles or discover psy-warfare.  it can be quite challenging, but you can always save/reload if u feel that upset.

												Honestly, this game can be as hard as nails for a newcomer like myself (this is my first time on X-COM) and no tutorial is provided. But if you find one or learn the ropes the hard way this is an amazing game of the mid '90s and even now I can say it's one of the best turn-based strategies I have played. So, go on, instead of buying that new X-COM game that will pamper you like modern sequels do, save some cash and play the originals first.The feeling of suspense is great. But as with any TBS game you must be patient. The last battle I was in lasted around two and a half hours. (Probably due to my lack of experience.)			",1373,541,52,154,145,18,198

Any of these Mods speeds the game up and patches near enough everything.X-COM UFO Defense is a type of game I don't normally play but holy ♥♥♥♥ is it fun when you get in to it. It is extremely rewarding when you win your first encounter or research new weapons and tech. and it's all topped with a beautiful hard as ♥♥♥♥ difficulty. I highly recommend this masterpiece of a game. Get it if you can't afford the new one...like me. And even then, you should probably still get this. 10/10			",278,30,2,25,16,1,27

												I know what the hours say, but they can't count all the years I used to play this game back in my shortly after high-school days (both PC and Sega CD).  I'll be honest, I hadn't even thought about this game since roughly those days.  Thanks to HB for this blast from the past.I see that a lot of folks picking this one up right now are mostly younger than this game is, and that's great.  The only sad part I see are all these people who try to detract from this masterpiece of 90's PC genius.  ""It's too hard.""  ""It looks dated.""  Those are the two biggest complaints I'm seeing from them...Is the game hard?  Damned straight it is, but not too much so.  It's got a huge learning curve, but it's nothing that a litle practice can't overcome.  Not to troll, but ""get gud"".  Seriously, though, it just takes some geting used to is all.  But, that's because it's not generally like other strategy games out there. As for whether or not it looks dated...  Well, that's a matter of opinion.  But even if it does, that's a good thing, because it still looks really awesome for the level of graphics tech at the time this game was produced.  Yes, some of the characters look cheesy with their huge Guile-esque flat tops, but at least the devs were forward thinking enough to include female soldiers as equals to the males.  So, hey all you SJW's, this game is PC friendly.All in all, if you can get it for free, definitely give it a try.  What have you got to lose, but some time?  If you can't get it for free, what's $5?  The game is well worth that and more.  Would recommend 100 times over.			",44,11,0,7,8,2,5

												X-COM: UFO Defense is an often revered classic in strategy cirlces, more so now than ever before following Firaxis' re-interpretation of the series in their Enemy Unknown 2012 release. Despite being nearly twenty years old, the 4X strategy aspects are as strong as ever. I appreciate how the interface and geoscape are presented to you with next to no hand-holding. The lack of any sort of tutorial or battle advice works effectively in immersing you in a reality where your enemy threats are truly alien and in every sense of the word too. Experimentation is key, with base building allowing for different types of manufacture and research that have plentiful bounties to offer. The X-COM unit itself can be treated as if a business of it's own which naturally has numerous benefits throughout the course of the game.Yet the actual combat itself is where UFO Defence shows it's true colours, irrespective of how prepared you really are. It doesn't matter what armour you have, what guns you carry or even how experienced your soldiers are: the struggle always remains the same. Your units will miss painfully obvious shots, be felled by a single stray bullet or, most embarassingly of all, panic at the mere sight of a lone alien mook. It is because of the haphazard nature of X-Com's combat that it can feel slow and monotnous, especially as level structures repeat themselves and saves are reloaded numerous times in order to better chances against otherwise unbeatable enemies. Some people love X-COM's combat but I'm most certainly not one of themEven so, UFO Defense was a major sign-post for the strategy genre because it took these crucial features in the combat and global contest and extended them into a larger experience. Not many games to this day match X-COM for it's scale and even fewer for it's initially brutal learning curve either. Most of you reading this have probably already made up your mind about the series and it's legacy either way, to those who haven't I would only recommend you try them simply to say you've done so. If nothing else, X-COM is capable of eating up weeks of spare-time when it engrosses the best of us and that genuinely is a good thing.			",1297,466,58,157,117,11,205

												Nearly 20 years ago, X-COM struck a formula that has yet to be significantly improved. A mixture of grand strategy, tech research, resource management, tactical combat and RPG elements interwoven into each other providing what is argueably the best strategy game to date. I simply can not recommend this game more highly.			",296,38,1,40,36,1,66

												Depending on your initial entrance to the PC gaming genre, you may not know about X-COM. Turn-based, squad-based and definitely a game that grips your by the seat of your pants. A game that, 17 years after release, continues to scare the crap out of me while giving me a deep and fulfilling strategy experience. They don't make games like this anymore - and for that reason you owe it to yourself to play X-COM. Especially if you missed it the first time around. X-COM promises to give you a couple dozen hours of alien killing, research trees, base building and soldier naming. You will, after all, be losing lots of noobs those first few missions...

												Honestly, this game can be as hard as nails for a newcomer like myself (this is my first time on X-COM) and no tutorial is provided. But if you find one or learn the ropes the hard way this is an amazing game of the mid '90s and even now I can say it's one of the best turn-based strategies I have played. So, go on, instead of buying that new X-COM game that will pamper you like modern sequels do, save some cash and play the originals first.The feeling of suspense is great. But as with any TBS game you must be patient. The last battle I was in lasted around two and a half hours. (Probably due to my lack of experience.)			",1373,541,52,154,145,18,198

												This game delivers a wide variety of depth from technology research, base-building, squad customization, and tense, turn-based tactical combat! It always feels like a personal loss when you create a veteran soldier, use him or her to fight battle after battle, and grow attached to that soldier as your hero, only for the game to suddenly annialate that soldier whether it is a cyberdisk explosion, being turned into a zombie by a Chryssalid, or simply a lucky shot from a basic Sectoid. This game also does not forgive you if you leave a soldier out in the open or in another vulnerable position.

												This game isn't too bad - I was expecting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, coz you know it's from 1993 and I've been spoiled by these modem good looking ones; but nooooooo! What I got was a true surprise! This[www.gamespot.com] actually sums up what I had in mind when I played it.....heh..but if you wanna read my review of it, then continue....Ok,so the story goes like this: Sometime in 1999, aliens have come and visit Earth and cause havoc on said planet. With all countries now putting aside their differences (or at least I think has happened because otherwise there should some sort of conflit in the middle east....with the taliban or some♥♥♥♥♥♥...hahah) have come totogether to help by funding you, the XCOM to deal with this alien threat. You, with said funds, will in return, help those countries defeat the aliens, less they sign a pact with them in which case they're doomed and you will get less(or no actually) funds from them....Gameplay-wise, it's a turned base which I like because that means I can *think* critically and not ♥♥♥♥ up a move.......but if you do ♥♥♥♥ up, there's no going back because there's no take back move button! Hahahaha YOu use your mouse cursor to point and click where you want your guys to move and or attack. You get limited amount of time units which if used up, you cannot make him move, attack or do any other action that uses up time units... There are other attributes, but I won't be getting into them - I'm trying to keep this review short... :P Graphics, ehh.....might look ugly, but once you get pass that, the gameplay is pretty fun; game uses DosBox to run of course as you can't run a DOS game on newer winows operating systems! Of course...I uuueeerrrrrhhhhh............mmmm......used a mod to make the game *less* difficult(coz I ain't no masochist as apparently this game's a true masochists' game!)......it's called OpenXcom and you can find more info here[openxcom.org] or even here[ufopaedia.org] - that place has quite a bit of USEFUL information you want to know before tackling the game..........oh and while we're on the subject, check this FAQ/strategy guide out from gamefaq[www.gamefaqs.com] by KChang - very informative if you have the time to read all of it.... And here are some more tips for beginners: 1....you can also look through the discussion board.........Sound - well doesn't sound too bad, even the music fits well! Nothing much else to be said here...Yeah, in conclusion, for me at least - running the game through the Open Xcom mod(you can install over the steam installation if you want and just rename openxcom.exe to dosbox.exe and tada, you can now have steam track your hours played and or steam overlay enabled whilst playing the modded version! I didn't do this so my 0.5hr playtime is actually false should be at least a few hrs or even several by now had I done this...oh well...) , made the game playable and I was able to enjoy it.....though there were times I had to cheat because I just couldn't be♥♥♥♥♥d waiting and wanted to power through the missions.....hahahahaaha :P That and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥are my rookies so♥♥♥♥♥♥ *Gets out the ship* instant death on first two, and rest of the crew I send out to kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ alien that shot down two of my men, completely missed! All and every single shot! One guy was like right up to the alien, like a square next to him and still missed his shots!!!! What the ♥♥♥♥ is this♥♥♥♥♥♥! Who the hell trained these rookies before being put forward to work for me...?! And don't get me started on those terrorists.........oh god...........yeah nah this is definitely a rage worthy game, along with SuperMeatBoy I've played and that Absconding game....But that's like for the first few or so missions....once your rookies gain a rank, or and level up attributes, they get better.......but still not as good as I want them to be though...................... I made a guy with all attributes set to 9999 and he's basically invincible - can take on a single mission by himself! hahahahahahahahahaaha.....that was fun for a good while.....Ahhh.......still need to get to the ending though....lol.....So yes anyways, I recommend because I found it fun after a while and no I wasn't feeling any pain whatsoever whilst having fun! :P====================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): Intel Core i7-4710HQ, 16GB RAM (1866MHz), Intel HD 4600(driver version 10.18.14.4294) Nvidia Geforce GTX 980M(driver version 378.78), LiteOn 128GB and Samsung 1TB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me preface this review by noting that I did not play this game properly until 2016.  I bought the game last year, played it for 2 minutes, was overwhelmed by the UI and lack of guidance, and so gave up.  A verifiable mistake!I highly recommend watching a tutorial video (there's several on youtube or wherever you get your videos from, I'm sure), to get you used to the UI and basic mechanics of the game.  It's worth it, trust me.  This is a game from 1993/4 which easilly holds up today; I'm only 7-8 hours in to playing the game and I feel a lot more coming.The music and sound effects give an eerie feel, which I'm unsure is a deliberate choice or a side-effect of the limitation of old DOS games in general.  It definitely feels like you're playing on a piece of history.Give it a real chance, modern video game player, and you will reap the rewards.			",104,6,5,13,9,0,12

												Every night I'm screamed to sleep by a memorial full of ghostly soldiers.I sleep like a baby.Came in off the Firaxis XCOM and loved it. It's such a different beast though, so no maintaining super teams till the end. Your soldiers are meat for the grinder, nothing more. The Heavy Plasmas I equip them with are worth more than their individual lives. Their ability to put bullets in the back of friendlies and go berzerk only reinforces this mindset.If you get this make sure you download Open XCOM and install it. It fixes bugs (Included with TFTD, which I also recommend), makes it more customizable (Selling off live aliens to be vivisected is surprisingly soothing) and way more accessible (Jesus ♥♥♥♥ why is there no way to change controls/options). Though it doesn't add to Steam time.			",340,54,1,43,25,1,31

												A classic!I first played this game in 1995. It´s as fun today as it was then. The strategic chess game of the battles is always enough to keep my mind busy. Simple rpg rules, turn based. Every soldier has time units, which deplete when they take actions. And stamina units. Leaving unused time units allows your soldiers to react in enemy turn. Then just kill all the aliens.Setting up my team every single time before battle can get tiresome though. And the soundtrack is bad, though at low volume it´s not a bother.But after that. Any game that can survive in my collection for allmost 20years and played on a regular base. I must give a 100% entertainment value. And the graphics are just about as good as many indie games today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game before tutorials, before tooltips, and before the developers cared about what percentage of players could beat any given scenario. When it lists difficultly not by degrees of easy or hard, but by levels of experience, it means it. Beginners should start on beginner and graduate to experienced when the title fits. The game start doesn't have any sort of introduction, you're just thrown into the action without an explanation or briefing. You're not well supplied or well funded at the beginning either and you'll need to justify your budget each month, just like a real government agency. I started my first game, lost, and I started over during the first in game month. To help the next person in those shoes, here's a few bits of advice I picked up while learning to play: Rookies are cheap, buy more rookies before you worry about things like tanks; aliens can see in the dark while your soldiers cannot and the entire storyline including the game endpoint (as well as a few very useful research projects) come about after capturing an alien or two alive, so electro-flares and stun rods are not useless; and finally, if you ever see a hunched-over, black, bipedal crab-like alien, get the hell out of there.

												This is an awesome game from yester-year. You may want to go look at some tutorials first, as the game doesn't actually explain what you're supposed to do at the start (this was back in the day, where you were supposed to read the manual before starting play). In short, build up humanity's defense against aliens and take them out in turn based, squad focused tactical combat. The graphics are of course dated now, but the game is still really fun AND HARD. You'll be killed a lot looking for the winning strategy.I'd also highly recommend the reboot, XCOM, Enemey Unknown. Avoid the old-school sequels like Terror from the Deep, they're just another skin on top of this game with a lot of bugs.			",87,13,1,28,12,0,22

Awesome soundtrack and sound effects. (for the time, but they are still great) They tie a lot of UFO legends into the game which helps make it more believable.  The difficulty is insane!  At the lower difficulties it is beatable, but very tough on the harder difficulties.  You have to be careful as death can lurk around any corner, you don't know where the aliens are hiding, and one wrong move is usually death. One of the best games of all time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm one of those old farts who rave about this game. As far as I'm concerned , it is the best strategy game every made. The AI isn't perfect. Aliens will do dumb things and get killed but they will also outflank and ambush you too. The graphics are pure 1980's. Nothing to write home about. The movement of your troops and the aliens is clunky.  The aliens don't look very scary on screen. But this is one of those games where you'll go ""Oh, *&^% are you kidding me? How did that happen?"" as an alien floater you can't even see sends a rocket into your Skyranger wiping out half your squad before you even move one of them out.  Or you've moved your favorite squaddie around a corner in a terror mission, only to see a Chrissalid about 10 feet away. You try to run, but a Chrissalid has 120 TU's to your measly 40 or so. You know you're toast when the aliens get their turn, even if you do a reaction shot, cause it takes more than one hit to usually kill a Chrissalid. But the Chrissalid doesn't kill you. He turns you in an alien zombie. Your own troops have to kill you. Isnt' that fun? Playing Ironman in this game is masochistic.  This game isn't for the click-happy, over-adrenalined (is that even a word?) 21st century gamer. It's slow and methodical and takes  a while to learn to play properly. If you are willing to do some reading, there is a lot of information online for this game,  Strategy guides, tips and tricks and many other documents.  But if you're looking for a game that will challenge those little grey cells, this is it. Not only do you control the tactical combat part ot the game, but you have ot determine what to research, when to do it, what kind of weapons your squad should use, which of your team you want to keep and nurture, and which you want to use as cannon fodder, as well as many other decisions.  The main game is all about micromanagement. And one wrong move. Waiting too long to research a tech or failing to shoot down a UFO coming to attack your base can mean the difference between winning and losing the Earth to the alien invasion. It's an awesome game and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to use their head, wants a good challenge and likes strategy and micromanagement. I highly advise playing this game a while before trying to tackle the sequel, Terror from the Deep. It's even harder than Xcom. Oh, and try to refrain from throwing your PC out the window after you lose a whole squad on a terror misison.			",11,22,0,20,36,0,26

												This game delivers a wide variety of depth from technology research, base-building, squad customization, and tense, turn-based tactical combat! It always feels like a personal loss when you create a veteran soldier, use him or her to fight battle after battle, and grow attached to that soldier as your hero, only for the game to suddenly annialate that soldier whether it is a cyberdisk explosion, being turned into a zombie by a Chryssalid, or simply a lucky shot from a basic Sectoid. This game also does not forgive you if you leave a soldier out in the open or in another vulnerable position. For anyone who likes a strategy challenge, I highly recommend this game as a classic to add to anyone's collection.			",29,1,0,4,2,0,18

												A classic!I first played this game in 1995. It´s as fun today as it was then. The strategic chess game of the battles is always enough to keep my mind busy. Simple rpg rules, turn based. Every soldier has time units, which deplete when they take actions. And stamina units. Leaving unused time units allows your soldiers to react in enemy turn. Then just kill all the aliens.Setting up my team every single time before battle can get tiresome though. And the soundtrack is bad, though at low volume it´s not a bother.But after that. Any game that can survive in my collection for allmost 20years and played on a regular base. I must give a 100% entertainment value. And the graphics are just about as good as many indie games today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an awesome game from yester-year. You may want to go look at some tutorials first, as the game doesn't actually explain what you're supposed to do at the start (this was back in the day, where you were supposed to read the manual before starting play). In short, build up humanity's defense against aliens and take them out in turn based, squad focused tactical combat. The graphics are of course dated now, but the game is still really fun AND HARD. You'll be killed a lot looking for the winning strategy.I'd also highly recommend the reboot, XCOM, Enemey Unknown. Avoid the old-school sequels like Terror from the Deep, they're just another skin on top of this game with a lot of bugs.			",87,13,1,28,12,0,22

												The original X-COM! There is a lot of great things to say about this game.  Love the research & development of alien technology,  that is very natural as they are derived from items you capture from the aliens.  The mood is right, very eerie music and settings. Awesome soundtrack and sound effects. (for the time, but they are still great) They tie a lot of UFO legends into the game which helps make it more believable.  The difficulty is insane!  At the lower difficulties it is beatable, but very tough on the harder difficulties.  You have to be careful as death can lurk around any corner, you don't know where the aliens are hiding, and one wrong move is usually death. One of the best games of all time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can look past the horribad 1994 graphic resolutions, there is a surprisingly deep sandbox strategy game here, with a level of detail that competes with modern strategy titles. You possess full control over your resources, finances, bases, soldiers, fighter jets, research projects, tatics, and strategies. You can rename your soldiers to your favorite hollywood marine squad, and give them any weapon, kit, and combat role you desire; but, don't get too attached: the firefights are gritty and deadly, and soldier turnover is quite high... Place bases anywhere on the world map, shoot down UFOs in real-time, and deploy a dropship full of marines to crashsites and alien sightings and command them in turn-based isometric 3D destructible enviornments. Capture aliens (dead or alive) and their technology, then use your scientists to coax their secrets so your engineers can duplicate their tech. Take the fight to the aliens' doorstep in a climatic final battle on Mars!			",116,23,0,18,15,0,34

												They really don't make games like they used to. X-Com UFO Defense is one of the most brilliant ideas for a game anyone has ever come up with: a combination of realistic squad tactics and a deep civ-like base management system. I've never experienced a tactical game quite as tense and scary as this one, even today. You never quite know just what will be down there when you search a UFO crash site or an Alien terror site. The way the game merges the research/development into the Alien battles is pure genius, you are never more than a couple minutes away from the next big thing you want to get. In the early 90s the PC thrived on games like X-Com in their startingly realistic and in depth simulations you couldn't get anywhere else. No PC fan could go wrong with this game.

												This game from 1994 is on my best game ever list. Defend the world from an alien invasion. Build and manage bases, shoot down UFO's and bring home alien artifacts for research, equip your soldiers with the newest researched alien tech to get the upper hand. This game is incredibly deep, even by todays standards and the new 2012 XCOM remake.This is a sandbox game and if you dont adapt, the aliens will run you over.			",240,47,3,28,31,0,46

												This is X-com.  The grandaddy of tactical turn based strategy games, and still an amazing experience to play.  If you're like me and you grew up playing, you know what X-Com is.  You'll be incredibly disappointed to note that the steam version is the European version and has differences from the NA version, most notably in the sound department.  I downloaded this, fired it up, and was immediately disappointed.  Killing sectoids especially feels much less satisfying with the euro sounds.It's still an incredible game and if you've never played it, you should.  It's a hardcore game, even in an era where most games were hardcore.   It's grueling, atmospheric, and intense, and quite a bit dated, but it's still a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												X-COM: UFO Defense is a hybrid of turn-based tactics and real-time management that is frankly astounding. This is easily one of the best strategy games of all time, and I'm not alone when I say that. Many recognize it as such. There's a slight wit to the game that makes it never too grim nor too silly. In addition, it's got downright brutal difficulty (leading to some of the best challenge around), a surprising amount of strategic depth, and it's immensely satisfying to win. Any strategy game fan *needs* to play this game. Period.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												XCOM is an excellent turn based game. If you like this type of game, seriously consider UFO Extraterretrials Gold. It is a little more modern, has more technology and you get to level up your soldiers. There is also UFO Trilogy, which is not on Steam, but is cheaply imported from the UK. All these games run fine in Win 7 64-bit. (Two of the Trilogy games do not like Intel graphics.)			",36,24,0,42,19,0,59

												This is probably the worst tower defense game ever made. The idea is apaprently that it is THE FUTURE (aka 5 years ago because this game was made in the Bronze Age) and aliens have started crashing to Earth in their UFOs. You're part of X-COM, the UFO Defense team, which has to protect them. Unfortunately there are two massive flaws. One, the enemies never show up, which is a bunch of crap but it doesn't even matter because the second massive flaw is that THE ALIENS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO PROTECT ATTACK YOU. Yeah, they basically broke the AI really badly. Your own soldiers barely even react without you telling them what to do which is pretty dumb. The game's grid-based like most tower defense games, but I never even got to set up any towers because my men were cut down by the stupid aliens. What a joke. You'd think a game made by the Ancient Romans would be patched by now.			",218,98,3,24,13,1,35

												The original, and the best. The recently released abomination from 2k (XCOM in name only) drove me to go back and revisit this series and it has never been more enjoyable Grab UFO Extender and the patches (google ""enemy unknown extended"" for instructions) and marvel at this incredible classic in full pixellated HD widescreen glory, with many improvements such as base construction queueing, range based distance, automated manufacturing (so you don't have to make/sell micro to make money), and dozens if not hundreds of other major improvements. The best part is that the innovations are totally customizable... edit UFOExtender.ini to your heart's content and give yourself the perfect muton slaughtering experience. If the rubbish cashgrab they released this year was half the game this is it would be 2012's Game of the Year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a manual link on the right of the game screen in your steam library. You should look it over that will help a lot. This is a great strategy game with lots of options. You can create your own style of game play. From building your bases to equiping troops. It is not easy to get started but that is what makes it a great strategy game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For $5 you can own this legendary classic. Tense on all levels, this game has you sending men into field after field hunting for aliens noone has ever seen. It uses real time as you hunt down UFOs to shoot down, but when you send your men down to recover wreckage, it turns into a highly stratigic, turn based game. With plenty of Technology, lore, and strategy, you will be sinking endless hours into this game. HOWEVER, this game takes ages to complete, maybe longer than anyone has to spare. Also, I had to look online to fix a lagging emulator. But after less than five minutes of searching, I had the game running. OVERALL for $5, why wouldn't you buy the game!?If you do pick it up, look for OpenXCom to improve your experience further.			",161,33,2,18,24,0,52

It's also fairly high up there in terms of gaming overall.If you want to be on the upper eschelon of living by competing against a large scale alien invasion and saving the your planet, and perhaps the galaxy, then this game is for you.

												The original, and the best. The recently released abomination from 2k (XCOM in name only) drove me to go back and revisit this series and it has never been more enjoyable. Grab UFO Extender and the patches (google ""enemy unknown extended"" for instructions) and marvel at this incredible classic in full pixellated HD widescreen glory, with many improvements such as base construction queueing, range based distance, automated manufacturing (so you don't have to make/sell micro to make money), and dozens if not hundreds of other major improvements. The best part is that the innovations are totally customizable... edit UFOExtender.ini to your heart's content and give yourself the perfect muton slaughtering experience. If the rubbish cashgrab they released this year was half the game this is it would be 2012's Game of the Year.			",272,92,5,38,26,5,35

												After Minecraft, X-COM UFOD is my favorite game of all time. In fact it may be no coincidence that both games share common traits: they both have stellar gameplay and horrible graphics. Most game developers today seem to have forgotten a simple truth- Gameplay > Graphics. XCOM gives you command of an army of super-soldiers to fight off an alien invasion. Micro-managing is the key to victory and boy....there is plenty of that. You decide everything from where your bases will be / how large or small to how many bullets each soldier carries. The combat is turn-based and the enemy AI , while not as good as later games , can still be very sneaky.What I enjoyed most is how your soldiers *slowly* ramp up in strength via reverse engineering of captured alien tech. There are times when ( if you havent been researching fast enough) you may encounter stronger aliens and still be useing simple guns! Defeating these stonger aliens with current weapons are the great story-making events of the XCOM game.Oh did I mention the RPG elements too? Each soldier in your army has his/ her own stats. These stats can determine things like what weapon they would be best at, if they would make a great scout, a good medic, or if they should be sent packing.Any fan of RPG + Turn-base + Sci Fi games simply cannot go wrong with this title. Rivscore- 99 / 100 ++NOTE++ Yes. That's right...99 out of 100. This game is almost perfect. If the Devs would pay for Scarlett Johanson to come to my next birthday party and blow...out my candles it would be 100 / 100.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First played it with my brother a long time ago. A very long time ago. So long we had it on one floppy disc. For a game that small, it delivered an agony of considering every move, horrifying experience of meeting the first cyberdick and then cryssa*#&^$(#ers. Back then (and i think it is still now) there was a bug that all difficulty levels played as the highest. And we thought the game was difficult on easy...The game starts with a handful of soldiers with pitiful guns, a meatshield against alien menace. Literally meat sometimes, where you step one tile too far in the night and get poked by a plasma pistol from the feckin Sectoid hiding in the wheat and you can't even see the basturd until you walk right next to him.Once you get laser weaponry the game becomes much easier. I never used plasma. Didn't see the reason to. Overwhelming laser firepower was my answer to all alien questions.I found the psionic aspect of the game to be least enjoyable of all:1. Aliens have an upper hand because they can cheat the fog of war and see you all the time so they can find the weakest link and mind-control him all the time. And, as it usually turns out, he's your commander top-level elite soldier you've been grooming for the last 50 hrs. 2. Once you get the magic powers, the game becomes trivial. Find an alien, mind-control him to reveal more aliens and snipe them from afar (accuracy is not affected by distance). Throw their own grenades at their feet. If they have a blaster launcher... well they will be scraping themselves off the geography soon.IMPORTANT: Get the openXcom mod for this game. It adds loads of features, and mods as well. My favourite is the one where your soldiers get combat ribbons and medals for their achievements on the battlefield.			",64,5,0,25,16,0,20

												The original. Some of the mechanics are a bit obtuse and it's definitely hard-mode, but the gameplay and mechanics still hold up to this day.That being said, there are certainly better versions out there now. XCOM is a lot more streamlined and beginner-friendly, so I would honestly recommend starting there if you're not a veteran of turn-based strategy games. This game will not hold your hand. If you've played XCOM but looking for more in-depth or deeper gameplay, then Xenonauts might be worth looking into. At this point, this game is only worth playing if you have nostalgia or want to see where it all started. If you're willing to put up with the dated graphics then there's still an amazing game here.			",407,135,7,87,67,5,88

												Every once in mankind's history, new technological advances in society boosts living conditions. Although, as life is more enjoyable, the better the entertainment is desired of the human race. One video game came along in history called ""X-COM:UFO(Enemy Unknown) that changed the percepetive of how turn-based tatics and the requirement of the human mind was needed to combat a very secretive but deadly extraterrestrial life that decided to visit planet Earth. You are responsible to combat these new enemies of the human race using a small tactical force of suicidal footsoldiers and badass Spartans. No matter which direction you choose to defend our ""finders keepers"" home planet, you will experience an intense, nerve racking experience that will be with you for the rest of your gaming career. Enjoy!ALSO! I highly recommend the ""OpenXcom"" mod to improve the UI and fix the bugs. Good Luck!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Struggled to run this beast game on my computer seeing the graphics and gameplay are of the next gen. This game would've been good at it's time and is probably one of the best rts games to this day. Although back then the games weren't as complex as they are know this game is good for you oldies who like to remincise the good old 3rd generation games. I myself am too young to be able to enjoy this game as it's too outdated compared to what i've played. Chrysalids can get op 5/10			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												I'll give credit where credit is due. The game has a lot of complexity and I have a lot of respect for it and its successors (go look at my hours in EU and XCOM 2).Having said that, this is a game back from the days where you got control manuals. The Steam version does not. It's like trying to learn how to pilot a goddam submarine that's about to explode.All my troops get about four steps off the unloading ramp before a Cyberdisk gibs them, leaving the derpy laderhosen clad civilians to their doom.  You can probably figure out with some crash courses on the internet, but frankly I just can't put that much effort into a game I spent 1.50$ on. If you grew up with this and know it, go back to it and love it the way it deserves. Otherwise, if you're like me, just stick to EU/XCOM2.			",71,7,0,9,1,0,13

												It was a great game at the time, however it is limited by its age. By today's standards, the UI is near impossible to use, controls can be fiddly, and missions can get quite boring searching for that last alien on the map. If you've played this game previously I would recommend picking it up for the nostalgia, but if you haven't played this game, you're going to have a very difficult time with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, I loved this game back when it came out, and still love it. Many have tried to clone this game and ""improve"" upon it, but there is just no beating the classic.So why am I not recommending it?If, like me, you played it and loved it, you have no need for my review, get it and have fun.If however you never played this game, it is hard getting into and the graphics may put you off. I am fully aware that part of me still loving the game is nostalgia, something you will not have as a new player. There are still things that annoy me in this game, like hunting for the final alien in a map, when they are off hiding somewhere. It can get so frustrating that I would send soldiers everywhere, hoping they get shot at just to reveal the enemy. The new XCOM reboot solved this by adding noises that your soldiers can hear to direct you to the enemy.Also, once you have the game figured out, you can get overpowering very easily, with endless amounts of money from producing and selling weapons, to supereasy levels where you can just mind control all the aliens and have them kill each other.

												X-COM is remembered by many old-school gamers as the uber-difficult, tactic-heavy, turn-based strategy game of earth's defense against aliens.While it is still all of these things, it is very difficult to play this game today when there exists the new X-COM games with modern day conveniences. If you've played this game before, it may still get a playthrough thanks to nostalgia. However, if you have never played this game before, it is doubtful that you will both understand how to play this game, nor find it worthwhile to actually play through it.While it may not really have stood the test of time to be playable to the masses, it is a title that will always be remembered by those who enjoyed it many years ago.4/10 ""Not worth playing today""			",97,38,1,24,4,3,12

												With nostalgia this game is probably great. I played it back then and even hex-edited it heavily to create modified game logic (upgraded ship weapons, single-supersoldier game mode etc.). The way it's designed is very motivating, and the fact that you start very weak is something you don't find in many games these days where it's all easing-in. It is so much more rewarding if you built everything on a difficult start.If you've not lived in that era of gaming though, you might want to skip this (and get the new game which was modeled after this original and thus understandably is massively popular), because the technical implementation seems crude. The DOSBox mode likes to resize program windows you might have open, and during my brief tests it rarely ever accepted mouse clicks on the globe nav buttons, and some menu sound effects were delayed.So I ran the windows version and it asks me for the executable every time and then automatically also launches some kind of fix-EXE. Whether I do this or run the EXE manually, the game only gives me a black screen. I hear intro music in the background, but no keys are accepted. I have to terminate the process.Too bad. I wanted to at least check whether the Windows version has better usability.Reviews say to install OpenXCOM, but I'm not motivated enough to do all that modding stuff these days.After all, I've played this game to death many years ago, hah.

												This game is a gem for its time, maybe even one of the best - yet most complex and demanding - pieces ever created on personal computer. Hopefully the presented claim is only little exaggeration. *UFO Defense* gameplay includes multiple aspects such as financial and supply management, base construction planning, research and manufacture organisation, big view world-defense with hypersonic jet planes and later innovative solutions; soldier recruitment and training, as well as turn-based tactical ground combat that the reviewed product pioneered in great extent. Recovery of alien artifacts and technology with their adaptation to Earth-based equipment is crucial to ones development in pursuit of defeating an enemy, whose abilities and ravagery increase with time.Memories of fine hours dedicated to exploring the world endangered by alien invasion - and its only shield, the international X-COM force - brought me back to this product. I am still under impression of its uniqueness. Nevertheless, for present day, this DosBox version - that STEAM claims to be Windows-compatible - is far from working acceptably. Five euro/dollars for a program older than twenty years is robbery considering the current standards. If you are going to buy *UFO Defense*, do it only for the sake of *OpenXcom* - a fan-made and well done upgrade that greatly enchances the playability of the game, next to optimizing it for modern systems. *OpenXcom* requires the original *UFO Defense* data. Know, yet, that this data are remote files that ought to be available for free already.Is this game difficult? Whether it is difficult or easy for someone who already knows how to play it, is one thing - but to learn how to play it on minimum required level, is other thing - and that may be tough; be warned. It is a nostalgia purchase nowadays. User-friendliness is hardly a feature here.I truly admire *UFO Defense*, as well as impressive input that the fandom had into making it so much better experience, therefore I need to be fair with what we get on STEAM at the moment [2016] for the price of five euro/dollars: thumbs down. DosBox version is out of play.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remeber, I used to play this game a long time ago and it wasn't so difficult..., it is impossible to win on easy level, I can't imagine to play on hard one. Well, it is wast of time and even it is just £3, because it is full of bugs, cheating rubbish. I remeber I finished X-COM years ago, I don't undersdtand, what is problem now. Another thing is, game crashed quite often, it is annoying to start mission again and again..., if steam wonna take money, perhaps should do some small effort to  make this little♥♥♥♥♥♥working properly.

												Stick with the newer titles.  This game is very slow, and initially interesting in the base management and UFO interception bits.  Once you get into combat, however, is where the game crashes and burns.  It runs at a miserable single-digits framerate, it's a pain to move the camera at all, and enemy aliens kill you in one shot on beginner mode, or knock your guys unconscious just by shooting the ground in front of them.  Took me 30 minutes of painfully slow walking to find an alien, and got completely wiped by said alien after he sniped half my team and mowed down the other half as I walked up stairs.

												I recieved this game for free from Humble Bundle and I heard all the fanboys rave about it. My opinion is...is that it's BORING! You're better off playing xcom:ew or playing xcom 2. It's not even that the graphics bother me. It's more just like there' s hardly no story. Playing this game just made me feel like I should be playing Fallout 1 or 2. At least those games had a lot of sh** to do. People complain about the difficulty. Yeah, it's hard. But, it's not even satisfying to kill aliens when you eventually do kill them. Don't waste your time. This game is dated and there's WAYYYY better games to play. Oh, and some people are gonna say, but, what about the modding?!? Don't you want to mod? Yeah, I did that. It was STILL BORING! Do yourself  a favor and play something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I forgot how slow this game was and the graphics are so rough to me now. Still, it is slightly nostalgic for me much the way original  Doom and Wolfenstein are. Can't really recommend it, though. X-COM: Enemy Unknown is much better, with the Unreal engine. Same basic type of turn-based  gameplay with storyline and graphics that are at least somewhat interesting, if you want to play an older game.I am already deleting UFO Defense due to it's annoying me in a jaded sort of way. What is this far past should stay there.			",53,5,0,5,2,0,5

 Certainly a classic, but a product of its own time I can see why this game and its sequels are so revered: the sheer scope of your options is so vast and varied, you really get the feeling that you're a part of a much larger world, and it's not simply a game script feeding you pre-determined scenarios.However, this is one of those very old games that have ""unwritten rules"" that you only come by after repeated attempts at trial and error (e.g. always use ""Auto Shot"" instead of ""Aimed Shot,"" dedicate your resarch to such-and-such immediately, don't use tanks because they're useless, etc.). Given the complexity of this game, you can expect to lose many, many times before making the tiniest smidge of progress. Even the many FAQs and walkthroughs that exist give contradictory information (not to mention that one shouldn't have to consult a walkthrough just to be able to play a game).I can imagine that when this came out in the sparse game market of the mid-90s, that it was absolutely amazing. I suspect a lot of the positive reviews for it come from people who played it when it first came out. Back then, you wouldn't mind spending hours upon hours playing, even if you were defeated each time. However, games have advanced considerably since then, and its outdated mechanics and unforgiving gameplay make it downright frustrating for new players. Losing is rarely fun.Short version:  If you're looking for a fun strategy game, I recommend buying the reboot, X-COM: Enemy Unknown. It preserves what was great about the original series with updated, simplified mechanics.  If you heard this is a classic and you're curious, I recommend watching a Let's Play of it instead. Those people have played it before and know the ""right"" way to play the game. It will save you time AND grief!  If you played this before and loved it, yeah, buy it! Or, check out OpenXCom, an open-source clone of the original game which fixes a lot of problems with running the game on modern machines. ",137,46,0,15,2,0,13

												I used to love this game.  Now it seems different some how.  No matter where I set up my first base, they avoid that country and I never get to shoot anything down.  And I do mostly Terror missions.  They always show up in the same country on the oposite side of the planet from me.  In combat the aliens are way more capable then they used to be.  They are throwing alien grenades at my ramp by turn 2 over buildings.			",32,11,0,13,19,0,33

												So I finally am sitting down to try out these well renowned classics. First stop is the original X-Com: UFO Defense. Right off the bat I have to give props to whoever was behind the porting. The game runs beautifully and even scales well on a full 1080p display. The sound also is fully functional with only some minor skipping in the opening cutscene. If you were into this game and have a lot of nostalgia for it, then you will love this masterful port.As a brand new player of the X-Com games, I can’t say I have much interest in this original title. I have no doubts that it was a phenomenal experience back upon release, but some games age better than others and the rose tint of nostalgia goggles only works for games you grew up with. UFO Defense has no semblance of a tutorial. I have a feeling that the original game had an awesome manual (as all classic titles did) but Steam doesn’t sell games in boxes. Without a tutorial I had to do a lot of trial and error. Fortunately I understand the premise of the game, but even knowing how the game is supposed to play out I was constantly struggling with the interface and cryptic icons. It took almost 30 minutes of play before I was ever able to see the ground combat and once the mission was underway I quickly lost all patience for the interface. I’m spoiled from all the advancement in interface design and increase in screen real estate, trying to navigate the battlefield and direct my soldiers was nothing but frustrating.X-Com: UFO Defense was the spark that started one of gaming's classic and highly regarded franchises but I don’t think it’s aged well. The port is phenomenal and those who grew up with it will be thrilled with this trip down memory lane. However, newcomers will more than likely be put off.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												Playing this game with OpenXCOM mod suite is a must for modern hardware. While mostly a fun experience, I strongly dislike games that go like thus: your strategy is fine and you are trading blows with the enemy....until suddenly an enemy type appears that ignores armor, can pretty much move across the map, and has instant death one-shots that spawn zombies/clones of that enemy type (at first, I thought chrysalids' movement had to be a game bug - nope). Cheap enemies that make you have to pretty much restart your game are not challenging. They're annoying and add difficulty for no reason other than to allow the claim 'this game is super difficult! I like fairness in my games, thanks. Back to Frozen Synapse			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the original X-COM.  This is for the classic lovers.This game has no in-game tutorial, no in-game help. The control is difficult to use, with many on-screen controls but no keyboard shortcut (luckily OpenXCOM come to help).  But it is a 20 years-old games, what did I expected?  I get used to the control, I accept the graphics, I like the styles of the game.However, the game play is difficult, too difficult.  You entire squads can be killed by one enemy without you find out where he was.  Every time the squads come out of the plane, at least one was killed.  When one or two aliens were killed, a missile/bomb came and the whole squads were killed.If you have played it 20 years ago (first published in 1994), play it now to get a sense of technology advancement in these 20 years or just play it to remind you the good old days.But if you have played the new ""Enemy Unknown"" and did not played this old game before, I do not recommend you to start playing this.

												Utterly impressive--X-COM represents a classic history lesson in PC strategy games. I was not expecting to see the depth this game provides. Strategy games are not really my preferred genre, but I have to admire the early contributions this game gave to the strategy genre and give props where they are due. Twenty year ago, this was cutting edge stuff.Gamers that haven't played something this aged will have to look beyond the low resolution graphics and clunky user interface to understand that developers used to focus primarily on game play--an aspect this game provides an abundance of. Regardless, other than for nostalgia, history, or research, I would suggest something a little more modern. But if you do decide to give it a shot, this predates in-game tutorials so you'll want to read the manual if you really want to know what is going on...all 134 pages of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, my time played lies. I tried playing the vinilla and my damaged hands told me that was a terrable idea because of the, expected beause how old it is, interface and downloaded the openxcom mod. For the same reason, this is going to be short.To sum it up, The games old and it sticks out even with lots of help from mods. If you love micromanaging, terrable teaching about overly complecated game mechanics, lack of plot, and strategy that, for me, quickly became lackluster once I figured it out(no, i didnt quite because it was too hard. far more complecated, leaning towards too easy), its the game for you. Is it worth 5$? Not in my opinion. Unless your going for nastlga. All this being said, I imgine it was an amazing game when it came out, but the art of game making has just increased too much.

												Oh jeez, the pixels, the UI, jeesh.I wouldn't really recommend this game. The dated graphics and interface design made me cringe as I tried to figure out what was going on on screen and what the buttons on the HUD did. While this is the original, there are better versions out there.I wanted to experince the game that inspired quite a few awesome strategy games, but I just couldn't play it for more than a few missions.

												If you haven't experienced X-Com, then you're missing a pinnacle of turn-based strategy. That game presents suspense and action in a way not since captured. The difficulty is there, and the game will quickly punish a wrong move. Thanks to a generous save/load system, you need not suffer more than you want.

												This is, without a doubt, one of the most addictive, rewarding strategy  games I've ever played!   I honestly wished I had a computer back in the early 90's so I could've spent even more time with it back in it's hay day.  Never have I played such a game that has hated me so much for loving it.  There is a steep learning curve, a curve that's even higher if you're like me and didn't bother to RTFM before playing.  Once you get into it though, learning the ins and outs of base management and soldier development, manufacturing and researching the best items, and figuring out the strategies of the sometimes infuriating alien enemies, you will find an in-depth strategy game like no other.  Just be prepared to have your soldiers die...a lot!...Friggin' chrysalids!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even though it's still an amazing game today with very deep and enchanting gameplay the game can feel dated at times and later battles get tedious as you gain more soldiers to control each turn. I'm investing all my hopes into the Firaxis remake coming out later this year, but will definitely keep enjoying the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Did you know X-COM was on Steam? Do you not already own it? If you don't, take a moment to feel ashamed, and then read on.Set in an alternate 1998 in which the world is being slowly infiltrated by a sinister group of aliens, X-COM is a tactical turn-based strategy game with a very deep research/production metagame that involves capturing alien technology and adapting it for use in the field. There's a great deal of pressure to advance your bureau's capabilities in this manner before the alien threat overwhelms the world, making for an unforgettable first playthrough (and subsequent playthroughs years later!).X-COM was a formative experience for me, and is a game I still refer to when discussing contemporary titles. If you missed out the first time around, I heartily recommend addressing your initial error by picking X-COM up now. Besides, it's only five bucks (and probably even less if you're reading this while Steam's having a sale).			",163,58,1,41,25,4,38

												by now most gamers already know what Xcom is about... the new updated game is a phenomena of its own right, but the classic still holds a high torch as the pinnacle of what the game stands for. New and old, both are great games and I take nothing away from the new one by any means as it is surely a game I can see myself revisiting to some degreee in years to come. I've played this game so many times in the past yet it never gets old. sure it may not have aged well, but there is something to be said about a resounding and remarkable game design, one that is so taught that even years, decades later, it still resonates with gamers, this is one of those few heralded games that is held up high for its great game design and gameplay! like curling up to to an old book you've reread so many times before like an old friend, or even if you are new and can look past the contemparary necessity for indulging graphics, if you can look past that and immerse yourself in this fine game, you will be rewarded.

												X-COM: UFO Defense is on every ""must play"" and ""classic"" list for good reason. The balance and replayability is perfect. The modern remake (X-COM: Enemy Unknown) is a great revival, but the original still feels deeper and more challenging. And for some reason the Chryssalids aren't as scary. Sure, the graphics are primitive...the game is almost 20 years old. But give it a chance and you'll see that you stop noticing the pixels. Let the KEWL GRAPHIXX BRO crowd wait around at Gamestop for the next glittering, overwrought, unbalanced Blu-ray turd while you sink your teeth into a game that will literally haunt your dreams.

(I had it on DOSBOX for years before just buying it on steam to simplify things) This is the king of strategy. The ultimate sandbox world-defense experience. A game I would say all strategy fans should try. More than that, I don't really know what I can say to try and sell this to you. Oh! One quick warning - all that the difficulty slider does is change which weapons you will encounter on your first mission. You may as well set it to max so that you can begin Heavy Plasma research ASAP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing X-COM since I was six years old, and watching my father play a few years younger.  I can't really just call it a game to me.  It's basically my life.X-COM is not a game that has aged well, in terms of UI, aesthetics, and bugginess.  You are not about to love it for its polish, where the alien grenades look like jelly-filled doughnuts.  You are not about to love it for intuitive controls, it will feel like learning a new language without a dictionary.   However, this game has implanted a long-lasting and recently rekindled legacy in Western strategy games that rivals the influence of the 4X and the East's ""Tactics"" genres.Even if you don't enjoy it, an extremely remote possibility, it is still worth trying out if only to solidify one's claim as a Strategy game enthusiast.

												One of the most intense stragety games I have ever played. If you consider yourself a hardcore stragety gamer, this is a great old school game. The game has 2 sides of it, the base building part and the battle part.The base building part is great! You deal with money and politics from around the world in order to keep your XCOM program up and working. The amount of stragety can be staggering and can ultimately help you take out the alien threat.The battle part is also great. You land to attack the alien threat and you must use cunning strategy to keep your soldiers high and dry. This game will be ruthless and unfair at times, but it will beat you down so much that you'll start to respect gamers of old. I would put this on a all-time gamers bucket-list.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Did you know X-COM was on Steam? Do you not already own it? If you don't, take a moment to feel ashamed, and then read on.Set in an alternate 1998 in which the world is being slowly infiltrated by a sinister group of aliens, X-COM is a tactical turn-based strategy game with a very deep research/production metagame that involves capturing alien technology and adapting it for use in the field. There's a great deal of pressure to advance your bureau's capabilities in this manner before the alien threat overwhelms the world, making for an unforgettable first playthrough (and subsequent playthroughs years later!).X-COM was a formative experience for me, and is a game I still refer to when discussing contemporary titles. If you missed out the first time around, I heartily recommend addressing your initial error by picking X-COM up now. Besides, it's only five bucks (and probably even less if you're reading this while Steam's having a sale).			",163,58,1,41,25,4,38

												Ah, X-COM. A game with a learning curve like running into a brick wall and a margin of error comparable to the pope's patience with me, which is to say almost nil. That said, this is an extremely engaging tactical/stratetic game that demands you exercise the 3P's of X-COM success: Planning, Patience, and Paranoia. You'll be put in charge of what amounts to the UN (but with more guns) and told to fight off incoming swarms of aliens, nick their stuff, and use it against them, then take the fight back to them. Sounds simple enough, but once you go into the game and really get your feet on the ground of your first battle, that changes. Think tactically, use your turns wisely, and never let your soldiers go Rambo, or else you'll end the mission with an even higher casualty count than usual. For those who are already familiar with turn based tactical games, try the Ironman challenge, and only save between missions. A great game series and set that's easy on the processor and the wallet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a game for the faint of heart, but definately for the battlefield commander in all of us. The aliens are invading and only a shadowy paramilitary group consisting of a handful of scientists, engineers, and soldiers can save the entire planet. X-COM's resources are at your command, will you develop laser weapons or stronger armor first? Can you risk sending your last fighter after that battleship class UFO in Germany? Is the loss of an entire squad worth risking as the aliens terrorize New York? Your choices determine the fate of the X-COM project and Earth's future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me this remains the greatest strategy game of all time, despite the decades of further game design efforts. The potentially lengthy turn based gameplay and tactical squad micro management is not for everyone. But the strategic depth and variety of emergent gameplay decisions provided by the sandbox freedom and the brutal consequences looming is second to none!In comparison this makes Firaxis' Enemy Unknown feel like a point and click adventure game, just saying.

												IMO, this is one of if not thee best game ever made.  The amount of depth offered in this game is astonishing.  You will not find a game out there that offers the customizability that this game overs, you literally have control of every aspect all the way down to naming your soldiers.  It does have some issues, but they are far overshadowed by the value you get in this game.Pros:- Customization is out of this world, literally.- Sense of accomplishment you get from completing missions is huge, the battles can really be hard and when you come home with all your guys after the mess you had to mop up it really feels like you accomplished a lot.- Some may hate the difficulty of this game, but I love it.  The aliens really are very intellegent, and if you make too many mistakes it is over.- Love the ability to have to work your way through the game with balance, you have to research, manufactor and choose your battles wisely.Cons:- This game is old, the graphics are really out of date.  Not a big deal to me, but for some this could be a problem.- There are some bugs that are very frustrating, including corrupted saves.  - Ground combat is clunky, not very fluid.  - Game difficulty can be very frustrating.

You will then get see them die at the hands of bloodthirsty technologically supperior aliums that will ♥♥♥♥ you eight ways from sunday any chance they get.I got this game fearily late at night, and decided I'd try it just a bit before going to bed.Suddenly 7 AM.I havent played that new one, though.

The first time I saw this game it was 1993 and it has been a must in my collection ever since.It is a strategy game that involves building bases, commanding and training troops, producing, trading and researching technology, and all of this in a time of war. If you want to call it that anyways.The story is about a wide variety of aliens from Mars invading Earth. You play as the organization called X-COM, an world wide organization built to monitor and investigate alien activity on Earth.It set a new standard on strategy games back then and is still widely regarded as a classic must and building block of strategy games today. Its simple and easy to understand interface, yet complex gameplay makes this a crown on any game collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had never heard about it until reading a description in the magazine itself, and was instantly intrigued. I installed the game and my gaming world changed forever.This game is too good for words. Yeah, it isn't the prettiest game after 20 years, but I'll be damned if I've ever played a game that takes this concept and does it better. Certainly not the ""remake"" by Firaxis. Yeah, it's a decent game, but it isn't anywhere close to this, right here. I have doubts to whether or not this game can ever be successfully replicated and/or updated.

												This is the best game ever created after the original Legend of Zelda.  For its time, there is nothing that even comes close to the total playability of this game.  Even today, this game is about as fun as any game you will play despite its extremely dated graphics.  I remember playing this on my dos based pc game till 5am while having Aliens playing simultaneously in the background when I was in high school.  You actually make a connection with your soldiers that you deploy.  This game is extremely detailed in both the turn based strategy combat missions, and the resource base building strategy elements needed to be successful.  The game progresses at a perfect pace.  From the opening trailer with inspiring music to the final brain battle on Mars, you'll not regret playing this timeless classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The player controlls an multi-national defence alliance from a global interface - hires and fires scientists, engineers and soldiers, builds bases and conducts missions to uncover the secrets of an invading alien force. Then they take control of turn based missions that are unpredictable and different on every playthrough. The story culminates in a massive battle with the humans harvesting the alien technology and using it against the invaders. Dynamic gameplay that offers meaningful choices to the player at every stage of the game. Risk vs. reward mechanic that pushes a conservative player out of their comfort zone, and punishes players that get too greedy too quickly. One of my favourite games of all time.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah, X-COM. A game with a learning curve like running into a brick wall and a margin of error comparable to the pope's patience with me, which is to say almost nil. That said, this is an extremely engaging tactical/stratetic game that demands you exercise the 3P's of X-COM success: Planning, Patience, and Paranoia. You'll be put in charge of what amounts to the UN (but with more guns) and told to fight off incoming swarms of aliens, nick their stuff, and use it against them, then take the fight back to them. Sounds simple enough, but once you go into the game and really get your feet on the ground of your first battle, that changes. Think tactically, use your turns wisely, and never let your soldiers go Rambo, or else you'll end the mission with an even higher casualty count than usual. For those who are already familiar with turn based tactical games, try the Ironman challenge, and only save between missions. A great game series and set that's easy on the processor and the wallet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this game as X-COM: Enemy unknown in the 90´s on my 486 pc. Any good?Really great game and yes the pixels show, I already loved this game back then and still loving it.Fixes:Heres a fix for widescreens (cause my game got stretched and made it ugly) so you can play windowed mode, found it on the internet:originally for apocalypse, but works the same..just look up the xcom ufo defense dirThe DOSBox file to tweak is dosbox.conf.(Be sure to back up the dosbox.conf file before editing it.)To run the game in a 1024×768 window, make the following edits.fullscreen=falsefulldouble=falsefullresolution=originalwindowresolution=1024×768output=ddraw If the game feels a little sluggish running under DOSBox, experiment with the cycles setting. Anywhere between 20000 or 30000 will do.cycles=20000 I have my XCOM working at 1152x864 resolution, works perfectly in windowed mode. Make sure you overwrite the file by clicking on the original file when you save it (by viewing all files you will see the file, click on it overwrite and play).With this fix you can buy the game from steam and still enjoy playing it through steam on a widescreen. Happy gaming!! Works on xcom apocalypse terror from the deep ufo defense.Recommend it?Yes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, despite being one of the best strategy games of all time, it does have some rough patches.Okay, a lot of rough patches. Ugly UI is the main one.However, with a quick, free download of a mod called OpenXcom, your experience with this game gets insanely better. I've put 13 more hours into the original version, but many more hours into the OpenXcom version of this fantastic game.So yeah, just go to OpenXcom, pick up that mod, and bingo bango bongo, you've got a game that looks like it's just a fantastic indie game from 2015 with a retro art style.

												I recall spending hours playing this as a youth.  It was unique at the time. I had never seen anything like it.  It was a thinking game.  You had to use small unit tactics to get the job done, or your squad would be history.  I remember being wowed by discovering the next alien to show up.  It was  a great game then, and it is still a very good game.  No, it hasn't got the awesome visual effects, the incredible sound effects that modern games do, but its got great mechanics. Every mission is a challenge, especially when sectoids are mind controlling you squad members and using them against you.  There is  always element of chaos, where you never know what is going to happen next, and a bit of bad luck can make you have to rethink your tactics on the fly.  Toward the end, some of the missions get pretty routine as your solders get tougher and more experienced, but there is always that one last mission looming ahead; the end game that puts a stop, once and for all, to the alien menace.  You know during in those final few missions you're gearing up or the big one.			",24,2,0,3,3,0,5

												X-Com is a classic for a good reason. Fans of Turn-Based Strategy are sure to enjoy this game, although perhaps that genre alone isn't entirely adequate to describe it. I'd call it a sort of Turn-Based Survival Horror game. Whenever you embark on a new mission, you can never know where the next alien might be hiding - one rash move and your best men could be eviscerated by some unseen alien monstrosity. Fights feel like a genuine struggle to survive the onslaught. This game is very much worth the purchase, and if the emulated nature of the game doesn't appeal to you, OpenXcom is definitely something to check out.			",113,17,0,16,10,1,12

												This is more of my experience playing X-COM: UD and making a few comparisons to XCOM 2012. Btw, I don't play this on Steam.XCOM 2012 was a great game that allowed you to field a maximum of 6 units in a single base throughout the whole game, a good compromise to keep things simple. Well let me tell you about Microprose's X-COM: UFO Defense. This game gives you a worldwide organization, making it more complex, letting you build multiple bases around the world unlike the new XCOM that limits you to one base, making you put all your eggs in one basket, but the new game won't give you that danger, unless it's scripted. UFO Defense does give you that possible danger. When the enemy discovers a base, they're going to make attempts to crash your base with a fairly large death squad. If you survive the first surprise assault on your base, at that point you now know your base is compromised, so either you could increase defenses and wait for another invading party to arrive or you can move everything you're allowed to take with you to another base.Having multiple base, you could have countless operatives stationed around the world and up to 20 can be suited up per mission. That being said, after you give them a name and a weapon, you'll be watching them go down on every wrong turn they take. A seasoned veteran will see good men and women die in this game from the beginning to the end. I usually take around 30 minutes customizing item loadouts for each of my operatives, treating them as individuals only to watch them take plasma to the chest as soon as they walk down the Skyranger's ramp. Instantly killed. At the end of the mission, a handful survive. Don't let the game discourage you, that right from the start, you get the feeling of being the little guy who is fighting an uphill battle and losses are plenty. On a side note: something popular within the community is that you want to increase the emotional impact of losses by giving your operatives familar names.If you want to enhance the game*, while keeping the vanilla experience, go towww.openxcom.orgDownload the latest stable build and overwrite it with the nightly build. Nightly builds are perfectly stable now. You'll get the latest fixes and they update nightlies daily. They also work on this game without expecting any money, so go donate to these wonderful folks.Then if you want to add mods easily and trust me you want mods, go towww.openxcom.com*You need to buy the game so OpenXcom can run. Totally worth it.If you want to chat with other X-COM veterans or general turn-based strategy fans, you could check out the forums from OpenXcom and StrategyCore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've gotta say that this is one of the best tactics games out there.while, at first, I thought that this was really difficult and has a really hard to use gui. I've found that it is actually quite nice. Another thing that impressed me was that most of the technology you get from reverse engineering the aliens tech. so you have to beat it to use it. All the alien technologies in the game have some amount of lore. in addition to that your guys are horrible at aiming until they gain several ranks but they usually dont last long enough for that. I will warn you that this is hard at least at first and just because you beat the mission doesnt mean you will increase your score.It is also cool how the aliens have superior technology so you have to have superior tactics to kill them. most of your guys will die in 1 or 2 shots from the aliens but they can usually stand around 2-3 and sometimes the more powerful aliens can withstand more in the region of 8 shots. In the story, the different countries of the world in their fear of the alien threat have banded together to fund the xcom project to aid in the protection of earth. Each month you are evaluated on your score gain/loss during that month. If you did well they will increase your monthly salary but if you do bad they will decrease it.oh and you can also destroy walls if they get in your way and you have a strong enough gun. (A rifle is strong enough to destroy wooden walls.)I would definitely rate this a 5/5 game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even after 20-years, ""X-COM:Ufo Defence / UFO: Enemy Unknown"" still stands out to a very good tactical-strategy-game that (almost) no one hasn't been able to replicate.And with the ""OpenXcom""-project, the game gets new breath-of-life with the combined age-old-fan-patches that fix game-breaking bugs alongside allowing to (optionally) tweak and modify the gameplay for ones liking. Worth of course is to mention the various compatibility features to make playing the game more comfortability on modern systems (E.G. various-types of windowed-modes available).Yeah, I personally pretty much am not able to bring anything new to table when it comes to ""reviewing"" this (and ""Terror From Deep"").But the ""X-com Complete Pack"" available here on Steam worth buying even when you're just using them as resources / assets for the ""OpenXcom""-version.Which pretty is the main reason for this ""review"": Buy this / these game(s) here to get an official-copy and play the game(s) via OpenXcom!

												Played this game as X-COM: Enemy unknown in the 90´s on my 486 pc. Any good?Really great game and yes the pixels show, I already loved this game back then and still loving it.Fixes:Heres a fix for widescreens (cause my game got stretched and made it ugly) so you can play windowed mode, found it on the internet:originally for apocalypse, but works the same..just look up the xcom ufo defense dirThe DOSBox file to tweak is dosbox.conf.(Be sure to back up the dosbox.conf file before editing it.)To run the game in a 1024×768 window, make the following edits.fullscreen=falsefulldouble=falsefullresolution=originalwindowresolution=1024×768output=ddraw If the game feels a little sluggish running under DOSBox, experiment with the cycles setting. Anywhere between 20000 or 30000 will do.cycles=20000 I have my XCOM working at 1152x864 resolution, works perfectly in windowed mode. Make sure you overwrite the file by clicking on the original file when you save it (by viewing all files you will see the file, click on it overwrite and play).With this fix you can buy the game from steam and still enjoy playing it through steam on a widescreen. Happy gaming!! Works on xcom apocalypse terror from the deep ufo defense.Recommend it?Yes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sitting here thinking about how to start this thing off because how much the game differs with mods. Unless your going to use OpenXcom or another modding software your experience won't be maximized. The bare game has a bunch of little things that will annoy you, such as not being able to see units weight capacity in the loadout screen. Also if you are an achievement hunter, you won't get them if use OpenXcom.However, since the mods like OpenXcom are free and INSANELY easy to install, this game is a MUST OWN simply for the experience. With how cheap it is there is no excuse. And remember, rotate them saves!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There was a Time when Games werent just Games. Games were a place where the  boys became Men. Or crying heaps of Pity. all depending on Skill and Knowledge.Legends of those time have passed on and names such as Megaman, Contra and But one name should come to mind as well. XCOM.You may not think its too hard, but its one of those Games  where ""easy"" means ""Hard as Balls"" and the Hardest difficulty means ""I'll salute you if you make it past the first half a Year""however, if you manage to get the hang of it, you will see, practically TASTE the fun.Yes, this is a game from the early 90s, yes its not graphical on-par, but this is the defining game for Turn Based Strategy with a very Unique Skill improvement System and a very detailed Ufopedia, explaining enemy races, weapons and technology in suprisingly good detailnow get out there and Kick some Alien♥♥♥♥♥ Soldier!

												X-COM: UFO Defense is on every ""must play"" and ""classic"" list for good reason. The balance and replayability is perfect. The modern remake (X-COM: Enemy Unknown) is a great revival, but the original still feels deeper and more challenging. And for some reason the Chryssalids aren't as scary. Sure, the graphics are primitive...the game is almost 20 years old. But give it a chance and you'll see that you stop noticing the pixels. Let the KEWL GRAPHIXX BRO crowd wait around at Gamestop for the next glittering, overwrought, unbalanced Blu-ray turd while you sink your teeth into a game that will literally haunt your dreams.

												This game was one of the main games played during my childhood, a game which actually got me into the strategy genre and one which I have the most nostalgic memories of joy and rage.For those of you who have played the most recent X-com remakes (Enemy Unknown and Bureau) this title is VASTLY different, and quite clearly from the screenshots shown above, a fairly dated title at that.  However the gameplay is solid, and those of you looking for a challenging strategic game will not be disappointed.  For some people this is what they will call a ""wiki-game"", there is no tutorial or instruction on how to play it.  As the newly integrated X-Com Commander, you are left to your own devices to decide how to deal with the alien menace, trying your best to keep your investors happy, your soldiers alive and the aliens dead. Those of you who enjoy the aspect of figuring things out on your own with little to no hand-holding will really appreciate this concept.What I will warn to all of the players who begin, is that with the learning curve aside, the game can be punishingly brutal at times, the aliens start off with better technology and a greater overall advantage over your own forces.  This game will take advantage of any mistake you make and will punish stupidity without mercy.  But for this reason alone, this has made this title the favourite strategy game for a grand audience who have been playing games since the amiga and commodore era, to this day the gameplay is still highly engaging.If you do feel apprehensive about purchasing this title due to it's lack of tutorials or punishing combat, then I suggest you invest your time into one or two Let's Play series on your favourite video hosting websites.  You will no doubt find plenty to give you an idea of what's waiting for you in the cold of space.But even now as I write this, the Steam Winter Sales have been trigged, with X-com getting a 50% discount at it's already low price of £2.99.  Which translates to about less than 5 bucks everywhere else.  I personally find that to be a bit of a steal, but then I have a lot of love for the game.  But if you ever wanted a cheap classical strategy title with challenging gameplay, then by all means, snatch this up.And remember.  In space, nobody can hear you ragequit.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, for those looking for a nostalgic blast ftom the past, it is well worth the £3 to play again.  The same tech tree, the same trouble with daft troopers not firing on overwatch and the same sense of satisfaction when you kick E.T. off your planet.  About as basic as it gets, but still fun.

												tl;dr version:A fair price is... - If you like turn based strategy, buy it for $7 or less.- If you don't like this sort of thing, wait until it goes on sale for $3 or less.More details version:Pros:- Lots of tactical decisions. Night/Day missions. Civilian defense missions. Combat tactics.- Lots of weapons, species and lore to research.- Loose win conditions. Ultimately you beat the aliens, but everything in between is your call so long as you don't lose.- A lot of lore and hidden mechanics. Tactics exist and enemies have weaknesses, but you have to find them.- Hugely rewarding experience.Cons:- This game does zero hand holding. There's no tutorial; you'll have to read the manual before you start.- Can be very frustrating. I have had to uninstal this game out of irritation from time to time.- Default steam settings on the Dos Box will take some tweaking so it runs well on your computer. Easy to correct though.- Regardless of variety of missions, can become repetetive if you take a long time to figure out how to win the game.- Did I already say it is very hard and frustrating?

												I first played this game on an Amiga 1200,it had svga graphics better than the pc i later purchased in 1994.Wish the pc version looked as good as the amiga one.You can grow strangely fond of the soldiers in game as you see the growing stats they gain, and the missions, simple by the standards of today can be highly addictive.Seeking out the last alien on a map ...only to find out he has been following you.Killing the last few aliens in terror missions before they take out the last civilians.Fighting to take an enemy base against psionc alliens.Best for me was fighting mutons on battleship maps ,the modern X-Com game is good...but this is where it all began.

												The original and the best. Apocalypse comes close, but this is the best game of its type ever produced. Simple tactical gameplay surrounded by a deep global logistics setup lets you investigate the alien threat and start to fight back, defending as much of the planet as you can to make sure the world's governments continue to fund your efforts.If you've never played any of the X-COM series, this really is a case of the original being the best - especially for the price. Closely followed by X-COM Apocalypse, and the less said about the other games the better (unless you want to rip out all your hair trying to beat the ludicrously difficult second game, Terror From The Deep). If the dated graphics and interface put you off, take a look at UFO Aftermath. Made by a different company, it's a more modern tribute to the X-COM series and measures up reasonably well.

												The most recent X-Com game “Enemy Unknown” is a remake of this game. While that was a solid game which I really enjoyed it was not a dead on remake from the original game. It actually lost some game play that was available in the original game such as the different types of shots you could take and the ability to build multiple bases wherever you wanted to. If you can get past the fact that the graphics for this game were made in the early 1990s and you are a big time turn based strategy fan, I would highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game more people need to buy, it is impossable to find without looking for it, it should get more attention, it is often considered the greatest pc game of all time, and for good reason, it completely evolved gaming, many games now do not have as much content as this! This is one of those games that has only gotten better over time, it's graphics are old enough so that it looks retro, the replay value is nearly endless, it manages to be hard without being unfair, the lack of tutorial is annoying at first but it didn't take me long to figure out, the gameplay is timeless, after playing you would never beleve that it is almost 20 years old. Evan if it were $20 i would recommend it but it is $4.99 so there is no excuse not to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

EPIC, CLASSIC TURN-BASED STRATEGYBack from the days when random generators were used in games, and very well. Other than the technology tree and story ending, the game is different. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.20 years later, and it still has amazing replayability. How many games from today will be like that in 20 years?10/10This is the first of the series. Then came:(2) X-COM: Terror from the Deep (really fun; just like X-COM but mostly underwater, and MUCH more challenging - 9/10)(3) X-COM: Apocalypse (LOADS of fun, way better graphics and gameplay; ability to choose between turn-based and real-time before every mission - 10/10)(4) X-COM: Interceptor (a realtime space flight/combat sim - 2/10)(5) X-COM: Enforcer (a cheesy, basic 3D shooter where you're a robot - 1/10)(6) The Bureau: XCOM Declassified (a squad-based, tactical 3rd person shooter; plays like Mass Effect, with much less dialogue - 5/10)(7) XCOM: Enemy Unknown (an EXCELLENT reboot of the series, staying very true to the original - 10/10).(8) XCOM: Enemy Within (EPIC expansion to Enemy Unknown. Almost makes it a completely new game. 9/10)The X-COM series is phenomenal, and will be a cult classic for a long time to come.I give the whole series 9/10(10/10 without games 4-6)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over the last 15 years, I've logged at least 1,000 hours in this game. Initially, when I first played it back in 2001, I didn't know any strategies, secrets, tactics, hints, guides, or helpful advice existed. I just played and got my squads wrecked, over and over again. But, I kept playing. It was that good! Ten years later, I played it again, because I learned about the strategy guides which exist now. The game was even more exciting, because I could control the battles. Again I played in 2014, refreshing my experience and reliving the plight of X-Com. Anyway, down to the details.The graphics, by today's standards, are cheesy, super-pixelated and difficult to interpret (at times). Even cheesier is the quality of music/sound effects. However, the sound is probably the single most-definitive characteristic in the game. The ominous sound effects severely impact the immersion in the battle. Without realizing it, I get sucked into the tension, because of the ominous pulsating background noise. Finally, the turn-based battlescape strategy style which beckons for perfection. Master strategists would struggle to survive some of those battles. One word: Chryssalids.TLDR: Sci-Fi themed, turn-based strategy (with a side of Real-time Spaceship chase scenarios), in-depth immersion. P.S. - If you can't beat em, get a bigger Blaster Launcher.

I highly recommend this series for anyone interested in strategy and turn based combat games, though it's much more than either of those two genres.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall Gameplay - 7Old games? - Yes I play tons of old games. What is Xcom? - You are in charge of the world's defence against aliens. Use fighter craft to shoot down UFOs, send squads to attack any living aliens at the crash site. Collect alien technology and put it to the defense of earth. Pros - Every game different. Every mission different. Base management, crew management, work with a fixed economy.Cons - User interface takes a while to get used to. Don't accidentally click on the wrong thing in battle or you can loose your guys pretty easily. Why 7? - I have replayed this game so many times, and the fact you can save before you do something, do it, and reload if you don't like what happens means I replayed the same game several times over.

Or crying heaps of Pity. all depending on Skill and Knowledge.Legends of those time have passed on and names such as Megaman, Contra and But one name should come to mind as well. XCOM.You may not think its too hard, but its one of those Games  where ""easy"" means ""Hard as Balls"" and the Hardest difficulty means ""I'll salute you if you make it past the first half a Year""however, if you manage to get the hang of it, you will see, practically TASTE the fun.Yes, this is a game from the early 90s, yes its not graphical on-par, but this is the defining game for Turn Based Strategy with a very Unique Skill improvement System and a very detailed Ufopedia, explaining enemy races, weapons and technology in suprisingly good detailnow get out there and Kick some Alien♥♥♥♥♥ Soldier!

												X-Com is a classic for a good reason. Fans of Turn-Based Strategy are sure to enjoy this game, although perhaps that genre alone isn't entirely adequate to describe it. I'd call it a sort of Turn-Based Survival Horror game. Whenever you embark on a new mission, you can never know where the next alien might be hiding - one rash move and your best men could be eviscerated by some unseen alien monstrosity. Fights feel like a genuine struggle to survive the onslaught. This game is very much worth the purchase, and if the emulated nature of the game doesn't appeal to you, OpenXcom is definitely something to check out.			",113,17,0,16,10,1,12

Fight an alien invasion researching the alien technology to win the fight, a lot of weapons to use, research to do, things to manufacture and use\sell, aliens to kill, base management, etc...The new UFO Unknown is  very good game, but this classic is still a very rewarding game to play.

												X-COM: UFO Defense (or in the UK, X-COM: Enemy Unknown), simply put, was one of the single best games developed in the 1990's. It set the standard for turn-based strategy.Two decades later we now have two excellent new games, both inspired by the Gallop brother's masterpiece: XCOM: Enemy Unknown (Firaxis) and Xenonauts (Goldhawk Interactive). Buy them both. Play them both. And try this one, too. Think of it as the classic literature of video games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing X-COM since I was six years old, and watching my father play a few years younger.  I can't really just call it a game to me.  It's basically my life.X-COM is not a game that has aged well, in terms of UI, aesthetics, and bugginess.  You are not about to love it for its polish, where the alien grenades look like jelly-filled doughnuts.  You are not about to love it for intuitive controls, it will feel like learning a new language without a dictionary.   However, this game has implanted a long-lasting and recently rekindled legacy in Western strategy games that rivals the influence of the 4X and the East's ""Tactics"" genres.Even if you don't enjoy it, an extremely remote possibility, it is still worth trying out if only to solidify one's claim as a Strategy game enthusiast.

												I'm old enough to have played this when it was new, and it's still good fun today. Back in 1993 it was the long-awaited follow-up to Laser Squad, and successfully expanded the concept into isometric 3D, with a fun strategy element. It has a lot of quirks although unlike the sequel (Terror from the Deep) there aren't any game-breaking bugs. The interface has the kind of icon-heavy design that was popular at the time but hasn't dated well. The gameplay however is still solid, and it's still tricky, especially if you decide not to chicken out and abort the mission when your crack troops get slaughtered. Playing it many years later it's entertaining to try different strategies - rather than use the overpowered heavy plasma rifle, why not use human weapons only? Or omit the laser guns and use projectiles, or never use tanks etc.The difficulty curve is famously unforgiving. Mission one is easy, but it then becomes very hard, gets a bit easier, and then becomes very hard again. Once you get over the final hump the remaining battles become a kerb-stomp, as you have psychic soldiers and nigh-invincible flying tanks, but until that point you learn not to get too attached to your soldiers, which is frustrating because their stats improve with time, and it's horrible when your 80TU flying-suited supersoldier is dropped by a lucky shot from a monster hiding behind underneath the exit ramp. Typically the game throws a terror mission at you in the first couple of months, which resembles the opening of Saving Private Ryan - your soldiers are gunned-down before they have a chance to deploy. Then alien mind control causes the survivors to blow up their comrades. Eventually you get to do the same to the aliens, and it's sweet revenge.The Steam version runs in DOSBox. There's a popular fan mod called XComUtil which is compatible with the Steam edition, and it's recommended because it fixes a few bugs. For example the game's original difficulty menu didn't work properly - it always reverted to ""beginner"" at the end of turn one - which was a mixed blessing because the game was still very hard.This is also one of those fondly-remembered titles that defied attempts to write a good sequel - reminiscent of Mechwarrior 2 or Syndicate in that respect. The franchise was extended into real-time 3D space action and then first-person 3D, but the original is still the best. The graphics have a subtle manga look that was very novel in the west in 1993, and still looks good today.I haven't played the direct sequel, Terror from the Deep, which replaced the graphics and tweaked the gameplay; it's apparently very buggy and gets monotonous, although for the current low price I will probably try it out at some point.Here in the UK X-Com was released as UFO: Enemy Unknown, and I always wondered if it was loosely based on the old Gerry Anderson series UFO.

A game I would say all strategy fans should try. More than that, I don't really know what I can say to try and sell this to you. Oh! One quick warning - all that the difficulty slider does is change which weapons you will encounter on your first mission. You may as well set it to max so that you can begin Heavy Plasma research ASAP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For anyone not having played this game, please do so immediately. I do not care whether it is Steam, GOG, or some other distribution service. It is a game whose mechanics, if not the visuals, stand the test of time. X-Com: Enemy Unknown is merely an homage. It is a good homage and does good service to the original, but there really is nothing like playing the original and marveling at the combination of well-balanced systems and mechanics that a small group of designers came up with way back when.

												XCom brings alot to the table for its age. This game revolves around turn based tactical combat during encounters and an global management system. There is a currency system in game and base layout/management. XCom is a classic and even if you've never beaten the game it's still fun to play so many years after its release.  Nothing beats that feeling when you prepare your crews and set up base in anticipation of detecting your first UFO on radar. When it happens you won't forget that rush when you attempt to down your first UFO and not to mention the threatening dread and creepfactor when you deploy to examine the crash site.  While the graphics are dated there's something about XCom that really gets it right in so many aspects. Once you get used to research chains, selling crafted equipment and navigating the interface it won't seem so overwhelming. Once you are familiarized with the AI's nasty little tricks and how to manage your team's items and movement XCom really reveals it's charm. With little need for powerful hardware and a save feature available at any time there's huge casual replay values. There is even a mobile version called PocketUFO that you can find online for your phone. It's amazing how well XCom holds up after so much time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun turn based battle strategy game. It was awesome back in 1995. It is still pretty great! I loved this game before the turn of the century! lol!! I can't believe I had found a 3 pack of XCOM games on sale for $5 or $15 back then. What a great game!I absolutely love how if you shoot High Explosives into a wall, it can disentregrate! Pros:Can always buy more soldiers!All soldiers have newly generated stats!Soldiers can gain ranks and increase their current stats!Soldiers with high strength are a good choice for heavy weapons.Heavy weapons have 2-3 types of ammo. AP-Armor Piercing; HE-High Explosive; I-Incindiary(Fire)A great selection of grenades and even high explosives.Why bother with high explosives, if you can assign a soldier to carry a rocket launcher! (lol)Can research recovered alien weapons and aircraft!Tactics and gun fire during battle are great!If you leave enough movement points for a soldier at the end of the round, they will be able to fire their weapons at enemies during the enemy's round, if the enemy walks into their view.Can kneel to increase accuracy and decrease size.Lots of different types of aliens to fight, recover, and research!Can capture aliens for research!There is never an easy fight just because you have the best armor available. You still have to use your brains.Your factories can build everything you have researched, except for Elerium 115.Need for the resource Elerium 115 forces you to locate more aliens to advance your equipment.Cons:All soldiers are desired to have high accuracy. Unless you use them as a medic or psychic.Can not train soldiers outside of combat.Soldiers can be one-shot killed with heavy weapons, even while wearing heavy armor.There is no quick way to run through 10 battles.Battles become repetitive, but by this time you will have aquired enough money to explore using big weapons during combat. (Which caused me to use the Ghost Buster's theory of blowing holes in walls at and around any enemy seen, no matter how much damage it would cause. lol. ""Its a little alien... Arm the rocket launcher! Auto fire the incindiary explosives from the auto cannon!"" BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! KA-BOOM!)Small bugs that you would never normally see. (Assigning more than 256 scientists to the same research project will cause a roll-over into negative integers. This will either cause you to have an infinite number of scientists for many projects, or if you ever roll the number of available scientists to zero - it will cause you to have zero scientists with zero lab space for the scientists. -But like I said, you will NEVER see this bug while playing a regular game. But a regular game would take over a hundred hours to play. Giving yourself a hundred million dollars will give you the means to build 6 research laboratories (300 lab seats), and then hiring 300 scientists to research. What would normally take over half a year of game time to research with earned funds and two dozen scientists.) For some reason, this seems to have caused another bug where I am not shown what I researched when research is complete. But playing this game for a full nother 500 hours is not what I had in mind. I just want to beat the game, since I no longer have my save file from 1996.My old 2010 review follows:""However, I did get bored when I started tracking the aliens back to their home planet in space. Became a huge amount of repetition, taking over space ships and the alien home base. When I got bored I stopped playing, even though I was really close to the end game. Repetition = torture in my book.Very fun game! Wish they would make a 'good' sequal that wasn't the same game over and over again. For example, XCOM 2 was the same game as XCOM 1, but in the oceans of earth instead of on land. But all the equipment was changed and modified to be underwater equipment. I'm sure the aliens were different too.""			",245,34,3,53,13,1,25

												This game was one of the main games played during my childhood, a game which actually got me into the strategy genre and one which I have the most nostalgic memories of joy and rage.For those of you who have played the most recent X-com remakes (Enemy Unknown and Bureau) this title is VASTLY different, and quite clearly from the screenshots shown above, a fairly dated title at that.  However the gameplay is solid, and those of you looking for a challenging strategic game will not be disappointed.  For some people this is what they will call a ""wiki-game"", there is no tutorial or instruction on how to play it.  As the newly integrated X-Com Commander, you are left to your own devices to decide how to deal with the alien menace, trying your best to keep your investors happy, your soldiers alive and the aliens dead. Those of you who enjoy the aspect of figuring things out on your own with little to no hand-holding will really appreciate this concept.What I will warn to all of the players who begin, is that with the learning curve aside, the game can be punishingly brutal at times, the aliens start off with better technology and a greater overall advantage over your own forces.  This game will take advantage of any mistake you make and will punish stupidity without mercy.  But for this reason alone, this has made this title the favourite strategy game for a grand audience who have been playing games since the amiga and commodore era, to this day the gameplay is still highly engaging.If you do feel apprehensive about purchasing this title due to it's lack of tutorials or punishing combat, then I suggest you invest your time into one or two Let's Play series on your favourite video hosting websites.  You will no doubt find plenty to give you an idea of what's waiting for you in the cold of space.But even now as I write this, the Steam Winter Sales have been trigged, with X-com getting a 50% discount at it's already low price of £2.99.  Which translates to about less than 5 bucks everywhere else.  I personally find that to be a bit of a steal, but then I have a lot of love for the game.  But if you ever wanted a cheap classical strategy title with challenging gameplay, then by all means, snatch this up.And remember.  In space, nobody can hear you ragequit.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I always found the brutal difficulty of X-Com to be peculiarly satisfying. For the first few missions the best you can hope for are pyrrhic victories. Your untested and underequipped soldiers are just no match for the high-tech alien menace. They raid the cities of the earth with impunity. France drops funding and begins to conspire with the aliens. You may begin to despair.As you suffer, though, your squad grows more and more powerful. You unlock new technologies that put you on par with the invaders. You finally have a chance. The victories come more regularly, as do exciting new discoveries.By the end game you have cultivated an army of power-armored supersoldiers with terrible psychic powers. Your enemies quail at the sight of your squad. Once terrible foes are now your puppets, forced to gun down their comrades or simply drop plasma grenades at their own feet.It is immensely satisfying, in a way that few games today are. Will we ever get a proper new X-Com? Of course not.Update: OH WAIT WE DID!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy this game. Buy it right now. Why are you still reading this? OK fine... Buy this game because it's simply unique. Like many classic games from the past Xcom relies on good solid gameplay to keep your interest. Half management sim, half turn based strategy RPG, you are in control of Xcom, the world's last line of defence against alien invasion. Get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by aliens while you resarch their technology and train your soldiers and then kick their♥♥♥♥♥in return. It's a lot more complex than that with lots to do and one hell of a learning curve, but ultimately one of the most rewarding games you will ever play.

												X-Com is the only game where you will spend hours shaping a team of elite badasses into psychic jetpack-wearing ultra badasses in power armor and then blowing them all up when one guy goes nutso under alien mental attack and explodes your landing craft with a rocket launcher. 7/5Okay, really, it's a great turn-based tactical shooter, and there hasn't been another game like it (except like two sequels and a spiritual sequel on the GBA, but those are basically the same game.) You should at least find a copy on some abandonware site and try it once or twice. It's not pretty, but it's damned good, and one of the scariest games ever made of nothing but sprites.

												My favorite game ever.  The (pioneering) combination of tactical combat, with strategic base management, makes the game very non-linear.  I originally played this back before FAQs and Strategy Guides, so learning the research tree by trial and error was quite facinating.  The 2012 remake was a faithful remake, but this is the one that I will always come back to.  You as a player have to remember all the trivial aspects, such as remembering to save time for returning your soldiers to cover, crouching, and having time for overwatch.  Your soldiers have a high mortality rate, but (while alive) they have many individual statistics and personal growth.  It is easy to get familiar with a character, just to watch the character die in a later mission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing X-COM since I was six years old, and watching my father play a few years younger.  I can't really just call it a game to me.  It's basically my life.X-COM is not a game that has aged well, in terms of UI, aesthetics, and bugginess.  You are not about to love it for its polish, where the alien grenades look like jelly-filled doughnuts.  You are not about to love it for intuitive controls, it will feel like learning a new language without a dictionary.   However, this game has implanted a long-lasting and recently rekindled legacy in Western strategy games that rivals the influence of the 4X and the East's ""Tactics"" genres.Even if you don't enjoy it, an extremely remote possibility, it is still worth trying out if only to solidify one's claim as a Strategy game enthusiast.

												I'm old enough to have played this when it was new, and it's still good fun today. Back in 1993 it was the long-awaited follow-up to Laser Squad, and successfully expanded the concept into isometric 3D, with a fun strategy element. It has a lot of quirks although unlike the sequel (Terror from the Deep) there aren't any game-breaking bugs. The interface has the kind of icon-heavy design that was popular at the time but hasn't dated well. The gameplay however is still solid, and it's still tricky, especially if you decide not to chicken out and abort the mission when your crack troops get slaughtered. Playing it many years later it's entertaining to try different strategies - rather than use the overpowered heavy plasma rifle, why not use human weapons only? Or omit the laser guns and use projectiles, or never use tanks etc.The difficulty curve is famously unforgiving. Mission one is easy, but it then becomes very hard, gets a bit easier, and then becomes very hard again. Once you get over the final hump the remaining battles become a kerb-stomp, as you have psychic soldiers and nigh-invincible flying tanks, but until that point you learn not to get too attached to your soldiers, which is frustrating because their stats improve with time, and it's horrible when your 80TU flying-suited supersoldier is dropped by a lucky shot from a monster hiding behind underneath the exit ramp. Typically the game throws a terror mission at you in the first couple of months, which resembles the opening of Saving Private Ryan - your soldiers are gunned-down before they have a chance to deploy. Then alien mind control causes the survivors to blow up their comrades. Eventually you get to do the same to the aliens, and it's sweet revenge.The Steam version runs in DOSBox. There's a popular fan mod called XComUtil which is compatible with the Steam edition, and it's recommended because it fixes a few bugs. For example the game's original difficulty menu didn't work properly - it always reverted to ""beginner"" at the end of turn one - which was a mixed blessing because the game was still very hard.This is also one of those fondly-remembered titles that defied attempts to write a good sequel - reminiscent of Mechwarrior 2 or Syndicate in that respect. The franchise was extended into real-time 3D space action and then first-person 3D, but the original is still the best. The graphics have a subtle manga look that was very novel in the west in 1993, and still looks good today.I haven't played the direct sequel, Terror from the Deep, which replaced the graphics and tweaked the gameplay; it's apparently very buggy and gets monotonous, although for the current low price I will probably try it out at some point.Here in the UK X-Com was released as UFO: Enemy Unknown, and I always wondered if it was loosely based on the old Gerry Anderson series UFO.

												The best turn based strategy games of all time but one of the most difficult when played on the higher levels of difficulty. This game will punish you. The A.I is remarkably deadly for a game created in 1994 because you will lose count of how many times your soldier gets killed on the first turn when walking out on to the skyranger ramp. The sense of dread when you have to do a terror mission when chrysalid's are about, the tense atmosphere when entering a shot down ufo only for an sectoid to take a shot at you instantly as you walk through the door and when your intercepter gets down to 5% health from a single large ufo shot. The eerie music on every misson supporting the tense atmosphere makes this game one of the greatest of all time.If you want the defintion of impossible try playing this on superhuman difficulty placing your first base in the antartica then doing a terror mission at night time.

												This is the best game ever created after the original Legend of Zelda.  For its time, there is nothing that even comes close to the total playability of this game.  Even today, this game is about as fun as any game you will play despite its extremely dated graphics.  I remember playing this on my dos based pc game till 5am while having Aliens playing simultaneously in the background when I was in high school.  You actually make a connection with your soldiers that you deploy.  This game is extremely detailed in both the turn based strategy combat missions, and the resource base building strategy elements needed to be successful.  The game progresses at a perfect pace.  From the opening trailer with inspiring music to the final brain battle on Mars, you'll not regret playing this timeless classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short: X-COM UFO Defense is simply a fantastic and immersive strategy game. It is very complex, but is still easy to learn and understand. The game gives the player lots of options and freedom in defeating the alien invasion. The variety of options also creates a large replay value. Long: To begin, the Windows 7 version runs via DosBox. The default settings limit the cycle speed, meaning the game can have very low FPS counts sometimes. Manually changing the cycle limit will allow you to increase the FPS for smoother gameplay.The controls via DosBox are all cursor-based, as far as I know. The keyboard is simply not used at all. Keyboard controls could be useful, so I will say this is a con. The game itself has tons of options for players. There are some base management aspects, where you can build new facilities in the X-COM bases or build new bases altogether. This stuff is pretty simple (not really any micro managing) but allows for a large variety of different base configurations. Supplies and personel (soldiers, scientists, and engineers) can be bought/hired and sold/fired and can also be transferred between bases. Scientists research new technology from base labs which can allow your engineers to manufactor new weapons, vehicles, armor, or other useful things. Funding is a concern; your funding is automatically adjusted each month based on your performance in stopping the alien menace. You can also gain funds by selling supplies you find or produce.The geo map view looks nice (for Dos) and is where you order your aircraft to shoot down UFOs or to land squads at landed UFOs/crashed UFOs/terror sites/alien bases. When you land at a site, you can customize the loadout of each soldier based on what equipment was in the landing craft. Tactical combat is solid but difficult; raw recruits and even semi-skilled soldiers are absolutely terrible shots. There is a variety of different weapons, grenades, and other equipment that your soldiers can use. There are several types of aliens that are mostly quite unique from each other. After neutralizing all aliens at a site, you also automatically collect their loot--the alien weaponry and supplies can be used by your soldiers or sold for profit. By researching new technologies and interrogating captured aliens, the end-game content and final missions to beat the game are revealed. Overall, it is a very enjoyable experience and the variety of options means there is a great degree of replayability. I highly recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IMO, this is one of if not thee best game ever made.  The amount of depth offered in this game is astonishing.  You will not find a game out there that offers the customizability that this game overs, you literally have control of every aspect all the way down to naming your soldiers.  It does have some issues, but they are far overshadowed by the value you get in this game.Pros:- Customization is out of this world, literally.- Sense of accomplishment you get from completing missions is huge, the battles can really be hard and when you come home with all your guys after the mess you had to mop up it really feels like you accomplished a lot.- Some may hate the difficulty of this game, but I love it.  The aliens really are very intellegent, and if you make too many mistakes it is over.- Love the ability to have to work your way through the game with balance, you have to research, manufactor and choose your battles wisely.Cons:- This game is old, the graphics are really out of date.  Not a big deal to me, but for some this could be a problem.- There are some bugs that are very frustrating, including corrupted saves.  - Ground combat is clunky, not very fluid.  - Game difficulty can be very frustrating.

												This game more people need to buy, it is impossable to find without looking for it, it should get more attention, it is often considered the greatest pc game of all time, and for good reason, it completely evolved gaming, many games now do not have as much content as this! This is one of those games that has only gotten better over time, it's graphics are old enough so that it looks retro, the replay value is nearly endless, it manages to be hard without being unfair, the lack of tutorial is annoying at first but it didn't take me long to figure out, the gameplay is timeless, after playing you would never beleve that it is almost 20 years old. Evan if it were $20 i would recommend it but it is $4.99 so there is no excuse not to buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me this remains the greatest strategy game of all time, despite the decades of further game design efforts. The potentially lengthy turn based gameplay and tactical squad micro management is not for everyone. But the strategic depth and variety of emergent gameplay decisions provided by the sandbox freedom and the brutal consequences looming is second to none!In comparison this makes Firaxis' Enemy Unknown feel like a point and click adventure game, just saying.

												The most recent X-Com game “Enemy Unknown” is a remake of this game. While that was a solid game which I really enjoyed it was not a dead on remake from the original game. It actually lost some game play that was available in the original game such as the different types of shots you could take and the ability to build multiple bases wherever you wanted to. If you can get past the fact that the graphics for this game were made in the early 1990s and you are a big time turn based strategy fan, I would highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original and the best. Apocalypse comes close, but this is the best game of its type ever produced. Simple tactical gameplay surrounded by a deep global logistics setup lets you investigate the alien threat and start to fight back, defending as much of the planet as you can to make sure the world's governments continue to fund your efforts.If you've never played any of the X-COM series, this really is a case of the original being the best - especially for the price. Closely followed by X-COM Apocalypse, and the less said about the other games the better (unless you want to rip out all your hair trying to beat the ludicrously difficult second game, Terror From The Deep). If the dated graphics and interface put you off, take a look at UFO Aftermath. Made by a different company, it's a more modern tribute to the X-COM series and measures up reasonably well.

												X-Com is the only game where you will spend hours shaping a team of elite badasses into psychic jetpack-wearing ultra badasses in power armor and then blowing them all up when one guy goes nutso under alien mental attack and explodes your landing craft with a rocket launcher. 7/5Okay, really, it's a great turn-based tactical shooter, and there hasn't been another game like it (except like two sequels and a spiritual sequel on the GBA, but those are basically the same game.) You should at least find a copy on some abandonware site and try it once or twice. It's not pretty, but it's damned good, and one of the scariest games ever made of nothing but sprites.

Its underated and not played much because xcom enemy unknown is pretty much a remake of it and theres no multiplayer mods but still overall its only 5$ and i would give it a 9 out of 10.

												An incredibly deep strategy experience. X-COM never pulls any punches as you work hundreds of scientists over countless sleepless nights, trying to understand alien technology before your feeble human forces are swept aside. A UFO is spotted over Europe, and an alien terror mission is destroying a village in Africa. Where do you send aid? What do you do when the troops hit the ground, and what happens if you discover that you are dealing with two different aliens with two different intentions? With limited funding, balanced on the moods of the temperamental leaders of the world, you must find a way to answer these questions. But you have to answer them quickly, because when the alien threat learns of your mission they will be coming for you next. X-COM is a game of real consequences; you know what the stakes are. Anyone who enjoys a game that will be just as immensely rewarding as it is unreservedly punishing should dawn the title of X-COM Commander.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To top that all off, the sequel, Terror From the Deep, is even better (I tend to consider them to be the same game).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So much tension that when you pull even the slightest victories off, you feel rewarded. A fantastic game that refuses to hold your hand for even a second. You may want to skim the manual to learn how to operate the icon-based controls, but they're easy enough to get hang of once you know what the buttons do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												XCom brings alot to the table for its age. This game revolves around turn based tactical combat during encounters and an global management system. There is a currency system in game and base layout/management. XCom is a classic and even if you've never beaten the game it's still fun to play so many years after its release.  Nothing beats that feeling when you prepare your crews and set up base in anticipation of detecting your first UFO on radar. When it happens you won't forget that rush when you attempt to down your first UFO and not to mention the threatening dread and creepfactor when you deploy to examine the crash site.  While the graphics are dated there's something about XCom that really gets it right in so many aspects. Once you get used to research chains, selling crafted equipment and navigating the interface it won't seem so overwhelming. Once you are familiarized with the AI's nasty little tricks and how to manage your team's items and movement XCom really reveals it's charm. With little need for powerful hardware and a save feature available at any time there's huge casual replay values. There is even a mobile version called PocketUFO that you can find online for your phone. It's amazing how well XCom holds up after so much time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun turn based battle strategy game. It was awesome back in 1995. It is still pretty great! I loved this game before the turn of the century! lol!! I can't believe I had found a 3 pack of XCOM games on sale for $5 or $15 back then. What a great game!I absolutely love how if you shoot High Explosives into a wall, it can disentregrate! Pros:Can always buy more soldiers!All soldiers have newly generated stats!Soldiers can gain ranks and increase their current stats!Soldiers with high strength are a good choice for heavy weapons.Heavy weapons have 2-3 types of ammo. AP-Armor Piercing; HE-High Explosive; I-Incindiary(Fire)A great selection of grenades and even high explosives.Why bother with high explosives, if you can assign a soldier to carry a rocket launcher! (lol)Can research recovered alien weapons and aircraft!Tactics and gun fire during battle are great!If you leave enough movement points for a soldier at the end of the round, they will be able to fire their weapons at enemies during the enemy's round, if the enemy walks into their view.Can kneel to increase accuracy and decrease size.Lots of different types of aliens to fight, recover, and research!Can capture aliens for research!There is never an easy fight just because you have the best armor available. You still have to use your brains.Your factories can build everything you have researched, except for Elerium 115.Need for the resource Elerium 115 forces you to locate more aliens to advance your equipment.Cons:All soldiers are desired to have high accuracy. Unless you use them as a medic or psychic.Can not train soldiers outside of combat.Soldiers can be one-shot killed with heavy weapons, even while wearing heavy armor.There is no quick way to run through 10 battles.Battles become repetitive, but by this time you will have aquired enough money to explore using big weapons during combat. (Which caused me to use the Ghost Buster's theory of blowing holes in walls at and around any enemy seen, no matter how much damage it would cause. lol. ""Its a little alien... Arm the rocket launcher! Auto fire the incindiary explosives from the auto cannon!"" BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! KA-BOOM!)Small bugs that you would never normally see. (Assigning more than 256 scientists to the same research project will cause a roll-over into negative integers. This will either cause you to have an infinite number of scientists for many projects, or if you ever roll the number of available scientists to zero - it will cause you to have zero scientists with zero lab space for the scientists. -But like I said, you will NEVER see this bug while playing a regular game. But a regular game would take over a hundred hours to play. Giving yourself a hundred million dollars will give you the means to build 6 research laboratories (300 lab seats), and then hiring 300 scientists to research. What would normally take over half a year of game time to research with earned funds and two dozen scientists.) For some reason, this seems to have caused another bug where I am not shown what I researched when research is complete. But playing this game for a full nother 500 hours is not what I had in mind. I just want to beat the game, since I no longer have my save file from 1996.My old 2010 review follows:""However, I did get bored when I started tracking the aliens back to their home planet in space. Became a huge amount of repetition, taking over space ships and the alien home base. When I got bored I stopped playing, even though I was really close to the end game. Repetition = torture in my book.Very fun game! Wish they would make a 'good' sequal that wasn't the same game over and over again. For example, XCOM 2 was the same game as XCOM 1, but in the oceans of earth instead of on land. But all the equipment was changed and modified to be underwater equipment. I'm sure the aliens were different too.""			",245,34,3,53,13,1,25

												So, from 1995 onwards, I've played X-COM: UFO Defense (or as it was known in Europe: X-COM: UFO - Enemy Unknown) ... Over the years I have gone through painstaking efforts to ensure that I retain the ability to play the game. I kept a DOS-operated 486 PC for years until the Windows-compatible XCOM Gold edition came out, then kept an XP computer (actually still keeping it) so I could play that... I have not played it much on Steam, naturally, because I play it on the older computer anyways... Over the past twenty one years (as of 2016 when this review is written) I've clocked upwards of 1000 hours on the game, having beaten it on Superhuman difficulty several times, including, once, playing it IRONMAN style.The game is visually crude, was visually crude even in 1994. That's the only downside in an otherwise groundbreaking game that still has value today. The sound is basic 1994 sound, with good atmospheric music.The strategic level of the game is remarkable all by itself... where you place your bases, what your radar coverage and aerial coverage look like, all those make a signifcant difference. The alien invaders step up their efforts regardless of your progress so if you can't keep up, you'll be overwhelmed. managing your resources, starting from money and equipment and especially your manpower, research capabilities and what you research with them can and will make or break your gameyour soldiers stats are one of the most impressive things in the game. modern XCOM games have dumbed it down much but in this one, your squad's performance depends on a variety of complex stats - from Time Units (which determine how much your soldier can do in a turn), health and accuracy, to deeper stats like reactions (which determines a soldier's likelihood of taking an opportunity fire during the alien turn), bravery (which would determine how your soldier will get through shaking moments like seeing his squad mates die in front of his eyes) and strength (and I'll get to that below)... My strategy has been, for many years, to rename soldiers and add quick reference letters to designate best use for them at a glance (Like Helga Richter S [for Sniper] or Manfred Berger G [for Grenadier]) The tactical level starts at the strategic map, when UFOs appear on the map. You can try and intercept them or, if you are daring, try to see if they'll land and hit them on the ground. An intact UFO will grant much better loot but the catch is that it's intact and has all of its crew. Plus, there's no guarantee that UFO will land... and be wary of engaging the aliens on the ground at night time... equipping your troops is fairly straight forward, except that if you give a rocket launcher and three rockets to some poor schmuck that has low strength, the result will be comically bad. Items that are completely missing from more advanced games like smoke grenades (that have an actual usage for screening purposes) or thermal flares to light up the night make for an add layer of equipment to consider. Use of proximity grenades to mine chokepoints or incindeary ammo as a way to provide extra lighting during night missions adds as well. The environment is very destructible and in fact, you'd often find yourself thinking ""i can move around that corner... or I can destroy the wall"" and realize that destroying the wall will probably be safer... the aliens are varied and deadly, especially at night when they can see much better than you... initial alien encounters include not so tough aliens like the Sectoids... but when they bring up one of their Cyberdiscs or when the tougher Mutons show up, you'll be running for cover... The game doesn't have a boolean overwatch mode. Instead, if a soldier (or an alien) finished their turn with enough time units for a snapshot with their weapon and during the enemy's turn, they see movement from an enemy that has a smaller combined number of Reactions and Time Units, they will take a opportunity fire.. it can really ruin someone's day The game mechanics are complex and it allows for a good replayability... it's tense, it's difficult and it's fun...It's what Chess would have been like if the Persians invented it today			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is *the* classic X-COM, which I spent countless hours playing in my youth(?) and getting my nether regions handed to me. The premise is simple: Hostile aliens are invading earth, and you have to bring down their UFOs, handle crash sites, stop them from terrorizing civilization, etc. You can customize your ships, crew, soldiers (down to renaming them), and your base. I heard a rumor the Steam version is the bugfix-rewrite OpenXCOM, but the version I received is just DOSbox running the original. So, it is not bug free. However, it is just as immersive, atmospheric, and all of those adjectives I can throw into a glowing review, as I can remember. The tactical battles are a balance of exciting and harrowing turn-based fun. I would say this game has stood the test of time.Advice for playing this game: Find the manual. Read it! Save early. Save often. Realise it's not a brand new game. Experiment. And of course, have lots of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As old as me, addictive as hell.It was my first time with series and i didn't expecting so good game. Bases and cash managing is important for winnig, same reaserch and manufacturing stuff. With new technologies you feel that power of your soldiers and aircrafts is growing and after time you fight with aliens as equal with equal. Turn-based missions are also very engaging thing and night missions have even some horror feeling, when you hear all moving aliens, killing civilians, shooting from darkness and you don't know if one of them doesn't waiting after the corner to shot plasma direct into face of your soldier. Modest music is helping to build the atmosphere. And there is dectructive enviroment in game from 1994. For me old X-COM showed much better then many modern games. Ofcorse, there is some annoying archaisms, but when you get used to them, X-COM suck you into itself and doesn't realese until you destroy alien menance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't count how many hundreds of hours I've spent playing this game over the last 20 years, but my first brutal playthrough back in 1994 took 100 hours alone.  So it's safe to say I have easily over 500 hours play X-COM UFO Defense which might possibly be the best game I've ever played.  Even today, 22 years later, it's depth and immersion are superior to most of the next gen games that glut the market.  There's a reason X-COM routinely makes the top 10 list of all time greatest PC games.  If you're a stickler for uber graphics or easy games, just move along.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the games that got me into steam, partly becasue its nhy-impossible to find elsewhere. It has survived the tests of time far better than any other game that has comes to mind. However if your not a fan of Turnbased strategy games then its probably not for you. It starts off fairly indepth and just keeps digging. If you do start playing I recommend researching the Blaster Launcher as soon as you aquire one from the Aliens. Best weapon in the game, thank god for the most part the game isn't concerned with collateral damage.Edit: Still one of the best games on PC IMHO and while the new titles are a nice step towards more complex games of yore and while they are visually stunning I still don't feel that they hold a candle to the depth of the original.

												Even today, after so many years it still remains an absolute classic and a must have for anyone who enjoys strategy and/or turn based games. X-COM: UFO Defense is very complex. It's a bit overwhelming, especially to newcomers, but after mastering all of its mechanics it proves to be highly rewarding and satisfying. Probably the best thing about this title are its replayability and difficulty, which even on the lowest of 5 levels, is very high. Soundtrack, although being extremely simple, fits the game perfectly and helps creating mysterious and dark atmosphere, which is extremely addictive and enjoyable.There are some issues, like the well known difficulty bug, but all of them can be fixed with XcomUtil.I can't think of any other game, which keeps me coming back so often for so many years.

												My favourite PC game of all time, period.The first X-COM is the game I played many times, first back when I was a kid, on an old 386SX, monochrome graphics and no sound, and now on my new multicore rig, with the same enthusiasm as before. A great blend of base management, chasing UFOs all over the globe, and tactical isometric turn-based strategy, it is THE definition of 'oldschool'. Newer attempts to re-create the success of this game were more or less futile and lacking.Its graphics have aged exceptionally well (now it would be classified as 'pixelart'), the music is dramatic and suits the tense atmosphere perfectly, and there's that amazing feeling of reward when you've finally cleared the UFO crash site of alien lifeforms... Dang, I think I'll go play some more. And prod Ethereals with stun sticks. And guide blaster bombs through alien base corridors. And get horribly devastated by Chryssalids. Oh boy.*Edit* it's 2016 and this is still my all-time favorite game of all time. Seriously, go get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're not big on your cult classic game knowledge, let me tell you a bit about X-Com UFO Defense.  You are the commander of a badass 90's cool task force set up by the UN to defend the planet against Alien Invaders.  You do this by building up your bases around the planet and watching for invading UFOs and then sending out jets and squads of Huge dudes with badass haircuts and big guns to murder aliens and protect civilians. It's got an awesome top-down, 3rd-person, strategy control scheme for the fights, and surprisingly tactical and cover conscious combat.I can tell you, even as a guy who never played this game when it was first made, that it is a hell of a lot of fun.  And if you're a fan of Strategy games, sci-fi, and persistent troopers that you need to level up and keep alive.  NOT TO MENTION A BALLS HARD EVEN ON THE EASIEST DIFFICULTY GAME EXPERIENCE.Then you should probably pick this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Better graphics, Keyboard commands, better mouse functionality, improved AI and tactics all make revisiting this game a must!  You must have the original game to play OpenXcom, so I highly recommend the steam version.

												worth every penny! Don't expect the game to be without glitches and bugs. However these are all very minor and don't result in inability to progress! They are merely graphical and minor gameplay glitches such as guys in your sqaud refusing to go to a spot you clicked, this really only happens around corners and can simply be fixed by clicking a little closer to your guy. To me these do no detract at all from the games absolute retro charm! totally worth the buy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still the best turn based strategy in the history of turn based strategies (in my opinion of course).  Just in case you've lived in a cave for the last 20+ years, here it is.  Build a defense network across the globe, intercept those pesky UFO's and take them down.  Send a team of elite soldiers to battle the alien menace on the ground at the crash site, or fight them in the worlds towns as the aliens invade.  Soldiers will die, lots of soldiers will die, this ain't an easy game.  Gaming at its best.			",630,151,30,97,62,5,156

												Hard to play, hard to master. Lots of micro-management, old graphics, complicated HUD and the RNG is nerve wrecking. But still one of the most iconic games of it's genre that can be quite interesting to play especially when comparing it to the modern remake (Xcom EU/EW).Fans of old school turn based strategy games, go get it. Fans of Xcom 2012 (EU/EW) might also want to take a look. But be advised, it's harder than EU/EW, it's more complex and complicated, and it's obviously a rather old game. Have fun playing.

												Like others, this is a game I have very fond memories of - playing late at night, in the dark, on my old trust 386/40 machine back in the mid-90's.  You control a squad of soldiers looking to beat back and eventually destroy an alien menace bent on taking over our planet.  The control of individual soldiers both in equipment layout and physical movement during battle is something I have yet to see another game duplicate to this level.  It's great campy fun to research alien technology and eventually turn it against the aliens themselves in the form of better weapons and technology.  Sure, the graphics are a bit dated by todays standards but great gameplay never goes out of fashion!  And hey, this game will run great on even the oldest of laptops if you need it to.  This remains one of my all-time favorite games, right up there with Civilization, Unreal Tournament, and Half-Life as a must-own classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is *the* classic X-COM, which I spent countless hours playing in my youth(?) and getting my nether regions handed to me. The premise is simple: Hostile aliens are invading earth, and you have to bring down their UFOs, handle crash sites, stop them from terrorizing civilization, etc. You can customize your ships, crew, soldiers (down to renaming them), and your base. I heard a rumor the Steam version is the bugfix-rewrite OpenXCOM, but the version I received is just DOSbox running the original. So, it is not bug free. However, it is just as immersive, atmospheric, and all of those adjectives I can throw into a glowing review, as I can remember. The tactical battles are a balance of exciting and harrowing turn-based fun. I would say this game has stood the test of time.Advice for playing this game: Find the manual. Read it! Save early. Save often. Realise it's not a brand new game. Experiment. And of course, have lots of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We barely had a computer fast enough to run the game, but that didn't stop my brother and I from playing this game ad infinitum.This is THE game I think of when people talk about squad based tactical games. There is a unique combination of statistics, experience  gain, discovery, research, and combat. This game has so much to offer, there's no wonder I think it stands the test of time. I find myself still coming back to this game even after years of having played it.I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't played.			",60,6,0,8,3,0,19

												The original. Still unmatched, not just because of its tactical depth, but also because of its dark and foreboding atmosphere. No other game has reached this games ability to tell unique and dynamic story, be it the slow - and sometimes inevitable -descent of your squad or the rise from the ashes after a devastating blow. Never have I feared so much for the digital lives of my squad members. Never have I felt so utterly powerless, but never have I felt better after beating a game and kicking some alien butt.10 out of 10 Squadmates			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game!Great game for its time and it still holds of fairly well because it was so well made and thought out. This is the game that started the whole xcom saga and made big a whole concept of squad turn bases strategy that is brutal and unforgiving for both sides.If you like strategy, complexity, decition making, base building, tactical combat, resource management, research and if nothing else destroying aliens this is the game for you.It would take a long page and bore you to say everything about the game thats good and bad. Just know its a big huge complicated game. I will say some of the mechanics are still not done in the reboot games of enemy within and xcom 2 and wish they were. Sadly some of the complexity bogs the game down a lot. Everything is big. Lots of staff, weapons, bases, research ect. The game is very un streamlined. Some ways its beautiful and other ways just painful. I do enjoy the Turn Units system of turns. Each unit has points on its turn to use any way they want. Everything uses points, walking, attacking (depending on weapon), turning (yes turning since you have a facing view of hm 1/4), walking (again ya agian as in walking up stairs or rough terrain is more), crouching (ya you can do that as it increases your aim) ect. It gave great flexability. It means if you dont move and have a uhm low TU cost weapon you could get many overwatch shots off not just 1 burst.Any how its an amazing game. If you like indepth complex squad strategy with some base building and research involved you MUST play this as the grand dady of them all. You have to play and beat this game at least 1 time! Beware its a hard game and you will probably lose many handfulls of soldiers. Its sad but hay its war as long as you are killing say 1-2 handfuls of aliens and only lose 0-2 soldiers you are still by the numbers winning so congratulatoins. Early on brace your self to lose several soldiers a mission. Also note that any point if the game a max damage crit shot can kill any of your soldiers so dont get too attached. Its just war sorry.The 2nd game Terror From The Deep did stream line the game fairly well but was a 2 steps forward 1 step back having its own new problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

X-COM is a strategy game like no other. X-COM give you almost absolute flexibility and control. Play this X-COM before you play any other. The other versions are dumbed down version of this game. P.S. My 251 hours of game play are only after I bought this version.			",50,24,0,13,14,0,17

												Quite simply the best game ever made. I keep an old computer just to play this (dos-box hasn't quite got it right yet).Such a shame the re-release was dumbed down for consoles. The whole reason this original game was good was the amount of choices you have at any time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had to give up X-COM: UFO Defence when I switched to W7, but the Steam version runs great! Sound and graphics problems all fixed! Head for the Skyranger, trooper! There's Sectoids to kill!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
