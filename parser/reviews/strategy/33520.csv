UPD: I have not touched T5 yet so I'm not mentioning it till I get to play it! That said, it's got some very favorable and well written reviews thus far, so go check 'em out!Tropico the first's a classic. Having been a huge fan of Sim City and Tropico games (SC4/2000 and original Tropico) for years, I keep coming back to those games at least once in a couple of years just for nostalgia's sake. Tropico 1 possesses that unique charm that nearly all the other installations, sadly, lack, alongside with some great tongue-in-cheek humor. I can say with certainty however that Tropico 4 more than made up for it and it's probably the only game out of the entire franchise worth purchasing (besides the very first one of course), seeing as T3 is just a watered down version of T4. Trust me, if you just skip on T3 you won't be missing ANYTHING. Kalypso really dropped the ball on that one.So if you're looking to jump into the franchise, I recommend starting with either the 1st or the 4th installation, or better yet both. If you just want a fancy looking and relatively new city-building game in the spirit of SimCity, Anno and Cities XL, just skip this bundle entirely and buy T4.Long story short: T1 started it all, T2 has pirates, T3 is an attempted but shallow reboot and T4 is an upgraded version of the previous game and what T3 should have been in the first place. Take your pick.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After much debate, this game gets a thumbs up, for one main reason:  nostalgia.  I played the crap out of this game when I was a kid, and upon rediscovering it, proceeded to continue to play the crap out of it.  If you're unfamiliar, this is a simulation where you play a dictator of a small caribbean island.  The plots and themes are all very cliche'd, but humorously delivered by a suck-up lackey of yours, Penultimo (""the second to last,"" if you're keeping up with your spanish).  You can be kind or ruthless, out for a buck or for glory, but in the end, this is a solid, interesting game worthy, I think, of a modern gamer's time.  HOWEVER... if you have played the newest Tropico (4, at this point), I would not recommend this one to you.  The gameplay is more or less identical, but the options are significantly fewer and the graphics aren't remotely of the caliber of modern games. Additionally, it should be noted that this game relies very heavily on latino sterotypes, and while I (a Latin American History major, but with no soul) found it amusing, many of the japes could be found highly offensive.  So, in essence:Recommended for: players of strategy simulations, people who enjoy latin american history in a comical simulated retelling, or those who are interested to see how a game series has evolved from it's origins.Not recommended for:  Enthusiasts of the newest games, those demanding high quality graphics, or folk who will be easily offended by latino sterotypes.

												Have you, like me, got an old, slow, crappy laptop as your only source of PC gaming? Are you wanting a game that will suck you in for most of your day off work or studies?If so I highly recommend Tropico. I've been playing this game for many years and although it may be no where near as glossy as it's newer cousins in the series it still has a nice bit of depth to it, a superb soundtrack and a wicked sense of humour.I love this game. It's one of the most re-visited in my collection. I hope you'll love it too.			",179,43,3,49,64,1,76

												The amount of time I've spent on this game is uncountable, and when I saw it on Steam, well I just had to buy it. Tropico allows you to unleash your inner dictator (of cause you can also lead you island in a fair and democratic way, but what’s the fun in that?). Tropico is an awesome game in the way it manages to capture that ""el presidente""-feeling. The game is really a sort of “Banana republics for dummies” in the way it quite humorously touches serious matters such as totalitarianism, corruption (for instance hinted through the role that the Swiss bank plays), election fraud, and the interventions the Cold War superpowers (the United States and Soviet Union).The primary goal in Tropico is to stay in power! If you can manage this you’re on the right track. You can play a “Scenario” in which staying in power alone isn’t enough to grant you the victory. The scenarios will challenge different aspects of your leadership and somewhat improve your skills. If you don’t feel like play a scenario, the “Custom game”-mode allows you to set the goal and premises of the game.All in all, it’s just a brilliant game! Great humour and the music is awesome, it really helps setting the mood!If you’re a fan of the Tropico-series and you somehow haven’t yet played the first title, you should really consider buying this game. Also, it delivers great entertainment without demanding to much of your computer (which makes it ideal for older computers).The entire series is really great fun, but this game is really a must have!

												Tropico Reloaded is a pack that contains 2 first games of Tropico series, all of which are town-managment games. Tropico 1 makes you a dictator of tropical island during cold war. It also comes with Paradise Island expansion pack already patched in, which adds random storms and more buildings for tourists. And Tropico 2 makes you manage a pirate haven, with captives doing main force. No, you don't control fleet when they are out on the mission. They all came out in 2001-2003, used engine of Railroad Tycoon 2 and made by PopTop.Now, technical side, how do these old games work now. Well, none support widescreen, as you guessed.I had almost no trouble with Tropico 1. It just ran in full-screen in Software mode by default. It refused to switch to Hardware mode. The only shame is that because of that Steam overlay was not working.Tropico 2 gave much more resistance, being filthy pirate and all. It would crash when it loaded any level. I had to go to game's folder, open Tropico2.ini file and enable ""SoftwareDevice"". After that, it still was unfriendly, as not only Steam overlay did not work, but Alt-Tab would cause annoying graphical bugs in game's interface.Tropico 1 should be familiar to you if you played T3 or T4. You are Dictator who controls small island. The game is noted for combining SimCity with micromanagement elements. This game is much smaller scale of having around 100 persons in a town. As results it simulates every person indicidually, much less abstract than in SimCity. They got needs, wants, they need to travel distances to work, or wander around for enternainment. And yea, thus you get to get more personal. Ordering to take out individual person. Or having pain of making sure that they live nearby work.And well, one of a flaw of a game is that it sometimes requires you to micromanage some stuff that you don't have good tools for. What I am mostly talking about is making sure that person lives in the best house, that is closest to work. The only thing you can do is firing person from work or such and that puts them into bad mood. Heck, one of the way you can fail in this game is by overextending. Most often you will end up taking only 1/3 of the island, otherwise you tend to drop into negative balance. The only thing that building road do is to make it easier to go up the hill.You can order people to build, you can make edits or you can tweak wages and options of each building. You have to make your town work. Also, it's a very slow paced game. And it shows, like constructing can be a pain there. First workers will have to clean the land of shacks/trees by destroying them, then clean rubble, then they have to work on ground to put it into same level and only then they will start to actually build. Airport can end up being less worth than the time it takes, for example. Still enjoyable to watch people work.You also have many political sides to satisfy. You can either build economy on tourists or industy. And you can be either more people-caring dictator or a forceful evil one with military might. It's fun as it's not so single-pathed. Though to be honest, it leans more toward satisfying needs of religious people, easier and more beneficial to appeal toward Soviets, tourists don't give much of strong economy and it's better to be more democratical than actually use edits for evil.Pretty nice game, though I wish it made us use more dictatorship tools. And a bit clunky nowdays.Tropico 2 is more pirate-themed though. It's quite unique, but it's also less fun somehow. You got two kind of people who do their own jobs and must be kept in separate zones of comfort. Captives work on industry and require fear and order. Pirates just satisfy their needs on lands and work on the ships, they need zones of defence and anarchy. And sadly pirate job is handled on a map and is mostly a game of chance where you can get screwed up. If you do screw up, well, you may not get out if you run out of gold. Though main recource there is lumber for buildings.It's more linear game too. Some buildings produce certain recources for other buildings, all to satisfy pirates. You need industry from captives, you build ships, you send them and hope for the best. Every building needs to be made near road. Edics feel more like general orders. And you just need to keep happyness above middle, it doesn't feel as much of motivating to grow as in Tropico 1.On good side, stats book was improved, letting you choose and control much easier. And to analyze.It also got a campaign, though it still feels like just series of separate islands one after another. Still nice.It doesn't really feel exciting for me for some reason. Kinda more one-lined. But some will love it. Makes a good bonus with Tropico 1.Oh, and important thing to note: both Tropico games have simple yet catchy music. T1 has tons of them! There.

Damned, as a child I played this one and good ol' Anno 1602 for more than 500 hours each! If you like developement games and have a thing for retro gaming, go pick this one up!

												This is just too funny. Is comedy and is tragedy and very close to reality. Pretty much a game for mature people with a little grasp on history and the world headliners. Everybody can enjoy the strategy and the humor the game provides, but takes a little knowledge and, lets say, life experience to truly enjoy the experience of running your very own banana island and the highs and lows of being a two-bit dictator. Good value for the buck. The game provides many hours of playing time. No bugs. No crashes. Awesome music. Decent graphics.Yeah, you play a game and you try to defeat the game, but here doesn't really matter if you end up as the corrupt winner or getting kicked out from power with no ceremony and running for your life... at the end everybody loses with a goverment like yours. And you always get a laugh out of it.			",47,23,0,21,5,0,31

												A charming and addictive city-simulator that shrinks the scale of your city in exchange for greater management over your people. This game is brimming with personality and while it's got a bit of a learning curve (as most games in the genre do), the game doesn't punish you for your mistakes. I have yet to play the later entries for comparison, but this is a fine game in its own right.			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

												I think to some extent you have to have some kind of emotional attachment to really enjoy older titles, and tropico reloded is a good example of this in action. I cannot for the life of me get into Tropico, and that is a shame. There is nothing wrong with either of them, and one can argue that compared to the newer iterations the first tropico contains just as much, if not more depth to its mechanics. There are more of everything. More edicts, more graphs, information I'd really had liked playing Tropico 4 laying in the open.. And i still can't get into it. Mostly it is due to the clunkyness, newer games will spoil you like that .)However, for what it is, and for what it should be expected to be when going into it, the first tropico really acts and feels like the later games, so much in fact that the later games feel kinda lazy for ripping so much of the old content rigth of. And for this it should be respected. If you want to experience the genesis of the series then get this, but be prepared that even if it is the same old Tropico you love and like, the keyword here is old. :)However, that says nothing for the second game of the pack, Tropico 2: pirate cove!It is completely different from all others of the series, not only due to its pirate themes, but due to significant changes to gameplay as well. Instead of factions such as nationalists and environmentalists the island populace is now divided into enslaved workers and pirate overlords (Note that some subgroups such as hedonists and gentry exist among the pirates, but it is very much streamlined between the groups).Trade is marginalized in favour of raiding and rather than creating a self-sufficient island you now need to focus on getting piratically powerfull enough to take what you need through raids and buccaneering. It is a fresh and different playstyle compared to the other tropicos and making your island run effectively, juggling worker repression and pirate happiness is very different from the teasing and pleasing of different political factions and building effectively now has an element of demography to it as well since pirates enjoy anarchic environments and abhore order, while workers on the other hand need orderly environments to work effectively and escape easier when anarchy is high. It is great, and in itself a very solid strategy game. Also, good pirate-themed games are rare, so giving it a spin just for that is justified.As you can see, my view of these games differ quite a lot, and this brings me back to the first point of the text; that emotions can make or break the experience. I never played Tropico 1, it is old and clunky and i cannot appreciate it properly. I did on the other hand play Tropico 2 as a kid. It is old and clunky, and I love it.Thus: While I can reccomend Tropico reloaded for what it is, an old but iconic forerunner to a good franchise and a nice island management game with a pirate twist, i can only on a personal level recommend it for Tropico 2. Make of that what you will :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is perfect if you want to spend those few hours of free time you have left after you finished your studies or chores. That is, untill you get the hang of it... Then it turns into a time consuming all-encompassing simulator that will demand your very life essence until the day you decide to actually stop playing it and make up for all the time you have commited to Tropico.All in all it is a great game. Sure the graphics may be a bit old but this is a classic that will have you coming back over and over again replaying it and trying to find a new and ingenious way to be a dictator jackass or a saint in heels.

												One of my favorite games of all time, I come back to play the original Tropico every summer.  The sequels are great, but there is something about the original graphics and the awesome soundtrack that make it enjoyable even about a decade later.  From a perspective from someone who has held elected office, Tropico taught me a decent bit about the pitfalls of power and what to do/and what definitely not to do. Though it deals with the antiquated cold war ideals, I found that to be one of its strengths because it displayed just how horrible it probably was to be a member of the Third World and have the potentiality of a U.S. gunship landing on the shore.Anywho, great game.  Had it since it came out and haven't put it down even still.			",39,13,0,20,13,0,22

												I played alot of Tropico in the pre-steam era and absolutely loved it - so when it came up on sale with the expansion pack and Tropico 2 to boot I had to have it.Yes, it may have aged but it still retains that wonderful charm and tounge-in-cheek humour that made it such a joy to play. It is very easy to learn the basic mechanics of running your own banana republic, but it is incredibly hard to master. After years of playing I still haven't managed to complete some of the harder difficulty scenarios. The extra missions provided by the DLC pack provide a significant increase in scenarios available, and with the random map generator you can generate any scenario you might like. Be warned, its incredibly addictive.Also, the soundtrack is top notch. I believe it won several awards, and if it fails to get your feet tapping along to the latin rhythms then you have my sympathy. 10/10 would El Presidente again.			",21,4,0,9,15,0,13

												Tropico Reloaded is kind of a game where you act as a president of your nation (island).  You will instructing some of your people to build any of many kinds of farms,  power plants,  schools, police stations,  buildings that attract tourism and many more.   Essentially, Tropico is like city-building sim plus yourself as an acting president.   People can be happy or unhappy with how you manage the island.  For example, if your island is suffering high unemployment percentage, expect unhappiness to rise.   In Tropico, it is critical to maintain the happiness of your people because there will be elections every few years.  I have found this game to have a great replayability value.  The music also goes well with the game.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys city-building sim with yourself being the president working to ensure you win next election and stay in power.

												Tropico 1 (and its expansion, Paradise Island) holds a special place in my heart as one of the games in my childhood that drew me into city builders and management sims. If you've never played it, this game has lots of charm; buyer beware for those of you who are frustrated by retro graphics, or have played Tropico 3, 4, or 5 - you may find that the gameplay is a little dated.Tropico 2, on the other hand, has amazing replay value because nothing like it has tread on the same ground. A pirate themed city builder in which you have a ""negative"" economy based exclusively on kidnapping captives to produce supplies and send pirates out raiding trade convoys for plunder. While there are some frustrating ticks in this game (e.g. grumpy pirates who refuse to go spend their gold satisfying their needs), this is still a fun and unique experience. This title alone is nearly worth the price of the bundle!			",44,10,0,15,20,0,26

												Having never played Tropico before, but getting the series at a good price, I thought I'd give the older games a go to see how the series progressed over the years.Graphically, Tropico looks a lot like the older Roller Coaster Tycoon series. It's not beautiful by any means, but it's not without its charm either.Gameplay is pretty straight forward: you're the dictator of an island and you need to keep your people happy while balancing politics and economics. There isn't a lot of micromanagement like the Sim City games, and the entire experience feels pretty relaxed and entertaining.There isn't a huge diversity of buildings available, but there are enough to feel like the game has sufficient content. There are also various scenareos all featuring different maps, and if that's not enough, you can generate a random map to your own specifications.The only complaint I have against Tropico is that there are some resolution issues, and the information tab kept opening itself every few minutes. The tab may have been a local issue, or it may have been a glitch. Not game-breaking, but still annoying.All in all, Tropico is still a very playable game even today. That said, I don't know if it's worth investing your time and money unless you're nostalgic or looking to experience the series as it aged (like I was). I only say this because the newer games in the series have all received mostly positive reviews, and there really isn't any reason to take two steps back unless its an experience you're exclusively looking for.To all the citizens of Tropico I failed: lo siento, mi amigos - no soy un buen dictador.

												Definitely has a sense of humor and scratches the management itch.  Some of the ""control"" is a little touchy--relocating to new homes or changing jobs may take a couple tries of evicting/firing, for example.  But it's also just fun to watch your little citizens go about their lives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still playable after so many years. Very easy to notice certain flaws with the gameplay that make it rather tedious at times, especially since it was the precursor to many similar titles that have built on top of its core aspects. Tropico Reloaded is still a great game and should be admired and played (if you already haven't) for the simple reason that it inspired so many with so little.			",16,4,0,1,6,0,4

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANAEnglish:There isn't much to say, it's simply amazing. If you like management simulation games, you have to buy it. If you have never played management simulation games, you have to buy it. It's a well done classic, funny and with simple mechanics, and you are the ♥♥♥♥ing Castro at Cuba! 10/10, absolutely. (Sorry for my bad english.) Italiano:C'è poco da dire, è semplicemente una figata. Se ti piacciono i giochi gestionali, devi comprarlo. Se non hai mai giocato ad un gioco gestionale, devi comprarlo. E' un classico ben fatto, divertente e dalle meccaniche semplici, e poi sei praticamente il fottutissimo Castro a Cuba! 10/10, assolutamente.			",256,136,0,45,18,0,36

												The package is worth it for Tropico alone. A fun, challenging, and charming sim. The game is full of surprises even hours into gameplay. The fact that Tropico 2 comes with it is a fantastic bonus. I bought it on sale, but had I known it'd be this fantastic I would've gladly paid full price. Thanks, Kalypso!Tropico 2 on the other hand, while keeping the fun and charm, alters the difficulty curve in a strange way. Haulers have a tendency to durdle or even take things to the wrong locations, and no matter how much corn you grow and how many chuck tents you build, once workers start dying off it's a steep slope. I wouldn't buy it on its own merit, but the fact that it's packaged with a vastly superior game makes it worth at least a look.			",93,14,4,4,12,1,14

												Huge replayability, and I especially enjoyed the music of the Pirate Cove. I think Tropico 2 added a lot of features that keeps the game interesting, and more variables so that even playing as the same dictator, you don't get the same game twice. I do think that It's  not as easy to make a reputation for yourself as a dictator in the later games as it is in the first.. but this might also be because of their increasing complexity...

												I was introduced to this game back when it first came out through my deadbeat stepfather who was into games like this...  I played it a little back then, but was frustrated and resumed playing Civ games.Recently picked it up during a sale and got into it hard. Admittedly these sorts of games sometimes feel like an escapist narcotic... hours go by unnoticed, flashes of euphoria staring at the screen.  And there's a sense of realism too since all of the little Tropicans have their own ""personality"" and there's very little hand-holding strategy written on the web (which led me to figure out a lot by myself...Got my wisdom teeth pulled out... spent day 1 at home.  Fired up Tropico and kept saying things out loud like ""Damn!  They want another election!"" and ""Hmm, it seems like I'm going to have switch my tobacco export to papaya or something..""  Eventually, my girlfriend took notice and before I knew it we were co-ruling my little Tropican dystopia.After we lost an election, she forced me to start a new map and we began again.  This time she was in charge and I watched in awe as she beautifully laid out the map and started making money right away from a meticulously designed factory sector.  A couple hours in, she went for a shower and I took over.  Feeling confident, I got the electrical plant operational and started building condos.  The election was surely in our favor but I gave everyone a tax cut and thew a big Mardi Gras party just in case.""Hey babe, how's the city doing?""Humiliated, we were voted out.  She was very upset with me.  Not sure if I can recommend this for couples... it gets real.Oh, and the reason we lost (theoretically) was because our factories were blowing all their pollution into the ""nice"" part of town... watch out for that.  :( ",0,2,0,2,3,0,5

												Since this package includes both Tropico and Tropico 2, I've chosen to review each individually. Spoiler alert: They haven't aged well.TropicoThe original Tropico came to us during one of the peaks of the city-building genre, right in between Simcity 3000 and 4. You play the dictator of a Caribbean banana republic in the height of the Cold War, building industries and services, issuing edicts, and managing your people as you see fit. It's a more personal game, with every one of your citizens simulated with their own schedules and desires and opinions. Tropico was undeniably ahead of its time and its reception suffered a bit for that. With the benefit of a decade plus of refinement on the formula, however, its flaws are sadly clearer than ever.Every scenario in Tropico starts you off on an island with the most basic provisions of society, such as farms, shacks, a port, and a palace for your unseen dictator. From there you build farms to feed your people, industries to export goods, housing to get your people out of shacks, and all manner of services from clinics to churches to schools. Each of your citizens has nearly a dozen factors that influence their happiness, and success means keeping these as high as possible. Your control over policy is incredibly granular, allowing you to set wages and management styles at businesses, influence immigration rates, add upgrades to factories. This is to say nothing of the dozens of edicts you can issue, and random events that can have huge effects on your island.It's an incredibly promising formula that sadly was not fully realized in its first iteration. The chief offender is the citizen simulation, which proved to be more limiting than anything. Your people have to get to work, get something to eat, find some way to unwind, and get home, with each of those steps having a real-time effect on your economy. That means your island can easily go bankrupt if your dockworkers take too long loading ships, or your teamsters get distracted from carting cigars to market. There are bugs in the staffing system as well... I had my clinics and hospitals completely unmanned for decades despite having dozens of qualified workers at lower-paying jobs.The rest of the systems are similarly half-baked. Your edicts can provide food for the people, prohibit alcohol, change relations with the US or USSR, and disappear some of your problematic citizens. But many of them have very marginal or even detrimental net effects. Relations with the superpowers are difficult to manage in any meaningful way with your limited diplomacy tools. The whole Swiss bank system is also more trouble than it's worth, because the main way to funnel money into your account is to make all your buildings 20% more expensive, which just makes playing the game harder. A large number of buildings and edicts happen to be locked behind providing electricity to your island as well, which is ludicrously expensive and rarely necessary to complete scenarios in the first place.The whole thing is built on the old, voxelly Railroad Tycoon II engine which gives it a quaint, photo-scanned look but makes it incredibly hard to see elevations as they lie. This will cause you plenty of headaches when trying to build buildings anywhere near each other as you builders have to flatten terrain completely to build. The sound design is solid and contributes to the peppy, kitschy feel of the game, but does clash with the dry look of it. There's no campaign, just sandbox and scenarios that give you basic goals to shoot for over 50 years.The series has come a long way since the original, which only makes it harder to accept this entry's flaws. Everything there is to appreciate about Tropico has been done better from 3 and on, with nothing left to tickle your nostalgia. I was looking forward to revisiting this title after bouncing off it in my youth, but it proved just as frustrating now as it did then.Tropico 2: Pirate CoveIt comes as no surprise that Tropico 2 is the black sheep of the series. The only one to break from the banana republic formula, Pirate Cove has you as a pirate king, ruling over an island of buccaneers and captive laborers. It's a novel concept, and I can't be the only gamer who's dreamed of building their own Tortuga, rife with brawling and wenching. And so it was that I came to Tropico 2 with high hopes, and left with them dashed against the rocks.There are more than a few notable changes from the original Tropico in this installment. As mentioned, you have two separate populations to manage, pirates and captives. Pirates man your ships and keep your island safe, while captives provide all the labor and services pirates need to stay happy. You'll need to shower your sea dogs with booze, wenches, and cards to keep them satisfied, whereas captives must be kept fearful and complacent to minimize the risk of escape. It's an interesting dynamic that mostly works, though a few of your tools for maintaining the nebulous Order and Anarchy figures are things like skull topiaries and cartoonish piles of bones, belonging more in Rollercoaster Tycoon than this title.Mechanically, the game is even more distant from its predecessor. Almost all buildings are locked to roads and cost no money to build, instead requiring lumber chopped from camps and milled into planks. There's a greater emphasis on supply chains as well, with individual units of corn going from farm to brewery, being brewed into grog, then going from brewery to tavern. Every building has its own hauler in addition to the usual workers, and some have overseers which are usually unoccupied pirates. Much of your production will be in rations and weapons for your ships, which you order out on plundering or kidnapping missions to score gold, captives, and resources on a strategic map.All of this makes a pretty good setup for a management game, and indeed the first few missions of the robust campaign roll along with promise. The moment you hit the fourth mission, however, the whole thing comes apart. Once you are charged with maintaining the happiness of your pirates and complacency of your captives, you discover just how little control you have over them and how fragile it is. You cannot assign captives to specific jobs, so a little thing like having no hauler for your tavern means it never gets grog, meaning none of your pirates can drink, meaning you're about to have a mutiny on your hands. Same problem if you can't keep enough female captives for your farms and brothels, or even workmen at your lumber camps.There are simply too many random elements to make the game reliably fun, even in the campaign. In my first attempt at one mission, based around kidnapping key workers, my ship was randomly sunk which forced a restart. On the next attempt I had no extra male captives to man the lumber yard, which meant I couldn't do anything for the first year of a five-year mission. And despite the excellent tutorials and advisor, there are some incredibly poor design decisions. In the first mission where you must manage pirate happiness, you're locked from building them any sort of residence, a key happiness indicator. The whole thing smacks of decent concepts taken to faulty conclusions.The graphics share the crisp sprite charm of the original, but the pirate motif is far more forced in the stylings and will start to grate once frustration at the mechanics sets in. As much as I like the concept, it's ultimately a game about the most boring part of piracy, and abstracts all the good bits behind charts and text pop-ups. I still think it's possible to get a good game out of managing an island of degenerates, but this certainly isn't it.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Tropico is an oldie but a goodie if you're interested in strategy, citybuilding and/or politics. You're the dictator of a Latin American banana republic during the Cold War, one that's small enough that you order the placement of every individual building. You must balance the needs and wants of your citizenry with your own goals, whatever they may be, and other political factors if they appear. Depending on the conditions you set, your tenure can be anywhere from a sleepily relaxing downtime - the sort you play between other games - to an extremely violent white-knuckle challenge.No matter your preference, the game is tinged with black comedy, as befitting a game where you basically play as Tiny Cuba and lose whenever ousted from power. The Tropico Reloaded pack you buy this in also contains Tropico's only expansion, Paradise Island, as well as Tropico 2, a less-than-stellar pirate-based sequel. I would at least recommend the first Tropico for strategy buffs interested in a novel offshoot of the genre, and retro fans who liked Tropico 3/4 (which were essentially progressively additive remakes of this game anyway).Tropico was released in 2001 by my favorite defunct strategy developer, PopTop Studios. You might know that the series was picked up later by Haemimont Games and turned into a veritable franchise. Don't let the charming Y2K-era graphics fool you here: Tropico may be the most laid-back game in the series, but it's also the hardest in the series. You don't get quick construction, or a raft of DLC buildings to supercharge your economy, or paved roads for that matter.In fact, the most difficult aspect is arguably construction workers needing to manually clear and level the terrain for everything you build. This means you'll need to do some logistical planning before you want that airport built, and the sooner the better. The increased difficulty is mitigated by the fact that you can still choose what traits your Presidente has, the political and physical climate of the island, and how often random events happen.The 60-odd included scenarios, like the game itself, range from pretty easy to almost stupidly hard. If the base game starts to wear thin for you, you'll probably like the challenges they have to offer. You don't get to choose your Presidente's stats or island conditions for a scenario, though, and they will often force your ruling hand whether you like it or not.If there's anything to criticize, it's that the UI is somewhat dated, at least by the standards of Haemimont's sequels. It's more or less lifted from PopTop's earlier title Railroad Tycoon II, where it shared the same characteristic of being a somewhat archaic interface in a classic genre game. Tropico also has a slower pace than its modern sequels, but that's not a big deal if you're patient.The biggest flaw in the whole series (and something I'm told Tropico 5 remedies, although I still need to play it) is that if you just focus on profitable industry early on, providing everything else you need and that your citizens want becomes much, much easier once the money starts rolling in. The solution here is to increase the challenge for yourself, whether by playing a scenario or generating a barren rock of an island.In theory, the feeling you get from balancing all the national concerns would make up for that problem, but that's still kind of predicated on making mistakes every so often and dealing with the consequences. Every choice here has a consequence, big or small, whether you know it or not - and on a related tangent I would say Tropico is perhaps the most sim-like of the series. My advice is to try roleplaying if you need an extra challenge and haven't been doing so already; one of the other strengths of the series in my opinion is the dynamic between a player's ideals (or designs) and the gameplay reality they have to deal with.At least Tropico's Latin soundtrack is just really, really nice. It's certainly the most bucolic and varied in the series. Best part is, it's still for[www.amazon.com] sale[www.amazon.com]. It even makes military coups seem...well, okay, not as stressful.A bit of advice for new Presidentes. Citizens put satisfaction of needs above work in terms of importance in every Tropico game, but here it's especially important to make sure you build with that in mind. Also, don't be afraid to play nasty if you're about to be kicked out while still learning the ropes.The included Gold Edition manual promises a number of goodies, but you don't get any in the Steam download. I'll give you some instead. You can read a series of development columns for the game here[web.archive.org] download the making-of movie here, the old BradyGames strategy guide here[www.replacementdocs.com], a copy of every single official and usermade scenario here[steamcommunity.com] (thanks to Steam user Reformed Pirate), and you can view another bonus movie on YouTube here.Review of Tropico 2 forthcoming.

												In my opinion, I think this game is one of the most important games when it comes to RTS games. I say this because this game has three fantastic components: music, design and gameplay. The concept of the game is unique and it becomes addicting - if you start the game, you are going to have to finish it. This is the kind of game that proves that video games are a mixture of art and science. One of the best and certainly a case study for future game developers.			",62,3,4,5,10,2,6

												Back when this series came out, back in like 2001, I played the original Tropico, and something about the gameplay made me into a tyrannical dictator in RL. So, at the time, I deleted it, and always thought of how angry it made me.Fourscore years into the future, out of sheer curiosity, I started researching whether the game could be found on the net, so I could play. At first, I thought I was going to find it under DOS-Box, and have to run a Win 98 emulator, etc. but Steam has purchased it, so it runs on my Win 8.1 and Win 7 platforms, without issue. Thank you to them for that.As far as gameplay goes, this is about as good as PC games ever were. No silly ads to deal with. No DLC to muck up gameplay. It runs fast and clean, and you don't have to buy any u/g to move through the campaign and beat the game. The good thing about this pack, is you get the original game, and Tropico 2: Pirate's Cove, for the low price of $6.99. Old cheat codes work, and I am sure if that isn't enough, the 'Extras' menu allowing you to edit built-in scenarios, as well as build your own scenarios, is gonna keep you busy.I think the only thing I've got to say negative, and it's probably the design of the game, is I never get attacked at my base by the other nations. I hardly can get them mad enough, I guess, although, after attacking them mercilously for years on end in the game, they amass enormous fleets that pretty much desimate any ships I send to the busy regions. I would like to actually have to defend myself.If you like older games, and loathe the way newer games are chock full of DLC and ads and freemium crap, then get this game and refresh your cache!

												The original Tropico game, which I remember first playing on my computer like 10 years ago or more. Tropico is a city-builder game based on a tropical island, loosely based around Cuba and places like that. You have just become the El Presidente and must make this Island the best. It's a great game, lots to do and customise. I remember when I was younger struggling to play this game without using the money cheat code, and having a quick play on here assures me that the game is still a little challenging I feel, for a more average player. But I'm sure that veterans of the city builder genre will find it okay, and who knows, maybe I just suck at this game. (Btw, I tested, the cheat still works in this version which is great ;) )			",83,41,0,22,8,0,15

Don't get me wrong there are some thing I wish could be added from the newer games but those just don't feel like Tropico.

												Great game. It's a bit harder than the newer Tropico games. As the first installment of the series, it's a bit rough around the edges, but it still has that good ol' Tropico humor. I just played this game for the first time as an adult in 2017, so I have no nostalgia or childhood memories of it, but it was still enjoyable. If you are new to the Tropico series, it is NOT necessary to start with this game. You can probably start with whatever is the newest one at the time of reading this. But my personal favorite is Tropico 3!Anyway, in Tropico 1, pay extra close attention to your city's logistics because the citizens' AI seems to be extra dumb (or, extra stubborn and I couldn't deal with it). Cars don't exist in this game, so make sure everything a person needs to get to is within walking distance. The camera is very basic and makes it hard to see certain things, but that is to be expected with a game of this age. If you happen to play on a custom generated map, I'd set the options to a flatter landscape. Building on hills and mountains was a pain.I played this on my 2011 laptop with Windows 7 and it ran perfectly fine for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game of my childhood <3. And surprisingly, it has aged pretty well. Of course if you consider the fact, that there are two other titles (yeah, I'm excluding Pirate Cove...), which have better graphic, mechanics and all of that, in theory there's really no reason to go back to this one other than sentiment. Game works well with Windows 7, which is really good, since even some of the newer games (""Fallout 3""... Khem, khem...) often have problems with that. There are few graphic glitches, but nothing major. And few bugs. A little more major. Pros:+ well aged game + music+ our lovely adviser <3 + humor+ many missions with different difficulty levels (some of them are really easy, some of are truly challenging)+ cynicism of those who have power (reality 10/10).Cons:- bugs - unfortunately some of them make your mission impossible or at least much harder to win - you're workers for some reasons, suddenly, just can go to some place and before you realize that, you already have a few building around this part, etc.			",317,274,13,107,56,3,42

												Tropico is an awesome, quirky series. I remember playing these on the old systems for hours. I decided to bring back some childhood classics, Tropico being one of them. However, there's massive issues running Tropico I and II on a Windows 10 system. It does not play well, often bogging down or crashing. The games simply won't give you a satisfying experience when running on a Win10 system. It's unfortunate. Would I recommend this game? Of course! Just be weary of issues when trying to play it on a newer system.			",8,2,2,4,16,0,9

												I have a glowing review for Tropico 4, okay, maybe it was written in 1 minute flat and took very little effort, but I really do like the Tropico Games.  I am not sure how much of a market there is for this older title.  The overall game play has been preserved throughout the Tropico series, but the newer titles have so much more to do and the visuals are vastly improved.  Even though I have 22 hours of loving gameplay on Tropico, I think its best to go with Tropico 4.  That being said, I still give this game a thumbs up because it is fun even today.

												This game is great for beginners to city builder style games. The UI is easy to navigate and understand and nothing seems overly complicated. For it's age, it looks great. The music is awesome and fits the Carribean style setting. Who'd have thought becoming a dictator of a small island nation could be so fun?			",147,28,5,34,33,1,12

												Its a good game alright, however unless you feel any kind of nostalgia for it, you would be better off buying Tropico 4.One thing I noticed was how much easier it was to make money in this game compared to other Tropico games. I was able to buy a cathederal, army base, and many apartments very early in the game just because I had a few farms....The Pirate Cove expansion/sequel is nowhere near as good but its worth a look.

												The first time I was introduced to this game was in my 11th grade Social Studies class by my teacher. He used it as a way to show the conflict in the 1950s with the world Superpowers but also how a nation would go from a third world country into a first world country. Of course, our class failed and the citizens overthrew us but it always stuck in my mind how fun and innovative the game was. Now, 9 years later, I picked it up along with its sequels and was not disappointed. It is just as fun as it was back then and I happily take to the island for some good old strategy. And to be a dictator, of course.I do recommend checking some guides with this game to see if you would enjoy it. The newer games seem to have ironed out many of the kinks the old one suffers from but it is still enjoyable though sometimes stressful. I would probably recommend this game to those who would like to see how far Tropico has come or to anyone who is, like me, a history nerd.			",96,31,0,15,20,0,13

												This is a classic! There are a lot of different scenarios but for me the best is the local sandbox games. There is a lot of little things that make this game great. It can be a challenge but very rewarding. There is something fun about determing what type of leader you are going to be this time around. You can be purely a democratic island and try to gain support from each faction or you can be a ruthless dictator that has the military on their side. The soundtrack is also great and you will never get tired listening to the beautiful music. I highly recommend this game!			",12,4,0,3,9,0,5

While this game may feel a bit unpolished, it is still one of my favorite games of all time and is actually more challenging than Tropico 4 due to a variety of environmental and trade aspects.

												As of July 2015 Tropico Reloaded is still my favourite of the Tropico family of games.  Sure it doesn't have the graphics of some of the later games but the sandbox is great and you have a lot of flexibility to run your island as you see fit.  For instance, you aren't blockaded just because you decide not to be a puppet for the US,  I owned this game since it originally came out and now have the Steam version.  So if you want to run your island as you see fit, sit down and enjoy for hours to come, as you adapt your style to the geography of the island.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So i was playing SimCity today, but instead of being a president that has to make it's citizens happy... I was a dictator that used his military power to keep everyone at bay, and took all the profit from businesses and put it in switzerland where it would be safe. Russia really liked me, but everyone kept complaining on how they were starving... I wasn't starving though, nor complaining... My palace, with everyone living in shacks. The Tourists come and go gambling at the casino, which is too expensive even for my common citizens. But my guards, they love the casinos...  They go to them all the time... That's why a riot was able take over and destroy my paradise.. R.I.P. My Beautiful Paradise. But seriously, Tropico is the SimCity mixed in with dictatorship, you're an island's dictator, you control everything on what you wish it to be. Tropico is x50 better than SimCity and tbh it deserves a.......20/10 for being an extremely fun game.			",325,98,3,41,35,4,40

												Writing this review in 2016 should explain how much I actually love this game, but if this wasn't enough let me tell you... There's something that exceeds all the visuals, planning, gameplay and even what the reviews may tell you about a game and it's the warmth. Though it's clearly a city (well, island) sim and somewhat economically oriented (yeah, the REAL goal in the game is to become filthy rich at expense of your population), it's the political angle that gives this game a huge edge bar none other sim. Maybe it's its spanglish (WELCOME EL PRESIDENTE!), maybe it's how you can get lost peeping in every person in your island's beliefs and life, but it most certainly could be its music. My God, I truly believe no one gave Daniel Indart the credit he deserved for such a sweet ost. And I don't mean only in the game climate's sake, but even to hear it on the street and at the office. I tend to carry around a copy of it everywhere I go just to play it once in a while. Believe me, EVERYONE asks where it's from (some even think it's Gloria Estefan's or Juan Luis Guerra's).Well, maybe this review (my first, please be gentle) isn't really telling you anything about the gameplay and it's challenges, and you know what? It never intended to, because the real replayabilty of this game (which I believe stands very well the test of time) is pretty much bond to the feelings the whole experience reminds you of. In my case, teen times, but nonetheless you will immerse yourself in an experience closer to nurturing and debating with your own population rather than imposing your thoughts and finding the shortcut to victory.

												This game is a classic! You play a individually created south American dictator and rule an island. Your goal is to turn your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into a big city and deal with economics and demographic problems. Politics also do play a big part of the game. If you love statistics with complex gameplay surrounded by Caribbean music and atmosphere in general, you've come to the right place! It also aged pretty well, since it's a 2D game.

												My girlfriend made half a million just from one of her coffee farms.Verdict: 7/10, 9/10 with rice.Seriously though, this is an easy to play but hard to master sim game with a unique dictatorial flavor. Play random islands with custom rules to master bringing happiness to the people, or play premade scenarios of varying difficulty to challenge yourself. If that sounds fun, you can't go wrong with Tropico. If it looks too dated for you, pick up one of the later entries in the series.			",209,171,2,32,8,2,3

												The game is great for city building and I love the implementation of the way the game uses public intervententions to change the way the game is played. However this is not a game to buy if you are interested in city building games since Tropico lacks detail, balance and content in comparison to other games of the same type.ANNO 2205 came out a few weeks ago and I would highly recommend buying any ANNO game.

												I created a country full of only uneducated citizens. The intellectuals demanded a high school.I created a country full of only farmers and builders. The capitalists demanded better diversity in jobs.I increased the size of the army and the policeman. The militarists overthrew me.11/10 Best demographics simulator ever.It’s actually a really fun game to play for a couple of hours.

To finally get how it works can either be very satisfying or very frustrating depending on your tastes. I have fun with this game until I notice I essentially suck at running a country because I don't just can't seem to understand the approrpiate salary/fee/rant scale for each building, especially at the start.

												Honestly, I love this game. You build up your own specialized economy on farming, or tourism mainly, while managing your island. You strive to remain in power and stay in good relations with America and your Russian comrades. You make political decisions and decrees to make the people happy or terrified. You will also work hard to cater to every need of the people. Or just enslave them and gun the rebels down... Have Fun!			",91,18,0,13,16,0,11

												Tropico, Tropico never changes.1 seems to be pretty much the same as 3 and essentially what 4 is. 3 is the best Tropico game I have played thus far but I like this one. The major changes is aesthetics it seems like to me and better streamlining and controls in later games but still they are for intents and purposes they are the same games.That said I still like and enjoyed this for what it is. But if you just want a great Tropico game just get 3. 4 added some Sim City aspects I hated and was a step backwards even from the default Tropico formula. 4 also lacked a likable announcer, 3s Juanito was comedic and really made the game had atmosphere.

												I bought this game for Tropico 2: Pirates Cove and to try Tropico 3. If you can get past the fact that Tropico 2 is really dated and you can tell badly when you play, then get it. It is a good game similar to Sim City without all the extra worries of subways, electrics and such. If you are buying it becuase you have Tropico 4, and want to try Tropico 3, don't, they are the same game just different music and different UI, otherwise buildings, narator, and everything else is the same as Tropico 4.

Really fitting to the game.Game Mechanics: [9/10]Have to say, the game mechanics were awesome, really well done (especially for the age of the game)Overall Score:[8.6/10]I really liked this game, the strategy is there, and it's humorous! I also played for 6 hours straight on the first start-up. Can't wait to try the next 4 in the series!Would recommend buying this game, even at full price. It's worth the $6.99 + more!

Tropico 1 - RecommendedCold War era Caribbean island-country simulator with its since-classic humour and charm.The game features a detailed and realistic population and politics system and good graphics for its age.The music is atmospheric and very catchy (it stuck in my head for 13 years after I first played the game in my childhood!). The English narrator has a bit exaggerated performance, but it's otherwise fitting to the game.The game is quite difficult by today's standards - even on very easy modes if I want my population to be happy, it wrecks my economy :DThere are weird gender restrictions on some of the jobs, eg. bureaucrats, engineers, teachers and waiters can only be women, while soldiers, police officers and professors can only be men.Overall I recommend this game if you want to see the classic roots of the Tropico series or just want to try a difficult country-building & politics simulator.Tropico 2 - Not RecommendedThe game is crashing a lot on Windows 7 x64, basically unplayable.But even when it worked before crashing it was kinda a horrible experience. I didn't quite think about what a pirate simulator would entail, but this game is basically a slavery simulator. Most of the people you rule are slaves, and you have to keep them constantly oppressed and terrified to stop them from fleeing or rising up against you. Most of the economy are run by these slaves - as far as I see you can't build an island only with free pirates. To make it worse the (always female) prost!tutes in the game are also slaves - which evokes the still existing parallel of sex trafficking.The game also has some other gender stereotypes going on, like male pirates have a ""wenching"" need bar (ew), while female pirates have a ""preening"" bar. (Apparently women don't have sex drives and men don't mind living in filth.) Both these needs can be satisfied at the same place, by female slaves. Also I can kinda understand why lumberjacks can only be men, but why can cooks only be women? O.oOn the technical side - the game mostly has the same graphics as Tropico 1, the music is a lot less catchy and the UI feels less intuitive too.So yeah, pass this game on, unless you don't mind oppressing and exploiting innocent captives, with added sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												Because of how little has changed in the Tropico series over the years, the first game in this bundle (Tropico 1) is essentially exactly the same as the newer releases, except with worse graphics. It has much more depth than Tropico 5 does, but then again, what doesn't? The second game (Tropico 2) is Tropico with a Pirate spin on it. However you need to install an aditional program to play it so I just passed on that one. I do recommend it if it's on sale. Otherwise 7$/€ is just a bit too much.  ",35,8,0,15,11,0,9

												Tropico Review (Reloaded) - Raymond KTSummary: You are the sole ruler of a remote banana republic. Fight against poverty, corruption and rebels, make your own people happy or enforce your rule through military strength. However, do not forget to set aside a few dollars for your own retirement on a swiss bank account!Most games of Tropico start with a few people scratching out a living on a small Caribbean island. You step in as their new presidente, with the background of your choice to give you a set of game-twisting traits. For instance, if you come from a moneyed background, you'll have an advantage in industry. If you're a radical student, the communists will be predisposed to support you. If you're Lou Bega--this is actually one of your starting options--you'll wow them with your nightclub acts.Armed with your distinctive set of traits and your new bank account, you drop buildings onto the island: housing, farms, cattle ranches, churches, medical clinics, pubs, police stations, bauxite mines, fishing wharves, and cigar factories. Later on, there are power plants, casinos, cathedrals, and TV stations. And there are always the little landscaping touches, such as flower beds, trees, fountains, and the occasional statue to remind everyone who's in charge. Tropico is dazzling and can also be a little confusing in the breadth of things you can build.Similarly, you can choose from a wide array of edicts, which are like the ordinances in SimCity 3000 or like spells in a fantasy-themed strategy game. You can arrest someone and bribe him or her, burn books to appease the church and keep the intellectuals in line, or make overtures to the United States for foreign aid. It's entirely possible to play without using the edicts, but they offer a touch of direct interaction for hands-on players. Similarly, you can influence most individual buildings if you're so inclined--you can set salaries, raise rents, or decide what your state-run TV station will broadcast.All the information available in Tropico about your economy, your citizens, and your society as a whole is a welcome change from games that insist on running things under the hood. The thorough documentation leaves very few questions unanswered. When you hold the mouse over a piece of information, an excellent in-game help system spells out how it relates to the game's mechanics. The numbers and graphs are all there at your fingertips, but they're not overbearing. Tropico is as complex as you want it to be.After an experiment as bold as Lionhead Studios' recent Black & White, Tropico is exactly what strategy gaming needs: a reminder that a game doesn't necessarily have to be weird, inscrutable, or unconventional to be great--it can get by on charm, broad appeal, and sophistication. Most everyone will find that Tropico is a real pleasure to play because of these qualities. - GameSpot ",107,29,6,13,24,1,11

												For someone who came from Tropico 4, this game's interface is difficult to use. If you played it back then on a Windows 98 computer, you probably have good memories. Otherwise, try a newer version of the game.			",113,53,7,22,31,1,35

												One of the best First Person shooters on Steam. In the dense Jungle of a South American dictatorship, it's you versus the violent locals. Use every weapon at your disposal to kill every person you see, or be killed. Epic music, and game play. And some of the most unorthodox weapons that keep you coming back for more.

												I reccommend this pack, but mostly just for Tropico 2, which is a cool game about pirates, and also kind of a unique entry in the series.Tropico 1 isn't so great, especially considering that Tropico 3 and Tropico 4 are basically much higher quality direct remakes of it. Tropico 1 is very rough and it hasn't aged well.			",303,113,2,80,50,5,71

												This is a classic city builder or rather a 3rd world simulator. It is very different than games like Sim City and Cities XL. Those two games are more macro city builders, where in two or three mouse clicks you can make city blocks where 1,000 people might live. With Tropico and the Tropico series in general, you need to place each building, each road and your island along with the time it takes your construction company to build it. Your entire island might get to be 200 - 500 'Tropicans.'Each Tropican has needs... Food, religion, job, healthcare, entertainment, safety and so on. The catch is every Tropican's needs have a certain weight to them based on what political party / faction they believe in. Each faction has major and minor demands. The military will want more soldiers, so you need to build an army base. The religious faction will want a church or cathedral. The capitalist party will want privatization or upscale entertainment. The communist party will want you to enable the free public housing edict or have etiquette healthcare.The real main objective in the game is to get re-elected. If you don't, its game over. So to get re-elected, you need to keep your Tropicans happy. You don't have to have elections even. You're in charge. If you don't want an election, you don't need to have them, but eventually your Tropicans will rebel against you and make it game over! You can see preliminary poll results and you can even sway (cheat) elections. Tropico 1 seems extremely difficult to win an election compared to later Tropico games. On top of that, you balance political relations with the USA and USSR. If they get too bad, one of the two will basically take over your country and it will be game over. It is interesting how many ways that you can get game over.When citizens hate you, and there will be plenty that do, they will either peacefully protest or become rebels. Once you have enough rebels against you, they will attack your most remote buildings. Your army will then go fight them, but if the rebels outnumber your army, the rebel will win and the buildings will be destroyed. The rebels can attack your palace or flat out assassinate you for a game over.Tropico has a lot of scenarios, but it is not a campaign and the game doesn't check off completed scenarios. Some scenarios last 30 minutes, others a few hours as you take an island from 1950 - 1990 or so. At the start of each scenario you can pick a player character from historical tropican dictators or make your own avatar. You can even make personality traits that will result in pros and cons. It can drastically change your play style if you are incorruptible and never have any crime or have a green thumb and have high farm yields at the cost of low factory production.The controls feel cumbersome compared to later Tropico games. You need to click something to open the building menu, then select the type of building, then click the rotate building button. Then plop the building down. Sure that's 4 clicks, but 4 clicks of specific areas and it could have been streamlined more maybe even with keyboard controls or having right mouse button or mouse wheel rotate the building as it does with later Tropico games.The game feels a lot slower than later versions of Tropico, such as making buildings, you'll need to wait for your builders to clear the land of shacks, demolish them, clean up the rubble, then clear the land of trees, then actually construct the building. Later versions of Tropico merely have it all instantly done, but tell you that it will take 20% longer.Another problem with Tropico 1 is there's not an easy way to tell what to do next. Sure every scenario has a major goal and clicking the almanac and looking through page after page can tell you statistical information and clicking every Tropican can show you their specific needs, but I never get an overall conscensus, your people want a church or whatever they need. Instead it feels like a 1 by 1 search basis. You can see an overall Tropican pay chart, but not a religious satasfaction chart. Even if the game tells you how many people believe in a religious faction or a military faction.With all of that in mind, I can't really recommend Tropico 1 compared to Tropicos 3, 4 or 5. However, Tropico 1 is still a classic for an old PC and there is still a lot of fun and enjoyment here. If it was the year 2002 I would recommend this game. Also there are several cheap bundles where you can buy the first 3 Tropicos for $5 or so.			",1128,324,52,104,96,15,167

												I played Tropico 3-4 and i have to say ,maybe the best city builder games out there (After Cities skylines) but i never played the beggining parts of Tropico.Since this is the 2 games in 1 edition of Tropico i can say that i didint like neither of them.The normal Tropico is OK for its time,the animantions,the sounds all of that is really great however its lacking in difficulty,crappy election thing,builders need a lot of time to start building a building,i also had a problem idk if that is actually a bug or a glitch or something the builders would start building the building that is has less priority first,and when that happends the building dissapears or also i had a prob hireing a proffesional to work in your country that you have to wait for him to arrive by boat,and that would just dissapear with no reason,no one would come over,and if i press to hire another expert, it shows me a greater bigger price that i have to pay,THATS ANOTHER BUG THERE,the school system is garbage It says build a high school! i build a high school! NOBODY IS VISITING IT TO STUDY,OK FINE i build a college so i would not pay foreigners to work,AND NOBODY IS VISITING IT,I BUILD AN ELECTRIC STATION AND I RISED WAGES ABOVE THE SKY AND NOBODY IS COMING,LIKE IT SAYS IN THE TUTORIAL ""''''If you raise the wages you will attract more people to work there''' F''''king BullS##t NONE OF THAT HAPPENDS,ITS SWARMING WITH BUGS IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON GETTING A TROPICO GAME GET A GAME STARTING FROM 3 ABOVE.I dont even want to mention the pirate one.

Tropico Reloaded???I clicked on Tropico 2 Pirate Cove in my games list. I hope they fixed it instead of just changing the name. It starts out being a cute game but I wouldn't bother.I doubt anyone played this game successfully for more than 10 minutes. The economy is for sh!t! Even with cheats it sucks. My pirates are lazy idiots. If Britain does show up, we're boned!Originally posted by me, based on my recurrent feelings about this game: ""Ah, Tropico! Because of you It's almost not painfully awful that I don't own SimCity."" UPDATE!Here is my overview of the Tropico series of games:TROPICO:Too good to uninstall (unless you need disk space);too bad to admit you've played it more than once. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is a great old classic, it's fun to play if it ran on newer computers properly, the game lags which makes the enjoyment of the game very sufferable. I would recommend anyone to get the game if it didn't have the lag.			",332,94,7,94,110,3,129

												You know it's an okay game, but after playing it for awhile (and with some crashing bugs), I've decided to give it the ol' stinker-roo. Don't get me wrong though, it was probably awesome as hell in the day, just kind of sucks now. Get's really boring later on in the leveling.			",28,25,0,5,11,0,4

												Tropico 2 is unplayable. The third mission in the campaign will inevitably end in a runtime error, and thanks to steam's ""pay for a game and maybe we'll let you play it"" policy, it can't be run in compatibilty mode. It takes a genius to ♥♥♥♥ something like that up! Why cant I just HAVE the game I paid real money for saved to my ♥♥♥♥ing hard drive?			",49,2,4,5,8,0,4

												I bought this game and discovered that enabling hardware graphics acceleration wrecks the game graphics. If you have (or are intending to upgrade to) a recent graphics card, everything may become garbled if you select this setting, although it probably won't crash. Software acceleration runs fine, but certain things like clouds and water will not look as good as when hardware acceleration is enabled. The game itself is probably good or bad. I haven't fully played it yet, so no comment.Note: Tested card is GeForce 560Ti.			",65,77,1,17,30,4,35

												I have once suckered myself into the Tropico franchise and this is one of Tropico's low points (but I will give it some slack due to not playing it as much and due to it being the first game). The game is OK at best, bad at worst with two game bundled into one (seems like a good deal right?) [Tropico & Tropico 2: Pirate Cove]. When I first got into them, the intro seemed promising with characters that I'd normally see in a Tropico game (excluding hookers, that was kinda a first) and the game begins with a cool, yet awkward title screen. It also was hard to move around, however, I've gotten through it. Eventually, I get to the scenario screen and I can choose a pre-created character. It's slightly dissappointing that I can only pick characters the programmers created and not create your own dictator of Tropico, however, it makes up for it by choosing to be either Fidel Castro or Che Guevara.Eventually, you load the game and you can create your nation. This is where it begins to fall apart, it feels kinda clunky and stiff. It still has the mechanics of Tropico, it just feels awkward coming from me. Anyways, my score for this game is a:6/10It's above average, it's ok and it would've been lower if they haven't had my favorite revolutionaries like Che or Castro.			",58,5,0,5,9,0,6

												i don't understand this game one bit.. i have it on ""sandbox"" to see what i need for true happiness of the people.. so, in what i think is a truely Fantasmal setup of a world, becomes a complete bust! i have wages on EVERYTHING at $50/m (maxed out), tons of luxury housing with ZERO RENT, tons of medicals, tons of entertainment at ZERO FEES, every industrial building made, and tons of electricity to power 100 stadiums (dramatic)!!! you would think the people would worship you with so much FREE housing, MASSIVE wages, and FREE entertainment!! that would be, my friends, a big fat NOOOOOOPE! not ONE person keeps thier job for more than a year, over 90% of the population is ""well-educated"" yet doesnt want to live in the FREE housing, and to top it all off, THE 'HAPPINESS' BAR GRUADUALLY DEMINISHES!!! WTF??! long story short (too late), waste of time. the people will NEVER, TRUELY, LOVE YOU. i keep hearing about how great Tropico 5 is, so i suggest going for that one (never tried it myself.. thier first title here, basicly ruined it for me.)

												They won't let me comment On Tropico3 unless I've played 5min. It crashes before the title screen so how am I able to play for 5 min so I will post here this applies to the whole Tropico2 and 3 bundle.  I managed to play a while on the T2 and pirate version but thats all that worked.Do not bother wasting the $6 on this bundle.Crash Crash Crash. That should be the name of this game. If watching a game crash over and over is your type of fun this is the game for you. You will have the greatest time ever. Never had a game so consistantly crash before it's even loaded better than this game does. On windows 7 pro and XP. I have a multi boot system Ubunto Win7 and XP. You don't even get to see the boot screen. They have this crash game setup a perfect balance. Crashes the game without having to restart your system so you can fire up the next crash strait away. Fun for all ages not much replayable elements after the 15th crash. So I'd wait till it's on sale in the crash bundle for $6 that way you might get some replayability from at least one version that works as a full game. I bought this after reading the steam reviews and coplaints and the TECH syndicate's Wendal is anoyed at simcity as I am. I never played it before because I was warned away from it when it came out. After 12 years it's only gotten moldy. I've played about 15 hours of a couple of versions. This game sucks, if your after a city builder. Play version 1 of warcraft and take out the fighting. The keflings series is way better than this effort. Half the buildings won't work and the game will not tell you why. not even a hint. You people recomending this crap should play some real functional games before commenting on what good games are.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
