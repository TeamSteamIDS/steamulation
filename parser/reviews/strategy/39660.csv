												A game with a fantastic concept that was very poorly executed, full of bugs and extremely difficult. The game remains largely unpatched since release for most of the inherent problems. This is a family dynasty simulator in which you economically grow your family via businesses and diplomatic relations within your townships. You can take office in local parliament, ultimately running the town (this is extremely, extremely difficult to even get close to this). You run business' of various trades, IE a Pub or a Blacksmith, you find a woman to marry, and have children with her, growing your clan and ability to pick up new business through your children (once they are controllable and at apprentice age).The Guild II has a relatively steep learning curve, and really is a good example of a difficult rts/rpg from early 00's. The Guild II has a nice consistent fantasy middle age art style and it would be nice to see the game remade in the modern day in working order for its conceptual ideas and simply the fact that nothing really like it has come out since.

												As The Guild II this game contains all that it's predecessor had, with a couple of new additions.  The expansion is worth taking if you buy the entire collection because the only new features are but few a professions and a campaign with a story consisting of 4 missions. As always The Guild is buggy and there will be glitches and odd graphical artifacts from time to time. If your only desire is to get a working Guild game in singleplayer and multiplayer as well then I can direct you to Renaissance: It has everything from the previous Guild games - the professions from Pirates of the European Seas patches, mods, a more or less active community.Minus the campaign, you won't miss anything.

												Pirates of the European Seas is a stand-alone expansion pack for The Guild 2 that focuses mostly on piracy, naval trade and combat creating many more options for those that does not want prestige but notoriety.The expansion adds a lot in terms of dependency between cities and this helps, in some degree, to alleviate the problems the AI have with maintaining production chains by letting the player sail around with ships trading between cities much easier and quicker than before. The piracy features also allow you a lot of new options in the opposite direction as you can now corner markets by denying access to certain raw goods in a specific city.The developers also took great note of the community feedback and while Pirates of the European Seas is hardly bug free it is a great step forwards from the main game.Pirates of the European Seas is a good solid expansion to an already entertaining concept and definitely worth a purchase if you liked The Guild II. It does however still suffer from poor AI and a somewhat broken economy.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Don't get me wrong, this game is great.

												Wonderful Sim and RPG. The blend of what and RTS an RPG and The Sims wouldlook like in a living simulated medieval Europe. This will keep you occupied for a LONG time.:)There is a gigantic world of opportunities and ways to play. Something which is quiet daunting for new players as it can be overwhelming to just start in any particular class or job. Also, the game is difficult. Very difficult at times.When a rivalling family has it out for you and you happen to be unprepared there is are few things from stopping them from ending your line before dawn.The difficulty slider only affects the amount of money and what social position you have in your city, the rest is a flowing, living community at any level.So, for those who are willing to put some time into it, there is a sea of possibilities to play with and the very nature of the fluency of the world makes it so that every play through will be different.As a final note: when out of ideas, you should try the ‘Back to the Roots: Sovereign edition’ realism mod, which, apart from a whole spectrum of realism tweaks and additions, adds a bunch of new social interaction options and job paths and the final political goal of becoming the sovereign of your country!

												This game is utterly fantastic. I have not experienced many of the bugs that others on here report, and have found the game to be very stable. The general difficulty is absurdly easy, I have never had under 100k after about 45 minutes of gameplay, and generally enjoy it when I can control the government with a family member in literally every position. If anyone causes trouble for you, start a trial and then just vote guilty (and since you control the government you have a family member in every jury position). You can then buy or steal every building in town, burn down your competitors businesses and then rebuild another building in the exact same location, and hire thugs to follow your enemies around. You can poison the cities water well to generate more business for your hospitals, and you can summon demons and spirits to give you gifts. Want your own private army of super powered thugs with full plate armour that can take on the city guards? Easy! Just be the only smithy in town that only sells to your own troops.If you want an easy game on ANY difficulty, just be in the business of raw materials of any sort, either food or wood or metal.

												Man I miss those days of playing games like these!. The Guild II - Pirates of the European Seas is essentially Guild 2 but with a bit more improvements applied over it which make it feel a bit fresh. The game is actually pretty good (not the best out there) but certainly among the better of the titles that attempted to emulate this genre!. There a some certain hilarious bugs (mostly not game breaking though) but hey, it's the Guild 2, those things are what make the game much more fun!. Highly recommended to kill some time and carve out a dynasty that can stand the test of time :P			",24,8,0,2,5,0,13

												I gave the game a chance. I very much had hope that it would turn out to be an enjoyable distraction. Paid 19.99 for the 3 game bundle version and I could cry over my stupidity. The game is kind of like a cheap version of the Sims Medieval meets age of empires. The tutorial was torment that I survived only to still be lost. The business buildings you can buy have an option that allows the computer to control them for the player. Which I assumed meant controlling any employees and assigning them to daily duties in the Tavern, bakery, farm or whatever building they worked. Along with the buildings upkeep and so on. But I found employee doing nothing. Had NO CLEAR direction of what tools or training I needed to provide an employee for a specific job. It has only been 24 hours since my purchase and completely uninstall the game. I think it is absolute bull I can’t get some of my money back. What happens to the games we don’t like or never play anymore? Can I gift it to another steam member? Transfer all the rights and such? I mean it is a purchased item I own and can’t return why can’t I give it away? Maybe someone else would enjoy it. Sucks I basically burned 20 bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Guild II is a unqiue strategy/life simulation game set in the medieval era. It brings many great mechanics from strategy games and life simulation games (such as the sims). It will take some time to learn, but once you have the game down it is very in depth. Worth a try if this is your style of game! Watch the video below of the tutorial to get an understanding of the game style and dynamics.Note: Get Renaissance, it includes everything from the previous two releases.
