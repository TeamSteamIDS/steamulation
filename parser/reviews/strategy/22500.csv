												Great game but beware, draconic DRM you can only install the game 5 times then your key becomes blocked.  Wouldn't have bought this if I new that, and no more buying DLC for me.  Not a recommended game to buy until DRM is removed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, buy the BASE GAME + the GATHERING OF POWER expansion. It includes all the features and content of the other two DLCs and it's a very naughty move on part of the developers to still sell the older two expansions on Steam, potentially making you pay $30 to buy all the expansion content, when you can be buying it for $10.With this unpleasant situation out of the way and despite it, I still highly recommend the game. It is co-developed by Richard Garfield of Magic: The Gathering and Netrunner fame. The game uses many concepts similar to MTG but is presented in a more casual framework. The major differences from MTG are: a) no card draw or deck but a set of semi-random given cards that don't 'run out' and are always available to cast if you have the mana, b) slot-based battlefield with two lines of 6 slots in which players summon creatures.Spectromancer is far easier to pick up and play compared to MTG. As there is no deck building, gameplay offers more limited options but the game livens things up with its unique class system, with each class getting its separate set of cards. Creature interplay is far more important and summoning order and spell support often require as much strategy as a game of MTG.Multiplayer, a very big factor for Spectromancer's appeal, is still alive and well, with available players at all times and lots of replayability given the large number of classes available.

												This is not a TCG (trading card game) and that's what makes it so great.There is no card collection or deck building, each game you get a random selection of 12 basic cards out of the game's pool of 48 basic cards and 4 special cards from the class of your choosing. ""So what if I get completely screwed over and only get bad cards?"" - That doesn't happen because a) the game is incredibly balanced, every card has its use and strength b) the selection isn't totally random, the game makes sure that you have 2 healing cards every game and that it's a fair mix of low and high cost cards ad that you always have board clear cards.So to get back on point what makes the lack of deck-building great is that you have to adapt to your cards every game. Do i try to get an advantage by being more mana-efficient than my opponent, do I try to win via board control or do I just rush my opponent? If you want to win you have to play to your decks strength. Also a big part of the game is reading your opponent and predicting what cards he has. One example: I'm ahead in board control, my opponent just played a very low impact card and he has a lot of fire mana saved up, that means that he is probably preparing to play Armageddon which deals a lot of damage to all creature on the board. So if I correctly predict this I can take advantage of it by not overcommitting and not playing any expensive creatures next turn because they'd probably die.Advanced players will use this to bluff you. e.g. a player might save up a lot of air mana which makes the opponent afraid of the spell Lightning Bolt, which deals massive damage to the enemy player's hp. So the opponent may waste his turn by casting expensive heals even though it was a bluff and the opponent doesn't have Lightning Bolt.All this predicting and bluffing wouldn't work as well if the game didn't have a limited number of cards.Oh I almost forgot the most important point about not being a TCG, the game isn't pay to win, it's all about skill.Other important points:- The game has still an active online community even though the game is 5 years old- The computer AI is really clever and good at predicting your moves, so if you don't like online play, it's never boring to play against the computer- The campaign is pretty okay, every fight has special rules, so it's nice and varied, though as I said the best thing about the game is the online play- you can get a lot of value out of the demo. I played like a hundred online games before I bought the game (but a year or so ago they added a 5 games per day restriction to the demo)			",125,19,4,8,5,0,19

												This is a good game. It really is. The strategy of the cards, the differences in approach as a result etc are all really promising. It gets a thumbs down from me though, and that's for one very important reason:DRM.I have no idea of the history of this game - for example, maybe they never coded it with Steam in mind, but 5 installs and then no more is ridiculous on Steam. Steam takes care of all the DRM'y goodness you need. Don't bother if you move across computers, it's really cheap but will still be a waste of money.Beyond that though, I give it a 9/10 for a strategy card game. I really do think it's that decent, particularly for the price. Shame they're a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has an elegant simplicity that quickly draws you in and enough strategic depth to keep you playing for many hours. It's been my favorite go-to game for a quick fix gaming session for many months now. In fact, while I've purchased lots of other computer based card games over the years, I haven't enjoyed any of them as much as Spectromancer since the long-ago release of Microprose's Magic the Gathering. If you enjoy this type of strategy game and can have fun without the bells and whistles of state-of-the-art animations, elaborate sound effects or eye candy graphics, Spectromancer offers great value for your money.

												I wasn't observant enough to see that there was a crappy DRM that only allows you to activate the game on 5 computers. I don't think it will pose a problem for me personally, apart from having to deal with activation codes, but I hate the concept. It feels like I don't own this game fully, and if I cared enough it could affect the way I deal with upgrades of my computers.But I will probably only activate this once and wont install it ever again, as it seems quite boring. I will also make sure not to buy anything from Apus Software or Three Donkeys LLC again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is OK,nice well made, addictive mainly to fans of magic the gathering and others card games, but....My review is about bad attitude that makes the Spectromancer have DRM:""Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Activation codeRenewal on request, 5 machine activation limit ""after that then your code key becomes blocked and need other activation code key again.I have a discussion about that:https://i.imgur.com/MG552L5.pngIs very important not only review a game but to inform about the whole experience as a whole.since aspect ,features of game, supported platforms, translations languages, dev/publisher relationship with the customers. Keeping out sensorship cap, abuses, bad business practices, false promisses and other things that need to be alert and warned in steam.So I would recommend this game, but not recommend buying it.Do not pay their money to be disrespected and not support bad method of DRM practices.Piracy is not bad at all, and some bad companies deserve it while different others good deserve be supported, recomended and not only about a good product but also for respect for their customers.(don't give them other chance, no deserve to be supported and treated us as kid):

												From the mind of Richard Garfield, creator of Magic the Gathering, and other similar gifted people.This is NOT a ccg, there is no collectible aspect. The available cards are determined by class, and randomiser. Don't worry, there are not that many cards that the randomiser can screw you to any relevant degree. The single player game is fun, but it is in multi that this game truly shines. Very enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really fun and surprisingly addictive.  It's kind of like a card game, but at the start of each game 20 cards are selected from your collection and those cards are the only cards available for that game.  There's no drawing involved - all 20 are available to cast provided you have enough mana.  There's a lot of variety as your deck will change from match to match, but also lets you do a lot of strategic planning during each duel as you don't have to rely on luck to draw the right card.

												Its a card game. If you don't like sometimes losing because you draw a bad hand, you shouldn't want to ever play card games. Well, Spectromancer is a bit different.There are 4 basic elements and 1 special element depending on your mage. For each element, there are 4 cards you can play costing various amounts of mana. These cards can either be spells or monsters. These cards are reused throughout the entire match. You don't get to choose which cards you get, and you don't draw cards. You may get a different combination of cards in different matches however as there are more than four cards in each element.You can have up to 5 monsters on your side of the field. Normally you get one of each mana per turn, but some spells give mana and a few monsters boost mana generation. I believe you start with 20 hit points and you can play a single card per turn. Gameplay is generally fast paced. You can die in a couple turns if your generated cards are weak against the enemy's. Since you get mana every turn, you can play several weaker monsters while waiting to cast a strong spell or monster. Balance between monsters is pretty good. Some are virtually unkillable with regeneration, some hit the entire enemy row, some are immune to magical spells. Spells can range from healing the player to wiping the entire field. There are quite a few deck strategies to use, but since you don't pick you cards you generally decide the strategy on the first turn.Cards that enhance mana generation are generally weak, but are very powerful in combination with monsters that grow stronger based on that type of mana. Use tanks to hold the line while nuking your opponent's life directly. Rushing the enemy down with swarms of low mana monsters. This isn't as strong since there are several spells that do damage to multiple creatures. It could be used to safely bring out a stronger monster once your opponent has nuked the field.The campaign is pretty fun the first few times you play. The opponents start off fairly easy and then get pretty brutal. Different decks help keep the game fresh, and the random combination of cards means you can't rely on solely one combination of cards to win games. I haven't tried the DLC, but they seem to add new mage types. These mage types represent the fifth element of mana. They are the unique cards that add even more depth to the game. I believe this game has been in an Amazon bundle recently. Therefore it probably stands to reason that if you have a backlog, you can probably wait for the eventual sale to buy this game. With Hearthstone coming out in the future, I can't see much reason to buy this game. But since that's not out yet,  you should pick this up if the game goes on sale. Fast paced card game with little rng.			",332,96,9,61,49,2,104

												I would like to present a strong reccomendation for Spectromancer, its multiplayer in particular. I don't have much opinion on single player, as I was drawn to duel games right away. But let it be said that there are several varying game modes in addition to a campaign.Multiplayer duels is what made this game for me. There are no cards to be found or unlocked through winning or other achievements, no grinding. You have all the cards available to you right away (with an exception of expantion pack cards, which are additional entirely new decks).Cards are dealt randomly, but within a predefined system, to keep things balanced. From then on, one gathers mana each turn and it's up to the player which cards to spend and when. This is a brilliant mix of luck and strategy, but with the point that you still have a chance of winning if you got bad luck. There are ways of bluffing your opponent, trying to outsmart them, manipulating them to reveal their hand, and various other tricks. Through the two years that I have played this game, servers always have been populated enough so I would rarely have to wait more than 1 minute to find an opponent matched approximately to my level.

												When the original Magic: The Gathering was created by WoTC, they never expected it to be so successful. It not only captured the hearts, minds and wallets of nerds everywhere who can't get enough of it, it made the founders wealthy beyond dreams of avarice. Just like the Federal Reserve convinced everyone that paper money was better than Gold, Wizards convinced nerds everywhere that cardboard was better than paper money. One day Wizards had an epiphany. If the Federal Reserve can print unlimited amounts of money, why not print unlimited amounts of cardboard? And so they did. In a perverted form of Magic Quantitative Easing, the printing presses ran non-stop. A litany of problems symptomatic of rush releases and lack of playtesting soon plagued the game: endless erratas, rule changes, Bannings, etc... The game slowly transformed from Magic: The Gathering into Lawyer: The Travesty. A game only someone like Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney can appreciate and Barristers play as a warm up to litigation. Co-created by legendary Wizards of the Coast founder Richard Garfield, it is not surprising that Spectromancer bears some resemblence to Magic. However there is no deck building and no rare power cards to 'collect'. The rules are simple and skill plays a bigger role than luck. A fun casual fantasy card game that can be enjoyed by people other than Rules-Lawyers.			",476,122,2,83,59,4,149

												It showcases many of Richard Garfield's design philosophies, and is all around a very fun and interesting experience. One of the main points is that there is no deckbuilding: you have a semi-random pool of cards at each match, so it's kind of a Limited experience. This may read like a turn-off at first to some, but it's actually what prevents the game from becoming stale - you must always be versatile and adapt to the cards that you're given for each match.The gameplay mechanics are extremely simple when compared to Magic: the Gathering, most experienced gamers should be able deduce all of them without needing to read the in-game manual. But the cards are interesting and the game is very interactive, so those simple mechanics still allow for a deep gameplay that involves a lot of decision-making.The game AI is surprisingly decent and can pose a nice and entertaining challenge at the higher difficulty levels. There's a great free demo available to try the game out.			",219,105,4,64,76,3,100

												Truly outstanding game, and in my personal oppinion, one of the best card games out there,better than Scrolls, Solforge, Duel of Champions and Magic the Gathering (!), and only beaten by Infinity Wars, which is, in my personal oppinion, the best CCG of all time.A game that combines nice graphics and sounds with an extremely well idea, balancing, community, cost-benefit ratio and AI, and furthermore, is very well developed, bug free and perfectly balanced.I have played this game for years, many hundreds of hours, long before it was released on steam, and still love to observers skilled players. At the start of the game, each player gets a deck of 20 random cards, 4 cards for each of 4 elements and 4 cards of a specific, chooseable class. Each turn, a player gets one mana for each card block, and can use it to sumon a creature in one of 6 different fields, or cast a spell. After that, the turn ends, and each creature automatically attacks the opposing creature, or, if the opposing field is empty, the opponent. And as simple as that may sound: this is one of the most demanding games i have ever played. You will need to think several turns ahead and overthink many opportunities each turn, to become a good player and achieve a high ranking.Still, it is very entertaining and motivating, never gets boring and combines lots of content for a small price.If you like card games, you cant do anything wrong with this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Underrated game with more balanced influence of the random than in MTG itself, in my humble opinion. Of course it is a bit easier, but it has special features which makes this game nice.Consider to play it someday.			",414,146,8,67,83,5,75

												The MTG pedigree shows in the engaging gameplay of this card based game. The Campaign mode is fun enough to play through more than once. The vs. AI mode gets kind of tedious eventually.The addition of custom deck mode via one of the DLC packs is very welcome though it's limited to just that mode, which is kind of annoying.

												Fun, but underwhelming. The cards don't gather quite enough synergy to be truly exciting, and the one campaign makes for repetitive gameplay. Still, for the short while it lasts, it is fun, and it's fun for a game or two with a friend.It's worth $10, although, at the price they are, I can't recommend the DLC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing card strategy game. Compete online. - always opponents available 24/7. Game has an element of luck, but there is a large amount of skill. You can pop in for 15 minutes or play for hours. This has now become my most played game on Steam!			",10,51,1,42,35,0,51

												A collectable card game that isn't a collectable card game! Instead of creating your own deck, each player is given a random set of cards in 4 houses (Earth, Wind, Fire, Water) and 1 specialty house of their choosing. A set of draw rules is in place to determine which cards each player gets, so it isn't imbalanced. It may sound like pure chance, but it's quite possible to predict your opponent's cards and moves and generate some strategy off of that. There's also a solid AI opponent to practice with. Fans of CCGs should check it out.			",218,12,1,19,1,1,11

												A great game, too bad it doesn't get enough exposure. A very refreshing take on CCG. No more splurging for rare cards! Both players has a fixed 'board' at the start of the game with a semi-randomised set of cards from which to choose from. Deeply strategic even from the very first move.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun game with great potential and the single player side of it is good fun but like so many other games now days ... the multi-player side of it has been ruined by hacks. I have  personally observed as people bumped their power scores with me tracking them on paper turn to turn so I play single player only as it is indeed fun. The game does have some balance issues. Some of the cards stats and / or abilities are not in proportion to what they cost.. There is not alot of strategy to be had here as most of the game play revolves around either being the one who stores up his fire power for the big bang or being the one who is over-whelmed by the unbalanced gameplay in spots. Believe it or not there is some fun to be had but you will run into the afore mentioned issues at some point.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spectromancer is paradoxically both too simple and too complex. Each match starts with you being shown your entire 20 card deck (no randomness here), and each turn you choose exactly one card to play that you have enough power for. That's the extent of your interaction with the game. You don't control who your monsters attack or block (they just attack directly in front of them), nor can you move them to a different column. Your opponent then does the same. Each of the twenty cards in your deck has some different effect. So do your opponent's cards. The winner ends up being the person who has the right one card in their deck of twenty to counter the other player's attacks. These sort of ""I Win"" cards are a problem in games like Magic, but at least you know they aren't guarenteed to be in your opponent's hand at all times like in Spectromancer.There's a lot more to a good digital card game than the matches. Unfortunately, Spectomancer is lacking in these areas as well. From the stock sound effects to the mundane card graphics, this is a very severly budget effort. The campaign consists of reading a page of fantasy trope nonsense, and then competing against your opponent.With so many other great digital card games, including free ones like Duel of Champions, why play this one?
