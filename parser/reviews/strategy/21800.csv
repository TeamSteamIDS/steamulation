												Despite having spent hundreds of hours playing this game on all platforms (I had a non-Steam CD copy and a PS3 copy), I have a love-hate relationship with this game.What I Loved• Simple (Yet Satisfying) Gameplay - The gameplay, while really simple (rock-paper-scissors), felt very satisfying, especially online. The moment a retaliatory WMD is alerted to you and you're wondering where the heck it's going to come crashing down. The moment you ambush some enemy combat engineers with your concealed Riflemen. So many cool and tense moments I've experienced in this game. Having a good result in a match requires having both sharp reflexes and an indepth understanding of how the game works past the understanding of the combat triangle spoon-fed to you in the tutorials.• Theatre of War - You could choose a loyalty to one faction and you fight for its glory + the team/community spirit in the online ToW (now dead, unfortunately).• Music - I still listen to it when I want to get the adrenaline up. Major thanks to the composers (Matt Ragan + Alistair Hirst).• Factions - To this day, I still think that the European Federation Enforcers Corps is probably one of the coolest near-futuristic factions ever created.• Voice Acting - The amount of variety in voice acting was great, and the general's dialogue (in the briefings) were really cool and all of them had a great sense of personality even if they were just an image that talked.What I Hated• Bugs - Anyone remember the transport-freeze glitch? There were lots of little things that bugged the original EndWar which still sometimes goes on in my single-player matches today randomly.• Upgrade Stacking - Every upgrade you purchased stacks on top of the other, so if you have a fully upgraded battalion you won't have much trouble trampling over any other player who had less than half the amount of upgrades you have. That, when the original ToW was still happening, was just totally unfair in my opinion, and was what contributed to the multiplayer's downfall; most newcomers got disheartened facing overwhelming odds at the veterans and gave up. You could not dodge or negate the effect of sequential bombardments of secondary powers on your units if you were a new player, which gave a grossly unfair advantage to the veteran.• Air Support - I do not mind having a type of off-map support which assists in destroying your enemy, but the way that it was implemented in the original game was just poor. Point-Click-AoEDamage, which you could hardly avoid (yes, I am aware of EMP stopping it, but you have to launch it almost the second the strike is sent, which makes it very hard to counter). Another game of the same type of genre, ""World in Conflict"", made by former ""Massive Entertainment"" (now ""Ubisoft Massive"", the ones developing another Tom Clancy game called ""The Division""), did a much better job with off-map supports with their timed, skill/strategic/luck-based air support as it rewarded those who could exploit their enemy's weakness when they were off-guard, or try to get the player to predict how their enemy would play and exploit that predictability.• Combat Tree - While combat was satisfying, it did feel way too simple. This was a major criticism of the game after it came out - everyone was requesting more depth to the game or to a potential sequel.Anyway, now that the main part of the review is out of the way, let me just take some time to rant about this one, massive thing which is still bugging me to do this day whenever I think about this game, which sometimes brings me back to play it occasionally...Potential Not Realised (Cut Content)I searched through the game files (audio, subtitle, code etc) and found a lot of cut content that never made it into the game. This cut content includes the following: - Wave Mode: The devs almost provided a gamemode for less-experienced players / people who did not like competitive matches against real people in the persistent online ToW. This mode had you fight against masses of regular army units, controlled by the AI, in which you had to defend your position. Winning a battle this way wouldn't have provided as many points as a player vs player outcome would have reached, but it would have contributed to the battleboard on a contested territory. It was also meant to be featured in the single-player campaign a few times as an extra gamemode. If you decided to play with an extra person, this could have been a pretty decent co-op mode that you could potentially play with friends to kill some time. - Terrorist Raids: The terrorist faction which you encounter in the Prelude to War story were not made solely for the single-player story - they were meant to provide yet another Player vs AI option for the online ToW to fight against if they did not wish to fight against real opponents to rank up their battalions, just like the wave mode. These terrorist raids would, obviously, attempt to raid army/air bases. Again, you could join up with a friend which would lead to another type of co-operative Player vs AI experience. - LAN ToW: The developers originally intended for players to be able to play their own ToW with or against friends if they did not wish to compete over the persistent online ToW. This is THE most annoying since the persistent online ToW is now dead - it could have kept a bit of that ToW spirit alive. - Cut Story Content: The main purpose of EndWar's original narrative was meant to serve as a conclusion to Ubisoft's first Tom Clancy saga. It meant to join up all TC media up until that point (Rainbow Six, HAWX, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell etc) into one game in an effort to end it all to make way for a reboot of the TC series to start fresh (which they're sort of doing now, what with Ghost Recon: Wildlands and Rainbow Six: Siege). Judging from the unused subtitles in the game's files, the overall background narrative of the entire game was meant to be set around a futuristic museum piece named ""EndWar"", which retold the course of events of World War III using painstakingly pieced-together recordings from the ""Overlord Battle Interface"", which commanders of all three contesting superpowers of the war used (the name of this interface is mentioned when the player has to go through the voice recognition tutorial at the start of the game). All of this information was meant to be told to the player by the narrator - the same narrator who spoke over the Prelude to War's introduction video. This narrator would provide more background commentary of the plot to the game and, depending on your actions, imply that the world in which the player is living in is under the control of one of these superpowers which has evolved into a New World Order (e.g. if the United States won the war, he was meant to say during the outro to the game ""With the emergence of three superpowers... with only one world to share... this concludes the story of the war to end all wars...  remember those who gave their lives to fight for our freedoms. Thank you, and god bless the United States of Mankind."" On the otherhand, if the European Federation won the war, the last bit is replaced with ""remember those who gave their lives to fight for unity. Discipline always, Citizens of the Federation"". For the Russian Federation, it was ""remember those who gave their lives to fight for state. Glory to the Motherlands! Return to your duties."" Check the files yourself if you don't believe me, it makes the original story concept seem way better in my opinion).And do you know what the most annoying thing about all this is? Literally all of the things I didn't like about this game were going to be fixed in their sequel - EndWar 2! They were going to update the story, the combat tree and finish the stuff that they didn't manage to fully implement for release which they had to cut. Such a shame. Hopefully Ubisoft come back to it one day, but I doubt it.			",218,6,0,24,41,0,82

												Right.So.Where do I start?Tom Clancy's EndWar is a real-time strategy/real-time tactics game, unfortunately neglected by its developers, released in 2008 and featuring a World War 3 where your decisions decide the course of the war. It involves three factions - the USA, the European Federation (A unified EU) and the Russian Federation (Which has again expanded into Eastern Europe. Including, to nobody's big surprise, Sevastopol). The interesting thing about EndWar is that it is not like other RTS or RTTs - you do not decide where each army strikes, or what to research, or even if you want to make nice with China so it invades Russia - you are a mere colonel in a special operations branch of your faction's army, and the only control you have over the world is where you deploy. Whether you win or lose the battle as a result of said deployment changes whether your faction grows or shrinks. Other world events, such as typhoons or the U.S.S. George Bush being sunk by your nation's WMD and airstrikes are communicated through the world map's news service.The campaign is split into two parts - a Prelude to War, in which the game explains the backstory and the game mechanics, as well as how and why World War III erupted and to give you a feel for each faction, and the Third World War itself. The AI is competent depending on difficulty level (On normal, for example, it is fairly competent, while on the hardest difficulty it is very competent), and the graphics are good for a game released in 2008.All-in-all, I would very much recommend this game to everyone. Unfortunately, the Theatre of War servers (WW3 multiplayer) have been shut down and as a result players are restricted to games with friends or offline games. There are groups that still play EndWar matches, however I am not sure exactly of their URLs - they are, however, active on the Community Hub.			",180,11,7,34,64,0,93

												Tom Clancy's End War is a war strategy game which takes place in a modern near future. Pros : + Good and interesting campaing mode + Replayability value + diffrent modes + 9.99 $    "" Worth the cheap price"" + 6 - 7 hours campaing   ( but there are 3 diffrent endings depending on the faction you choose) Cons: - Camera view problems - Sometimes AI doesnt respond accurately- Some maps look very similar - Graphics are not that good    "" Becuase it's a 2009 game :) ""  Verdict :  7 / 10    "" Good""			",137,18,1,10,9,0,9

												WARNING: SPOILERSEndWar is a game for those who prefer strategy over running like a maniac with SMG's. You are a colonel, your rank is only below the generals, although you really have more combat power than they do. As a commander of the Joint Strike Force (USA), the Enforcer Corps (Europe), or the Spetsnaz (Ruskies), you get your very own battle advisor, in other words, a war secretary, a whole battalion of your nations finest, and access to WMD's (Weapon of Mass Destruction). One of those weapons being a big sattalite dropping kinetic rods with enough firepower to take out Time's Square. The combat is simple. click on a unit, and tell it: Attack enemy, Secure Uplink (Major Part Of Game), Send Nuke Here, or even evacuate to ensure its survival. However, the game was engineered for one purpose,,,,VOICE COMMANDS. Yes ladies and gentlmen, even though this was made in 2008 it still surpasses even Googles voice search. Using a simple way of speaking to units such as, ""Unit 3, attack hostile 4."" Why use a mouse when you can just say ""SEND THE NUKE!"" Before I get excited, i'm gonna stop myself and just finish with this. Watch a gameplay video, see if its your cup of tea, buy the tea, and DECLARE WAR!			",44,9,0,4,5,1,6

												So a long while ago I met at a party this hottie who worked in Ubisoft Shanghai PR division. Endwar (made by Ubisoft Shanghai) just came out, but I haven't played it. I just knew the premise (World War 3) and special feature (voice commands), so I tried to pretend as if I played the game and loved it. She asked ""of all the 4 factions in the game, do you think that China is the strongest?"", to which I replied ""oh yeah, ehm, China faction is super cool, ehm, I actually like to play for them the most"". She just said thanks, walked away and I have never seen her again. Now, several years later, I played this game for the first time and realize that there is no China faction ... pretty enjoyable game though and the voice commands are very well made and fun to use.

												A VERY underrated rts. Unlike other RTS games, you don't use your mouse (though you can), bur rather, you use your voice. The game's voice recognition is VERY responsive and you won't have an issue with it. The only downside of the game is that it's capped at 30fps just like the console version. As someone who can't stand anything under 60fps it bugged me to no end. But the quality of the game made me look past it.			",203,11,3,27,11,0,35

												I got this on sale for $2.59 during a Tom Clancy Sale. Here is the thing with this game, it is difficult further along into the game. As long as you make good decisions, and apply real-world tactics to this game, you will succeed. Sending all your troops in to smash and bash the enemy will not work. It can be slow-paced at times, which means that it is not based off of your reaction time, but the best strategy. I would highly recommend this game to someone who has time, patience, and who likes strategy games.			",41,2,0,4,5,0,3

												EndWar is a decent real time strategy with a groundbreaking voice control feature. Unfortunately it doesn't always work as promised, so occasionally you have to shout your commands a couple of times more than planned. Eventually you'll just go back to the way you usually give commands; by using menus. It was a good idea but it was too early to implement it just yet. The technology wasn't entirely ready for this kind of gameplay back then.And yet despite this flaw I had a good time with it, because it does give you the idea that you're the commander in charge and there's an actual war going on. Now, there's not a lot of tactics involved when we're talking about the battles here, because the idea is based on the real life rock paper scissors game. So if you use the right unit against the other you'll most likely win (depending on the amount of units, of course). It's simple, but it works and it doesn't make the game tediously boring, like many other strategy games. It's by no means perfect, but it's definitely fun. Just avoid the voice control feature.[Rating: 75/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												A great turn for a strategic game, much more in-depth and planned out than your casual strategy game is. This one can be played with your own style without the frustration of tactics and is very open to your own decisions. It's also a nice touch you can customize your units and attacks entirely. Though the camera controls could use some work, I highly suggest this game for people who like a mix of action, war-based, light strategy, and free thinking type games.			",180,25,4,14,18,2,23

												Endwar is an AMAZING game. It's got good gameplay, combined with good strategy. Also it's got an awesome feature. In Endwar you can control your units by talking. It's got voice-commanding, which i find awesome to use when i'm playing campaign. For exampel, i can say: ""Unit 3 attack hostile 7"", and unit 1 would move to engage hostile 7.It's good strategy is amazing. Once i were up against 5 russian tank squads, i had 1 european tank squad, a gunship squad and an artillery squad. They had to move over a bridge to get to uplink Lima, so it got really dense at that bridge. By using my artillery, and gunships effectively, i destroyed all 5 russian tank squads. In Endwar, strength doesn't always come in numbers.Pros:Amazing strategy usage.Voice-commanding (I absolutely LOVE it! Makes me feel like a real commander xD)Good balanced gameplayCons:Multiplayer is dead, so if you're buying it in 2015 and up, you can only play singleplayerThe Theater of War online scenario ended in 2009, and no new ones have been hosted.In skirmish, the 3 factions roughly have the same units, with minor differences.My Rating: 4 Out Of 5 Stars			",100,7,0,6,21,0,26

												Tom Clancys Endwar is a Great RTS and Strategy GameIt provides hours of fun and entertainment for a low cost as well. Something else i really liked is the story on this game was alot better than i remember. Now it is not a ground breaking story and is not really rememberable i just enjoyed the short cutscenes after every battle that detailed the battle around the globe.ProsGood graphicsEach unit is unique and is needed for the overall successVoice command is a charmLow priceDetailed UnitsEach army has unique unitsConsMatches can become predicatable so play on higher diffucultyNot a lenghty story about 8 hours but not badOnly 3 armiesIf you want a fun RTS that is not too expensive get this.

												Great RTS. 8.5/10 Rating. I love RTS games and i must say this is in my top 3 behind Command and Conquer(most of them) and before Halo Wars. the voice command system is actualy not half bad, you dont have to scream in to the mic. you can talk in a normal volume, i even played it at collage in a room full of social people and had no issues(except when they were yelling)(ive played 8hrs so far and have had 3 instances where it miss heard me, i do not know how it would handle any speach impediments though). the camera system is a bit odd to get used to at first. there is no free roam camera, youre stuck to your units and can only switch between them. i like the unit upgrading system, although on harder difficultys its impossible to not lose all your units:P Would advise a 2.3GHz or higher CPU i have a 2.1(laptop) and am having frame rate issues(i can only run the game, no backround apps. running at all-_-)			",18,0,0,4,1,0,18

												One of the most underrated RTS Games it is almost sad to see this game be neglected by the community. Voice controls were revolutionary for its time, works better than a Kinect (Originally played it on the 360). The story mode is pretty decent if you want to follow it, and if you want to really focus on it you can always buy the novel cheaper than this as an E-book (Sidenote: I always loved how Tom would just give Ubisoft an idea and they finished a game before he even wrote the damn novel. Ubisoft just loves putting his name on any military game they have). The combat system is pretty easy to get the hang of, and I recommened to RTS players who looking for a straight up battle rather than worrying about politics and gathering resources like other games. Although those mechanics are really great, sometimes you just want to have a one track mind when playing games sometimes!Replayability is high, the combat system is great, the graphics are decent given the budget they had, and very sad to not see this series progress other than a flash game. Overall fantastic game for RTS fans			",48,5,0,15,2,0,10

My reviewLet me start off by saying that I normally don't do reviews at all. It's just something I usually ignore or forget. Although this game made me want to write a review because... Well it's awesome!The game is amazing, it has effective and simplistic mechanics that make matches complex and tactical. Don't be deceived by how ""easy"" or ""simple"" it is at first, when you start to really get deep into it, it gets harder and harder and more challenging, providing loads of fun for hours if needed. I'm not really a strategy type of player but this game was an exception and it was a huge surprise to me since it was better than what I initially thought. I haven't played fully much yet but so far, from the moment I got in until the moment I decided to stop and play later, it kept me fully entertained and immersed on what was happening. The only thing that din't please me and I might consider it as a con it's the fact that I could only put the resolution at 1280x720. So basicly, I totally recommend people to try this game. Both strategy and non-strategy type of players. TL;DRPros Simplistic mechanics but that can make the game very complex in it's own away (Trust me, when you have more than 9 units on the battlefield it can become a real mess); Amazing gameplay that comes both from the mechanics (previously mentioned) and the A.I; Addictive and immersive.Cons Couldn't put the resolution to native, had to use 1280x720 (but it's not that big of a deal, it's awesome anyway); Unfortunatly from what I understood multiplayer is dead. You can still play with friends and such but online would be better. (Still great game believe me and worth the money I spent). ",132,17,0,9,14,1,13

												Nice game, but seems to be more of a 3rd person shooter rather than a traditional RTS (real-time-strategy). I do however enjoy how you can hide you units from the other player, and the research and upgrading system. The voice commands are very good at absoarbing you into the game while leaving a degree of physical control. I'd recommand this to anyone who claims to be an RTS fan, because this is a stepping stone to what's next in RTS games			",32,2,0,2,11,0,19

Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Play another RTS title.Major Theme: A very unique spin on RTS games.Bought at Price: $5Most people know about Starcraft, and to a lesser extent the Command and Conquer series. If you were to ask a crowd about End War, almost everyone (if not everyone) would be wondering what you are talking about. It’s certainly not popular, mainly because the age of RTS games has come to an end.

The unique part of this game is the fact you primarily control units though use of your voice with a microphone. This may seem like a drag, which it was some of the time, but as you got used to it, you could logically think things though. Unlike “pro” players who attempt to boost their actions per a minute by clicking randomly/excessively, using your voice gives not only a much more even experience for all, but also a much more clear and concise one.

The campaign was quite simple, but had an interesting twist as all of Tom Clancy’s games (with the exception of Rainbow Six Siege). With 6 unit types it can certainly feel like rock paper scissors but that just means that unit placement is much more important. If you played command and conquer games, units garrisoned in structures will feel natural in this game.

In many ways, the game plays like Risk, but is much more than that. After playing the game, I am honestly surprised that this game isn’t heard of as much as the other popular RTS titles. Then again, when was the last time people played a true RTS game?			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												The Endwar is a RTS game in which you control three govermental armies such as USA, Europe and Russia. Each one of them have their own skills, advantages and disadvantages but if you rank them up their efficiency is more usable in the battlefield. The game can be controled either by your mouse and keyboard or use the voice recognition system.			",189,25,3,18,23,1,20

												If I were to rate this game it would be 6/10 or slightly above average. Beacuse of the games voice control option which I find very effecient and fun. Also you get to cusomize your own battalion in one of the three factions (JSF,EUEC, or SPEZNAZ Guard). Each faction has unique upgrades. It also has a skermish mode where you can play against someone or the A.I. But The multiplayer isn't the best in the world and the campaign can get a bit repetitve some times. There is a lot of story and characters from other games like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. I recomend this game to Tom Clancy fans or people that love a really long campaign.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty fun game if you can pick it up for cheap, runs well, graphics are alright but nothing special.Appears to be no conntroller support (at least not for my xbox pad) which was a bit annoying as controlling the camera in this game would be smoother with a controller. Rather than being a general with an all seeing eye in this game you play a colonel in control of a task force and you can only see what your units can which means use of the mini map is vital. This creates some really interesting intense moments and is a bit fresher than some other similar games.  I will say that the voice commands work great about 80% of the time but the odd word will not be recognized first time around (the game doesn't recognise me saying the word ""two"" I assume because of my accent) but it is usually alright.In short the game (if bought cheap enough) offers a pretty refreshing RTS experience with 5-10 hours of fun in the right hands and performs perfectly at least on my rig.EDIT* I have played this game previously (for about 6 hours) but it wasn't on steam			",78,8,0,2,4,0,17

												This was a surpisingly enjoyable strategy title in my opinion!I was very scepticle about the whole ""use your voice to command your units in-game"" idea but the voice recognition system is generally very responsive and accurate, I only had 1 or 2 issues with the computer not understanding what i had said through the microphone.The gameplay is very fun and fluid, unit deployment is rapid and there is no base building which was abit of a shame for me but the point capture & control idea still gives alot of fun.The multiplayer within the game was created to be large scale and persistent on a campaign map style setup, however there's a great lack of players online from what i witnessed and so although you will finally find a competitor, you may find yourself waiting for a little while first.Overall for the price i'd say this game is really worth the money even just for the singleplayer campaign and custom scenarios, just make sure you have a good mic else any static or weird noses may really make things frustrating when giving orders during a big fight!My Rating - 7.5/10			",247,17,34,23,50,2,52

												mmm.... Okay look. I loved this game back in the day. BUT! I feel like this game was meant for and better for console. I know that may be hard to believe, it's an RTS... but let me explain.Your Camera movement is restricted to your currently controlled units. There is no free panning with your mouse like traditional RTS games. Also, the factional warfare multiplayer part of the game is long long dead. I think you might still be able to play with a friend but I was turned off before I could attempt it.I love the games concept. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the infantry and wish there was more emphasis on them. They're also the only other thing aside from Artillery and WMD strikes that keep this game from being completely rock paper scissors style combat (Tanks --kill--> LAV's --kill--> Helicopters --kill--> Tanks)With all this said. I loved this game on console, the voice commands are very responsive and the game is legitimitaly challenging. However for PC, I can't reccomend this game.If they made a legit Endwar 2, kept the voice commands but made it a bit more classic rts camera style with more unique units. This game would be legendary.			",80,2,1,7,7,0,37

												This is another Tom Clancy game, starring Tom Clancy, based on a novel written by Tom Clancy, adapted to a cinematic video game medium experience licensed to Tom Clancy, by Tom Clancy.  In Tom Clancy's ENDWAR you play as Tom Clancy, and are on a mission to end all of the wars by fighting a war.  A ""War to end all war"" as it were.  Tom Clancy's game features an interesting play mechanic, in that you quote Call of Duty man's phrases into the microphone, and Tom Clancy preforms various tricks according to what key words were spoken.  Animal lovers may want to avoid this title, as about half way through the game Tom Clancy runs into the ghosts that he busted way back in Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon.  The two factions decide to settle their differences by seeing who can explode the most pidgeons from the top of the eifel tower (level is pictured in the games title card).  This is an excellent title for the Tom Clancy fan in your family, or as an entry to Tom Clancy's ""Tom Clancy's"" series.			",387,104,4,73,21,4,49

												The idea is amazing, but the end result is very average. If the designers comitted truly to the voice command idea, it could have been a very sweet game. Instead you are left struggling with both keyboard, mouse, and voice. Why use voice when you can just click? It seems to me for this idea to work, you have to either be able to do everything by voice or there would be no point.1) You can't take cover using voice, you have to click2) You can't control the camera using voice, not even with something as simple as ""camera left left left"", so you have to keep your hand on the mouse if only to rotate the view3) To move something or attack something, you have to know the number of the unit. What if you have 4 helicopters on the field and you want to attack a tank with the closest one? you can't, because you can't see the number of units on the map. So you have to keep guessing or switching between units looking for the right one. A better solution would be to have a bigger map, with numbers clearly shown above the unit icons.4) In time sensitive situations where you have to react quick, it is a real mess to attack the enemies because once again, it can be difficult to know the number of the unit you want to attack. Enemy tanks flanking on the left? Your helicopters are ready, but even if the tanks are on your screen often their number won't be displayed (it seems to depend on distance or visibility) so you can't efficiently react, and since you can't even send your units to a location by voice you'r back to right clicking.5) Mission command actually talks to you as you play, and if you are issuing commands at the same time you won't hear what is being said.So to make it short, even if the available voice commands work well, voice recognition is reliable, the game relies too much on keyboard / mouse for the ""voice commanding"" thing to really fly. But i can see how if they make aonther game in the series and address all these issues, this concept of ""hands free strategy"" could be really fun.			",360,75,5,72,42,2,66

												Couldn't even get past calibrating my microphone (Turtle Beach PX21 headset). Absolutely frustrating. Instead of trying to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RTS game for the Xbox 360 that has to use microphone controls that don't work, they should have just made it so that it can be played like every other damn RTS game on the planet, with a normal overview and without a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥voice command system.EDIT: After saying screw it and deciding to try to just use keyboard and mouse commands, I found that the game is actually quite fun. Interesting story and everything. However, I bought a headset mostly to play this game under the assumption that it would make it a great experience, obviously, I expected too much. I am changing my rating to recommend based on the actual gameplay. However, I still don't recommend trying to play with the voice commands, so don't waste money buying some if you're primarily planning to use them just to play this game.			",11,2,0,5,2,0,2

												Excellent game that provides unique and interesting gameplay. The atmosphere, world, and the factions are very well done and absorbing. I love the diffeent unit voices, and how they vary from unit to unit and even within the same type. The factions are certainly different, and you can really feel the difference when you switch a faction. The camera adds a new dynamic, along with unit proflduction and control. The campaign is really well done, and you feel like you're really fighting WWIII. My main issues are that the visuals are a bit eh, and the unit AI has major issues. Combat is really bland when you boil it down to 1v1 ex. watching tanks engage eachother and missing a ton despite being a block away. The lack of hard unit stats also bugs me pretty hard.

												It's okay-ish.Basically you're playing a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors that defies any military logic there is.This game is based around tanks killing infantry and APCs, infantry killing.. something, APCs killing infantry and aircraft, aircraft killing tanks, and engineers being killed and killing vehicles with rocket launchers.I regret buying it, to be honest. The gameplay is boring. The tutorial is painful yet you can't start the game proper until you've completed it.The camera is like the Total War general camera, but it can switch between units.Voice commands are cool, but you can only tell troops to either move to or attack enemy troops with voice. No movement if I remember correctly.For me it gets boring. The only fast units are vehicles, and they get killed easily, so you're either looking at half an hour of infantry attacking enemy supply dumps per tutorial level, or just watching them defend, as opposed to having vehicles run around quickly but get slaughtered.The storyline is pretty cliche, but is sufficient.I don't reccomend you buy this, to be honest. Total War or Blitzkrieg will give you a better experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gah, this game; developed by Ubisoft just as they started their downward spiral.This is EndWar, an RTS released on consoles back in '08 for the Xbox 360 and PS3, that means its a rather streamlined game considering the demographic the consoles were aimed at.It's a simple storyline. it's 2020 and the world is in an oil crisis, the petrol plant in Rozenburg is attacked by a group known as the ""Forgotten Army"" which is comprised of people from failed Balkan, African and South American nationales. As a result, the Big Three, America, The European Federation and Russia all prepare for a war against the group, not knowing that Russia itself was behind the debacle.Russian troops disguised as Forgotten Army forces raid a European military base, infecting the mainframe computer and causing a space laser to fire on an American space shuttle, effectively causing a Third World War.The game is as simple as it gets; point, click and watch the action. It's an RTS in the sense that an overcooked piece of steak is still edible, it's a real time strategy game and the ingredients are all there. But EndWar just doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Command and Conquer 3 or even Supreme Commander, both of which were released on the same console at an earlier date than this.The strategy is also as simple as it gets. Rock, paper, scissors gameplay means that versatility is out of the window. Wanna use your tank to destroy that engineer? Better make sure he's out of cover or else you're toasted.Another quirk I have is the way combat actually appears, they all just stand there, whittling away at each other until only one is left...and then that one vehicle or squad, whom you would think would make a last stand, becomes a disabled lump of metal or just five people standing around waiting for an evac chopper.Don't even bother with this...it's just a simple RTS that tried to hide behind amazing trailers and interviews.A mediocre game at best, a terrible example of hype at worst.

												I did not enjoy my time with this game.Voice commands did nothing to add to the experience for me. I went to using the mouse and keyboard because repeating myself did not feel great.Units don't feel balanced. Am I to believe that 1 Riflemen unit out in the open with no cover can over power two groups of my Gunships? Once enemy infantry do take cover, you pretty much have to take them out with artillery or overpower them with 4-5 units. I don't understand why Riflemen function like superheroes. My Engineers can take cover and be destroyed by a single unit of tanks, but when the enemy does it, I have to bring everyone or make it rain brimstone.Artillery > Riflemen > all other units. (Gunships are pretty fantastic at taking out Artillery unless they're protected by Riflemen.)Upgrades in the singleplayer campaign don't feel like they do anything. They always felt underpowered against the enemy's equivalent and would lose in one-on-one's with me having an advantage. Some of the unit abilities are fun.Camera angles are annoying and restrict you from making good calls. Having to switch between units to see what they see is tedious.No online (pretty much).Game looks nice.Missions are samey.Superweapons really hamper my ability to enjoy the game. I went out of my way to avoid the conditions that cause superweapons to trigger in matches. Did you have a couple units protecting a base? Boom, they're gone (as is the base/uplink). Oh, you spread them out and think they're safe. Boom, gone. Units can't move fast enough as the missile drops very quickly. It encourages spreading units out. Really out. Annoying at best.

												looked good until i downloaded it and it wouldnt load,i tried reseting my computer(2 times),i tried redownloading the game(once) and I even tried folowing the link to the help page and it didn't realy help,it just wasted more time after that I just requested a refund and gave up.I know this is a good enough game but the circumstances prohibited me from playing and i will likely try again but if that doesn't work I will(regretfully) just buy the disk from amazon or gamestop or some other company.P.S. I love steam and will continue to buy games from the site but i thought it would be appropriate to notify anyone buying the game that this might happen and if anyone has a solution to this problem please let me know.

												Extremely simplistic rock, paper, scissors gameplay could work if it wasn't for the fact that the camera is absolutely abyssmal and there's almost no ability to micromanage at all. The voice command system works but it's one of the few aspects of the game that actually does work. The gameplay is extremely underwhelming and the different nations are essentially the same outside of cosmetic differences.Quite simply - it's not worth buying.			",227,29,1,22,16,3,51

												This game is a disappointing strategy game. The following are the reasons:-The storyline does not fit other Tom Clancy's level, it only means to start a total war but forgets why;-The combat is more like a card game, which means that you cannot find any tactics in this game;-Even though it is published several years ago, it doesn't show any new factors.Conclusion:As for now, you'd better purchase Wargame instead:)			",68,2,3,8,5,0,23

												Why Tom Clancy would add his name to this garbage is beyond my understanding...You have about zero overview of the situation, because rather than looking from above, you can only follow any of your units. Yes, you can rotate the camera and even pan a bit, but your view moves with the unit and you basically can§t see♥♥♥♥♥♥ And even if yougo past that, the pathfinding is one huge tragedy. Do yourself a favor and find just about any other RTS on the market.			",155,57,1,32,18,0,37

												I must confess, I only played this for a few minutes ( a few missions, they were that short).  This ""RTS"" features a very clunky voice-activated command interface.  I could not properly callibrate the thing to understand me.  It kept saying it was too loud, even at a whisper.  I could not get any microphone attunuation to make any difference.You can still use the backup, which is a horride mouse interace where you go through several menus to say ""Unit 1 attack hostile 3"" and that is about all there is to your command interface.  You have some 3d follow camera which gives a very limited view of the battle field.  I do not know who thought this concept was a good idea.  I suggest that you just stay away from this title.  I just uninstalled it even though I love RTS games and have only played a few missions.  It is that bad.  All I can think of is that someone tried to create a console-friendly RTS and this is what they ended up with.  It is a total fail from a PC RTS interface.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												kinda sucks... the game claims it has hundreds of unit types... yeah... try 3-6 ... different unit types are jsut different models with no real stat differences or weapon differences...its main feature is being able to use a mic to command your units around... which frankly is useless, as i could use a numbered group and mouse faster then you could give a verbal orderAddition: let us not forget all the weird looks you will get trying to play it in public if you go to college or something while you sit there talking to your computer with noone talking back... i wouldnt know for certain as ive never tried it, but i can only imagine from seeing this oen painfully nerdy guy in the cafeteria at my collage screaming at his comp while he played world of warcraft			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want this game just get it for the xbox 360. Its way better for it. Sometimes the game wants to work, sometimes it doesn't (voice control wise anyway). I was doing fine with the commands, got to turn 18 in the story no problem, then all of sudden it decides it doesn't want to recognize the voice, and I spent 30minutes screeming ""UNIT"" at my computer and it gives everything but units. The icons for more distant things even don't show up on purpose so you have to use the voice system.All in 2/10. Ruined a great book for me. You should feel bad Ubisoft Shanghai.

												Tom Clancy's Endwar presents unique addition to the RTS genre, breaking new ground with many concepts yet unprecedented at the time of its release. Featuring unique, relatively balanced gameplay, a fairly competent AI, exceptional graphics, RPG-style combat unit upgrading system, and a voice command interface, the game presents an attractive addition to an RTS enthusiast's library.The game is set in the near future, in which the Middle East's oil market has long since collapsed due to nuclear fallout, causing worldwide increase in oil prices - and thus a worlwide state of panic. Russia, having taken advantage of the Middle East's collapse, is quickly becoming the world leader in oil production. The United States and European Union are rushing to complete superweapons capable of rendering nuclear weapons obsolete, while Russia initiates the largest martial buildup since the Cold War. Tension is quickly building up. The world as we know it is falling into chaos. The stage is set. 'Let the end begin.'Tom Clancy's EndWar was a fresh, entertaining game when it was released, and still retains its charm even today. The game is well worth the $10, and has a good deal of replay value. If you're looking for decent RTS featuring a fresh perspective and gameplay, this game is certainly worth looking into.Edited 8/15/15, removed formatting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I heartily recommend EndWar. Its twist compared to other RTS games is that you can use voice commands to order your troops or off-battlefield assets, and it suprisingly works incredibly well. However, don't push aside that mouse and keyboard yet as your voice commands are mostly simple commands. Move point A-Z, this unit attack that hostile, bomb this target, etc. Finer movements like better positioning or finding cover cannot be done with voice commands alone. Like I said before the combat mechanics make the game seem like a complicated rock-paper-scissors game, which it is in the prologue campaign, which you should still go through to learn all the commands or simple strategies to the game, but once you finish that campaign the game opens up into a much more complex RTS. Not WarGame levels of depth, but it is manageable for newer players. If there is one issue I find with the game is it's camera system. Your overhead camera  is always locked in on one unit and its immediate vicinity, which must be on purpose as there is a binoculars button that lets you zoom in on farther off objects that you can't see very well, because your cmaera is locked on your own unit. The way around this is by using your command vehicle unit which also allows you to use a birds eye view of the entire battlefield. However, even with this view you miss out on the action, and it doesn;t account for varying terrain height which can block line of sight. But overall I'm absolutely loving this game.

												If you are into RTS games, or the Tom Clancy etended universe, then you will appreciate this game. It is balanced enough that someone who had never played an RTS before could pick it up with little to no time. The only downside is the the promising voice command function is buggy, and I advise against voice control.			",8,5,0,3,31,1,15

												Very fun, very difficult. I feel as though the microphone makes or breaks this game. With it, it's a very innovative strategy game that allows for extremely fast execution of orders. Without it, it feels very basic and slow and doesn't really apply anything new.One downside however is the lack of any real single player campaign. This game is all about multiplayer, which as I understand it, no longer has any servers running.			",192,24,4,28,15,0,27

												Great game, but comes with a catch!   I've had a lot of fun and challenging experiences fighting the AI (though at sometimes it is extremely predictable). You have a large amount of customization and tactical options for your army, not to mention the ability to command your troops through voice commands!    There is however a major downside: EA has pulled the plug on the 'Theater of War' (the entire Online/Multiplayer component) and rendered a large chunk of the game inert. Unless you take to the Bungle jungle or Hamachi Haven there is no way to even play online with your friends or others. And even then, you will never be able to participate in an all-out World War III conflict as you were able to in the past. You will be doomed to roundabout skirmish games.   This has also damaged the community severely. There are still a few lost souls that roam the forums looking for fresh meat but their numbers are ever dwindling.    In the end, is this game really worth buying if a major component 'doesn't work?' Well, that's up to you! The game itself is great and you can still play the entire war out in single player, alone. Hell, you could even try to revive the game base and create a regular group on Hamachi. But honestly, wait for a sale if you are still unsure. If you can grab it for 5 bucks you will not be disappointed!   ~Playing this game is like walking in the dark: you may think you have no one else beside you because you cannot see them, but they are there, you just need to reach out and grasp them.

												A game with potential, but let down on some parts. I'd recommend it for its voice control of units and their potential upgrades. However heavy recycling of maps and lenghy encounters where you don't know if your units are going to come alive or not even if they are engaging an enemy they are strong against is major letdown.

												Certainly not the best in genre, but pretty entertaining nonetheless. Not a bad price at $10, although I would still wait to buy it on sale. $10 is worth it IMO....but still pushing it. I tend to have a higher tolerance for mediocre games than most, so others will probably only want to spend $5, at the most.The story isn't real fantastic...or really even there at all after the short prolouge. You do get news casts after every mission for the first 20 turns or so....but they don't really add anything at all to the experience. Most of it doesn't even pertain to what you are doing in any way. (a major disaster in America, for instance, won't actually affect any missions you do in that same exact area) The parts that DO pertain to what you are actually doing....still don't affect the missions at all whatsoever. Basically just mentioning how well/poorly you're doing in the war. Not really sure why they even added this in the game, especially considering they eventually stop appearing.The gameplay itself is where the game really shines (albeit, not very brightly. Especially not when compared to other games in the same genre). At the start of the main campaign, you choose to play as one of the three world powers (Russia, USA, or Europe) and then select a battalion to control (each with differing bonuses and unit preferences). Each mission consists of you deploying units and then using them to either capture uplinks, destroy ""critical buildings"", or destroy all hostile forces. Uplink missions can also be completed if you destroy all the hostiles, which ends up happening more often than capturing enough uplinks (especially towards the end of the game and/or when playing defense). After each success (or failure), you'll gain CR (credits) that can then be used to upgrade your troops for future battles. Units that survive the battle (even if they're defeated but successfully evacuate) will also gain ranks, which is mostly used to access the upgrades you purchase for that specific unit type.There's not a lot of resource collecting in this game. The only ""resources"" you have are CP (command points) with only two ways to collect them. The first is the capture/upgrade uplinks, and the other method....is just to wait until they recharge by themselves. CP is used for deploying troops, and also for using your supports. Supports include Air Support (bombing), Electronic Warfare (disables enemy vehicles) and Force Recon (deploys troops on the battlefield that can't actually be controlled, but can still be useful for defending). During most (not all) missions, you'll also gain a 4th support after the mission enters ""defcon"" phase (towards the end). The support is a WMD, and you can use it without spending any CP whatsoever! The bad news? You can only use it once before a long recharge time, which typically takes longer than finishing the mission. Another bad thing (or good, depending on the situation) is that the losing side gets dibs on using theirs first (although there are rare occasions when they actually won't). Another thing to keep in mind when using this WMD....is that you can hit your own troops with it as well.When it comes to missions, the game is very open-ended. There will usually be 3 or more missions to choose from, and it's entirely up to the player which mission is undertaken that turn. Often after completing a mission, your country will win/lose OTHER missions as well. This can result in one mission's victory turning into 3 or 4 new territories! It can also result in gaining one territory in exchange for losing another....While the voice commands are a great idea on paper, in practice they are absolutely HORRIBLE. The system is waaaaaaay too finicky to be of any use if you can't talk 100% perfectly in the way the game wants you to. You're better off just sticking to using the keyboard and mouse for everything.Overall the game is a pretty enjoyable experience, but nowhere near the best option. I would really only recommend buying it if you're looking for a cheap RTS and don't mind the outdated graphics (the game is from 2009, after all. Wasn't really top-of-the-line back then, either). If you've got money to burn....spend it on the latest Sid Meier or Age of Empires game instead.			",143,52,3,42,13,3,23
