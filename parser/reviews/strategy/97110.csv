												This is an early RTS that got a lot of things right, well before other games in the genre.  In particular, the way troops are organized into squads that gradually replenish themselves while in home territory really takes a lot of clicking out of the equation.  The clickfest thing has always pushed me away from RTSes, so it's no wonder I found this appealing.I owned a retail copy of this game more than 10 years ago, and when I found it on Steam I wound up getting it so I could finally finish playing through the campaign.  I tend to hop from game to game a lot and not finish things, but this was one I wanted to play to the end.  I finally beat it (it's not particularly difficult on Normal, except for the last level; I haven't tried Hard yet), and am looking forward to trying the other two Kohan titles that exist.From a modern eye, there are one or two things to put up with when playing this dated title.  The low resolution is a given, as is the resulting small viewable area.  When you order your troops around, or even click to select them, their vocal acknowledgements are annoying and repetitive.  Various other small bits of interface clunkiness, but overall I think you'll be surprised how many things they did get right.The Kohan series never made it big, and it's certainly not a well-known IP.  Kind of a shame; perhaps someday someone will acquire the rights and take another stab at it.  Then again, the story is not really the selling point for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play this game relentlessly in the early-mid 2000s. I had this game installed on my machine when it came out on steam and I picked it up and logged a few hours in (I had recently played probably around 50 hours or so not on steam).Pros in General: Great graphics for the time (the magic effects are particularly satisfying). Fantastic gameplay. Hillarious voice acting.Pros for Oldies: If you remember this game, get it. It's just as good as you remember it honestly. The gameplay is fantastically deep and rewarding still. The ability to mix and match front line units with support units remains as engaging as ever. You will be barrelled over laughing at the quality of the voice acting. It's so horrible that I can't consider a Con, it's just SO bad it's good! Seriously you'll love it. If you remember this game get it. And if you like games from this time period for their difficulty but sense of reward, get it.Pros for Newbies: If you're a fan of strategy games and you're looking for something TOTALLY different to what you've played before then get this. It's very difficult to truly describe the game but here's a shot. You have the ability to form a line of main troops (spearmen, archers, swordsmen, etc) and then give them a captain and two support units (cleric, mage, sorccerer, more spearmen, etc) and it's this combination that makes this game interesting. Finding the right faction and combination of units for you is a real treat as you will find new and exciting combinations and playstyles constantly for different situations. Each of the different factions plays very differently even though some seem to differ superficially with some skin changes and a few number differences with a unit change or two they are actually significant. If you're unfamiliar with games from this time period they're a lot more unforgiving than they are nowadays but not in a cruel way. More in a way that makes you realise you made a tactical error and the enemy beat you fair and square.Cons in General: It's a difficult game at first. Since some of the factions are essentially reskins with a few stat and unit changes, the battles can look pretty boring at times.tl;dr: Get it if you remember it or not. Great graphics, fun voice acting, a bit difficult, but will have you feeling rewarded and like a hero of the land in no time.			",148,12,0,37,26,0,47

												Kohan is a unique strategy game which blends the rts and turn based strategy genre together. It borrows many concepts from other games and add some features of its own which creates a very enjoyable experience. All things considered, Kohan is a hidden gem that has long been forgotten but has aged quite well. It has lenghty campaigns, great multiplayer and offers quite a challenge.The game plays like a realtime Heroes of Might and Magic combined with rts combat that requires more strategy and planning instead of fast reaction like most rts games do. It's all about training well balanced companies that can overcome the enemy and taking the terrain to your advantage. You need to conquer cities, outposts and ressources in order defeat your opponents.The ressource system is also fairly unique and allows for some strategizing, instead of gathering ressources you can erect different buildings which give you ressources which are used by other buildings or units. If you lack any ressources, this will be compensated by a heavy gold cost. This allows for some variation and is pretty flexible.Overall it's highly recommended for players who are longing for an unique and great rts.The only downside that I can think of is that the graphics are dated and that you can't change the resolution. Nevertheless the sprites and animations are really good for such an old game.			",115,11,0,36,10,1,47

												It's a good game, no doubts there. It must have been awesome when it came out though. It's a fun mix of RPG and strategy, you get lots of heroes to level and cities to build and expand.The problem is that there are so many other games to play that are newer and better (no i'm not talking just about the graphics) then this one. I would really like to see it being done nowadays, with much more in-depth citybuilding and troopchoices and troop-xp and generally a better UI.If you're looking for an old retro game that has a huge world to explore through several heroes and lore there's no doubt this ones for you.It allso has several expansion packs available so it's also a huge game overall.

												Fantasy Real-Time Strategy with a twist. If your normal, base-building RTS were a pizza, Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns would be pizza made with mango salsa topped with apple and bacon. It's still pizza, but it's a much different experience.Kohan operates as a real-time strategy game but the base unit is a company, rather than an individually represented unit. These companies consist of a front-line unit, two support units, and a commander (which can be either a default leader or a hero-type unit - one of the Kohan). This company structure gives you the ability to build to taste. You could build an all melee company, add archers for ranged support - or add a mage and a paladin. The various races of the game also offer some degree of spread when it comes to company unit structure.While this may sound overwhelming, the interface is actually pretty intuitive, and the tutorial does a good job of getting you familiar with the in-game concepts and their execution.Speaking of in-game concepts, another interesting feature set of Kohan is the title's ""Zones."" There are Zones of Supply - centered around cities and defensive forts, these allow companies to build and rebuild. Essentially, if a company can escape with at least one member remaining AND make it into a Zone of Supply, the entire company will ""heal"" (rebuild) without you needing to go through the expense of rebuilding it from scratch.There are other Zones as well, such as Population and Control - these are covered in the Tutorial, and moreso in the Advanced Tutorial. Terrain also comes into play in Kohan. Forests, for instance, add defensive value while limiting a company's Zone of Control - and Line of Sight. This is also covered in the game's Advanced Tutorial.As I indicated, Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns is a different experience. In many ways it's a step between your run-of-the-mill base-building RTS and a more complex ""wargame."" It's certainly not an ultra-complex wargame, but it's a small step in that direction.If you're looking for a good change-of-pace RTS, Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns and it's standalone Ahriman's Gift are good potential candidates.

												This game is worth giving a try.Kohan games have existed for some time now and are each of them one of those 'golden oldies hidden gems', imo. I wouldn't even go so far as to name a particular one that is nicer than another, although graphic-wise I'd recommend to try Kohan 2 if interested anyway.This game is an RTS, with simple base/building management, aimed at larger groups of units clashing with nice graphics involving the 'magic' used by the units. Micromanagement is very much canceled out, as to be able to keep focus on the units that walk around the map.The gameplay is simple and has a very natural learning curve. Compared to just starting the game, the tutorial is rather storybuilding, useful at best.Unit management is easy and clumsy at the same time. Little, though effective options for movement, sight range, attack, defend and retreat are amongst the choices. As soon as units are engaged in combat, only an option to flee or to rout the unit will cause them to break the fight. This can be annoying, but when you get around a bit with the game, is no issue at all and 'flee' can be used for ease of deploying troups somewhere else. Groups upto 6 units can be selected at once, and you can asign group settings as for movement. It doesn't work perfect at times, for some formations end up in a long line instead of a focused stance, but with a little moving them manually, it'll do.The game itself has quite some missions. Enough to be rewarding. The storyline is nice, if you feel for such thing, though the narrative can be quite boring to 'have to' listen to. I liked it.You in general start with a town, in which you can build a maximum of 4-7 components. The components are chosen out of 8, each having a choice of 2-3 upgrades afterwards with a variety of effects, so a very simple variety per town and it's abilities/purpose exists.In the end the thing is: make enough money and get enough resources to build and support the units, upgrade the town, upgrade the components, do battle.The units, of 5-7 members, are created from options that are reliant on the buildings in the settlement, You pick a frontline unit (4), support units (2) and a captain. By picking from various options of available units, you can slightly manage how you want to play your battles.Instead of the Captain, you can also pick from the Kohan available to you, which is a stronger (storyline) character, that becomes stronger by staying alive and defeating opponents.Hidden in the large maps, are items, more Kohan charaters and some treasure. There are most of the time enough critters, independents and enemies to keep you busy while expanding, exploring and conquering with your units.The maps graphically could've been better, though back in the days was fair. The game to me is more about the battle graphics and large scale unit clashes.Don't expect an RTS, like the traditional RTS games given birth by westwood studio's. This is just a different style, laying the focus a bit more on fighting, expanding, planning and moving than actual basebuilding and resource gathering. Micromanagement is as said possible, but simplified. The AI could've been better, but what to expect from an oldie like this. It still manages to give you quite a busy time when playing hard mode.Want to try something different? Kohan is worth it, in my opinion. Buy it in a sale if you don't want to spend on sight, either you like it, or you dislike it I guess, nothing much in between.			",122,9,2,54,24,0,73

												Ah, nostalgia! This is a great game (though a tad difficulty towards the end).  It DID take a bit of fiddling to get it working on windows 8, but I can run it no problem now (after about 15-20 minutes of working through the compatibility problems).  It was well worth it though.  Slight more on the simpler side as far as resource management goes, you get cool stuff in other areas, such as morale, formations that improve combat efficiency in exchange for speed, and the game actually gives you good reasons to try to flank your opponents!  A must play for all strategy gamers.			",216,49,0,86,21,2,42

												From my youth playing RTS games, Kohan always stood out as being one of the more unique and awesome RTS games. The mechanics are very solid and are worth anyones time if they have a love for RTS games and have not tried it before. I love the economic system, I love the fighting mechanics, I love the army building mechanics, I love the terriroty expansion mechanics, I love the campaign and the presistant progression mechanics. I love the incentive to explore the whole map and find all the treasure since it goes with you to the next map mechanic. Truly a great RTS.			",240,34,0,69,32,1,69

												TLDR; This game is a hidden classic.As my first RTS game, it helped ease me into the RTS genre.  It's easy to pick up and fun and challenging once you get further into it.  While im 95% sure that the online portion of this game is dead, you can still make your own maps and scenarios.  The story is great and immersive as well.  Just give it a shot if you are an RTS fan, and if you are not one this might make you one.			",135,16,3,22,9,2,21
