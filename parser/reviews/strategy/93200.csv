												The art style is FANTASTIC. That is the only positive game element to be had here. Save your money and stay away, regardless of the pandering reviews from what I can only assume are people who have never played tower defense games before. I mean hell, if it wasn't for the art style this thing wouldn't even survive on Miniclip. The game feels like a continuing list of bad design choices, a case study in what not to do in a tower defense time. When I complain I feel like a lecturer in basic game design: ""encourage strategic play"", ""present consistent rules for your game world"", or maybe ""release without game crippling bugs and advancement locks"". It's bad enough now, but be greatful you weren't playing when the campaign tech tree was locked and you'd be forced to menu-delete a game when an armored enemy type showed up an you had no units capable of damaging it. Almost every mistake (as I'm coming to call them, because I honestly don't think any of them were actually thought through properly), is at once trivially annoying and long term game breaking. Manually resetting and time consumingly repicking your tech tree to deal with new enemy types every level may seem simply irritating, but gradually emerges into an overall expectation that you pick the ""right"" tech tree that enables victory, and all others will fail by default. Having to painfully micromanage your reloads is grating, and eventually ensures that every strategy will be limited to your clicktimes and not your strategy, dooming any kind of open-world defense. And the rediculous armor and repulsion systems vex you piece by piece as your weapons and equipment become obsolete, before finally running the final, game destroying flaw: you will not lose when your defenses are overwhelmed, you will lose when the charming little boxlike enemies have countered every possible defense and your entire list of defensive options have become obsolete. It's like the equiptment they give you is just a taunt of what your strategy could have been: oh hey, here's a rapid fire turret. Too bad it does no damage to enemies after level 4, when they all have armor. Hey, check out these repulsion buildings to herd the enemy into chokepoints. Sucks that every other enemy after level 6 has become ""intelligent"" and will simply run up and eat them. Laser weapons? Armor reflects them - useless. Slowing razor field units? Can't be used with the anti-armor explosive guns, which destroy all your own buildings, including your own defenses, because apparently future scientists drink too much coffee to understand friend-foe ID. Similarly, saving up money in the campaign feels rewarding until you find out that the game raises the difficulty with your cash level and thus it's advantagous to avoid any kind of strategic spending. RotT plays like a cod game, where every interesting idea gets thrown out within ten minutes because it happens to be too fun and interesting to keep using. I like playing tower defense games because of the evolution of your goals and the resource management involved. I'm not sure I like playing them when resource management is a menial clusterf*** and the evolution of methods is only happening in the enemy forces. I've never had a tower defense game where I've felt so much like *I* was the computer, and the enemy forces were actually the human, getting to play adaptively against me with all the strategy and choice-making I was missing. Playing like a bot isn't a good feeling. I do not recommend playing like a bot. I do not recommend this game.  ",86,11,0,6,5,1,8

												This game looked like it would be fun, but the decision to make this a click-fest has ruined the fun for me. Some people may enjoy a game where you are frantically jumping around the map, but to me tower defense is about planning defenses, not lighting reflexes.The single biggest problem is that you can't build while paused and only have a few seconds at the beginning of the mission to build your refineries and set up your defenses before the enemies start coming, ready or not. The enemies don't follow consistent paths and can easily destroy your towers, which means that in the mad rush to get towers down they won't be placed optimally and will probably be destroyed, wasting money that comes all too slowly from refineries.This snowballs with the fact that your finances carry between missions, so if you spent all your money and barely passed a difficult mission, you'll be broke at the beginning of the next mission. This punishes the player for not playing perfectly and makes some of the later missions basically impossible because you didn't play the early game just right. The difficulty also scales with your finances so you have to be in the sweet spot of enough money to build enough towers but not too much money that your get overwhelmed before you know what is going on.At least the game isn't as clicky and punishing as it used to be, in earlier versions you had to manually click on refineries to harvest them and turrets to reload them and the tech tree used to be yet another source of punishment to inexperienced players so there might be some hope for this game, but at this point I still don't recommend it unless you like a rather punishing, frantic click-fest.

												Tower defense games seem to come in two sorts these days: those where stages are played like an RTS from an overhead view and those where you get down into the trenches FPS-style. Revenge of the titans is by far my favorite game in the former category. This is because the range of options it provides, and the incentives it offers to explore them, make it much more centered on creative design than anything else in the genre I've yet played.Titans works essentially like every other tower defense game: set up defenses around something, a wave of baddies swoops in to destroy that something, you must manage your defenses in real time until the stage is complete. But Revenge also has some features which differentiate it. The pixel-art graphics are charming, though they can be a bit confusing in the thick of battle. If you've played anything else by Puppy Games you'll know what I mean as this style is their trademark. Personally, I think it another great strength of the game, though it may not be everyone’s cup of tea.The stages are very large and very open. The defenses you construct are not bound by a grid, and will likely consist of many, many components rather than just a handful of parts. The size also adds to the challenge: enemies enter the map from many different points in a single stage and are can be difficult to coral. All this gives you a considerable amount of freedom in coming up with a defensive plan. Many towers interact, so you will be designing and placing installations with scores of interrelated parts, not just putting up some towers on established paths. Complementing that freedom is a component of management and upgrading. There are two aspects to this: first, there is a deep upgrade tree which, over time, grants you access to new and better towers. This provides a variety of weapons and defenses, but also forces the player to choose which to ultimately prioritize meaning that by game's end you can have very different sets of advanced tools at your disposal. Second, the resources you use to build must be procured during stages via mining, and your balance caries over from level to level. (Thus, in typical PuppyGames fashion, how you play in one stage carries over into subsequent stages.) The fact that your starting resources for the next stage are what remains from the last makes the game into a campaign, and provides an added incentive to devise elegant defense solutions which conserve resources. Both of these features can mean that it’s possible to get into a situation where a stage simply isn’t feasible due to your prior decisions and mistakes. Conveniently, you can return to any prior stage at any time and play forward again, so your decisions are only as set-in-stone as you want them to be. I found that this actually created replayability, as I went back to try and conduct a better campaign. On the other hand, there were a few points where I found I needed technologies in ways I couldn’t anticipate and had to backtrack to get them.To sum up, Revenge of the Titans is a tower defense game that gives you space to invent and a reason to do it. If you like the traditional tower defense genre and also enjoy the sort of creative design typical to good sim games there are hours of fun for you in Revenge of the Titans.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

This review is rather long, so if you just want a small summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.Puppygames develops an awesome tower defense game which changes the elements of your traditional TD. The awesome research options between levels, harvesting of resources, and the variety of tools to change alien tactics creates a unique experience between each level. Campaign:Revenge of the Titans, obviously you know the name as you are looking at this review. This game offers an interesting differentiation onto a typical Tower Defense game; enemies destroy your towers and the idea is to block the path rather than create a route. The world is being attacked by an alien species from Jupiter’s moon Titan. The name of the game seems to make me believe maybe we attacked them first? But yet again there is no real story other than the world is under attack and you are chosen to lead the defense force. You not only defend the earth, but you progress through the solar system defeating the alien scum at each planet until you finally arrive to Titan. Each planet has about ten levels, each which offer new bosses and pose new challenges that keep you on your toes. Gameplay:The towers are upgraded by placing upgrading towers adjacent to towers. This is interesting as you can place multiple add-on towers adjacent to a tower to create rapid fire towers, or even long range sniper towers. The difficulty curve seems rather perplexing, with little explanation onto how to play this game can seem rather difficult till you figure it out. The game is incredibly entertaining, once you figure out the general gameplay you can really get into this game. You are given one upgrade point per level which you can use to customize your defense force. With about 73 upgrades and only 50 levels means you cannot research every possible option. The game allows you to respec after each mission, which allows you to manipulate your towers to achieve optimal defenses for each level. When playing the campaign make sure you remember that your money transfers between levels (and your towers automatically sell returning funds from the towers). This information is useful, as you can start saving early making the later levels easier. If you mess up after beating a level and lose too much money you can go back replay the level prior to it and fix your mistakes. This allows you to bring a better end result and alter your starting cash in the next mission. Results:Revenge of the Titans is an epic tower defense game that drives in new challenges and creates new concepts not seen in previous games of the same genre. The campaign is long and difficult, on the standard setting, but you can make it easier at the drop of a hat. Each level requires you to respect in order to take advantage of alien weaknesses, but this makes each level dynamic and unique. Pros:+Fast paced tower defense game+Upgrade screen allows for between match tactic customization+Transfer of funds between levels means how you play the level before impacts the later levels +Power-Ups transfer between levels, so you can easily stack them. (I for example used none of my abilities until the last level to make the final boss incredibly easy).+Great difficulty curve, if you are a beginner you can significantly reduce the difficulty to ease up the levels. +Gameplay from prior levels transfers to the next level, meaning you must play tactfully throughout the entire game. Cons:-Poor tutorials, by the time you figure out all the nuances of the game it’s already over. (I for example didn't realize that levels don't start until you place your first mineral extractor until level 48 - this would have been useful to know early on)-Recommended upgrades seem rather worthless (it’s better to just rush barricades)-Not a traditional tower defense (there is no maze building, and to upgrade towers requires add-on towers which can be hard to space)			",331,44,5,40,30,0,70

												Revenge of the Titans: It's just not fun. The interface seems designed to be intentionally annoying. Contrived gameplay issues overcome the fun animations and cute tongue-in-cheek storyline.For example: It seems to be an intentional design choice that the playing map is just a tad larger than your screen size, no matter what resolution. With invaders coming from all sides, you have to roll the edge of the map left, right, up, and down to follow the action on each side of the map. So watching the action on one side of the map means, by definition, that you can't watch action on the other side. It's just a bad design choice to make the game artifically more difficult. A difficulty gimmick, if you will.Annoyed and done after about 2 hours. Thought I'd like this more, but... oh well.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												At first, the game looks like your regular TD, with towers and upgrades and such, but as you progress through the game, you realize that there is alot of♥♥♥♥♥♥you need to research that you didn't, which can create some pretty hectic battles. There are a few rules that are always constant, but there are major gamechangers as you move from planet to planet. If a map is too hard on campaign mode, you can generate a different map in less than a second. The game promises an intense, blitzkrieg set of battles that will keep you sweating, and many different ways of dispatching the hordes of titans. Like manually zapping you enemies? buy capacitors. Want your buildings to do the work? Buy defenses. Feel like taking the fight to them? Droid and tank factories.

												Revenge of the Titans is what you get when you inject some real indie love into a tired genre - style, innovation, experimentation and instant playability. Some may find themselves frustrated with a customization approach that leaves room for epic failures, but most will find the open-ended nature of it all quite refreshing.Revenge of the Titans doesn't bring too many new ideas to the crowded tower defence genre, but its blend of real-time strategy and arcade action does provide it with a unique twist. And it looks and sounds great, too! A clever, huge and charming strategy game. While the puritanical focus on retro minimalism means it might not be as rich in visual variety as its contemporaries, the breadth of the strategy coolly grants it safe harbour from the grey reaper of rinse'n'repeat boredom.It's simple, well executed and, so long as you're not bothered by a little trial and error with your research, good fun.

												Damn. What you have done to them? Doesn't matter. Now they're here on planet earth and want their revenge. This little tower defense game does not even feel like a real TD game. That's very positive. You always struggle for life when hordes of Titans seamly relentless jump/run/fly to your base to destroy it. Built turrets/lasercannons use mines/powerups and shields ... it's insane, the possibilities are countless and every round you research a new technology which is perfectly explained by a crazy scient named Dr. Zed. The aim is to push them back in the solar system, finally to the moon Titan where they obviously came from. The graphics are rogue-like, arcade style, black with neon elements, like the other Puppygames. BTW I think, this is the best of them all. I recommend to disable monitor flicker in options menu which is only cosmetical but not very helpful.			",1650,667,58,135,165,17,216

												Very interesting game-play, keeps you thinking about not just the approaching enemies but also your resource supply and income which you need this to build. The game gets challenging but you are also rewarded unlockable tower weapons, defence buildings and also repair units to make life a bit easier. That also depends on how one uses these properly by placing them in the most effective areas to get the maximum efficiency. The enemies also do not follow a fixed path and adapt to the situation. Regrettably, the game is flawed in quite a few ways. Mainly, lack of variation. All enemies look pretty much the same, and behave identically. Overall this game is worth a shot but it might not interest some players.			",54,10,4,5,5,0,2

												It's tough to recommend this game unless you really REALLY like tower defense games.Going through my backlog of games, I started playing Revenge of the Titans which I got from a Humble Bundle years ago. At first, it was kind of neat. The art style was simple and kind of cool, the music was decent (in the end levels in particular, there's this really good ambient track), there was a little bit of humour in the campaign, and it seemed like there would be a lot of variation in enemies and weapons as you level up. But several hours in and the gameplay flaws really began to show.- There are maybe 3 very distinct enemy types. There are tons of enemies in this game, but they pretty much vary only by things like ""oh, this guy moves faster"" or ""oh, this guy has more armor"" etc.  - Level after level, the grind shows itself. Same gameplay, pretty much every single level. (Other than when you need to use the Capacitor, a specific weapon used for a specific enemy type.) There's never any variation, or anything that makes you scratch your head and plan something out. And the art of each level pretty much varies only by colour.- There's loads of weapons and gadgets to unlock and use, but you'll most likely end up using the same combination of weapons for every single level once available.- Campaign is started on the hardest setting by default...and it's mind numbingly easy.Most of my play time was spent grinding for the last few achievements (which was honestly the one thing that kept me going.) So, I'd give it a 4.5/10. It is a decent game for being so cheap (especially from a Humble Bundle) but again, only if you are desparately wanting some sort of RTS/TD game can I give a full recommendation. The developers also seem really nice too, and are active on the discussion forums, which is a plus.			",110,27,2,7,1,0,5

												Firstly the game looks funny and there are many interesting ideas implemented but after a while you totaly see what is really unique in this game, the difficulty. Don't get me wrong hard is okay but here it reaches a level thats only interesting for masochistic players.  And here is the reason why I think so, the money and powerups are shared in all missions. And if you had trouble in an earlier mission you start the next world with a useless low amount of money. And powerups, they are much more rare then feral white elephants in Scandinavia. So if you haven't saved enough from both earlier you have to replay the whole campaigne to collect the powerups and money for the final.No this is not fun, this is not innovativ this is just unneeded timesink!And whatever the ""Restart level on lower difficulty"" button does, it is no easier map restart.Yes, exactly this killed the game for me completly.

												It's an interesting tower defense game, in the sense it has a campaign, and depending on how you progress through it, a level may be rather easy (with enough funds and boosts saved up), or actually impossible.  The creeps also attack your structures (melee and ranged attacks), which is different from most games in the genre.  It's actually more like a defensive RTS game, in the sense the creeps only loosely follow a path, which is more realistic and varied, but it also means there's little opportunity to exploit their path tactically.  I guess I like everything about the game, but find the actual defense part to be a little unsatisfying.      For a big TD fan, I would recommend this game, but for the average gamer, looking to play a TD game, I would recommend Defense Grid, Plants vs Zombies, or Sol Survivor (probably in that order) before this.

												It's more like a rts with no mobile units in your arsenal rather than a tower defense with actual planning phase. Game gives you little to no time to prepare and expects you to be constantly on the lookout up to eigh sides of the map after randomly creating your base on an open spot. The problem is, map control is bad so you have to scroll to all sides placing stuff and repeat it hundred times so it gets boring quickly. And although repick option before every level on your tech tree is nice, it gets almost mandatory to repick and redesign everything half game. Won't really recommend for that price.

												A questionable game. The core gameplay is your usual tower defense: place shooty towers to shoot the monsters, place buffy towers to buff the shooty towers, place special towers to do other things like acquire more money. This part is fairly solid.I can't stand the wrapper, though. To start with, upgrades have misleading mouseover descriptions. The game is played on a small map where monsters appear from the fuzzy dark edge and quickly approach your base. With this in mind, you might think that researching the Scanner (description: ""Long range detection systems using radar and lidar imaging to improve early alien detection"") would extend the map a bit, giving you more space in which to place towers and shoot monsters.But no, the Scanner is actually a buffy tower that increases the firing range of the tower it's placed next to! No ""detection"" is involved.In addition to this misinformation, the campaign mode is very unfriendly to going back and trying to improve your score. Suppose that you've advanced to (for example) level 6 of the campaign, and you're not happy with your performance, so you decide to go back and replay level 3 to accumulate more points there.The extra points from a better completion of level 3 are not granted to your global resource pool on the campaign map, but to your next play of level 4. Thus, you'll have to replay level 4 and level 5 as well in order to get the new advantages transferred to level 6. In general, you won't be playing with your best results - you'll be playing with your most recent results, which makes it frustrating to attempt to improve your record.The ""Distortion FX"" setting that is on by default and jostles your screen at irregular intervals, and the typos in technology descriptions, are just icing on the cake. Perhaps these things are meant to appeal to some sort of misguided realism, but when I'm blowing up alien titans with nanotechnology weapons, I don't want the absurd realism of having low-quality flickering displays because the war caused a power shortage and my character couldn't get spare parts delivered. I want an interface that lets me focus on the gameplay, and the lack of such an interface is the worst fault that I found with Revenge of the Titans.			",51,15,0,41,16,0,48

												I want to like this game, but I found it swiftly crossing the line from challenging to frustrating. It suffers from the standard RTS problem of too much going on at once. Levels are either too simple and over too soon, or alien swarmfests where there isn't enough room to put a tower in or enough time to figure out what's getting blown up where. Maybe other people enjoy repeating levels a dozen times before things are just right, but I certainly don't.It provides an easy mode, but that doesn't seem to help with the fundamental issues with the game.

												9/10Another Puppy game from the masters of genuine '80s retro styling. This time they turn their attention to Towers, Walls, and defending a base from a horde of Aliens.What happens after the Space Invaders land? They advance on important human bases. How can humanity defend itself? By building towers to shoot at incoming aliens, of course!With a simple ""collect and refine"" system for raising funds to keep building, and enough turret types and bonus boosts to make them work better, the levels can be tackled in various ways, and if they're too hard you can restart any level as an easier version. R+D happens between levels, with just a tad of plot and in-jokes. It's enough fun for the price, if you don't mind 8-bit style graphics (Which do really fit the general feel of teh game.)

												Tower defence, quaint voxel style art, and a whole lot of upgrades that do nothing.Each level lasts about a minute, depending on if you respecced into the right upgrades or not.  There's not really any placement strategy, as the monsters just kinda wander from where they spawn towards your base.  There are tons of upgrades that you unlock one at a time, and you can respec before any given level to change up your weaponry.  Once you find the right combo of upgrades that actually do anything you basically stick with that for every level after that until the game throws a wildcard at you and you need to respec the entire tree.That said...  Theres nothing particularly bad about this game.  Everything works as it should.  The design is all there, but theres nothing particularly great about any of it.I don't dislike it, I just don't reccomend it.			",70,14,0,15,10,0,7

												This game is unbalenced, as in you can actually take and look at the cold hard numbers and notice without trying that it is unbalenced. I'm not even kidding there are literally things in the game that can be proven to be only there to waste money slow down the rate you get money AND waste research points.The developer of the game flat out admits that they balence the game based on their ""feel"" rather than actually checking if those numbers made sense or if parts of the game only existed to waste your time.Don't even get me started on research, the research system is full of vaguely worded topics of nebulous values, things like refineries, reprocessors and collectors are coded specifically to be not worth it in most situations, whereas other things are required to move forward through the game but aren't useful until they are essential.In short this is a game about trial and error, and if you do decide to buy it do an in depth read of the wiki to find out how much of the research tree, towers(in a tower defense game), and other things that have been specifically hammered down to be as marginally useful as possible to the point where using some of them is a surefire way to lose.

												This game is incredibly difficult, which I've noticed is why a lot of people don't enjoy it. While it is frustrating, it's the same kind of frustration caused by games like 'Super Meat Boy'. I can guarantee, fans of 'SMB' (aka masochists) would love this game simply for the replayability and difficulty curve, and I think that's the major issue. This game's targeted demographic is tower defense players, but 'Revenge of the Titans' follows almost none of the normal tropes of tower defense games like 'Bloons Tower Defense 5' (a well polished browser tower defense). 'Revenge of the Titans' I believe suits fans of games with heavy replayability and difficulty, better than the average tower defense player. Now, that isn't to say other tower defense games aren't hard, they just aren't difficult *in the same way* as 'Revenge of the Titans'. 'RoT' requires a much more significant amount of spacial planning and strategy due to the ""open"" nature of the map and undefined enemy waves. There is also a good deal of micromanaging in collecting powerups and bonus money while simultaneously keeping an eye on your turrets, buff towers, and factories, whereas in lots of other tower defense games (like BTD5), you usually just place your towers and then sit back while the wave finishes itself, and this I think is the most important difference between RoT and other tower defenses; *the amount of attention required by the player at any given moment.*TL;DR While many of the defining qualities of 'Revenge of the Titans' is a huge turn off for casual and/or average tower defense players, it is these qualities that make 'RoT' such a fantastic game for people that enjoy heavy replayability in tandem with masochistic amounts of challenge, and who don't like to sit around waiting for a game to finish its ""autopilot"" to do something again.

												This game looked cool to me because I like tower defense games. About 2 hours into the game I can't motivate myself to continue. There is no real challenge and the upgrade system seems meaningless. This game is not totally bad but it feels very mediocre to me. With so many more polished and fun tower defense games on Steam, there is no real incentive to play this. Definitely not worth the full price.			",326,34,3,20,14,2,37

												Great potential, design is bad. Only redeeming feature is the artstyle (and the only reason I bought the game). The game just gets way too hard, way too quickly and doesn't follow any of the Tower Defense Genre norms (eg. balanced skill tree, preperation time before waves, and countless other basic faults.) The game was fun while it lasted (on the earth levels) but once I hit the moon ♥♥♥♥ turned hard, and bloody quick too. The game can be fixed easily but you are probably better off going to MiniClip and play the Monkey/Baloon Defense game. P.S. The game didnt get hard due to lack of skill, you just had to know what comes in the level before you even get there! I ended up just placing mines in a line as my main form of defence.

												Tower Defense games never gets old. They really do have a lot of appeals to the gamers. This one is no exception. They did it with 8-bit retro graphics, which sometimes can get too 'blurry'. Some higher resolutions would've been nice. The colour scheme is also a bit lacking. The result, a good TD game but visually boring. Don't get me wrong, it IS a good game but there's no 'pull' in it. I didnt feel the need to plow through or to finish next map and the next and the next and the next. You can see that this lasting appeal problem is true from the 'most helpful' positive reviews section had a lot of people who says 'recommended' but had a grand total of single digit hour of playing the game. It's just a bit lacking. There are other better TD games out there.			",377,193,27,64,44,5,92

												Revenge of the Titans makes for a good mix of RTS and Tower Defense but certain aspects of the game hold it back. The game starts out simply enough with it's simple/geometric art style and ease of game play. But the difficulty ramps up in later levels and you will be punished for mistakes you made in earlier levels. The amount of money you have to use in each level is rolled over to the next. So if you let many of your buildings get destroyed, they will not be recycled and that money will be gone even though you won the level. Adding to the difficulty, upgrades to the tech tree are necessary but you don't really know how much they help you until you use them which requires a lot of practice and trial and error. Many buildings you use early on in the game also prove to be less effective or even useless in later levels. You will need stronger, more expensive guns but you will not have the money to purchase them because you were not careful in the earlier levels. Do not be deceived by the cute graphics! I breezed through the early levels but then felt like I had missed some very important strategy when I got to the later levels. But by then it was too late and I did not want to back track and replay all the early levels. This may be heaven for a hardcore strategy fan but, personally, I found it too frustrating and chaotic in the later levels to be enjoyable.			",90,9,2,5,4,0,9

												TOO HARD, TOO RANDOM!!!!!Edit:I tryed to give it a second chance, but i puked. This is not even a game! So much randomness! It's trial and error. Enemies just go around your buildings or attack them, randomly. Stages have random enemy types. When you win, you win by luck! Upgrades are useless. Most of techs (upgrades) are there to unlock other techs. No planing required - strongest turret wins. Huge levels WITHOUT a minimap!!!! You like to scroll, from left to right, from right to left? Yes, you do! Everybody likes to scroll, especialy when something explodes somewhere! You never build in the middle of the level, because the paths of enemies are unpredictable. So you try to block them where they spawn, but they just go around you, through the black edge of the level. So you build closer to the edge, so you can't even see who or what spawns. This is fun, isn't it!?			",73,37,1,10,8,0,18

												Revenge of the Titans is a really well done tower defense game. There are a vast amount of options for play. There are user created maps and campaigns as well as several included campaigns and modes.  The gameplay is tower defense but the enemies don’t follow a predetermined path but will wander. You also have freedom of placement of your towers, so there are many ways to set up your defences. One of the things that I like about this game above other T/DF games are the RTS elements. There are resources to gather and upgrades to get. The upgrades are more towers, unit spawners, and support buildings.  It’s really a lot of fun.  It’s not complicated or very deep but I don’t believe that’s the point.  This is very much a game (in the sense that it’s main goal of the game is to just be fun, nothing serious at all).  Most of ‘Puppygames’ games are lighthearted in tone and pretension.  I respect them for making genuinely fun games. Give this game a shot, it’s a lot of fun and well worth your time and money.

												The highest-average-rated game in the original three indie bundles a few years ago, I believe.  It's fun, diverse, and employs a variety of old-school tower-defense features which can keep a casual player goofing for hours.After the difficulty-cap begins to level off due to poor-leveling, the game can become tedious for me.  The levels player over and over again, with no immediate solution in site.  Often times the last thirty seconds of a won match can boil down to liquidating player towers like their walls, so various amounts of destruction ensues.For it's price, it's perfect.  It's a thumbs up.			",16,1,0,0,1,0,5

												Clean graphics, and it has a style of its own. I like it. It's pretty much a tower defense title, except that you earn money to buy and upgrade things like buildings and money AFTER you finish the mission. Everything you buy will then be available in the next mission(s). Since the enemies walk around all over the map and they don't follow a certain path, it's more a tower spamming game. You just place towers all over the place (well, as long as you have the money), and most of them will do their job perfect. I'm missing the strategy part here, which is a real shame. Other than that, it's worth a try, just not for the full price. Get it when it's discounted (€5 or less).[Rating: 77/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												Revenge of the Titans is a real time challenging tower defense game.  After each level you can choose an upgrade for a turret or study science for more upgrades.  Every level is randomly generated, so every time you play it will be a little different.  There are a lot of turrets and building for you to choose from, like one that makes the range of the turrets bigger, or ones that gather crystals for money.  The art style of this game is great and cind of retro chic.  The music is also very good, they are remixes of classic music like Toccata and Fugue.  Overall, this game is great for people who like tower defense and i love it!  I give 9 out of 10 stars!			",76,7,0,1,6,0,4

												I've played all manner of tower defense games and Revenge of the Titans has quickly become my favorite. Instead of placing all enemies on predictable rails, the developers let the baddies attack from all sides and all directions. The art direction is supreme and the difficult curve is set just right. I'm still trying to figure out exactly how / when / why to upgrade certain technologies, but there's no penalty for depth in a genre that usually lacks substance.			",93,25,1,3,3,0,11

												Nope. Very low budget looking, which I could be fine with, if everything else worked. Every level looks the exact same, as it is some brown terrain with your base at the end and then guys coming from off the screen. First off, there is no enemy variety, they all look and function the same, strike 1. Then there is the fact that the spawn points make no sense and they will be all over the place meaning you have to defend a ton of different sides, making your defense weak at every point, strike 2. Then, in a tower defense, their pathing SUCKS. They don't follow the actual paths, they just kind of randomly run at your base and spread out all over. Oh and don't forget they will attack your base, and the game tells you not to build it in their path, but then makes them have inconsistent pathing. This means no matter where you build your tower they will run at it and attack it and you will always lose your towers, strike 3. Then there is the fact that your towers have TINY range and won't attack them about until they are getting attack themselves. This also means you can't put towers behind each other or they won't attack the enemies, strike 4. Then there is the fact you cannot maze at all, because if you put up walls they just attack them instead of try to get around, strike 5. Then there is the progression system. Each level you get 1 unlockable. Problem is, they are usually wasted. If you want a new tower, you need to get like 3 unlocks, meaning for 3 levels you waste your unlocks, and during those 3 levels you don't progress or get stronger at all, which can be a problem/ The other unlocks, don't give you a good enough idea what you get or the effectiveness, strike 6. You will get things like collectors to boost refineries or cooldowns to boost towers, meaning you have to spend points researching them, then during the game you have to spend tons of money buying them, just to boost your towers, instead of just researching tower boosting stats, which actually makes sense. Also, the boosting towers you don't get a good idea how much they help, strike 7. In game scrolling over towers doesn't give stats, just shows sell prices or name, not letting you make informed decisions, strike 8. Then there is the fact that at certain points you will be unable to beat the level based on the way you specced. So you need to respec and keep using trial and error to get the right combo, meaning you actuall have little choice as you can't win with different combos, strike 9. I do like the mustache captain that talks though. Needless to say, after so many strikes and missing every part of what a TD game is, this game is OUT. 5/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												Big fan of Tower Defense style games, and a sucker for the the retro gaming art style. The game mechanics are tough. I still don't feel that I've completely mastered them despite finishing the game with 100% achievements. I find Defense Grid a more enjoyable title overall, perhaps simply because I feel I better understand it and feel like I can grasp the winning strategies involved. Revenge of the Titans can be frantic at times, but that's why it's a little bit special. Perhaps part of it is accepting that you will lose towers.Revenge of the Titans is a worthwhile title if you can pick it up on special, but far from essential. A light recommendation.

												Got this nice little gem during the second Humble Indie Bundle and the guys who made it deserve every bit of my donation! This game is mainly of the tower and defense genre where you must fight waves of aliens of varying strengths and abilities. Don't worry though, you have a MASSIVE arsenal at your disposal. The tech tree in this game is pretty big; there are plenty of weapons and upgrades in the game to suit your style of tower and defense strategy. There are power ups that can be used during the game as well to change the tide of battle like freezing enemies, nuking them, stimpacking your turrets, etc.Overall, this game is highly polished. The presentation I believe is flawless because I enjoy the pseudo 8-bit style. The controls are easy to grasp and there are of course hotkeys to quickly build your defenses. The campaign is a good length and the game is just enough difficult to keep me from snoozing. There are achievements in-game too, but I wish there were Steam achievements!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By combining Real-time Strategy and Tower Defense, Revenge of the Titans offers more than a good tower defense game. It looks great, performs well, and delivers very deep gameplay mechanics that will make one hungry for more. Build up your Economy, place your turrets, upgrade them with add-ons, do Research and Development, build Battle Droids, use Orbital Strikes, do anything to stop those gruesome monsters from destroying your base!It also features Toccata and Fugue with modern bits.I don't know what you will do in this game, if you ever play it, but I can tell you, you will be facing thousands of monsters and hours of fun.Recommended!

												Puppygames games are excellent, and Revenge of the Titans is not an exception. Responsive, accurate, visually amazing, and with variant choice and adaptive difficulty. My complains are very few and far between:My one problem with the visuals is the effect for an enemy hitting your base. It REALLY hurts my eyes when the main base is hit, and the entire game jiggles about like a fat person on a trampoline. It'd be brilliant if this could be reduced or turned off.The titan AI seems a little... erratic. The game doesn't have enemies on a preset path exactly, so when i place my turrets out of the way, enemies will sometimes still walk over to them and destroy them. While this isn't exacly a PROBLEM, it's still something I wasn't a fan of.Other than that, the game is amazing, and you should definately buy it.

												This game is absolutley amazing. I love it a lot, and its a real representation of what I belive a good tower defense game should look like. It's unique, cute, and has a lot of gameplay to offer. Just buy it already. ""Why?"" you ask, because not only is it worth your time, but your helping puppy games. Ive read every blog post they've ever made, and I feel I've seen their progression and downfall, and it makes me want to cry, because it was a studio of indie game developers making games that, I enjoyed, but they fell under anyways. I reccomend you go and read all their blog posts to, or at least this one, http://www.puppygames.net/blog/?p=1574These developers have been through some hard times, and I love the games theyve made, especially this one, so why not buy it? On my other steam accound it gave me over 30 hours of enjoyment, I think thats worth 10 dollars, wouldn't you say?			",109,26,1,6,30,1,21

												Revenge of the Titans has excellent art design, is really challenging, and the towers and units have a pretty solid feel to them in gameplay and animation terms. It took me a long time to get around to finishing it due to the fact that the campaign used to allow you to corner yourself in a bad part of the tech tree, but this has since been patched out. What's left is a game that's suitably challenging and open-ended to be quite fun - for the most part.Of the complaints worth mentioning, some of the levels are so dark that even with my screen brightness turned all the way up I can barely read the terrain. It's also not always clear which objects block construction or obstruct the firing arc of which turrets (but to be safe, assume almost all objects block your turrets from firing).My biggest problem, though, is with ghostly enemy types that can only be attacked by manually using a Capacitator turret against them. This rips you away from the high-level strategic game into click-driven micro instead, and I think that really interrupts what is otherwise an exciting and challenging high-level planning experience, much to the game's detriment. If the ghost/capacitator system wasn't a part of the game, you'd have a much more cohesive experience overall that really lets you get into the flow of things.That said, it's still a good game, one of the most engaging tower defense games I've ever played. Give it a shot and just keep your eyes on those damned capacitators (which, incidentally, are a good way of defeating bosses).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very pretty, with a variety of enemies and an interesting and large research tree, but ultimately ruined due to poor balance and bad gameplay decisions by the developers.At it's core, it's tower defense with funds and research carried between levels. You can replay old levels in order to improve your funds or undo research choices...but going back is permanent, losing your progress after that level. Essentially this makes the game about creating a single, perfect, optimized run...which most people would find incredibly tedious anyway, assuming the gameplay was interesting enough to support constant replays - which it isn't. At the very least, you'll be replaying every level at least twice: once to learn what you're up against and where everything spawns, plus at least one run to beat it with minimal losses. This gets tedious real quick.The big problem with this is that the game *also* penalizes doing well. Difficulty scales to your funds (= how well you've done so far), and it's not a minor correction, either; monsters get significantly harder (up 3x life and speed) and more numerous and crystals ($) actually stop spawning at all after a certain point. That's ridiculous, and what's more it doesn't go back down unless you lose the game repeatedly and let the monsters wreck your base. In a game whose mechanics practically mandate replaying levels in order to get perfection, this is ENRAGING.There are plenty of other problematic design decisions (extremely large damage ranges for some weapons, easier difficulty requiring losing to access, lack of a sandbox mode, most Research being useless, etc.), but this is the big one. Ultimately, the game encourages you to play one way, and when you do, it punishes you for it.I don't write reviews very often. I want to like this one so bad, and I've gone back to it repeatedly...but not once have I had fun with it for more than a few minutes.			",203,44,1,40,16,2,55

												Revenge of the Titans is a Strategical(RTS) Tower Defense game where you can either upgrade or expand your arsenal after each round. It can be quite brutal in difficulty at times, but it also forgiving with retrying. I found it a challenging experience with plenty of possible approaches and playstyles to the game.During play it also actively engages you with player controlled turrets ('ghosts' for example need a special player controlled turret to be killed at first) and it regulary drops some boosters like bombs, freezes, and more or even money to pick up by point and clicking on the battle field. These acquired boosters can be saved cross mission and be used by the player in dire situations. The campaign will keep you busy for a while and you can play it differently on another play through. The DLC also offers a sandbox mode. In my honest opinion; it's a game you can play, enjoy, put down and re-play again when your bored. The only thing that I would like to see is a multiplayer mode DLC, it very much feels like an expanded version of tower defense games from starcraft and warcraft if you are familiar with it.Lastly; I found the graphics quite pleasing, it looks simple but everything is clear and its fairly entertaining to look at. The game has its very own identity, and refreshing art style which is further proven by the other games in the same graphical style and theme by Puppy Games.For the 10 euro's, it is a good buy in any case. As of writing it is on sale for 2 euro's which is dirt cheap, I'd recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most addicting tower defense games I have played in a LONG time. With tons of upgrades and countless different types of enemies to encounter while trying to protect your command post from being destroyed. The artstyle and music in this game is very cartoony and looks very well done. After you pick a new upgrade, you get a funny little cutscene from either the scientist, or my favorite the general.

												Sorta a fusion of tower defense and an RTS, this game is all about researching new tech as you advance through dozen of levels and blasting hundreds of baddies in hopes of not being overwhelmed! Enemies don't follow certain paths all of the time and you're free to build pretty much wherever you want so each level will be tackled differently from player to player. The research tree is pretty extensive and will have a major impact on how the campaign progresses for you - making bad research choices can really screw you over! All in all its a pretty deep and fun TD/RTS game!			",244,33,5,58,32,1,65

												Let me start off by saying that this is is a great tower defense game. This is more difficult than many of the other tower defense games out there, yet easycomers or young children should not fret since their is an easy campaign in addition to the normal campaign. The game also features an endless mode, a survival mode, and a sandbox mode. The missions are non repetitive and usually include new maps with new spawning locations. The graphics, at times, can be beautiful, but are often hindered by the game's dark atmosphere. There are many things I found that set Revenge of the Titans apart from the other tower defense games. For starters the game places you in the game with a base that you must defend and roads leading from the spawn areas to the base. One would assume the enemies would follow these paths? That person would be wrong as the enemies travel along the path only to increase speed but swiftly disengage the path to attack nearby towers or form a direct path to the base. You heard me correctly, the towers are destructible, easily so in fact. The towers must also reload ammunition, slowly I should add. All these things add to the difficulty of the game, yet I am thoroughly pleased as this adds unique challenges and situations and surprises to the game which allow the game to remain a fun challenge, even after hours of playing. This leads me to the research screen. After each level, the player is rewarded with medals and a research point. The player can then use the point in the most advance research screen I have ever seen in an indie game. This screen feature a myriad of choices and subcategories. One fault i must find is that although the player can research towers, these said towers can not be upgraded, other than the placement of other upgrade towers nearby that can also stack in boosting power up to 4 times. After an hour or so of gameplay, I am throughly pleased with this game and recommend that others pick up this game if on sale, as I find some difficuly in justifying $9.99 for a game which resides in the overflooded quantity of tower defense games on the steam marketplace. Unless you are a large fan of tower defense games, I find that picking this game up for less thatn $5.00 is a sweet spot, as I was able to use the %75 off coupon to receive the game for $2.49.

												i've been holding off on reviewing this game until i watched the films in the franchise first. i finally got around to that, so here is my review.the story/lore starts off about a small redneck football team trying to make it into the big times. denzel washington does some great acting, so it works out well. (i don't understand why the title had ""remember"" in it, since it is the first movie. perhaps a hint for a prequel?)the demand for more was so great that they signed on for a trilogy set in the same universe, but further in the past. it's about the dinosaur era where giants roamed the lands and fought with the greek. good films. definitely some hints in a post credit scene about where the football team got some of their genes from. definitely worth the popcorn i kettled.i guess some people complained, because the original football weren't in those last few films. someone read our petition at change.org/petition i think because they made us a game. this time it is set in the future. it seems to be implied that a side-effect of being raised in the south, famous, ignorant, and ruggedly swole (thanks titan genes) is that you reproduce like crazy. the football titans have mated to the point of overpopulation, and they are mad. so they are getting their revenge. fun little game really. try to stop them from uprooting all cultures and installing footballism in its place. it's a race against time. are you big enough for the titans?

												Sorta a fusion of tower defense and an RTS, this game is all about researching new tech as you advance through dozen of levels and blasting hundreds of baddies in hopes of not being overwhelmed! Enemies don't follow certain paths all of the time and you're free to build pretty much wherever you want so each level will be tackled differently from player to player. The research tree is pretty extensive and will have a major impact on how the campaign progresses for you - making bad research choices can really screw you over! All in all its a pretty deep and fun TD/RTS game!			",244,33,5,58,32,1,65

												This is a pretty tough Tower defense game.   Its a little hard getting used to the way things work.  Dropping a tower and correctly spacing it so its not to far or wasting space (since you can drop towers almost anywhere its easy to block things. Also when you hold own your mouse key it will keep dropping towers and walls.. this can be annoying if u want to be very accurate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have only played endless mode so far, it's not like a traditioinal turret defense. Instead endless being on a single map with endless amounts of enemy waves, the map changes for each level. Every level has a different are where the enemy attacks from so it at least keeps you on your toes. It gains an RTS aspect because money is your currency and you can throw down refineries to help gain extra $$ in a game. The money carries over into the next round. All pixel graphics... I'd wait until its under $10 to buy, I just say RTS/TD and had to buy.			",111,7,0,6,9,0,15

												Game: Revenge of the TitansSummary: A fun, somewhat unattractive tower defense game Rating (5/10 = failure): 8/10Multiplayer: NoCompletion: 17 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesCost:  ~1 USD bundledOh wow, a story! It's mostly for kicks, but at least it gave me a reason to play (as sarcastic as that sounds, I actually mean it. I feel like there was a point to all that).The research system is fantastic. It may look daunting to the first-timer, but once I got used to it, I started to wish it was even bigger. As it is, it's good.While I'm sure it's meant as part of its aesthetics, the battle environments always look... sterile and off-putting. I would have liked to see some daytime areas, forests, cities. Maybe more weather effects like rain and snow outside of X-mas. Instead we get... rocks. And more rocks. In pale pastel colors. Add to that an ever-present, pointless dim spotlight effect which makes everything look dull and dim. On every stage. It's a fun game, but borderline unappealing and somewhat hard on the eyes.I'm not sure if I was playing it correctly, but I had difficulty setting up towers along paths, as creeps would invariably destroy those towers (not including the creeps that specifically go for towers). In any case, it didn't matter in the end, as I found that on most maps I could just make a super defense perimeter around the base and nothing would get past it except for boss monsters, in which case, all that required was a second set of towers attacking the boss right away.The automatic difficulty scaling could use some work. Once you get the hang of the game, you'll quickly start to rake in funds. But if you do too well (+50k in funds), the game gives you zilch next stage. It feels like it's punishing you for doing well, and even without looking it up, I could tell the game was ""cheating"" by doing that.Out of all the Puppygames, I regard this one as the best. It's not frustrating, it's not brutally hard, has a good length, several game modes, and even the stages I failed it didn't remain failed for long.			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

												Tower defense games seem to come in two sorts these days: those where stages are played like an RTS from an overhead view and those where you get down into the trenches FPS-style. Revenge of the titans is by far my favorite game in the former category. This is because the range of options it provides, and the incentives it offers to explore them, make it much more centered on creative design than anything else in the genre I've yet played.Titans works essentially like every other tower defense game: set up defenses around something, a wave of baddies swoops in to destroy that something, you must manage your defenses in real time until the stage is complete. But Revenge also has some features which differentiate it. The pixel-art graphics are charming, though they can be a bit confusing in the thick of battle. If you've played anything else by Puppy Games you'll know what I mean as this style is their trademark. Personally, I think it another great strength of the game, though it may not be everyone’s cup of tea.The stages are very large and very open. The defenses you construct are not bound by a grid, and will likely consist of many, many components rather than just a handful of parts. The size also adds to the challenge: enemies enter the map from many different points in a single stage and are can be difficult to coral.  All this gives you a considerable amount of freedom in coming up with a defensive plan. Many towers interact, so you will be designing and placing installations with scores of interrelated parts, not just putting up some towers on established paths. Complementing that freedom is a component of management and upgrading. There are two aspects to this: first, there is a deep upgrade tree which, over time, grants you access to new and better towers. This provides a variety of weapons and defenses, but also forces the player to choose which to ultimately prioritize meaning that by game's end you can have very different sets of advanced tools at your disposal. Second, the resources you use to build must be procured during stages via mining, and your balance caries over from level to level. (Thus, in typical PuppyGames fashion, how you play in one stage carries over into subsequent stages.) The fact that your starting resources for the next stage are what remains from the last makes the game into a campaign, and provides an added incentive to devise elegant defense solutions which conserve resources. Both of these features can mean that it’s possible to get into a situation where a stage simply isn’t feasible due to your prior decisions and mistakes. Conveniently, you can return to any prior stage at any time and play forward again, so your decisions are only as set-in-stone as you want them to be. I found that this actually created replayability, as I went back to try and conduct a better campaign. On the other hand, there were a few points where I found I needed technologies in ways I couldn’t anticipate and had to backtrack to get them.To sum up, Revenge of the Titans is a tower defense game that gives you space to invent and a reason to do it. If you like the traditional tower defense genre and also enjoy the sort of creative design typical to good sim games there are hours of fun for you in Revenge of the Titans.			",144,42,0,12,19,2,43

With a lovely retro feel to the graphics and audio but with clever games design throughout you won't be disappointed. With many ways to play through the campaign by following different tech trees this game will offer you 20+ hours of gameplay.Check it out :)			",281,44,14,18,28,0,33

												While i agree with the amount of people saying that the ""Difficulty rises too quickly"" and that the game ""Punishes you for spending all of your money in one mission by making you broke in the next""...(Oh and there will be S.P.O.I.L.E.R.S in this review, so theres a warning)I can't deny that this game has some very fantastic mechanics, the art style is just AMAZING for one, the tech tree brings variety into the game, will you fight your enemies with explosive rocket launchers that can damage your turrets, or will you go full god like and have powerful blasters behind them with buildings that increase their range, damage, ammo capacity, firing speed and decrease reload time. Or maybe you just think ""I can do SO much better!"" well, sadly you can't have a tower that shoots, but you DO get a tower that SHOCKS the titans as they come into range with a click of the mouse, and add multiple ones together, and you got yourself a FORCEFIELD that will kill anything on your command!But maybe you don't wanna see towers shoot the titans from far away, maybe you wanna send DRONES in that get up close AAAAND personal, starting with tiny droids that mass produce very quickly and shoot faster than the basic blaster (Puts that blaster to SHAME), then going to BIGGER droids with bigger guns that act like a TANK for the tiny droids, but thats not all, upgrade the droids so the tiny ones have a better weapon and the bigger droids? OH boy lets say they get a WHOLE new weapon (Im not gonna spoil it, but lets say this weapon is DEADLY against anything really that doesn't have armor)With 5 planets to battle on (Earth, Moon, Mars, Saturn and Titan), the fighting never stops until you defeat the final boss on every planet leading to titan, each planet holds a new variety of titans, earth has your standard titans, moon moves onto armored titans that might force the blasters blasts to be defencless, so you gotta get better ones, mars has ghost titans that are unnoticable by regular blasters (Unless you get that certain upgrade that allows that to happen), so you must use the special shock towers to kill 'em, saturn has FLYING titans that will drop bombs on your towers, crazy isn't it? Titan however, has titans that will SHOOT your turrets from afar, as if titans dropping bombs from above wasn't bad enough, titans shooting your towers with armor will be your biggest problem.Again, the dificulty IS harsh, i mean this game will full on throw EVERYTHING at you every new level and the game kinda says ""Ok, so you got this thing, kill it, ok? Ok, have fun with that"" each new level, to a certain degree where it feels like its screaming ""HEY BTW WE GOT THIS NEW THING THAT YOUR TOTALLY GONNA HATE! HAVE FUN!"" all the way to the last level where it just says ""Well you know we can't be bothered to google the definition of mercy but were pretty sure it means you need to prepare yourself (before you rek yourself)""Yes i PROMISE there will be rage-quits, this game isn't exactly all easy otherwise i'd rather not review this game at all.I top my hat off to puppygames for creating a game that has variety and really pumps some love into a genre that i consider dead now (and tower defence games are my favourite :> )HOWEVER, i have to give 1 VERY big problem i have...And that is, there is a bug within the game that puppydog games just either flat out refuse to fix (on purpose) or just try to avoid it, seriously i mentioned this problem twice on the steam forums and all i got is halfway to knowing whats going on then...nothing else, and this problem is only apparent on steam apparently...[EDIT] BUT- The developer has managed to find a loophole with the steam cloud being disabled, while this 'problem' occurs if you have steam cloud enabled, just disable it and it'll work like a charm!WATCH A GAMEPLAY VIDEO I DID ON THIS GAME HERE:

												Ugh. Sometimes I hate the simple yes/no type of voting. If we're doing it that way I have to recomend this game, but truth is it gets way too hard way too fast and becomes frustrating.It's fairly standard tower defense. But there's a huge twist in that what you research and the money you collect on one level carries over to the next. So you must be extremely frugal in the early levels to have a shot at winning the later ones. If you didn't do that great say 5 levels ago that can snowball so quickly into a huge defeat later and you won't see it coming and have no recourse but to restart 5 levels back. It kinda sucks.But the retro styling is very cool and it's solid gameplay, although some research options need more explanation. Also super annoying is the stats for the guns are displayed when you first research them but not again later. The tooltips could be a lot better. I'd give this game 3/5 stars, not great, but fun and cheap when on sale.			",259,70,6,52,34,2,87

Product received for free
What Is Revenge of the Titans?Puppygames is a developer that I genuinely respect & appreciate because they intimately understand how to properly design & create vintage arcade-era retro-games on modern gaming platforms, in a way that is both immensely satisfying & true to form. In fact, they are one of the very few studios who do such games justice in my opinion because their sprite-based pixels feel innately alive and demonstrate a phenomenal sense of immersion for 2D graphics, brimming with a magnetic energy that pulls you right in and won't let go. Within their catalog on Steam, they currently offer 4 wonderful titles to choose from which are all highly acclaimed gems, whereby each shares a common style & aesthetic but features differing gameplay mechanics derived from their arcade counterparts. And these include: Titan Attacks, Ultratron, Droid Assault, and Revenge of the Titans - the latter of which shall be the focus of this review. GameplayThe Titans to be found here are your arch enemy from the sky, and these morbid monsters with their brightly glowing eyes have returned once more to Earth hell-bent on finishing up the job they started: destroying your prized bases. And there's so very many of them, myriads of waves in fact...marching toward you relentlessly in unison. That's because Revenge of the Titans caters specifically to tower defense fans, whereupon you have the ability to strategically build up a counter-attack in real-time using various clickr emplacements such as blaster turrets, explosives, battledroids, barricades, mines, and tangleweb...to name but just a few...each type offering its individual strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when choosing which is most optimal to use, as well as where it should be placed for maximum effectiveness. You'll have a finite amount of money to spend at any given time, and you will be purchasing these defenses and/or upgrades for them via an in-game economy...with collected funds being derived from nearby mining operations which you must set up and tend to continually so as to replenish your ability to engage in more purchases as needed to help stave off these enemies. Rest assured that the gameplay is indeed rather challenging...yet also with a refreshing level of depth to it...necessitating the ability to think fast on your feet in order to achieve maximum success. There is a tremendous element of tactical planning involved, especially when considering the wide array of different resource types available at your disposal in the bottom section of the screen.  And with a whopping 50 levels to overcome in the campaign alone, plus 5 different gameplay modes (standard campaign / easy campaign / endless / survival / sandbox user created content)...it is clear that countless hours of fun are to be found here without it ever becoming too monotonous in any way. I was certainly excited to reach the next successive wave after being awarded various goodies from the last, no matter how many I previously played. There's always new usable items and rewards being unlocked as you progress further in, which is a rather nice touch in facilitating a sense of progress being made the whole way through.GraphicsYou'll find that the bright vivid colours contrast beautifully against the black background in their games, and this one is no exception. Furthermore, you have the ability to drag the larger gameplay area around the screen so as to focus on certain sections of it as needed, which is a nice advantage to have...both in planning as well as combat. Additionally, there exists an optional shader effect which can be enabled, adding monitor scanlines plus a distortion effect...thus emulating the look and feel of an old-style arcade monitor so as to increase the sense of immersion. Personally, I was quite content to play without it though, but it's more a personal preference and allowing the user to choose their own is ideal.AudioWe all know how larger-than-life sound effects are such an integral aspect to these kinds of games, and in this one I'm delighted to report that you'll experience the most surreal auditory sensations. The electronic soundtrack as well as the synth it uses are simply sublime, hypnotizing you with its distinctive melody, while the thunderous explosions of these Titans being annhilated by your defenses will be sure to impress. Puppygames have got this down to a science - it's a definite hallmark of their titles.Steamified?It fully is, and includes both trading cards and many achievments to be unlocked.Verdict - 9/10As somebody who isn't even a die-hard fanatic of tower-defense type games, I was quite drawn in to this one nonetheless because of who it was made by. I knew it would be presented in a way that was both accessible and user-friendly (especially with the way in which it gradually teaches you the ropes as you go along via an in-game tutorial), while at the same time making me feel like I was playing the cousin game to Space Invaders (ie. Titan Attacks). It all exists in the same universe, and so after having completed that one already, it was only natural for me to try my hand at Revenge of the Titans as a follow-up experience. And I felt right at home instantly, soon mesmerized by the pew-pew sounds and complete obliteration of my foes. And the best part of all is that I had quite a fun time with it as expected...fully appreciating the robust strategy side to its gameplay, and even more, the allure of its premium presentation. I'll rate this one a 9/10Pros:- Wide assortment of defenses- Delightful synth soundtrack- Superb art style- Steam achievements + trading cards- Online LeaderboardsCons:- Monster paths can be difficult to gauge, a bit of guessing involved- Not a big fan of garbled voice effects in general For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com ",2037,735,85,132,116,17,145

												Revenge of the titans is a beautifully simplistic game. It brings everything you could ask for from a ""Tower defence"" type game, it doesn't try to pack itself full of unnecessary crap! This inide game is a joy to play quickly great buy for the price!			",51,0,0,7,7,0,1

												I played this before it was on Steam and I must say... by the time you left the Moon it got really really hard!Basically this is a Tower Defense game that you collect resources and kill everything before it reaches your base.Aftter each level ~ you can select a power up.    Looks awesome, plays awesome, and its really fun!   Originally the game was very difficult and unforgiving if you made any poor choices in power ups, but I've been informed that this has been changed to be more fair.  I had a good time playing it when it was difficult, but now it should be much better!			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												A retro Tower Defense casual game, maybe fine for portables, but it must be redesigned for Pc. The graphics are so minimalists that some differences, upgrades and texts are hard to see even in full screen. Effects are so annoying that is better deactivate them. Gives few time to building before a level start, spaces between buildings are uncertain, and no offers a full overview of scenaries. Foes can leave paths, march to anywhere and crush structures easily because weapons do little without power-ups, only a handfull are really usefull. Mining is low yield... A nightmare for defensive planning.			",308,48,0,52,30,1,96

												Never found a tower defence game i wanted to get into, but the art sytle on titan drew me in. I had a lot of fun playing threw this game and left wanting more... which is always a good thing. Sandbox mode allows you to play community made maps and create your own. I wanted this to be an extension to the game, it might still be, but I haven't found that there yet. I can't wait for a secound Revenge of the Titans, grab it if you can.			",204,74,0,32,9,2,19

The only thing that bugs me is that it's different from other Tower Defenses where the Enemies walk a path you see and can build around. I think this makes it pretty hard to tell where the enemies will walk. But aside from that I think this game is awesome!			",75,14,0,13,11,0,5

												Nice tower defense game. I am usually not a big fan of these, but this is a nice one. It has some twists on the normal tower defense in for example it does not have traditional maze building. You place your towers along the route of the emenies and not blocking them, else they will be destoyed quickly. Luckily the towers build instantly so you can place them as soon as you guestimate the route the enemies will take. The decent size research tree and enemy varienty keeps the levels fresh while your are going through the campaign. The difficulty level is not too frustratingly hard, while still giving you a proper challenge.It is not perfect though, the game explains the mechanics badly and you have to figure out (too) much yourself and the inability too zoom out of the map and not having a mini-map can make navigating and keeping an eye on the field a pain sometimes in having to pan the screen like mad.On a discount this game is definitely worth it.

												Revenge of the Titans brings new a huge and charming strategy game to the table, which can be dubbed as an achievement , considering the slowly flooding tower defense-genre. It defines itself with challenging gameplay, an amazing visual style, which results into a fast, intense and refreshing game. It's simple, well executed .If you're not bothered by a little trial and error with your research, it will be  good fun.The snowball effect of mistakes,shows the necessity to plan and build for specialized enemies at the cost of overall effectiveness. Thus its a worth well game if you are train your strategy abilitys			",51,13,2,5,9,1,11

After the introductory missions the enemies do not strictly follow a path and will actively move to avoid your defenses, so you can either turtle by your base, try to control the choke points, camp the spawn points or a combination of the approaches. Your resources (money) carries from level to level so if you are doing bad the later levels will be more rough. But saying that, most people don't realize the AI is adaptive so if your money is low the levels will be easier (and vise versa) - actually funny to read how some players cheated and gave themselves tons of money only to find that they could not kill the enemies because the difficulty was jacked up so much. Therefore, if you play within reason, I think the game always gives off a decent difficulty vibe.One negative I would agree with the others about is the lack of instructions - it can be daunting to figure out how to deal with the new enemy types but I think that as long as you have armor piercing turrets most of the rest is manageable. As a pro-tip, the laser with all the upgrades is overpowered and will help you out immensely. Also consider looking at some youtube videos on later levels to learn how to properly turtle - I think that it is the most effective approach in the end-game when enemies will rush you from 9-10 spawn points and evade defenses.Overall, I played this game for ~65 hours and got all of the achievements and I think it is pretty great hybrid TD/RTS game. I recommend giving it a shot if you are a fan of either genres. 9/10			",866,500,24,114,98,4,155

												Where to begin... the amazing art direction? The challenging, fast-paced gameplay? The fact that it is finally on Steam? Revenge of the Titans is an amazing blend of RTS and Tower defense genres, simple to understand, hard to master, beautiful to behold, complete with that great feeling when you finally complete a diabolically hard mission.Constantly juggling between managing your resources, placing new turrets in optimal configurations, manually reloading and picking powerups, and selling unneeded stuff can be pretty hectic and pretty entertaining.The singleplayer campaign has a bunch of stuff you can research in between missions, making you choose between different playing styles- a lot of weak but cheap turrets? Or a few powerful ones? What enhancements do you want to build? Will you research those heavy blasters immediately or invest into a longer research that will pay off in the long run?All in all, a great RTS/Tower defense hybrid game- I definitely recommend it.

												Great graphics and great production quality.  Enemies don't follow rigid paths so you're constantly on your toes. Lots of stuff to do in this game, great replayability. Controls are great and very intuitive. Love the art style. If this is on sale, it's a must-buy.One Minute Review:

												Revenge of the Titans is a 2D tower defense game with RTS elements developed by London-based studio Puppy Games. As in all tower defense games, your goal is to halt the oncoming horde of enemies by strategically placing defensive towers that destroy them. In this case, humanity is being attacked by aliens coming from Saturn’s largest moon Titan.The campaign spans 50 missions across 5 locations (Earth, The Moon, Mars, Saturn and Titan). After you’re done with the 10-hour campaign, you can spend more time with the game in the Endless, Survival and Sandbox modes. There’s a good amount of content here. If you’ve played a classic tower defense game, Revenge of the Titans will feel pretty familiar. However, what separates this game from the usual suspects are the subtle yet profound base building and resource gathering elements found in traditional RTS games.Every map starts with just your base which you have to protect from the Titans. Then you have to build factories that mine crystals in order to make money to be able to purchase other buildings and towers. You also have additional buildings at your disposal such as shield generators, cloaking devices, reloaders, etc. All of these can be unlocked over time in the research screen before every mission. After completing each mission you are awarded with a single research point. Apart from buildings and towers, you can research technological advancements which bring their own benefits to the table. The great thing about the research system is that you can re-spec the entire system before each mission. This enables you to try out different tactics and you will need certain towers and abilities when facing a particular enemy.Enemies come in a pretty large variety of shapes and sizes and certain missions also throw huge bosses at you which can be very challenging. Certain towers are good for certain enemies, that’s where the research screen comes into play. You need to pay attention as to what types of enemies are coming so that you can choose the appropriate towers and technologies otherwise you’ll have a pretty hard time finishing a mission.The game will also randomly distribute power ups and cash bonuses during missions which you will need to manually pick up on the map within a limited time frame. There’s also a tower that needs to be used against a certain enemy that you have to manually control. Coupled with the base/add-on/tower building, the situation can get pretty hectic at times and certain elements such as the power up pick ups simply come off as an artificial way to increase the action. It impeded on the strategic element and just feels needlessly overbearing.That said, Revenge of the Titans nails the addictive and tactical core that makes tower defense games so satisfying. And with the RTS twist, it manages to differentiate itself which is really important as the genre is becoming increasingly crowded. It’s a good title for newcomers and veterans alike.7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)			",117,87,1,22,18,0,33

												Generally, a principle feature of tower defense games is that the enemies stay on paths so that you have to think about where to place your structures.  In this game, enemies just swarm you and setting up is a matter of guesswork, which throws out any strategy besides ""put down lots of guns and hope it works"".   What really didn't help was the voices of the characters that popped up after every mission and research project.  Listening to their ""BLUH BLUH BLAH BLUH"" was like a mosquito cheese grating my ear canal and quickly killed any drive I had to keep playing.			",132,28,0,10,6,1,13

												I don't care whether you like tower defence or not, whether you loath it with every fibre of your being. BUY THIS GAME. AND THE SOUNDTRACK. If all you get out of it is the soundtrack, you've come out ahead.The game itself is good, but listening to the soundtrack for the first time outside of the game my knees went weak. It's phenomanally good, and should be a lesson to people on how to chiptune, how to re-interpret famous classical music, and how to choose music for your soundtrack.			",620,157,8,117,44,5,118

												First of all haven't even beat the moon, but im in love with this game.Yes the gameplay could be better and yes it gets kinda boring after a while but its so unique andspecial, I used a 90%- off coupon and got it for a dollar and for me even 10 dollars would be ok.if you took SuperCrateBox and made it 10x better and gave it a story this would be it.(and added a bunch more stuff)Recommended			",36,3,0,2,5,0,12

												I do not understand the large number of positive reviews for this. Okay, I'll admit: the graphics, styling and sound are all great. However, the actual gameplay is... confusing? There doesn't seem to be much point. Just mindless clicking to put down lots of towers and before you know it the stage is complete. Where's the strategy? I don't get it. Buy it for 99 cents or less if that's ever possible. The dialogue in the cut-scenes made me laugh.			",83,26,3,1,1,0,17

												I tried to like this but after giving it several attempts I can't say I do. The RTS/tower defense hybrid just doesn't work for me. It's very difficult but that difficulty feels cheap and unfair. Too many random conditions and the AI doesn't follow easily definable rules. If there were some rogue-like elements that let you build upon your failures that would do a lot for this game, but as it is I can't recommend it.			",117,41,0,28,7,0,14

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Revenge of the Titans 

			Views: 10		

			The Titans have been a real pain in the butt if they aren't attacking they are revenging. This time the humans are taking the tower defense route to solve the problem of the titans.		

The Titans have been a real pain in the butt if they aren't attacking they are revenging.  This time the humans are taking the tower defense route to solve the problem of the titans.Build offensive turrets buff them with technology while defending your base and resource gathering buildings.  Between each round research new tech to keep up with the ever stronger waves of foes.The game oozes style and has a good sprinkling of humor, however the core gameplay falls short.  To make it to the end of the campaign be prepared to repeat levels over and over to optimize your play.  If the gameplay lived up to the style this would be one of the best tower defense games out there.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												Revenge of the Titans is a really good game. It is challenging yet addictive. With over 5+ planets you can explore (each increasing in difficulty), you can always replay the game. If you do not like your skill tree, there is a neat little Refund button to reset your skill tree. (Don't worry you keep your points XD). Although it lacks in story, it is a neat little game which I strongly suggeest everyone plays :)-Le Overlord			",177,7,1,13,12,3,8

												For $10 I expect a hell of a lot more than this.This is a depthless tower defense game. The only thing that's even slightly unusual about it is that it doesn't use a grid for tower placement.

												I usually hate tower defense games, but this one is just different enough to be worth a look. Researching weapons and gaining manual control over your towers adds an RTS feel to it, and it looks fantastic. The downside is that it's very easy to screw up your research or spend too much cash and be crippled in later levels, but with some experimentation it's simple to figure out.			",175,20,4,23,7,0,19

There's no single way to win a map, and that's the thing I like the most.			",560,131,22,91,78,6,93

												I do like this game...however I do not like it as much as I thought I would.  Its not to say its a bad game, oh no no no, its actually pretty decent, just I feel it suffers from some oversights.Basically you have to defend your base from the oncoming hoards of Titans, using what ever you have researched and are available.  Ok simple enough.  You get an icon showing the direction the hoards are coming from and you build accordingly.  Just on some missions, during my play time, I find that an all important hoard direction marker is actually hidden/obscured by my HUD, which lead to my defences getting demolished because I didnt see said marker.But really...tis a minor gripe, if annoying.  The actual gameplay is pretty simple, just point and click to deploy your stuff or click and drag for multiples, so nice and easy to get your defences where you need them/want them to be.  Research is pretty easy to understand with icons showing what needs what to be available, though the game does tend to recommend tech to you if you havent got it, so it kinda takes it out of your hands a bit, by basically saying "" you need this, not what you are currently thinking ""  Though you can ignore that.  But it does offer you respec points for your research so you can get what you want within you resorce point limit at the time, so thats a pretty useful feature.Graphically I like it, its a nice and different style to see.  I particulary like how the Titans are designed, especially the sub-bosses.  But one other thing that gets me is the price.  I would not pay the £7 it was advertised for.  Fun fact, I recieved a 90% off this game coupon from Steam by crafting a badge, so I had it for 70p!  So what I would do, if this game interests you, is get a coupon or wait for it to come on sale at around 33% off at minimum and then I would say its worth it.Not a bad game, just a few little issues and a bit over-priced, but it is alright.  Should cure your Tower Defence itch for a little while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun Tower Defense-esque game with a few twists.Basically you have a good selection of weapons and upgrades, and enemy type is fairly varied. The biggest difference between this and most Tower Defense games is that the enemies don't always follow the same path; sometimes they follow roads that give them movement speed boosts, but other times they will try avoiding your turrets or going straight for your vulnerable structures.

												This game is an interesting one for me.  I enjoy a lot of aspects of it, but it can be frustrating in many ways too.  Defends your base against hordes of monsters, research 1 new tech every stage for 30+ stages, and try to earn money by mining crystals during each round.Problem is the game gets HARDER the more money, resources, and powerups you stockpile.  I've experienced weird reactive AI where the game seemingly punishes certain turret placement because of a system of perceived threat -- Enemies will skirt your turret range and go around you!  Building vertically is superior to horizontal, so some maps are just frustrating to build on.  It ends up feeling like a race against the impossible as things get harder, so you must do better, but by doing so things get harder still.  That being said, I've never beaten the game because a recent patch broke my old save I think, so I had to start over.  I don't know how the end half of the game goes.Good aesthetics and music too.

												This quite a good tower defense game. It's not a strict-pathing one, where there's a grid and you can easily decide what routes the enemies will take. This one is free-form. The aliens come from designates spots, but can take various paths to get to their objectivs.The upgrade system is quite large and interesting, as there are definite paths through the upgrade tree.The graphics and sound have a really cool retro vibe to them. There are several modes to play, and many hours of fun to be had.The levels (that I've encountered so far) don't have a super-nitpicky quality to them. I'm referring to those moments in other TDs where you say to yourself, ""If that one alien had died, I'd have had that extra $10 to buy that tower that would have kept me alive."" You really get the feeling that it's your overall strategy that determines whether you win or lose.			",41,6,0,2,11,0,5

												An awesome tower defense game, which hase a nice artstyle and fun gameplay. Kind of cute, somehow with nice music. Definetly worth checking out as a fan of tower defense games. Not perfect, though. Read those negative reviews, because they are quite right as well. I like this game and recommend it to thers.			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

												I like tower defenses games but in this game some parts ruining this for me. First some positives I love visuals of this game and amount of upgrades but there are lots of things I don't like. Upgrades are not very well designed, first of all you need upgrade one part of technology to upgrade another bot often you ended up looking from one icon to another and compare to see what you need do first to make another step closer to thing you want to do, tree based upgrade system would solve this in no time. Another thing is that you don't have enough information what upgrade give you, some give you only option to upgrade another items but some give you +1 damage, armor or something like that but you din't know it until you actually get this upgrade and get some more information with this.Gameplay- well this is not classic tower defense, you can place tower anywhere and enemies also coming from general directions of pointer not exact point and can walk freely. not on specific path, so this make it harder to make strategic decisions and you have to react quickly to what is happening on map and you don't have active pause to do so. Camera shakes, glitches and other visuals effects sometimes make chaos on screen and I turned it off quite quickly. You can zoom out and in bigger maps this would be very, very helpful to see better situation on battlefield especially when you can pause and move to different parts of map.  Another thing is adaptive difficulty setting and transferring money from one level to another, this is interesting, in theory sound good but in real life scenario not always work as should, if you do good in one level your reward will be that next one will be harder, sometimes much harder than it should be. And money transfer from one level to another can cause that in next level you will have barely any money if you do exceptional bad in last one but still finished it.And lastly after some time it all feel the same, levels are generated randomly but due its random nature and way you can place towers and how enemies can walk freely it feel very similar and repetitive. Ans there are some more tings I can complain but I think this is enough to decide if this is game for you or not.			",720,331,27,78,67,8,111

												When this game came out you could only respec by going back and replaying several levels back... for instance, if I needed a particular tower for a level but I was off in the research tree by three points I had to go back three levels to respec for the tower I needed to beat that level, only to find out that choice would not allow me to have a tower I needed for the next level making it impossible to continue wihout going back and picking another tree all over again.I put up with this a while, but it became so frustrating I quit, as did my buddy who picked up the game at the same time.Since then they patched in the ability to change what you've researched and respec at any time. Too late, I already hate this game and the people who made it. If you came along afterwards you may not understand how I feel or why, and you may very well get some enjoyment out of this game.

												This game is not for the casual player. this game be quite hard and the element that what you end with as currency in a level is the amount you start the next one can cause alot of frustration. another thing is that the Titans actually Learn later on. the more intelligent titans will actually start to try to walk around your defenses or even concentrate to get your more powerfull defenses. luckily you get many tools like drone factories,heavy weapons, and even some tactical tools like a scarecrow and the decoy to controll the flow of titans. but beware for the ones that are more determined.this game can be very challenging sometimes and the research tree is kinda of a trial and error thing, but it only makes the game even better.

												A casual approach to the tower defense genre. I've played the crap out of the Humble Store release of Revenge of the Titans, and continue to enjoy it. For those who find tower defense games a bit too tedius, Revenge of the Titans may just be your bag. Mission layouts are simple. Units are simplified and easy to manage. Upgrades are comprehensive and fun to experiment with. Enemy units are easy to figure out and fun to battle. All-in-all, Revenge of the Titans gives tower defense newbies a decent handle on the genre's mechanics.Tower defense veterans will probably be put off Revenge of the Titans simplified approach. However, every gaming genre needs a quality title with a low barrier to entry. For the tower defense genre, Revenge of the Titans is precisely that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an awesome tower defense game. The interesting mix of power-up, upgrades and new weapons have to be selected carefully for the successful completion of challenging levels.  The laser and droids are particularly damaging.  The balance between opposing forces is very tight.  The chances of being over-run by those nasty Titans is great, especially during a ghost swarm.  Recent versions have improved greatly the access to the technology tree with a single upgrade now available at the end of all campaign levels.  I'm not too into retro graphics but I really like the level introductions, animations and sound effects. 8/10			",106,16,0,2,12,0,24

												I don't usually dig tower defense type games, however I picked this up as part of the humble indy game bundle and discovered that Revenge of the Titans is NOT your typical tower defense.  The research trees are complex enough to really make you think about your choices in the long term.  You also carry your cash from level to level with the ability to go back to a previous point and start from that previous area.  This is a brilliant design decision, because if you get stuck, its so easy to go back to try to clear a level better for more cash, or to research down a different tree.  The non-boxy placement of turrets and mappy levels are reminiscent of warcraft and starcraft, which turns out to be a good thing as placement stays dynamic, and you scroll around the map to keep up with the battle and grab powerups.Basically this is non-tower defensey tower defense, and the game is far better for it.

												Fun sci-fi tower defenceThe story is somewhat simple. Basically, aliens (titans) are invading earth and it's your job to stop them. Gameplay revolves around classical tower defence cliche's with sum bonuses. Basically there is one campaign to play and you unlock levels as you win them. The aim is to protect your factory from being destroyed. You have a limited number of towers you can place on the field, in order to defend your factory (which has limited health). When your factory is destroyed you immeditely lose the game. As you win each level, the money you earned gets tranfered to the next level. Furthermore, as you progress though the story you earn points which you can use to buy new towers, walls and other buildings. There are a variety of towers available including lasers, plasma, support anti- air. All towers will have limited ammo and will have to spend time to recharge again. Towers may be upgraded when clicking on them and spending resources (ie. money). You collect money by building resource gathering buildings. there are a wide variety of enemies including (strong-weak) land and air units. In some levels you will be facing a boss which requires clever placement of towers to destroy. You can aslo call upon limited abilities to assist in the defence such as bombs and fire-rate boost. defeated enemies may drop money or abilities to use later. The game lasted me 12,7 hours so it's decently long, plus you can replay levels after you beat them.Audio serves the game well. Weapon fire sounds vary between lazers and other weapons. The sounds also help invoke a strong sci-fi, yet cartoony feel to the game (ie. less serious), Other sounds such as alarms are clear and crisp to help warn you of attacks at your base. Dialogue is spoken through text boxes only and there is no audio. There is also a survival mode besides the campaign which tests how long you can last. If your looking for a good tower defence game get this NOW!			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Frustration!! This game despite the cute and simple premise of a tower defense game is extremely hard. You'll get to level 40 and realised you didn't save enough money from the first few levels to pass. Whilst it was fun to get there, there is little incentive for me to go back and save the extra $100 per level just so I have that $4,000 I can pass level 40. Challenging and somewhat fun.. I recommend Orcs Must Die over this as a tower defense game 5/10			",125,24,0,25,18,1,23

Love the art style throughout the entire game. The technology tree is also very nice and a great addition that compliments the game well. The campaign is nice and difficult and the challenges on the side give some decent replay-ability. I only wish that I could play co-op with a friend because that would be amazing in this.

												This is a great game to waste time with, beautiful graphic style, and fun. Perfect mix of retro and modern. It is a bit faster paced than most tower defense games but that is one of the best parts. It is not boring after 10 minutes or more. I don't like tower defense games that allow you to pause and take your time to plan moves, I would rather have to learn to make faster decisions on the fly. I am a bit biased as I happen to like all Puppygames. I have played this game on my another computer and had to finally purchase a copy for myself on Steam. Also if you have a retail copy puppygames will send you a steam key if you want to play on Steam. Most other company's wont do that for their customers,  if you want to play a game you bought from them on Steam you will have to buy another copy on Steam, like Epic Games.There is a learning cure but not too long and the visuals are great, also like all Puppygames there is some great audio. A fun game that wont put you to sleep and doesn't cost too much. Check out the community discussions you can always find coupons for their games for a deep discount if your not sure the cost is right. Check out all their games you will be sure to find something interesting.			",387,36,3,13,19,2,31

												If you're really into tower defense games, this is definitely one to check out. This one's a little more on the hardcore end of the tower defense spectrum I think, pretty chaotic with enemies coming from a lot of directions, and the build/upgrade tree is challenging to grasp at first. The ZX Spectrum robot is a fun retro throwback for those across the pond, but it's too bad that the sandbox mode is a paid DLC.			",182,59,5,26,16,4,49

												I don't usually dig tower defense type games, however I picked this up as part of the humble indy game bundle and discovered that Revenge of the Titans is NOT your typical tower defense.  The research trees are complex enough to really make you think about your choices in the long term.  You also carry your cash from level to level with the ability to go back to a previous point and start from that previous area.  This is a brilliant design decision, because if you get stuck, its so easy to go back to try to clear a level better for more cash, or to research down a different tree.  The non-boxy placement of turrets and mappy levels are reminiscent of warcraft and starcraft, which turns out to be a good thing as placement stays dynamic, and you scroll around the map to keep up with the battle and grab powerups.Basically this is non-tower defensey tower defense, and the game is far better for it.

												This is a great game to waste time with, beautiful graphic style, and fun. Perfect mix of retro and modern. It is a bit faster paced than most tower defense games but that is one of the best parts. It is not boring after 10 minutes or more. I don't like tower defense games that allow you to pause and take your time to plan moves, I would rather have to learn to make faster decisions on the fly. I am a bit biased as I happen to like all Puppygames. I have played this game on my another computer and had to finally purchase a copy for myself on Steam.

												Fun sci-fi tower defenceThe story is somewhat simple. Basically, aliens (titans) are invading earth and it's your job to stop them. Gameplay revolves around classical tower defence cliche's with sum bonuses. Basically there is one campaign to play and you unlock levels as you win them. The aim is to protect your factory from being destroyed. You have a limited number of towers you can place on the field, in order to defend your factory (which has limited health). When your factory is destroyed you immeditely lose the game. As you win each level, the money you earned gets tranfered to the next level. Furthermore, as you progress though the story you earn points which you can use to buy new towers, walls and other buildings. There are a variety of towers available including lasers, plasma, support anti- air. All towers will have limited ammo and will have to spend time to recharge again. Towers may be upgraded when clicking on them and spending resources (ie. money). You collect money by building resource gathering buildings. there are a wide variety of enemies including (strong-weak) land and air units. In some levels you will be facing a boss which requires clever placement of towers to destroy. You can aslo call upon limited abilities to assist in the defence such as bombs and fire-rate boost. defeated enemies may drop money or abilities to use later. The game lasted me 12,7 hours so it's decently long, plus you can replay levels after you beat them.Audio serves the game well. Weapon fire sounds vary between lazers and other weapons. The sounds also help invoke a strong sci-fi, yet cartoony feel to the game (ie. less serious), Other sounds such as alarms are clear and crisp to help warn you of attacks at your base. Dialogue is spoken through text boxes only and there is no audio. There is also a survival mode besides the campaign which tests how long you can last. If your looking for a good tower defence game get this NOW!			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Very fun game, its like a tower defense kind of style to it, and you upgrade, obtain new towers through each battle. I literally spend around 10 minutes after each battle trying to figure what to advance in tech or get a tower. The money you obtain with battles fallow throughout the whole singleplayer; adds a new twist to not going crazy and thinking of where towers are needed most. And another interesting idea, is that often the titans will take the roads, but they are not dependant on them (as in they will go around). They are pretty much trying to make it to your base asap. taking the roads makes them a bit faster. I have not thoroughly finished singleplayer yet, but I generally got the idea of this game. Very nice for some casual gameplay or roadtrips. And has a survival and endless.9/10 ",271,61,8,26,26,5,62

												I do like this game...however I do not like it as much as I thought I would.  Its not to say its a bad game, oh no no no, its actually pretty decent, just I feel it suffers from some oversights.Basically you have to defend your base from the oncoming hoards of Titans, using what ever you have researched and are available.  Ok simple enough.  You get an icon showing the direction the hoards are coming from and you build accordingly.  Just on some missions, during my play time, I find that an all important hoard direction marker is actually hidden/obscured by my HUD, which lead to my defences getting demolished because I didnt see said marker.But really...tis a minor gripe, if annoying.  The actual gameplay is pretty simple, just point and click to deploy your stuff or click and drag for multiples, so nice and easy to get your defences where you need them/want them to be.  Research is pretty easy to understand with icons showing what needs what to be available, though the game does tend to recommend tech to you if you havent got it, so it kinda takes it out of your hands a bit, by basically saying "" you need this, not what you are currently thinking ""  Though you can ignore that.  But it does offer you respec points for your research so you can get what you want within you resorce point limit at the time, so thats a pretty useful feature.Graphically I like it, its a nice and different style to see.  I particulary like how the Titans are designed, especially the sub-bosses.  But one other thing that gets me is the price.  I would not pay the £7 it was advertised for.  Fun fact, I recieved a 90% off this game coupon from Steam by crafting a badge, so I had it for 70p!  So what I would do, if this game interests you, is get a coupon or wait for it to come on sale at around 33% off at minimum and then I would say its worth it.Not a bad game, just a few little issues and a bit over-priced, but it is alright.  Should cure your Tower Defence itch for a little while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hohoho! I had this game from a Humble Indie Bundle and never did try it until I saw it was up for an Xmas Winter Achievement (2011), so I played it. And you know what, it's great. Face off against waves of enemy titans and build up your defences in order to protect your base. It's like the usual RTS game in which you need to build refineries in order to save up money and then place turrets slowly along the path the titans take to reach your base. It's really great, I loved it. It's very retro with it's 16bit visuals but when the pace gets going it really does get hectic. If you're still not sure, check out some gameplay on YouTube or something, but I'd recommend it.WHY ELSE WOULD I BE WRITING HERE... well... no that doesn't make sense. A recommendation should be something positive as you want others to buy I do have other recommendations that are negative. Lol, counter-intuitive? Bleh. I should go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's sorta fun, but read the strategy guides first: it is entirely possible to make a critical error early on in the game that you simply cannot recover from without going back 10-11 levels to correct it.			",422,170,4,70,44,0,53
