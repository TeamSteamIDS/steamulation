												I really liked the first Majesty and played it for dozens of hours (back before I had steam... now I have Majesty Gold and Majesty Gold HD for some reason). This is a very competent sequel to a great game. It iterated on a couple things and changed a few things that were already established but all in all it was a pretty good game.Pros:-Great fantasy sim type game. I don't know of many games like it where you recruit heroes but don't control them.-The added party system is my favorite thing by far to come from the sequel.-The graphical update to the series was well done.Cons:-The difficulty can easily spike and you can't recover from lost heroes. You will have to restart the mission and it can be frustrating.-I don't like what they did with temples; you can only build them on certain holy sites. I prefered Majesty where you could build them where ever but building one temple would lock out other temples.I would certainly recommend this game. Especially for people who were fans of the original. I certainly was and I like the sequel a lot. I would also recommend picking up the orignal.			",188,34,3,58,73,1,69

												As I see most of reviews here are written by first Majesty fans. I've never played first part and started with Majesty 2 and this review will be for people who just want to know if that's a good game.As you can see I played 50 hours in that game, so this should be some clue. And I need to add that wasn't wasted time for me. Because this is just a great game. It's RTS but works little different to typical in that genre. As a king you show what needs to be done and your heroes will do it on their own, sooner or later. This little difference made this game totally different than other games in the genre.For me that game was quite difficult, but I'm not a RTS expert.VERDICT:If you like to be a fantasy king, this is the chance to that dream come true.If you're a RTS fan, you should play that game. Especially of the difference I mentioned before.Like this review?

												Sean Connery is the Alfred to your Bruce as you reclaim Wayne Enterprises by crushing foes with your wallet circa 1200 AD.I regret not initially buying the collection including all the DLC for this funny game. I learned that a good king is rich or dead.You need buildings so forget about those trees around your castle. They don't matter.Monsters are hitting your buildings but don't jump at the chance to revive that fully equipped hero. It is costly and the next tax collection is in 30 seconds. Let him rest. He won't even buy anything when he comes back to life.Hire new heroes. Although weak and poorly equipped, they will eagerly respond to a fistful of your gold.Deny them a healer. Their gold will be spent on your red health potions and armor or they will end up in your graveyard.Discard humanity, gain power. Pretty solid royalty simulator.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my fondest gaming memories was starting up Majesty 2 for the first time. My wife was out visiting family, I had the whole evening to myself, and a bottle of wine to pass it with. I spent hours building little kingdoms, glass in hand, shouting at my little virtual peasants like the tin-pot monarch I've always dreamed of being. Needless to say it was a magical evening, but much like the hangover I nursed the next day, Majesty 2 turned out to be far more trouble than I expected.Just as the classic that spawned it did, Majesty 2 casts you as the sovereign ruler of a fantasy kingdom, beset by all manner of foul beasts. In each scenario you build a settlement out from your keep, consisting of inns, markets, guilds, and workshops, all in the service of enticing heroes to your cause. As king, you can't take on evil directly, but you can hire mercenaries to do all the dirty work for you. The result is a real-time strategy game with very little direct input, aside from constructing your town.You do have two tools at your disposal to direct your little champions, though. As king you can place bounties on monsters or dungeons to reward those who conquer them, or on locations to encourage exploration. Your tiny heroes are more inclined to go for larger bounties, which you pay from the taxes and profits from your markets and shops. It's a clever economy, with your heroes collecting gold to spend in your town, which you then use to expand and place your bounties. There are plenty of new units and upgrades to use as well, which will be refreshing to veterans of the first game, as well as a new party system for making more effective groups of heroes.What isn't so refreshing is the difficulty curve. Like I said, my first evening with Majesty 2 was amazing. The introductory levels do a fantastic job of bringing you up to speed on managing a kingdom. Your heroes will level up and conquer the maps for you, and you'll feel like good King Henry himself living large on your victories and riches. But not a dozen maps into the game, the wheels come completely off. You'll start running into scenarios where dragons ravage your town without any recourse, or hordes of monsters descend on your keep before you can field any experienced heroes. It's an incredible brick wall of frustration to smash into after such a promising start, but even with the open scenario map there's no way around it. After a certain point, every map is an uphill struggle against absurd waves of enemies.It's a colossal shame, too, because if not for the crushing difficulty Majesty 2 would be a huge improvement on the formula. The interface is cleaner, the upgrades are more varied, there's better balance to the defensive buildings (assuming a reasonable challenge), and the presentation is excellent. The look of the game cribs a bit from Warcraft III in a good way, with detailed 3D models and buildings. I really enjoyed the sound design in particular, with some rousing music and a hilariously not-Sean-Connery narrator. But alas, 'tis all for naught if you can barely beat even the middling scenarios. I wish I could recommend Majesty 2 as strongly as I do the first, but the fact is that you're not going to get more than two or three hours out of it before it pummels you into uninstalling.

												This game is terrible. Anything you may have liked about the first Majesty has been changed for the worse or altogether taken out of the game; I'd make a list, but it would take entirely too long. Big defects of this game:-AI is terrible. Characters hang around the castle area more often, accomplishing nothing. Flags do little to motivate and when they actually manage to catch the attention of a hero, the hero usually rushes to his death - they are either too stupid to run away or, more likely, one of the  unimaginative monsters are overpowered and heroes have no chance against it.-Stories are poorly thought out or are nearly the same as quests found in the first game. It seemed that the developers focused more on the mildly humurous jokes made by the advisor/narrator and less on anything novel or interesting for former Majesty fans. Even if you could get past the monotony of the quests, there are only a handful of quests available.-Finally, the largest problem in my opinion is the fact that every quest other than the tutorial, regardless of the supposed difficulty, is nearly impossible to beat without finding loopfole or cheap trick to finish th mission. Now, I'm not saying it's annoying because it's a difficult game, I'm saying that I have repeately run into situations where, had I not already attempted the quest several times, I would have had no chance of surviving regardless of the tactics or steps taken. Amost every quest I've played allows you a mere minute before waves of rats, skeletons or even more powerful creatures bombard your town. If you manage to take care of them, there's bound to be another directly after that one. Basically, every monster spawning point continously creates monsters who, instead of wandering aimlessly as was seen in the original Majesty, run directly toward your town to assault buildings or heroes. The sheer amounts of these monsters is astounding. And after a small number of in-game days, your city will be filled with sewers and a graveyard that also spawn large numbers of monsters. Basically, these monsters that aren't even a part of the mission's plotline truly ruin the mission at hand and cause the player to focus on defending the city for the majority of quest. Only once EVERY creature spawn point has been destroyed can a player even BEGIN to focus on the quest itself. Tha game seems like it was thrown together with little thought put in to the story or the ease of playing the game; I wouldn't be surprised if I found out that it was never even tested before release. I know this review probably just sounds like the rants of a noob who can't deal with the difficulty of the game, but I honestly think that this is one of the worst games I've ever played. Actually, writing this review has gotten me so worked up, I think I AM going to list all of the problems, little and small, that I've found so far:-Poor Artificial Intelligence-Too many monsters to deal with -always attack your town- The quests are nearly the same quests found in the original game- Few things are explained or have tips; If you haven't played the first one, you probably won't know what is going on- Fewer buildings and types of heroes- Can't control which buildings should be taxed/ repaired- Many areas of the map cannot be built on - No apparent reason.- There is no more ""seriousness"" to the plotline as told by the advisor. Everything is a less than hilarious joke, usually about the same apparent alcoholism the narrator suffers from.- Everything in the game has a cartoonish/ childish look to them-Quest opening screens scroll through seemingly unrelated and aesthetically displeasing screenshots- Player can only build a limited number of buildings of a given type. This means a limited amount of income and heroes-Only one marketplace; Trading posts can only be built in predetermined areas. - Every quest about a single, powerful monster (Giant, dragon, etc.) begins with them attacking your town with no chance to prepare. They then continue to raid our town without relent.- All enemies are incredibly powerful against buildings. A rat/skeleton or two can take down several buildings if unattended.- Heroes do nothing on their own: Ranger do no explore anymore, rogues don't steal/ collect chests, warriors no longer hunt, clerics (healers) rarely follow and heal people, dwarves don't build (gnomes don't exist as far as a I know), elves no longer bring in lots of money, etc. - There is a ""party"" option which is supposed to aloow you to keep a group of four heroes together, however I could never get the party to accomplish anything of worth.- The ONLY way to make a decent amount of money is to search for trading post areas, build trading posts and hope that they aren't destroyed during or after the building process (Which they most definitely will be).- Buildings are weak (or, as mentioned above, the monsters destroy them very quickly.- Poor attempt at a map editor (too much too explain)- Camera views are awful - Can't zoom out very far- Camera panning controls are slow- Live cutscenes will interrupt any action you are currently doing- Sewers pop up often and spawn at least three rats at a time in the center of your town- Many quests require you to convince heroes to go to a certain location on the map. The only way is to use an explore/ defend flag which tend to only attract rangers and rogues- Rogues are melee and incredibly weak- The same hero spells/ improvements have to be researched at every building - not a central one such as a library- ""His Majesty's"" spells can also be researched multiple times if accidentall clicked, accomplishing nothing but loss of gold- Annoying voice actors- Many buildings/monsters have no description-I've played 6 quests and still can't build many of the buildings- As new buildings/ heroes are introduced, they're purposes are not always clear or explained- There is no explanation to what upgrading a building does. I'm sure there are many more issues I could find or have forgotton to list, but I'm done. Once again, don't expect anything fun or exciting if you decide to buy this game. I am most likely never going to run the game again; my interest in Majesty 2 has died as quickly as it started.			",39,10,0,6,3,0,11

												A good enough game, has it's own share of problems with gameplay, but the biggest thing is the fact that it's not majesty, it's not a spiritual successor to the first game, heroes will hardly do anything but wonder around like monkeys, without a purpose unless u entice them. Gone is the time were heroes whould wonder around slaying beasts, and raiding lairs, rangers exploring the wilderness on their own. Infact i can say majesty 1 is still superior to this game through the fact that the heroes there also varied in inteligence among other things. Still, this game can be pretty fun, and if it's on sale it is worth it.			",42,14,1,17,17,0,22

												Right, so first of all a few things. I hardly ever write reviews but I felt like for all the negative reviews this game received, I have to defend it because, this is in fact a REALLY REALLY GOOD GAME!!! In fact, it's a game that I can't get bored with and do you know why, because unlike any other games, it's different every single time I play it!!!To those, who said steam DLCs don't work, that's rubbish, it might be a personal isssue, I have all DLCs and the all work, I bought them 1 by 1, my brother bought the pack and it works for both of us (plus, I know a lot of other people whom it works perfectly on steam), so that's that...Not saying there isn't an issue, there might be, but please, don't state they don't work when they do for a lot of us!Although, you guys are probably right, in terms of comparing it to Majesty 1, yes it probably sucks. Don't know, I've never played Majesty 1, but I'd liek to make a point: for those, who haven't played Majesty one, I'd still recommend this game, you will not regret it, I promise, if you liked Dune 2/C&C/Dungeon Keeper, etc, you will like this, however, this will be different, but in a positive way :D!What I love in this game is that your heroes have their own will. I absolutely, don't agree with someone who said they don't do anything unless there's a flag prompting them to do it. Your heroes are interested in different things, the Barbarian is aggressive, the Paladin is rather defensive. The archer likes to kill animal type of monsters and theives are adventorous. There's a lot to this game and it feels like a lot of people played a few maps, didn't get what the game meant to do and just wrote a negative review because it's not like Majesty 1.This game is really-really challenging and fun at the same time. I don't have any issues with restarting a map or reloading it, to me that's how all games shoudl be where you need to think about what you've done wrong and correct your mistake. At some point, I've had like 8-10 saves at different times on the same map so that I could restart if need be. And every single time I reload a map it never goes the same way because your heroes will behave differently. That's what gives the beauty of this game, what you can control is how strong they can get, give them missions, spend money on them and they'll give you more money back. To those, who have said this game is impossible to complete, both my brother and myself have completed the full game including DLCs and yes, we've replayed multiple maps before completed them but that's the whole point. If you only like complete a game at the first go, then you really shoudln't play with strategy games!!!To me this game is one of the best, I have ever played. It is a shame for sure that they took out some creatures and buildings but liek I've said, I've never played M1 so to me this game is perfect!!!!10/10 Please, try yourself, don't listen to the negative comments, this game is worth every penny!!!! I really hope, there will be a Majesty 3!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original Majesty game was great fun and occasionally challenging, then comes Majesty 2 which breaks the entire concept and turns it into a frustrating mess where trial and error are par for each repetitive level.   The biggest problems with Majesty 2 is the fact that the game is exceptionally grindy for a so-called Fantasy Kingdom Sim...which it isn't at all. You can barely get a minutes breath without being constantly attacked by swarms of monsters attacking you from every angle, whilst your so called heroes are usually all dimwitted or just plain greedy especially when a high level monsters appear, and it doesn't take long for some nasty ones to appear....base defenses are completely useless, they are destroyed extremely fast so most missions are really only beatable if you zerg - zerg - zerg all the objectives as soon as possible, any focus on building your kingdom is a waste of time and ultimately will cause you to lose as soon wave after wave of ever increasingly difficult monsters start attacking your town. The biggest and most game breaking issue with Majesty 2 is severe balance issues,  some missions feel like they rushed when they were designed, or perhaps lack of sufficient playtesting?    Overall, Majesty 2 isn't really that 'hard' per say, its more like finding one strategy for each map/mission that works and sticking with it, usually every other method results in  failure and frustration for the player.

												A fun game, but i don't think it is as good as the originial Majesty.Not sure what i did wrong but i was forced to do a real quest first, and then the tutorial second???Also the hero AI is pathetic, cmon why a stupid dumbass Lv 2 Archer, takes on 3 dragons is beyond me.Healers are OP in groups, they can't be killed.The difficulty fluctuates greatly, one level half way through the campaign, you are litterally forced to buy a level 2 wizard tower in the first 10 seconds, otherwise all your champions that you buy are instant killed by a global spell every 20 seconds. Basically forced me to survive the first 10 minutes on the map with 3 rouges.Or  when only going healers because they are the only unit that doesn't die ""Regularly"".Wish they had a continue button when you finished a level.A fun game, very time consuming, doesn't compare to the originality of the first Majesty, but still worth playing... barely.

												There's a lot that's good about it, but too many levels involve a wandering Big Bad who on a whim might wander into your town way too early for you to deal with them, smash 90% of your stuff, then wander off. Then 5 minutes later, when you've half-rebuilt, they come back. Game idea is great, but the unfair randomness is frustrating rather than challenging.			",85,64,2,25,44,1,39

												I really wanted to like this game, what with being a huge fan of the origianl, but I found myself screaming at the stupidity of the A.I. way too much to find this game entertaining past the first few levels. And since the only way to have any sort of control over the units is to plant reward signs over objectives, having competent A.I. is important, and yet Paradox managed to make the the ""heroes"" even dumber, greedier and shortsighted than in the original. Yes, I said greedier: Finding yourself wasting thousands of gold on glass cannon wizards because they repeatedly get tunnel vision and attempt to run past hordes of enemies for a pitiful bounty, only to act surprised when they're brutally mobbed, is nothing short of infuriating. Other times, heroes will ignore their homes being burnt to the ground because they're too busy buying new armor (and yes, in the original, they WERE capable of noticing when their home buildings were being attacked) or attempt to take on targets WAY above their league.Trial and error is a huge part of this game, which shouldn't be the case. Take the forth mission: I wouldn't have a problem with a massive dragon coming almost instantly to wreck havok to set the stage, but half the time it starts by immediately burning the buildings I just built to the ground, wasting huge amounts of my precious resources. And this was AFTER the narrator told me ""be careful not to alert the dragon, or he'll attack you before you're prepared""... which turns out is complete misinformation because the brute comes after you immediately no matter what.Get the original. Don't touch this garbage.			",650,273,16,102,63,9,138

Posted: February 2
												This game is quite simply an insult to fans who loved the original majesty (including me), i loved majesty 1 when my parents got it in the Winter of 2003 (oh so many years ago), it was one of those games that was one of the memories of my childhood. But enough of that, lets get to why this game is atrocious compared to the original Majesty.Paradoks decided apprantly that instead of developing this game themselves, they outsourced it to 1C, a company in Moscow that i guess have no idea what made the original so good. So what did 1C, (and Paradoks) screw up that made this game inferior to Majesty 1? the list is too long, but i will list the 3 biggest problems with majesty 2 with a paragraph for the first two problems, and a short summary for the third.First: AI: The AI in Majesty 2 is quite simply put, abysmal compared to majesty 1, your heroes seem to not have any personalities like Majesty 1. (ironic considering the subtitle: Fantasy Kingdom Sims) in majesty 2 heroes seem to have no motivation to do anything outside of Greed by placing reward flags for doing things. In majesty 1 heroes could be motivated by reward flags, but they did things on their own, warriors would raid monster lairs on their own because it fits their description of a glory seeking WARRIOR, rangers would explored the unexplored areas of your map and reveal on their own, healers would follow other heroes, because it would fit their noble nature and they were a real help for your warriors if they were fighting tough monsters. they also were smart enough (most of the time) to know when facing an enemy that was way above their heads, and would try to flee from unwinnable fights. In majesty 2 your heroes are so stubborn, they will try to fight monsters 15 levels above theirs and will get smashed to paste because they're stupid to run away. Oh but they do run away when they're wounded enough, to bad that when they do they often are literally one hit from death by anything, and they don't get away usually the monster is already in the attack animation and they die. they're also so stupid they will tunnel vision with their actions all the time. i can't tell you how many times a dragon flew right by my one of my warriors, and they don't notice each other, maybe they gave each other a funny look, but they move on. Heroes in Majesty 1 also had priorities to defend their homes if they were attacked. If your palace was attacked it would send out a call for help, and ALL your heroes (no matter their skill or level) would drop what they were doing and try to save your home because if you fall, then they fall.In Majesty 2 your palace can literally be ablaze in fire getting attacked by monsters and your heroes will not give a second look. all the AI in Majesty 2 seems to be centered around reward flags, and if you don't give them rewards they will not do anything. I must press on the importance, that with a strategy game where you can't directly control your units, you cannot screw up the AI to the point where they're so robot-like they might as well have made it into a RTS. Making it to where heroes will not do anything unless you give them rewards adds more needless micro-managing, for a game that focuses on macro-managing gameplay.Second: Quests: more specifically their difficulty, now Majesty 1 had problems with some of the quests rushing waves of enemies before you were ready, but they were few and far between and even then they did not have enemies right at your palace gates before one in-game day had passed.Having a boss be challenging because he/she is hard to get to is good difficulty because its not facing it before you're ready. Challenging gameplay does not include having bosses join in every so often with the aforemented dumb rushes of monsters to harrass your kingdom to screw up your attempt at setting up a base to get your kingdom up and running.Majesty 1 also did not have artificial difficulty by having steep learning curves that makes Dark Souls blush, where if you don't know/use the EXACT SAME strategy you will lose no matter what. The tutorial and the second mission is very laid back and a breeze, but when you get to Quest 3 the learning carve goes higher then Mount Everest. You will be attacked by monsters before your peasents even come out of their houses to build your buildings. because your Guards are so useless against any enemy stronger then a rat. have fun watching your peasents die over and over, as they try building your buildings, but they can't because they keep getting waylaided by the monsters that will be swarming your kingdom b4 they're done building.Third: Bugs: this game suffers from a bunch of bugs, but one bug that really stands out (or doesin't as the link i will provide will explain) is people with powerful PCs that have high FPS ( anything higher then 60 FPS) will suffer from a gamebreaking bug, where your peasents will build buildings slower. If you want more details, heres a link to a guy who found this out: http://steamcommunity.com/app/73020/discussions/0/458607518213324765/TL;DR: The first Majesty game had more thought ,more polish, and less bugs then this game. Go buy that if you're looking for a game where you feel like you're running a Sims game in a strategy genre. stay away from this botched attempt at a sequel.			",24,0,0,10,11,0,15

												The AI is terrible.This is coming from someone who played and loved Majesty 1: the AI in Majesty 2 is simply the worst. Heroes might just start ""protecting their lands"" and then happily watch as monsters destroy their home right before their eyes.In a Majesty game, AI is key. In a game where you can't really control your units, a bad AI can ruin everything.The original is far superior in everything but dimensions (As in: Majesty 2 has a third. Whether that is a good thing is still up to debate, though).Did I mention how terrible the early game of every single campaign mission is? Apparently, coding it so that monsters would give you enough time to build your first guild before attacking, would have been too much for some missions.This is evident by the draon mission in which the advisor tells you to stay clear of the dragon or it might attack too early. Well, apparently the programmers honest to god couldn't stop the dragon from spawning in the first minute, but no matter what you do, it's going to show up immediately.Not that the dragon is the only creature that can just show up and kill all your builders before you have a chance to do literally anything.

												I was a big fan of Majesty 1, and thought this would be similar with a few cool additions. Never have I been so wrong. The difficulty curve is insane. Before you even have a chance to build a decent stronghold with some high level heroes, you're being bounded by demon dragons and hellspawn and turn around to find all your bravest heroes cowering in their bunkers...until those are obliterated by demon fire and everyone dies. I thought the best part of Majesty 1 was building a kingdom, seeing your heroes grow and gain experience doing the minor side missions, then after spending a few moments admiring your beautifully rendered castle and surrounding accoutrements, sallying forth to lay waste to the bad guy. I guess they missed that in this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a frustrating unbelanced game. In a tipical mission you start with a palace and one guard, and you are constantly engaged by waves of enemies. If you are smart enouth to find the exact location to build your guild you may start to build up some heroes, and begin the game, but most of the time you will be simlpy anihilated by the enemy.

												Majesty 2 is a real-time strategy game, despite the game's pleas that it's a ""fantasy kingdom sim"". I found it to be very similar to Warcraft 2 in play style.I'm a big fan of RTS games, but this game just isn't worth your money. The game is based on a proven formula, but Majesty 2 is poorly executed. Most single player games end up the same way: you frantically fight for your life before you get your first buildings built, hope nothing major is destroyed, try to get up a few key buildings as monsters swarm your town, then all of a sudden, your heroes are mopping the floor with the enemy. It swings from frustrating to boring in seconds, never hitting the right balance.The tutorial is okay but doesn't quite teach enough. Controls need a little work. Music is boring. The game does have some decent dry humor.This game just isn't worth getting. RTS fans should boot up a Blizzard game instead.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												Majesty 2 takes everything that made Majesty 1 great and does it worse. Objectively speaking the game has way less in it, is more limited with hero variety, less in-depth when it comes to hero A.I, and a myriad of other flaws. I'll break down the systems.Town and Management:The biggest change to come is how stripped down the buildings are. A lot of the miscellanous building like the gardens, fairgrounds, and various other buildings are completely removed. You are now limited to only one marketplace, trading posts have to go in specific locations, you cannot have more than three of any hero building, temples may not only be built of specific spots. Having a cap on the amount of things that can be built isn't a bad thing, but having an arbitary cap takes away a lot of the fun. Especially when you can only have a very limited amount of heros. This also means that a lot of the fun in trying quirky builds is also gone.Building Placement:This will quickly become a major issue. Each building requires space larger than what the model indicates, but gives no indication of how much room is required. In the original each building had a green ring that indicated how much space it required so you know when a building couldn't fit. Now it is a guessing game and will have you asking ""Why can't this be placed here"".Heros, A.I, and Interactions:Heros are pretty dumb this time around, and while in Majesty 1 they have tendencies and preferred tactics (Rangers covering barbarians, Clerics following Warriors) each hero is much more indepenant which really takes away from the feeling that these were clans with backstory and personalities.The voices are also pretty weak but not because they are bad, but because there isn't enough variation. Heros sound very similar to each other and lack the variety that the original game set. There is some good sides though. The reward flags are not much better having the option to place defensive flags that reward heros for defending a section, fear flags that ward heros from wandering off into a dangerous location. There is also the ability to set default values for each flag so the player doesn't have to spend so much time mindlessly clicking to increase the reward value.Also, one hero from each mission can be carried over to the next scenario with all their ability and gear (though they are expensive to recruit). This means that you might actually care about the lives of your heros. Each hero also has different stats within a set range meaning that every hero is actual different.If this seems like a harsh review, it might be. Is this review uncalled for? No. This game is exactly how to do a sequel badly.			",126,17,0,15,10,0,16

												I reinstalled this game on a lark, but quickly discovered why I stopped playing the first time. Level design.In the first 4-5 missions, the game holds your hand through different objectives. You are expected to defend your town, but can generally work at your own pace.All this changes after you beat the mage. After that, you have two different missions to choose from. One starts you off surrounded by several monster-spawning sewers (where in previous games you might see one spawn every 10min), and the second mission has a frigging dragon and its spawn coming after you, right off the bat.The starter 'guard' is never enough to hold back the tide, which leaves you desperately building your guild halls hoping the monsters ignore the defenceless villagers WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD SAID GUILD HALLS. Of course the alternative is they go after the peasant houses which generate gold. So now you have guild halls, BUT NO ECONOMY TO BUY HEROES FROM SAID GUILD HALLS.I'm sure I could spend hours sifting through faqs and wikis until i finally have the 'trick', but this runs completely contrary to the whimsical first impression the game gives in those initial levels.

												Look. Theres aspects of this game that can be fun...wrapped in a shell of pure unadulterated annoyance. Your heroes are dumb as rocks and the only way you can get them to do ANYTHING is to bribe them, and they dont even respond well to that. meanwhile you have an endless spawn of mosters comming after you and fixed defences are expensive as hell and inefective. Even if you get to the point of being able to defend yourself and get your idiot heroes to buy upgrades and protect your base, you will lose the mission cause somthing accross the map just appeard that you need to protect, but then becomes the prime target of every monster around and they can get to it long before your heroes ever could even if they were motivated. Long of the short, you can beat missions eventually but it will feel like beating your skull against a very hard wall tiull your brains are jelly. Oh and theres no sandbox mode of any kind.

												This game sucks because it's called Majesty 2 and it's nothing like the original Majesty. If they had called it something else I would have given it a pass as a spinoff, but a numbered sequel should be judged by how well it lives up to the core experience of the game comes from. Majesty 2 is not a spiritual successor to Majesty, it's not a sim game at all, it's an RTS. The AI Monsters just run straight towards the castle on auto attack paths never doing anything truly interesting or immersive. The heroes don't even wander about on their own and never take their time doing anything sim like. The indirect control sounds similar to describe but is functionally very different because the heroes don't act like heroes they act like mindless patrol drones.This game has the base level charm but none of the soul of Majesty. I'm intentionally using metaphysical sounding words because I know a certain soulless corporate robot with contempt for Majesty fans is incapable of comprehending their meaning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR - While Majesty 2 doesn’t quite live up to the promise of the original Majesty it still delivers hours of fun. Worth buying for fans of the original game or the strategy genre in general.Majesty 2 remains true to the gameplay of Majesty - instead of building up an army and marching your soldiers to destroy an enemy’s base, you have to construct a small town around your castle in order to ensure that the heroes you recruit have all that they need to be successful. Heroes can’t be controlled directly, but their actions are a reflection of their class (e.g. Rangers like exploring, Rogues like to steal) and of the rewards banners that you put up. While the original game had only two flags (attack and explore) - Majesty 2 adds a host of others, such as a “defend” flag. Veterans of the original will also notice a few tweaks both major (temples can only be built in certain locations) and minor (paladins are now men) to the gameplay. Unfortunately, a few drawbacks keep Majesty 2 from fully living up to its potential. The game is fun, and it's nice to see Majesty get a visual reboot after all these years, but some of the quests inch towards the tedious - particularly in the expansions. The AI is also not very good, and convincing your heroes to do your bidding somehow seems to be harder than in the original game.			",121,21,1,34,10,0,23

												The game is an interesting little grindy timewaster but the depth is minimal here.I don't really see any improvement or expansion from majesty 1 aside from a graphical upgrade.The game is slowed down a whole bunch from majesty 1 with the removal of the gnome heroes. buildings take forever to construct. The heroes aren't expanded upon a whole bunch and neither are the enemies, much of the same as majesty 1 just slower.The party system is a good addition but the poor AI doesn't make it all that worthwhile. The lords system to me just seems pointless. The heroes individually dont have much character, It's difficult to get attached to them as they have a tendency to die often.I'd like to see the gameplay revisited sometime but with more options in terms of hero development or base building. It feels rather hollow and grindy after a certain point and needs some more depth to it. especially when heroes get to higher levels.Reccomend it for a cheap time waster if on sale. Not otherwise.

												Ive owned this game 6 years, and having just finished another play-through i thought it time to write a review :pI return to this game often. it is one of the best RTS ever imo. The twist of only being able to indirectly influence your ""units"" (via a flag system of rewards that you have to pay for) makes it refreshing and stand out from the pack. Replayability is immense due to the randomise set-up option. Your units are heros (individual archers, warriors, mages, healers etc) that level and gear up as you progress through any given mission. You can also carry over up to 3 of them to subsequent missions. Once you research the prerequisite you can organise them into parties of up to 4 individuals (i use classic tank/healer/2xdps). The game looks beautiful, plays smooth and bug-free, and never fails to satisfy. The voice acting is extemely well acted and the lines well-written and amusing.i have two small gameplay dislikes:1) all the heroes have to physically gather at the selected inn in order to form parties. while youre waiting for the correct  last member to arrive the rest of your settlement is vulnerable (and it can take a while).2) The building placement is affected by the corpses (represented by amusing little gravestone markers) of fallen enemies. You have to wait for them to despawn before you can place a building. bear in mind theres constant spawning of rats from sewers and skeletons from your graveyard withing your settlement almost ""from the word go"", this can be quite irritating as your trying to lay out your buildings.Other than these minor gripes, the game is an absolutle joy. a real gem. I can not recommend it highly enough to a wide variety of players and play-styles. In my opinion is an unsung and hidden gem amongst a lot of over-hyped garbage. I am sure you can pick it up for peanuts in a sale, but iirc its very cheap even at full price.Highly, highly recommended. You will certainly get a very good return for your money.

You get ravaged by monsters and the Boss before you have anything to defend with. And many levels after it are the same.Only way to beat this game is with an extreme learning curve. You must know the entire mission, placement of everything on the map etc, before you even start. The entire idea/point of the game is lost. Impossible to play some levels without following strict uncompromising strategy guides.Majesty 2 had potential to be very cool game. Great idea, style and simple fun game dynamics. But the developers have patched the game to the point some levels are impossible for new players. Majesty 2 is now only playable by highly experienced players.Idea/Potential/style: 8/10game difficulty: 1/10 (Impossible for beginners) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Did you like the original Majesty? Are you looking for a similar game? Keep looking.This game made some amazing changes from the inn upradable to allow your heroes to form parties, to the trading posts having an arrows upgrade that is similar to the tower upgrade.However, the absolutely terrible gameplay more than dashes any hope that this game could in any way be considered fun. Everything I could find that was good about the game has an opposite that makes it worse. Sure heroes can be in parties but their AI is now worse and are themselves more time-consuming and costly to upgrade. Sure trading posts can have arrows upgrades but your castle can be destroyed before your peasants construct a single building. Sure temples are limited to a couple locations spread randomly in the unscouted map but there also isn't a custom map mode. Oops those were both bad. I meant, but there also is no longer a tournament grounds.			",112,14,0,45,14,0,45

												Basically the idea behind this game is that you build adventurer's guilds and they do all the monster-slaying while you keep the economy circulating by setting up stores for them to spend their money at. In practice what happens is you spend five minutes watching them run away from skeletons before an ogre turns up and smashes your castle into rubble. You will sit there, weeping openly, as not only do you lack the funds to resurrect any of your ""heroes"" but their presence in the graveyard causes it to spawn ten-foot skeleton kings armed with blades forged from pure evil.Oh there are also timed missions and ones where you have to avoid taking on the ""boss monster"" except the boss monster can turn up in your town in the first 5 minutes just because the AI decided it wanted to walk west instead of east.Get this game if your idea of ""fun"" is listening to a Sean Connery impersonator repeatedly tell you you are out of gold while everything dies.

												★★★☆☆An interesting take on RTS.  You don't have direct control of your troops.  Instead, its more like an MMO simulator.  You build guilds for warriors, rangers, and rogues.  Then they wander around on their own, killing monsters, collecting gold, spending it on potions and equipment in your markets.  You can try to direct them, by setting quest objectives, gold for attacking targets or exploring areas.  + Music+ Intuitive UI+ Good tutorial+ Fantasy setting+ Sean Connery: Royal Advisor+ Group units into MMO style parties+ Carryover heroes between missions+ Visual upgrades for buildings and units+ Units levelup, learn abilities, and collect gold+ Peasents build buildings, tax collectors gather gold+ Each building of the same type costs more than the last.  An interesting way to encourage build variety and unit limits, without putting simple hardcaps on them.  +- Decent graphics, considering its age and genre+- You can't build walls, though you can build guard towers- Gold gathering is far too slow, usually idle waiting for it to collect- Game gets crazy hard on some Expert campaign missions.  I'm not sure its even possible to beat them, unless theres some mechanic I'm missing- Being able to freely place buildings is a bit clunky, hard to tell where they'll fit in, would be nice if they could snap to a grid, at least optionally.* There is multiplayer, but I've never tried it.  It's run by GameSpy, which I'm not sure even exists anymore.  Maybe LAN mode still works, if you have friends.			",302,25,6,60,22,1,51

												I played a lot of the original Majesty as a kid, and I loved the style of the game. Everything about that is in Majesty 2, and then some. Great variations on themes, and new concepts to play around with. Additionally, Majesty 2 brings a great deal of challenge to the table. Heroes are a little harder to incentivize, and as they level up they want greater rewards. I've found some of the ""advanced"" campaign missions to actually be incredibly difficult. However, with good strategy some objectives are hardly an obstacle. Great game for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Could be a fun game, quirky but fun. The basics fairly easy to pickup. Can be a bit brutal & overwealm you with enemies but ok if your patience & plan ahead but...The game crashes 90% of the time when you try to save which basically makes the game unplayable. Shame as its otherwise a good game.			",34,7,22,42,66,6,77

												I bought this game as a physical copy when it came out, but never got to play it. Then I bought it again on here to try it out.I'm sorry I did.The main problem really is that your heroes are never where they're needed, or die so much which wastes your resources and creates the graveyard. Just... disappointing. Maybe try the first game instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really, really did.But when you are on an Expert level,  you are powerless against waves upon waves of relentless enemies.The level I was stuck on I tried over 30 times. 30!I could NEVER survive past 45 days. Gold is limited, need towers to defend, enemies (even ones spawning from your graveyard and sewers) can destroy it before its built. Yay.I'll just stick with the first Majesty.

												Hello there majesty. Your kingdom Ardania is awaiting your orders.In this game you are the king, ruler of a magical land. Too bad not everybody sees it that way. Luckily for you there are plenty of heroes to recruit that will (gladly) fight for you. As long as your treasury doesn't run out of gold that is.By placing bounties, constructing new buildings and researching new items/spells you control your kingdom. You can hire heroes and facilitate them. Pro's:+ Good graphics, everything has a magic, medieval feel to it.+ It's nice that you can turn heroes into lords and make them reappear in later levels. Although quite useless as you have to pay more the higher the level of your lord.+ You can group heroes, making combinations that suit the objectives. Making them far more dangerous, read destructive.Cons:- The game is very repetitive. Although the missions are different, and some require a slightly different approach, for most of the missions you'll be doing the same.- The campaign is short. There's only a few missions, there are 2 or 3 DLC's available though.- The DLC's don't work together with the main game, you'll have to choose which 'version' you'd like to play on start-up.All in all a fun game for as long as it lasts. I must say that I still play it from time to time when I'm bored, but never for long. If it's on sale, a great game to pick up. Else I wouldn't recommend it. Hence a no for me.

												I love the original Majesty. I play it over and over again even though I've beaten it so many times. I was so excited for this sequel. It does have some good. The new graphics look good, although I think some units look less inspired than the previous game. The voice and comedy are still around. But the heroes never seem to do anything but run away. You never seem to have enough money for all the flags. And one of the things that frustrated me the most was that the game seems to have hidden trigger points in its levels, like when you build a certain building or have a certain number of heroes, that when this trigger is hit the game sends a horde of enemies at you. So many hordes all the time. Eventually I just got tired of this.			",133,26,1,24,16,0,31

												I paid for both the standard Majesty 2 and the Monster Kingdom Expansion. While Majesty 2 gets boring, I was looking forward to the Monster Kingdom. However, the game is unplayable. You can't get past the Power of Minotaurs, and there is no Single Mission to use the Monster races. All of the ""hype"" on Steam about it was thoroughly misleading and false. I do not reccomend this game, or trust of Steam in how they advertise thier product sales. I will be speaking to a lawyer as everything I read, and took a photo of, never said this game was unplayable, nor did it say you couldn't use the Monster races in Single Mission. With that said, I hope no one buys this game again or trusts Steam on thier lies of advertising. I do not reccomend using Steam.			",27,4,0,8,4,0,1

												Loved the original game ... but this bad boy really defines anyone who's into masochism. The initial levels are easy but once you start venturing further into the game, the difficulty scaling becomes insane. Unless you are a RTS hero or really into replaying a level multiple times, some of the levels are truly difficult. There's no difficulty setting so your best bet is to just watch some Youtube players beat the game in order to see what build order they did.But that seems to defeat the purpose of finding your own way and enjoying the ""Sim"" portion of it. Overall, I'm glad I got this on one of those holiday sales so I'm not too perturbed about the quality of the game play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally didn't like it.  The beginning was mildly entertaining but it quickly began to get too hard to play.  You would start a round with little to no resources and be surrounded by the opposing force.  You'd have to find the one strategy to get you further into the game (after multiple restarts) just to advance.  I want a game that's challenging but this just took it to a whole new level.

												For fans of the original Majesty, this one will come as a severe disappointment. It might be ok on its own, to people new to the 'series,' but for anyone who has played the first installment, it just doesn't measure up. Custom maps, afaik, are completely unavailable, which, for me, was one big plus of the original. Also, it does not have that same fantasy feel to it; probably something about the cartoony graphics.I hesitate to say it's a 'bad' game, it just isn't that great, and replayability is low, at least for me.

												Overall, a worthy sequal to the beloved fantasy kingdom sim of yore.  I admit there are some aspects of the game that I don't like- for example, temples can only be built on limited holy sites.  Enemy AI directs them right at your kingdom, meaning that your town is under constant seige.  Many of the missions are absurdly difficult.  However, they've made some excellent improvements to the gameplay as well.  You can research special attacks for your heroes to use, increasing their effectiveness.  New bounty flags are super handy, especially the ""Protect"" flag.  While hero ai is still questionable, they can now recognize the collective threat posed by multiple enemies, which they couldn't in the previous game.  Overall, I'd say if you liked Majesty back in the day, go ahead and pick this up when it's on sale.  It isn't an amazing game, but it is decent, and more importantly, its Majesty.

												The original Majesty came out over 10 years ago, and was one of my favorite games of all time.  The sequal does not disappoint in that reguard I love it just as much as the original.It's a fantasy kingdom simulator, a strange style of RTS, where you build your town and defenses, but instead of directly influencing where your heroes go by selecting and clicking where you want them to go, you place bounties on monsters, or explore locations, and they will get interested and go to that area, they will go to the market in town and buy potions, sleep at the Inn to recover, or go to the smithy to buy new armor and weapons.  The game has a great sense of humor and a great presentation. If nothing else give the demo a shot, but I have to think anyone would love this game.			",435,50,15,67,25,4,65

												Was never really into sim games tbh. This game changed really brings both a lot of enjoyment and a lot of pain. Some missions are painstakingly hard to get started, but overall its a good difficulty for those who enjoy a challenge. Basically, a very good and unique blend of say the sims vs age of mytholgy kinda..You dont farm for resouces, gold is your only resource which you increase by building certain economic buildings and providing potions/armor and upgrades for your units. The more you find for them to do, the quicker they will both level up & gear up.You have attack, defend and fear flags to place where you put bounties on units/buiildings or unexplored terrain.Not a game for people that cant handle rage. This game WILL make you rage. But you will love it all the more for it later..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First Off...you have to ignore some of the reviews. This game isn't as bad as some have made it out to be. The core concept is very close to the original majesty game; its just that they decided to make it very random, which leads to some very hard missions. Rather than taking a few extra months at tweaking the AI and game play, the developers seemed to have said ""Screw it, we can make this really challenging by creating maps with fast spawning monster generators next to the players base and call it a day.""The patches have fixed numerous issues, but I would not recommed that you get this on steam. The reason being is that based on the date of this review they have only released 1 of the 3 expansion packs, and it does not seem that steam will be porting the others anytime soon. For some reason they have also opted to excluded the Paradox Store, meaning that you will not have access to some of the DLC provided by the expansion packs. The same goes for the IMPULSE version of the game.			",225,63,0,37,29,4,27

The only con I can really Think of is why they didn't incorperate the old Cheat codes. Make it alittle more easier for the New players.			",48,10,0,18,5,2,9

												First Off...you have to ignore some of the reviews. This game isn't as bad as some have made it out to be. The core concept is very close to the original majesty game; its just that they decided to make it very random, which leads to some very hard missions. Rather than taking a few extra months at tweaking the AI and game play, the developers seemed to have said ""Screw it, we can make this really challenging by creating maps with fast spawning monster generators next to the players base and call it a day.""The patches have fixed numerous issues, but I would not recommed that you get this on steam. The reason being is that based on the date of this review they have only released 1 of the 3 expansion packs, and it does not seem that steam will be porting the others anytime soon. For some reason they have also opted to excluded the Paradox Store, meaning that you will not have access to some of the DLC provided by the expansion packs. The same goes for the IMPULSE version of the game.			",225,63,0,37,29,4,27

												I am on the edge regarding my thoughts on this game as I have played few hundreds of hours of the first Majesty. Which just means that I shouldn't recommend it.There are few things that could may you sway towards liking the game. Such as trailers showing heroes making parties, like in an MMO. You think, cool so you kinda manage your mini-MMO. But it turns out only when you reach a special building do parties get formed. Even that is not enough though, you have to do it manually. Otherwise heroes don't form parties, in fact they practically ignore each other. This is the main reason I do not recommend this. This game was made at a time when MMOs became so popular, a new Majesty should have taken many tips from them.			",84,1,1,15,13,0,35

												Majesty 2 takes an original approach to the tired fantasy-adventurer trope by putting you in control of the town the adventurers visit! Sell potions, create quests, build guild halls and watch as heroes bumble about looking for gold and glory.The player builds a very basic medieval-style town by placing shops, guilds and defensive structures, while peasant houses, graveyards and sewer exits appear on their own, making for a unique town layout each time you play. Watching the heroes accomplish quests and then spend their hard-earned gold in your shops is immensely satisfying, and the humour is surprisingly effective.The game is not without a few shortcomings. Your lack of direct control over the heroes will mean that you will occasionally fail time-sensitive quests, and certain missions are in major need of some balancing. On more than one occasion I found myself having to consult online forums to see what I was doing wrong.Despite these few shortcomings, however, I find myself re-installing Majesty 2 again and again, months after having finished it, just to play it through completely once more.

												A great Fantasy game!  You are the King of Ardania and you must protect it from different threats.  There is a main campaign and also single missions that are unrelated.  You manage and build and try to expand a fantasy town.  You can build different Guilds that house heroes such as Warriors, Priests, Wizards, Hunters, and Thieves along with Dwarves or Elves.  Different missions require different heroes to accomplish your goal.  You don't control the heroes specifically, but as the King you put bounties on Enemies you want killed, areas you want explored, and buildings or people you want defended.  A very fun strategy/RPG.  Depending on the quest you can spend 2 or 3 hours just finishing a single mission.			",46,24,0,36,5,0,15

												The idea of Majesty 2 is interesting: an RTS that gives you ""indirect"" control of the units by setting objectives on the map that ""inspire"" the units to respond.  As such, the tactical options are a bit limiting, nevermind things like formations.  The world is colorful and fun to look at.  The game is, however, punishingly hard and a bit repetitive.  Enemy units will often spam you relentlessly at the start of a new map making gaining a foothold an hour-long event.  If you are a hardcore RTS fan (Men of War anyone?), give this one a look just for the fresh perspective... wait for it to go on sale though.			",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												It is a fun medieval fantasy game for those interested in strategy and rpg elements. It runs in the same vein as Hinterlands and Folk Tale: build guilds and recruit heroes who fight and level up. The campaign follows your rise to the throne as narrated by your light-hearted advisor. Some levels are quite difficult, but it should only take 15-20 hours to beat the game (faster if you know what you are doing). Your heroes have to fight skeletons, werewolves, ogres, etc. so that you can defeat the Demon that stole the throne. I would value this game at $5, so wait for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a sim/RTS hybrid sounds a little weird but that’s what it is. You don’t directly control your units, they control themselves. What you do is choose what kind of units are created and attract them with rewards. It’s a very neat concept and plays out pretty well (aside from the final level which is flap-jacking hard!). It has pretty slow pacing and suffers from the same RTS elements where you start each map at ground zero but if you enjoy either half its worth a go.			",154,27,0,22,20,2,15

												This game has so many things that will just make you want to punch your monitor.  The first few levels are fun, but eventually you get to the dragon level and you have no chance in hell to have a level 1 character survive.  The scripting is horrible and in no way could this have been play tested.  So- you build a lord hall and parade out your Level 19 characters - and even those get killed - and not by the boss of the level, but by the random creatures (elemental placed right next to my town) in the game.  And this isn't something that is a flaw in just that level.  I saw this in each of the next levels also - of course I could only get to them with a money cheat, and at that point it isn't any fun anymore.  I do love the concept of the game.

												I like this Game, a lot. Look at the hours I’ve spent playing it. It feels like a simple Simcity, but fantasy themed. Build your city, upgrade buildings, hire heroes and then pay them to go on quest, defend your city or kill monsters.The Humor in Majesty II is fantastic. I stay amused by the “Plot” of the campaign, but this is not a deeply affecting story. Ultimately if you like the management part of an RTS (Like Command & Conquer, or Warcraft) but you don’t want to deal with all that pesky war stuff; then this is the game for you.I highly recommend this for casual or serious gamers looking for something fun. Majesty II is low stress, lots of fun and it makes you use your mind in way that is just slightly different then you average RTS or management Sim. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still a great game. It's a different take on the genre, where you use gold to influence heroes to do your will, instead of directly assigning them tasks that they mindlessly follow. Worth the price of admission!			",34,22,0,13,14,0,6

												I really like this game.  This is an RTS.  You build a few shops and build guilds where you can build ""heroes"".  All your units are heroes.  The more buildings and heroes you have, the more taxes you get.  Here is where the game gets original.  You have no (direct) control over the heroes.  They wander about and do as they wish and buy goods from your shops (gaining you more money).  To get them to do what you want you have to bribe them.  Want an area of the map revealed?  Put a dollar amount on it, the more you put on it the faster it gets done and the more heroes show up.  The tricky part is that unless they are close to enemies you have to bribe them to attack them or to defend your buildings or attack an enemy building.  I would have played all the way through this game except for an absurdly hard level that is timed and forces you to memorize the map.  The collection is worth 20 bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's really more of an expansion for the original Majesty than a sequel.The units are mostly (entirely?) the same.  The gameplay is the same.  The hero incentives are the same.  The base building is only slightly altered.  The music is absolutely terrible.  I turned it off after 5 minutes.  The campaign narration and text might as well not be there.  The campaign has no incentive to replay, and the missions are all pretty much the same.  Additionally, the lords system is too weak to be useful or fun.  The standalone single player missions are probably better than the campaign msisions.The game's interface has some problems.  There is no option to customize hotkeys.  There are not hotkeys for frequently clicked spell abilities.  The camera movement has no insta-move-- only scroll.  There is no hotkey to jump to the last notification message. The base game is certainly worth the $2.50.The monster Kingdom expansion is a failure. The monster AI seems to have worse AI than the vanilla.  It can be very difficult to get units to attack or explore at times.  It has typos in several places.  The unit balance has problems. Some missions frequently crash.I'd recommend staying away from the Monster Kingdom expansion.			",137,28,1,34,12,0,18

												A very interesting game. It mixes RTS and RPG elements in a very unique way. You do not directly control units or armies. Instead you build towns to control population. Then you create objectives, or bounties for the heroes (NPCs) to complete for gold, thereby giving them incentive to do the things you need done. When they ge ta bounty, it allows them to buy better gear, and potions, etc making them even more effective. It's actually quite fun, and totally worth snagging when it's on sale.

												If like me, you have always wanted to be the THE KING, but not bear any responsibility then this fun little chem is for you. This is indeed a real time stategy game where you don't really control your unites. Sounds odd? - well its not! Its brilliant but emotionally confusing, which is an odd mix some might say. The bottom line is, you build and plan you ""base"" and units as you do in any RTS but they manage themselves so you don't have to hassle with the micro or actually unit control almost at all. Its way more relaxed then lets say Starcraft but a bit more tense than CIV.			",536,158,36,44,48,7,108
