												Bad interface, bad graphics, bad gameplay. I though the next gen Ironclad games (Chincha Islands, High Seas, Schleswig War, Anglo-Russian War) would be better. Well, they're almost good ones, but NOT enough.			",63,11,1,28,13,0,26

												Beyond bad, graphics so bad its hard to tell what is even going on, no tutorial, minimail instructions and the UI is nonsensical. Probably the worst game I've played on PC which is saying something....			",140,19,0,18,19,2,50

												Yeah.... um, kinda boring spending half your time waiting for the little ships to chug chug chug around the screen.  Add in wierd ships that suddently get three movement phases, really odd damage effects, and a REALLY irritating sound score and you're going to want to avoid this one.			",157,9,3,19,35,2,13

												Hello and welcome to my review of Ironclads: American Civil War. Where do I begin with this piece of crap. First things first, a key feature that is in every modern game is not there, an options menu. Without the ability to a just sound, resolution, and other normal options, this game is a pain as the music is way too loud. When you start a level, you have to click a button to begin loading, I sat there for 7 minutes thinking somthin was wrong with the game, I would understand if you had to begin the level, but to begin loading, and it doesnt help that the sound stops completely so you think the game is frozen. Then when you get into the level there is no tutorial what so ever, nothing that tells you what to do or how to do it. This wouldnt be a problem if there werent so many damn commads to give. All you d know is that there is enemy ships near by and you have to destroy them, thats it, thats all they tell you. The ships move in a stiff path that either curves way more than you wanted to or is to straight, attacks have bare minimum animation. Bottom line, this game sucks,  and the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 1/10 is the fact that is the Civil War, and I got it for 90% off ($  .99). Ironclads: American Civil War gets a 2/10, dont buy this game, it has no redeeming qualities.			",140,19,3,18,20,2,28

												I don't recomend buying this game. Don't buy it unless it is below $2.00. It's pretty bad. The gaphics are horrible. The gameplay was evan worse. It wouldn't let me finish my turn every now and then. I had to re-load the game over and over. There ais no way to change the controls or sound level. On the first level it just threw you in the game. It took me 2 hours to complete the first level. The only reason i kept playing was because I was determined to beat the first level. I read the other reviews and ignored them and thought, it's the Civil War it can't be that bad. I love to study the Confedercy and I am a proud Alabama patriot. The game overall was horrible. Just because it was the Civil War I would have to give it a 2/10. The game producers could have made it a really good game. If they had just made the first level on 20 turns at the maximum ,tried to fix the mechanics, and added buildings or forts to the game. I see what they where going for but they failed. (Although I did enjoy watching and moving my little ironclad and gunboats for about 10-15 minutes. Than I realized this game would last for a long, long time.)			",41,1,0,1,7,0,5

												No options menu, no skirmish mode, no tutorial. I go, you go type turnbased gameplay isn't suitable for naval combat. Very very very bad game. It's bad, awfull, did i say it's bad? This actually is one of the worst games i ever played.			",22,5,0,5,32,1,22
